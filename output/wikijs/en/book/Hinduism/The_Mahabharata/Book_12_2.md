## SECTION CLXXIV

(_Mokshadharma Parva_)

“YUDHISHTHIRA SAID, ‘THOU hast, O grandsire, discoursed upon the auspicious duties (of person in distress) connected with the duties of kings. It behoveth thee now, O king, to tell me those foremost of duties which belong to those who lead the (four) modes of life.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Religion hath many doors. The observance of (the duties prescribed by) religion can never be futile. Duties have been laid down with respect to every mode of life. (The fruits of those duties are invisible, being attainable in the next world.) The fruits, however, of Penance directed towards the soul are obtainable in this world. [^0] Whatever be the object to which one devotes oneself, that object, O Bharata, and nothing else, appears to one as the highest of acquisitions fraught with the greatest of blessings. When one reflects properly (one's heart being purified by such reflection), one comes to know that the things of this world are as valueless as straw. Without doubt, one is then freed from attachment in respect of those things. When the world, O Yudhishthira, which is full of defects, is so constituted, every man of intelligence should strive for the attainment of the emancipation of his soul.’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, by what frame of soul should one kill one's grief when one loses one's wealth, or when one's wife, or son, or sire, dies.’

“Bhishma said, ‘When one's wealth is lost, or one's wife or son or sire is dead, one certainly says to oneself ‘Alas, this is a great sorrow!’ But then one should, by the aid of reflection, seek to kill that sorrow. In this connection is cited the old story of the speech that a regenerate friend of his, coming to Senajit's court, made to that king. Beholding the monarch agitated with grief and burning with sorrow on account of the death of his son, the <span id="p2"><sup><small>[ p. 2 ]</small></sup></span> Brahmana addressed that ruler of very cheerless heart and said these words, ‘Why art thou stupefied? Thou art without any intelligence. Thyself an object of grief, why dost thou grieve (for others)? A few days hence others will grieve for thee, and in their turn they will be grieved for by others. Thyself, myself, and others who wait upon thee, O king, shall all go to that place whence all of us have come.’

“Senajit said, ‘What is that intelligence, what is that penance, O learned Brahmana, what is that concentration of mind, O thou that hast wealth of asceticism, what is that knowledge, and what is that learning, by acquiring which thou dost not yield to sorrow?’

“The Brahmana said, ‘Behold, all creatures,—the superior, the middling, and the inferior,—in consequence of their respective acts, are entangled in grief. I do not regard even my own self to be mine. On the other hand, I regard the whole world to be mine. I again think that all this (which I see) is as much mine as it belongs to others. Grief cannot approach me in consequence of this thought. Having acquired such an understanding, I do not yield either to joy or to grief. As two pieces of wood floating on the ocean come together at one time and are again separated, even such is the union of (living) creatures in this world. Sons, grandsons, kinsmen, relatives are all of this kind. One should never feel affection for them, for separation with them is certain. Thy son came from an invisible region. He has departed and become invisible. He did not know thee. Thou didst not know him. Who art thou and for whom dost thou grieve? Grieve arises from the disease constituted by desire. Happiness again results from the disease of desire being cured. From joy also springs sorrow, and hence sorrow arises repeatedly. Sorrow comes after joy, and joy after sorrow. The joys and sorrows of human beings are revolving on a wheel. After happiness sorrow has come to thee. Thou shalt again have happiness. No one suffers sorrow for ever, and no one enjoys happiness for ever. The body is the refuge of both sorrow and happiness. [^1] Whatever acts an embodied creature does with the aid of his body, the consequence thereof he has to suffer in that body. Life springs with the springing of the body into existence. The two exist together, and the two perish together. [^2] Men of uncleansed souls, wedded to worldly things by various bonds, meet with destruction like embankments of sand in water. Woes of diverse kinds, born of ignorance, act like pressers of oil-seeds, for assailing all creatures in consequence of their attachments. These press them like oil-seeds in the oil-making machine represented by the round of rebirths (to which they are subject). Man, for the sake of his wife (and others), commits numerous evil acts, but suffers singly diverse kinds of misery both in this and the next world. All men, attached to children and wives and kinsmen and relatives, sink in the miry sea of grief like wild elephants, when destitute of strength, sinking in a miry slough. Indeed. O lord, upon loss of wealth or <span id="p3"><sup><small>[ p. 3 ]</small></sup></span> son or kinsmen or relatives, man suffers great distress, which resembles as regards its power of burning, a forest conflagration. All this, _viz_., joy and grief, existence and non-existence, is dependent upon destiny. One having friends as one destitute of friends, one having foes as one destitute of foes, one having wisdom as one destitute of wisdom, each and every one amongst these, obtains happiness through destiny. Friends are not the cause of one's happiness. Foes are not the cause of one's misery. Wisdom is not competent to bring an accession of wealth; nor is wealth competent to bring an accession of happiness. Intelligence is not the cause of wealth, nor is stupidity the cause of penury. He only that is possessed of wisdom, and none else, understands the order of the world. Amongst the intelligent, the heroic, the foolish, the cowardly, the idiotic, the learned, the weak, or the strong, happiness comes to him for whom it is ordained. Among the calf, the cowherd that owns her, and the thief, the cow indeed belongs to him who drinks her milk. [^3] They whose understanding is absolutely dormant, and they who have attained to that state of the mind which lies beyond the sphere of the intellect, succeed in enjoying happiness. Only they that are between the two classes, suffer misery. [^4] They that are possessed of wisdom delight in the two extremes but not in the states that are intermediate. The sages have said that the attainment of any of these two extremes constitutes happiness. Misery consists in the states that are intermediate between the two. [^5] They who have succeeded in attaining to real felicity (which _samadhi_ can bring), and who have become free from the pleasures and pains of this world, and who are destitute of envy, are never agitated by either the accession of wealth or its loss. They who have not succeeded in acquiring that intelligence which leads to real felicity, but who have transcended folly and ignorance (by the help of a knowledge of the scriptures), give way to excessive joy and excessive misery. Men destitute of all notions of right or wrong, insensate with pride and with success over others, yield to transports of delight like the gods in heaven. [^6] Happiness must end in misery. Idleness is misery; while cleverness (in action) is the cause of happiness. Affluence and prosperity dwell in one possessed of cleverness, but not in one that is idle. Be it happiness or be it misery, be it agreeable or be it disagreeable, what comes to one should be enjoyed or <span id="p4"><sup><small>[ p. 4 ]</small></sup></span> endured with an unconquered heart. Every day a thousand occasions for sorrow, and hundred occasions for fear assail the man of ignorance and folly but not the man that is possessed of wisdom. Sorrow can never touch the man that is possessed of intelligence, that has acquired wisdom, that is mindful of listening to the instructions of his betters, that is destitute of envy, and that is self-restrained. Relying upon such an understanding, and protecting his heart (from the influences of desire and the passions), the man of wisdom should conduct himself here. Indeed, sorrow is unable to touch him who is conversant with that Supreme Self from which everything springs and unto which everything disappears. [^7] The very root of that for which grief, or heartburning, or sorrow is felt or for which one is impelled to exertion, should, even if it be a part of one's body, be cast off. That object, whatever it may be in respect of which the idea of _meum_ is cherished, becomes a source of grief and heart-burning. Whatever objects, amongst things that are desired, are cast off become sources of happiness. The man that pursues objects of desire meets with destruction in course of the pursuit. Neither the happiness that is derived from a gratification of the senses nor that great felicity which one may enjoy in heaven, approaches to even a sixteenth part of the felicity which arises from the destruction of all desires. The acts of a former life, right or wrong, visit, in their consequences, the wise and the foolish, the brave and the timid. It is even thus that joy and sorrow, the agreeable and the disagreeable, continually revolve (as on a wheel) among living creatures. Relying upon such an understanding, the man of intelligence and wisdom lives at ease. A person should disregard all his desires, and never allow his wrath to get the better of him. This wrath springs in the heart and grows there into vigour and luxuriance. This wrath that dwells in the bodies of men and is born in their minds, is spoken of by the wise as Death. When a person succeeds in withdrawing all his desires like a tortoise withdrawing all its limbs, then his soul, which is self-luminous, succeeds in looking into itself. [^8] That object, whatever it may be, in respect of which the idea of _meum_ is cherished, becomes a source of grief and heart-burning. [^9] When a person himself feels no fear, and is feared by no one, when he cherishes no desire and no aversion, he is then said to attain to the state of _Brahma_. Casting off both truth and falsehood, grief and joy, fear and courage, the agreeable and the disagreeable, thou mayst become of tranquil soul. When a person abstains from doing wrong to any creature, in thought, word, or deed, he is then said to attain to a state of _Brahma_. True happiness is his who can cast off that thirst which is incapable of being cast off by the misguided, which does not decay with decrepitude, and which is regarded as a fatal disease. In this connection, O king, are heard <span id="p5"><sup><small>[ p. 5 ]</small></sup></span> the verses sung by Pingala about the manner in which she had acquired eternal merit even at a time that had been very unfavourable. A fallen woman of the name of Pingala, having repaired to the place of assignation, was denied the company of her lover through an accident. At that time of great misery, she succeeded in acquiring tranquillity of soul.’

“Pingala said, ‘Alas, I have for many long years lived, all the while overcome by frenzy, by the side of that Dear Self in whom there is nothing but tranquillity. Death has been at my door. Before this, I did not, however approach that Essence of Purity. I shall cover this house of one column and nine doors (by means of true Knowledge). [^10] What woman is there that regards that Supreme Soul as her dear lord, even when He comes near? [^11] I am now awake. I have been roused from the sleep of ignorance. I am no longer influenced by desire. Human lovers, who are really the embodied forms of hell, shall no longer deceive me by approaching me lustfully. Evil produces good through the destiny or the acts of a former life. Roused (from the sleep of ignorance), I have cast off all desire for worldly objects. I have acquired a complete mastery over my senses. One freed from desire and hope sleeps in felicity. Freedom from every hope and desire is felicity. Having driven off desire and hope, Pingala sleeps in felicity.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Convinced with these and other words uttered by the learned Brahmana, king Senajit (casting off his grief), experienced delight and became very happy.’”

## SECTION CLXXV

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Time, which is destructive of every created thing, is passing on. [^12] Tell me, O grandsire, what is that good thing which should be sought.’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection, O king, is cited the old narrative of a discourse between sire and son, O Yudhishthira! A certain Brahmana. O Partha, who was devoted to the study of the Vedas, got a very intelligent son who (for this) was called Medhavin. [^13] One day, the son, well conversant with the truths of the religion of Emancipation, and acquainted also with the affairs of the world, addressed his sire devoted to the study of the Vedas.’

“The son said, ‘What should a wise man do, O father, seeing that the period of human life is passing away so very quickly? O father, tell me <span id="p6"><sup><small>[ p. 6 ]</small></sup></span> the course of duties that one should perform, without omitting to mention the fruits. Having listened to thee, I desire to observe those duties.’

“The sire said, ‘O son, observing the _Brahmacharya_ mode of life, one should first study the Vedas. He should then wish for children for rescuing his ancestors. Setting up his fire next, he should seek to perform the (prescribed) sacrifices according to due rites. At last, he should enter the forest for devoting himself to contemplation.’

“The son said, ‘When the world is thus surrounded on all sides and is thus assailed, and when such irresistible things of fatal consequences fall upon it, how can you say these words so calmly?’

“The sire said, How is the world assailed? What is that by which it is surrounded? What, again, are those irresistible things of fatal consequences that fall upon it? Why dost thou frighten me thus?’

“The son said, ‘Death is that by which the world is assailed. Decrepitude encompasses it. Those irresistible things that come and go away are the nights (that are continually lessening the period of human life). When I know that Death tarries for none (but approaches steadily towards every creature), how can I pass my time without covering myself with the garb of knowledge? [^14] When each succeeding night, passing away lessens the allotted period of one's existence, the man of wisdom should regard the day to be fruitless. (When death is approaching steadily) who is there that would, like a fish in a shallow water, feel happy? Death comes to a man before his desires have been gratified. Death snatches away a person when he is engaged in plucking flowers and when his heart is otherwise set, like a tigress bearing away a ram. Do thou, this very day, accomplish that which is for thy good. Let not this Death come to thee. Death drags its victims before their acts are accomplished. The acts of tomorrow should be done today, those of the afternoon in the forenoon. Death does not wait to see whether the acts of its victim have all been accomplished or not. Who knows that Death will not come to him even today? In prime of age one should betake oneself to the practice of virtue. Life is transitory. If virtue be practised, fame here and felicity hereafter will be the consequences. Overwhelmed by ignorance, one is ready to exert oneself for sons and wives. Achieving virtuous or vicious acts, one brings them up and aggrandises them. Like a tiger bearing away a sleeping deer, Death snatches away the man addicted to the gratification of desire and engaged in the enjoyment of sons and animals. Before he has been able to pluck the flowers upon which he has set his heart, before he has been gratified by the acquisition of the objects of his desire, Death bears him away like a tiger bearing away its prey. Death overpowers a man while the latter is stilt in the midst of the happiness that accrues from the gratification of desire, and while, still thinking, ‘This has been done; this is to be done; this has been half-done.’ Death bears away the man, however designated according to his <span id="p7"><sup><small>[ p. 7 ]</small></sup></span> profession, attached to his field, his shop, or his home, before he has obtained the fruit of his acts. Death bears away the weak, the strong, the brave, the timid, the idiotic, and the learned, before any of these obtains the fruits of his acts. When death, decrepitude, disease, and sorrow arising from diverse causes, are all residing in thy body, how is it that thou livest as if thou art perfectly hale? As soon as a creature is born, Decrepitude and Death pursue him for (effecting) his destruction. All existent things, mobile and immobile, are affected by these two. The attachment which one feels for dwelling in villages and towns (in the midst of fellowmen) is said to be the very mouth of Death. The forest, on the other hand, is regarded as the fold within which the senses may be penned. This is declared by the _Srutis_. [^15] The attachment a person feels for dwelling in a village or town (in the midst of men) is like a cord that binds him effectually. They that are good break that cord and attain to emancipation, while they that are wicked do not succeed in breaking them. He who never injures living creatures by thought, word, or deed, is never injured by such agencies as are destructive of life and property. [^16] Nothing can resist the messengers (Disease and Decrepitude) of Death when they advance except Truth which devours Untruth. In Truth is immortality. [^17] For these reasons one should practise the vow of Truth; one should devote oneself to a union with Truth; one should accept Truth for one's Veda; and restraining one's senses, one should vanquish the Destroyer by Truth. Both Immortality and Death are planted in the body. One comes to Death through ignorance and loss of judgment; while Immortality is achieved through Truth. I shall, therefore, abstain from injury and seek to achieve Truth, and transgressing the sway of desire and wrath, regard pleasure and pain with an equal eye, and attaining tranquillity, avoid Death like an immortal. Upon the advent of that season when the sun will progress towards the north, I shall restraining my senses, set to the performance of the _Santi_\-sacrifice, the _Brahma_\-sacrifice, the Mind-sacrifice, and the Work-sacrifice. [^18] How can one like me worship his Maker in animal-sacrifices involving cruelty, or sacrifices of the body, such as _Pisachas_ only can perform and such as produce fruits that are transitory? [^19] That person whose words, thoughts, <span id="p8"><sup><small>[ p. 8 ]</small></sup></span> penances, renunciation, and _yoga_ meditation, all rest on _Brahma_, succeeds in earning the highest good. There is no eye which is equal to (the eye of) Knowledge. There is no penance like (that involved in) Truth. There is no sorrow equal to (that involved in) attachment. There is no happiness (that which is obtainable from) renunciation. I have sprung from Brahma through _Brahma_. I shall devote myself to _Brahma_, though I am childless. I shall return to _Brahma_. I do not require a son for rescuing me. A Brahmana can have no wealth like to the state of being alone, the state in consequence of which he is capable of regarding everything with an equal eye, the practice of truthfulness, good behaviour, patience, abstention from injury, simplicity, and avoidance of all rites and visible sacrifices. What use hast thou, O Brahmana, of wealth or kinsmen and relatives, of wives, when thou shalt have to die? Seek thy Self which is concealed in a cave. Where are thy grandsires and where thy sire?' [^20]

“Bhishma continued, ‘Do thou also, O monarch, conduct thyself in that way in which the sire (in this story), conducts himself, devoted to the religion of Truth, after having listened to the speech of his son.’


## SECTION CLXXVI

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, whence and how happiness and misery come to those that are rich, as also those that are poor, but who live in the observance of different practices and rites.’ [^21]

“Bhishma continued, ‘In this connection is cited the old narrative of what was sung by Sampaka who had obtained tranquillity and achieved emancipation for himself. In former times a certain Brahmana, rendered miserable by a bad wife, bad dress, and hunger, and living in the observance of the vow of renunciation, told me these verses, [^22] 'Diverse kinds of sorrow and happiness overtake, from the day of birth the person that is born on the earth. If he could ascribe either of them to the action of Destiny, he would not then feel glad when happiness came or miserable when sorrow overtook <span id="p9"><sup><small>[ p. 9 ]</small></sup></span> him. Though thy mind is divested of desire, thou bearest yet a heavy load. Thou dost not seek to achieve thy good (_i.e._, emancipation). Art thou not successful in controlling thy mind? If thou goest about, having renounced home and desirable possessions, thou shalt taste real happiness. A person divested of everything sleepeth in happiness, and awaketh in happiness. Complete poverty, in this world, is happiness. It is a good regimen, it is the source of 'blessings, it is freedom from danger. This foeless path is unattainable (by persons cherishing desire) and is easily attainable (by those that are freed from desire). Casting my eyes on every part of the three worlds, I do not behold the person who is equal to a poor man of pure conduct and without attachment (to worldly things). I weighed poverty and sovereignty in a balance. Poverty weighed heavier than sovereignty and seemed to possess greater merits. Between poverty and sovereignty there is this great distinction, _viz_., that the sovereign, possessed of affluence, is always agitated by anxiety and seems to be within the very jaws of death. As regards, however, the poor man, who in consequence of the divestment of all wealth has freed himself from hopes and emancipated himself, neither fire, nor foe, nor death, nor robbers, can get the better of him. The very gods applaud such a man who wanders about according to his sweet will, who lies down on the bare ground with his arm for a pillow, and who is possessed of tranquillity. Affected by wrath and cupidity, the man of affluence is stained by a wicked heart. He casts oblique glances and makes dry speeches.—He becomes sinful, and his face is always darkened with frowns. Biting his lips, and excited with wrath, he utters harsh and cruel words. If such a man desires to even make a gift of the whole world, who is there that would like even to look at him? Constant companionship with Prosperity stupefies a person of weak judgment. It drives off his judgment like the wind driving off the autumnal clouds. Companionship with Prosperity induces him to think,—I am possessed of beauty! I am possessed of wealth! I am high-born! I meet with success in whatever I undertake! I am not an ordinary human being!—His heart becomes intoxicated in consequence of these three reasons. With heart deeply attached to worldly possessions, he wastes the wealth hoarded by his sires. Reduced to want, he then regards the appropriation of other people's wealth as blameless. At this stage, when he transgresses all barriers and beings to appropriate the possessions of others from every side, the rulers of men obstruct and afflict him like sportsmen afflicting with keen shafts a deer that is espied in the woods. Such a man is then overwhelmed with many other afflictions of a similar kind that originate in fire and weapons. Therefore, disregarding all worldly propensities (such as desire for children and wives) together with all fleeting unrealities (such as the body, etc.,) one should, aided by one's intelligence, apply proper medicine for the cure of those painful afflictions. Without Renunciation one can never attain to happiness. Without Renunciation one can never obtain what is for one's highest good. Without Renunciation one can never sleep at case. Therefore, renouncing everything, make happiness thy own. All this was said to me in past times at Hastinapur by a Brahmana about what Sampaka had <span id="p10"><sup><small>[ p. 10 ]</small></sup></span> sung. For this reason, I regard Renunciation to be the foremost of things.’”


## SECTION CLXXVII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘If any person, desiring to accomplish acts (of charity and sacrifices), fails to find (the necessary) wealth, and thirst of wealth overwhelms him, what is that which he must do for obtaining happiness?’

“Bhishma said, ‘He that regards everything (_viz_., joy and sorrow, honour and insult, etc.,) with an equal eye, that never exerts himself (for gratifying his desire for earthly possessions), that practises truthfulness of speech, that is freed from all kinds of attachment, and that has no desire for action, is, O Bharata, a happy man. These five, the ancients say, are the means for the acquisition of perfect tranquillity or emancipation. These are called Heaven. These are Religion. These constitute the highest happiness. In this connection is cited the old narrative of what Manki had sung, when freed from attachments, Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! Desirous of wealth, Manki found that he was repeatedly doomed to disappointments. At last with a little remnant of his property he purchased a couple of young bulls with a yoke for training them (to agricultural labour). One day the two bulls properly tied to the yoke, were taken out for training (in the fields). Shying at the sight of a camel that was lying down on the road, the animals suddenly ran towards the camel, and fell upon its neck. Enraged at finding the bulls fall upon its neck, the camel, endued with great speed, rose up and ran at a quick pace, bearing away the two helpless creatures dangling on either side of its neck. Beholding his two bulls thus borne away by that strong camel, and seeing that they were at the point of death, Manki began to say, ‘If wealth be not ordained by destiny, it can never be acquired by even a clever man exerting himself with attention and confidence and accomplishing with skill all that is necessary towards that end. I had, before this, endeavoured by diverse means and devotion to earn wealth. Behold this misfortune brought about by destiny to the property I had! My bulls are borne away, rising and falling, as the camel is running in an uneven course. This occurrence seems to be an accident. [^23] Alas, those dear bulls of mine are dangling on the camel's neck like a couple of gems! This is only the result of Destiny. Exertion is futile in what is due to Chance. Or, if the existence of anything like Exertion <span id="p11"><sup><small>[ p. 11 ]</small></sup></span> (as an agent in the production of results) be admitted, a deeper search would discover Destiny to be at the bottom. [^24] Hence, the person that desires happiness should renounce all attachment. The man without attachments, no longer cherishing any desire for earning wealth, can sleep happily. Ho, it was well said by Suka while going to the great forest from his father's abode, renouncing everything! [^25]\—Amongst these two, _viz_., one who obtains the fruition of all his wishes, and one who casts off every wish, the latter, who renounces all, is superior to the former who obtains the fruition of all. No one could ever attain to the end of desire. [^26] Only he that is destitute of knowledge and judgments feels an avidity for protecting his body and life.—Forbear from every desire for action. O my Soul that art possessed by cupidity, adopt tranquillity by freeing thyself from all attachments! Repeatedly hast thou been deceived (by desire and hope). How is it that thou dost not still free thyself from attachments? If I am not one that deserves destruction at thy hands, if I am one with whom thou shouldst sport in delight, then, O my wealth-coveting Soul, do not induce me towards cupidity. Thou hast repeatedly lost thy hoarded wealth. O my wealth-coveting and foolish Soul, when wilt thou succeed in emancipating thyself from the desire of wealth? Shame on my foolishness! I have become a toy of thine! It is thus that one becomes a slave of others. No one born on earth did ever attain to the end of desire, and to one that will take birth will succeed in attaining to it. Casting off all acts, I have at last been roused from sleep. I am now awake. Without doubt, O Desire, thy heart is as hard as adamant, since though affected by a hundred distresses, thou does not break into a hundred pieces! I know thee, O Desire, and all those things that are dear to thee! Seeking what is dear to thee, I shall feel happiness in my own Self. [^27] O Desire, I know thy root. Thou springest from Will. [^28]\—I shall, therefore, avoid Will. Thou shalt then be destroyed with thy roots. The desire for wealth can never be fraught with happiness. If acquired, great is the anxiety that the acquirer feels. If lost after acquisition, that is felt as death. Lastly, respecting acquisition itself, it is very uncertain. Wealth cannot be got by even the surrender of one's person. What can be more painful than this? When acquired, one is never gratified with its measure, but one continues to seek it. Like the sweet water of the Ganges, wealth only increases one's hankering. It is my destruction. I am now awakened. Do thou, <span id="p12"><sup><small>[ p. 12 ]</small></sup></span> O Desire, leave me! Let that Desire which has taken refuge in this my body,—this compound of (five) elements,—go whithersoever it chooses and live happily whithersoever it likes. [^29] Ye all that are not of the Soul, I have no joy in you, for ye follow the lead of Msire and Cupidity! Abandoning all of you I shall take refuge in the quality of Goodness. [^30] Beholding all creatures in my own body and my own mind, and devoting my reason to Yoga, my life to the instructions of the wise, and soul to Brahma, I shall happily rove through the world, without attachment and without calamities of any kinds, so that thou mayst not be able to plunge me again into such sorrows! [^31] If I continue to be agitated by thee, O Desire, I shall necessarily be without a path (by which to effect my deliverance). Thou, O Desire, art always the progenitor of thirst, of grief, and of fatigue and toil. I think the grief that one feels at the loss of wealth is very keen and far greater than what one feels under any other circumstances. Kinsmen and friends disregard him that has lost his wealth. With various kinds of humiliation that number by thousands, there are many faults in property that are more painful still. On the other hand, the very small happiness that resides in wealth is mingled with pain and sorrow. [^32] Robbers slay, in the sight of all, the person that is possessed of wealth, or afflict him with various kinds of severity, or always fill him with fear. At last, after a long time, I have understood that the desire for wealth is fraught with sorrow. Whatever the object, O Desire, upon which thou settest thy heart, thou forcest me to pursue it! Thou art without judgment. Thou art a fool. Thou art difficult of being contented. Thou canst not be gratified. Thou burnest like fire. Thou dost not enquire (in pursuing an object) whether it is easy or difficult of attainment. Thou canst not be filled to the brim, like the nether region. Thou wishest to plunge me into sorrow. From this day, O Desire, I am incapable of living with thee! I who had felt despair, at first, at the loss of my property, have now attained to the high state of perfect freedom from attachments. At this moment I no longer think of thee and thy train. I had, before this, felt great misery on thy account. I do not (now) regard myself as destitute of intelligence. Having adopted Renunciation in consequence of loss of my property, I can now rest, freed from every kind of fever. I cast thee off, O Desire, with all the passions of my heart. Thou shalt not again dwell with me or sport with me. I shall forgive them that will slander or <span id="p13"><sup><small>[ p. 13 ]</small></sup></span> speak ill of me. I shall not injure even when injured. If anybody from aversion speaks disagreeable words of me, disregarding those words I shall address him in agreeable speeches. In contentment of heart and with all my senses at case, I shall always live upon what may be got by me. I shall not contribute to the gratification of the wishes entertained by thee that art my foe. Freedom from attachment, emancipation from desire, contentment, tranquillity, truth, self-restraint, forgiveness, and universal compassion are the qualities that have now I come to me. Therefore, let Desire, cupidity, thirst, miserliness avoid me. I have now adopted the path of Goodness. Having cast off Desire and Cupidity, great is my happiness now. I shall no longer yield to the influence of Cupidity and no longer suffer misery like a person of uncleansed soul. One is sure to obtain happiness according to the measure of the desires he may be able to cast off. Truly, he who yields himself up to Desire always suffers misery. Whatever passions connected with Desire are cast off by a person, all appertain to the quality of Passion. Sorrow and shamelessness and discontent all arise from Desire and Wealth. Like a person plunging in the hot season into a cool lake, I have now entered into _Brahma_, I have abstained from work. I have freed myself from grief. Pure happiness has now come to me. The felicity that results from the gratification of Desire, or that other purer felicity which one enjoys in heaven, does not come to even a sixteenth part of that which arises upon the abandonment of all kinds of thirst! Killing the principle of desire, which with the body makes an aggregate of seven, and which is a bitter foe, I have entered the immortal city of _Brahma_ and shall pass my days there in happiness like a king!‘ Relying upon such intelligence, Manki freed himself from attachments, casting off all desires and attaining to Brahma that abode of the highest felicity. Indeed, in consequence of the loss of his two bulls Manki attained to immortality. Indeed, because he cut the very roots of desire, he attained, through that means, to high felicity.’”

“Bhishma continued, ‘In this connection is also cited the old narrative of the verses sung by Janaka the ruler of the Videhas, who had attained to tranquillity of soul. What the monarch said was, ‘Unlimited is my wealth. At the same time I have nothing, if the whole of (my kingdom) Mithila be consumed in a conflagration, I shall incur no loss.’ In the connection is also cited the speech of Vodhya uttered in respect of this very topic, _viz_., freedom from attachments. Listen to it O Yudhishthira! Once on a time the royal son of Nahusha (Yayati) questioned the _Rishi_ Vodhya who had, in consequence of the abandonment of desire, attained to tranquillity of soul and who had an intimate acquaintance with the scriptures. The monarch said, ‘O thou of great wisdom, give me instructions about tranquillity. What is that under <span id="p14"><sup><small>[ p. 14 ]</small></sup></span> standing relying upon which thou succeedest in wandering over the world in tranquillity of soul and disengaged from all acts?’

“Vodhya said, ‘I conduct myself according to the instructions of others but never instruct others myself. I shall, however, mention the indications of those instructions (according to which my conduct is framed). Thou mayst catch their spirit by reflection. My six preceptors are Pingala, the osprey, the snake, the bee in the forest, the maker of shafts (in the story), and the maiden (in the story)!’ [^33]

“Bhishma continued, ‘Hope is very powerful (in agitating the heart), O King! Freedom from hope is high felicity. Reducing hope to an absence of expectation, Pingala sleeps in peace. [^34] Beholding an osprey with meat in his beaks, others, that have not found any meat, assail and destroy him. A certain osprey, by altogether abstaining from meat obtained felicity. To build a house for one's own self is productive of sorrow and not of happiness. The snake, taking up his residence in another creature's abode, lives in felicity. The ascetics live happily, betaking themselves to mendicancy, without being injured by any creature, like bees in the forest. A certain maker of shafts, while employed at his work, was so deeply attentive to it that he did not notice the king who passed by his side. When many are together, dispute ensues. Even when two reside together, they are sure to converse. I, however, wander alone like the anklet made of sea-shells in the wrist of the maiden in the story.’” [^35]


## SECTION CLXXIX

“Yudhishthira said, ‘O thou that art conversant with the conduct of men, tell me by what conduct a person may succeed in this world, freed from grief. How also should a person act in this world so that he may attain to an excellent end?’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse between Prahlada and the sage Ajagara. Once on a time king Prahlada of great intelligence questioned a wandering Brahmana of great intelligence and a cleansed and tranquil soul.’

“Prahlada said, ‘Freed from desire, with a cleansed soul, possessed of humility and self-restraint, without desire of action, free from malice, agreeable <span id="p15"><sup><small>[ p. 15 ]</small></sup></span> in speech, endued with dignity and intelligence and wisdom, thou livest (in simplicity) like a child. Thou never covetest any kind of gain, and never grievest at any kind of loss. Thou art always contented, O Brahmana, and dost not seem to regard anything in the world. While all other creatures are being borne away in the current of desire and passion, thou art perfectly indifferent to all acts appertaining to Religion, Profit, and Pleasure. Thou seemest to be in a state of quietude (without the possibility of agitation). Disregarding all objects of the senses, thou movest like an emancipated self, only witnessing everything (but never taking part in anything). What, O sage, is thy wisdom, what thy learning, and what thy behaviour (in consequence of which all this becomes possible)? Tell me this without delay, if, O Brahmana, thou thinkest it will do me good!’

“Bhishma continued, ‘That intelligent Brahmana who was well-conversant with the duties of the world, thus questioned by Prahlada, answered him in sweet words of grave import. Behold, O Prahlada, the origin of creatures, their growth, decay, and death, are traceable to no (intelligible) cause. It is for this that I do not indulge in either joy or sorrow. [^36] All the propensities (for action) that exist in the universe may be seen to flow from the very natures of the creatures (to which they inhere). All things (in the universe) are depended on their respective natures. Hence, I am not delighted with anything. [^37] Behold, O Prahlada, all kinds of union have an aptitude for disunion. All acquisitions are certain to end in destruction. Hence I never set my heart upon the acquisition of any object. All things possessed of attributes are certain to meet with destruction. What remains there for a person then to do who (like me) is conversant with both the origin and the end of things? Of all things, large or small, born in the ocean of waters, the end is noticeable. I see also the death, which is manifest, O chief of _Asuras_, of all things, mobile and immobile, belonging to the land. O best of _Danavas_, death comes in season unto even the strongest of winged creatures which range the sky. I see again that the luminous bodies, large and small, which move in the firmament, fall down when their time comes. Beholding all created things Possessed of knowledge, to be thus liable to be affected by death, and thinking all things to be possessed of the same nature, I sleep in peace without any anxiety of heart. If I get without trouble a copious repast, I do not scruple to enjoy it. On the other hand, I pass many days, together without eating anything. Sometimes people feed me with costly viands in profusion, sometimes with a small quantity, sometimes with even less, and sometimes I get no food whatever. I sometimes eat only a portion of a grain; sometimes the <span id="p16"><sup><small>[ p. 16 ]</small></sup></span> dry sesame cakes from which the oil has been pressed out, I sometimes eat rice and other food of the richest kind. Sometimes I sleep on an elevated bedstead of the best kind. Sometimes I sleep on the bare ground. Sometimes my bed is made within a fine palace or mansion. I am sometimes clad in rags, sometimes in sackcloth, sometimes in raiments of fine texture, sometimes in deer-skins, sometimes in robes of the costliest kind. I never reject such enjoyments as are consistent with virtue and as are obtained by me without effort. I do not, at the same time, strive for attaining such objects as are difficult of acquisition. The rigid vow I have adopted is called Ajagara. [^38] That vow can secure immortality. It is auspicious and griefless. It is incomparable and pure. It is consistent with the counsels of the wise. It is disapproved by persons of foolish understanding who never follow it. With a pure heart I conduct myself according to it. My mind never swerves from this vow. I have not swerved from the practices of my order. I am abstemious in everything. I know the past and the present. Divested of fear and wrath and cupidity and errors of judgment, I follow this vow with a pure heart. There are no restrictions in respect of food and drink and other objects of enjoyment for one practising this vow. As everything is dependent on destiny, there is no observance of the considerations of time and place for one like us. The vow I follow contributes to true happiness of the heart. It is never observed by those that are wicked. I follow it with a pure heart. Induced by cupidity, men pursue different kinds of wealth. If baffled in the pursuit, they become depressed by sorrow. Reflecting properly upon all this by the aid of my intelligence which has penetrated the truths of things, I follow this vow with a pure heart. I have seen persons in distress seeking, for the acquisition of wealth, the shelter of men, good and bad. Devoted to tranquillity, and with my passions under control, I follow this vow with a pure heart. Beholding, by the aid of truth, that happiness and misery, loss and gain, attachment and renunciation, death and life, are all ordained by destiny, I follow this vow with a pure heart. Divested of fear and attachment and errors of judgment and pride, and endued with wisdom, intelligence, and understanding, and devoted to tranquillity and hearing that large snakes without moving enjoy the fruit that comes to them of itself, I follow their practice with a pure heart. Without restrictions of any kind in respect of bed and food, endued by my nature with self-restraint, abstemiousness, pure vow, truth, and purity of conduct, and without any desire to store (for future use) the rewards of action, I follow, with a delighted and pure heart, this vow. All causes of sorrow have fled from me in consequence of my having driven off the object of desire. Having received an accession of light, I follow this vow with a pure heart, for controlling my soul which is thirsty and unrestrained but which is capable (under proper culture) of depending upon itself (without the necessity of external objects to keep it engaged). Without paying any heed to the concerns towards <span id="p17"><sup><small>[ p. 17 ]</small></sup></span> which my heart, mind, words would like to lead me, and marking that the happiness which is connected with these is both difficult of acquisition and fleeting in respect of duration, I follow this vow with a pure heart. Learned men possessed of great intelligence, desirous of proclaiming their own feats, have while establishing their own theories and censuring those of others, said this and that on this topic which is incapable of being settled by disputation. Foolish men fail to understand this vow in a proper light. I, however, see it to be destructive of Ignorance. Regarding it also as fraught with immortality and as a remedy against diverse kinds of evil, I wander among men, having subdued all faults and having freed myself from thirst (after worldly goods)!’

“Bhishma continued, ‘That high-souled person who, having freed himself from attachments and divested himself of fear, cupidity; foolishness, and wrath, follows this Ajagara vow, or indulges in this sport, as it may be called, certainly succeeds in passing his days in great delight.’”


## SECTION CLXXX

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Which of these, O grandsire, _viz_., kinsmen, or acts, or wealth, or wisdom should be the refuge of a person? Questioned by me, answer me this!’

“Bhishma said, 'Wisdom is the refuge of creatures. Wisdom is regarded as the highest of acquisitions. Wisdom is the highest felicity in the world. Wisdom is heaven in the estimation of the good and virtuous. It was through wisdom that Vali, Prahlada, Namuchi, and Manki, when they lost their (earthly) prosperity, succeeded in acquiring felicity. What is there that is superior to wisdom? In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse between Indra and Kasyapa. Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! Once on a time a prosperous Vaisya, in the enjoyment of prosperity, and proud of his affluence, threw down, by negligently driving his car, a _Rishi's_ son of rigid vows named Kasyapa, devoted to penances. Prostrated on the ground, the young man, in exceeding pain, gave way to his wrath; and under the influence of despair resolved, saying, ‘I shall cast off my life. A poor man has no need of life in this world.’ While the Brahmana was lying in that state, silent and agitated, deprived of energy and at the point of death, Indra appeared on the scene in the form of a jackal and addressing him, said, 'All (inferior) creatures covet birth in the human race. Among men again, the status of a Brahmana is much desired. Thou, O Kasyapa, art a human being! Amongst human beings, thou art again a Brahmana. Among Brahmanas, thou art again one that is conversant with the Vedas. Having obtained that which is attainable with very great difficulty, it behoveth thee not to give up life from folly! All kinds Of (worldly) acquisitions are fraught with pride. The declaration of the _Srutis_ in that respect is perfectly true. Thou lookest the picture of contentment. <span id="p18"><sup><small>[ p. 18 ]</small></sup></span> In forming such a resolve (which is so derogatory of thy own self) about casting off thy life, thou actest from cupidity! O, they are crowned with success that have hands! I eagerly wish for the status of those creatures that have hands! We covet hands as eagerly as you covet riches. There is no acquisition that is more valuable than the acquisition of hands. Behold, O Brahmana, I cannot extract this thorn that has entered my body, or crush these insects and worms that are biting and afflicting me greatly! They that have bestowed upon them two hands with ten fingers, succeed in throwing away or crushing the worms (by scratching) that bite their limbs. They succeed in constructing shelters for themselves from rain, cold, and heat. They succeed also in enjoying excellent clothes for themselves, good food, comfortable beds, and excellent habitations. Lying on this Earth, they that have hands enjoy kine and other animals and cause them to carry burthens or drag their vehicles, and by the aid of diverse means bring those animals under sway (for their own purposes). Those living creatures that are without tongues, that are helpless, of little strength, and destitute of hands, bear all the several kinds of misery (indicated above). By good luck, O ascetic, thou art not like them. By good luck, thou art not a jackal, nor a worm, nor a mouse, nor a frog, nor an animal of any other miserable order. With this measure of gain (that thou hast won), thou shouldst, O Kasyapa, be contented! How happy, again, shouldst thou feel at the thought that amongst living creatures thou art a superior Brahmana! These worms are biting me! For want of hands I am unable to drive them off. Behold this my miserable plight! I do not cast off life because to do so is a very sinful act, and lest, indeed, I fall into a more miserable order of existence! This order of existence, _viz_., that of a jackal, to which I now belong is rather tolerable. Miserable as it is, there are many orders of existence below it that are more miserable still. By birth certain classes of creatures become happier than others who become subject to great woe. But I never see that there is any order of being which can be said to be in the possession of perfect happiness. Human beings, obtaining affluence, next wish for sovereignty. Having achieved sovereignty their next wish is for the status of gods. Having won that status they then wish for the chiefdom of the celestials. If thou becomest affluent, thou wilt never succeed in becoming a king (for thou art a Brahmana by birth), nor in becoming a god (because, in reality, thy status of Brahmanahood is equal if not superior to that of a god). If by any means (led away by the alluring prospect of heavenly bliss) thou becomest a god (instead of attaining to a superior position), thou wilt then covet for the chiefdom of the gods. In no condition wilt thou be contented. Contentment does not result from acquisition of desirable objects. Thirst is never slaked although there is profusion of water. [^39] The thirst for acquisition only blazes up with each fresh acquisition like a fire with new faggots thrown into it. In thee there is grief. But joy also dwells in thee. Both happiness and misery dwell in thee. Why then shouldst thou <span id="p19"><sup><small>[ p. 19 ]</small></sup></span> yield to grief? One should shut up, like birds in a cage, the very springs, _viz_., the understanding and the senses of, all one's desires and acts. There can be no cutting of a second head, nor of a third hand. That which does not exist can produce no fear. One that is not acquainted with the enjoyment a certain object affords, never feels a desire for that object. Desires arise from the actual experience of the pleasures that touch or sight, or hearing gives. Thou hast no idea of the taste of the wine called _Varuni_ or of the meat of the birds called _Ladwaka_. There is no drink and no food more delicious than these. Thou hast no idea also, O Kasyapa, of every other superior kind of drink and food that exists among men, for thou hast never tasted it. Without doubt, therefore, not to taste, not to see, should be the vow of a man if he is to win happiness. Creatures that have hands, without doubt, become strong and earn wealth. Men are reduced by men to a state of servitude, and are repeatedly afflicted (at the hands of their own species) with death, imprisonment, and other tortures. Although such is their condition, yet even they (without yielding to grief) laugh and sport and indulge in merriment. Others again, though endued with might of arms, and possessed of knowledge and great energy of mind, follow censurable, sinful, and miserable professions. They seek to change such professions for other pursuits (that are more dignified) but then they are bound by their own acts (of a previous life) and by the force of Destiny. The vilest man of the _Pukkasa_ or the _Chandala_ orders never wishes to cast off his life. He is quite contented with the order of his birth. Behold the illusion in this respect! Beholding those amongst thy species that are destitute of arms, or struck with palsy, or afflicted with other diseases, thou canst regard thyself as very happy and possessed of valuable accompaniments amongst the members of thy own order. If this thy regenerated body remains safe and sound, and free from disease, and all thy limbs remain perfect, thou art sure of never incurring any reproach amongst men. It would not behove thee, O Brahmana, to cast off thy life even if any blame, founded on fact and capable of bringing about thy dismissal from caste, attached to thee! Rise, and practise virtue. It is not meet that thou shouldst throw away thy life! If, O regenerate one, thou listen to me and place credence on my words, thou wilt then obtain the highest reward of the religion inculcated in the Vedas. Do thou set thyself to Vedic studies, and duly maintain thy sacred fire, and observe truth, and self-restraint, and charity. Never compare thyself boastfully with another. They who, by devoting themselves to the study of the Vedas, become competent for performing sacrifices for themselves and others, have no need to indulge in any kind of regret or fear any kind of evil. They that are born under an auspicious constellation on an auspicious lunation and at an auspicious hour, strive their best for performing sacrifices, practising charity, and procreating children, and desiring to pass their time cheerfully in those acts, at last win very great happiness. [^40] They, on the other hand, that are born <span id="p20"><sup><small>[ p. 20 ]</small></sup></span> under evil constellations, inauspicious lunations, and at evil hours, become destitute of sacrifices and progeny and at last fall into the _Asura_ order. [^41] In my former life I had much useless learning. I always sought for reasons and had very little faith. I was a slanderer of the Vedas. I was destitute of the (fourfold) objects of life, and was devoted to that science of argumentation which is based upon ocular or tangible proofs. [^42] I used to utter words based on (plausible) reasons. Indeed, in assemblies, I always spoke of reasons (and never faith). I used to speak irreverently of the declarations of the _Srutis_ and address Brahmanas in domineering tones. I was an unbeliever, skeptical of everything, and though really ignorant, proud of my learning. This status of a jackal that I have obtained in this life is the consequence, O regenerate one, of those sins of mine! If even after hundreds of days and nights I that am a jackal can once again obtain the status of humanity, I shall then pass my life in contentment, heedful of the true objects of existence, and engaged in sacrifices and gifts. I shall then know what should be known, and avoid what should be avoided!' Thus addressed, the ascetic Kasyapa, rising up, said, ‘O, thou art certainly possessed of knowledge and great intelligence! I am really surprised at all this!’ With eyes whose vision was extended by knowledge, the Brahmana then beheld that being who had addressed him to be Indra, chief of the gods and the lord of Sachi. Kasyapa then worshipped that god having the best of steeds for the animal that bore him. Receiving afterwards the god's permission, the Brahmana returned to his abode.'"

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, if gifts, sacrifices, penances, and dutiful services returned to preceptors, are productive of wisdom and high felicity.’ [^43]

‘Bhishma said, ‘If the mind becomes affected by desire, wrath and other evil passions, it then runs towards sin. If one's acts are stained by sin, one is obliged to dwell in painful regions. Sinful men take birth in indigent circumstances and repeatedly suffer the pangs of famine, woe, fear, and death. Those that are virtuous in their acts, and possessed of faith, and that have <span id="p21"><sup><small>[ p. 21 ]</small></sup></span> their senses under control, become born as affluent men and repeatedly sport in festivities and heaven and happiness. Unbelievers, with their arms manacled, are sent to regions rendered inaccessible by carnivorous beasts and elephants and full of terrors in consequence of snakes and robbers. What more need be said of them? They, on the other hand, who have reverence for gods and guests, who are liberal, who are fond of good and honest men, go, in consequence of their acts of charity, along that happy way which belongs to persons of cleansed souls. They that have no reverence for virtue are as vile among men as seedless grains among corn or the gnat among birds. That which is ordained in consequence of the acts of a past life pursues the actor even if the latter strives his best for leaving it behind. [^44] It sleeps when he sleeps and does whatever else he does. [^45] Like his shadow it rests when he rests, proceeds when he proceeds, and acts when he acts. Whatever acts a man does he has certainly to obtain the fruits thereof. Death is dragging all creatures who are surely destined to fall (into orders of existence they deserve) and who are surely 'liable to enjoy or suffer that which has been ordained as the consequence of their acts. The acts of a past life develop their consequences in their own proper time even as flowers and fruits, without extraneous efforts of any kind, never fail to appear when their proper time comes. After the consequences, as ordained, of the acts of a past life, have been exhausted (by enjoyment or sufferings), honour and disgrace, gain and loss, decay and growth, no longer flow or appear in respect of any one. This happens repeatedly. [^46] A creature while still in the mother's womb enjoys or suffers the happiness or the misery that has been ordained for him in consequence of his own acts. In childhood or youth or old age, at whatever period of life one does an act good or bad, the consequences thereof are sure to visit him in his next life at precisely the same period. As a calf recognises and approaches its parent in the midst of even a thousand kine, even so the acts of a past life recognise and visit the doer in his new life. Washed in water a (dirty) piece of cloth becomes clean. Similarly, men burning in repentance obtain endless happiness by proper penances. [^47] Those that can take up their residence in the woods and by performing austerities for a long period can wash themselves of their sins, succeed in obtaining the objects on which they set their hearts. As no one can mark the track of birds in the sky or of fishes in the water, similarly, the track of persons whose souls have been cleansed by knowledge <span id="p22"><sup><small>[ p. 22 ]</small></sup></span> cannot be marked by any. [^48] There is no need of any more eloquence or any more reference to sinful acts. Suffice it to say that one should, with proper judgment and as befits one best, do what is for one's good. This is the means by which wisdom and high felicity may be achieved.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Whence has this universe consisting of mobile and immobile creatures been created? Whom does it go to when destruction sets in? Tell me this, O grandsire! Indeed, by whom has this universe with its oceans, its firmament, its mountains, its clouds, its lands, its fire, and its wind, been created. How were all objects created? Whence this division into separate orders of existence? Whence are their purity and impurity, and the ordinances about virtue and vice? Of what kind is the life of living creatures? Where also do they go who die. Tell us everything about this and the other world.’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old narrative of the sacred words that Bhrigu said in reply to the questions of Bharadwaja. Beholding the great _Rishi_ Bhrigu blazing with energy and splendour, seated on the Kailasa summit, Bharadwaja addressed him in the following words.’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘By whom was this world with its ocean, its firmament, its mountains, its clouds, its lands, its fire, and its wind, created? How were all creatures first created? Whence this distinction of castes? Whence the purity and the impurity of (behaviour), and whence the ordinances about virtue and vice, for living creatures? Of what kind is the life of living creatures? Where do they go who die? It behoveth thee to tell me everything about this and the other world.’ Thus addressed about his doubts by Bharadwaja, the illustrious and regenerate _Rishi_ Bhrigu who resembled Brahma itself, replied unto him, saying these words.’

“Bhrigu said, 

“Bharadwaja said, ‘What is the extent of the firmament, of the points of the horizon, of the surface of this earth, and of the Wind? By telling me the truth, solve my doubts.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘The sky thou seest above is Infinite. It is the abode of persons crowned with ascetic success and of divine beings. It is delightful, and consists of various regions. Its limits cannot be ascertained. The Sun and the Moon cannot see, above or below, beyond the range of their own rays. There where the rays of the Sun and the Moon cannot reach are luminaries [^52] which are self-effulgent and which possess splendour like that of the Sun or the fire. Know this, O giver of honours, that possessed of far-famed splendour, even these last do not behold the limits of the firmament in consequence of the inaccessibility and infinity of those limits. This Space which the very gods cannot measure is fall of many blazing and self-luminous worlds each above the other. Beyond the limits of land are oceans of water. Beyond water is darkness. Beyond darkness is water again, and beyond the last is fire. Downwards, beyond the nether regions, is water. Beyond water is the region belonging to the great snakes. Beyond that is sky once more, and beyond the sky is water again. Even thus there is water and sky alternately without end. Even such are the limits of the Divinity represented by water. The very gods are unable to ascertain limits of fire and wind and <span id="p24"><sup><small>[ p. 24 ]</small></sup></span> water. The nature of fire, wind, water, and land, is like that of space. They are distinguished through want of true Knowledge. Sages read in diverse scriptures the limits that have been declared of the three worlds and the ocean. Who is there, however, that would set limits to what cannot be grasped by vision and what is inaccessible (in all its parts)? If even it becomes possible to ascertain the limits of the firmament which is the track of the gods and beings crowned with ascetic success, it can never be possible to set limits to that which is limitless and known by the name of the Infinite, to that which correspond with the name by which it is known, _viz_., what has been called the high-souled _Manasa_? When again His form is sometimes contracted and sometimes expanded, how can any one else except one that is equal to Him, be able to comprehend His limits? From the Lotus (of which I have already spoken) was first created the Omniscient lord, Brahman, endued with form, of essence comprised of Righteousness, and the Creator of all mobile and immobile things.

“Bharadwaja said, ‘If Brahman sprang from the Lotus, then it is the Lotus that should be regarded as the First-born and not Brahman. Why, however, is Brahma said to be the first? Do thou remove that doubt of mine.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘The Earth it is that is called the Lotus. It was created for giving a seat unto that form of Manasa which became Brahman. Reaching up to heaven itself, the Sumeru became the pericarp of the Lotus. Remaining within it, the puissant Lord of the Universe created all the worlds.’”


## SECTION CLXXXIII

“Bharadwaja said, ‘Tell me, O best of Brahmanas, how the puissant Brahman residing within Meru, created these diverse kinds of objects.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘The great Manasa (in his form of Brahman) created the diverse kinds of objects by fiat of Will. For the protection then of all creatures, he first created water. Water is the life of all creatures, and it is water which aids their growth. If there be no water, all creatures would perish. The whole universe is pervaded by water. Earth, mountains, clouds, and all things which have form, should all be known as transformations of water. They have all been produced by the solidification of that element.’

Bharadwaja said, ‘How did water spring? How Fire and Wind? How also was the earth created? I have great doubts on these points.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘O regenerate one, in very ancient times called the _Brahma-kalpa_, the high-souled _Rishis_ of the regenerate order, when they assembled together, felt this very doubt about the creation of the universe. Re-straining speech, they remained immovable, engaged in (ascetic) contemplation. Having given up all food, they subsisted upon air alone, and remained thus for a thousand celestial years. At the end of that period, certain words as <span id="p25"><sup><small>[ p. 25 ]</small></sup></span> sacred as those of the Vedas simultaneously reached the ears of all. Indeed, this celestial voice was heard in the firmament to say, ‘Formerly there was only infinite Space, perfectly motionless and immovable. Without sun, moon, stars, and wind, it seemed to be asleep. Then water sprang into existence like something darker within darkness. Then from the pressure of water arose wind. As an empty vessel without a hole appears at first to be without any sound, but when filled with water, air appears and makes a great noise, even so when infinite Space was filled with water, the wind arose with a great noise, penetrating through the water. [^53] That wind, thus generated by the pressure of the ocean of water, still moveth. Coming into (unobstructed) Space, its motion is never stopped. Then in consequence of the friction of wind and water, fire possessed of great might and blazing energy, sprang into existence, with flames directed upwards. That fire dispelled the darkness that had covered Space. Assisted by the wind, fire drew Space and Water together. Indeed, combining with the wind, fire became solidified. While failing from the sky, the liquid portion of fire solidified again and became what is known as the earth. The earth or land, in which everything is born, is the origin of all kinds of taste, of all kinds of scent, of all kinds of liquids, and of all kinds of animals.’”


## SECTION CLXXXIV

“Bharadwaja said, ‘When the high-souled Brahman has created thousands of creatures, why is it that only these five elements which he created first, which pervade all the universe and which are _great creatures_, have come to have the name of _creatures_ applied to them exclusively?’ [^54]

“Bhrigu said, ‘All things that belong to the category of the Infinite or the Vast receive the appellation of _Great_. It is for this reason that these five elements have come to be called Great creatures. Activity is wind. The sound that is heard is space. The heat that is within it is fire. The liquid juices occurring in it are water. The solidified matter, _viz_., flesh and bones, are earth. The bodies (of living creatures) are thus made of the five (primeval) elements. All mobile and immobile objects are made of these five elements. The five senses also of living creatures partake of the five elements. The ear partakes of the properties of space, the nose of earth; the tongue of water; touch of wind; and the eyes of light (of fire).’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘If all mobile and immobile objects be composed of these five elements, why is it that in all immobile objects those elements are <span id="p26"><sup><small>[ p. 26 ]</small></sup></span> not visible? Trees do not appear to have any heat. They do not seem to have any motion. They are again made up of dense particles. The five elements are not noticeable in them. Trees do not hear: they do not see; they are not capable of the perceptions of scent or taste. They have not also the perception of touch. How then can they be regarded as composed of the five (primeval) elements? It seems to me that in consequence of the absence of any liquid material in them, of any heat, of any earth, of any wind, and of any empty space, trees cannot be regarded as compounds of the five (primeval) elements.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘Without doubt, though possessed of density, trees have space within them. The putting forth of flowers and fruits is always taking place in them. They have heat within them in consequence of which leaf, bark, fruit, and flower, are seen to droop. They sicken and dry up. That shows they have perception of touch. Through sound of wind and fire and thunder, their fruits and flowers drop down. Sound is perceived through the ear. Trees have, therefore, ears and do hear. A creeper winds round a tree and goes about all its sides. A blind thing cannot find its way. For this reason it is evident that trees have vision. Then again trees recover vigour and put forth flowers in consequence of odours, good and bad, of the sacred perfume of diverse kinds of _dhupas_. It is plain that trees have scent. [^55] They drink water by their roots. They catch diseases of diverse kinds. Those diseases again are cured by different operations. From this it is evident that trees have perceptions of taste. As one can suck up water through a bent lotus-stalk, trees also, with the aid of the wind, drink through their roots. They are susceptible of pleasure and pain, and grow when cut or lopped off. From these circumstances I see that trees have life. They are not inanimate. Fire and wind cause the water thus sucked up to be digested. According, again, to the quantity of the water taken up, the tree advances in growth and becomes humid. In the bodies of all mobile things the five elements occur. In each the proportions are different. It is in consequence of these five elements that mobile objects can move their bodies. Skin, flesh, bones, marrow, and arteries and veins, that exist together in the body are made of earth. Energy, wrath, eyes, internal heat, and that other heat which digest the food that is taken, these five, constitute the fire that occurs in all embodied creatures. [^56] The ears, nostrils, mouth, heart, and stomach, these five, constitute the element of space that occurs in the bodies of living creatures. Phlegm, bile, sweat, fat, blood, are the five kinds of water that occur in mobile bodies. Through the breath called _Prana_ a living creature is enabled to move. Through that called _Vyana_, they put forth strength for action. That called _Apana_ moves downwards. That called _Samana_ resides within the heart. Through that called _Udana_ one eructates and is enabled to speak in consequence of its piercing through (the lungs, the throat, and the mouth). These are the five kinds of wind that cause an embodied creature to live and <span id="p27"><sup><small>[ p. 27 ]</small></sup></span> move. The properties of scent an embodied creature knows through the earth-element in him. From the water-element he perceives taste. From the fire-element represented by the eyes, he perceives forms, and from the wind-element he obtains the perception of touch. Scent, touch, taste, vision, and sound, are regarded as the (general) properties of every mobile and immobile object. I shall first speak of the several kinds of scent. They are agreeable, disagreeable, sweet, pungent, far-going, varied, dry, indifferent. All these nine kinds of scent are founded upon the earth-element. Light is seen by the eyes and touch through the wind-element. Sound, touch, vision and taste are the properties of water. I shall speak (in detail) now of the perception of taste. Listen to me. High-souled _Rishis_ have spoken of diverse kinds of taste. They are sweet, saltish, bitter, astringent, sour, and pungent. These are the six kinds of taste appertaining to the water-element. Light contributes to the vision of form. Form is of diverse kinds. Short, tall, thick, four-cornered, round, white, black, red, blue, yellow, reddish, hard, bright, smooth, oily, soft, and terrible. These are the sixteen different kinds of form which constitute the property of light or vision. The property of the wind-element is touch. Touch is of various kinds: warm, cold, agreeable.. disagreeable, indifferent, burning, mild, soft, light, and heavy. Both sound and touch are the two properties of the wind-element. These are the eleven properties that appertain to the wind. Space has only one property. It is called sound. I shall now tell thee the different kinds of sound. They are the seven original notes called _Shadja_, _Rishabha_, _Gandhara_, _Mahdhyama_, _Panchama_, _Dhaivata_ and _Nishada_. These are the seven kinds of the property that appertains to space. Sound inheres like the Supreme Being in all space though attached especially to drums and other instruments. Whatever sound is heard from drums small and large, and conchs, and clouds, and cars, and animate and inanimate creatures, are all included in these seven kinds of sound already enumerated. Thus sound, which is the property of space, is of various kinds. The learned have said sound to be born of space. When raised by the different kinds of touch, which is the property of the wind, it may be heard. It cannot however, be heard, when the different kinds of touch are inceptive. The elements, mingling with their counterparts in the body, increase and grow. Water, fire, wind are always awake in the bodies of living creatures. They are the roots of the body. Pervading the five life-breaths (already mentioned) they reside in the body.’”


## SECTION CLXXXV

“Bharadwaja said, ‘How does bodily fire or heat, entering the body, reside there? How also does the wind, obtaining space for itself, cause the body to move and exert itself?’

<span id="p28"><sup><small>[ p. 28 ]</small></sup></span>

“Bhrigu said, ‘I shall, O regenerate one, speak to thee of the course in which the wind moves, and how, O sinless one, that mighty element causes the bodies of living creatures to move and exert themselves. Heat resides within the head (brain) and protects the body (from perishing). The wind or breath called _Prana_, residing within the head and the heat that is there, cause all kinds of exertion. That _Prana_ is the living creature, the universal soul, the eternal Being, and the Mind, Intellect, and Consciousness of all living creatures, as also all the objects of the senses. [^57] Thus the living creature is, in every respect, caused by _Prana_ to move about and exert. Them in consequence of the other breath called _Samana_, every one of the senses is made to act as it does. The breath called _Apana_, having recourse to the heat that is in the urethra and the abdominal intestines, moves, engaged in carrying out urine and faeces. That single breath which operates in these three, is called _Udana_ by those that are conversant with science. That breath which operates, residing in all the joints of men's bodies, is called _Vyana_. There is heat in the bodies of living creatures which is circulated all over the system by the breath _Samana_. Residing thus in the body, that breath operates upon the different kinds of watery and other elementary substances and all bad humours. That heat, residing between _Apana_ and _Prana_, in the region of the navel, operates, with the aid of those two breaths, in digesting all food that is taken by a living creature. There is a duct beginning from the mouth down to the anal canal. Its extremity is called the anus. From this main duct numerous subsidiary ones branch out in the bodies of all living creatures. [^58] In consequence of the rush of the several breaths named above (through these ducts), those breaths mingle together. The heat (that dwells in _Prana_) is called _Ushman_. It is this heat that causes digestion in all creatures possessed of bodies. The breath called _Prana_, the bearer of a current of heat, descends (from the head) downwards to the extremity of the anal canal and thence is sent upwards once more. Coming back to its seat in the head, it once more sends down the heat it bears. Below the navel is the region of digested matter. Above it is that for the food which is taken. In the navel are all the forces of life that sustain the body. Urged by the ten kinds of breaths having _Prana_ for their first, the ducts (already mentioned), branching out from the heart, convey the liquid juices that food yields, upwards, downwards, and in transverse directions. [^59] The main duct leading from the mouth to the anus is the path by which _yogins_, vanquishers of fatigue, of perfect equanimity in joy and sorrow, and possessed of great patience, succeed in attaining to <span id="p29"><sup><small>[ p. 29 ]</small></sup></span> _Brahma_ by holding the soul within the brain. [^60] Even thus is heat panted in the breaths called _Prana_ and _Apana_ and others, of all embodied creatures. That heat is always burning there like a fire placed in any (visible) vessel.’


## SECTION CLXXXVI

“Bharadwaja said, ‘If it is the wind that keeps us alive, if it is the wind that causes us to move and exert, if it is the wind that causes us to breathe and to speak, then it seems that life is worth little. If the animal heat (that digests all food) be of the nature of fire, and if it is that fire which assists at digestion by dissolving the food we take, then life is worth little. When an animal dies, that which is called its life is never seen leaving it. Only the breath leaves it, and the internal heat becomes extinguished. If life were nothing else, than wind, or if life depended only on the wind, then it could have been seen like the external sea of air, and when passing out it would have mingled with that air. If life dependest upon air, and if it ended with the escape of that air from the body, it would then mingle with another portion of air (that exists externally) like a portion of water escaping into the great ocean and thereby only changing the place of its residence. If a quantity of water be thrown into a well, or if the flame of a lamp be thrown into a blazing fire, either of them, entering a homogeneous element, loses its independent or separate existence. If life were air, it also, when the animal died, would mingle with the great ocean of air outside. How can we say that there is life in this animal body which is made up of the five (primal) elements? If one of those elements disappear, the union of the other four becomes dissolved. The element of water drieth up if food be not taken. The element of air disappears if the breath be restrained. The element of space disappears if the excretions cease. So also the element of fire becomes extinguished if food does not go in. The element of earth breaks in pieces in consequence of diseases, wounds, and other sufferings. If only one of the five becomes afflicted, the union, being dissolved, the five go away into five different directions. When the body which is a union of the elements, becomes separated into five ingredients, whither doth life go? What doth it then know? What doth it then hear? What doth it then say? This cow (that is given away to a holy Brahmana), it is said, will rescue me in the other world. The animal, however, that is given away, itself dies. Whom then will this cow rescue? The taker of the cow (in gift) and the <span id="p30"><sup><small>[ p. 30 ]</small></sup></span> giver are both equal (in being both subject to death). Both of them meet with extinction in this world. How then will they meet again? How will the person that has been eaten up by birds, or that has been broken in pieces by a fall from a mountain summit, or that has been consumed by fire, regain life? The root of a tree that has been cut down does not grow up again. Only the seeds put forth sprouts. Where is the person who having died comes back (to some sort of new existence)? Only seeds were originally created. All this universe is the result of seeds in succession. They that die, die to perish Seeds result from seeds.’”


## SECTION CLXXXVII

“Bhrigu said, ‘There is no destruction of the living creature, or of what is given, or of our other acts. The creature that dies only goes into another form. The body along dissolves away. The living creature, though depending upon the body, does not meet with destruction when the body is destroyed. It is not seen after the destruction of the physical frame just as fire is not seen after the consumption of the fuel with which it was ignited.’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘If there is no destruction of the living creature like that of fire, I submit, fire itself is not seen after consumption of the fuel (that ignited it). When the supply of fuel is stopped, the fire becomes extinguished, and, as far as I know, becomes annihilated. That should surely be regarded to have met with destruction which has no longer any action, which furnishes no proof of its existence, and which no longer occupies any space.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘It is true that upon the consumption of fuel fire is no longer seen. It mingles with space because there is no longer any visible object in which to inhere, and hence it becomes incapable of perception by us. Similarly, upon leaving the body, the creature lives in space, and cannot be seen in consequence of its extreme subtility as is doubtless the case with fire. It is fire or heat that sustains the breaths called _Prana_ and the others. Know that that heat (thus existing) is called life or the living agent. That heat which is the sustainer of the breaths, becomes extinguished in consequence of the suppression of breath. Upon that heat in the physical frame being extinguished, the frame itself loses animation. Falling down, it is transformed into earth, for that is its ultimate destination. The breath that is in all mobile and immobile objects mingles with space, and the heat that is in them follows that breath. These three (_viz_., space, air, and tire), mingle together. The other two (_viz_., water and earth), exist together in the form of earth. There is wind where space is, and there is fire where wind is. They are formless, it should be known, and become endued with form only in respect of embodied creatures.’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘If in the physical frames of all living creatures there are heat, wind, earth, space and water, what, then, are the indications of <span id="p31"><sup><small>[ p. 31 ]</small></sup></span> living agent? Tell me these, O sinless one! I desire to know the nature of the life that is in the bodies of living beings,—bodies made up of the five primal elements, engaged in the five acts, endued with the five senses and possessed of animation. Upon the dissolution of the body which is a union of flesh and blood, and a mass of fat, sinews and bones, that which is the living agent cannot be seen. If this body, composed of the five elements, be destitute of what is called life, who or what then is that which feels misery upon the appearance of either bodily or mental pain? The living agent hears what is said, with the aid of the ears. It, however, happens again, O great _Rishi_, that the same agent hears not when the _Mind_ is otherwise engaged. It seems, therefore, that that which is called the living agent serves no purpose. The whole scene that the living agent sees with eyes acting in concert with the mind, the eye beholds not, even when lying before it, if the mind be otherwise engaged. Then again, when it is under the influence of sleep, that agent neither sees nor smells, nor hears, nor speaks, nor experiences the perceptions of touch and taste. Who or what then is that which feels joy, becomes angry, gives way to sorrow, and experiences tribulation? What is that which wishes, thinks, feels aversion, and utters words?’

“Bhrigu said, ‘The mind also is made of the five elements in common with the body. For this reason it is of no consequence with respect to the acts mentioned by thee. Only the one internal Soul sustaineth the body. It is he that perceives smell, taste, sound, touch and form and other properties (that exist in external nature). That Soul, pervading all the limbs, is the witness (of the acts) of the mind endued with five attributes and residing within the body composed of the five elements. It is he who feels pleasure and pain, and when separated from him the body no longer experiences them. When there is no longer any perception of form or of touch, when there is no heat in the fire that resides within the body,—indeed, when that animal heat becomes extinguished,—the body, in consequence of its abandonment by the Soul, meets with destruction. The whole universe is composed of water. Water is the form of all embodied creatures. In that water is the Soul which is displayed in the mind. That Soul is the Creator Brahman who exists in all things. When the Soul becomes endued with vulgar attributes, it comes to be called _Kshetrajna_. When freed from those attributes, it comes to be called _Paramatman_ or Supreme Soul. Know that Soul. He is inspired with universal benevolence. He resides in the body like a drop of water in a lotus. Know well that which is called _Kshetrajna_ and which has universal benevolence. Darkness, Passion, and Goodness are the attributes of the living agent. The learned say that the Soul has Consciousness and exists with the attributes of life. The soul exerts and causes everything to exert. Persons that have a knowledge of the Soul say that the Soul is different from life. It is the Supreme Soul that has created the seven worlds and sets them agoing. There is no destruction of the living agent when the dissolution of the body takes place. Men destitute of intelligence say that it dies. That is certainly untrue. All that the living agent does is to go from one unto another body. That which is called death is only the dissolution of the body. It is thus that the Soul, wrapped in diverse forms, <span id="p32"><sup><small>[ p. 32 ]</small></sup></span> migrates from form to form, unseen and unnoticed by others. Persons possessed of true Knowledge behold the Soul by their keen and subtile intelligence. The man of wisdom, living on frugal fare, and with heart cleansed of all sins, devoting himself to _yoga_ meditation, succeeds every night, before sleep and after sleep, in beholding his Soul by the aid of his Soul. [^61] In consequence of a contented heart, and by abandoning all acts good and bad, one can obtain infinite happiness by depending upon one's own Soul. The king, of fiery effulgence, residing within the mind is called the living agent. It is from that Lord of everything that this creation has sprung. Even this is the conclusion to be arrived at in the enquiry into the origin of creatures and the soul.’


## SECTION CLXXXVIII

“Bhrigu said, ‘Brahman first created a few Brahmanas who came to be called _Prajapatis_ (lords of creation). Possessed of splendour equal to that of the fire or the Sun, they were created out of the energy of that First-born Being. The puissant Lord then created Truth, Duty, Penance, the eternal Vedas, all kinds of pious acts, and Purity, for enabling creatures to attain to heaven (by practising them). After this, the Deities and the _Danavas_, the Gandharvas, the _Daityas_, the Asuras, the great snakes, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Serpents, the Pisachas, and human beings with their four divisions, _viz_., Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras, O best of regenerate ones, and all the other orders of creatures that exist, were created. The complexion the Brahmanas obtained was white; that which the Kshatriyas obtained was red; that which the Vaisyas got was yellow; and that which was given to the Sudras was black.’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘If the distinction between the four orders (of human beings) be made by means only of colour (attribute), then it seems that all the four orders have been mingled together. [^62] Lust, wrath, fear, cupidity, grief, anxiety, hunger, toil, possess and prevail over all men. How can men be distinguished by the possession of attributes? The bodies of all men emit sweat, urine, faeces, phlegm, bile, and blood. How then can men be distributed <span id="p33"><sup><small>[ p. 33 ]</small></sup></span> into classes? Of mobile objects the number is infinite; the species also of immobile objects are innumerable. How, then, can objects of such very great diversity be distributed into classes?’

“Bhrigu said, ‘There is really no distinction between the different orders. The whole world at first consisted of Brahmanas. Created (equal) by Brahman, men have, in consequence of their acts, become distributed into different orders. They that became fond of indulging in desire and enjoying pleasures, possessed of the attributes of severity and wrath, endued with courage, and unmindful of the duties of piety and worship,—these Brahmanas possessing the attribute of Passion,—became Kshatriyas. Those Brahmanas again who, without attending to the duties laid down for them, became possessed of both the attributes of Goodness and Passion, and took to the professions of cattle-rearing and agriculture, became Vaisyas. Those Brahmanas again that became fond of untruth and injuring other creatures, possessed of cupidity,—engaged in all kinds of acts for a living, and fallen away from purity of behaviour, and thus wedded to the attribute of Darkness, became Sudras. Separated by these occupations, Brahmanas, falling away from their own order, became members of the other three orders. All the four orders, therefore, have always the right to the performance of all pious duties and of sacrifices. Even thus were the four orders at first created equal by Brahman who ordained for all of them (the observances disclosed in) the words of _Brahma_ (in the Vedas). Through cupidity alone, many fell away, and became possessed by ignorance. The Brahmanas are always devoted to the scriptures on Brahma; and mindful of vows and restraints, are capable of grasping the conception of Brahma. Their penances therefore, never go for nothing. They amongst them are not Brahmanas that are incapable of understanding that every created thing is Supreme Brahma. These, falling away, became members of diverse (inferior) orders. Losing the light of knowledge, and betaking themselves to an unrestrained course of conduct, they take birth as _Pisachas_ and Rakshasas and Pretas and as individuals of diverse _Mleccha_ species. The great _Rishis_ who at the beginning sprang into life (through Brahman's Will) subsequently created, by means of their penances, men devoted to the duties ordained for them and attached to the rites laid down in the Eternal Vedas. That other Creation, however, which is eternal and undecaying, which is based upon _Brahma_ and has sprung from the Primeval God, and which has its refuge upon _yoga_, is a mental one.’” [^63]

<span id="p34"><sup><small>[ p. 34 ]</small></sup></span>


## SECTION CLXXXIX

“Bharadwaja said, ‘By what acts does one become a Brahmana? By what, a Kshatriya? O best of regenerate ones, by what acts again does one become a Vaisya or a Sudra? Tell me this, O foremost of speakers.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘That person is called a Brahmana who has been sanctified by such rites as those called _jata_ and others; who is pure in behaviour; who is engaged in studying the Vedas; who is devoted to the six well-known acts (of ablutions every morning and evening, silent recitation of _mantras_, pouring libations on the sacrificial fire, worshipping the deities, doing the duties of hospitality to guests, and offering food to the _Viswedevas_); who is properly observant of all pious acts; who never takes food without having offered it duly to gods and guests; who is filled with reverence for his preceptor; and who is always devoted to vows and truth. He is called a Brahmana in whom are truth, gifts, abstention from injury to others, compassion, shame, benevolence, [^64] and penance. He who is engaged in the profession of battle, who studies the Vedas, who makes gifts (to Brahmanas) and takes wealth (from those he protects) is called a Kshatriya. He who earns fame from keep of cattle, who is employed in agriculture and the means of acquiring wealth, who is pure in behaviour and attends to the study of the Vedas, is called a Vaisya. [^65] He who takes pleasure in eating every kind of food, who is engaged in doing every kind of work, who is impure in behaviour, who does not study the Vedas, and whose conduct is unclean, is said to be a Sudra. If these characteristics be observable in a Sudra, and if they be not found in a Brahmana, then such a Sudra is no Sudra, and, such a Brahmana is no Brahmana. By every means should cupidity and wrath be restrained. This as also self-restraint, are the highest results of Knowledge. Those two passions (_viz_., cupidity and wrath), should, with one's whole heart, be resisted. They make their appearance for destroying one's highest good. One should always protect one's prosperity from one's wrath, one's penances from pride; one's knowledge from honour and disgrace; and one's soul from error. That intelligent person, O regenerate one, who does all acts without desire of fruit, whose whole wealth exists for charity, and who performs the daily _Homa_, is a real Renouncer. [^66] One should conduct oneself as a friend to all creatures, abstaining from all acts of injury. Rejecting the acceptance of all gifts, one <span id="p35"><sup><small>[ p. 35 ]</small></sup></span> should, by the aid of one's own intelligence, be a complete master of one's passions. One should live in one's soul where there can be no grief. One would then have no fear here and attain to a fearless region hereafter. One should live always devoted to penances, and with all passions completely restrained; observing the vow of taciturnity, and with soul concentrated on itself; desirous of conquering the unconquered senses, and unattached in the midst of attachments. All things that can be perceived by the senses are called Manifest. All, however, that is Unmanifest, that is beyond the ken of the senses, that can be ascertained only by the subtile senses, should be sought to be known. [^67] If there be no faith, one will never succeed in attaining to that subtile sense. Therefore, one should hold oneself in faith. The mind should be united with _Prana_, and _Prana_ should then be held within Brahma. By dissociating oneself from all attachments, one may obtain absorption into Brahma. There is no need of attending to any other thing. A Brahmana can easily attain to Brahma by the path of Renunciation. The indications of a Brahmana are purity, good behaviour and compassion unto all creatures.’”


## SECTION CXC

“Bhrigu said, ‘Truth is Brahma; Truth is Penance; it is Truth that creates all creatures. It is by Truth that the whole universe is upheld; and it is with the aid of Truth that one goes to heaven. Untruth is only another form of Darkness. It is Darkness that leads downwards. Those who are afflicted by Darkness and covered by it fail to behold the lighted regions of heaven. It has been said that Heaven is Light and that Hell is Darkness. The creatures that dwell in the universe may obtain both heaven and hell. In this world also, truth and untruth lead to opposite courses of conduct and opposite indications, such as Righteousness and Unrighteousness, light and darkness, pleasure and pain. Amongst these, that which is Truth is Righteousness; that which is Righteousness is Light; and that which is Light is Happiness. Similarly, that which is Untruth is Unrighteousness; that which is Unrighteousness is Darkness; and that which is Darkness is Sorrow or Misery. In this respect it is said that they that are possessed of wisdom, beholding that the world of lire is overwhelmed with sorrow, both bodily and mental, and with happiness that is sure to end in misery, never suffer themselves to be stupefied. He that is Wise will strive to rescue himself from sorrow. The happiness of living <span id="p36"><sup><small>[ p. 36 ]</small></sup></span> creatures is unstable both here and hereafter. [^68] The happiness of creatures that are overwhelmed by Darkness disappears like the splendour of the Moon when afflicted by Rahu. [^69] Happiness is said to be of two kinds, _viz_., bodily and mental. Both in this and the other world, the visible and the invisible fruits (of action) are specified (in the Vedas) for the sake of happiness. [^70] There is nothing more important than happiness and among the fruits or consequences of the triple aggregate. Happiness is desirable. It is an attribute of the Soul. Both Virtue and Profit are sought for its sake. Virtue is its root. This, indeed, is its origin. All acts have for their end the attainment of happiness.’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘You have said that happiness is the highest object, I do not comprehend this. This attribute of the soul that (you say) is so desirable is not sought by the _Rishis_ who are regarded to be engaged in something promising a higher reward. It is heard that the Creator of the three worlds, _viz_., the puissant Brahman, lives alone, observant of the vow of _Brahmacharya_. He never devotes himself to the happiness obtainable from the gratification of desire. Also, the divine Master of the universe, the lord of Uma, reduced _Kama_ (the deity of desire) to extinction. For this reason, we say that happiness is not acceptable to high-souled people. Nor does it appear to be a high attribute of the Soul. I cannot put faith in what thy divine self has said, _viz_., that there is nothing higher than happiness. That there are two kinds of consequences in respect of our acts, _viz_., the springing of happiness from good acts and of sorrow from sinful, acts, is only a saying that is current in the world.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘On this it is said as follows: from Untruth springs Darkness. They that are overwhelmed by Darkness pursue only Unrighteousness and not Righteousness, being overmastered by wrath, covetousness, malice, falsehood, and similar evils. They never obtain happiness either here or hereafter, On the other hand, they are afflicted by various kinds of disease and pain and trouble. They are also tortured by Death, imprisonment, and diverse other griefs of that kind, and by the sorrows, attending on hunger and thirst and toil. They are also pained by the numerous bodily griefs that arise from rain and wind and burning heat and exceeding cold. They are also overwhelmed by numerous mental griefs caused by loss of wealth and separation from friends, as also by griefs caused by decrepitude and death. They that are not touched by these diverse kinds of physical and mental afflictions, know what happiness is. These evils are never found in heaven. There delicious breezes blow. In heaven there is also perpetual fragrance. In heaven there is no hunger, no thirst, no decrepitude, no sin. In this world there is both happiness and misery. In hell there is only misery. Therefore, <span id="p37"><sup><small>[ p. 37 ]</small></sup></span> happiness is the highest object of acquisition. The Earth is the progenitrix of all creatures. Females partake of her nature. The male animal is like Prajapati himself. The vital seed, it should be known, is the creative energy. In this way did Brahman ordain in days of old that the creation should go on. Each, affected by his own acts, obtains happiness or misery.’” [^71]


## SECTION CXCI

“Bharadwaja said, ‘What has been said to be the consequence of gift? What of Righteousness? What of conduct? What of Penances well-performed? What of the study and recitation of the Vedas? And what of pouring libations upon the fire?’

‘Bhrigu said, ‘By pouring libations on the sacred fire, sin is burnt. By study of the Vedas one obtains blessed tranquillity. By gift, one obtains pleasure and articles of enjoyment. By Penances, one acquires blessed heaven. Gift is said to be of two kinds: gifts for the other world, and those for this. Whatever is given to the good attends the giver in the other world. Whatever is given to those that are not good produces consequences enjoyable here. The consequences of gifts are commensurate with the gifts themselves.’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘What course of duties should be performed by whom? What also are the characteristics of duty? How many kinds of duty are there? It behoveth thee to tell me these.’ [^72]

“Bhrigu said, ‘Those wise men who are engaged in practising the duties laid down for them succeed in obtaining heaven as their reward. By doing otherwise people become guilty of folly.’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘It behoveth thee to tell me about the four modes of life that were formerly laid down by Brahman, and the practices ordained for each of them.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘In days of yore, the divine Brahman, for benefiting the world, and for the protection of righteousness, indicated four modes of life. [^73] Amongst them, residence in the abode of the preceptor is mentioned as the first (in order of time). He who is in this mode of life should have his soul cleansed by purity of conduct, by Vedic rites, and by restraints and vows and humility. He should worship the morning and evening twilights, the Sun, his own sacred fire, and the deities. He should cast off procrastination and idleness. He should cleanse his soul by saluting his preceptor, by studying the Vedas, and by listening to his preceptor's instructions. He should perform <span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span> his ablutions thrice (_viz_., in the morning, noon, and evening). He should lead a life of celibacy; attend to his sacred fire; dutifully serve his preceptor; daily go out on a round of mendicancy (for supporting himself); and give ungrudgingly unto his preceptor the whole of what is obtained in alms. Willingly accomplishing everything that the commands of his preceptor may indicate, he should be ready to receive such Vedic instruction as his preceptor may give him as a favour. [^74] On this subject there is a verse: That Brahmana who obtains his Veda by attending with reverence upon his preceptor, succeeds in attaining to heaven and obtains the fruition of all his desires. The domestic mode of life is called the second (in point of time). We shall explain to you all the pious acts and indications of that mode. Those who having completed their residence in the preceptor's abode return home, who are of pious conduct, who desire the fruits of a virtuous course of behaviour with spouses in their company, have this mode of life ordained for them. In it Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure, may all be obtained. It is (thus) suited to the cultivation of the triple aggregate. Acquiring wealth by irreproachable acts, or with wealth of high efficacy which is obtained from recitation of the Vedas, or living upon such means as are utilised by the regenerate _Rishis_, [^75] or with the produce of mountains and mines, or with the wealth represented by the offerings made in sacrifices and on the termination of vows and other observances, and those made unto deities, the householder should lead this mode of life. That mode of life is regarded as the root of all the others. They who are residents in the abodes of preceptors, they who lead lives of mendicancy, and others who live in the observance of vows and restraints to which they are pledged, derive from this mode the means they live upon, the offerings they make unto the _Pitris_ and the deities, and, in short, their entire support. The third mode of life is called the Forest-life. For those that lead it, there is no storing of wealth and articles. [^76] Generally, these pious and good men, subsisting upon good food, and engaged in studying the Vedas, roam ever the earth for journeying to tirthas and visiting diverse realms. Standing up, advancing forward, sweet speeches uttered in sincerity, gifts according to the measure of the giver's competence, offer of seats and beds of the best kind, and presents of excellent food, are some of the means for showing them regard. <span id="p39"><sup><small>[ p. 39 ]</small></sup></span> On this subject there is a verse: If a guest turns away from a house with expectations unfulfilled, he is supposed to take away the merits of the householder and leave the latter all his misdeeds. Then again in the domestic mode of life the deities are gratified by sacrifices and other religious rites; the _Pitris_ by the performance of obsequial rites; the _Rishis_ by cultivation of (Vedic) knowledge, by listening to the instructions of preceptors, and by committing to memory the scriptures; and lastly the Creator by begetting children. [^77] On this subject there are two verses: One in the observance of this mode of life should speak upon all creatures words breathing affection and agreeable to the ears. To give pain, to inflict mortifications, and harsh words, are all censurable. Insult, arrogance, and deceit, also should be avoided. Abstention from injury, truth, and absence of wrath, produce the merit of penances in all the (four) modes of life. In the domestic mode of life these are allowed, _viz_., the use and enjoyment of floral garlands, ornaments, robes, perfumed oils and unguents; enjoyment of pleasures derived from dancing and music, both vocal and instrumental, and all sights and scenes that are agreeable to the sight; the enjoyment of various kinds of viands and drinks belonging to the principal orders of edibles, _viz_., those that are swallowed, those that are lapped, those that are quaffed, and those that are sucked; and the enjoyment of pleasures derivable from sports and every kind of amusement and the gratification of desires. That man who in the observance of this mode of life seeks the acquisition of the triple aggregate (_viz_., Religion, Wealth, and Pleasure), with that of the great end of the three attributes of Goodness and Passion and Darkness, [^78] enjoys great happiness here and at last attains to the end that is reserved for persons that are virtuous and good. [^79] Even that householder who observes the duties of his mode of life by following the practice of picking up fallen grains of corn from the cracks of fields and who abandons sensual pleasure and attachment to action, does not find it difficult to obtain heaven.’”


## SECTION CXCII

“Bhrigu said, ‘Forest recluses seeking the acquisition of virtue go to sacred waters and rivers and springs, and undergo penances in lone and secluded woods abounding with deer and buffaloes and boars and tigers and wild <span id="p40"><sup><small>[ p. 40 ]</small></sup></span> elephants. They forsake all kinds of robes and food and enjoyments for which people living in society have a taste. They subsist abstemiously upon wild herbs and fruits and roots and leaves of diverse kinds. The bare ground is their seat. They lie down on the bare earth or rocks or pebbles or gravel or sand or ashes. They cover their limbs with grass and animal skins and barks of trees. They never shave their heads and beards or pare their nails. They perform their ablutions at regular intervals. They pour libations on the ground, as also on the sacred fire at the proper time without fail. They never enjoy any rest till completion of their daily gathering of the sacred fuel (for their _homa_ fires) and sacred grass and flowers (for sacrifice and worship) and till they have swept and rubbed clean (their sacrificial altars). They bear without the least regard cold and heat, and rain and wind, and, therefore, the skin of their bodies is cracked all over; and in consequence of observing and laying down for themselves various kinds of rites and vows and acts, their flesh and blood and skin and bones become emaciated. [^80] Endued with great patience and fortitude, they live, always practising the quality of goodness. That person who, with restrained soul, observes such a course of duties originally ordained by regenerate _Rishis_, burns all his sins like fire and obtains regions of felicity difficult of attainment.’

“I shall now describe the conduct of those called _Parivrajakas_. That is as follows: freeing themselves from attachment to the sacred fire, wealth, spouse and children, and robes, seats, beds, and such other objects of enjoyment, and breaking the bonds of affection, they roam about, regarding with an equal eye a clump of earth or rock and gold. They never set their hearts on the acquisition or enjoyment of the triple aggregate. They cast an equal eye on foes and friends and neutrals or strangers. They never injure, in thought, word, or deed, immobile things or creatures that are viviparous, or oviparous or born of filth, or called vegetables. They have no homes. They roam over hills and mountains, upon shores of rivers or seas, under shades of trees, and among temples of deities. They may go to towns or villages for residence. In a town, however, they should not live for more than five nights, while in a village their residence should never exceed one night. Entering a town or a village, they should, for the support of life, repair to the abodes of only Brahmanas of liberal deeds. [^81] They should never ask for any alms except what is thrown into the (wooden) bowls they carry. They should free themselves from lust, wrath, pride, cupidity, delusion, miserliness, deceit, slander, vanity, and injury to living creatures. On this subject there are some verses: that person, who, observing the vow of taciturnity, roveth without giving any creature cause of fear, is never inspired with any fear himself by any <span id="p41"><sup><small>[ p. 41 ]</small></sup></span> creature. That learned person who performs the _Agnihotra_ (not by kindling of, external fire but) with the aid of the fire that is his own body, indeed, who poureth libations into his own mouth and upon the fire that exists in his own body, succeeds in attaining to numerous regions of felicity in consequence of that fire being fed with such libations obtained by a life of eleemosynation. That person of regenerate birth who observes in the aforesaid way this mode of life having Emancipation for its end, with a pure heart and with an understanding freed from resolution, attains to _Brahma_ after the manner of a tranquil ray of light that is not fed by any blazing fuel.’

“Bharadwaja said, ‘Beyond this region (that we inhabit) there is a region that we have heard of but never seen. I desire to know all about it. It behoveth thee to describe it to me.’

“Bhrigu said, ‘Towards the north, on the other side of Himavat, which is sacred and possessed of every merit, there is a region that is sacred, blessed, and highly desirable. That is called the other world. [^82] The men that inhabit that region are righteous in act, pious, of pure hearts, freed from cupidity and errors of judgment, and not subject to afflictions of any kind. That region is, indeed, equal to heaven, possessed as it is of such excellent attributes. Death comes there at the proper season. Diseases never touch the inhabitants. [^83] Nobody cherishes any desire for the wives of other people. Every one is devoted to his own wife. These people do not afflict or kill one another, or covet one another's things. There no sin occurs, no doubt arises. [^84] There the fruits of all (religious) acts are visible. There some enjoy seats and drinks and viands of the best kind, and live within palaces and mansions. There some, adorned with ornaments of gold, surround themselves with every article of enjoyment. There are, again, some that eat very abstemiously, for only keeping body and soul together. There some, with great toil, seek to hold the life-breaths. [^85] Here (in this region that is inhabited by us), some men are devoted to righteousness and some to deceit. Some are happy and some miserable; some are poor and some rich. Here toil, and fear and delusion, and painful hunger make their appearance. Here cupidity for wealth is also seen, a passion that stupefies even those that are learned amongst men. Here diverse opinions prevail, broached by those that do deeds which are righteous or sinful. That man possessed of wisdom who knows all those opinions which may be divided into two kinds, is never stained by sin. Deceit With fraud, theft, slander, malice, oppression, injury, treachery, and untruth, <span id="p42"><sup><small>[ p. 42 ]</small></sup></span> and vices that detract from the merit of his penances who practises them. He, on the other hand, possessed of learning, who avoids them, finds the merit of his penances increased. Here there is much reflection about acts that are righteous and those that are unrighteous. This region that we inhabit is the field of action. Having done good and evil here, one obtains good for his good acts and evil for acts that are evil. [^86] Here the very Creator in days of yore, and all the gods with the _Rishis_, having performed proper penances, become cleansed and attain to _Brahma_. [^87] The northern portion of the earth is highly auspicious and sacred. Those belonging to this region (that we inhabit) that are doers of righteous deeds or that show regard for _yoga_, become born in that region. Others (that are of a different disposition) take their births in the intermediate species. Some again, when their allotted periods run out, become lost on earth. [^88] Employed in feeding upon one another and stained by cupidity and delusion, these mea return to this very region without being able to go (after death) to that northern region. Those men of wisdom who with vows and observant of _Brahmacharyya_ listen with veneration to the instructions of preceptors, succeed in knowing the ends reserved for all classes of men. I have now told thee in brief the course of duties ordained by Brahman. He, indeed, is said to be possessed of intelligence who knows what is righteousness and what its reverse in this world.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus, O king, did Bhrigu speak unto Bharadwaja of great energy. Of soul highly virtuous, the latter became filled with wonder and worshipped the great sage with veneration. Thus, O monarch, the origin of the universe has been narrated to thee in detail. What, O thou of great wisdom, dost thou wish to hear after this?”’


## SECTION CXCIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘I think, O grandsire, that thou art acquainted with everything, O thou that art conversant with duties. I desire to hear thee discourse to me, O sinless one, of the ordinances about conduct.’

<span id="p43"><sup><small>[ p. 43 ]</small></sup></span>

“Bhishma said, ‘They that are of bad conduct, of bad acts, of wicked understanding, and excessive rashness, are called evil or wicked men. They, however, that are called good are distinguished by purity of conduct and practices. They are good men who never answer calls of nature on the high roads, in cow-pens, or in fields overgrown with paddy. Having finished the necessary acts one should perform his ablutions in river-water and gratify the deities with oblations of water. This is said to be the duty of all men. Surya should be always worshipped. One should not sleep after sunrise. Morning and evening the prayers (ordained in the scriptures) should be said, sitting with face turned towards the east and towards the west respectively. Washing the five limbs, [^89] one should eat silently with face turned towards the east. One should never disparage the food which one is to eat. One should eat food that is good to the taste. After eating one should wash one's hands and rise. [^90] One should never go to sleep at night with wet feet. The celestial _Rishi_ Narada said that these are indications of good conduct. One should every day circumambulate a sacred spot, a bull, a sacred image, a cow-pen, a place where four roads meet, a pious Brahmana, and sacred tree. One should not make distinctions between one's guests and attendants and kinsmen in matters of food. Equality (in this respect) with servants is applauded. Eating (twice a day) in the morning and evening is an ordinance of the gods. It is not laid down that one should eat (once more) at any intermediate period. He who eats according to this rule acquires the merit of a fast. [^91] At the hours ordained for _Homa_ one should pour libations on the sacred fire. Without seeking the companionship of other people's wives, the man of wisdom who seeks his own wife in her season acquires the merit of _Brahmacharyya_. The remnants of a Brahmana's dish are like ambrosia. They are like the lacteal sustenance that is yielded by the mother's breast. People highly prize those remnants. The good, by eating them attain to Brahma. He who pounds turf to clay (for making sacrificial altars), or he who cuts grass (for making sacrificial fuel), or he who uses his nails only (and not weapons of any kind) for eating (sanctified meat), or he who always subsists on the remnants of Brahmana's dishes, or he who acts, induced by desire for reward, has not to live long in the world. [^92] One who has abstained from meat (under any vow) should not take meat even if it be sanctified with _mantras_ from the _Yajurveda_. One should also avoid the flesh about the vertebral <span id="p44"><sup><small>[ p. 44 ]</small></sup></span> column (of any animal) and the flesh of animals not slain in sacrifices. [^93] Whether at one's own place or in a strange land, one should never cause one's guest to fast. Having obtained alms and other fruits of optional acts, one should offer them to one's seniors. One should offer seats to one's seniors and salute them with respect. By worshipping one's seniors, one obtains long life, fame, and prosperity. One should never behold the Sun at the moment of rising, nor should one turn one's gaze towards a naked woman that is another man's spouse. Congress with one's wife (in her season) is not sinful but it is an act that should always be done in privacy. The heart of all sacred spots and shrines is the Preceptor. The heart of all pure and cleansing things is Fire. All acts done by a good and pious person are good and laudable, including even the touching of the hair of a cow's tail. Every time one meets with another, one should make polite enquiries. The saluting of Brahmanas every morning and evening is ordained. In temples of gods, amid cows, in performing the rites of religion laid down for Brahmanas, in reading the Vedas, and in eating, the right hand should be raised. [^94] The worship of Brahmanas, morning and evening, according to due rites, produces great merit. In consequence of such worship the stock-in-trade of the merchant, become abundant and the produce of the agriculturist. Great also becomes the yield of all kinds of corn and the supply of all articles that the senses can enjoy becomes copious. When giving eatables to another (seated at his dish), one should say, ‘_Is it sufficient_?’ When presenting drink, one should ask, ‘_Will it gratify_,’ and when giving sweetened milk and rice, or sugared gruel of barley, or milk with sesame or pease, one should ask ‘_Has it fallen_?’ [^95] After shaving, after spitting, after bathing, and after eating, people should worship Brahmanas with reverence, Such worship is sure to bestow longevity on sickly men. One should not pass urine with face turned towards the sun, nor should one see one's own excreta. One should not lie on the same bed with a woman, nor eat with her. In addressing seniors one should never apply the pronoun you to them or take their names. Thouing or the taking of names is not censurable in addressing inferiors or equals in age. [^96] The hearts of sinful men betray the sins committed by them. Those sinful men that conceal their conscious sins from good men meet with destruction. Only ignorant fools seek to conceal the sins which they commit consciously. It is true that human beings do not see those sins but the gods see them. A sin concealed by another sin leads to fresh sins. An act of merit, again, if concealed by an act of merit, increases the merit. The acts of a <span id="p45"><sup><small>[ p. 45 ]</small></sup></span> virtuous man always follow in the wake of virtue. A man destitute of understanding never thinks of the sins committed by him. Those sins, however, overtake the doer that has fallen away from the scriptures. As Rahu comes to Chandra (at his proper time), those sinful acts come to the foolish man. [^97] The objects that are stored with expectation are scarcely enjoyed. Such storing is never applauded by the wise, for death waits for no one (but snatches his prey whether the latter be ready or unready). The wise have said that the righteousness of all creatures is an attribute of the mind. For this reason, one should, in one's mind, do good to all. [^98] One should practise virtue singly. In the practice of virtue one has no need for the help of others. If one obtains only the ordinances of the scriptures, what can an associate do? [^99] Righteousness is the origin of mankind. Righteousness is the ambrosia of the gods. After death, men enjoy, through Righteousness, eternal happiness.’

## SECTION CXCIV

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, what and of what nature is that which is called by the name of _Adhyatma_ and which is laid down for every person. [^100] O thou that art acquainted with Brahma, whence has this universe consisting of mobile and immobile things, been created? When universal destruction sets in, to whom does it go? It behoveth thee to discourse to me upon this topic.’ [^101]

“Bhishma said ‘This, _Adhyatma_, O son of Pritha, that thou askest me about, I will presently discourse upon. It is highly agreeable and productive of great felicity. Great teachers have (before this) show the truths about Creation and the Destruction (of the universe). Knowing those truths, a person may <span id="p46"><sup><small>[ p. 46 ]</small></sup></span> obtain, even in this world, great satisfaction and felicity. Such knowledge may lead also to the acquisition of great fruits, and it is highly beneficial to all creatures. Earth, air, space, water, and light numbered as the fifth, are regarded as Great Creatures. These constitute both the origin and the destruction of all created objects. Unto him from whom these great primal elements take their origin, they return repeatedly, severing themselves from all creatures (into whose compositions they enter), even like the waves of the ocean (subsiding into that from which they seem to take their rise). As the tortoise stretches its limbs and withdraws them again, even so the Supreme Soul creates all objects and again withdraws into Himself. The Creator places the five primal elements in all created objects in different proportions. The living creature, however, does not see it (through ignorance). Sound, the organs of hearing, and all holes,—these three,—spring from Space as their progenitor. Touch, action, and skin are the triple attributes of the Wind. Form, eye, and digestion are the triple attributes of Fire or Energy. Taste, all liquid secretions, and the tongue represent the three attributes of Water. Scents, the nose, and the body are the triple properties of Earth. The great (primal) elements are five. The mind is the sixth. The senses and the mind, O Bharata, are (the sources of all) the perceptions of a living creature. [^102] The seventh is called the understanding; and the eighth is the soul. [^103] The senses are for perceiving; the mind (unable to deal with those perceptions) produces uncertainty. The understanding reduces all perceptions to certainty. The Soul exists as a witness (without acting). All that is above the two feet, all that is behind, and all that is above, are seen by the Soul. Know that the Soul pervades the entire being without any space being left unoccupied. All men should know the senses, the mind, and the understanding fully. The three states or qualities called Darkness, Passion, and Goodness, exist, dependent on the senses, the mind, and the understanding. [^104] Man, by apprehending with the aid of his intelligence, the manner in which creatures come and leave the world, is sure to gradually attain to steadfast tranquillity. The three qualities (already mentioned, _viz_., Darkness, Passion, and Goodness), lead the understanding (to worldly attachments). In this respect, the Understanding (or Intelligence) is identical with the Senses and the Mind. The Understanding, therefore, is identical with the six (the five senses and the mind), and also with the objects comprehended by it. When, however, the Understanding is destroyed, the three <span id="p47"><sup><small>[ p. 47 ]</small></sup></span> qualities (of Darkness, Passion, and Goodness) are incapable of leading to action. [^105] This universe of immobile and mobile things consists of that intelligence. It is from that Intelligence that everything arises and it is into it that everything subsides. For this reason, the scriptures indicate that everything is a manifestation of Intelligence. That by which one hears is the ear. That by which one smells is called the organ of smell, and that by which one distinguishes the tastes is called the tongue. By the coat that covers the body one acquires perception of touch. That which is called the Intelligence undergoes modifications. [^106] When the Intelligence desires anything it comes to be called Mind. The foundations upon which the Intelligence rests are five in number, each serving a different purpose. They are called the senses. The invisible principle, _viz_., Intelligence rests on them. The Intelligence that exists in a living creature concerns itself with the three states (called Passion, Darkness, and Goodness). Sometimes it obtains joy and sometimes misery. Sometimes it becomes divested of both joy and misery. Even thus the Intelligence exists in the minds of all men. Sometimes the Intelligence which is made up of the triple states (already mentioned), transcends those three states (by _yoga_), like the lord of rivers, _viz_., the Ocean, with his surges, transgressing his high continents. [^107] That Intelligence which transcends the three qualities exist in the mind in a pure state of (unmodified) existence: alone. The quality of Darkness, however, that impels to action, soon pursues it. At that time, the Intelligence sets all the senses to action. The properties of the three are even thus: joy dwells in Goodness; sorrow in Passion; delusion in Darkness. All the states that exist (of the mind) are included in the three (that have been named). I have now, O Bharata, told thee about the course of the Understanding. An intelligent man should subdue all his senses.. The three qualities of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, are always attached to living creatures. Three kinds of intelligence also are noticeable in every creature, _viz_., that which depends upon Goodness, that upon Passion, and that upon Darkness, O Bharata. The quality of Goodness brings happiness; the quality of Passion produces sorrow; and if these two combine with the quality of <span id="p48"><sup><small>[ p. 48 ]</small></sup></span> Darkness, then neither happiness nor sorrow is produced (but, instead, only delusion or error). Every state of happiness that appears in the body or the mind is said to be due to the quality of Goodness. A state of sorrow, disagreeable to oneself’, that comes, is due to nothing but the quality of Passion. One should never think of it with fear. [^108] That state, again, which is allied with delusion and error, and in consequence of which one knows not what to do, which is unascertainable and unknown, should be regarded as belonging to the quality of Darkness. [^109] Gladness, satisfaction, delight, happiness, tranquillity of heart, these are the properties of the state of Goodness. Man sometimes obtains a measure of them. Discontent, heart-burning, grief, cupidity, vindictiveness are all indications of the state of Passion. They are seen with or without adequate causes for producing them. Disgrace, delusion, error, sleep and stupefaction, that overtake one through excess of ill-luck, are the various properties of the state of Darkness. [^110] That person whose mind is far-reaching, capable of extending in all directions, mistrustful in respect of winning the objects it desires, and well-restrained, is happy both here and hereafter. [^111] Mark the distinction between these two subtile things, _viz_., Intelligence and Soul. One of these (_viz_., intelligence), puts forth the qualities. The other (_viz_., the Soul), does nothing of the kind. A gnat and a fig may be seen to be united with each other. Though united, each however is distinct from the other. Similarly, Intelligence and Soul, though distinguished from each other, by their respective natures, yet they may always be seen to exist in a state of union. A fish and water exist in a state of union, Each, however, is different from the other. The same is the case with Intelligence and Soul. The qualities do not know the Soul, but the Soul knows them all. The Soul is the spectator of the qualities and regards them all as proceeding from itself. The soul, acting through the senses, the mind, and the understanding numbering as the seventh, all of which are inactive and have no self-consciousness, discovers the objects (amid which it exists) like a (covered) lamp showing all objects around it by shedding its rays through an aperture in the covering. The understanding or Intelligence creates all the qualities. The Soul only beholds them (as a witness). Even such is certainly the connection between the intelligence and the Soul. [^112] There is no refuge on which either Intelligence or Soul depends. <span id="p49"><sup><small>[ p. 49 ]</small></sup></span> The Understanding creates the mind, but never the qualities. When the soul, by means of the mind, sufficiently restrains the rays that emanate from the senses, it is then that it becomes manifest (to the Understanding) like a lamp burning within a vessel that covers it. That person who renounces all ordinary acts, practises penances, devotes himself to study the Soul, taking a delight therein, and regards himself as the Soul of all creatures, acquires a high end. As an aquatic fowl, while moving over the waters, is never drenched in that element, even thus does a person of wisdom move (in the world) among creatures. By the aid of one's intelligence one should act in the world after this fashion, without grief, without joy, with an equal eye for all, and destitute of malice and envy. One living in this way succeeds in creating the qualities (instead of being oneself affected by them), like a spider creating threads. [^113] The qualities should, indeed, be regarded as the threads of the spider. Some say that the qualities in respect of such men are not lost. Some say that they are all lost. Those who say that they are not lost rely upon the revealed scriptures (_viz_., the _Srutis_), which do not contain any declaration to the contrary. They, on the other hand, who say that the qualities are all lost rely on the _Smritis_. Reflecting upon both these opinions, one should judge oneself as to which of them is right. One should thus get over this hard and knotty question which is capable c f disturbing the understanding by doubt, and thereby win happiness. When that doubt will be removed, one will no longer have to indulge in sorrow of any kind. Men of filthy hearts may by knowledge obtain success like persons plunging in a well-filled stream purifying themselves of all filth. One who has to cross a broad river does not feel happy at only seeing the other shore. If the case were otherwise (_i.e._, if by only beholding the other shore one could reach it by a boat), then might one become happy. The matter is otherwise with one acquainted with the Truth. The mere knowledge of Truth will bring him happiness. As soon as such knowledge begins to bear fruits, the person may be regarded to have reached the other shore. They who thus know the Soul as freed from all worldly objects and is but the One, are said to obtain high and excellent knowledge. [^114] A person by knowing the origin and the end of all creatures, which is even such, and by reflecting upon the matter, gradually obtains infinite happiness. He that has understood the triple aggregate (_viz_., that it is liable to destruction instead of being eternal), and reflecting upon it, casts it away, succeeds by _yoga_ to behold the Truth and obtain perfect felicity. The Soul is incapable of being seen unless the senses, which are employed on diverse objects and are difficult of being controlled, be all duly restrained. He that knows this is really wise. What other indication is there of a wise man? Acquiring this knowledge, men possessed of intelligence regard themselves to be crowned with success. That which inspires the ignorant with fear can never inspire fear in persons of Knowledge. There is no <span id="p50"><sup><small>[ p. 50 ]</small></sup></span> higher end for anybody (than Emancipation). In consequence, however, of the excess or otherwise of good qualities, the sages say that differences are observable in respect of the degree of Emancipation. A person by acting without expectation of fruits succeeds (by those acts) in annihilating his sinful acts of a former period. To one possessed of wisdom, the acts of a former period (thus washed off) and those of this life also (which are accomplished without expectation of fruit), do not become productive of any disagreeable consequence (such as immurement in hell). But how can acts, if he continues to be engaged in accomplishing acts, bring about what is agreeable (_viz_., Emancipation)? [^115] People censure a person that is afflicted (with lust, envy, and other evil passions). Those vices hurl the person in his next life into diverse kinds of inferior orders. [^116] Mark with close attention the vicious in this world who grieve exceedingly for the loss of their possessions (such as sons and wives, etc.). Behold also those that are gifted with judgment and who never grieve when thrown into similar circumstances. Those that are conversant with both (_i.e._, with gradual Emancipation and immediate Emancipation), deserve to be called truly wise.'" [^117]

## SECTION CXCV

“Bhishma said, ‘I shall now, O son of Pritha, discourse to thee upon the four kinds of _yoga_ meditation. The great _Rishis_, obtaining a knowledge of the same, attain to eternal success even here. Great _Rishis_ gratified with knowledge, with hearts set upon Emancipation, and conversant with _yoga_, act in such a way that their _yoga_ meditation may get on properly. These, O son of Pritha, being freed from the faults of the world, never come back (for rebirth). Liberated from liability to rebirth, they live in their original <span id="p51"><sup><small>[ p. 51 ]</small></sup></span> Soul-state. [^118] Freed from the influence of all pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.), ever existing in their own (original) state, liberated (from attachments), never accepting anything (in gift), they live in places free from the companionship of wives and children, without others with whom disputes may arise, and favourable to perfect tranquillity of heart. There such a person, restraining speech, sits like a piece of wood, crushing all the senses, and with mind undividedly united by the aid of meditation (with the Supreme Soul). He has no perception of sound through the ear; no perception of touch through the skin; no perception of form through the eye; no perception of taste through the tongue. He has no perception also of scents through the organ of smell. Immersed in _yoga_, he would abandon all things, rapt in meditation. Possessed of great energy of mind, he has no desire for anything that excites the five senses. The wise man, withdrawing his five senses into the mind, should then fix the unstable mind with the five senses (into the Intellect). Possessed of patience, the _yogin_ should fix his mind which always wanders (among worldly objects), so that his five gates (under the influence of training) may be made stable in respect of things that are themselves unstable. He should, in the firmament of the heart, fix his mind into the path of meditation, making it independent of the body or any other refuge. I have spoken of the path of meditation as the first, since the yogin has first to crush his senses and the mind (and direct them to that path). The mind, which constitutes the sixth, when thus restrained, seeks to flash out like the capricious and flighty lightning moving in frolic among the clouds. As a drop of water on a (lotus) leaf is unstable and moves about in all directions, even so becomes the _yogin's_ mind when first fixed on the path of meditation. When fixed, for a while the mind stays in that path. When, however, it strays again into the path of the wind, it becomes as flighty as the wind. The person conversant with the ways of yoga-meditation, undiscouraged by this, never regarding the loss of the toil undergone, casting aside idleness and malice, should again direct his mind to meditation. Observing the vow of silence, when one begins to set his mind on yoga, then discrimination, knowledge, and power to avoid evil, are gained by him. [^119] Though feeling annoyed in consequence of the flightiness of his mind, he should fix it (in meditation). The yogin should never despair, but seek his own good. As a heap of dust or ashes; or of burnt cow-dung, when drenched with water, does not seem to be soaked, indeed, as it continues dry if drenched partially, and requires incessant drenching before it becomes thoroughly soaked, even thus should the yogin gradually control all his senses. He should gradually withdraw them (from all objects). The man that acts in this way succeeds in controlling them. One, O Bharata, by oneself directing one's mind and senses to the path of meditation, succeeds in bringing them under perfect <span id="p52"><sup><small>[ p. 52 ]</small></sup></span> control by steadfast yoga. The felicity that he feels who has succeeded in controlling his mind and senses is such that its like can never be obtained through Exertion or Destiny. [^120] United with such felicity, he continues to take a pleasure in the act of meditation. Even in this way yogins attain to Nirvana which is highly blessed.’”


## SECTION CXCVI

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Thou hast discoursed on the four modes of life and their duties. Thou hast also spoken of the duties of kings. Thou hast recited many histories of diverse kinds and connected with diverse topics. I have also heard from thee, O thou of great intelligence, many discourses connected with morality. I have, however, one doubt. It behoveth thee to resolve it. I wish, O Bharata, to hear of the fruits that silent Reciters of sacred _mantras_ acquire (by their practice). What are the fruits that have been indicated for such men? What is that region to which they go after death? It behoveth thee also, O sinless one, to tell me all the rules that have been laid down in respect of such silent recitation? When the word Reciter is uttered, what shall I understand by it? Is such a man to be regarded as following the ordinances of _Sankhya_ or _yoga_ or _work_? [^121] Or, is such a man to be regarded as observing the ordinances about (mental) sacrifices? How is the path of the Reciters to be called? Thou art, as I think, of universal knowledge. Tell me all this.’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old history of what transpired between Yama, Time, and a certain Brahmana. Sages conversant with the means of attaining to Emancipation have spoken of two methods, _viz_., the _Sankhya_ and the _yoga_. Amongst these, in the former, which is otherwise called the Vedanta, Renunciation has been preached with respect to silent recitation. The declarations of the Vedas preach Abstention (from rites), are fraught with tranquillity, and are concerned with _Brahma_. [^122] Indeed, the two paths spoken of by sages bent on achieving what is for their good, _viz_., _Sankhya_ and _yoga_, are such that they are both concerned and again <span id="p53"><sup><small>[ p. 53 ]</small></sup></span> unconcerned (with silent recitations). [^123] The manner in which silent recitation is connected (with each of the two paths) and the cause I shall now explain. In both as in the case of silent recitation, are needed the subduing of the senses and the fixing of the mind (after withdrawal from external objects); as also truth keeping up of the (sacred) fire, residence in solitude, meditation, penance, self-restraint, forgiveness, benevolence, abstemiousness in respect of food, withdrawal from worldly attachments, the absence of talkativeness, and tranquillity. These constitute a sacrifice in acts (leading to the fruition of desire about heaven or felicity in next life). [^124] Listen now to the course that consists of abstention (from acts). The manner in which the acts of the Reciter observing the vow of _Brahmacharya_ may cease, I will presently declare. Such a person should conduct himself in every way according to what has been (already) said by me. [^125] Betaking himself to the path of abstention, he should seek to extinguish his dependence on both the External and the Internal. Sitting on _kusa_ grass, with _kusa_ in hand, and binding his coronal locks with _kusa_, he should surround himself with _kusa_ and have _kusa_ for robes. Bowing unto all earthly concerns, he should take leave of them and never think of them. Assuming equability by the aid of his mind, he should fix his mind on the mind itself. Reciting the highly beneficial composition (_viz_., the _Gayatri_), he meditates with the aid of his intellect on Brahma alone. Afterwards he leaves off even that, being then absorbed in concentrated contemplation. [^126] In consequence of his dependence on the strength of the _Gayatri_ which he recites, this concentrated contemplation will come of itself. By penances he attains to purity of soul, and self-restraint, and cessation of aversion and desire. Freed from attachment and delusion, above the influence of all pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.), he never grieves and never suffers himself to be drawn towards worldly objects. He does not regard himself as the actor nor as the enjoyer or sufferer of the consequences of his acts. He never, through selfishness, fixes his mind on anything. Without being employed in the acquisition of wealth, he abstains also from disregarding or insulting others, but not from work. The work in which he is employed is that of meditation; he is devoted to meditation, and seeks meditation unalterably. By meditation he succeeds in bringing about concentrated contemplation, and then gradually leaves off meditation itself. In that state he enjoys the felicity which attaches to the abandonment of all things. Having thoroughly mastered the principle of desire he casts off his life-breaths and then enters into the _Brahmic_ body. Or, if he does not <span id="p54"><sup><small>[ p. 54 ]</small></sup></span> desire to enter into the Brahmic body, he at once goes upwards into the region of Brahma and has never to undergo rebirth. Having become tranquillity's self, and being freed from all kinds of calamity, such a person, by depending upon his own intelligence, succeeds in attaining to that Soul which is pure and immortal and which is without a stain.’”


## SECTION CXCVII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Thou hast said that as regards Reciters, they obtain this very high end. [^127] I beg to enquire whether this is their only end or there is any other to which they attain.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Listen with concentrated attention, O puissant monarch, to the end that silent Reciters attain, and to the diverse kinds of hell into which they sink, O bull among men! That Reciter who does not at first conduct himself according to the method that has been laid down, and who cannot complete the ritual or course of discipline laid down, has to go to hell. [^128] That Reciter who goes on without faith, who is not contented with his work, and who takes no pleasure in it, goes to hell, without doubt. They who follow the ritual with pride in their hearts, all go to hell. That Reciter who insults and disregards others has to go to hell. That man who betakes himself to silent recitation under the influence of stupefaction and from desire of fruit, obtains all those things upon which his heart becomes set. [^129] That Reciter whose heart becomes set upon the attributes that go by the name of divinity, has to incur hell and never becomes freed from it. [^130] That Reciter who betakes himself to recitation under the influence of attachments (to earthly objects such as wealth, wives etc.) obtain those objects upon which their hearts are set. That Reciter of wicked understanding and uncleansed soul who sets himself to his work with an unstable mind, obtains an unstable end or goes into hell. That Reciter who is not endued with wisdom and who is foolish, becomes stupefied or deluded; and in consequence of such delusion <span id="p55"><sup><small>[ p. 55 ]</small></sup></span> has to go to hell where he is obliged to indulge in regrets. [^131] If a person of even firm heart, resolving to complete the discipline, betakes himself to recitation, but fails to attain to completion in consequence of his having freed himself from attachments by a violent stretch without genuine conviction of their inutility or harmful character, he also has to go to hell [^132].

“Yudhishthira said, ‘When the Reciter attains to the essence of that which exists in its own nature (without being anything like created or born objects), which is Supreme, which is indescribable and inconceivable, and which dwells in the syllable _om_ forming the subject of both recitation and meditation (indeed, when Reciters to a state of _Brahma_), why is it that they have again to take birth in embodied forms?’

“Bhishma, said, ‘In consequence of the absence of true knowledge and wisdom, Reciters obtain diverse descriptions of hell. The discipline followed by Reciters is certainly very superior. These, however, that I have spoken of, are the faults that appertain to it.’”


## SECTION CXCVIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me what description of hell is obtained by a Reciter? I feel, O king, a curiosity to know this. It behoveth thee to discourse on the subject.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Thou hast sprung from a portion of the god of righteousness. Thou art by nature observant of righteousness. Listen, O sinless one, with undivided attention, to these words resting on righteousness as their basis. Those regions that are owned by the high-souled gods, that are of diverse aspects and colours, of diverse descriptions and productive of diverse fruits, and that are of great excellence, those ears again that: move at the will of the riders, those beautiful mansions and hells, those various pleasure-gardens embellished with golden lotuses, those regions that belong to the four Regents and Sukra and Vrihaspati and the Maruts and Viswedevas and Sadhyas and the Aswins, and the Rudras and the Adityas and the Vasus, and other denizens of heaven, are, O sire, spoken of as hells, when compared with the region of the Supreme Soul. The region last spoken of is without any fear (of change for the worse), uncreate (and therefore, in its true nature), without pain of any kind (such as ignorance and delusion), without any agreeable or disagreeable element, beyond the reach of the three attributes (of _Sattwa_, _Rajas_, and _Tamas_), freed from the eight incidents, (_viz_., the five primal elements, the senses, the: mind, and the intellect), without the three (distinctions <span id="p56"><sup><small>[ p. 56 ]</small></sup></span> between the knower, the known, and act of knowing); freed also from the four attributes (seeing, hearing, thinking, and knowing), [^133] without the fourfold causes (of knowledge), without joy and delight and sorrow and disease. Time (in his forms of past, present, and future) arises there for use. Time is not the ruler there. That supreme region is the ruler of Time as also of Heaven. That Reciter who becomes identified with his Soul (by withdrawing everything into it) goes thither. He has, after this, never to feel any sorrow. This region is called Supreme. The other regions (of which I have first spoken) are hell. I have not told thee of all those regions that are called hell. Indeed, in comparison with that foremost of regions all the others are called hell.’


## SECTION CXCIX

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Thou hadst referred to the dispute between Time, Mrityu, Yama, Ikshvaku, and a Brahmana. It behoveth thee to narrate the story in full.’

“Bhishma said, ‘In connection with this subject that I am discoursing upon, is cited the old history of what transpired between Surya's son Ikshvaku and a certain Brahmana, and Time and Mrityu. Listen to me as to what occurred, and what was the conversation that took place between them, and the place where it happened. There was a certain Brahmana of great fame and pious behaviour. He was a Reciter. Possessed of great wisdom, he was conversant with the six _Angas_ (of the Vedas). He was of the Kusika race and son of Pippalada. [^134] He acquired (by his austerities) spiritual insight into the _Angas_. [^135] Residing at the foot of Himavat, he was devoted to the Vedas. Silently reciting the Gayatri composition, he practised severe austerities for attaining to Brahma. A thousand years passed over his head while he was engaged in the observance of vows and fasts. The goddess (of _Gayatri_ or Savitri) showed herself to him and said, ‘I am gratified with thee.’ Continuing to recite the sacred mantra, the Brahmana remained silent and spoke not a word to the goddess. The goddess felt compassion for him and became highly gratified. Then that progenitrix of the Vedas applaud that recitation in which the Brahmana had been engaged. After finishing his recitation (for that day) the Brahmana stood up and, bending his head, prostrated himself before the goddess's feet. The righteous-souled Reciter, addressing the goddess, said, ‘By good luck, O goddess, thou hast been gratified with me and shown thyself to me. If, indeed, thou art gratified with me, the boon I ask is that my heart <span id="p57"><sup><small>[ p. 57 ]</small></sup></span> may take pleasure in act of recitation.’

“Savitri said, ‘What dost thou ask, O regenerate _Rishi_? What wish of thine shall I accomplish? Tell me, O foremost of Reciters, everything will be as thou wishest.’ Thus addressed by the goddess, the Brahmana, conversant with duties, replied, saying, ‘Let my wish about continuing my recitations go on increasing every moment. Let also, O auspicious goddess, the absorption of my mind into _Samadhi_ be more complete.’ The goddess sweetly said, ‘Let it be as thou wishest.’ Desiring to do good to the Brahmana, the goddess once again addressed him, saying, ‘Thou shalt not have to go to hell, _i.e._, thither where great Brahmanas go. Thou shalt go into the region of Brahma which is uncreate and free from every fault. I go hence, but that which thou hast asked me shall happen. [^136] Go on reciting with restrained soul and rapt attention. The god Dharma will in person come to thee. Time, Mrityu. and Yama also will all approach thy presence. There will be a dispute here between them and thee on a question of morality.’

‘Bhishma continued, ‘Having said these words, the goddess went back to her own abode. The Brahmana. continued engaged in recitation for a thousand celestial years. Restraining wrath, and always controlling self, he passed his time, firmly devoting himself to truth and freed from malice. Upon the completion of his observance by the intelligent Brahmana, Dharma, gratified with him, showed his person unto that regenerate individual.’

‘Dharma said, ‘O regenerate one, behold me who am Dharma. I have come here for seeing thee. Thou hast won the reward of this recitation in which thou hadst been engaged. Listen to ma as to what that reward is. Thou hast won all the regions of felicity which appertain to either gods or men. O good man, thou shalt ascend above all the abodes of the deities. O ascetic, cast off thy vital breaths then, and go unto whatever regions thou pleasest. By casting off thy body thou wilt win many regions of felicity.’

“The Brahmana said, ‘What business have I with those regions of felicity of which thou speakest? O Dharma, go whithersoever thou pleasest. I will not, O puissant lord, cast off this body which is subject to much happiness and misery.’

“Dharma said, ‘Thy body, O foremost of ascetics, should certainly be cast off. Do thou ascend to heaven, O Brahmana! Or, tell us what else should please thee, O sinless one!’

“The Brahmana said, ‘I do not, O puissant lord, wish to reside in heaven itself without this body of mine. Leave me, O Dharma! I have no desire to go to heaven itself without my own body.’

“Dharma said, ‘Without (thus) setting thy heart on thy body, cast it off and be happy Go into regions that are free from the attribute of Passion. Indeed, going thither, thou shalt never have to feel any misery.’

“The Brahmana said, ‘O highly-blessed one, I take great pleasure in recitation. What need have I for those eternal regions of which thou <span id="p58"><sup><small>[ p. 58 ]</small></sup></span> speakest? Indeed, O puissant lord, I do not desire to go to heaven with even this body of mine.’

“Dharma said, ‘If thou dost not wish to cast off thy body, behold, O regenerate one, there is Time, and there is Mrityu, and there is Yama, who are all approaching thee!’

‘Bhishma continued, ‘After Dharma had said this, Vivaswat's son (Yama), Time, and Mrityu,—the trio (who snatch away all creatures from the earth), approached that Brahmana, O blessed king, and addressed him thus.’

“Yama said, ‘I am Yama. I say unto thee that a high reward awaits thee for these well-performed penances of thine, and for this pious conduct that thou hast observed.’

“Time said, ‘Thou hast won a high reward which is, indeed, commensurate with this course of recitation that thou hast finished. The time is come for thee to ascend to heaven.. I am Time and I have come to thee.’

“Mrityu said, ‘O thou that art conversant with righteousness, know me for Mrityu herself in her proper form. I have come to thee in person, urged by Time, for bearing thee hence, O Brahmana.’

“The Brahmana said, ‘Welcome to Surya's son, to Time possessed of high soul, to Mrityu, and to Dharma! What shall I accomplish for you all.

“Bhishma continued, ‘In that meeting, the Brahmana gave them water to wash their feet, and the usual articles of the _Arghya_. Highly gratified, he then addressed them, saying, ‘What shall I do for you all by exerting my own might?’ Just at that time, 01 monarch, (king) Ikshvaku, who had set out on a sojourn to holy waters and shrines, came to that spot where those deities had been assembled together. ‘The royal sage Ikshvaku bowed his head and worshipped them all. That best of kings then enquired after the welfare of all of them. The Brahmana gave the king a seat, as also water to wash his feet, and the usual _Arghya_. Having next made the usual enquiries of courtesy, he said, ‘Thou art welcome, O great monarch! Tell me all this thy wishes! Let thy noble self tell me what I shall have to accomplish for thee by putting forth my might.’

“The king said, ‘I am a king. Thou art a Brahmana in the observance of the six well-known duties. (1 cannot ask), I will give thee some wealth. That is well-known. Tell me how much I shall give thee.’

“The Brahmana said, ‘There are two kinds of Brahmanas, O monarch! Morality of righteousness also is of two kinds; addiction to work, and abstention from work. As regards myself, I have abstained from acceptance of gifts. Give presents unto them, O, king, that are addicted to the duty of work and acceptance. I shall not, therefore, accept anything in gift. On the other hand, I ask thee, what is for thy good? What, indeed, shall I give thee? Tell me, O foremost of kings, and I shall accomplish it with the aid of my penances.’

“The king said, 

“The Brahmana said, ‘Thou art content with the observance of the duties of thy order. Similarly, I am content with the duties of mine, O king! There <span id="p59"><sup><small>[ p. 59 ]</small></sup></span> is, therefore, little difference between us. Do as thou pleasest!’

“The king said, 

“The Brahmana said, ‘Thou wert boasting that thy utterances always solicit battle. Why then dost thou not solicit battle with me?’

“The king said, ‘It has been said that Brahmanas are armed with the thunder of speech, and that Kshatriyas have might of arms. Hence, learned Brahmana, this wordy warfare has set in between thee and me.’

“The Brahmana said, ‘As regards myself, even that is my resolution today. What shall I give thee according to my might? Tell me, O king of kings, and I shall give thee, having wealth of my own. Do not tarry.’

“The king said, ‘If, indeed, thou desirest to give me anything, then give me the fruits thou hast earned by practising recitation for these thousand years.’

“The Brahmana said, ‘Take the highest fruit of the recitations I have gone through. Indeed, take half, without any scruple, of that fruit. Or, O king, if thou wishest, take without any scruple the entire fruits of my recitations.’

“The king said, ‘Blessed be thou, I have no need for the fruits of thy recitations which I solicited. Blessings on thy head. I am about to leave thee. Tell me, however, what those fruits are (of thy recitations).’

“The Brahmana said, ‘I have no knowledge of the fruits I have won. I have, however, given thee those fruits that I have acquired by recitation. These, _viz_., Dharma and Time, and Yama, and Mrityu, are witnesses (of the act of gift).’

“The king said, ‘What will the fruits, that are unknown, of these thy observances, do for me? If thou dost not tell me what the fruits are of thy recitations, let those fruits be thine, for without doubt I do not wish for them.’

“The Brahmana said, 

“The king said, ‘To fight and protect (subjects) are the duties of Kshatriyas. It is said that Kshatriyas are givers (of presents). How then shall I take anything from thee (in gift)?’

“The Brahmana said, ‘I never insisted on thee, O king (for accepting anything from me in the first instance). I did not seek thy house. Thyself, coming here, didst solicit me. Why then dost thou not take?’

“Dharma said, ‘Know ye both that I am Dharma himself. Let there be no dispute between you. Let the Brahmana become endued with the reward attaching to gift, and let the monarch also obtain the merit of Truth.’

“Heaven said, ‘Know, O great king, that I am Heaven's self in my embodied form, come hither in person. Let this dispute between you cease. You are both equal in respect of the merit or rewards earned.’

“The king said, ‘I have no use with Heaven. Go, O Heaven, to the place you have come from. If this learned Brahmana desires to repair to thee, let him take the rewards that I have won (by my acts in life).’

“The Brahmana said, ‘In my younger days I had, through ignorance, stretched my hand (for acceptance of gifts). At present, however, I recite the _Gayatri_, observing the duty of abstention. [^137] Why dost thou, O king, tempt me thus, me who have for a long time observed the duty of abstention? I shall myself do what my duty is. I do not wish to have any share of the rewards won by thee, O monarch! I am devoted to penances and to study of the <span id="p61"><sup><small>[ p. 61 ]</small></sup></span> Vedas, and I have abstained from acceptance.’

“The king said, ‘If, O Brahmana, thou art really to give me the excellent reward of thy recitation, then let half that reward be mine, thyself taking at the same time half the reward that I myself have won by my acts. Brahmanas are engaged in the duty of acceptance. Persons born in the royal order are engaged in the duty of giving. If thou art not unaware of the duties (laid down for both the orders), let our fruits be equal (according to the suggestion I have made). Or, if thou dost not wish to be my equal in respect of our rewards, take then the whole of the rewards that I may have won. Do take the merit I have won, if thou wishest to show me grace.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘At this time, two individuals of very ungainly aspect came there. Each had his arm upon the other's shoulder; both were ill-dressed. They said these words, ‘Thou owest me nothing. I really owe thee. If we dispute in this way, here is the king who ruleth individuals. I say truly, thou owest me nothing! Thou speakest falsely. I do owe thee a debt. Both of them, waxing very hot in dispute, then addressed the king, saying, ‘See, O monarch, that none of us may become stained with sin.’

“Virupa said, ‘I woe my companion, Vikrita, O monarch, the merits of the gift of a cow. I am willing to pay off that debt. This Vikrita, however, refuses to take repayment.’ [^138]

“Vikrita said, ‘This Virupa, O monarch, oweth me nothing. He speaks a falsehood with the appearance of truth, O king.’

“The king said, ”Tell me, O Virupa, what is that which thou owest thy friend here. It is my resolution to hear thee and then do what is proper.’

“Virupa said, ‘Hear attentively, O king, all the circumstances in detail, about how I owe my companion, _viz_., this Vikrita, O ruler of men. This Vikrita had, in bygone days, for the sake of winning merit, O sinless one, given away an auspicious cow, O royal sage, unto a Brahmana devoted to penances as the study of the Vedas. Going unto him, O king, I begged of him the reward of that act. With a pure heart, Vikrita made a gift to me of that reward. I then, for my purification, did some good acts. I also purchased two _kapila_ cows with calves, both of which used to yield large quantities of milk. I then made a present, according to due rites and with proper devotion, of those two cows unto a poor Brahmana living by the _Unchha_ [^139] method. Having formerly accepted the gift from my companion, I desire, O lord, even here, to give him return twice the reward! [^140] The circumstances being such, O tiger among men, who amongst us two shall be innocent and who guilty (according to your judgment)? Disputing with each other about this, we have both come to thee, O monarch! Whether thou judgest rightly or wrongly, establish both of us in peace. If this my companion does not wish to take <span id="p62"><sup><small>[ p. 62 ]</small></sup></span> from me in return a gift equal to what he gave me, thou shalt have to judge patiently and set us both on the right track.’

“The king said, ‘Why do you not accept payment that is sought to be made of the debt that is owing to thee? Do not delay, but accept payment of what thou knowest is thy due.’

“Vikrita said, ‘This one says that he owes me. I say unto him that what I gave I gave away. He doth not, therefore, owe me anything. Let him go whithersoever he wishes.’

“The king said, ‘He is ready to give thee. Thou., however, art unwilling to take. This does not seem proper to me. I think that thou deservest punishment for this. There is little doubt in this.’

“Vikrita said, ‘I made a gift to him, O royal sage! How can I take it back? If I am guilty in this, do thou pronounce the punishment, O puissant one.’

“Virupa said, ‘If thou refusest to take when I am ready to give, this king will certainly punish thee, for he is an upholder of justice.’

“Vikrita said, ‘Solicited by him I gave him what was my own. How shall I now retake that? Thou mayst go away. Thou hast my leave.’

“The Brahmana said, ‘Thou hast heard, O king, the words of these two. Do thou take without scruple that which I have pledged myself to give thee.’

“The king said, ‘This matter is, indeed, as deep (in importance) as an unfathomable pit. How will the pertinacity of this Reciter end? If I do not accept what has been given by this Brahmana, how shall I avoid being stained with a great sin?’ The royal sage then said unto the two disputants, ‘Go ye both, having won your respective objects. I should see that kingly duties, vested in me, may not become futile. It is settled that kings should observe the duties laid down for them. To my misfortune, however, the course of duties prescribed for Brahmanas has possessed my wretched self.’ [^141]

“The Brahmana said, ‘Accept, O king! I owe thee. Thou didst solicit it, and I also have become pledged (to give thee). If, however, thou refuse to take, O monarch, I shall without doubt curse thee.’

“The king said, ‘Fie on kingly duties, the settled conclusion about the operation of which is even such. I should, however, take what thou givest, for only this reason, _viz_., rendering the two courses of duty exactly equal. [^142] This is my hand, that was never before (stretched forth for acceptance of gifts), <span id="p63"><sup><small>[ p. 63 ]</small></sup></span> is now stretched forth (for acceptance as also) for giving away. Give me what thou owest me.’

“The Brahmana said, ‘If I have won any fruits by reciting the _Gayatri_, accept them all.’

“The king said, ‘These drops of water, behold, O foremost of Brahmanas, have fallen upon my hand. I also desire to give thee. Accept my gift. Let there be equality between us (through thy accepting my gift as I have accepted thine).’

“Virupa said, ‘Know, O king, that we two are Desire and Wrath. It hath been by us that thou hast been induced to act in this way. Thou hast made a gift in return to the Brahmana. Let there be equality between thee and this regenerate person in respect of regions—of felicity in the next world. This Vikrita really does not owe me anything. We appealed to thee for thy own sake. Time, Dharma, Mrityu, and we two, have examined everything about thee, here in thy very presence, by producing this friction between thee and that Brahmana. Go now, as thou choosest, to those regions of felicity which thou hast won by means of thy deeds.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘I have now told thee how Reciters obtain the fruits (of their recitation) and what, indeed, is their end, what the spot, and what the regions, that a Reciter may win. A Reciter of _Gayatri_ goes to the supreme god Brahman, or repairs to Agni or enters the region of Surya. If he sports there in his (new) energetic form, then stupefied by such attachment, he catches the attributes of those particular regions. [^143] The same becomes the case with him if he goes to Soma, or Vayu, or Earth, or Space. The fact is, he dwells in all these, with attachment, and displays the attributes peculiar to those regions. If, however, he goes to those regions after having freed himself from attachments, and feels a. mistrust (respecting the felicity he enjoys) and wishes for That Which is Supreme and Immutable, he then enters even That. In that case he attains to the ambrosia of ambrosia, to a state free from desire and destitute of separate consciousness. He becomes _Brahma's_ self freed from the influence of opposites, happy, tranquil, and without pain. [^144] Indeed, he attains to, that condition which is free from pain, which is tranquillity's self, which is; called _Brahma_, whence there is no return, and which is styled the One and Immutable. He becomes freed from the four means of apprehension, [^145] the six conditions, and also the other six and ten attributes. [^146] Transcending the Creator (Brahman), he attains to absorption into the One Supreme Soul. Or, if under the influence of attachments, he wishes not for such absorption, but desires to have a separate existence as dependent on that Supreme Cause of everything, then obtains the fruition of everything for which he cherishes a wish. Or, if he looks (with aversion) upon all regions of felicity, which have been (as previously stated) <span id="p64"><sup><small>[ p. 64 ]</small></sup></span> called hells, he then, driving off desire and freed from everything, enjoys supreme felicity even in those very regions. [^147] Thus, O monarch, I have discoursed to thee about the end attained by Reciters. I have told thee everything. What else thou wishest to hear?'”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, what reply was given by either the Brahmana or the monarch to Virupa after the conclusion of the latter's speech. What kind of end was it, amongst those described by thee, that they obtained? What, indeed, was the discourse that happened between them, and what did they do there?’

“Bhishma said, ‘The Brahmana, saying, ‘Let it be as thou hast said, ‘worshipped Dharma and Yama and Time and Mrityu and Heaven, all of whom were worthy of worship. He also worshipped all those foremost of Brahmanas that had come there by bending his head unto them. Addressing the monarch then, he said, ‘Endued with the reward of my recitations, O royal sage, attain thou to a position of eminence. With thy leave I shall set myself to my recitations again. O thou of great might, the goddess Savitri gave me a boon, saying, ‘Let thy devotion to recitations be continuous.’

“The king said, ‘If thy success (in recitation) has b.-come fruitless (in consequence of thy having given away those fruits unto me), and if thy heart be set upon practising again, go, O learned Brahmana, half and half with me, and let the reward of thy recitations themselves be thine.’ [^148]

“The Brahmana said, ‘Thou hast made strenuous efforts before all these persons (for making me a sharer of the rewards in store for thee as the consequences of thy own acts). Let us then become equal in respect of our rewards (in next life), and let us go to receive that end which is ours.’ Knowing the resolve to which they came there, the chief of the gods came to that spot, accompanied by the deities and the Regents of the world. The _Sadhyas_, the _Viswas_, the _Mantras_, diverse kinds of loud and sweet music, the Rivers, the Mountains, the Seas, the Sacred Waters, the Penances, the Ordinances about _yoga_, the Vedas, the Sounds that accompany the singing of the Samans, Saraswati, Narada, Parvata, Viswavasu, the Hahas, the Huhus, the _Gandharva_ Chitrasena with all the members of his family, the Nagas, the _Sadhyas_, the <span id="p65"><sup><small>[ p. 65 ]</small></sup></span> _Munis_, the god of gods, _viz_., Prajapati, and the inconceivable and thousand-headed Vishnu himself, came there. Drums and trumpets were beat and blown in the firmament. Celestial flowers were rained down upon those high-souled beings. Bands of _Apsaras_ danced all around. Heaven, in his embodied form, came there. Addressing the Brahmana, he said, ‘Thou hast attained to success. Thou art highly blessed.’ Next addressing the monarch, he said, ‘Thou also, O king, hast attained to success.’ Those two persons then, O monarch (_viz_., the Brahmana and the king), having done good to each other, withdrew their senses from the objects of the world. Fixing the vital breaths _Prana_, _Apana_, _Samana_, _Udana_ and _Vyana_ in the heart, they concentrated the mind in _Prana_ and _Apana_ united together. They then placed the two united breaths in the abdomen, and directed their gaze to the tip of the nose and then immediately below the two eye-brows. They next held the two breaths, with the aid of the mind, in the spot that intervenes between the two eye-brows, bringing them there very gradually. With bodies perfectly inactive, they were absorbed with fixed gaze. Having control over their souls, they then placed the soul within the brain. Then piercing the crown of the high-souled Brahmana a fiery flame of great splendour ascended to heaven. Loud exclamations of woe, uttered by all creatures, were then heard on all sides. Its praises hymned by all, that splendour then entered Brahman's self. The Great grandsire, advancing forward, addressed that splendour which had assumed a form of the tallness of a span, saying, ‘Welcome!’ And once more he uttered these words, ‘Verily, Reciters attain to the same end with the yogins. The attainment by the yogin of his end is an object of direct vision unto all these (here assembled). As regards Reciters, there is this distinction, that the honour is ordained for them of Brahman's advancing forward to receive them (after their departure from earth). [^149] Dwell thou in me.’ Thus spoke Brahman and once more imparted consciousness into that splendour. Indeed, the Brahmana then, freed from all anxieties, entered the mouth of the Creator. The monarch (Ikshvaku) also, after the same manner, entered the divine Grandsire like that foremost of Brahmanas. The (assembled) deities saluted the self-born and said, ‘A very superior end is, indeed, ordained for Reciters. This exertion (that we have seen thee put forth) is for Reciters. As regards ourselves, we came hither for beholding it. Thou hast made these two equal, rendered them equal honour, and bestowed upon them an equal end. The high end that is reserved for both yogins and Reciters has been seen by us today. Transcending all regions (of felicity), these two are capable of going whithersoever they wish.’

“Brahman said, ‘He also that would read the great _Smriti_ (_viz_., the Veda), and he too, who would read the other auspicious _Smritis_ that follow the former (_viz.,_ Manu's and the rest), would, in this way, attain to the same region with me. He also who is devoted to yoga, will, without doubt, acquire in this manner, after death, the regions that are mine. I go hence. Go ye all <span id="p66"><sup><small>[ p. 66 ]</small></sup></span> to your respective places for the accomplishment of your ends.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Having said these words, that foremost of gods disappeared there and then. The assembled deities, having previously taken his leave, returned to their respective abodes. All those high-souled beings, having honoured Dharma, proceeded with well-pleased hearts, O monarch, walking behind that great deity. These are the rewards of reciters and this their end. I have described them to thee as I myself had heard of them. What else, O monarch, dost thou wish to hear of?’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘What are the fruits of the yoga represented by Knowledge, of all the Vedas, and of the (various) observances and vows? How also may the creature-soul be known? Tell us, this, O grandsire!’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old narrative of the discourse between that lord of creatures, _viz_., Manu, and the great _Rishi_, Vrihaspati. In days of old, the foremost of celestial _Rishis_, _viz_., Vrihaspati, who was a disciple of Manu, bowed to his preceptor and addressing that lord and first of all creatures, said, ‘What is the cause (of the universe)? Whence have the ordinances (about sacrifices and other pious observances) flowed? What are those fruits which the learned say are attached to Knowledge? Tell me also truly, O illustrious one, what is that which the very, Vedas have not been able to reveal? What are those fruits which are adored by eminent personages conversant with the science of _Artha_, with the Vedas, and with the _Mantras_, through sacrifices and plentiful gifts of kine? Whence do those fruits arise? Where are they to be found? Tell me also this old history, _viz_., whence have the earth, all earthly objects, wind, sky, aquatic creatures, water, heaven, and the denizens of heaven, all sprung? Man's inclinations tend towards that object about which he seeks knowledge. I have no knowledge of that Ancient and Supreme one. How shall I rescue myself from a false display of inclinations towards Him? [^150] The _Riks_, all the _Samanas_, all the _Yajuses_, the _Chhandas_, Astronomy, _Nirukta_, Grammar, _Sankalpa_, and _Siksha_, I have studied. But I pave no knowledge of the nature of the great creatures (the five primal elements) that enter into the composition of everything. [^151] Tell me all I have asked thee, by using only simple assertions and distinguishing <span id="p67"><sup><small>[ p. 67 ]</small></sup></span> adjectives or attributes. Tell me what the fruits are of Knowledge and what those fruits that are attached to sacrifices and other religious rites. Explain to me how also an embodied being departs from his body and how he attains to another body.’

“Manu said, ‘That which is agreeable to one is said to constitute one's happiness. Similarly, that which is disagreeable to one is said to constitute one's misery.—By this I shall obtain happiness and keep off misery—from a sentiment like this flow all religious acts. The efforts for the acquisition of Knowledge, however, arise from a sentiment for avoiding both happiness and misery. [^152] The ordinances about sacrifices and other observances, that occur in the Vedas, are all connected with desire. He, however, who liberates himself from desire, succeeds in attaining to _Brahma_. That man who, from desire of winning happiness, walks in the path of acts which are of diverse kinds, has to go to hell.’ [^153]

“Vrihaspati said, ‘Men's aspirations are concerned with the acquisition of the agreeable which ends in happiness, and the avoidance of the disagreeable which brings misery. Such acquisition and such avoidance again are accomplished by acts.’ [^154]

“Manu said, ‘It is by liberating oneself from acts that one succeeds in entering into _Brahma_. The ordinances about acts have flowed for that very end. [^155] The ordinances about acts tempts only those whose hearts are not free from desire. By liberating oneself from acts (as already said) one acquires the highest state. One desirous of felicity (Emancipation), betaking oneself to religious rites, becomes purified (from attachments) by acts having for their object the purification of the soul, and at last wins great splendour. By liberating oneself from acts, one acquires the highest end, _viz_., _Brahma_, which is very much above the reward that acts give. Creatures have all been created by Mind and Act. These again are the two best paths adored by all. Outward acts produce fruits that are transitory as also eternal. For acquiring the latter there is no other means than abandonment of fruits by the mind. [^156] As the eye, when night passes away and the veil of darkness is removed from it, leads its possessor by its own power, so the Understanding, when it <span id="p68"><sup><small>[ p. 68 ]</small></sup></span> becomes endued with Knowledge, succeeds in beholding all evils that are worthy of avoidance. [^157] Snakes, sharp-pointed _kusa_ blades, and pits, men avoid when they perceive them lie on their way. If some tread upon or fall into them, they do so through ignorance. Behold the superiority of the fruits of knowledge (over those of ignorance). _Mantras_ applied duly, sacrifices, the presents called _Dakshina_, gift of food, and concentration of the mind (for divine contemplation),—these are the five acts that are said to be productive of fruits, there being none else. Acts have (the three) attributes (of _Sattwa_, _Rajas_, and _Tamas_) for their soul. The Vedas say this. (The Vedas consist of _Mantras_). The _Mantras_, therefore, have the same three attributes, since it is with _Mantras_ that acts are to be accomplished. The ritual also must be liable to the same three attributes. The fruits of action depend upon the mind. It is the embodied creature that enjoys those fruits. [^158] All excellent kinds of sound, form, taste, touch, and scent, are the fruits of acts, being attainable in the region of acts (_i.e._, heaven). As regards, however, the fruits of knowledge, man acquires them even here before death. [^159] Whatever acts are accomplished by means of the body, one enjoys the fruits thereof in a state of physical existence. The body is, indeed, the framework to which happiness inheres, as also the framework to which misery inheres. [^160] Whatever acts are accomplished by means of words, their fruits are to be enjoyed in a state in which words can be spoken. Similarly, whatever acts are accomplished by the mind, their fruits are enjoyed in a state in which one is not freed from the mind. [^161] Devoted to the fruits of acts, whatever kind of acts (_Sattwika_ or <span id="p69"><sup><small>[ p. 69 ]</small></sup></span> _Rajasika_ or _Tamasika_) a person covetous of fruits accomplishes, the fruits, good or bad, that he actually enjoys partake of their character. Like fishes going against a current of water, the acts of a past life come to the actor. The embodied creature experiences happiness for his good acts, and misery for his evil ones. Him from whom this universe hath sprung. Him by knowing whom persons of cleansed souls transgress this world, Him who has not been expressed by Vedic _mantras_ and words. I will now indicate. Listen to me as I speak of that highest of the high. Himself liberated from the several kinds of taste and scent, and sound and touch and form. He is incapable of being grasped by the senses, unmanifest, without colour, the One, and He has created the five kinds of objects [^162] for His creatures. He is neither female, nor male, nor of the neuter sex. He is neither existent, nor non-existent, nor existent-nonexistent. [^163] Only those that are acquainted with _Brahma_ behold Him. He knoweth no direction.”’

“Manu said, ‘From that eternal and undeteriorating One first sprang Space; from space came Wind; from wind came Light; from light came Water; from water sprang the Universe; and from the universe, all things that occur in it. The bodies of all (earthly) things, (after dissolution), first enter into water, thence to light or heat, thence to the wind, and thence to space. They that seek Emancipation have not to return from space. On the other hand, they attain to Brahma. The refuge of Emancipation, _viz_., Brahma, is neither hot, nor cold, neither mild nor fierce, neither sour nor astringent, neither sweet nor bitter. He is not endued with sound, or scent, or form. He transcends all these and everything, and is without dimensions. [^164] The skin perceives touch; the tongue, taste; the nose, scent; the ears, sounds; and the eyes, forms. Men not conversant with _Adhyatma_ succeed not in beholding what is above these. Having withdrawn the tongue from tastes, the nose from scents, the ears from touch, and the eyes from forms, one succeeds in beholding one's own self (as independent of the senses and the mind and, therefore, of attributes). [^165] It hath been said that that which is the Cause of the actor, the act, the material with which the act is done, the place and the time of the act, and the inclinations and propensities in respect of happiness and misery, is called the Self (or Soul). That which pervades everything, which does everything (assuming the forms of living creatures), that which exists in <span id="p70"><sup><small>[ p. 70 ]</small></sup></span> the universe even as the _mantras_ declare, [^166] that which is the cause of all, that which is the highest of the high, and that which is One without a second and does all things, is the Cause. Everything else is effect. It is seen that a person, in consequence of the acts performed by him, obtains results both good and evil, which (though apparently incompatible with each other, still) dwell together in harmony. Indeed, as the good and evil fruits born of their own acts dwell together in the bodies of creatures which are their refuge, even so Knowledge dwells in the body. [^167] As a lighted lamp, while burning, discovers other objects before it, even so the five senses which are like lamps set on high trees, find out their respective objects when lighted by Knowledge. [^168] As the various ministers of a king, uniting together, give him counsel, even so the five senses that are in the body are all subservient to Knowledge. The latter is superior to all of them. As the flames of fire, the current of the wind, the rays of the sun, and the waters of rivers, go and come repeatedly, even so the bodies of embodied creatures are going and coming repeatedly. [^169] As a person by taking up an axe cannot, by cutting open a piece of wood, find either smoke or fire in it, even so one cannot, by cutting open the arms and feet and stomach of a person, see the principle of knowledge, which, of course, has nothing in common with the stomach, the arms and the feet. As again, one beholds both smoke and fire in wood by rubbing it against another piece, so a person of well-directed intelligence and wisdom, by uniting (by means of _yoga_) the senses and the soul, may view the Supreme Soul which, of course, exists in its own nature. [^170] As in the midst of a dream one beholds one's own body lying on the ground as something distinct from one's own self, even so a person, endued with the five senses, the mind, and the understanding, beholds (after death) his own body and then goes from one into another form [^171]. The Soul is not subject to birth, growth, decay, and destruction. In consequence of the acts of life being endued with effects, the Soul, clothed in body, passes <span id="p71"><sup><small>[ p. 71 ]</small></sup></span> from this body (when deprived of animation) into another, unseen by others. [^172] No one can behold with the eye the form of the Soul. The Soul cannot, again, form the subject of any one's touch. With those (_i.e._, the senses), the Soul accomplishes no act. The senses do not approach the Soul. The Soul, however, apprehends them all. As anything, placed in a blazing fire before a spectator, assumes a certain colour in consequence of the light and heat that operates upon it, without taking any other hue or attribute, even so the Soul's form is seen to take its colour from the body. After the same manner, man, casting off one body, enters another, unseen by all. Indeed, casting off his body to the (five) great primal elements, he assumes a form that is similarly made of the same (five) elements. The embodied creature (upon the destruction of his body) enters space, wind, fire, water, and earth in such a way that each particular element in his body mingles with the particular element (out of his body) with whose nature it is consonant. The senses also, which are engaged in diverse occupations and dependent on the five elements (for the exercise of their functions), enter these five elements that call forth their functions. The ear derives its capacity from space; and the sense of scent from the earth. Form, which is the property of the eye, is the consequence of light or fire. Fire or heat has been said to be the dependent cause of water. The tongue which has for its property taste becomes merged into water. The skin which has touch for its property becomes lost in the wind whose nature it partakes. The fivefold attributes, (_viz_., sound, etc.) dwell in the (five) great creatures (_viz_., the five primal elements). Those fivefold objects of the senses (_viz_., space, etc.) dwell in the (five) senses. All these again (_viz_., the fivefold attributes, the fivefold elements, and the five senses) follow the lead of the mind. The mind follows the lead of the Understanding, and the Understanding follows the lead of That which exists in its true and undefiled nature (_viz_., the Supreme Soul). [^173] The doer in his new body receives all the good and bad acts done by him as also all acts done by him in his past existence. All these acts done in this life and the next ones to come follow the mind even as aquatic animals pass along a genial current. As a quickly-moving and restless thing becomes an object of sight, as a minute object appears to be possessed of large dimensions (when seen through spectacles), as a mirror shows a person his own face (which cannot otherwise be seen), even so the Soul (though subtile and invisible) become an object of the Understanding's apprehension.’” [^174]

<span id="p72"><sup><small>[ p. 72 ]</small></sup></span>

## SECTION CCIII

“Manu said, ‘The mind united with the senses, recollects after a long time the impressions of the objects received in the past. When the senses are all suspended (in respect of their functions), [^175] the Supreme (the Soul), in the form of the Understanding, exists in its own true nature. When the Soul (at such a time) does not in the least regard all those objects of the senses in respect of their simultaneity or the reverse in point of time but mustering them from all directions holds them before it together, it necessarily happens that he wanders among all things that are incongruous. He is, therefore, the (silent) Witness. Hence the Soul encased in body is something having a distinct and independent existence. [^176] There is _Rajas_, there is _Tamas_, and there is _Sattwa_, the third. There are again three states of the understanding, _viz_., waking, dreaming, and sound sleep. The Soul has knowledge of the pleasures and pains, which are all contradictory, of those states, and which partake of the nature of the threefold attributes first mentioned. [^177] The Soul enters the senses like the wind entering the fire in a piece of wood. [^178] One cannot behold the form of the Soul by one's eye, nor can the sense of touch, amongst the senses, apprehend it. The Soul is not, again, an object of apprehension by the ear. It may, however, be seen by the aid of the _Srutis_ and the instructions of the wise. As regards the senses, that particular sense which apprehends it loses upon such apprehension its existence as a sense. [^179] The senses cannot themselves apprehend their respective forms by themselves. The Soul is omniscient (inasmuch as it apprehends both the knower and the known). It beholds all things. Being omniscient, it is the Soul that beholds the senses (without, as already said, the senses being able to apprehend it). Nobody has seen the other side of the Himavat mountains, nor the reverse of the moon's disc. Yet it cannot be said that these do not <span id="p73"><sup><small>[ p. 73 ]</small></sup></span> exist. Similarly, though never apprehended by the senses, yet nobody can say that the Soul, which dwells in all creatures, which is subtile, and which has knowledge for its essence, does not exist. People see the world reflected on the moon's disc in the form of spots. Though seeing, they do not know that it is the world that is so reflected there. Even such is the knowledge of the Soul. That knowledge must come of itself. The Soul depends upon the Soul itself. Men of wisdom, reflecting on the formlessness of visible objects before birth and after destruction, behold by the aid of intelligence, the formlessness of objects that have apparent forms, So also although the Sun's motion cannot be seen, yet persons, by watching its rising and setting, conclude that the sun has motion. [^180] Similarly, those who are endued with wisdom and learning behold the Soul by the aid of the lamp of intelligence, though it is at a great distance from them, and seek to merge the fivefold elements, which are near, into _Brahma_. [^181] Verily, an object cannot be accomplished without the application of means. Fishermen catch fish by means of nets made of strings. Animals are captured by employing animals as are the means. Birds are caught by employing birds as the means. Elephants are taken by employing elephants. In this way, the Soul may be apprehended by the principle of knowledge. We have heard that only a snake can see a snake's legs. After the same manner one beholds, through Knowledge, the Soul encased in subtile form and dwelling within the gross body. People cannot, through their senses, know the senses. Similarly, mere Intelligence at its highest cannot behold the Soul which is supreme. The moon, on the fifteenth day of the dark fortnight, cannot be seen in consequence of its form being hid. It cannot be said, however, that destruction overtakes it, Even such is the case with the Soul dwelling in the body. On the fifteenth day of the dark fortnight, the gross body of the moon becomes invisible. After the same manner, the Soul, when liberated from the body, cannot be apprehended. As the moon, gaining another point in the firmament begins to shine once more, similarly, the Soul obtaining a new body, begins to manifest itself once more. The birth, growth and disappearance of the moon can all be directly apprehended by the eye. These phenomena, however, appertain to the gross form of that luminary. The like are not the attributes of the Soul. The moon, when it shows itself after its disappearance on the fifteenth day of the dark fortnight, is regarded as the same luminary that had become invisible. After the same manner, notwithstanding the changes <span id="p74"><sup><small>[ p. 74 ]</small></sup></span> represented by birth, growth and age, a person is regarded as the same individual without any doubt of his identity. It cannot be distinctly seen how Rahu approaches and leaves the moon. After the same manner, the Soul cannot be seen how it leaves one body and enters another. [^182] Rahu becomes visible only when it exists with the sun or the moon. Similarly, the Soul becomes an object of apprehension only when it exists with the body. When liberated from the sun or the moon, Rahu can no longer be seen. Similarly, the Soul, liberated from the body, can no longer be seen. Then again, as the moon, even when it disappears on the fifteenth day of the dark fortnight, is not deserted by the constellations and the stars, the Soul also, even though separated from the body, is not deserted by the fruits of the acts it has achieved in that body.’”


## SECTION CCIV

“Manu said, ‘As in a dream this manifest (body) lies (inactive) and the enlivening spirit in its subtile form, detaching itself from the former, walks forth after the same manner, in the state called deep slumber (or death), the subtile form with all the senses becomes inactive and the Understanding, detached from it remains awake. The same is the case with Existence and Non-Existence. [^183] As when quantity of water is clear, images reflected in it can be <span id="p75"><sup><small>[ p. 75 ]</small></sup></span> seen by the eye, after the same manner, if the senses be unperturbed, the Soul is capable of being viewed by the understanding. If, however, the quantity of water gets stirred, the person standing by it can no longer see those images. Similarly, if the senses become perturbed, the Soul can no longer be seen by the understanding. Ignorance begets Delusion. Delusion affects the mind. When the mind becomes vitiated, the five senses which have the mind for their refuge become vitiated also. Surcharged with Ignorance, and sunk in the mire of worldly objects, one cannot enjoy the sweets of contentment or tranquillity. The Soul (thus circumstanced), undetached from its good and evil acts, returns repeatedly unto the objects of the world, in consequence of sin one's thirst is never slaked. One's thirst is slaked only when one's sin is destroyed. In consequence of attachment to worldly objects, which has a tendency to perpetuate itself, one wishes for things other than those for which one should wish, and accordingly fails to attain to the Supreme. [^184] From the destruction of all sinful deeds, knowledge arises in men. Upon the appearance of Knowledge, one beholds one's Soul in one's understanding even as one sees one's own reflection in a polished mirror. One obtains misery in consequence of one's senses being unrestrained. One obtains happiness in consequence of one's senses being restrained. Therefore, one should restrain one's mind by self-effort from objects apprehended by the senses. [^185] Above the senses is the mind; above the mind is the understanding; above the understanding is the Soul; above the Soul is the Supreme or Great. From the Unmanifest hath sprung the Soul; from the Soul hath sprung the Understanding; from the Understanding hath sprung the Mind. When the Mind becomes associated with the senses, then it apprehends sound and the other objects of the senses. He who casts off those objects, as also all that are manifest, he who liberates himself from all things that arise from primordial matter, being so freed, enjoys immortality. [^186] The Sun rising diffuses his rays. When he sets, he withdraws unto himself those very rays that were diffused by him. After the same manner, the Soul, entering the body, obtains the fivefold objects of the senses by diffusing over them his rays represented by the senses. When, however, he turns back, he is said to set by withdrawing those rays unto himself. [^187] Repeatedly led along the path that is created by acts, he obtains the fruits of his acts in consequence of his having followed the practice of acts. [^188] Desire for the objects of the senses keeps away from a person who does not indulge in such desire. The very principle of desire, however, leaves him who has <span id="p76"><sup><small>[ p. 76 ]</small></sup></span> beheld his soul, which, of course, is entirely free from desire. [^189] When the Understanding, freed from attachment to the objects of the senses, becomes fixed in the mind, then does one succeed in attaining to _Brahma_, for it is there that the mind with the understanding withdrawn into it can possibly be extinguished. _Brahma_ is not an object of touch, or of hearing, or of taste, or of sight, or of smell, or of any deductive inference from the Known. Only the Understanding (when withdrawn from everything else) can attain to it. All objects that the mind apprehends through ‘the senses are capable of being withdrawn into the mind; the mind can be withdrawn into the understanding; the Understanding can be withdrawn into the Soul, and the Soul into the Supreme. [^190] The senses cannot contribute to the success of the mind. The mind cannot apprehend the Understanding. The Understanding cannot apprehend the manifested Soul. The Soul, however, which is subtile, beholds those all.’”


## SECTION CCV

“Manu said, ‘Upon the appearance of the physical and mental sorrow, one does not become able to practise _yoga_. It is advisable, therefore, for one not to brood over such sorrow. The remedy for sorrow is abstention from brooding over it. When sorrow is brooded over, it comes aggressively and increases in violence. One should relieve mental sorrow by wisdom, while physical sorrow should be cured by medicaments. Wisdom teaches this. One should not, while under sorrow, behave like a child. The man of wisdom should never cherish a desire for youth, beauty, length of life, accumulation of wealth, health, and the companionship of those that are dear, all of which are transitory. One should not grieve singly for a sorrow that affects a whole community. Without grieving, one should, if one sees an opportunity, seek to apply a remedy. Without doubt, the measure of sorrow is much greater than that of happiness in life. To one who is content with the objects of the senses, death that is disagreeable comes in consequence of his stupefaction. That man who avoids both sorrow and happiness succeeds verily in attaining to Brahma. Such persons, who are possessed of wisdom, have never to grieve. [^191] <span id="p77"><sup><small>[ p. 77 ]</small></sup></span> Worldly possessions bring about sorrow. In protecting them thou canst not have any happiness. They are again earned with misery. One should not therefore, regard their loss. [^192] Pure Knowledge (or Brahma) is regarded (by ignorance) as existing in the diverse forms that are objects of Knowledge. Know that mind is only an attribute of Knowledge. When the mind becomes united with the faculties of knowledge, then the Understanding (which bodies forth the forms of things) sets in. [^193] When the Understanding, freed from the attributes of action, becomes directed towards the mind (after being withdrawn from outward objects), then does it succeed in knowing _Brahma_ by meditation or _Yoga_ ending in complete absorption (_samadhi_)? The Understanding flowing from Ignorance, and possessed of the senses and attributes, runs towards external objects, like a river issuing from a mountain summit and flowing towards other regions. When the Understanding, withdrawn into the mind, succeeds in absorbing itself into contemplation that is free from attributes, it attains to a knowledge of Brahma like the touch of gold on a touchstone. The mind is the apprehender of the objects of the senses. It must first be extinguished (before Brahma can be attained). Dependent upon the attributes of objects that are before it, the mind can never show that which is without attributes. Shutting up all the doors constituted by the senses, the Understanding should be withdrawn into the mind. In this state, when absorbed in contemplation, it attains to the knowledge of Brahma. As the fivefold great creatures (in their gross form) upon the destruction of the attributes by which they are known, become withdrawn (into their subtile form called _Tanmatra_), after the same manner the Understanding may dwell in the mind alone, with the senses all withdrawn from their objects. When the Understanding, though possessed of the attribute of certainty, dwells in the mind, busied with the internal, even then it is nothing but the mind (without being anything superior to it). When the mind or consciousness, which attains to excellence through contemplation, succeeds in identifying attributes with what are considered as their possessors, then can it cast off all attributes and attain to Brahma which is without attributes. [^194] There is no indication that is fit enough for yielding a knowledge of what is Unmanifest (_Brahma_). That which cannot form the subject of language, cannot be acquired by any one. With cleansed soul, one should seek to approach the Supreme Brahma, through the aid afforded by penances, by inferences, by self-restraint, by the practices and observances as laid down for one's own order, and by the Vedas. Persons of clear vision (besides seeing the Supreme <span id="p78"><sup><small>[ p. 78 ]</small></sup></span> within themselves), seek him in even external forms by freeing themselves from attributes. The Supreme, which is called by the name of _Jneya_ (_i.e._, that which should be known), in consequence of the absence of all attributes or of its own nature, can never be apprehended by argument. When the Understanding becomes freed from attributes, then only it can attain to Brahma. When unemancipated from attributes, it falls back from the Supreme. Indeed, such is the nature of the understanding that it rushes towards attributes and moves among them like fire among fuel. As in the state called _Sushupti_ (deep and dreamless slumber) the five senses exist freed from their respective functions, after the same manner the Supreme Brahma exists high above _Prakriti_, freed from all its attributes. Embodied creatures thus betake themselves to action in consequence of attributes. When they abstain therefrom, they attain to Emancipation. Some again (by action) go to heaven. The living creature, primordial nature, the understanding, the objects of the senses, the senses, consciousness, conviction of personal identity, are called creatures (for they are subjected to destruction). The original creation of all these flowed from the Supreme. Their second or succeeding creation is due to the action of couples or pairs (of opposite sexes) and is confined to all things save the primal five, and is restrained by laws in consequence of which the same species produce the same species. From righteousness (living) creatures obtain a high end, and from sinfulness they earn an end that is low. He who is unemancipated from attachments, encounters rebirth; while he who is emancipated therefrom, attains to Knowledge (or Brahma).’”

“Manu said, ‘When the fivefold attributes are united with the five senses and the mind, then is Brahma seen by the individual like a thread passing through a gem. As a thread, again, may lie within gold or pearl or a coral or any object made of earth, even so one's soul, in consequence of one's own acts, may live within a cow, a horse, a man, an elephant, or any other animal, or within a worm or an insect. The good deeds an individual performs in a particular body produce rewards that the individual enjoys in that particular body. A soil, apparently drenched with one particular kind of liquid, supplies to each different kind of herb or plant that grows on it the sort of juice it requires for itself. After the same manner, the Understanding, whose course is witnessed by the soul, is obliged to follow the path marked out by the acts of previous lives. [^195] From knowledge springs desire. From desire springs resolution. From resolution flows action. From action proceed fruits (_i.e._, <span id="p79"><sup><small>[ p. 79 ]</small></sup></span> consequences, good and bad). Fruits, therefore, are dependent on actions as their cause. Actions have the understanding for their cause. The understanding has knowledge for its cause; and knowledge has the Soul for its cause. That excellent result which is achieved in consequence of the destruction of knowledge, of fruits, of the understanding, and of acts, is called Knowledge of Brahma. [^196] Great and high is that self-existent Essence, which yogins behold. They that are devoid of wisdom, and whose understandings are devoted to worldly possessions never behold that which exists in the Soul itself. Water is superior to the Earth in extension; Light is superior to Water; Wind is superior to Light; Space is superior to Wind; Mind is superior to Space; Understanding is superior to Mind; Time is superior to Understanding. The divine Vishnu, whose is this universe, is superior to Time. That god is without beginning, middle, and end. In consequence of his being without beginning, middle, and end, he is Unchangeable. He transcends all sorrow, for sorrow has limits. [^197] That Vishnu hath been called the Supreme Brahma. He is the refuge or object of what is called the Highest. Knowing Him, they that are wise, freed from everything that owns the power of Time, attain to what is called Emancipation. All these (that we perceive) are displayed in attributes. That which is called Brahma, being without attributes, is superior to these. [^198] Abstention from acts is the highest religion. That religion is sure to lead to deathlessness (Emancipation). The _Richs_, the _Yajuses_, and the _Samans_, have for their refuge the body. They flow from the end of the tongue. They cannot be acquired without effort and are subject to destruction. Brahma, however, cannot be acquired in this way, for (without depending upon the body) it depends upon that (_i.e._, the knower or Soul) which has the body for its refuge. Without beginning, middle, or end, Brahma cannot be acquired by exertion (like to what is necessary for the acquirement of the Vedas). The _Richs_, the _Samans_, the _Yajuses_ have each a beginning. Those that have a beginning have also an end. But Brahma is said to be without beginning. And because Brahma hath neither beginning nor end, it is said to be infinite and unchangeable. In consequence of unchangeableness, Brahma transcends all sorrow as also all pairs of opposites. Through unfavourable destiny, through inability to find out the proper means, and through the impediments offered by acts, mortals succeed not in beholding the path by which Brahma may be reached. In consequence of attachment to worldly possessions, of a vision of the joys of the highest heaven, and of <span id="p80"><sup><small>[ p. 80 ]</small></sup></span> coveting something other than Brahma, men do not attain to the Supreme. [^199] Others beholding worldly objects covet their possession. Desirous of such objects, they have no longing for Brahma in consequence of its transcending all attributes. [^200] How shall he that is attached to attributes which are inferior, arrive at a knowledge of him that is possessed of attributes that are superior? It is by inference that one can arrive at a knowledge of Him that transcends all this in attributes and form. By subtile intelligence alone can we know Him. We cannot describe Him in words. The mind is seizable by the mind, the eye by eye. [^201] By knowledge the understanding can be purified of its dross. The understanding may be employed for purifying the mind. By the mind should the senses be controlled. Achieving all this, one may attain to the Unchangeable. One who has, by contemplation, become freed from attachments, and who has been enriched by the possession of a discerning mind, succeeds in attaining to Brahma which is without desire and above all attributes. As the wind keeps away from the fire that is embedded within a piece of wood, even so persons that are agitated (by desire for worldly possessions) keep away from that which is Supreme. Upon the destruction of all earthly objects, the mind always attains to That which is higher than the Understanding; while upon their separation the mind always acquires that which is below the Understanding. That person, who, in conformity with the method already described, becomes engaged in destroying earthly objects, attains to absorption into the body of Brahma. [^202] Though the Soul is unmanifest; yet when clothed with qualities, its acts become unmanifest. When dissolution (of the body) comes, it once more becomes manifest. The Soul is really inactive. It exists, united with the senses that are productive of either happiness or sorrow. United with all the senses and endued with body, it takes refuge in the five primal elements. Through want of power, however, it fails to act when deprived of force by the Supreme and Unchangeable. No man sees the end of the earth but knows this, _viz_., that the earth's end Will <span id="p81"><sup><small>[ p. 81 ]</small></sup></span> surely come. [^203] Man, agitated here (by attachments), is surely led to his last refuge like the wind leading a vessel tossed on the sea to a safe harbour at last. The Sun, spreading his rays, becomes the possessor of an attribute, (_viz_., the lighter of the world): withdrawing his rays (at the hour of setting), he once more becomes an object divested of attributes. After the same manner, a person, abandoning all distinctions (attachments), and betaking himself to penances, at last enters the indestructible _Brahma_ which is divested of all attributes. By discerning Him who is without birth, who is the highest refuge of all righteous persons, who is self-born, from whom everything springs and unto whom all things return, who is unchangeable, who is without beginning, middle, and end, and who is certainty's self and supreme, a person attains to immortality (Emancipation).’”


## SECTION CCVII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘O grandsire, O thou of great wisdom, I desire to hear in detail, O chief of the Bharatas, of that lotus-eyed and indestructible one, who is the Creator of everything but who has been created by none, who is called Vishnu (in consequence of his pervading everything), who is the origin of all creatures and unto whom all creatures return, who is known by the names of Narayana and Hrishikesa and Govinda and Kesava, and who is incapable of being vanquished by any one.’

“Bhishma said, ‘I have heard of this subject from Jamadagni's son Rama, while he discoursed on it, from the celestial _Rishi_ Narada, and from Krishna-Dwaipayana. Asita-Devala, O son, Valmiki of austere penances, and Markandeya, speak of Govinda as the Most Wonderful and the Supreme. Kesava, O chief of Bharata's race, is the divine and puissant Lord of all. He is called _Purusha_, and pervades everything, having made himself many. Listen now, O Yudhishthira of mighty arms, to those attributes which great Brahmanas say are to be met with in the high-souled wielder of _Saranga_. I shall also, O prince of men, recite to thee those acts which persons conversant with old histories ascribe to Govinda. He is said to be the Soul of all creatures, the high-souled one, and the foremost of all beings. He created (by his will) the five-fold elements, _viz_., Wind, Light, Water, Space, and Earth. That puissant Lord of all things, that high-souled one, that foremost of all beings, having created the earth, laid himself down on the surface of the waters. While thus floating upon the waters, that foremost of all beings, that refuge of every kind of energy and splendour, created Consciousness, <span id="p82"><sup><small>[ p. 82 ]</small></sup></span> the first-born of beings in the universe. We have heard that He created Consciousness along with the Mind,—Consciousness which is the refuge of all created things. That Consciousness upholds all creatures and both the past and the future. After that great Being, O mighty-armed one, _viz_., Consciousness, had sprung, an exceedingly beautiful lotus, possessed of effulgence like the Sun's, grew out of the navel of the Supreme Being (floating on the waters). Then, O son, the illustrious and divine Brahman, the Grandsire of all creatures, sprang into existence from that lotus, irradiating all the points of the horizon with his effulgence. After the high-souled Grandsire had, O mighty-armed one, thus sprung from the primeval lotus, a great _Asura_ of the name of Madhu, having no beginning, started into birth, springing from the attribute or Darkness (_Tamas_). The foremost of all Beings, (_viz_., the Supreme Divinity), for benefiting Brahman, slew that fierce _Asura_ of fierce deeds, engaged even then in the fierce act (of slaying the Grand-sire). From this slaughter, O son, (of the _Asura_ named Madhu), all the gods and the _Danavas_ and men came to call that foremost of all righteous persons by the name of Madhusudana (slayer of Madhu). [^204] After this, Brahman created, by a flat of his will, seven sons with Daksha completing the tale. They were Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, (and the already mentioned Daksha). The eldest born, _viz_., Marichi, begat, by a fiat of his will, a son named Kasyapa, full of energy and the foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma. From his toe, Brahman had, even before the birth of Marichi, created a son. That son, O chief of Bharata's race, was Daksha, the progenitor of creatures. [^205] Unto Daksha were first born three and ten daughters, O Bharata, the eldest of whom was called Diti. Marichi's son Kasyapa, O sire, who was conversant with all duties and their distinctions, who was of righteous deeds and great fame, became the husband of those thirteen daughters. The highly-blessed Daksha (besides the three and ten already spoken of) next begat ten other daughters. The progenitor of creatures, _viz_., the righteous Daksha, bestowed these upon Dharma. Dharma became father of the Vasus, the Rudras of immeasurable energy, the Viswedevas, the Sadhyas, and the Maruts, O Bharata. Daksha next begat seven and twenty other younger daughters. The highly-blessed Soma became the husband of them all. The other wives of Kasyapa gave birth to Gandharvas, horses, birds, kine, Kimpurushas, fishes, and trees and plants. Aditi gave birth to the Adityas. the foremost ones among the gods, and possessed of great strength. Amongst them Vishnu took birth in the form of a dwarf. Otherwise called Govinda, he became the foremost of them all. Through his prowess, the prosperity of the gods increased. The _Danavas_ were vanquished. The offspring of Diti were the _Asuras_. Danu gave birth to the _Danavas_ having Viprachitti for their foremost. Diti gave birth to all the _Asuras_ of great strength.

“The slayer of Madhu also created the Day and the Night, and the Season in their order, and the Morn and the Even. After reflection, he also created the clouds, and all the (other) immobile and mobile objects. Possessed of abundant energy, he also created the Viswas and the earth with all things upon her. Then the highly blessed and puissant Krishna, O Yudhishthira, once again created from his mouth a century of foremost Brahmanas. From his two arms, he created a century of Kshatriyas, and from his thighs a century of Vaisyas. Then, O bull of Bharata's race, Kesava created from his two feet a century of Sudras. Possessed of great ascetic merit, the slayer of Madhu, having thus created the four orders of men, made Dhatri (Brahman) the lord and ruler of all created beings. Of immeasurable effulgence, Brahman became also the expositor of the knowledge of the Vedas. And Kesava made him, called Virupaksha, the ruler of the spirits and ghosts and of those female beings called the _Matrikas_ (mothers). And he made Yama the ruler of the _Pitris_ and of all sinful men. [^206] The Supreme Soul of all creatures also made Kuvera the lord of all treasures. He then created Varuna the lord of waters and governor of all aquatic animals. The puissant Vishnu made Vasava the chief of all the deities. In those times, men lived as long as they chose to live, and were without any fear of Yama. Sexual congress, O chief of the Bharatas, was then not necessary for perpetuating the species. In those days offspring were begotten by flat of the will. In the age that followed, _viz_., Treta, children were begotten by touch alone. The people of that age even, O monarch, were above the necessity of sexual congress. It was in the next age, _viz_., Dwapara, that the practice of sexual congress originated, O king, to prevail among men. In the Kali age, O monarch, men have come to marry and live in pairs.

“I have now told thee of the supreme Lord of all creatures. He is also called the Ruler of all and everything. I shall now, O son of Kunti, speak to thee about the sinful creatures of the earth. Listen to me. [^207] Those men, O king, are born in the southern region and are called Andrakas, Guhas, Pulindas, Savaras, Chuchukas, Madrakas. [^208] Those that are born in the northern region, I shall also mention. They are Yamas, Kamvojas, Gandharas, Kiratas and Barbaras. All of them, O sire, are sinful, and move on this Earth, characterised by practices similar to those of Chandalas and ravens and vultures. In the Krita age, O sire, they were nowhere on earth. It is from the Treta that they have had their origin and began to multiply, O chief of Bharata's race. When the terrible period came, joining Treta and <span id="p84"><sup><small>[ p. 84 ]</small></sup></span> the Dwapara, the Kshatriyas, approaching one another, engaged themselves in battle. [^209]

“Thus, O chief of Kuru's race, this universe was started into birth by the high-souled Krishna. That observer of all the worlds, _viz_., the celestial _Rishi_ Narada, has said that Krishna is the Supreme God. [^210] Even Narada, O king, admits the supremacy of Krishna and his eternity, O mighty-armed chief of Bharata's race. [^211] Thus, O mighty-armed one, is Kesava of unvanquishable prowess. That lotus-eyed one, is not a mere man. He is inconceivable.’”


## SECTION CCVIII

“Yudhishthira asked, ‘Who were the first _Prajapatis_, O bull of Bharata's race? What highly-blessed _Rishis_ are there in existence and on which points of the compass do each of them dwell?’

“Bhishma said., ‘Hear me, O chief of the Bharatas, about what thou askest me. I shall tell thee who the _Prajapatis_ were and what _Rishis_ are mentioned as dwelling on which point of the horizon. There was at first one Eternal, Divine, and Self-born Brahman. The Self-born Brahman begat seven illustrious sons. They were Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and the highly-blessed Vasishtha who was equal to the Self-born himself. These seven sons have been mentioned in the _Puranas_ as seven Brahmanas. I shall now mention all the _Prajapatis_ who came after these. In Atri's race was born the eternal and divine Varhi the ancient, who had penances for his origin. From Varhi the ancient sprang the ten _Prachetasas_. The ten _Prachetasas_ had one son between them, _viz_., the Prajapati called by the name of Daksha. This last has two names in the world, _viz_., Daksha and Kasyapa. Marichi had one son called Kasyapa. This last also has two names. Some call <span id="p85"><sup><small>[ p. 85 ]</small></sup></span> him Arishtanemi, and some Kasyapa. Atri had another son born of his lions, _viz_., the handsome and princely Soma of great energy. He performed penances for a thousand celestial _Yugas_. The divine Aryaman and they who were born unto him as his sons, O monarch, have been described as setters of commands, and creators of all creatures. Sasavindu had ten thousand wives. Upon each of them their lord begat a thousand sons, and so the tale reached ten hundred thousands. Those sons refused to call anybody else save themselves as _Prajapatis_. The ancient Brahmanas bestowed an appellation on the creatures of the world, derived from Sasavindu. That extensive race of the Prajapati Sasavindu became in time the progenitor of the Vrishni race. These that I have mentioned are noted as the illustrious _Prajapatis_. After this, I shall mention the deities that are the lords of the three worlds. Bhaga, Ansa, Aryyaman, Mitra, Varna, Savitri, Dhatri, Vivaswat of great might, Tvashtri, Pushan, Indra, and Vishnu known as the twelfth,—these are the twelve Adityas, all sprung from Kasyapa. Nasatya and Dasra are mentioned as the two Aswins. These two are the sons of the illustrious Martanda, the eighth in the above tale. These were called first the gods and the two classes of _Pitris_. Tvashtri had many sons. Amongst them were the handsome and famous Viswarupa, Ajaikapat, Ahi, Bradhna, Virupaksha, and Raivata. Then there were Hara and Vahurupa, Tryamvaka the chief of the Deities, and Savitrya, Jayanta and Pinaki the invincible. The highly-blessed Vasus, eight in number, have formerly been enumerated by me. These were reckoned as gods at the time of the Prajapati Manu. These were at first called the gods and the _Pitris_. Amongst the Siddhas and the Sadhyas there were two classes in consequence of conduct and youth. The deities were formerly considered to be of two classes, _viz_., the _Ribhus_ and the _Maruts_. Thus have the _Viswas_, the gods and the Aswins, been enumerated. Amongst them, the Adityas are Kshatriyas, and the Maruts are Vaisyas. The two Aswins, engaged in severe penances, have been said to be Sudras. The deities sprung from Angirasa's line have been said to be Brahmanas. This is certain. Thus have I told thee about the fourfold order among the gods. The person who, after rising from his bed at morn, recites the names of these deities, becomes cleansed of all his sins whether committed by himself intentionally or Unintentionally, or whether born of his intercourse with others. Yavakriti, Raivya, Arvavasu, Paravasu, Ausija, Kashivat, and Vala have been said to be the sons of Angiras. These, and Kanwa son of _Rishi_ Medhatithi, and Varhishada, and the well-known seven _Rishis_ who are the progenitors of the three worlds, all reside in the East. Unmucha, Vimucha, Svastyatreya of great energy, Pramucha, Idhmavaha, and the divine Dridhavrata, and Mitravaruna's son Agastya of great energy, these regenerate _Rishis_ all reside in the south. Upangu, Karusha, Dhaumya, Parivyadha of great energy, and those great _Rishis_ called Ekata, Dwita, and Trita, and Atri's son, _viz_., the illustrious and puissant Saraswata, these high-souled ones reside in the west. Atreya, and Vasishtha, and the great _Rishi_ Kasyapa, and Gautama, Bharadwaja, and Viswamitra, the son of Kusika, and the illustrious son of the high-souled Richika, _viz_., Jamadagni,—these seven live in the north. Thus have I told <span id="p86"><sup><small>[ p. 86 ]</small></sup></span> thee about the great _Rishis_ of fiery energy that live in the different points of the compass. Those high-souled ones are the witnesses of the universe, and are the creators of all the worlds. Even thus do they dwell in their respective quarters. By reciting their names one is cleansed of all one's sins. A person by repairing to those points becomes cleansed of all his sins and succeeds in returning home in safety'”


## SECTION CCIX

“Yudhishthira said, ‘O grandsire, O thou of great wisdom and invincible prowess in battle, I wish to hear in detail of Krishna who is immutable and omnipotent. O bull among men, tell me truly everything about his great energy and the great feats achieved by him in days of old. Why did that puissant one assume the form of an animal, and for achieving what particular act? Tell me all this, O mighty warrior!’

“Bhishma said, 

“The Grandsire said, ‘That is the Supreme God, the Creator of all beings, the soul of all creatures, the foremost of all _yogins_. Of huge body and great strength, he cometh here, having slain the foremost ones among the Danavas. He is the Lord of all beings, the master of _yoga_, the great ascetic, the Soul of all living beings. Be still, all of you. He is Krishna, the destroyer of all obstacles and impediments. [^213] That Supreme God, of immeasurable splendour, that great refuge of all blessings, having achieved a most difficult feat that is incapable of being accomplished by others, has returned to his own unmixed nature. [^214] It is He from whose navel the primeval lotus had sprung. He is the foremost of _yogins_. Of supreme soul, He is the creator of all beings. There is no need for sorrow or fear or grief, ye foremost of gods! He is the Ordainer. He is the Creating Principle. He is all-destroying Time. It is He who upholds <span id="p88"><sup><small>[ p. 88 ]</small></sup></span> all the world. The roars that have alarmed you are being uttered by that high-souled one. Of mighty arms, He is the object of the universal worship. Incapable of deterioration, that lotus-eyed one is the origin of all beings and their lord.’”


## SECTION CCX

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O sire, of that high yoga by which, O Bharata, I may obtain Emancipation, O foremost of speakers, I desire to know everything about that yoga truly.’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old narrative of the discourse between a preceptor and his disciple on the subject of Emancipation. There was a regenerate preceptor who was the foremost of _Rishis_. He looked like a mass of splendour. Possessed of a high soul, he was firm in truth and a complete master of his senses. Once on a time, a disciple of great intelligence and close attention, desirous of obtaining what was for his highest good, touched the preceptor's feet, and standing with joined hands before him, said, If, O illustrious one, thou hast been gratified with the worship I have offered thee, it behoveth thee to solve a great doubt of mine. Whence am I and whence art thou? Tell me this fully. Tell me also what is the final cause. Why also, O best of regenerate ones, when the material cause in all beings is the same, their origin and destruction happen in such dissimilar ways? It beseems thee, O thou of great learning, also to explain the object of the declarations in the Vedas (about difference of rites in respect of different classes of men), the meaning of the injunctions of the _Smritis_ and of those injunctions which apply to all cases of men.’ [^215]

“The preceptor said, ‘Listen, O disciple, O thou of great wisdom! This that thou hast asked me is undisclosed in the very Vedas and is the highest subject for thought or discourse. It is called _Adhyatma_ and is the most valuable of all branches of learning and of all sacred institutes. Vasudeva is the Supreme (cause) of the universe. He is the origin of the Vedas (_viz_., _Om_). He is Truth, Knowledge, Sacrifice, Renunciation, Self-restraint, and Righteousness. Persons conversant with the Vedas know Him as All-pervading, Eternal, Omnipresent, the Creator and the Destroyer, the Unmanifest, _Brahma_, Immutable. Hear now the story of Him who took his birth in Vrishni's race. A Brahmana should hear of the greatness of that God of gods, _viz_., Him called Vishnu of immeasurable energy, from the lips of Brahmanas. A person of the royal order should hear it from persons of that order. One who is a Vaisya should hear it from Vaisyas, and a high-souled Sudra should hear it from <span id="p89"><sup><small>[ p. 89 ]</small></sup></span> Sudras. Thou deservest to hear it. Listen now to the auspicious account of Krishna, that narrative which is the foremost of all narratives. Vasudeva is the wheel of Time, without beginning and without end. Existence and Non-existence are the attributes by which His real nature is known. The universe revolves like a wheel depending upon that Lord of all beings. O best of men, Kesava, that foremost of all beings, is said to be that which is Indestructible, that which is Unmanifest, that which is Immortal, Brahma, and Immutable. The highest of the high, and without change or deterioration himself, he created the _Pitris_, the gods, the _Rishis_, the _Yakshas_, the _Rakshasas_, the _Nagas_, the _Asuras_, and human beings. It is He who also created the Vedas and the eternal duties and customs of men. Having reduced everything into non-existence, he once more, in the beginning of a (new) yuga, creates Prakriti (primordial matter). As the diverse phenomena of the several seasons appear one after another according to the season that comes, after the like manner creatures start forth into existence at the beginning of every (celestial) yuga. Corresponding with those creatures that start into life is the knowledge of rules and duties that have for their object the regulation of the world's course. [^216] At the end of every (celestial) yuga (when universal destruction sets in) the Vedas and all other scriptures disappear (like the rest). In consequence of the grace of the Self-born, the great _Rishis_, through their penances, first re-acquire the lost Vedas and the scriptures. The Self-born (Brahman) first acquired the Vedas. Their branches called the _Angas_ were first acquired by (the celestial preceptor) Vrihaspati. Bhrigu's son (Sukra) first acquired the science of morality that is so beneficial for the universe. The science of music was acquired by Narada; that of arms by Bharadwaja; the history of the celestial _Rishis_ by Gargya: that of medicine by the dark-complexioned son of Atri. Diverse other _Rishis_, whose names are connected therewith, promulgated diverse other sciences such as Nyaya, Vaiseshika, Sankhya, Patanjala, etc. Let that Brahma which those _Rishis_ have indicated by arguments drawn from reason, by means of the Vedas, and by inferences drawn from the direct evidence of the senses, be adored., Neither the gods nor the _Rishis_ were (at first) able to apprehend Brahma which is without beginning and which is the highest of the high. Only the divine creator of all things, _viz_., the puissant Narayana, had knowledge of Brahma. From Narayana, the Rishis, the foremost ones among the deities and the _Asuras_, and the royal sages of old, derived the knowledge of that highest remedy of the cure of sorrow. When primordial matter produces existences through the action of the primal energy, the universe <span id="p90"><sup><small>[ p. 90 ]</small></sup></span> with all its potencies begins to flow from it. From one lighted lamp thousands of other lamps are capable of being lighted. After the same manner, primordial matter produces thousands of existent things. In consequence, again, of its infinity primordial matter is never exhausted. From the Unmanifest flows the Understanding determined by acts. The Understanding produces Consciousness. From Consciousness proceeds Space. From Space proceeds Wind. From the Wind proceeds Heat. From Heat proceeds Water, and from Water is produced the Earth. These eight constitute primordial _Prakriti_. The universe rests on them. From those Eight have originated the five organs of knowledge, the five organs of action, the five objects of the (first five) organs, and the one, _viz_., the Mind, forming the sixteenth, which is the result of their modification. The ear, the skin, the two eyes, the tongue, and the nose are the five organs of knowledge. The two feet, the lower duct, the organ of generation, the two arms, and speech, are the five organs of action. Sound, touch, form, taste, and smell are the five objects of the senses, covering all the things. The Mind dwells upon all the senses and their objects. In the perception of taste, it is the Mind that becomes the tongue, and in speech it is the Mind that becomes words. Endued with the different senses, it is the Mind that becomes all the objects that exist in its apprehension. These sixteen, existing in their respective forms, should be known as deities. These worship Him who creates all knowledge and dwells within the body. Taste is the attribute of water; scent is the attribute of earth; hearing is the attribute of space; vision is the attribute of fire or light; and touch should be known as the attribute of the wind. This is the case with all creatures at all times. The Mind, it has been said, is the attribute of existence. Existence springs from the Unmanifest (of _Prakriti_) which, every intelligent person should know, rests in That which is the Soul of all existent beings. These existences, resting upon the supreme Divinity that is above _Prakriti_ and that is without any inclination for action, uphold the entire universe of mobiles and immobiles. This sacred edifice of nine doors [^217] is endued with all these existences. That which is high above them, _viz_., the Soul, dwells within it, pervading it all over. For this reason, it is called _Purusha_. The Soul is without decay and not subject to death. It has knowledge of what is manifest and what is unmanifest. It is again all-pervading, possessed of attributes, subtile, and the refuge of all existences and attributes. As a lamp discovers all objects great or small (irrespective of its own size), after the same manner the Soul dwells in all creatures as the principle of knowledge (regardless of the attributes or accidents of those creatures). Urging the ear to hear what it hears, it is the Soul that hears. Similarly, employing the eye, it is the Soul that sees. This body furnishes the means by which the Soul derives knowledge. The bodily organs are not the doers, but it is the Soul that is the doer of all acts. There is fire in wood, but it can never be seen by cutting open a piece of wood. After the same manner, the Soul dwells within the body, but it can never be seen by dissecting the body. The fire that dwells in wood may be seen by <span id="p91"><sup><small>[ p. 91 ]</small></sup></span> employing proper means, _viz_., rubbing the wood with another piece of wood. After the same manner, the Soul which dwells within the body may be seen by employing proper means, _viz_., _yoga_. Water must exist in rivers. Rays of light are always attached to the sun. After the same manner, the Soul has a body. This connection does not cease because of the constant succession of bodies that the Soul has to enter. [^218] In a dream, the Soul, endued with the fivefold senses, leaves the body and roves over wide areas. After the same manner, when death ensues, the Soul (with the senses in their subtile forms) passes out of one body for entering another. The Soul is bound by its own former acts. Bound by its own acts done in one state of existence, it attains to another state. Indeed, it is led from one into another body by its own acts which are very powerful in respect of their consequences. How the owner of a human body, leaving off his body, enters another, and then again into another, how, indeed, the entire range of beings is the result of their respective acts (of past and present lives), I will presently tell you.’”

“Bhishma said, ‘All immobile and mobile beings, distributed into four classes, have been said to be of unmanifest birth and unmanifest death. Existing only in the unmanifest Soul, the Mind is said to possess the attributes of the unmanifest. [^219] As a vast tree is ensconced within a small unblown _Aswattha_ flower and becomes observable only when it comes out, even so birth takes place from what is unmanifest. A piece of iron, which is inanimate, runs towards a piece of loadstone. Similarly, inclinations and propensities due to natural instincts, and all else, run towards the Soul in a new life. [^220] Indeed, even as those propensities and possessions born of Ignorance and Delusion, and inanimate in respect of their nature, are united with Soul when reborn, <span id="p92"><sup><small>[ p. 92 ]</small></sup></span> after the same manner, those other propensities and aspirations of the Soul that have their gaze directed towards Brahma become united with it, coming to it directly from Brahma itself. [^221] Neither earth, nor sky, nor heaven, nor things, nor the vital breaths, nor virtue and vice, nor anything else, existed before, save the Chit-Soul. Nor have they any necessary connection with even the Chit-Soul defiled by Ignorance. [^222] The Soul is eternal. It is indestructible. It occurs in every creature. It is the cause of the Mind. It is without attributes, This universe that we perceive hath been declared (in the Vedas) to be due to Ignorance or Delusion. The Soul's apprehensions of form, etc., are due to past desires. [^223] The Soul, when it becomes endued with those causes (_viz_., desire), is led to the state of its being engaged in acts. In consequence of that condition (for those acts again produce desires to end in acts anew and so on),—this vast wheel to existence revolves, without beginning and without <span id="p93"><sup><small>[ p. 93 ]</small></sup></span> end. [^224] The Unmanifest, _viz_., the Understanding (with the desires), is the nave of that wheel. The Manifest (_i.e._, the body with the senses) constitutes its assemblage of spokes, the perceptions and acts from its circumference. Propelled by the quality of _Rajas_ (Passion), the Soul presides over it (witnessing its revolutions). Like oilmen pressing oilseeds in their machine, the consequences born of Ignorance, assailing the universe (of creatures) which is moistened by Rajas, press or grind it in that wheel. In that succession of existences, the living creature, seized by the idea of Self in consequence of desire, engages itself in acts. In the union of cause and effect, those acts again become (new causes). [^225] Effects do not enter into causes. Nor do causes enter into effects. In the production of effects, Time is the Cause. The primordial essences (eight in number as mentioned before), and their modifications six-(teen in number), fraught with causes, exists in a state of union, in consequence of their being always presided over by the Soul. Like dust following the wind that moves it, the creature-Soul, divested of body, but endued still with inclinations born of Passion and Darkness and with principles of causes constituted by the acts of the life that is over, moves on, following the direction that the Supreme Soul gives it. The Soul, however, is never touched by those inclinations and propensities. Nor are these touched by the Soul that is superior to them. The wind, which is naturally pure, is never stained by the dust it bears away. [^226] As the wind is truly separate from the dust it bears away, even so, the man of wisdom should know, is the connection between that which is called existence or life and the Soul. No one should take it that the Soul, in consequence of its apparent union with the body and the senses and the other propensities and beliefs and unbeliefs, is really endued therewith as its necessary and absolute qualities. On the other hand, the Soul should be taken as existing in its own nature. Thus did the divine _Rishi_ solve the doubt that had taken possession of his disciple's mind. Notwithstanding all this, people depend upon means consisting of acts and scriptural rites for casting off misery and winning happiness. Seeds that are scorched by fire do not put forth sprouts. After the same manner, if everything that contributes to misery be consumed by the fire of true knowledge, the Soul escapes the obligation of rebirth in the world.’

## SECTION CCXII

“Bhishma said, ‘Persons engaged in the practice of acts regard the practice of acts highly. Similarly, those that are devoted to Knowledge do not regard anything other than Knowledge. Persons fully conversant with the Vedas and depending upon the utterances contained in them, are rare. They that are more intelligent desire the path of abstention from acts as the better of the two, _viz_., heaven and emancipation. [^227] Abstention from acts is observed by those that are possessed of great wisdom. That conduct, therefore, is laudable. The intelligence which urges to abstention from acts, is that by which one attains to Emancipation. Possessed of body, a person, through folly, and endued with wrath and cupidity and all the propensities born of Passion and Darkness, becomes attached to all earthly objects. One, therefore, who desires to destroy one's connection with the body, should never indulge in any impure act. On the other hand, one should create by one's acts a path for attaining to emancipation, without wishing for regions of felicity (in the next world). [^228] As gold, when united with iron, loses its purity and fails to shine, even so Knowledge, when existing with attachment to earthly objects and such other faults, fails to put forth its splendour. [^229] He who, influenced by cupidity and following the dictates of desire and wrath, practises unrighteousness, transgressing the path of righteousness, meets with complete destruction. [^230] One who is desirous of benefiting oneself should never follow, with excess of attachments, earthly possessions represented by the objects of the senses. If one does it, wrath and joy—and sorrow arise from one another (and make one miserable). When every one's body is made up of the five original elements as also of the three attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, whom shall one adore and whom shall one blame with what words? Only they that are fools become attached to the objects of the senses. In consequence of folly they do not know that their bodies are only modifications. [^231]

<span id="p95"><sup><small>[ p. 95 ]</small></sup></span>

As a house made of earth is plastered over with earth, even so this body which is made of earth is kept from destruction by food which is only a modification of earth. Honey and oil and milk and butter and meat and salt and treacle and grain of all kinds and fruit and roots are all modifications of earth and water. Recluses living in the wilderness, giving up all longing (for rich and savoury food), take simple food, that is again unsavoury, for only supporting the body. After the same manner, a person that dwells in the wilderness of the world, should be ready for labour and should take food for passing through life, like a patient taking medicine. [^232] A person of noble soul, examining all things of an earthly nature that come upon him, by the aid of truth, purity, candour, a spirit of renunciation, enlightenment, courage, forgiveness, fortitude, intelligence, reflection, and austerities, and desirous of obtaining tranquillity, should restrain his senses. All creatures, stupefied, in consequence of Ignorance, by the attributes of Goodness and Passion and Darkness, are continually revolving like a wheel. All faults, therefore, that are born of Ignorance, should be closely examined and the idea of Self which has its origin in Ignorance, and which is productive of misery, should be avoided. The fivefold elements, the senses, the attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, the three worlds with the Supreme Being himself, and acts, all rest on Self-consciousness. [^233] As Time, under its own laws, always displays the phenomena of the seasons one after another, even so one should know that Consciousness in all creatures is the inducer of acts. [^234] _Tamas_ (from which proceeds Consciousness) should be known as productive of delusions. It is like Darkness and is born of Ignorance. To the three attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness are attached all the joys and sorrows (of creatures). Listen now to those consequences that spring from the attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness. Contentment, the satisfaction that arises from joy, certainty, intelligence, and memory,—these are the consequences born of the attribute of Goodness. I shall now mention the consequences of Passion and Darkness. Desire, wrath, error, cupidity, stupefaction, fear, and fatigue, belong to the attribute of Passion. Cheerlessness, grief, discontent, vanity, pride, and wickedness, all belong to Darkness. Examining the gravity or lightness of these and other faults that dwell in the Soul, one should reflect upon each of them one after another (for ascertaining which of them exist, which have become strong or weak, which have been driven off, and which remain).’

<span id="p96"><sup><small>[ p. 96 ]</small></sup></span>

“Yudhishthira said, ‘What faults are abandoned by persons desirous of Emancipation? What are those that are weakened by them? What are the faults that come repeatedly (and are, therefore, incapable of being got rid of)? What, again, are regarded as weak, through stupefaction (and, therefore, as permissible)? What, indeed, are those faults upon whose strength and weakness a wise man should reflect with the aid of intelligence and of reasons? I have doubts upon these subjects. Discourse to me on these, O grandsire!’

“Bhishma said, ‘A person of pure Soul, by extracting all his faults by their roots, succeeds in obtaining Emancipation. As an axe made of steel cuts a steel chain (and accomplishing the act becomes broken itself), after the same manner, a person of cleansed Soul, destroying all the faults that spring from Darkness and that are born with the Soul (when it is reborn), succeeds in dissolving his connection with the body (and attaining Emancipation). [^235] The qualities having their origin in Passion, those that spring from Darkness, and those stainless one characterised by purity (_viz_., those included under the quality of Goodness), constitute as it were the seed from which all embodied creatures have grown. Amongst these, the attribute of Goodness alone is the cause through which persons of cleansed Souls succeed in attaining to Emancipation. A person of cleansed soul, therefore, should abandon all the qualities born of Passion and Darkness. Then again, when the quality of Goodness becomes freed from those of Passion and Darkness, it becomes more resplendent still. Some say that sacrifices and other acts performed with the aid of _mantras_, and which certainly contribute to the purification of the Soul, are evil or cruel acts. (This view is not correct). On the other hand, those acts are the chief means for dissociating the Soul from all worldly attachments, and for the observance of the religion of tranquillity. Through the influence of the qualities born of Passion, all unrighteous acts are performed, and all acts fraught with earthly purposes as also all such acts as spring from desire are accomplished. Through qualities born of Darkness, one does all acts fraught with cupidity and springing from wrath. In consequence of the attribute of Darkness, one embraces sleep and procrastination and becomes addicted to all acts of cruelty and carnal pleasure. That person, however, who, possessed of faith and scriptural knowledge, is observant of the attribute of Goodness, attends only to all good things, and becomes endued with (moral) beauty and soul free from every taint.’


## SECTION CCXIII

“Bhishma said, ‘From the attribute of Passion arises delusion or loss of judgment. From the attribute of Darkness, O bull of Bharata's race, arise <span id="p97"><sup><small>[ p. 97 ]</small></sup></span> wrath and cupidity and fear and pride. When all these are destroyed, one becomes pure. By obtaining purity, a person succeeds in arriving at the knowledge of the Supreme Soul which is resplendent with effulgence, incapable of deterioration, without change, pervading all things, having the unmanifest for his refuge, and the foremost of all the deities. Invested in His _maya_, men fall away from knowledge and become senseless, and in consequence of their knowledge being darkened, yield to wrath. [^236] From wrath, they become subject to desire. From desire spring cupidity and delusion and vanity and pride and selfishness. From such selfishness proceeds various kinds of acts. [^237] From acts spring diverse bonds of affection and from those bonds of affection spring sorrow or misery and from acts fraught with joy and sorrow proceeds the liability to birth and death. [^238] In consequence of the obligation of birth, the liability is incurred of a residence within the womb, due to the union of vital seed and blood. That residence is defiled with excreta and urine and phlegm, and always fouled with blood that is generated there. Overwhelmed by thirst, the Chit-Soul becomes bound by wrath and the rest that have been enumerated above. It seeks, however, to escape those evils. In respect of this, women must be regarded as instruments which set the stream of Creation agoing. By their nature, women are _Kshetra_, and men are _Kshetrajna_ in respect of attributes. For this reason, persons of wisdom should not pursue women in especial (among other objects of the world). [^239] Indeed, women are like frightful _mantra_\-powers. They stupefy persons reft of wisdom. They are sunk in the attribute of Passion. They are the eternal embodiment of the senses. [^240] <span id="p98"><sup><small>[ p. 98 ]</small></sup></span> In consequence of the keen desire that men entertain for women, off-spring proceed from them, due to (the action of) the vital seed. As one casts off from one's body such vermin as take their birth there but as are not on that account any part of oneself, even so should one cast off those vermin of one's body that are called children, who, though regarded as one's own, are not one's own in reality. From the vital seed as from sweat (and other filth) creatures spring from the body, influenced by the acts of previous lives or in the course of nature. Therefore, one possessed of wisdom should feel no regard for them. [^241] The attribute of Passion rests on that of Darkness. The attribute of Goodness, again, rests on that of Passion. Darkness which is unmanifest overspreads itself on Knowledge, and causes the phenomena of Intelligence and Consciousness. [^242] That knowledge possessing the attributes of Intelligence and Consciousness has been said to be the seed of embodied Souls. That, again, which is the seed of such knowledge is called the _Jiva_ (or _Chit_\-Soul). [^243] In consequence of acts and the virtue of time, the Soul goes through birth and repeated rounds of rebirth. As in a dream the Soul sports as if invested with a body which, of course, is due to the action of the mind, after the same manner, it obtains in the mother's womb a body in consequence of attributes and propensities having (past) acts for their origin. Whatever senses while it is there, are awakened by past acts as the operating cause, become generated <span id="p99"><sup><small>[ p. 99 ]</small></sup></span> in Consciousness in consequence of the mind co-existing with attachments. [^244] In consequence of the past thoughts of sound that are awakened in it, the Soul, subjected to such influences, receives the organ of hearing. Similarly, from attachment to forms, its eye is produced, and from its longing after scent its organ of smelling. From thoughts of touch it acquires the skin. In the same way the five-fold breaths are acquired by it, _viz_., _Prana_, _Apana_, _Vyana_, _Udana_, and _Samana_, which contribute to keep the body agoing. Encased in body with all limbs fully developed in consequence (as shown above) of past acts, the Soul takes birth, with sorrow, both physical and mental, in the beginning, middle, and end. It should be known that sorrow springs from the very fact of acceptance of body (in the womb). It increases with the idea of Self. From renunciation of these (attachments which are the cause of birth), sorrow meets with an end. He that is conversant with sorrow's end attains to Emancipation. [^245] Both the origin and the destruction of the senses rest in the attribute of Passion. The man of wisdom should act with proper scrutiny with the aid of the eye constituted by the scriptures. [^246] The senses of knowledge, even if they succeed in earning all their objects, never succeed in overwhelming the man that is without thirst. The embodied Soul, by making its senses weak, escapes the obligation or rebirth.’” [^247]

## SECTION CCXIV

“Bhishma said, ‘I shall now tell thee what the means are (for conquering the senses) as seen with the eye of the scriptures. A person, O king, will attain to the highest end by the help of such knowledge and by framing his conduct accordingly. Amongst all living creatures man is said to be the foremost.

Among men, those that are regenerate have been called the foremost; and amongst the regenerate, they that are conversant with the Vedas. These last are regarded as the souls of all living creatures. Indeed, those Brahmanas <span id="p100"><sup><small>[ p. 100 ]</small></sup></span> that are conversant with the Vedas are regarded as all-seeing and omniscient. They are persons who have become conversant with Brahma. As a blind man, without a guide, encounters many difficulties on a road, so has a person destitute of knowledge to encounter many obstacles in the world. For this reason, those that are possessed of knowledge are regarded as superior to the rest. Those that are desirous of acquiring virtue practise diverse kinds of rites according to the dictates of the scriptures. They do not, however, succeed in attaining to Emancipation, all that they gain being those good qualities of which I shall presently speak. [^248] Purity of speech, of body, and of mind, forgiveness, truth, steadiness, and intelligence,—these good qualities are displayed by righteous persons observant of both kinds of religion. That which is called _Brahmacharya_ (religion of abstention or _yoga_) is regarded as the means of attaining to Brahma. That is the foremost of all religions. It is by the practice of that religion that one obtains the highest end (_viz_., Emancipation). _Brahmacharya_ is divested of all connection with the five vital breaths, mind, understanding, the five senses of perception, and the five senses of action. It is on that account free from all the perceptions that the senses give. It is heard only as a word, and its form, without being seen, can only be conceived. It is a state of existence depending only on the mind. It is free from all connection with the senses. That sinless state should be attained to by the understanding alone. He that practises it duly attains to Brahma; he that practises it half and half, attains to the condition of the gods; while he that practises it indifferently, takes birth among Brahmanas and possessed of learning attains to eminence. _Brahmacharya_ is exceedingly difficult to practise. Listen now to the means (by which one may practise it). That regenerate person who betakes himself to it should subdue the quality of Passion as soon as it begins to manifest itself or as soon as it begins to be powerful. One that has betaken oneself to that vow should not speak with women. He should never cast his eyes on an undressed woman. The sight of women, under even indifferent circumstances, fills all weak-minded men with Passion. If a person (while observing this vow) feels a desire for woman rising in his heart, he should (as an expiation) observe the vow called _Krichcchra_ and also pass three days in water. [^249] If desire is entertained in course of a dream, one should, diving in water, mentally repeat for three times the three _Riks_ by _Aghamarshana_. [^250] That wise man who has betaken himself to the practice of this vow should, with an extended and enlightened <span id="p101"><sup><small>[ p. 101 ]</small></sup></span> mind, burn the sins in his mind which are all due to the quality of Passion. As the duct that bears away the refuse of the body is very closely connected with the body, even so the embodied Soul is very closely connected with the body that confines it. The different kinds of juices, passing through the network of arteries, nourish men's wind and bile and phlegm, blood and skin and flesh, intestines and bones and marrow, and the whole body. Know that there are ten principal ducts. These assist the functions of the five senses. From those ten branch out thousands of other ducts that are minuter in form. Like rivers filling the ocean at the proper season, all these ducts, containing juices nourish the body. Leading to the heart there is a duct called _Manovaha_. It draws from every part of the human body the vital seed which is born of desire. Numerous other ducts branching out from that principal one extend into every part of the body and bearing the element of heat cause the sense of vision (and the rest). As the butter that lies within milk is churned up by churning rods, even so the desires that are generated in the mind (by the sight or thought of women) draw together the vital seed that lies within the body. In the midst of even our dreams passion having birth in imagination assails the mind, with the result that the duct already named, _viz_., _Manovaha_, throws out the vital seed born of desire. The great and divine _Rishi_ Atri is well-conversant with the subject of the generation of the vital seed. The juices that are yielded by food, the duct called _Manovaha_, and the desire that is born of imagination,—these three are the causes that originate the vital seed which has Indra for its presiding deity. The passion that aids in the emission of this fluid is, therefore, called _Indriya_. Those persons who know that the course of vital seed is the cause of (that sinful state of things called) intermixture of castes, are men of restrained passions. Their sins are regarded to have been burnt off, and they are never subjected to rebirth. He that betakes himself to action simply for the purposes of sustaining his body, reducing with the aid of the mind the (three) attributes (of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness) into a state of uniformity, and brings at his last moments the vital breaths to the duct called _Manovaha_, escapes the obligation of rebirth. [^251] The Mind is sure to gain Knowledge. It is the Mind that takes the form of all things. The minds of all high-souled persons, attaining to success through meditation, <span id="p102"><sup><small>[ p. 102 ]</small></sup></span> become freed from desire, eternal, and luminous. [^252] Therefore, for destroying the mind (as mind), one should do only sinless deeds and freeing oneself from the attributes of Passion and Darkness, one is sure to attain to an end that is very desirable. [^253] Knowledge (ordinarily) acquired in younger days becomes weakened with decrepitude. A person, however, of ripe understanding succeeds, through the auspicious effects of past lives, in destroying his desires. [^254] Such a person, by transcending the bonds of the body and the senses like a traveller crossing a path full of obstacles, and transgressing all faults he sees, succeeds in tasting the nectar (of Emancipation).’”


## SECTION CCXV

“Bhishma said, ‘Living creatures, by being attached to objects of the senses which are always fraught with evil, become helpless. Those high-souled persons, however, who are not attached to them, attain to the highest end. The man of intelligence, beholding the world over-whelmed with the evils constituted by birth, death, decrepitude, sorrow, disease, and anxieties, should exert themselves for the attainment of Emancipation. He should be pure in speech, thought, and body; he should be free from pride. Of tranquil soul and possessed of knowledge, he should lead a life of mendicancy, and pursue happiness without being attached to any worldly object. Again, if attachment be seen to possess the mind in consequence of compassion to creatures, he should, seeing that the universe is the result of acts, show <span id="p103"><sup><small>[ p. 103 ]</small></sup></span> indifference in respect of compassion itself. [^255] Whatever good, acts are performed, or whatever sin (is perpetrated), the doer tastes the consequences. Hence, one should, in speech, thought, and deed, do only acts that are good. [^256] He succeeds in obtaining happiness who practises abstention from injuring (others), truthfulness of speech, honesty towards all creatures, and forgiveness, and who is never heedless. Hence one, exercising one's intelligence, should dispose one's mind, after training it, on peace towards all creatures. [^257] That man who regards the practice of the virtues enumerated above as the highest duty, as conducive to the happiness of all creatures, and as destructive of all kinds of sorrow, is possessed of the highest knowledge, and succeeds in obtaining happiness. Hence (as already said), one should, exercising one's intelligence, dispose one's mind, after training it, on peace towards all creatures. One should never think of doing evil to others. One should not covet what is far above one's power to attain. One should not turn one's thoughts towards objects that are non-existent. One should, on the other hand, direct one's mind towards knowledge by such persistent efforts as are sure to succeed. [^258] With the aid of the declarations of the _Srutis_ and of persistent efforts calculated to bring success, that Knowledge is sure to flow. One that is desirous of saying good words or observing a religion that is refined of all dross, should utter only truth that is not fraught with any malice or censure. One that is possessed of a sound heart should utter words that are not fraught with dishonesty, that are not harsh, that are not cruel, that are not evil, and that are not characterised by garrulity. The universe is bound in speech. If disposed to renunciation (of all worldly objects) then should one proclaim, [^259] which a mind fraught with humility and a cleansed understanding, one's own evil acts. [^260] He who betakes himself to action, impelled thereto by propensities fraught with the attribute of Passion, obtains much misery in this world and at last sinks into hell. One should, therefore, practise <span id="p104"><sup><small>[ p. 104 ]</small></sup></span> self-restraint in body, speech, and mind. Ignorant persons bearing the burdens of the world are like robbers laden with their booty of straggling sheep (secreted from herds taken out for pasture). The latter are always regardful of roads that are unfavourable to them (owing to the presence of the king's watch). [^261] Indeed, as robbers have to throw away their spoil if they wish for safety, even so should a person cast off all acts dictated by Passion and Darkness if he is to obtain felicity. Without doubt, a person that is without desire, free from the bonds of the world, contented to live in solitude, abstemious in diet, devoted to penances and with senses under control, that has burnt all his sorrows by (the acquisition of) knowledge, that takes a pleasure in practising all the particulars of _yoga_ discipline, and that has a cleansed soul, succeeds, in consequence of his mind being withdrawn into itself, in attaining to Brahma or Emancipation. [^262] One endued with patience and a cleansed soul, should, without doubt, control one's understanding. With the understanding (thus disciplined), one should next control one's mind, and then with the mind overpower the objects of the senses. Upon the mind being thus brought under control and the senses being all subdued, the senses will become luminous and gladly enter into Brahma. When one's senses are withdrawn into the mind, the result that occurs is that Brahma becomes manifested in it. Indeed, when the senses are destroyed., and the soul returns to the attribute of pure existence, it comes to be regarded as transformed into Brahma. Then again, one should never make a display of one's _yoga_ power. On the other hand, one should always exert to restrain one's senses by practising the rules of _yoga_. Indeed, one engaged in the practice of _yoga_ rules should do all those acts by which one's conduct and disposition may become pure. [^263] (Without making one's yoga powers the means of one's subsistence) one should rather live upon broken grains of corn, ripe beans, dry cakes of seeds from which the oil has been pressed out, pot-herbs, half-ripe barley, flour of fried pulses, fruits, and roots, obtained in alms. [^264] Reflecting upon the characteristics of time and place, one should according to one's inclinations observe, after proper examination, vows and rules about fasts. One should not suspend an observance that has been begun. Like one slowly creating a fire, one should gradually extend an act that is prompted by knowledge. By doing so, Brahma gradually shines in one like the Sun. The Ignorance which has Knowledge for its resting ground, extends its influence over all the three states (of waking, dreaming and dreamless slumber). The <span id="p105"><sup><small>[ p. 105 ]</small></sup></span> Knowledge, again, that follows the Understanding, is assailed by Ignorance. [^265] The evil-hearted person fails to obtain a knowledge of the Soul in consequence of taking it as united with the three states although in reality it transcends them all. When, however, he succeeds in apprehending the limits under which the two, _viz_., union with the three states and separation from them, are manifested, it is then that he becomes divested of attachment and attains to Emancipation. When such an apprehension has been attained, one transcends the effects of age, rises superior to the consequences of decrepitude and death, and obtains Brahma which is eternal, deathless, immutable, undeteriorating.’”

## SECTION CCXVI

“Bhishma said, ‘The _yogin_ who wishes to always practise sinless _Brahmacharya_ and who is impressed with the faults attaching to dreams should, with his whole heart, seek to abandon sleep. In dreams, the embodied soul, affected by the attributes of Passion and Darkness, seems to become possessed of another body and move and act influenced by desire. [^266] In consequence of application for the acquisition of knowledge and of continued reflection and recapitulation, the _yogin_ remains always awake. Indeed, the _yogin_ can keep himself continually awake by devoting himself to knowledge. On this topic it has been asked what is this state in which the embodied creature thinks himself surrounded by and engaged in objects and acts? True it is that the embodied being, with its senses really suspended, still thinks itself to be possessed of body with all the senses of knowledge and of action. As regards the question started, it is said that that master of _yoga_, named Hari, comprehends truly how it happens. The great _Rishis_ say that the explanation offered by Hari is correct and consistent with reason. The learned say that it is in consequence of the senses being worn out with fatigue, dreams are experienced by all creatures. (Though the senses are suspended) the mind, however, never disappears (or becomes inactive) and hence arise dreams. This is said by all to be their noted cause. As the imaginings of a person that is awake and <span id="p106"><sup><small>[ p. 106 ]</small></sup></span> engaged in acts, are due only to the creative power of the mind, after the same manner the impressions in a dream appertain only to the mind. A person with desire and attachment obtains those imaginings (in dreams) based upon the impressions of countless lives in the past. Nothing that impresses the mind once is ever lost, and the Soul being cognisant of all those impressions causes them to come forth from obscurity. [^267] Whichever among the three attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness is brought about by the influence of past acts and by whichever amongst them the mind is affected for the time being in whatever way, the elements (in their subtile forms) display or indicate accordingly (in the way of images). [^268] After images have thus been produced, the particular attribute of Goodness or Passion or Darkness that may have been brought by past act rises in the mind and conduces to its last result, _viz_., happiness or misery. Those images having wind, bile, and phlegm for their chief causes, which men apprehend through ignorance and in consequence of propensities fraught with Passion and Darkness, cannot, it has been said, be easily discarded. [^269] Whatever objects again a person perceives in the mind (while wakeful) through the senses in a state of perspicuity are apprehended by the mind in dreams while the senses are obscured in respect of their functions. [^270] The Mind exists unobstructedly in all things. This is due to the nature of the Soul. The Soul should be comprehended. All the elements and the objects they compose exist in the Soul. [^271] In the state called dreamless slumber (_sushupti_), the manifest human body which, of course, is the door of dreams, disappears in the mind. Occupying the body the mind enters the soul which is manifest and upon which all existent and non-existent things depend, and becomes transformed into a wakeful witness with certainty of apprehension. Thus dwelling in pure Consciousness which is the soul of all things; it is regarded by the learned as <span id="p107"><sup><small>[ p. 107 ]</small></sup></span> transcending both Consciousness and all things in the universe. [^272] That _yogin_ who in consequence of desire covets any of the divine attributes (of Knowledge or Renunciation, etc.) should regard a pure mind to be identical with the object of his desire. All things rest in a pure mind or soul. [^273] This is the result attained to by one who is engaged in penances. That yogin, however, who has crossed Darkness or ignorance, becomes possessed of transcending effulgence. When darkness or ignorance has been transcended, the embodied Soul becomes Supreme _Brahma_, the cause of the universe. [^274] The deities have penances and Vedic rites. Darkness (or pride and cruelty), which is destructive of the former, has been adopted by the _Asuras_. This, _viz_., _Brahma_, which has been said to have Knowledge only for its attribute, is difficult of attainment by either the deities or the _Asuras_. It should be known that the qualities of Goodness, Passion and Darkness belong to the deities and the _Asuras_. Goodness is the attribute of the deities; while the two others belong to the _Asuras_. _Brahma_ transcends all those attributes. It is pure Knowledge. It is Deathlessness. It is pure effulgence. It is undeteriorating. Those persons of cleansed souls who know _Brahma_ attain to the highest end. One having knowledge for one's eye can say this much with the aid of reason and analogy. _Brahma_ which is indestructible can be comprehended by only withdrawing the senses and the mind (from external objects into the soul itself).’” [^275]

“Bhishma said, ‘He cannot be said to know _Brahma_ who does not know the four topics (_viz_., dreams, dreamless slumber, Brahma as indicated by attributes, and Brahma as transcending all attributes), as also what is Manifest (_viz_., the body), and what is Unmanifest (the _chit_\-soul), which the great _Rishi_  <span id="p108"><sup><small>[ p. 108 ]</small></sup></span> (Narayana) has described as Tattwam. [^276] That which is manifest should be known as liable to death. That which is unmanifest (_viz_., the _chit_\-soul), should be known as transcending death. The _Rishi_ Narayana has described the religion of Pravritti. Upon that rests the whole universe with its mobile and immobile creatures. The religion of Nivritti again leads to the unmanifest and eternal Brahma. [^277] The Creator (Brahma) has described the religion of Pravritti. Pravritti implies rebirth or return. Nivritti, on the other hand, implies the highest end. The ascetic who desires to discriminate with exactitude between good and evil, who is always bent on understanding the nature of the Soul, and who devotes himself to the religion of Nivritti, attains to that high end. [^278] One desirous of accomplishing this, should know both the Unmanifest and Purusha of which I shall speak presently. That, again, which is different from both the Unmanifest and Purusha, and which transcends them both, and which is distinguished from all beings, should be particularly viewed by one possessed of intelligence. [^279] Both Prakriti and Purusha are without beginning and without end. Both are incapable of being known by their like. Both are eternal and indestructible. Both are greater than the greatest (of being). In these they are similar. They are points of dissimilarity again between them. (Of these I shall speak presently). Prakriti is fraught with the three attributes (of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness). It is also engaged in creation. The true attributes of Kshetrajna (Purusha or the Soul) should be known to be different. [^280] Purusha is the apprehender of all the transformations of Prakriti (but cannot be apprehended himself). He transcends (in respect of his original nature) all attributes. As regards Purusha and the Supreme Soul again, both of them are in-comprehensible. In consequence again of both of them being without attributes by which they can be distinguished, both are highly distinguished from all else. [^281] A turbaned person has his head circled with three folds of a piece of cloth. (The person, however, is not identical with the turban he wears). After the same manner the embodied Soul is invested with the three attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness. But though thus invested, the Soul is not <span id="p109"><sup><small>[ p. 109 ]</small></sup></span> identical with those attributes. Hence these four topics, which are covered by these fourfold considerations, should be understood. [^282] One who understands all this is never stupefied when one has to draw conclusions (in respect of all subjects of enquiry). He that is desirous of attaining to high prosperity should become pure in mind, and betaking himself to austere practices in respect of the body and the senses, should devote himself to yoga without desire of fruits. The universe is pervaded by yoga power secretly circulating through every part of it and illumining it brightly. The sun and the moon shine with effulgence in the firmament of the heart in consequence of yoga power. The result of yoga is Knowledge. Yoga is talked of very highly in the world. [^283] Whatever acts are destructive of Passion and Darkness constitute yoga in respect of its real character. Brahmacharya and abstention from injury are said to constitute yoga of the body; while restraining mind and speech properly are said to constitute yoga of the mind. The food that is obtained in alms from regenerate persons conversant with the ritual is distinguished from all other food. By taking that food abstemiously, one's sins born of Passion begin to fade. A yogin subsisting upon such food finds his senses gradually withdrawn from their objects. Hence, he should take only that measure of food which is strictly necessary for the support of his body. (Another advice that may be offered is that) that knowledge which one obtains gradually by mind devoted to yoga should cheerfully be made one's own during one's last moments by a forcible stretch of power. [^284] The embodied Soul, when divested of _Rajas_ (does not immediately attain to Emancipation but) assumes a subtile form with all the senses of perception and moves about in space. When his mind becomes unaffected by acts, he, in consequence of such renunciation (loses that subtile form and) becomes merged in _Prakriti_ (without however, yet attaining to Brahma or Emancipation which transcends _Prakriti_). [^285] After the destruction of this gross body, one who through absence of heedlessness escapes from all the three bodies (_viz_., the gross, the subtile and the _karana_) succeeds in attaining to Emancipation. [^286] The birth and death of creatures always depend upon the cause constituted by original Ignorance <span id="p110"><sup><small>[ p. 110 ]</small></sup></span> (or Avidya). When knowledge of Brahma arises, necessity no longer pursues the person. Those, however, that accept what is the reverse of truth (by believing that to be Self which is really not-Self) are men whose understandings are always taken up with the birth and death of all existent things. (Such people never dream even of Emancipation). [^287] Supporting their bodies by aid of patience, withdrawing their hearts from all external objects by the aid of their understanding, and withdrawing themselves from the world of senses, some yogins adore the senses in consequence of their subtility. [^288] Some amongst them, with mind cleansed by yoga, proceeding according to (the stages indicated in) the scriptures and reaching the highest, succeed in knowing it by the aid of the understanding and dwell in that which is the highest and which without resting on any other thing rests on itself. [^289] Some worship Brahma in images. Some worship Him as existing with attributes. Some repeatedly realise the highest Divinity which has been described to be like a flash of lightning and which is again indestructible. [^290] Others who have burnt their sins by penances, attain to Brahma in the end. All those high-souled persons attain to the highest end. With the eye of scripture one should observe the subtile attributes of these several forms, as distinguished by attributes, of Brahma that are (thus) worshipped by men. The yogin who has transcended the necessity of depending on the body, who has cast off all attachments, and whose mind is devoted to yoga abstraction, should be known as another instance of Infinity, as the Supreme Divinity, or as that which it Unmanifest. [^291] They whose hearts are devoted to the acquisition of knowledge succeed first in freeing themselves from the world of mortals. Subsequently, by casting off attachments they partake of the nature of Brahma and at last attain to the highest end.

<span id="p111"><sup><small>[ p. 111 ]</small></sup></span>

“Thus have persons conversant with the Vedas spoken of the religion that leads to the attainment of Brahma. They who follow that religion according to the measure of their knowledge all succeed in obtaining the highest end. Even those persons who succeed in acquiring knowledge that is incapable of being shaken (by the assaults of scepticism) and that makes its possessors free from attachments of every kind, attain to various high regions after death and become emancipated according to the measure of their knowledge. Those persons of pure hearts who have imbibed contentment from knowledge, and who have cast off all desires and attachments, gradually approach in respect of their nature, nearer and nearer to Brahma which has the unmanifest for his attribute, which is divine, and without birth and death. Realising that Brahma dwells in their Souls, they become themselves immutable and have never to return (to the earth). Attaining to that supreme state which is indestructible and eternal, they exist in felicity. The knowledge with respect to this world is even this: it exists (in the case of erring persons). It does not exist (in the case of those who have not been stupefied by error). The whole universe, bound up in desire, is revolving like a wheel. As the fibres of a lotus-stalk overspread themselves into every part of the stalk, after the same manner the fibres of desire, which have neither beginning nor end, spread themselves over every part of the body. As a weaver drives his threads into a cloth by means of his shuttle, after the same manner the threads that constitute the fabric of the universe are woven by the shuttle of Desire. He who properly knows transformations of _Prakriti_, _Prakriti_ herself and _Purusha_, becomes freed from Desire and attains to Emancipation. [^292] The divine _Rishi_ Narayana, that refuge of the universe, for the sake of compassion towards all creatures, clearly promulgated these means for the acquisition of immortality.’”

## SECTION CCXVIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘By following what conduct, O thou that art conversant with all courses of conduct, did Janaka, the ruler of Mithila versed in the religion of Emancipation, succeed in attaining to Emancipation, after casting off all worldly enjoyments?’

“Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the following old narrative of the particular conduct by which that ruler, thoroughly conversant with all courses of conduct, succeeded in achieving the highest felicity. There was a ruler in Mithila of the name of Janadeva of Janaka's race. He was ever engaged in reflecting upon the courses of conduct that might lead to the attainment of Brahma. A century of preceptors always used to live in his palace, lecturing him upon the diverse courses of duty followed by people who had betaken <span id="p112"><sup><small>[ p. 112 ]</small></sup></span> themselves to diverse modes of life. [^293] Given to the study of the Vedas, he was not very well satisfied with the speculations of his instructors on the character of the Soul, and in their doctrines of extinction upon the dissolution of the body or of rebirth after death. Once upon a time a great ascetic of the name of Panchasikha, the son of Kapila, having roamed over the whole world, arrived at Mithila. Endued with correct conclusions in respect of all speculations about the diverse duties connected with renunciation, he was above all pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, happiness and misery), and of doubts he had none. He was regarded as the foremost of _Rishis_. Dwelling wherever he pleased, he desired to place before the reach of all men eternal felicity that is so difficult of attainment. It seemed that he went about, amazing the world, having assumed the form of none else than that great _Rishi_, that lord of creatures, whom the followers of the Sankhya doctrine knew by the name of Kapila. He was the foremost of all the disciples of Asuri and was called the undying. He had performed a mental Sacrifice that had lasted for thousand years. [^294] He was firm in mind, and had completed all the rites and sacrifices that are enjoined in the scriptures and that lead to the attainment of Brahma. He was fully conversant with the five sheaths that cover the soul. [^295] He was devoted to the five acts connected with the adoration of Brahma, and had the five qualities (of tranquillity, self-restraint, etc.). Known (as already said) by the name of Panchasikha, he had approached one day a large concourse of _Rishis_ following the Sankhya doctrines and enquired of them about the highest object of human acquisition, _viz_., the Unmanifest or that upon which the five Purushas or sheaths (already named) rest. [^296] For the sake of obtaining a knowledge of the Soul, Asuri had enquired of his preceptor. In consequence of the latter's instructions and of his own penances, Asuri understood the distinction between the body and the Soul and had acquired celestial vision. [^297] In that concourse of ascetics, Asuri made his exposition of the Immutable One, and Indestructible Brahma which is seen in diverse forms. Panchasikha became a disciple of Asuri. He lived on human milk. There was a certain Brahmani of the name of Kapila. She was the wife of Asuri. [^298] Panchasikha was accepted by her as a son and he used to suck her breasts. In consequence of this, he came to be known as the son of Kapila and his understanding became fixed on Brahma. All this, about the circumstances of his birth and <span id="p113"><sup><small>[ p. 113 ]</small></sup></span> those that led to his becoming the son of Kapila, was said unto me by the divine _Rishi_. [^299] The latter also told me about the omniscience of Panchasikha. Conversant with all courses of duty, Panchasikha, after having himself acquired high knowledge, (came to Janaka) and knowing that that king had equal reverence for all his preceptors, began to amaze that century of preceptors (by an exposition of his doctrine fraught), with abundant reasons. Observing the talent of Kapileya, Janaka became exceedingly attached to him, and abandoning his hundred preceptors, began to follow him in particular. Then Kapileya began to discourse unto Janaka, who had according to the ordinance bent his head unto him (as a disciple should) and who was fully competent to apprehend the sage's instructions, upon that high religion of Emancipation which is explained in Sankhya treatises. Setting forth in the first place the sorrows of birth, he spoke next of the sorrows of (religious) acts. Having finished that topic he explained the sorrows of all states of life ending even with that in the high region of the Creator. [^300] He also discoursed upon that Delusion for whose sake is the practice of religion, and acts, and their fruits, and which is highly untrustworthy, destructible, unsteady, and uncertain. [^301] Sceptics say that when death (of the body) is seen and is a matter of direct evidence witnessed by all, they who maintain, in consequence of their faith in the scriptures, that something distinct from the body, called the Soul, exists are necessarily vanquished in argument. They also urge that one's death means the extinction of one's Soul, and that sorrow, decrepitude, and disease imply (partial) death of the Soul. He that maintains, owing to error, that the Soul is distinct from the body and exists after the loss of body, cherishes an opinion that is unreasonable. [^302] If that be regarded as existent which does not really exist in the world, then it may be mentioned that the king, being regarded so, is really never liable to decrepitude or death. But is he, on that account, to be really believed to be above decrepitude and death? [^303] When the question is whether an object exists or does not exist, and when that whose existence is asserted presents all the indications of non-existence, what is that upon which ordinary people rely in settling the affairs of life? Direct evidence is the root of both inference and the scriptures. The scriptures are capable of being contradicted by direct evidence. As to inference, its evidentiary effect is not much. Whatever be the topic, cease to reason on inference alone. There is nothing else called jiva than this body. In a banian seed is contained the capacity to produce leaves and flowers and fruits and roots and <span id="p114"><sup><small>[ p. 114 ]</small></sup></span> bark. From the grass and water that is taken by a cow are produced milk and butter, substances whose nature is different from that of the producing causes. Substances of different kinds when allowed to decompose in water for some time produce spirituous liquors whose nature is quite different from that of those substances that produce them. After the same manner, from the vital seed is produced the body and its attributes, with the understanding, consciousness, mind, and other possessions. Two pieces of wood, rubbed together, produce fire. The stone called _Suryakanta_, coming in contact with the rays of the Sun, produces fire. Any solid metallic substance, heated in fire, dries up water when coming in contact with it. Similarly, the material body produces the mind and its attributes of perception, memory, imagination, etc. As the loadstone moves iron, similarly, the senses are controlled by the mind. [^304] Thus reason the sceptics. The sceptics, however, are in error. For the disappearance (of only the animating force) upon the body becoming lifeless (and not the simultaneous extinction of the body upon the occurrence of that event) is the proof (of the truth that the body is not the Soul but that the Soul is something separate from the body and outlives it certainly. If, indeed, body and Soul had been the same thing, both would have disappeared at the same instant of time. Instead of this, the dead body may be seen for some time _after_ the occurrence of death. Death, therefore, means the flight from the body of something that is different from the body). The supplication of the deities by the very men who deny the separate existence of the Soul is another good argument for the proposition that the Soul is separate from the body or has existence that may be independent of a gross material case. The deities to whom these men pray are incapable of being seen or touched. They are believed to exist in subtile forms. (Really, if a belief in deities divested of gross material forms does no violence to their reason, why should the existence of an immaterial Soul alone do their reason such violence)? Another argument against the sceptic is that his proposition implies a destruction of acts (for if body and Soul die together, the acts also of this life would perish,—a conclusion which no man can possibly come to if he is to explain the inequalities or condition witnessed in the universe). [^305] These that have been mentioned, and that have material forms, cannot possibly be the causes (of the immaterial Soul and its immaterial accompaniments of perception, memory, and the like). The identity of immaterial existences with objects that are material cannot be comprehended. (Hence objects that are themselves material cannot by any means be causes for the production of things <span id="p115"><sup><small>[ p. 115 ]</small></sup></span> immaterial).—Some are of opinion that there is rebirth and that it is caused by Ignorance, the desire for acts, cupidity, heedlessness, and adherence to other faults. They say that Ignorance (Avidya) is the soul. Acts constitute the seed that is placed in that soil. Desire is the water that causes that seed to grow, in this way they explain rebirth. They maintain that that ignorance being ingrained in an imperceptible way, one mortal body being destroyed, another starts I up immediately from it; and that when it is burnt by the aid of knowledge, the destruction of existence itself follows or the person attains to what is called _Nirvana_. This opinion also is erroneous. \[This is the doctrine of Buddhists\]. It may be asked that when the being that is thus reborn is a different one in respect of its nature, birth, and purposes connected with virtue and vice why should I then be regarded to have any identity with the being that was? Indeed, the only inference that can be drawn is that the entire chain of existences of a particular being is not really a chain of connected links (but that existences in succession are unconnected with one another). [^306] Then, again if the being that is the result of a rebirth be really different from what it was in a previous phase of existence, it may be asked what satisfaction can arise to a person from the exercise of the virtue of charity, or from the acquisition of knowledge or of ascetic power, since the acts performed by one are to concentrate upon another person in another phase of existence (without the performer himself being existent to enjoy them?) Another result of the doctrine under refutation would be that one in this life may be rendered miserable by the acts of another in a previous life, or having become miserable may again be rendered happy. By seeing, however, what actually takes place in the world, a proper conclusion may be drawn with respect to the unseen. [^307] The separate Consciousness that is the result of rebirth is (according to what may be inferred from the Buddhistic theory of life) different from the Consciousness that had preceded it in a previous life. The manner, however, in which the rise or appearance of that separate Consciousness is explained by that theory does not seem to be consistent or reasonable. The Consciousness (as it existed in the previous life) was the very reverse of eternal, being only <span id="p116"><sup><small>[ p. 116 ]</small></sup></span> transitory, extending as it did till dissolution of the body. That which had an end cannot be taken as the cause for the production of a second Consciousness appearing after the occurrence of the end. If, again, the very loss of the previous Consciousness be regarded as the cause of the production of the second Consciousness, then upon the death of a human body being brought about by a heavy bludgeon, a second body would arise from the body that is thus deprived of animation. [^308] Once more, their doctrine of extinction of life (or _Nirvana_ or _Sattwasankshaya_) is exposed to the objection that that extinction will become a recurring phenomenon like that of the seasons, or the year, or the _yuga_, or heat, or cold, or objects that are agreeable or disagreeable. [^309] If for the purpose of avoiding these objections, the followers of this doctrine assert the existence of a Soul that is permanent and unto which each new Consciousness attaches, they expose themselves to the new objection that that permanent substance, by being overcome with decrepitude, and with death that brings about destruction, may in time be itself weakened and destroyed. If the supports of a mansion are weakened by time, the mansion itself is sure to fall down at last. [^310] The senses, the mind, wind, blood, flesh, bones (and all the constituents of the body), one after another, meet with destruction and enter each into its own productive cause. [^311] If again the existence of an eternal Soul be asserted that is immutable, that is the refuge of the understanding, consciousness, and other attributes of the usual kind, and that is dissociated from all these, such an assertion would be exposed to a serious objection, <span id="p117"><sup><small>[ p. 117 ]</small></sup></span> for then all that is usually done in the world would be unmeaning, especially with reference to the attainment of the fruits of the charity and other religious acts. All the declarations in the _Srutis_ inciting to those acts, and all acts connected with the conduct of men in the world, would be equally unmeaning, for the Soul being dissociated from the understanding and the mind, there is no one to enjoy the fruits of good acts and Vedic rites. [^312] Thus diverse kinds of speculations arise in the mind. Whether this opinion is right or that is right, there is no means of settling. Engaged in reflecting on those opinions, particular persons follow particular lines of speculation. The understandings of these, directed to particular theories, become wholly taken up with them and are at last entirely lost in them. Thus all men are rendered miserable by pursuits, good or bad. The Vedas along, bringing them back to the right path, guide them along it, like grooms conducting their elephants. [^313] Many men, with weakened minds, covet objects that are fraught with great happiness. These, however, have soon to meet with a much larger measure of sorrow, and then, forcibly torn from their coveted meat, they have to own the sway of death. What use has one, who is destined to destruction and whose life is unstable, with kinsmen and friends and wives and other possessions of this kind? He who encounters death after having cast off all these, passes easily out of the world and has never to return. Earth, space, water, heat and wind, always support and nourish the body. Reflecting upon this, how can one feel any affection for one's body? Indeed, the body, which is subject to destruction, has no joy in it. Having heard these words of Panchasikha that were free from deception, unconnected with delusion (because discouraging sacrifices and other Vedic acts), highly salutary, and treating of the Soul, king Janadeva became filled with wonder, and prepared himself to address the _Rishi_ once more.'"

## SECTION CCXIX

“Bhishma said, ‘Janadeva of the race of Janaka, thus instructed by the great _Rishi_ Panchasikha, once more asked him about the topic of existence or nonexistence after death.’

“Janadeva said, ‘O illustrious one, if no person retains any knowledge after departing from this state of being, if, indeed, this is true, where then is the difference between Ignorance and Knowledge? What do we gain then by knowledge and what do we lose by ignorance? Behold, O foremost of regenerate persons, that if Emancipation be: such, then all religious acts and vows end only in annihilation. Of what avail would then the distinction be between heedfulness and heedlessness? If Emancipation means dissociation <span id="p118"><sup><small>[ p. 118 ]</small></sup></span> from all objects of pleasurable enjoyment or an association with objects that are not lasting, for what then would men cherish a desire for action, or, having set themselves to action, continue to devise the necessary means for the accomplishment of desired ends? What then is the truth (in connection with this topic)?’

“Bhishma continued, 'Beholding the king enveloped in thick darkness, stupefied by error, and become helpless, the learned Panchasikha tranquillised him by once more addressing him in the following words, 'In this (Emancipation) the consummation is not Extinction. Nor is that consummation any kind of Existence (that one can readily conceive). This that we see is a union of body, senses, and mind. Existing independently as also controlling one another, these go on acting. The materials that constitute the body are water, space, wind, heat, and earth. These exist together (forming the body) according to their own nature. They disunite again according to their own nature. Space and wind and heat and water and earth,—these five objects in a state of union constitute the body. The body is not one element. Intelligence, stomachic heat, and the vital breaths, called _Prana_, etc., that are all wind,—these three are said to be organs of action. The senses, the objects of the senses (_viz_., sound, form, etc.), the power (dwelling in those objects) in consequence of which they become capable of being perceived, the faculties (dwelling in the senses) in consequence of which they succeed in perceiving them, the mind, the vital breaths called _Prana_, _Apana_ and the rest, and the various juices and humours that are the results of the digestive organs, flow from the three organs already named. [^314] Hearing, touch, taste, vision, and scent,—these are the five senses. They have derived their attributes from the mind which, indeed, is their cause. The mind, existing as an attribute of _Chit_ has three states, _viz_., pleasure, pain, and absence of both pleasure and pain. Sound, touch, form, taste, scent, and the objects to which they inhere,—these till the moment of one's death are causes for the production of one's knowledge. Upon the senses rest all acts (that lead to heaven), as also renunciation (leading to the attainment of _Brahma_), and also the ascertainment of truth in respect of all topics of enquiry. The learned say that ascertainment (of truth) is the highest object of existence, and that it is the seed or root of Emancipation; and with respect to Intelligence, they say that leads to Emancipation and _Brahma_. [^315] That person who regards this union of perishable attributes (called the body and the objects of the senses) as the Soul, feels, in consequence of such imperfection of knowledge, much misery that proves again to be unending. Those persons, on the other hand, who regard all worldly objects as not-Soul, and who on that account cease to have any affection or attachment for them, have never to suffer any sorrow for sorrow, in their case stands in need of some foundation upon which to rest. In this connection there <span id="p119"><sup><small>[ p. 119 ]</small></sup></span> exists the unrivalled branch of knowledge which treats of Renunciation. It is called _Samyagradha_. I shall discourse to thee upon it. Listen to it for the sake of thy Emancipation. Renunciation of acts is (laid down) for all persons who strive earnestly for Emancipation. They, however, who have not been taught correctly (and who on that account think that tranquillity may be attained without renunciation) have to bear a heavy burthen of sorrow. Vedic sacrifices and other rites exist for renunciation of wealth and other possessions. For renunciation of all enjoyments exist vows and fasts of diverse kinds. For renunciation of pleasure and happiness, exist penances and _yoga_. Renunciation, however, of everything, is the highest kind of renunciation. This that I shall presently tell thee is the one path pointed out by the learned for that renunciation of everything. They that betake themselves to that path succeed in driving off all sorrow. They, however, that deviate from it reap distress and misery. [^316] First speaking of the five organs of knowledge having the mind for the sixth, and all of which dwell in the understanding, I shall tell thee of the five organs of action having strength for their sixth. The two hands constitute two organs ok action. The two legs are the two organs for moving from one place to another. The sexual organ exists for both pleasure and the continuation of the species. The lower duct, leading from the stomach downwards, is the organ for expulsion of all used-up matter. The organs of utterance exist for the expression of sounds. Know that these five organs of action appertain or belong to the mind. These are the eleven organs of knowledge and of action (counting the mind). One should quickly cast off the mind with the understanding. [^317] In the act of hearing, three causes must exist together, _viz_., two ears, sound, and the mind. The same is the case with the perception of touch; the same with that of form; the same with that of taste and smell. [^318] These fifteen accidents or attributes are needed for the several kinds of perception indicated. Every man, in consequence of them, becomes conscious of three separate things in respect of those perceptions (_viz_., a material organ, its particular function, and the mind upon which that function acts). There are again (in respect of all perceptions of the mind) three classes, _viz_., those that appertain to Goodness, those that appertain to Passion, and those that appertain to Darkness. Into them run, three kinds of consciousness, including all feelings and emotions. Raptures, satisfaction, joy, happiness, and tranquillity, arising in the mind from any Perceptible cause or in the absence of any apparent cause, belong to the attribute of Goodness. Discontent, regret, grief, cupidity, and vindictiveness, causeless or occasioned by any perceptible cause, are the indications of the attribute known as Passion. Wrong judgment, stupefaction, heedlessness, dreams, and sleepiness, however caused, belong to the attribute of Darkness. Whatever state of consciousness exists, with respect to either the body or the mind, united with joy or satisfaction, should be regarded as due to the quality <span id="p120"><sup><small>[ p. 120 ]</small></sup></span> of Goodness. Whatever state of consciousness exists united with any feeling of discontent or cheerlessness should be regarded as occasioned by an accession of the attribute of Passion into the mind. Whatever state, as regards either the body or the mind, exists with error or heedlessness, should be known as indicative of Darkness which is incomprehensible and inexplicable. The organ of hearing rests on space; it is space itself (under limitations); (Sound has that organ for its refuge). (Sound, therefore, is a modification of space). In perceiving sound, one may not immediately acquire a knowledge of the organ of hearing and of space. But when sound is perceived, the organ of hearing and space do not long remain unknown. (By destroying the ear, sound and space, may be destroyed; and, lastly, by destroying the mind all may be destroyed). The same is the case with the skin, the eyes, the tongue, and the nose constituting the fifth. They exist in touch, form, taste, and smell. They constitute the faculty of perception and they are the mind. [^319] Each employed in its own particular function, all the five organs of action and five others of knowledge exist together, and upon the union, of the ten dwells the mind as the eleventh and upon the mind the understanding as the twelfth. If it be said that these twelve do not exist together, then the consequence that would result would be death in dreamless slumber. But as there is no death in dreamless slumber, it must be conceded that these twelve exist together as regards themselves but separately from the Soul. The co-existence of those twelve with the Soul that is referred to in common speech is only a common form of speech with the vulgar for ordinary purposes of the world. The dreamer, in consequence of the appearance of past sensual impressions, becomes conscious of his senses in their subtile forms, and endued as he already is with the three attributes (of goodness, passion, and darkness), he regards his senses as existing with their respective objects and, therefore, acts and moves about with an imaginary body after the manner of his own self while awake. [^320] That dissociation of the Soul from the understanding and i the mind with the senses, which quickly disappears, which has no stability, and which the mind causes to arise only when influenced by darkness, is felicity that partakes, as the learned say, of the nature of darkness and is experienced in this gross body only. (The felicity of Emancipation certainly differs from it). [^321] Over the felicity of Emancipation also, the felicity, _viz_., which is awakened by the inspired teaching of the Vedas and in which no one <span id="p121"><sup><small>[ p. 121 ]</small></sup></span> sees the slightest tincture of sorrow,—the same indescribable and truth concealing darkness seems to spread itself (but in reality the felicity of Emancipation is unstained by darkness). [^322] Like again to what occurs in dreamless slumber, in Emancipation also, subjective and objective existences (from Consciousness to objects of the senses, all included), which have their origin in one's acts, are all discarded. In some, that are overwhelmed by _Avidya_, these exist, firmly grafted with them. Unto others who have transcended Avidya and have won knowledge, they never come at any time. [^323] They that are conversant with speculations about the character of Soul and not-Soul, say that this sum total (of the senses, etc.) is body (_kshetra_). That existent thing which rests upon the mind is called Soul (_kshetrajna_). When such is the case, and when all creatures, in consequence of the well-known cause (which consists of ignorance, desire, and acts whose beginning cannot be conceived), exist, due also to their primary nature (which is a state of union between Soul and body), (of these two) which then is destructible, and how can that (_viz_., the Soul), which is said to be eternal, suffer destruction? [^324] As small rivers falling into larger ones lose their forms and names, and the larger ones (thus enlarged) rolling into the ocean, lose their forms and names too, after the same manner occurs that form of extinction of life called Emancipation. [^325] This being the case, when _jiva_ which is characterised by attributes, is received into the Universal Soul, and when all its attributes disappear, how can it be the object of mention by differentiation? One who is conversant with that understanding which is directed towards the accomplishment of Emancipation and who heedfully seeks to know the Soul, is never soiled by the evil fruits of <span id="p122"><sup><small>[ p. 122 ]</small></sup></span> his acts even as a lotus leaf though dipped in water is never soaked by it. When one becomes freed from the very strong bonds, many in number, occasioned by affection for children and spouses and love for sacrifices and other rites, when one casts off both joy and sorrow and transcends all attachments, one then attains to the highest end and entering into the Universal Soul becomes incapable of differentiation. When one has understood the declarations of the _Srutis_ that lead to correct inferences (about Brahma) and has practised those auspicious virtues which the same and other scriptures inculcate, one may lie down at ease, setting at nought the fears of decrepitude and death. When both merits and sins disappear, and the fruits, in the form of joy and sorrow, arising therefrom, are destroyed, men, unattached to everything, take refuge at first on Brahma invested with personality, and then behold impersonal _Brahma_ in their understandings. [^326] _Jiva_ in course of its downward descent under the influence of Avidya lives here (within its cell formed by acts) after the manner of a silk-worm residing within its cell made of threads woven by itself. Like the freed silk-worm again that abandons its cell, _jiva_ also abandons its house generated by its acts. The final result that takes place is that its sorrows are then destroyed like a clump of earth falling with violence upon a rocky mass. [^327] As the _Ruru_ casting off its old horns or the snake casting off its slough goes on without attracting any notice, after the same manner a person that is unattached casts off all his sorrows. As a bird deserts a tree that is about to fall down upon a piece of water and thus severing itself from it alights on a (new) resting place, after the same manner the person freed from attachments casts off both joy and sorrow and dissociated even from his subtile and subtiler forms attains to that end which is fraught with the highest prosperity. [^328] Their own ancestor Janaka, the chief of Mithila, beholding his city burning in a conflagration, himself proclaimed, ‘_In this conflagration nothing of mine is burning_.’ King Janadeva, having listened to these words capable of yielding immortality and uttered by Panchasikha, and arriving at the truth after carefully reflecting upon everything that the latter had said, cast off his sorrows and lived on in the enjoyment of great felicity. He who reads this discourse, O king, that treat of emancipation and who always reflects upon it, is never pained by any calamity, and freed from sorrow, attains to emancipation like Janadeva, the ruler of Mithila after his meeting with Panchasikha.'"

“Yudhishthira said, ‘By doing what does one acquire happiness, and what is that by doing which one meets with woe? What also is that, O Bharata, by doing which one becomes freed from fear and sojourns here crowned with success (in respect of the objects of life)?’

“Bhishma said, ‘The ancients who had their understandings directed to the _Srutis_, highly applauded the duty of self-restraint for all the orders generally but for the. Brahmanas in especial. Success in respect of religious rites never occurs in the case of one that is not self-restrained. Religious rites, penances, truth,—all these are established upon self-restraint. Self-restraint enhances one's energy. Self-restraint is said to be sacred. The man of self-restraint becomes sinless and fearless and wins great results. One that is self-restrained sleeps happily and wakes happily. He sojourns happily in the world and his mind always remains cheerful. Every kind of excitement is quietly controlled by self-restraint. One that is not self-restrained fails in a similar endeavour. The man of self-restraint beholds his innumerable foes (in the form of lust, desire, and wrath, etc.), as if these dwell in a separate body. Like tigers and other carnivorous beasts, persons destitute of self-restraint always inspire all creatures with dread. For controlling these men, the Self-born (Brahman) created kings. In all the (four) modes of life, the practice or self-restraint is distinguished above all other virtues. The fruits of self-restraint are much greater than those obtainable in all the modes of life. I shall now mention to thee the indications of those persons who prize self-restraint highly. [^329] They are nobility, calmness of disposition, contentment, faith, forgiveness, invariable simplicity, the absence of garrulity, humility, reverence for superiors, benevolence, compassion for all creatures, frankness, abstention from talk upon kings and men in authority, from all false and useless discourses, and from applause and censure of others. The self-restrained man becomes desirous of emancipation and, quietly bearing present joys and griefs, is never exhilarated or depressed by prospective ones. Destitute of vindictiveness and all kinds of guile, and unmoved by praise and blame, such a man is well-behaved, has good manners, is pure of soul, has firmness or fortitude, and is a complete master of his passions. Receiving honours in this world, such a man in afterlife goes to heaven. Causing all creatures to acquire what they cannot acquire without his aid, such a man rejoices and becomes happy. [^330] Devoted to universal benevolence, such a man never cherishes animosity for any one. Tranquil like the ocean at a dead calm, wisdom fills his soul and he is never cheerful. Possessed of intelligence, and deserving of universal reverence, the man of self-restraint never cherishes fear of any creature and is feared by no creature in return. That man who never rejoices even at large acquisitions and never feels sorrow when overtaken by calamity, is said to be possessed of contented wisdom. Such a man is said to be self-restrained. Indeed, such a <span id="p124"><sup><small>[ p. 124 ]</small></sup></span> man is said to be a regenerate being. Versed with the scriptures and endued with a pure soul, the man of self-restraint, accomplishing all those acts that are done by the good, enjoys their high fruits. They, however, that are of wicked soul never betake themselves to the path represented by benevolence, forgiveness, tranquillity, contentment, sweetness of speech, truth, liberality and comfort. Their path consists of lust and wrath and cupidity and envy of others and boastfulness. Subjugating lust and wrath, practising the vow of Brahmacharya and becoming a complete master of his senses, the Brahmana, exerting himself with endurance in the austerest of penances, and observing the most rigid restraints, should live in this world, calmly waiting for his time like one seeming to have a body though fully knowing that he is not subject to destruction.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘The three regenerate classes, who are given to sacrifices and other rites, sometimes eat the remnants, consisting of meat and wine, of sacrifices in honour of the deities, from motives of obtaining children and heaven. What, O grandsire, is the character of this act?’

“Bhishma said, ‘Those who eat forbidden food without being observant of the sacrifices and vows ordained in the Vedas are regarded as wilful men. (They are regarded as fallen even here). Those, on the other hand, who eat such food in the observance of Vedic sacrifices and vows and induced by the desire of fruits in the shape of heaven and children, ascend to heaven but fall down on the exhaustion of their merits.’ [^331]

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Common people say that fasting is _tapas_ (penances). Is fasting, however, really so, or is penance something different?’

“Bhishma said, ‘People do regard fast, measured by months or fortnights or days, as penance. In the opinion, however of the good, such is not penance. On the other hand, fast is an impediment to the acquisition of the knowledge of the Soul. [^332] The renunciation of acts (that is so difficult for all) and humility (consisting in the worship of all creatures and consideration for them all) constitute the highest penance. That is distinguished above all kinds of penance. He who betakes himself to such penance is regarded as one that is always fasting and that is always leading a life of _Brahmacharya_. Such a Brahmana will become a _Muni_ always, a deity evermore, and sleepless forever, <span id="p125"><sup><small>[ p. 125 ]</small></sup></span> and one engaged in the pursuit of virtue only, even if he lives in the bosom of a family. He will become a vegetarian always, and pure for ever. He will become an eater always of ambrosia, and an adorer always of gods and guests. Indeed, he will be regarded as one always subsisting on sacrificial remnants, as one ever devoted to the duty of hospitality, as one always full of faith, and as one ever worshipping gods and guests.’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘How can one practising such penance come to be regarded as one that is always fasting or as one that is ever devoted to the vow of Brahmacharya, or as one that is always subsisting upon sacrificial remnants or as one that is ever regardful of guests?’

“Bhishma said, ‘He will be regarded as one that is always fasting if he eats once during the day and once during the night at the fixed hours without eating anything during the interval. Such a Brahmana, by always speaking the truth and by adhering always to wisdom, and by going to his wife only in her season and never at other times, becomes a _Brahmacharin_ (celibate). By never eating meat of animals not killed for sacrifice, he will become a strict vegetarian. By always becoming charitable he will become ever pure, and by abstaining from sleep during the day he will become one that is always wakeful. Know, O Yudhishthira, that that man who eats only after having fed his servants and guests becomes an eater always of ambrosia. That Brahmana who never eats till gods and guests are fed, wins, by such abstention, heaven itself. He is said to subsist upon sacrificial remnants, who eats only what remains after feeding the gods, the _Pitris_, servants, and guests. Such men win numberless regions of felicity in next life. To their homes come, with Brahman himself, the gods and the _Apsaras_. They who share their food with the deities and the _Pitris_ pass their days in constant happiness with their sons and grandsons and at last, leaving off this body, attain to a very high end.’”


## SECTION CCXXII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘In this world, O Bharata, acts good and bad attach themselves to man for the purpose of producing fruits for enjoyment or endurance. Is man, however, to be regarded as their doer or is he not to be regarded so? Doubt fills my mind with respect to this question. I desire to hear this in detail from thee, O grandsire!’

“Bhishma said, 

“Prahlada said, ‘He who is unacquainted with the origin and the destruction of all created objects, is, in consequence of such ignorance, stupefied. He, however, who is conversant with these two things, is never stupefied. All kinds of entities and non-entities come into being or cease in consequence of their own nature. No kind of personal exertion is needed (for the production of such phenomena). [^333] In the absence, therefore, of personal exertion, it is evident that no personal agent exists for the production of all this that we perceive. But though (in reality) the person (or the _chit_) never does anything, yet (through the influence of Ignorance) a consciousness in respect of angry overspreads itself on it. He who regards himself as the doer of acts good or bad, possesses a wisdom that is vitiated. Such a person is, according to my judgment, unacquainted with the truth. [^334] If, O Sakra, the being called person were really the actor, then all acts undertaken for his own benefit would certainly be crowned with success. None of those acts would be defeated. Among even persons struggling their utmost the suspension of what is not desired and the occurrence of what is desired are not to be seen. What becomes then of personal exertion? In the case of some, we see that without <span id="p127"><sup><small>[ p. 127 ]</small></sup></span> any exertion on their part, what is not desired is suspended and what is desired is accomplished. This then must be the result of Nature. Some persons again are seen to present extraordinary aspects, for though possessed of superior intelligence they have to solicit wealth from others that are vulgar in features and endued with little intelligence. Indeed, when all qualities, good or bad, enter a person, urged by Nature, what ground is there for one to boast (of one's superior possessions)? All these flow from Nature. This is my settled conclusion. Even Emancipation and knowledge of self, according to me, flow from the same source.

“In this world all fruits, good or bad, that attach themselves to persons, are regarded as the result of acts. I shall now discourse to thee in full on the subject of acts. Listen to me. As a crow, while eating some food, proclaims the presence of that food (to the members of its species) by its repeated cawing, after the same manner all our acts only proclaim the indications of Nature. He who is acquainted with only the transformations of Nature but not with Nature that is supreme and exists by herself, feels stupefaction in consequence of his ignorance. He, however, who understands the difference between Nature and her transformations is never stupefied. All existent things have their origin in Nature. In consequence of one's certainty of conviction in this respect, one would never be affected by pride or arrogance. When I know what the origin is of all the ordinances of morality and when I am acquainted with the unstability of all objects, I am incapable, O Sakra, of indulging in grief. All this is endued with an end. Without attachments, without pride, without desire and hope, freed from all bonds, and dissociated from everything, I am passing my time in great happiness, engaged in beholding the appearance and disappearance of all created objects. For one that is possessed of wisdom, that is self-restrained, that is contented, that is without desire and hope, and that beholds all things with the light of self-knowledge, no trouble or anxiety exists, O Sakra! I have no affection or aversion for either Nature or her transformations. I do not behold any one now who is my foe nor any one who is mine own. I do not O, Sakra, at any time covet either heaven, or this world, or the nether regions. It is not the case that there is no happiness in understanding the Soul. But the Soul, being dissociated from everything, cannot enjoy felicity. Hence I desire nothing.’

“Sakra said, ‘Tell me the means, O Prahlada, by which this kind of wisdom may be attained and by which this kind of tranquillity may be made one's own. I solicit thee.’

“Prahlada said, ‘By simplicity, by heedfulness, by cleansing the Soul, by mastering the passions, and by waiting upon aged seniors, O Sakra, a person succeeds in attaining to Emancipation. Know this, however, that one acquires wisdom from Nature, and that the acquisition of tranquillity also is due to the same cause. Indeed, everything else that thou perceivest is due to Nature.

“Thus addressed by the lord of the _Daityas_, Sakra became filled with wonder, and commended those words, O king, with a cheerful heart. The lord of the three worlds then, having worshipped the lord of the _Daityas_, took his leave and proceeded to his own abode.’”

## SECTION CCXXIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, by adopting what sort of intelligence may a monarch, who has been divested of prosperity and crushed by Time's heavy bludgeon, still live on this earth.’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old narrative of the discourse between Vasava and Virochana's son, Vali. One day Vasava, after having subjugated all the _Asuras_, repaired to the Grandsire and joining his hands bowed to him and enquired after the whereabouts of Vali. Tell me, O Brahman, where I may now find that Vali whose wealth continued undiminished even though he used to give it away as lavishly as he wished. He was the god of wind. He was Varuna. He was Surya. He was Soma. He was Agni that used to warm all creatures. He became water (for the use of all). I do not find where he now is. Indeed, O Brahman, tell me where I may find Vali now. Formerly, it was he who used to illumine all the points of the compass (as Surya) and to set (when evening came). Casting off idleness, it was he who used to pour rain upon all creatures at the proper season. I do not now see that Vali. Indeed, tell me, O Brahmana, where I may find that chief of the _Asuras_ now.’

“Brahman said, ‘It is not becoming in thee, O Maghavat, to thus enquire after Vali now. One should not, however, speak an untruth when one is questioned by another. For this reason, I shall tell thee the whereabouts of Vali. O lord of Sachi, Vali may now have taken his birth among camels or bulls or asses or horses, and having become the foremost of his species may now be staying in an empty apartment.’

“Sakra said, ‘If, O Brahman, I happen to meet with Vali in an empty apartment, shall I slay him or spare him? Tell me how I shall act.’

“Brahman said, ‘Do not, O Sakra, injure Vali, Vali does not deserve death. Thou shouldst, on the other hand, O Vasava, solicit instruction from him about morality, O Sakra, as thou pleasest.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus addressed by the divine Creator, Indra roamed over the earth, seated on the back of Airavata and attended by circumstances of great splendour. He succeeded in meeting with Vali, who, as the Creator had said, was living in an empty apartment clothed in the form of an ass.’

“Sakra said, ‘Thou art now, O Danava, born as an ass subsisting on chaff as thy food. This thy order of birth is certainly a low one. Dost thou or dost thou not grieve for it? I see what I had never seen before, _viz_., thyself brought under the sway of thy enemies, divested of prosperity and friends, and shorn of energy and prowess. Formerly, thou used to make progress through the worlds with thy train consisting of thousands of vehicles and thousands of kinsmen, and to move along, scorching everybody with thy splendour and counting us as nought. The _Daityas_, looking up to thee as their protector, lived under thy sway. Through thy power, the earth used to yield crops without waiting for tillage. Today, however, I behold thee overtaken by this dire calamity. Dost thou or dost thou not indulge in grief for this? When formerly <span id="p129"><sup><small>[ p. 129 ]</small></sup></span> thou usedst, with pride reflected in thy face, to divide on the eastern shores of the ocean thy vast wealth among thy kinsmen, what was the state of thy mind then? Formerly, for many years, when blazing with splendour, thou usedst to sport, thousands of celestial damsels used to dance before thee. All of them were adorned with garlands of lotuses and all had companions bright as gold. What, O lord of _Danavas_, was the state of thy mind then and what is it now? Thou hadst a very large umbrella made of gold and adorned with jewels and gems. Full two and forty thousand Gandharvas used in those days to dance before thee. [^335] In thy sacrifices thou hadst a stake that was very large and made entirely of gold. On such occasions thou wert to give away millions upon millions of kine. What, O Daitya, was the state of thy mind then? Formerly, engaged in sacrifice, thou hadst gone round the whole earth, following the rule of the hurling of the _Samya_: What was the state of thy mind then? [^336] I do not now behold that golden jar of thine, nor that umbrella of thine, nor those fans. I behold not also, O king of the _Asuras_, that garland of thine which was given to thee by the Grandsire.’

“Vali said, ‘Thou seest not now, O Vasava, my jar and umbrella and fans. Thou seest not also my garland, that gift of the Grandsire. Those precious possessions of mine about which thou askest are now buried in the darkness of a cave. When my time comes again, thou wilt surely behold them again. This conduct of thine, however, does not become thy fame or birth. Thyself in prosperity, thou desirest to mock me that am sunk in adversity. They that have acquired wisdom, and have won contentment therefrom, they that are of tranquil souls, that are virtuous and good among creatures, never grieve in misery nor rejoice in happiness. Led, however, by a vulgar intelligence, thou indulgest in brag, O Purandara! When thou shalt become like me thou shalt not then indulge in speeches like these.’”


## SECTION CCXXIV

“Bhishma said, ‘Once more, laughing at Vali who was sighing like a snake, Sakra addressed him for saying something more pointed than what had said before. [^337]

<span id="p130"><sup><small>[ p. 130 ]</small></sup></span>

“Sakra said, ‘Formerly, attended by a train consisting of thousands of vehicles and kinsmen, thou usedst to make thy progresses, scorching all the worlds with thy splendour and regarding us as nought. Thou art now, however, deserted by both kinsmen and friends. Beholding this miserable plight that has overtaken thee, dost thou or dost thou not indulge in grief? Formerly, all the worlds were under thy sway and great was thy joy. I ask, dost thou or dost thou not indulge in grief now, for this fall of thine in respect of external splendour?’

“Vali said, ‘Considering all this to be transitory,—due, indeed, to the course of time,—I do not, O Sakra, indulge in grief. These things have an end. These bodies that creatures have, O chief of celestials, are all transitory. For that reason, O Sakra, I do not grieve (for this asinine form of mine). Nor is this form due to any fault of mine. The animating principle and the body come into existence together, in consequence of their own nature. They grow together, and meet with destruction together. Having obtained this form of existence I have not been permanently enslaved by it. Since I know this, I have no cause for sorrow in consequence of that knowledge. As the final resting-place of all rivers is the ocean, even so the end of all embodied creatures is death. Those persons that know this well are never stupefied, O wielder of the thunderbolt! They, however, who are overwhelmed with Passion and loss of judgment, do not know this, they whose understanding is lost, sink under the weight of misfortune. A person who acquires a keen understanding succeeds in destroying all his sins. A sinless person acquires the attribute of Goodness, and having acquired it becomes cheerful. They, however, that deviate from the attribute of Goodness, and obtain repeated rebirths, are obliged to indulge in sorrow and grief, led on by desire and the objects of the senses. Success or the reverse, in respect of the attainment of all objects of desire, life or death, the fruits of action that are represented by pleasure or pain, I neither dislike nor like. When one slays another, one slays only that other's body. That man, who thinks that it is he who slays another, is himself slain. Indeed, both of them are ignorant of the truth, _viz_., he who slays and he who is slain. [^338] That person, O Maghavat, who having killed or vanquished any one brags of his manliness, should know that he is not the actor but the act (of which he boasts) has been accomplished by a real agent (who is different). When the question comes as to who is it that causes the creation and the destruction of things in the world, it is generally regarded that some person (who has himself been caused or created) has caused the act (of creation or destruction). Know, however, that the person who is so regarded <span id="p131"><sup><small>[ p. 131 ]</small></sup></span> has (as already said) a creator. Earth, light or heat, space, water, and wind constituting the fifth—from these do all creatures spring. (When this is known to me) what sorrow can I feel (for this change in my condition)? one that is possessed of great learning, one that has not much of learning, one that is possessed of strength, one that is destitute of strength, one that is possessed of personal beauty, and one that is very ugly, one that is fortunate and one that is not blessed by fortune, are all swept away by Time, which is too deep to be fathomed, by its own energy. When I know that I have been vanquished by Time, what sorrow can I feel (for this alteration in my circumstances)? One that burns anything burns a thing that has been already burnt. One that slays, only slays a victim already slain. One that is destroyed has been before destroyed. A thing that is acquired by a person is that which is already arrived and intended for his acquisition. This Time is like an ocean. There is no island in it. Where, indeed, is its other shore? Its boundary cannot be seen. Reflecting even deeply, I do not behold the end of this continuous stream that is the great ordainer of all things and that is certainly celestial. If I did not understand that it is Time that destroys all creatures, then, perhaps, I would have felt the emotions of joy and pride and wrath, O lord of Sachi! Hast thou come here to condemn me, having ascertained that I am now bearing the form of an ass that subsists upon chaff and that is now passing his days in a lonely spot remote from the habitations of men? If I wish, even now I can assume various awful forms beholding any one of which thou wouldst beat a hasty retreat from my presence. It is Time that gives everything and again takes away everything. It is Time that ordains all things. Do not, O Sakra, brag of thy manliness. Formerly, O Purandara, on occasions of my wrath everything used to become agitated. I am acquainted, however, O Sakra, with the eternal attributes of all things in the world. Do thou also know the truth. Do not suffer thyself to be filled with wonder. Affluence and its origin are not under one's control. Thy mind seems to be like that of a child. It is the same as it was before. Open thy eyes, O Maghavat, and adopt an understanding established on certitude and truth. The gods, men, the _Pitris_, the _Gandharvas_, the snakes, and the _Rakshasas_, were all under my sway in days gone by. Thou knowest this, O Vasava! Their understandings stupefied by ignorance, all creatures used to flatter me, saying, ‘Salutations to that point of the compass whither Virochana's son Vali may now be staying!' O lord of Sachi, I do not at all grieve when I think of that honour (which is no longer paid to me). I feel no sorrow for this fall of mine. My understanding is firm in this respect, _viz_., that I will live obedient to the sway of the Ordainer. It is seen that some one of noble birth, possessed of handsome features, and endued with great prowess, lives in misery, with all his counsellors and friends. This happens because of its having been ordained. [^339] Similarly, some one born in an ignoble race, devoid of knowledge, and with even a stain on his birth, is seen, O Sakra, to live in happiness with all his counsellors and friends.

<span id="p132"><sup><small>[ p. 132 ]</small></sup></span>

This also happens because of its having been ordained. An auspicious and beautiful woman, O Sakra, is seen to pass her life in misery. Similarly, an ugly woman with every inauspicious mark is seen to pass her days in great happiness. That we have now become so is not due to any act of ours, O Sakra! That thou art now so is not due, O wielder of the thunderbolt, to any act of thine. Thou hast not done anything, O thou of hundred sacrifices, in consequence of which thou art now enjoying this affluence. Nor have I done anything in consequence of which I have now been divested of affluence, Affluence and its reverse come one after another. I now behold thee blazing with splendour, endued with prosperity, possessed of beauty, placed at the head of all the deities, and thus roaring at me. This would never be but for the fact of Time standing near after having assailed me. Indeed, if Time had not assailed me I would have today killed thee with only a blow of my fists notwithstanding the fact of thy being armed with the thunder. This, however, is not the time for putting forth my prowess. On the other hand, the time that has come is for adopting a behaviour of peace and tranquillity. It is Time that establishes all things. Time works upon all things and leads them to their final consummation. [^340] I was the worshipped lord of the Danavas. Burning all with my energy, I used to roar in strength and pride. When Time hath assailed even myself, who is there whom he will not assail? Formerly, O chief of the deities, singly I bore the energy of all the twelve illustrious Adityas with thyself amongst them. It was I that used to bear up water and then to shower it as rain, O Vasava! It was I that used to give both light and heat unto the three worlds. It was I that used to protect and it was I that used to destroy. It was I that gave and it was I that took. It was I that used to bind and it was I that used to unbind. In all the worlds I was the one puissant master. That sovereign sway which I had, O chief of the celestials, is no more. I am now assailed by the forces of Time. Those things, therefore, are no longer seen to shine in me. I am not the doer (of acts that are apparently done by me). Thou art not the doer (of acts done by thee). None else, O lord of Sachi, is the doer (of those acts). It is Time, O Sakra, that protects or destroys all things. [^341] Persons conversant with the Vedas say that Time (Eternity) is _Brahma_. The fortnights and months are his body. That body is invested with days and nights as its robes. The seasons are his senses. The year is his mouth. Some people, in consequence of their superior intelligence, say that all this (the entire universe) should be conceived as Brahma. The Vedas, however, teach, that the five sheaths that invest the Soul should be regarded as Brahma. Brahma is deep and inaccessible like a vast ocean of waters. It hath been said that it hath neither beginning nor end, and that it is both indestructible and destructible. [^342] Though it is without attributes by itself, yet it enters all existent objects and as such assumes attributes. Those <span id="p133"><sup><small>[ p. 133 ]</small></sup></span> persons that are conversant with truth regard Brahma as eternal. Through the action of Ignorance, Brahma causes the attributes of materiality to invest the _Chit_ or Soul which is immaterial spirit (having knowledge only for its attribute). That materiality, however, is not the essential attribute of the Soul, for upon the appearance of a knowledge of the true cause of everything, that materiality ceases to invest the Soul. [^343] Brahma in the form of Time is the refuge of all creatures. Where wouldst thou go transcending that Time? Time or Brahma, indeed, cannot be avoided by running nor by staying still. All the five senses are incapable of perceiving Brahma. Some have said that Brahma is Fire; some that he is Prajapati; some that he is the Seasons; some that he is the Month; some that he is the Fortnight; some that he is the Days; some that he is the Hours; some that he is the Morning; some that he is the Noon; some that he is the Evening; and some that he is the Moment. Thus diverse people speak diversely of him who is single. Know that he is Eternity, under whose sway are all things. Many thousands of Indras have passed away, O Vasava, each of whom was possessed of great strength and prowess. Thou also, O lord of Sachi, shalt have to pass away after the same manner. Thee, too, O Sakra, that art possessed of swelling might and that art the chief of the deities, when thy hour comes, all-powerful Time will extinguish! Time sweeps away all things. For this reason, O Indra, do not brag. Time is incapable of being quieted by either thee or me or by those gone before us. This regal prosperity that thou hast attained and that thou thinkest to be beyond comparison, had formerly been possessed by me. It is unsubstantial and unreal. She does not dwell long in one place. Indeed, she had dwelt in thousands of Indras before thee, all of whom, again, were very much superior to thee. Unstable as she is, deserting me she hath now approached thee, O chief of the deities! Do not, O Sakra, indulge in such brag again. It behoveth thee to become tranquil. Knowing thee to be full of vanity, she will very soon desert thee.’”

“Bhishma said, ‘After this, he of hundred sacrifices beheld the goddess of Prosperity, in her own embodied form that blazed splendour, issue out of the form of the high-souled Vali. The illustrious chastiser of Paka, beholding the goddess blazing with radiance, addressed Vali in these words, with eyes expanded in wonder.’

“Sakra said, ‘O Vali, who is this one, thus shining with splendour, thus decked with head plumes, thus adorned with golden bracelets on her upper <span id="p134"><sup><small>[ p. 134 ]</small></sup></span> arms, and thus emitting a halo of glory on all sides in consequence of her energy that is issuing out of thy body.’

“Vali said, ‘I do not know whether she is an _Asura_ damsel or a celestial one or a human one. Thou mayst not ask her thyself. Do what pleases thee.’

“Sakra said, ‘O thou of sweet smiles, who art thou that art possessed of such radiance and adorned with plumes that thus issuest from the body of Vali. I do not know thee. Kindly tell me thy name. Who, indeed, art thou that thus standest here as Maya herself, blazing with thy own splendour, after having deserted the lord of the _Daityas_? O, tell me this as I question thee.’

“Sree said, ‘Virochana did not know me. This Vali also that is the son of Virochana knows me not. The learned called me by the name of _Duhshaha_. [^344] Some knew me by the name of _Vidhitsa_. [^345] I have other names also, O Vasava! They are _Bhuti_, _Lakshmi_, and _Sree_. [^346] Thou knowest me not, O Sakra, nor doth any one among the deities know me.’

“Sakra said, ‘O lady that is difficult of being borne, why do you desert Vali now after having lived in him for a long time? Is it due to any act of mine or is it due to any act that Vali has done?’

“Sree said, ‘Neither the Creator nor the Ordainer rules me. It is Time that moves me from one place to another. Do not, O Sakra, disregard Vali.’

“Sakra said, ‘For what reason, O goddess adorned with plumes, do you desert Vali? Why also do you approach me (for living in me)? Tell me this, O thou of sweet smiles!’

‘Sree said, ‘I live in truth, in gifts, in good vows, in penances, in prowess, and in virtue. Vali hath fallen off from all these. Formerly, he was devoted to the Brahmanas. He was truthful and had controlled his passions. Latterly, however, he began to cherish feelings of animosity towards the Brahmanas and touched clarified butter with soiled hands. [^347] Formerly, he was always engaged in the performance of sacrifices. At last, blinded by ignorance and afflicted by Time he began to boast before all persons, saying that his adorations towards me were ceaseless. Deserting him (for these faults) I shall henceforth, O Sakra, dwell in thee. Thou shouldst bear me without heedlessness, and with penances and prowess.’

“Sakra said, ‘O thou that dwellest amid lotuses, there is not a single person among gods, men, and all creatures, that can bear thee for ever.’

“Sree said, ‘Truly, O Purandara, there is none among gods, _Gandharvas_, _Asuras_, or _Rakshasas_, that can bear me for ever.’

“Sakra said, ‘O auspicious lady, tell me how I should conduct myself so that thou mayst dwell in me always. I shall certainly obey thy behests. It behoveth thee to answer me truly.’

“Sree said, ‘O chief of the deities, I shall tell thee as to how I may be <span id="p135"><sup><small>[ p. 135 ]</small></sup></span> enabled to dwell in thee always. Divide me into four parts according to the ordinance laid down in the Vedas.’

“Sakra said, ‘I shall assign the habitations according to their strength and power in bearing thee. As regards myself, I shall always take care, O Lakshmi, that I may not offend thee in any way. Amongst men, the earth, that progenitrix of all things, bear them all. She shall bear a fourth part of thyself. I think she hath the strength to do it.’

“Sree said, ‘Here, I yield up a quarter of myself. Let it be established on the earth. Do thou, after this, make a proper disposition, O Sakra, for my second quarter.’

“Sakra said, ‘The waters, among men, in their liquid form, do various services to human beings. Let the waters bear a fourth part of thy person. They have the strength to bear a portion of thine.’

“Sree said, ‘I yield up another quarter of mine that is to be established in the waters. Do thou, after this, O Sakra, assign a proper place for my third quarter.’

“Sakra said, ‘The Vedas, the sacrifices, and the deities are all established in Fire. Fire will bear thy third quarter, when it is placed therein.’

“Sree said, ‘Here I yield up my third quarter which is to be placed in Fire. Do thou, O Sakra, after this, assign a proper place for my last quarter.’

“Sakra said, ‘They that are good among men, devoted to Brahmanas, and truthful in speech, may bear thy fourth quarter. The good have the power to bear it.’

“Sree said, ‘Here I yield up my fourth quarter that is to be placed among the good. My portions thus assigned to different creatures, do thou continue to protect me, O Sakra.’

“Sakra said, ‘Listen to these words of mine. I have thus distributed thee among different creatures. Those among creatures that will offend against thee shall be chastised by me. The chief of the _Daityas_, _viz_., Vali, thus deserted by Sree, then said these words.’

“Vali said, ‘At present the Sun shines as much in the east as in the west, and as much in the north as in the south. When, however, the Sun, withdrawing himself from all sides, will shine only upon the region of Brahman situated in the middle of Sumeru, then will again occur a great battle between the gods and the _Asuras_, and in that fight I shall certainly vanquish all of you. When the Sun, withdrawing himself from all sides, will shine fixedly upon only the region of Brahman, then will again occur a great battle between the gods and the _Asuras_, and in that fight I shall surely conquer all of you.’ [^348]

“Sakra said, ‘Brahman hath commanded me saying that I should never <span id="p136"><sup><small>[ p. 136 ]</small></sup></span> kill thee. It is for this reason, O Vali, that I do not hurl my thunderbolt upon thy head. Go whithersoever thou wishest, O chief of the _Daityas_! O great _Asura_, peace to thee! No time will come when the Sun will shine from only the meridian. The Self-born (Brahman) hath before this ordained the laws that regulate the Sun's motions. Giving light and heat to all creatures, he goes on ceaselessly. For six months he travels in a northward course and then for the other six in a southward course. The sun travels by these courses (one after another), creating winter and summer for all creatures.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus addressed by Indra, O Bharata, Vali, the chief of the _Daityas_, proceeded towards the south. Purandara proceeded towards the north. The thousand-eyed Indra, after having listened to this speech of Vali which was characterised by an entire absence of pride, then ascended the skies.’


## SECTION CCXXVI

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is also cited the old narrative of the discourse between him of a hundred sacrifices and the _Asura_ Namuchi, O Yudhishthira. When the _Asura_ Namuchi, who was conversant with the birth and the death of all creatures, was sitting, divested of prosperity but untroubled at heart like the vast ocean in perfect stillness, Purandara addressed him these: words, ‘Fallen off from thy place, bound with cords, brought under the sway of thy foes, and divested of prosperity, dost thou, O Namuchi, indulge in grief or passest thou thy days cheerfully?’

“Namuchi answered, ‘By indulging in such sorrow as cannot be warded off one only wastes one's body and gladdens one's foes. Then, again, no one can lighten another's sorrow by taking any portion of it upon oneself. For these reasons, O Sakra, I do not indulge in sorrow. All this that thou seest hath one end. [^349] Indulgence in sorrow destroys personal comeliness, prosperity, life, and virtue itself, O chief of the deities! Without doubt, suppressing that sorrow which comes upon oneself and which is born of an improper disposition of the mind, one possessed of true knowledge should reflect in one's mind of that which is productive of the highest good and which dwells in the heart itself. [^350] When one sets one's mind upon what is for one's highest good, without doubt, the result that takes place is that one's objects are all accomplished. [^351] There is One Ordainer, and no second. His control extends over the <span id="p137"><sup><small>[ p. 137 ]</small></sup></span> being that lies within the womb. Controlled by the great Ordainer I go on as He sets me on, like water running along a downward path. Knowing what is existence and what is emancipation, and understanding also that the latter is superior to the former, I do not, however, strive for attaining to it. Doing acts that tend towards the direction of virtue and also those that tend towards the opposite direction, I go on as He sets me on. One gets those things that are ordained to be got. That which is to happen actually happens. One has repeatedly to reside in such wombs in which one is placed by the Ordainer. One has no choice in the matter. That person is never stupefied, who when placed in any particular condition, accepts it as that which he was ordained to be placed in. Men are affected by pleasure and pain that come by turns in course of Time. There is no personal agency (in the matter of pleasure or pain to any one). In this lies sorrow, _viz_., that he that dislikes sorrow regards himself as the actor. [^352] Amongst _Rishis_, gods, great _Asuras_, persons fully conversant with the three Vedas, and ascetics in the forest, who is there whom calamities do not approach? Those, however, that are conversant with the Soul and that which is not-Soul never fear calamities. The person of wisdom, naturally standing immovable like Himavat, never gives way to wrath; never suffers himself to be attached to the objects of the senses; never languishes in sorrow or rejoices in happiness. When overwhelmed with even great afflictions, such a person never gives way to grief. That person is a very superior one whom even great success cannot gladden and even dire calamities cannot afflict, and who bears pleasure and pain, and that which is between them both, with an unmoved heart. Into whatever condition a person may fall, he should summon cheerfulness without yielding to sorrow. Indeed, even thus should one drive off from one's self one's swelling grief that is born in one's mind and that is (if not dispelled) sure to give pain. That assembly of learned persons engaged in the discussion of duties based upon both the _Srutis_ and the _Smritis_ is not a good assembly,—indeed, that does not deserve to be called by the name of assembly,—entering which a wicked man does not become penetrated with fear (born of his wicked deeds). That man is the foremost of his species who having dived into and enquired after righteousness succeeds in acting according to the conclusions to which he arrives. [^353] The acts of a wise man are not easily comprehensible. He that is wise, is never Stupefied when afflictions come upon him. Even if he falls away from his position like Gautama in his old age, in consequence of the direct calamity, he does not suffer himself to be stupefied. [^354] By any of these, _viz_., _mantras_, <span id="p138"><sup><small>[ p. 138 ]</small></sup></span> strength, energy, wisdom, prowess, behaviour, conduct, or the affluence of wealth, can a person acquire that which has not been ordained to be acquired by him? What sorrow then is there for the non-acquisition of that upon which one has set one's heart? Before I was born, they that have the matter in their hands had ordained what I am to do and suffer. I am fulfilling what was thus ordained for me. What then can death do to me? One obtains only that which has been ordained to be obtained. One goes thither whither it was ordained that one is to go. Those sorrows and joys are obtained that are ordained to be obtained. That man who knowing this fully, does not suffer himself to be stupefied, and who is contented under both happiness and sorrow, is regarded as the foremost of his species.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘What, indeed, is good for a man that is sunk in dire distress, when loss of friends or loss of kingdom, O monarch has occurred? In this world, O bull of Bharata's race, thou art the foremost of our instructors. I ask thee this. It behoveth thee to tell me what I ask.’

“Bhishma said, ‘For one that has been deprived of sons and wives and pleasures of every kind and wealth, and that has been plunged into dire distress, fortitude is of the highest good, O king! The body is never emaciated of one that is always possessed of fortitude. Grieflessness bears happiness within it, and also health that is a superior possession. In consequence again of this health of body, once may again acquire prosperity. That wise man, O sire, who adheres to a course of righteous conduct (while afflicted by distress) succeeds in acquiring prosperity, patience, and perseverance in the accomplishment of all his objects. In this connection is once more cited the old narrative of the discourse between Vali and Vasava, O Yudhishthira! After the battle between the gods and the _Asuras_, in which a large number of _Daityas_ and _Danavas_ fell, had come to an end. Vali became king. He was deceived by Vishnu who once more established his sway over all the worlds. He, of a hundred sacrifices was once more invested with the sovereignty of the deities. After the rule of the deities had thus been re-established, and the four orders of men had been re-established in the practice of their respective courses of duty, the three worlds once more swelled with prosperity, and the Self-born became glad at heart. At that time, accompanied by the Rudras, the Vasus, <span id="p139"><sup><small>[ p. 139 ]</small></sup></span> the Adityas, the Aswins, the celestial _Rishis_, the _Gandharvas_, the _Siddhas_, and other superior orders of beings, the puissant Sakra, seated in splendour on his four-tusked prince of elephants, called Airavata, made a progress through all the worlds. One day, while thus engaged, the wielder of the thunderbolt beheld Virochana's son Vali within a certain mountain cave on the sea-shore. Seeing the prince of _Danavas_, he approached him. Beholding the chief of the deities, _viz_., Indra, thus seated on the back of Airavata and surrounded by the several orders of the celestials, the prince of the _Daityas_ showed no signs of sorrow or agitation. Indra also, seeing Vali staying unmoved and fearless, addressed him from the back of his foremost of elephants, saying, ‘How is it, O Daitya, that thou art so unmoved? Is it due to thy heroism or thy having waited with reverence upon aged persons? Is it due to thy mind having been cleansed by penances? To whatever cause it may be due, this frame of mind is certainly very difficult of attainment. Hurled from a position that was certainly the highest, thou art now divested of all thy possessions, and thou hast been brought under the sway of thy foes. O son of Virochana, what is that by having recourse to which thou dost not grieve although the occasion is for grief? Formerly, when thou wert invested with the sovereignty of thy own order, unrivalled pleasures were thine. Now, however, thou art divested of thy wealth and jewels and sovereignty. Tell us why thou art so unmoved. Thou wert before this a god, seated on the throne of thy sire and grandsires. Beholding thyself stripped today by thy foes, why dost thou not grieve? Thou art bound in Varuna's noose and hast been struck with my thunderbolt. Thy wives have been taken away and thy wealth also. Tell us why thou dost not indulge in grief. Divested of prosperity and fallen away from affluence, thou indulgest not in grief. This, indeed, is something that is very remarkable. Who else, O Vali, than one like thee, could venture to bear the burthen of existence after being shorn of the sovereignty of the three worlds?‘ Hearing without any pain these and other cutting speeches that Indra addressed to him, asserting the while his own superiority over him, Vali, the son of Virochana, fearlessly answered his interrogator, saying the following words.’

“Vali said, ‘When calamities have oppressed me, O Sakra, what dost thou gain by such brag now? Today I behold thee, O Purandara, stand before me with the thunderbolt upraised in thy hand! Formerly, however, thou couldst not bear thyself so. Now thou hast by some means gained that power. Indeed, who else than thou could utter such cruel speeches? That person who, though able to punish, shows compassion towards a heroic foe vanquished and brought under his sway, is truly a very superior individual. When two persons fight, victory in the battle is certainly dubious. One of the two certainly becomes victorious, and the other becomes vanquished. O chief of the deities, let not thy disposition be such! Do not imagine that thou hast become the sovereign of all creatures after having conquered all with thy might and prowess! That we have become so is not, O Sakra, the result of any act of ours. [^355] That thou hast become so, O wielder of the thunderbolt, <span id="p140"><sup><small>[ p. 140 ]</small></sup></span> is not the result of any act of thine. What I am now thou wilt be in the future. Do not disregard me, thinking that thou hast done an exceedingly difficult feat. A person obtains happiness and misery one after another in course of Time. Thou hast, O Sakra, obtained the sovereignty of the universe in course of Time but not in consequence of any especial merit in thee. It is Time that leads me on in his course. That same Time leads thee also onward. It is for this that I am not what thou art today, and thou also art not what we are! Dutiful services done to parents, reverential worship of deities, due practice of any good quality,—none of these can bestow happiness on any one. Neither knowledge, nor penances, nor gifts, nor friends, nor kinsmen can rescue one that is afflicted by Time. Men are incapable of averting, by even a thousand means, an impending calamity. Intelligence and strength go for nothing in such cases. There is no rescuer of men that are afflicted by Time's course. That thou, O Sakra, regarded thyself as the actor lies at the root of all sorrow. If the ostensible doer of an act is the real actor thereof, that doer then would not himself be the work of some one else (_viz_., the Supreme Being). Hence, because the ostensible doer is himself the product of another, that another is the Supreme Being above whom there is nothing higher. Aided by Time I had vanquished thee. Aided by Time thou hast vanquished me. It is Time that is the mover of all beings that move. It is Time that destroys all beings. O Indra, in consequence of thy intelligence being of the vulgar species thou seest not that destruction awaits all things. Some, indeed, regard thee highly as one that has acquired by his own acts the sovereignty of the universe. For all that, how can one like us that know the course of the world, indulge in grief in consequence of having been afflicted by Time, or suffer our understanding to be stupefied, or yield to the influence of error? Shall my understanding or that of one like me, even when we are overwhelmed by Time, coming in contact with a calamity, suffer itself to be destroyed like a wrecked vessel at sea? [^356] Myself, thyself, and all those who will in future become the chiefs of the deities, shall have, O Sakra, to go the way along which hundreds of Indras have gone before thee. When thy hour matures itself, Time will surely destroy thee like me,—thee that art now so invincible and that now blazest with unrivalled splendour. In Time's course many thousands of Indras and of deities have been swept off _yuga_ after _yuga_. Time, indeed, is irresistible. Having attained to thy present position, thou regardest thyself very highly, even as the Creator of all beings, the divine and eternal Brahman. This position of thine had been attained by many before thee. With none did it prove stable or unending. In consequence, however, of a foolish understanding, thou alone regardest it to be immutable and eternal. Thou trustest in that which is not deserving of trust. Thou deemest that to be eternal which is not eternal. O chief of the deities, one that is overwhelmed and stupefied by Time really regards oneself after this manner. Led by folly thou regardest thy present regal prosperity to be thine. Know, however, that it is never <span id="p141"><sup><small>[ p. 141 ]</small></sup></span> stable in respect of either thee or me or others. It had belonged to innumerable persons before thee. Passing over them, it has now become thine. It will stay with thee, O Vasava, for some time and then prove its instability. Like a cow abandoning one drinking ditch for another, it will surely desert thee for somebody else. So many sovereigns have gone before thee that I venture not to make an enumeration. In the future also, O Purandara, innumerable sovereigns will rise after thee. I do not behold those rulers now that had formerly enjoyed this earth with her trees and plants and gems and living creatures and waters and mines. Prithu, Aila, Maya, Bhima, Naraka, Samvara, Aswagriva, Puloman, Swarbhanu, whose standard was of immeasurable height, Prahlada, Namuchi, Daksha, Vipprachitti, Virochana, Hrinisheva, Suhotra, Bhurihan, Pushavat, Vrisha, Satyepsu, Rishava, Vahu, Kapilaswa, Virupaka, Vana, Kartaswara, Vahni, Viswadanshtra, Nairiti, Sankocha, Varitaksha, Varaha, Aswa, Ruchiprabha, Viswajit, Pratirupa, Vrishanda, Vishkara, Madhu, Hiranyakasipu, the Danava Kaitabha, and many others that were _Daityas_ and _Danavas_ and Rakshasas, these and many more unnamed, belonging to remote and remoter ages, great _Daityas_ and foremost of _Danavas_, whose names we have heard,—indeed, many foremost of _Daityas_ of former times,—having gone away, leaving the Earth. All of them were afflicted by Time. Time proved stronger than all of them. All of them had worshipped the Creator in hundreds of sacrifices. Thou art not the one person that hast done so. All of them were devoted to righteousness and all of them always performed great sacrifices. All of them were capable of roaming through the skies, and all were heroes that never showed their backs in battle. All of them had very strong frames and all had arms that resembled heavy bludgeons. All of them were masters of hundreds of illusions, and all could assume any form they wished. We have never heard that having engaged themselves in battle any of them had ever sustained a defeat. All were firm observers of the vow of truth, and all of them sported as they wished. Devoted to the Vedas and Vedic rites, all of them were possessors of great learning. Possessed of great might, all of them had acquired the highest prosperity and affluence. But none of those high-souled sovereigns had the least tincture of pride in consequence of sovereignty. All of them were liberal, giving unto each what each deserved. All of them behaved properly and duly towards all creatures. All of them were the offspring of Daksha's daughters. Endued with great strength, all were lords of the creation. Scorching all things with the energy all of them blazed with splendour. Yet all of them were swept off by time. As regards thee, O Sakra, it is evident that when thou shalt have, after enjoying the earth, to leave her, thou wilt not be able to control thy grief. Cast off this desire that thou cherishest for objects of affection and enjoyment. Cast off this pride that is born of prosperity. If thou actest in this manner, thou wilt then be able to bear the grief that attends the loss of sovereignty. When the hour of sorrow comes, do not yield to sorrow. Similarly, when the hour of joy comes, do not rejoice. Disregarding both the past and the future, live contentedly with the present. When Time that never sleeps came upon me that had always been heedful of my duties, <span id="p142"><sup><small>[ p. 142 ]</small></sup></span> turn thy heart to the ways of peace, O Indra, for that same Time will very soon come over thee! Thou piercest me with thy words, and thou seemest to be bent upon inspiring dread in me. Indeed, finding me collected, thou regardest thy own self very highly. Time had first assailed me. It is even now behind thee. I was at first vanquished by Time. It was for that reason that thou didst afterwards succeed in vanquishing me for which thou roarest in pride thus. Formerly, when I happened to become angry, what person was there on earth that could stand before me in battle? Time, however, is stronger. He has overwhelmed me. It is for this reason, O Vasava, that thou art able to stand before me! Those thousand (celestial years), that are the measure of thy sway, will surely come to an end. Thou shalt then fall and thy limbs will become as miserable as mine now even though I am possessed of mighty energy. I have fallen away from the high place that is occupied by the sovereign of the three worlds. Thou art now the actual Indra in heaven. In this delightful world of living beings, thou art now, in consequence of Time's course, an object of universal adoration. Canst thou say what is that by having done which thou hast become Indra today and what also is that by having done which we have fallen off from the position we had? Time is the one creator and destroyer. Nothing else is cause (in the universe for the production of any effect). Decline, fall, sovereignty, happiness, misery, birth and death,—a learned person by encountering any of these neither rejoices nor indulges in sorrow. Thou, O Indra, knowest us. We also, O Vasava, know thee. Why then dost thou brag in this fashion before me, forgetting, O shameless one, that it is Time that hath made thee what thou art? Thou didst thyself witness what my prowess was in those days. The energy and might I used to display in all my battles, furnish sufficient evidence. The Adityas, the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Vasus, and the Maruts, O lord of Sachi, were all vanquished by me. Thou knowest it well thyself, O Sakra, that in the great encounter between the gods and the _Asuras_, the assembled deities were quickly routed by me by the fury of my attack. Mountains with their forests and the denizens that lived in those forests, were repeatedly hurled by us. Many were the mountain summits with craggy edges that I broke on thy head. What, however, can I do now? Time is incapable of being resisted. If it were not so, do not think that I would not have ventured to kill thee with that thunderbolt of thine with even a blow of my fist. The present, however, is not the hour with me for the display of prowess. The hour that hath come is such that I should adopt tranquillity now and tolerate everything. It is for this reason, O Sakra, that I put up with all this insolence of thine. Know, however, that I am less able to bear insolence than even thou. Thou braggest before one who, upon his time having matured, is surrounded on all sides by Time's conflagration and bound strongly in Time's cords. Yonder stands that dark individual who is incapable of being resisted by the world. Of fierce form, he stands there, having bound me like an inferior animal bound with cords. Gain and loss, happiness and misery, lust and wrath, birth and death, captivity and release,—these all one encounters in Time's course. I am not the actor. Thou art not the actor. He is the actor who, indeed, is omnipotent. That Time ripens <span id="p143"><sup><small>[ p. 143 ]</small></sup></span> me (for throwing me down) like a fruit that has appeared on a tree. There are certain acts by doing which one person obtains happiness in Time's course. By doing those very acts another obtains misery in the course of Time. Versed as I am with the virtues of Time, it behoves me not to indulge in grief when it is Time that has assailed me. It is for this reason, O Sakra, that I do not grieve. Grief cannot do us any good. The grief of one that indulges in grief never dispels one's calamity. On the other hand, grief destroys one's power. It is for this that I do not indulge in grief.’

“Thus addressed by the chief of the _Daityas_, he of a hundred sacrifices, _viz_., the puissant and thousand-eyed chastiser of Paka, restrained his wrath and said these words.’

“Sakra said, ‘Beholding this upraised arm of mine, equipped with the thunderbolt, and those nooses of Varuna, who is there whose understanding would not be agitated, including the very Destroyer himself that compasses the death of all beings? Thy understanding, however, so firm and so endued with vision of the truth, hath not been agitated. O thou of invincible prowess, verily, thou art unmoved today in consequence of thy fortitude. Beholding all things in this universe to be fleeting, who is there in it, endued with body, that would venture to repose confidence on either his body or all the objects of his desire? Like thyself I also know that this universe is not eternal, and that it has been thrown into Time's conflagration that is dreadful though hidden from the view, that is continuously burning, and that is truly endless. Every one is assailed here by Time. Nothing among beings that are subtile or gross enjoys an immunity from Time's sway. All things are being cooked in Time's cauldron. Time has no master. Time is ever heedful. Time is always cooking all things within itself. No one who has once entered the domain of Time which is ceaselessly going on, can escape therefrom. All embodied beings may be heedless of Time, but Time is heedful and is broad awake behind them. No one has ever been seen to have driven off Time from him. Ancient and eternal, and the embodiment of justice, Time is uniform in respect of all living creatures. Time cannot be avoided, and there is no retrogression in its course. Like a usurer adding up his interest, Time adds up its subtile portions represented by _kalas_, and _lavas_, and _kashthas_, and _kshanas_, and months, and days and nights. Like the current of a river washing away a tree whose roots are reached by it, Time, getting at him who says, ‘_This I will do today but this other act I will do tomorrow_’ sweeps him away. Time sweeps away one and men exclaim, ‘_I saw him a little while ago. How has he died_?’ Wealth, comforts, rank, prosperity, all fall a prey to Time. Approaching every living creature, Time snatches away his life. All things that proudly raise their heads high are destined to fall down. That which is existent is only another form of the non-existent. Everything is transitory and unstable. Such a conviction is, however, difficult to come at. Thy understanding, so firm and endued with true vision, is unmoved. Thou dost not, even mentally, realise what thou wert some time ago. Time that is strong, assailing the universe, cooks it within itself and sweeps away everything without consideration of seniority of years or the reverse. For all that, one that is <span id="p144"><sup><small>[ p. 144 ]</small></sup></span> being dragged by Time is unconscious of the noose thrown round one's neck. People, given to jealousy and vanity and cupidity to lust, wrath, and fear, to desire, heedlessness, and pride, suffer themselves to be stupefied. Thou, however, art acquainted with the truth of existence. Thou art possessed of learning and endued with wisdom and penance. Thou beholdest Time as clearly as if it were an emblic myrobalan on the palm of thy hand. O son of Virochana, fully conversant art thou with the topic of Time's conduct. Thou art well-versed in all branches of knowledge. Thou art of cleansed Soul and a thorough master of thy persons. Thou art, for this, an object of affection with all persons endued with wisdom. Thou hast, with thy understanding, fully comprehended the whole universe. Though thou hast enjoyed every kind of happiness, thou art never attached to anything, and hence thou hast not been stained by anything. The qualities of Passion and Darkness do not soil thee for thou hast conquered thy senses. Thou waitest only upon thy Soul which is divested of both joy and sorrow. The friend of all creatures, without animosity, with thy heart set upon tranquillity, beholding thee thus, my heart is inclined to compassion towards thee. I do not desire to afflict an enlightened person like thee by keeping him in an enchained condition. Abstention from injury is the highest religion. I feel compassion towards thee. These nooses of Varuna, with which thou hast been bound, will loosen Time's course in consequence of the misconduct of men. Blessed be thou, O great _Asura_! When the daughter-in-law will set the aged mother-in-law to work, when the son, through delusion, will command the sire to work for him, when Sudras will have their feet washed by Brahmanas and have sexual congress fearlessly with women of regenerate families, when men will discharge the vital seed into forbidden wombs, when the refuse of houses will begin to be carried upon plates and vessels made of white brass, and when sacrificial offerings intended for the deities will begin to be borne upon forbidden vessels, when all the four orders will transgress all restraints, then these bonds of thine will begin one by one, to loosen. From us thou hast no fear. Wait quietly. Be happy. Be divested of all sorrow. Let thy heart be cheerful. Let no illness be thine.‘ Having said these words unto him, the divine Indra, having the prince of elephants for his vehicle, left that spot. Having vanquished all the _Asuras_, the chief of the deities rejoiced in gladness and became the one sole lord of all the worlds. The great _Rishis_ hymned the praises of that lord of all mobile and immobile creatures. The deity of fire once more began to bear the libations of clarified butter that were poured (by all) into his visible form, and the great god took charge of the nectar that was committed to his care. His praises hymned by the foremost of Brahmanas engaged in sacrifices, the lord Indra, blazing with splendour, his wrath pacified, and his heart tranquillised, became gladdened, and returning to his own abode in heaven, began to pass his days in great happiness.’” [^357]

## SECTION CCXXVIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, the indications of future greatness and future fall in respect of a person.’

“Bhishma said, ‘The mind itself, blessed be thou, indicates the premonitory symptoms of one's future prosperity and future fall. In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse between Sree and Sakra. Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! The great ascetic Narada, of energy whose effulgence is as immeasurable as _Brahma_ itself, with sins all destroyed, capable of beholding through the prosperity of his penances both this and the other world at once, and the equal of the celestial _Rishis_ in the region of the Creator, roved according to his pleasure through the triple world. One day, rising up at dawn, he wished to perform his ablutions, and for that purpose went to the river Ganga as she issued out of the pass known by the name of Dhruva and plunged into the stream. [^358] At that time the thousand-eyed Indra also, the wielder of the thunderbolt, and the slayer of Samvara and Paka, came to the very bank where Narada was. The _Rishi_ and the deity, both of souls under perfect command, finished their ablutions, and having completed their silent recitations, sat together. They employed the hour in reciting and listening to the excellent narratives told by the great celestial _Rishis_ descriptive of many good and high deeds. Indeed, with concentrated attention the two were engaged in such pleasant discourse on ancient history. [^359] While sitting there they beheld the rising Sun casting his thousand rays right before him. Seeing the full orb, both of them stood up and hymned his praises. Just at that time they beheld in the sky, in a direction opposite to that of the rising star of day, some luminous object, resplendent as blazing fire and that seemed to be a second star of day. And they saw, O Bharata, that that luminous object was gradually approaching towards them both. Riding upon Vishnu's vehicle adorned with Garuda and Surya himself, that object blazed forth with unrivalled splendour, and seemed to illumine the three worlds. The object they saw was none other than Sree herself, attended by many _Apsaras_ endued with splendid beauty. Indeed, she looked like a large solar disc herself, possessed of effulgence resembling that of fire. Adorned with ornaments that looked like veritable stars, she wore a wreath that resembled a garland of pearls. Indra saw that goddess called Padma having her habitation in the midst of lotuses. Descending from her foremost of cars, that unrivalled lady began to approach <span id="p146"><sup><small>[ p. 146 ]</small></sup></span> towards the lord of the three worlds and the celestial _Rishi_ Narada. Followed by Narada, Maghavat also proceeded towards that lady. With joined hands, he offered himself up to her, and versed as he was with all things, he worshipped her with reverence and sincerity never surpassed. The adorations over, the lord of celestials, O king, addressed Sree in the following words.’

“Sakra said, ‘O thou of sweet smiles, who, indeed, art thou and for what business hast thou come here? O thou of fair brows, whence dost thou come and whither wilt thou proceed, O auspicious lady?’

“Sree said, ‘In the three worlds full of the seeds of auspiciousness, all creatures, mobile and immobile, strive with their whole hearts to win an association with me. I am that Padma, that Sree decked with lotuses, who sprang from the lotus that blooms at the touch of the rays of Surya, for the prosperity of all creatures. I am called Lakshmi, Bhuti, and Sree, O slayer of Vala! I am Faith, I am Intelligence, I am Affluence, I am Victory, and I am Immutability. I am Patience, I am Success, I am Prosperity. I am Swaha, I am Swadha, I am Reverence, I am Fate, and I am Memory. I dwell at the van and on the standards of victorious and virtuous sovereigns, as also in their homes and cities and dominions. I always reside, O slayer of Vala, with those foremost of men, _viz_., heroes panting after victory and unretreating from battle. I also reside for ever with persons that are firmly attached to virtue, that are endued with great intelligence, that are devoted to Brahma, that are truthful in speech, that are possessed of humility, and that are liberal. Formerly, I dwelt with the _Asuras_ in consequence of my disposition of being bound by truth and merit Seeing, however, that the _Asuras_ have assumed adverse natures, I have left then and wish to reside in thee.’

“Sakra said, ‘O thou of fair face, in consequence of what behaviour of the _Asuras_ didst thou dwell with them? What didst thou see there for which thou hast come hither, having deserted the _Daityas_ and the _Danavas_?’

“Sree said, I attach myself steadfastly to those that are devoted to the duties of their own order, to those that never fall away from patience, to those that take a pleasure in walking along the path which leads to heaven. I always reside with those that are distinguished for liberality, for study of the scriptures, for sacrifices, for other scriptural rites, and for worship of _Pitris_, deities, preceptors, seniors, and guests. Formerly, the Danavas used to keep their abodes clean, to keep their women under control, to pour libations on the sacrificial fire, to wait dutifully on their preceptors, to restrain their passions, to be obedient to the Brahmanas, and to be truthful in speech. They were full of faith; they kept their wrath under control; they practised the virtue of charity; they never envied others; they used to maintain their friends and advisers, and their spouses; they were never jealous. Formerly, they never assailed one another, filled with wrath. They were all contented and never felt pain at the sight of other people's affluence and prosperity. They were all charitable and economical; of respectable conduct, and endued with compassion. They were excessively inclined to grace, possessed of simplicity of conduct, steadfast in faith, and had their passions under complete control. They used to keep their servants and <span id="p147"><sup><small>[ p. 147 ]</small></sup></span> counsellors contented, and were grateful and endued with sweet speech. They used to serve every one as each deserved in consequence of his position and honour. They were endued with shame. They were of rigid vows. They used to perform their ablutions on every sacred day. They used to smear themselves properly with perfumes and suspicious unguents. They were also to adorn their persons duly. They were observant of fasts and penances, were trustful, and utterers of Vedic hymns. The Sun never rose upon them while they lay asleep. They never outslept the moon. They always abstained from curds and pounded barley. They used every morning to look at clarified butter and other auspicious articles, and with senses withdrawn they used to recite the Vedas and worship Brahmanas with gifts. Their discourse was always virtuous, and they never accepted gifts. They always went to sleep at midnight and never slept during the day. They always used to take pleasure in showing compassion for the distressed, the helpless, the aged, the weak, the sick, and women, and enjoyed all their possessions by sharing these with them. They always used to assume and comfort the agitated, the cheerless, the anxious, the terrified, the diseased, the weak and emaciated, the robbed, and the afflicted. They followed the dictates of virtue and never injured one another. They were ready and well-disposed for action of every kind (that deserved to be accomplished). They used to serve and wait with reverence upon seniors and aged individuals. They duly worshipped _Pitris_, deities, and guests, and ate every day what was left after gratifying these. They were firmly devoted to truth and penances. None amongst them ate singly any food that was good, and none had congress with other people's wives. As regards compassion, they behaved towards all creatures as towards their own selves. They never allowed the emission of the vital seed into empty space, into inferior animals, into forbidden wombs, or on sacred days. They were always distinguished for gifts, for cleverness, for simplicity, for hopeful exertion, for humility, for friendliness, and for forgiveness. And, O puissant one, truth, charity, penance, purity, compassion, soft speeches and absence of animosity towards friends,—all these were always in them. Slumber, procrastination, fretfulness, envy, and want of foresight, discontent, melancholy, cupidity never assailed them. In consequence of the _Danavas_ having been distinguished for these good qualities, I dwelt with them from the beginning of the creation for many _yugas_ together. Times were altered, and that alteration brought about an alteration in the character of the _Danavas_. I saw that virtue and morality deserted them and they began to own the sway of lust and wrath. Persons, though themselves inferior in attainments, began to cherish animosities towards seniors in age possessed of superior qualifications, and while the latter, possessed of virtue and merit, used to speak upon proper topics in the midst of assemblies, the former began to ridicule or laugh at them. When reverend seniors in age came, the younger individuals, seated at their ease, refused to adore the former by rising up and saluting them with respect. In the presence of sires, sons began to exercise power (in matters that concerned sires alone). They that were not in receipt of wages accepted service and shamelessly proclaimed the fact, Those <span id="p148"><sup><small>[ p. 148 ]</small></sup></span> amongst them that succeeded in amassing great wealth by doing unrighteous and censurable deeds came to be held in esteem. [^360] During the night they began to indulge in loud screams and shrieks. Their _homa_ fires ceased to send bright and upward flames. Sons began to lord it over sires, and wives dominated over husbands. Mothers, fathers, aged seniors, preceptors, guests, and guides ceased to command respect for their superior status. People ceased to bring up with affection their own offspring but began to desert them. Without giving away the defined portion in alms and reserving the fixed portion for offering it unto the gods, every one ate what he had. Indeed, without offering their goods to the deities in sacrifices and without sharing them with the _Pitris_, the gods, guests, and reverend seniors, they appropriated them to their own use shamelessly. Their cooks no longer professed any consideration for purity of mind, deed, and word. They ate what had been left uncovered. Their corn lay scattered in yards, exposed to devastation by crows and rats. Their milk remained exposed, and they began to touch clarified butter with hands unwashed after eating. [^361] Their spades, domestic knives, baskets, and dishes and cups of white brass, and other utensils began to lie scattered in their houses. Their housewives abstained from looking after these. They no longer attained to the repairs of their houses and walls. Tethering their animals they abstained from giving them food and drink. [^362] Disregarding children that only looked on, and without having fed their dependants, the _Danavas_ ate what they had. They began to prepare _payasa_ and _krisara_ and dishes of meat and cakes and _sashkuli_ (not for gods and guests) but for their own slaves, and commenced to eat the flesh of animals not killed in sacrifices. [^363] They used to sleep even after the sun had risen. They made night of their morns. Day and night disputes and quarrels waxed in every house of theirs. They that were not respectable amongst them no longer showed any respect for those that deserve respect while the latter were seated in any place. Fallen off from their defined duties, they ceased to reverence those that had betaken themselves to the woods for leading a life of peace and divine contemplation. Intermixture of castes freely commenced among them. They ceased to attend to purity of person or mind. Brahmanas learned in the Vedas ceased to command respect among them. Those again that were ignorant of _Richs_ were not condemned or punished. Both were treated on a footing of equality, those, that is, that deserved respect and those that deserved no respect. Their servant girls became wicked in behaviour, and began to wear necklaces of <span id="p149"><sup><small>[ p. 149 ]</small></sup></span> gold and other ornaments and fine robes, and used to remain in their houses or go away before their very eyes. They began to derive great pleasure from sports and diversions in which their women were dressed as men and their men as women. Those amongst their ancestors that were affluent had made gifts of wealth unto deserving persons. The descendants of the donors, even when in prosperous conditions, began to resume, for their unbelief, those gifts. When difficulties threatened the accomplishment of any purpose and friend sought the counsel of friend, that purpose was frustrated by the latter even if he had any interest of the slightest value to subserve by frustrating it. Amongst even their better classes have appeared traders and dealers in goods, intent upon taking the wealth of others. The Sudras amongst them have taken to the practice of penances. Some amongst them have begun to study, without making any rules for regulating their hours and food. Others have begun to study, making rules that are useless. Disciples have abstained from rendering obedience and service to preceptors. Preceptors again have come to treat disciples as friendly companions. Fathers and mothers are worn out with work, and have abstained from indulging in festivities. Parents in old age, divested of power over sons, have been forced to beg their food of the latter. Amongst them, even persons of wisdom, conversant with the Vedas, and resembling the ocean itself in gravity of deportment, have begun to betake themselves to agriculture and such other pursuits. Persons who are illiterate and ignorant have begun to be fed at _Sraddhas_. [^364] Every morning, disciples, instead of approaching preceptors for making dutiful enquiries for ascertaining what acts awaited accomplishment and for seeking commissions which they are to discharge, are themselves waited upon by preceptors who discharge those functions. Daughters-in-law, in the presence of their husbands' mothers and fathers, rebuke and chastise servants and maids, and summoning their husband's lecture and rebuke them. Sires, with great care, seek to keep sons in good humour, or dividing through fear their wealth among children, live in woe and affliction. [^365] Even persons enjoying the friendship of the victims, beholding the latter deprived of wealth in conflagrations or by robbers or by the king, have begun to indulge in laughter from feelings of mockery. They have become ungrateful and unbelieving and sinful and addicted to adulterous congress with even the spouses of their preceptors. They have betaken themselves to eating forbidden food. They have transgressed all bounds and restraints. They have become divested of that splendour which had distinguished them before. In consequence of these and other indications of wicked conduct and the reversal of their former nature, I shall not, O chief of the gods, dwell among them any longer. I have, therefore, come to thee of my own accord. Receive me with respect, O lord of Sachi! Honoured by thee, O chief of the celestials, I shall receive honour from all other deities. There, where <span id="p150"><sup><small>[ p. 150 ]</small></sup></span> I reside, the seven other goddesses with Jaya for their eighth, who love me, who are inseparably associated with me, and who depend upon me, desire to live. They are Hope, Faith, Intelligence, Contentment, Victory, Advancement, and Forgiveness. She who forms the eighth, _viz_., Jaya, occupies the foremost place amongst them, O chastiser of Paka. All of them and myself, having deserted the _Asuras_, have come to thy domains. We shall henceforth reside among the deities who are devoted to righteousness and faith.

“After the goddess had said so, the celestial _Rishi_ Narada, and Vasava, the slayer of Vritra, for gladdening her, offered her a joyful welcome. The god of wind,—that friend of Agni, then began to blow gently through heaven, bearing delicious odours, refreshing all creatures with whom he came into contact, and contributing to the felicity of every one of the senses. All the deities (hearing the news) assembled together in a pure and desirable spot and waited there in expectation of beholding Maghavat seated with Lakshmi beside him. Then the thousand-eyed chief of the gods, accompanied by Sree and his friend the great _Rishi_, and riding upon a splendid car drawn by green horses, came into that assembly of the celestials, receiving honour from all. Then the great _Rishi_ Narada, whose prowess was known to all the celestials, observing a sign that the wielder of the thunderbolt made and which Sree herself approved of, welcomed the advent of the goddess there and proclaimed it as exceedingly auspicious. Heaven's firmament became clear and bright and began to shower nectar upon the region of the self-born Grandsire. The celestial kettle-drums, though struck by none, began to beat, and all the points of the horizon, becoming clear, seemed ablaze with splendour. Indra began to pour rain upon crops that commenced to appear each at its proper season. No one then deviated from the path of righteousness. The earth became adorned with many mines filled with jewels and gems, and the chant of Vedic recitations and other melodious sounds swelled up on the occasion of that triumph of the celestials. Human beings, endued with firm minds, and all adhering to the auspicious path that is trod by the righteous, began to take pleasure in Vedic and other religious rites and acts. Men and gods and _Kinnaras_ and _Yakshas_ and _Rakshasas_ all became endued with prosperity and cheerfulness. Not a flower,—what need then be said of fruits,—dropped untimely from a tree even if the god of wind shook it with force. All the kine began to yield sweet milk whenever milked by men, and cruel and harsh words ceased to be uttered by any one. They who, from desire of advancement, approach before assemblies of Brahmanas, and read this narrative of the glorification of Sree by all the deities with Indra at their head, deities that are competent to grant every wish,—succeed in winning great prosperity. These then O chief of the Kurus, are the foremost indications of prosperity and adversity. Urged on by thee, I have told thee all. It behoves thee to bear thyself according to the instructions conveyed herein, understanding them after careful reflection!’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘By what disposition, what course of duties, what knowledge, and what energy, does one succeed in attaining to _Brahma_ which is immutable and which is beyond the reach of primordial nature.’ [^366]

“Bhishma said, ‘One that is engaged in the practice of the religion of _nivritti_, that eats abstemiously, and that has his senses under complete control, can attain to _Brahma_ which is immutable and which is above primordial nature. In this connection is cited the old narrative, O Bharata, of the discourse between Jaigishavya and Asita. Once on a time Asita-Devala addressed Jaigishavya who was possessed of great wisdom and fully acquainted with the truths of duty and morality.’

“Devala said, ‘Thou art not gladdened when praised. Thou dost not give way to wrath when blamed or censured. What, indeed, is thy wisdom? Whence hast thou got it? And what, indeed, is the refuge of that wisdom?’

“Bhishma said, ‘Thus questioned by Devala, the pure Jaigishavya of austere penances, said those words of high import, fraught with full faith and profound sense.’

“Jaigishavya said, ‘O foremost of _Rishis_, I shall tell thee of that which is the highest end, that which is the supreme goal, that which is tranquillity, in the estimation of all persons of righteous acts. They, O Devala, who behave uniformly towards those that praise them and those that blame them, they who conceal their own vows and good acts, they who never indulge in recriminations, they who never say even what is good when it is calculated to injure (instead of producing any benefit), they who do not desire to return injury for injury received, are said to be men possessed of wisdom. [^367] They never grieve for what is yet to come. They are concerned with only what is before them and acts as they should. They never indulge in sorrow for what is past or even call it to their minds. Possessed of power and regulated minds, they do at their pleasure, according to the way in which it should be done, what waits for them to do in respect of all objects, O Devala, if solicited regardfully thereto. [^368] Of mature knowledge, of great wisdom, with wrath under complete control, and with their passions kept under sway, they never do an injury to any one in thought, word, or deed. Destitute of envy, they never injure others, and possessed of self-control, they are never pained at the sight of other people's prosperity. Such men never indulge in exaggerated speeches, or set themselves in praising others, or in speaking ill of them. They are <span id="p152"><sup><small>[ p. 152 ]</small></sup></span> again never affected by praise and blame uttered by others in respect of them. They are tranquil in respect of all their desires, and are engaged in the good of all creatures. They never give way to wrath, or indulge in transports of joy, or injure any creature. Untying all the knots of their hearts, they pass on very happily. They have no friends nor are they the friends of others. They have no foes nor are they the foes of other creatures. Indeed, men that can live in this way can pass their days for ever in happiness. O best of regenerate ones, they who acquire a knowledge of the rules of morality and righteousness, and who observe those rules in practice, succeed in winning joy, while they who fall off from the path of righteousness are afflicted by anxieties and sorrow. I have now betaken myself to the path of righteousness. Decried by others, why shall I get annoyed with them, or praised by others, why shall I be pleased? Let men obtain whatsoever objects they please from whatsoever pursuits in which they engage themselves. (I am indifferent to acquisitions and losses). Praise and blame are unable to contribute to my advancement or the reverse. He that has understood the truths of things becomes gratified with even disregard as if it were ambrosia. The man of wisdom is truly annoyed with regard as if it were poison. He who is freed from all faults sleeps fearlessly both here and hereafter even if insulted by others. On the other hand, he who insults him, suffers destruction. Those men of wisdom who seek to attain to the highest end, succeed in obtaining it by observing conduct such as this. The man who has vanquished all his senses is regarded to have performed all the sacrifices. Such a person attains to the highest rung, _viz_., that of _Brahma_, which is eternal and which transcends the reach of primordial nature. The very gods, the _Gandharvas_, the _Pisachas_, and the _Rakshasas_, cannot reach the rung which is his who has attained to the highest end.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘What man is there who is dear to all, who gladdens all persons, and who is endued with every merit and every accomplishment?’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection I shall recite to thee the words that Kesava, asked by Ugrasena, said unto him on a former occasion.’

“Ugrasena said, ‘All persons seem to be very solicitous of speaking of the merits of Narada. I think that celestial _Rishi_, must really be possessed of every kind of merit. I ask thee, tell me this, O Kesava!’

“Vasudeva said, ‘O chief of the Kukkuras, listen to me as I mention in brief those good qualities of Narada with which I am acquainted, O king! Narada is as learned in the scriptures as he is good and pious in his conduct. And yet, on account of his conduct, he never cherishes pride that makes one's blood so hot. It is for this reason that he is worshipped everywhere. Discontent, wrath, levity, and fear, these do not exist in Narada. He is free <span id="p153"><sup><small>[ p. 153 ]</small></sup></span> from procrastination, and possessed of courage. For this he is worshipped everywhere. Narada deserves the respectful worship of all. He never falls back from his words through desire or cupidity. For this he is worshipped everywhere. He is fully conversant with the principles that lead to the knowledge of the soul, disposed to peace, possessed of great energy, and a master of his senses. He is free from guile, and truthful in speech. For this he is worshipped with respect everywhere. He is distinguished by energy, by fame, by intelligence, by knowledge, by humility, by birth, by penances, and by years. For these he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He is of good behaviour. He dresses and houses himself well. He eats pure food. He loves all. He is pure in body and mind. He is sweet-speeched. He is free from envy and malice. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He is certainly always employed in doing good to all people. No sin dwells in him. He never rejoices at other people's misfortunes. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He always seeks to conquer all earthly desires by listening to Vedic recitations and attending to the _Puranas_. He is a great renouncer and he never disregards any one. [^369] For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He casts an equal eye on all; and, therefore, he has no one whom he loves and none whom he hates. He always speaks what is agreeable to the hearer. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He is possessed of great learning in the scriptures. His conversation is varied and delightful. His knowledge and wisdom are great. He is free from cupidity. He is free also from deception. He is large-hearted. He has, conquered wrath and cupidity. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He has never quarrelled with any one for any subject connected with profit or pleasure. All faults have been torn away by him. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. His devotion (to _Brahma_) is firm. His soul is blameless. He is well-versed in the _Srutis_. He is free from cruelty. He is beyond the influence of delusion or faults. For this he is worshipped everywhere with respect. He is unattached to all such things as are objects of attachment (for others). For all that he seems to be attached to all things. [^370] He is never long subject to the influence of any doubt. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He has no yearning for objects connected with profit and pleasure. He never glorifies his own self. He is free from malice. He is mild in speech. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He observes the hearts, different from one another, of all men, without blaming any of them. He is well-versed in all matters <span id="p154"><sup><small>[ p. 154 ]</small></sup></span> connected with the origin of things. He never disregards or shows hatred for any kind of science. He lives according to his own standard of morality. He never suffers his time to pass away fruitlessly. His soul is under his control For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He has toiled in subjects that deserve the application of toil. He has earned knowledge and wisdom. He is never satiated with yoga. He is always attentive and ready for exertion. He is ever heedful. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He has never to feel shame for any deficiency of his. He is very attentive. He is always engaged by others in accomplishing what is for their good. He never divulges the secrets of others. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. He never yields to transports of joy on occasions of making even valuable acquisitions. He is never pained at losses. His understanding is firm and stable. His soul is unattached to all things. For this he is everywhere worshipped with respect. Who, indeed, is there that will not love him who is thus possessed of every merit and accomplishment, who is clever in all things, who is pure in body and mind, who is entirely auspicious, who is well-versed with the course of time and its opportuneness for particular acts, and who is well-acquainted with all agreeable things?'”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘I desire, O thou of Kuru's race, to know what the origin and what the end is of all creatures; what is the nature of their meditation and what are their acts; what are the divisions of time, and what the allotted periods of life in the respective epochs. I desire also to know in full the truth about the genesis and the conduct of the world; the origin of creatures into the world and the manner of their going on. Indeed, whence their creation and destruction? O best of virtuous persons, if thou art minded to favour us, do tell us this about which I ask thee. Having heard before this excellent discourse of Bhrigu unto the regenerate sage Bharadwaja which thou didst recite, my understanding, purged of ignorance, has become exceedingly attached to _yoga_, and withdrawn from worldly objects rests upon heavenly purity. I ask thee about the subject, therefore, once more. It behoves thee to discourse to me (more elaborately).’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection I shall recite to thee an old narrative of what the divine Vyasa said unto his son Suka when the latter had questioned the former. Having studied the illimitable Vedas with all their branches and the Upanishads, and desirous of leading a life of _Brahmacharya_ in consequence of his having earned excellence of religious merit, Suka addressed these very questions, about which his doubts had been solved, to his father the island-born _Rishi_ who had removed (by study and contemplation) all doubts connected with the topic of the true import of duties.’

<span id="p155"><sup><small>[ p. 155 ]</small></sup></span>

“Suka said, ‘It behoveth thee to tell me who the Creator is of all beings, as fixed by a knowledge of time, [^371] and what the duties are that should be accomplished by a Brahmana.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Unto his son who had questioned him, the sire, having a knowledge of both the past and future, conversant with all duties and endued with omniscience, thus discoursed on the subject.’

“Vyasa said, ‘Only _Brahma_, which is without beginning and without end, unborn, blazing with effulgence, above decay, immutable, indestructible, inconceivable, and transcending knowledge, exists before the Creation. [^372] The _Rishis_, measuring time, have named particular portions by particular names. Five and ten winks of the eye make what is called a _Kashtha_. Thirty _Kashthas_ would make what is called a _Kala_. Thirty _Kalas_, with the tenth part of a _Kala_ added, make what is known as a _Muhurta_. Thirty _Muhurtas_ make up one day and night. Thirty days and nights are called a month, and twelve months are called a year. Persons conversant with mathematical science say that a year is made up of two _ayanas_ (dependent on sun's motion), _viz_., the northern and the southern. The sun makes the day and the night for the world of man. The night is for the sleep of all living creatures, and the day is for the doing of action. A month of human beings is equal to a day and night of the _Pitris_. That division (as regards the _Pitris_) consists in this: the lighted fortnight (of men) is their day which is for the doing of acts; and the dark fortnight is their night for sleep. A year (of human beings) is equal to a day and night of the gods. The division (as regards the gods) consists in this: the half year for which the sun travels from the vernal to the autumnal equinox is the day of the deities, and the half year for which the sun travels from the latter to the former is their night. Computing by the days and nights of human beings about which I have told thee, I shall speak of the day and night of Brahman and his years also. I shall, in their order, tell thee the number of years, that are (thus) for different purposes computed differently in respect of the Krita, the Treta, the Dwapara, and the Kali _yugas_. Four thousand years (of the deities) is the duration of the first or Krita age. The morning of that epoch consists of four hundred years and its evening is of four hundred years. (The total duration, therefore, of the Krita _yuga_ is four thousand and eight hundred years of the deities). As regards the other _yugas_, the duration of each gradually decreases by a quarter in respect of both the substantive period with the conjoining portion and the conjoining portion itself. (Thus the duration of the Treta is three thousand years and its morning extends for three hundred years and its evening for three hundred). The duration of the Dwapara also is two thousand years, and its morning extends for two hundred years and its evening also for two hundred. The duration of the Kali _yuga_ is one thousand years, <span id="p156"><sup><small>[ p. 156 ]</small></sup></span> and its morning extends for one hundred years, and its evening for one hundred. [^373] These periods always sustain the never-ending and eternal worlds. They who are conversant with _Brahma_, O child, regard this as Immutable _Brahma_. In the Krita age all the duties exists in their entirety, along with Truth. No knowledge or object came to men of that age through unrighteous or forbidden means. [^374] In the other _yugas_, duty, ordained in the Vedas, is seen to gradually decline by a quarter in each. Sinfulness grows in consequence of theft, untruth, and deception. In the Krita age, all persons are free from disease and crowned with success in respect of all their objects, and all live for four hundred years. In the Treta, the period of life decreases by a quarter. It has also been heard by us that, in the succeeding _yugas_, the words of the Vedas, the periods of life, the blessings (uttered by Brahmanas), and the fruits of Vedic rites, all decrease gradually. The duties set down for the Krita _yuga_ are of one kind. Those for the Treta are otherwise. Those for the Dwapara are different. And those for the Kali are otherwise. This is in accordance with that decline that marks every succeeding _yuga_. In the Krita, Penance occupies the foremost place. In the Treta, Knowledge is foremost. In the Dwapara, Sacrifice has been said to be the foremost, In the Kali _yuga_, only Gift is the one thing that has been laid down. The learned say that these twelve thousand years (of the deities) constitute what is called a _yuga_. A thousand such _yugas_ compose a single day of Brahman. [^375] The same is the duration of Brahman's night. With the commencement of Brahman's day the universe begins to start into life. During the period of universal dissolution the Creator sleeps, having recourse to _yoga_\-meditation. When the period of slumber expires, He awakes. That then which is Brahman's day extends for a thousand such _yugas_. His nights also extends for a thousand similar _yugas_. They who know this are said to know the day and the night. On the expiry of His night, Brahman, waking up, modifies the indestructible _chit_ by causing it to be overlaid with Avidya. He then causes Consciousness to spring up, whence proceeds Mind which is identical with the Manifest.’” [^376]

“Vyasa said, '_Brahma_ is the effulgent seed from which, existing as it does by itself, hath sprung the whole universe consisting of two kinds of being, _viz_., the mobile and the immobile. [^377] At the dawn of His day, waking up. He creates with the help of Avidya this universe. At first springs up that which is called Mahat. That Mahat is speedily transformed into Mind which is the soul of the Manifest. [^378] Overwhelming the Chit, which is effulgent, with Avidya, Mind creates seven great beings. [^379] Urged by the desire of creating, Mind, which is far-reaching, which has many courses, and which has desire and doubt for its principal indications, begins to create diverse kinds of objects by modifications of itself. First springs from it Space. Know that its property is Sound. From Space, by modification, arises the bearer of all scents, _viz_., the pure and mighty Wind. It is said to possess the attribute of Touch. From Wind also, by modification, springs Light endued with effulgence. Displayed in beauty, and called also Sukram, it starts into existence, thus, possessing the attribute of Form. From Light, by modification, arises Water having Taste for its attribute. From Water springs Earth having Scent for its attribute. These are said to represent initial creation. [^380] These, one after another, acquire the attributes of the immediately preceding ones from which they have sprung. Each has not only its own special attribute but each succeeding one has the attributes of all the preceding ones. (Thus Space has only Sound for its attribute. After Space comes Wind, which has, therefore, both Sound and Touch for its attributes. From Wind comes Light or Fire, which has Sound, Touch, and Form for its attributes. From Light is Water, which has Sound, Touch, Form, and Taste for its attributes. From Water is Earth, which has Sound, Touch, Form, Taste, and Scent for its attributes). If anybody, perceiving Scent in Water, were from ignorance to say that it belongs to Water, he would fall into an error, for Scent is the attribute of Earth though it may exist in a state of attachment with Water and also Wind. These seven kinds of entities, possessing diverse kinds of energy, at first existed separately from one another. They could not create objects without all of them coming together into a state of commingling. All these great entities coming together, and commingling with one another, <span id="p158"><sup><small>[ p. 158 ]</small></sup></span> form the constituent parts of the body which are called limbs. [^381] In consequence of the combination of those limbs, the sum total, invested with form and having six and ten constituent parts, becomes what is called the body. (When the gross body is thus formed), the subtile Mahat, with the unexhausted residue of acts, then enters that combination called the gross body. [^382] Then the original Creator of all beings, having by his Maya divided Himself, enters that subtile form for surveying or overlooking everything. And inasmuch as he is the original Creator of all beings he is on that account called the Lord of all beings. [^383] It is he who creates all beings mobile and immobile. After having thus assumed the form of Brahman he creates the worlds of the gods, the _Rishis_, the _Pitris_, and men; the rivers, the seas, and the oceans, the points of the horizon, countries and provinces, hills and mountains, and large trees, human beings, _Kinnaras_, _Rakshasas_, birds, animals domestic and wild, and snakes. Indeed, he creates both kinds of existent things, _viz_., those that are mobile and those that are immobile; and those that are destructible and those that are indestructible. Of these created objects each obtains those attributes which it had during the previous Creation; and each, indeed, obtains repeatedly the same attributes at every subsequent Creation. Determined in respect of character by either injuriousness or peacefulness, mildness or fierceness, righteousness or unrighteousness, truthfulness or untruthfulness, each creature, at every new creation, obtains <span id="p159"><sup><small>[ p. 159 ]</small></sup></span> that particular attribute which it had cherished before. It is in consequence of this that that particular attribute attaches to it. It is the Ordainer himself who attaches variety to the great entities (of Space, Earth, etc.), to the objects of the senses (such as form, etc.), and to size or bulk of existent matter, and appoints the relations of creatures with those multiform entities. Amongst men who have devoted themselves to the science of things, there are some who say that, in the production of effects, exertion is supreme. Some learned persons say that Destiny is supreme, and some that it is Nature which is the agent. Others say that Acts flowing from (personal) exertion, and Destiny, produce effects, aided by Nature. Instead of regarding any of these as singly competent for the production of effects, they say that it is the union of all three that produces all effects. As regards this subject, [^384] some say that such is the case; some, that such is not the case; some, that both of these are not the case; and some, that it is not that the reverse of both are not. These, of course, are the contentions of those that depend on Acts, with reference to objects. They however, whose vision is directed to truth regard _Brahma_ as the cause. [^385] Penance is the highest good for living creatures. The roots of penance are tranquillity and self-restraint. By penance one obtains all things that one wishes for in one's mind. By penance one attains to that Being who creates the universe. He who (by penance) succeeds in attaining to that Being becomes the puissant master of all beings. It is by Penance that the _Rishis_ are enabled to read the Vedas ceaselessly. At the outset the Self-born caused those excellent Vedic sounds, that are embodiments of knowledge and that have neither beginning nor end to (spring up and) flow on (from preceptor to disciple). From those sounds have sprung all kinds of actions. The names of the _Rishis_, all things that have been created, the varieties of form seen in existent things, and the course of actions, have their origin in the Vedas. [^386] Indeed, the Supreme Master of all beings, in the beginning, created all things from the words of the Vedas. Truly, the names of the _Rishis_, and all else that has been created, occur in the Vedas. Upon the expiration of his night (_i.e._, at the dawn of his day), the uncreate Brahman creates, from prototypes that existed before, all things which are, of course, <span id="p160"><sup><small>[ p. 160 ]</small></sup></span> well-made by Him. [^387] In the Vedas hath been indicated the topic of the Soul's Emancipation, along with the ten means constituted by study of the Vedas, adoption of the domestic mode of life, penances, observance of duties common to all the modes of life, sacrifices, performance of all such acts as lead to pure fame, meditation which is of three kinds, and that kind of emancipation which is called success (_Siddhi_) attainable in this life. [^388] That incomprehensible Brahma which has been declared in the words of the Vedas, and which has been indicated more clearly in the Upanishads by those who have an insight into the Vedas, can be realised by gradually following the practices referred to above. [^389] Unto a person who thinks he has a body, this consciousness of duality, fraught again with that of pairs of opposites, is born only of acts in which he is engaged. (That consciousness of duality ceases during dreamless slumber or when Emancipation has been attained). That person, however, who has attained to Emancipation, aided by his knowledge, forcibly drives off that consciousness of duality. Two Brahmas should be known, _viz_., the Brahma represented by sound (_i.e._, the Vedas), and secondly that which is beyond the Vedas and is supreme. One that is conversant with _Brahma_ represented by sound succeeds in attaining to _Brahma_ that is Supreme. The slaughter of animals is the sacrifice laid down for the Kshatriyas. The growing of corn is the sacrifice laid down for the Vaisyas. Serving the three other orders is the sacrifice laid down for the Sudras. Penances (or worship of _Brahma_) is the sacrifice laid down for the Brahmanas. In the Krita age the performance of sacrifices was not necessary. Such performance became necessary in the Treta age. In the Dwapara, sacrifices have begun to fall off. In the Kali, the same is the case with them. In Krita age, men, worshipping only one Brahma, looked upon the _Richs_, the _Samans_, the _Yajuses_ and the rites and sacrifices that are performed from motives of advantage, as all different from the object of their worship, and practised only _Yoga_, by means of penances. In the Treta age, many mighty men appeared that swayed all mobile and immobile objects. (Though the generality of men in that age were not naturally inclined to the practice of righteousness, yet those great <span id="p161"><sup><small>[ p. 161 ]</small></sup></span> leaders forced them to such practice.) Accordingly, in that age, the Vedas, and sacrifices and the distinctions between the several orders, and the four modes of life, existed in a compact state. In consequence, however, of the decrease in the period of life in Dwapara, all these, in that age, fall off from that compact condition. In the Kali age, all the Vedas become so scarce that they may not be even seen by men. Afflicted by iniquity, they suffer extermination along with the rites and sacrifices laid down in them. The righteousness which is seen in the Krita age is now visible in such Brahmanas as are of cleansed souls and as are devoted to penances and the study of the scriptures. As regards the other _yugas_, it is seen that without at once giving up the duties and acts that are consistent with righteousness, men, observant of the practices of their respective orders, and conversant with the ordinance of the Vedas are led by the authority of the scriptures, to betake themselves from motives of advantage and interest to sacrifices and vows and pilgrimages to sacred waters and spots. [^390] As in the season of rains a large variety of new objects of the immobile order are caused to come forth into life by the showers that fall from the clouds, even so many new kinds of duty or religious observances are brought about in each _yuga_. As the same phenomena reappear with the reappearance of the seasons, even so, at each new Creation the same attributes appear in each new Brahman and Hara. I have, before this, spoken to thee of Time which is without beginning and without end, and which ordains this variety in the universe. It is that Time which creates and swallows up all creatures. All the innumerable creatures that exist subject to pairs of opposites and according to their respective natures, have Time for their refuge. It is Time that assumes those shapes and it is Time that upholds them. [^391] I have thus discoursed to thee, O son, on the topics about which thou hadst inquired, _viz_., Creation, Time, Sacrifices and other rites, the Vedas, the real actor in the universe, action, and the consequences of action.'"

## SECTION CCXXXIII

“Vyasa said, ‘I shall now tell thee, how, when his day is gone and his night <span id="p162"><sup><small>[ p. 162 ]</small></sup></span> comes, he withdraws all things unto himself, or how the Supreme Lord, making this gross universe exceedingly subtile, merges everything into his Soul. When the time comes for universal dissolution, a dozen Suns, and Agni with his seven flames, begin to burn. The whole universe, wrapt by those flames, begins to blaze forth in a vast conflagration. All things mobile and immobile that are on the earth first disappear and merge into the substance of which this planet is composed. After all mobile and immobile objects have thus disappeared, the earth, shorn of trees and herbs, looks naked like a tortoise shell. Then water takes up the attribute of earth, _viz_., scent. When earth becomes shorn of its principal attribute, that element is on the eve of dissolution. Water then prevails. Surging into mighty billows and producing awful roars, only water fills this space and moves about or remains still. Then the attribute of water is taken by Heat, and losing its own attribute, water finds rest in that element. Dazzling flames of fire, ablaze all around, conceal the Sun that is in the centre of space. Indeed, then, space itself, full of those fiery flames, burns in a vast conflagration. Then Wind comes and takes the attribute, _viz_., form of Heat or Light, which thereupon becomes extinguished, yielding to Wind, which, possessed of great might, begins to be awfully agitated. The Wind, obtaining its own attribute, _viz_., sound, begins to traverse upwards and downwards and transversely along all the ten points. Then Space takes the attribute, _viz_., sound of Wind, upon which the latter becomes extinguished and enters into a phase of existence resembling that of unheard or unuttered sound. Then Space is all that remains, that element whose attribute, _viz_., sound dwells in all the other elements, divested of the attributes of form, and taste, and touch, and scent, and without shape of any kind, like sound in its unmanifest state of existence. Then sound, which is the attribute of space, is swallowed up by Mind which is the essence of all things that are manifest. Thus Mind which in itself is unmanifest withdraws all that is manifested by Mind. This withdrawal of Mind as displayed into Mind as undisplayed or subtile, is called the destruction of the vast external universe. [^392] Then Chandrama's having made Mind (thus) withdraw its attribute into itself, swallows it up. When Mind, ceasing to exist, thus enters into Chandramas, the other attributes that are owned by Iswara are all that remain. This Chandramas, which is called also _Sankalpa_, is then, after a very long time, brought under Iswara's sway, then reason being that that Sankalpa has to perform a very difficult act, _viz_., the destruction of Chitta or the faculties that are employed in the process called judgment. When this has been effected, the condition reached is said to be of high Knowledge. <span id="p163"><sup><small>[ p. 163 ]</small></sup></span> Then Time swallows up this Knowledge, and as the _Sruti_ declares, Time itself, in its turn, is swallowed up by Might, or Energy. Might or energy, however, is (again) swallowed up by Time, which last is then brought under her sway by Vidya. Possessed of Vidya, Iswara then swallows up non-existence itself into his Soul. That is Unmanifest and Supreme _Brahma_. That is Eternal, and that is the Highest of the High. Thus all existent creatures are withdrawn into _Brahma_. Truly hath this, which should be conceived (with the aid of the scriptures) and which is a topic of Science, been thus declared by Yogins possessed of Supreme Souls, after actual experience. Even thus doth the Unmanifest _Brahma_ repeatedly undergo the processes of Elaboration and Withdrawal (_i.e._, Creation and Destruction), and even thus Brahman's Day and Night each consist of a thousand _yugas_.’” [^393]


## SECTION CCXXXIV

“Vyasa said, ‘Thou hadst asked me about the Creation of all beings; I have now narrated that to thee in full. Listen to me as I tell thee now what the duties are of a Brahmana. The rituals of all ceremonies for which sacrificial fees are enjoined, commencing with _Jatakarma_ and ending with _Samavartana_, depend for their performance upon a preceptor competent in the Vedas. [^394] Having studied all the Vedas and having displayed a submissive behaviour towards his preceptor during his residence with him, and having paid the preceptor's fee, the youth should return home with a thorough knowledge of all sacrifices. [^395] Receiving the permission of his preceptor, he should adopt <span id="p164"><sup><small>[ p. 164 ]</small></sup></span> one of the four modes of life and live in it in due observance of its duties till he casts off his body. He should either lead a life of domesticity with spouses and engaged in creating offspring, or live in the observance of _Brahmacharya_; or in the forest in the company of his preceptor, or in the practice of the duties laid down for a _yati_. A life of domesticity is said to be the root of all the other modes of life. A self-restrained householder who has conquered all his attachments to worldly objects always attains to success (in respect of the great object of life). A Brahmana, by begetting children, by acquiring a knowledge of the Vedas, and by performing sacrifices, pays off the three debts he owes. [^396] He should then enter the other modes of life, having cleansed himself by his acts. He should settle in that place which he may ascertain to be the most sacred spot on earth, and he should strive in all matters that lead to fame, for attaining to a position of eminence. The fame of Brahmanas increases through penances that are very austere, through mastery of the various branches of knowledge, through sacrifices, and through gifts. Indeed, a person enjoys endless regions of the righteous (in the next world) as long as his deeds or the memory thereof lasts in this world. A Brahmana should teach, study, officiate at other people's sacrifices, and offer sacrifices himself. He should not give away in vain or accept other people's gifts in vain. Wealth, sufficient in quantity, that may come from one who is assisted in a sacrifice, from a pupil, or from kinsmen (by marriage) of a daughter, should be spent in the performance of sacrifice or in making gifts. Wealth coming from any of these sources should never be enjoyed by a Brahmana singly. [^397] For a Brahmana leading a life of domesticity there is no means save the acceptance of gifts for the sake of the deities, or _Rishis_, or _Pitris_, or preceptor or the aged, or the diseased, or the hungry. [^398] Unto those that are persecuted by unseen foes, or those that are striving to the best of their power to acquire knowledge, one should make gifts from one's own possessions, including even cooked food, more than one can fairly afford. [^399] Unto a deserving person there is nothing that cannot be given. They that are good and wise deserve to have even the prince of steeds, called Uchchaisravas, belonging to Indra himself. [^400] Of high vows (king) Satyasandha, having, with due humility, offered his own life-breaths for saving those of a Brahmana, ascended to heaven. Sankriti's son Rantideva, having given only lukewarm water to the high-souled Vasishtha, ascended to heaven and received high honours there. <span id="p165"><sup><small>[ p. 165 ]</small></sup></span> Atri's royal son Indradamana, possessed of great intelligence, having given diverse kinds of wealth to a deserving person, acquired diverse regions of felicity in the next world. Usinara's son Sivi, having given away his own limbs and the dear son of loins for the sake of a Brahmana, ascended to heaven from this world. Pratardana, the ruler of Kasi, having given away his very eyes to a Brahmana, obtained great fame both here and hereafter. King Devavridha, having given away a very beautiful and costly umbrella, with eight golden ribs, proceeded to heaven with all the people of his kingdom. Sankriti of Atri's race, possessed of great energy, having given instruction to his disciples on the subject of Impersonal _Brahma_, proceeded to regions of great felicity. Amvarisha of great prowess, heaving given unto the Brahmanas eleven _Arvudas_ of kine, proceeded to heaven with all the people of his kingdom. Savitri, by giving away her ear-rings, and king Janamejaya, by giving away his own body, both proceeded to high regions of felicity. Yuvanaswa, the son of Vrishadarbha, by giving away diverse kinds of gems, a fine mansion, and many beautiful women, ascended to heaven. Nimi, the ruler of the Videhas, gave away his kingdom, Jamadagni's son (Rama) gave away the whole earth; and Gaya gave away the earth with all her towns and cities, unto the Brahmanas. Once when the clouds ceased to pour, Vasishtha, resembling Brahman himself, kept alive all creatures like Prajapati keeping them alive (by his energy and kindness). Karandhama's son Marutta of cleansed soul, by giving away his daughter to Angiras, speedily ascended to heaven. Brahmadatta, the ruler of the Panchalas, possessed of superior intelligence, by giving away two precious jewels called _Nidhi_ and _Sankha_ unto some of the foremost of the Brahmanas, obtained many regions of felicity. King Mitrasaha, having given his own dear wife Madayanti unto the high-souled Vasishtha, ascended to heaven with that wife of his. The royal sage Sahasrajit, possessed of great fame having cast off dear life itself for the sake of a Brahmana, ascended to regions of great felicity. King Satadyumna, having given to Mudgala a mansion made of gold and full of every object of comfort and use, ascended to heaven. The king of the Salwas, known by the name of Dyutimat, possessed of great prowess, gave unto Richika his entire kingdom and ascended to heaven. The Royal sage Madiraswa, by giving away his daughter of slender waist to Hiranyahasta, ascended to such regions as are held in esteem by the very gods. The royal sage Lomapada, of great prowess, by giving away his daughter Santa to Rishyasringa, obtained the fruition of all his wishes. King Prasenajit, of great energy, by giving away a hundred thousand kine with calves, ascended to excellent regions of felicity. These and many others, possessed of great and well-ordered souls and having their senses under control, ascended, by means Of gifts and penances, to heaven. Their fame will last as long as the earth herself will last. All of them have, by gifts, sacrifices and procreation of issue, proceeded to heaven.’”

“Vyasa said, ‘The knowledge called _Trayi_ which occurs in the Vedas and their branches should be acquired. That knowledge is to be derived from the Richs, the Samans, and the sciences called _Varna_ and _Akshara_. There are besides, the Yajuses and the Atharvans. In the six kinds of acts indicated in these, dwells the Divine Being. They that are well-versed in the declarations of the Vedas, that have knowledge of the Soul, that are attached to the quality of Goodness, and that are highly blessed, succeed in understanding the origin and the end of all things. A Brahmana should live in the observance of the duties laid down in the Vedas. He should do all his acts like a good man of restrained soul. He should earn his livelihood without injuring any creature. Having derived knowledge from the good and wise, he should control his passions and propensities. Well-versed in the scriptures, he should practise those duties that have been laid down for him, and do all acts in this world guided by the quality of goodness. Leading even the domestic mode of life., the Brahmana should be observant of the six acts already spoken of. [^401] His heart full of faith, he should worship the deities in the five well-known sacrifices. Endued with patience, never heedless, having self-control, conversant with duties, with a cleansed soul, divested of joy, pride, and wrath, the Brahmana should never sink in languor. Gifts, study of the Vedas, sacrifices, penances, modesty, guilelessness, and self-restraint,—these enhance one's energy and destroy one's sins. One endued with intelligence should be abstemious in diet and should conquer one's senses. Indeed, having subdued both lust and wrath, and having washed away all his sins, he should strive for attaining to _Brahma_. He should worship the Fire and Brahmanas, and bow to the deities. He should avoid all kinds of inauspicious discourse and all acts of unrighteous injury. This preliminary course of conduct is first laid down for a Brahmana. Subsequently, when knowledge comes, he should engage himself in acts, for in acts lies success. [^402] The Brahmana who is endued with intelligence succeeds in crossing the stream of life that is so difficult to cross and that is so furious and terrible, that has the five senses for its waters that has cupidity for its source, and wrath for its mire. He should never shut his eyes to the fact that Time stands behind him in a threatening attitude.—Time who is the great stupefier of all things, and who is armed with very great and irresistible force, issuing from the great Ordainer himself. Generated by the current of Nature, the universe is being ceaselessly carried along. The mighty river of Time, overspread with eddies constituted by the years, having the months for its waves and the seasons for its current, the fortnights for its floating straw and grass, and the rise and fall of the eyelids for its froth, the days and the nights for its water, and desire and lust for its terrible crocodiles, the Vedas and sacrifices for its rafts, and <span id="p167"><sup><small>[ p. 167 ]</small></sup></span> the righteousness of creatures for its islands, and Profit and Pleasure for its springs, truthfulness of speech and Emancipation for its shores, benevolence for the trees that float along it, and the _yugas_ for the lakes along its course,—the mighty river of Time,—which has an origin as inconceivable as that of _Brahma_ itself, is ceaselessly bearing away all beings created by the great Ordainer towards the abode of Yama. [^403] Persons possessed of wisdom and patience always succeed in crossing this awful river by employing the rafts of knowledge and wisdom. What, however, can senseless fools, destitute of similar rafts do (when thrown into that furious stream)? That only the man of wisdom succeeds in crossing this stream and not he that is unwise, is consistent with reason. The former beholds from a distance the merits and faults of everything. (Accordingly, he succeeds in adopting or rejecting what is deserving of adoption or rejection). The man, however, of unstable and little understanding, and whose soul is full of desire and cupidity, is always filled with doubt. Hence the man destitute of wisdom never succeeds in crossing that river. He also who sits inactively (in doubt) can never pass it over. The man destitute of the raft of wisdom, in consequence of his having to bear the heavy weight of great faults, sinks down. One that is seized by the crocodile of desire, even if possessed of knowledge, can never make knowledge one's raft. [^404] For these reasons, the man of wisdom and intelligence should strive to float over the stream of Time (without sinking in it). He indeed, succeeds in keeping himself afloat who becomes conversant with _Brahma_. One born in a noble race, abstaining from the three duties of teaching, officiating at other's sacrifices and accepting gifts, and doing only the three other acts, _viz_., studying, sacrificing, and giving, should, for those reasons, strive to float over the stream. Such a man is sure to cross it aided by the raft of wisdom. One who is pure in conduct, who is self-restrained and observant of good vows, whose soul is under control, and who is possessed of wisdom, certainly wins success in this and the other world. The Brahmana leading a domestic mode of life should conquer wrath and envy, practise the virtues already named, and worshipping the deities in the five sacrifices, eat after having fed the deities, _Pitris_, and guests. He should conform to those duties which are observed by the good; he should do all his acts like a person of governed soul; and he should, without injuring any creature, draw his substance by adopting a course that is not censurable. One who is well-versed <span id="p168"><sup><small>[ p. 168 ]</small></sup></span> in the truths of the Vedas and the other branches of knowledge, whose behaviour is like that of a person of well-governed soul, who is endued with a clear vision, who observes those duties that are laid down for his order, who does not, by his acts, produce an inter-mixture of duties, who attends to the observances set down in the scriptures, who is full of faith, who is self-restrained, who is possessed of wisdom, who is destitute of envy and malice, and who is well-conversant with the distinctions between righteousness and inequity, succeeds in crossing all his difficulties. That Brahmana who is possessed of fortitude, who is always heedful, who is self-restrained, who is conversant with righteousness, whose soul is under control, and who has transcended joy, pride, and wrath, has never to languish in grief. This is the course of conduct that was ordained of old for a Brahmana. He should strive for the acquisition of Knowledge, and do all the scriptural acts. By living thus, he is sure to obtain success. One who is not possessed of clear vision does wrong even when one wishes to do right. Such a person, by even exercising his judgment, does such acts of virtue as partake of the nature of inequity. Desiring to do what is right, one does what is wrong. Similarly, desiring to do what is wrong one does what is right. Such a person is a fool. Not knowing, the two kinds of acts, one has to undergo repeated rebirths and deaths.’”

“Vyasa said, ‘If Emancipation be desirable, then knowledge should be acquired. For a person who is borne now up and now down along the stream of Time or life, knowledge is the raft by which he can reach the shore. Those wise men who have arrived at certain conclusions (regarding the character of the soul and that which is called life) by the aid of wisdom, are able to assist the ignorant in crossing the stream of time or life with the raft of knowledge. They, however, that are ignorant, are unable save either themselves or others. He who has freed himself from desire and all other faults, and who has emancipated himself from all attachments, should attend to, these two and ten requirements of yoga, _viz_., place, acts, affection, objects, means, destruction, certainty, eyes, food, suppression, mind and survey. [^405] <span id="p169"><sup><small>[ p. 169 ]</small></sup></span> He who wishes to obtain superior Knowledge, should, by the aid of his understanding, restrain both speech and mind. He who wishes to have tranquillity, should, by the aid of his knowledge, restrain his soul. Whether he becomes compassionate or cruel, whether he becomes conversant with all the Vedas or ignorant of the _Richs_, whether he becomes righteous and observant of sacrifices or the worst of sinners, whether he becomes eminent for prowess and wealth or plunged into misery, that person who directs his mind towards these (attributes that I have spoken of), is sure to cross the ocean of life which is so difficult to cross. Without speaking of the results of the attainment of _Brahma_ by yoga, it may be said that he who sets himself to only enquiring after the Soul transcends the necessity of observing the acts laid down in the Vedas. The body with _jiva_ within it is an excellent car. When sacrifices and religious rites are made its _upastha_, shame its _varutha_, Upaya and Apaya its _kuvara_, the breath called Apana its _aksha_, the breath called Prana its _yuga_, knowledge and the allotted period of existence its points for tying the steeds, heedfulness its handsome _vandhura_, the assumption of good behaviour its _nemi_, vision, touch, scent, and hearing its four steeds, wisdom its _nabhi_, all the scriptures its _pratoda_, certain knowledge of the scriptural declarations its driver, the soul its firmly-seated rider, faith and self-restraint its fore-runners, renunciation its inseparable companion following behind and bent upon doing it good, purity the path along which it goes, meditation (or union with _Brahma_) its goal, then may that car reach _Brahma_ and shine there in effulgence. [^406] I shall now tell thee the speedy means that should be adopted by the person who would equip his car in such a fashion for passing through this wilderness of the world in order to reach the goal <span id="p170"><sup><small>[ p. 170 ]</small></sup></span> constituted by Brahma that is above decrepitude and destruction. To set the mind upon one thing at a time is called _Dharana_. [^407] The Yogin observing proper vows and restraints, practises in all seven kinds of _Dharana_. There are, again, as many kinds of _Dharanas_ arising out of these, upon subjects that are near or remote. [^408] Through these the Yogin gradually acquires mastery over Earth, Wind, Space, Water, Fire, Consciousness, and Understanding. After this he gradually acquires mastery over the Unmanifest. [^409] I shall now describe to thee the conceptions in their order that are realised by particular individuals amongst those that are engaged in _yoga_ according to the rules and ordinances that have been laid down. I shall tell thee also of the nature of the success that attaches to _yoga_ commenced (according to rules) by him who looks within his own self. [^410] The Yogin, that abandons his gross body, following the instructions of his preceptor, beholds his soul displaying the following forms in consequence of its subtility. To him in the first stage, the welkin seems to be filled with a subtile substance like foggy vapour. [^411] Of the Soul which has been freed from the body, even such becomes the form. When this fog disappears, a second (or new) form becomes visible. For, then, the Yogin beholds within himself, in the firmament of his heart, the form of Water. After the disappearance of water, the form of Fire displays itself. When this disappears, the form that becomes perceivable is that of Wind as effulgent as a well-tempered weapon of high polish. Gradually, the form displayed by Wind becomes like that of the thinnest gossamer. Then having acquired whiteness, and also, the subtlety of air, the Brahman's soul is said to attain the supreme whiteness and subtlety of Ether. Listen to me as I tell thee the consequences of these diverse conditions when they occur. That Yogin who has been able to achieve the conquest of the earth-element, attains by such lordship to the power of Creation. Like a second Prajapati endued with a nature that is perfectly imperturbable, he can from his own <span id="p171"><sup><small>[ p. 171 ]</small></sup></span> body create all kinds of creatures. With only his toe, or with his hand or feet, that person can singly cause the whole Earth to tremble who has achieved the lordship of the Wind. Even this is the attribute of the Wind as declared in the _Sruti_. The Yogin, who has achieved the lordship of Space, can exist brightly in Space in consequence of his having attained to uniformity with that element, and can also disappear at will. By lordship over Water, one can (like Agastya) drink up rivers, lakes, and oceans. By lordship over Fire, the Yogin becomes so effulgent that his form cannot be looked at. He becomes visible only when he extinguishes his consciousness of individuality,—these five elements come within his sway. When the Understanding, which is the soul of the five elements and of the consciousness of individuality, [^412] is conquered the Yogin attains to Omnipotence, and perfect Knowledge (or perception freed from doubt and uncertainty with respect to all things), comes to him. In consequence of this, the Manifest becomes merged into the Unmanifest or Supreme Soul from which the world emanates and becomes what is called Manifest. [^413] Listen now to me in detail as I expound the science of the Unmanifest. But first of all listen to me about all that is Manifest as expounded in the Sankhya system of philosophy. In both the Yoga and the Sankhya, systems, five and twenty topics of knowledge have been treated in nearly the same way. Listen to me as I mention their chief features. That has been said to be Manifest which is possessed of these four attributes, _viz_., birth, growth, decay, and death. That which is not possessed of these attributes is said to be Unmanifest. Two souls are mentioned in the Vedas and the sciences that are based upon them. The first (which is called Jivatman) is endued with the four attributes already mentioned, and has a longing for the four objects or purposes (_viz_., Religion, Wealth, Pleasure and Emancipation). This soul is called Manifest, and it is born of the Unmanifest (Supreme Soul). It is both Intelligent and non-Intelligent. I have thus told thee about _Sattwa_ (inert matter) and _Kshetrajna_ (immaterial spirit). Both kinds of Soul, it is said in the Vedas, become attached to objects of the senses. The doctrine of the Sankhyas is that one should keep oneself aloof or dissociated from objects of the senses. That Yogin who is freed from attachment and pride, who transcends all pairs of opposites, such as pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc., who never gives way to wrath or hate, who never speaks an untruth, who, though slandered or struck, still shows friendship for the slanderer or the striker, who never thinks of doing ill to others, who restrains the three, _viz_., speech, acts, and mind, and who behaves uniformly towards all creatures, succeeds in approaching the presence of Brahman. That person who cherishes no desire for earthly objects, who is not unwilling to take what comes, who is dependent on earthly objects to only that extent which is necessary for <span id="p172"><sup><small>[ p. 172 ]</small></sup></span> sustaining life, who is free from cupidity, who has driven off all grief, who has restrained his senses, who goes through all necessary acts, who is regardless of personal appearance and attire, whose senses are all collected (for devotion to the true objects of life), whose purposes are never left, unaccomplished, [^414] who bears himself with equal friendliness towards all creatures, who regards a clod of earth and a lump of gold with an equal eye, who is equally disposed towards friend and foe, who is possessed of patience, who takes praise and blame equally, [^415] who is free from longing with respect to all objects of desire, who practises Brahmacharya, and who is firm and steady in all his vows and observances, who has no malice or envy for any creature in the universe, is a Yogin who according to the Sankhya system succeeds in winning Emancipation. Listen now to the way and the means by which a person may win Emancipation through Yoga (or the system of Patanjali). That person who moves and acts after having transcended the puissance that the practice of Yoga brings about (in the initial stages), succeeds in winning Emancipation. [^416] I have thus discoursed to thee on those topics (_viz_., Emancipation according to the Sankhya system and that according to the Yoga system) which are dissimilar if the speaker be disposed to treat them as such (but which in reality, are one and the same). [^417] Thus can one transcend all pairs of opposites. Thus can one attain to Brahma.’” [^418]

## SECTION CCXXXVII

“Vyasa said, ‘Borne up and down in life's ocean, he that is capable of meditation seizes the raft of Knowledge and for achieving his Emancipation adheres to Knowledge itself (without extending his arms hither and thither for catching any other support).’ [^419]

<span id="p173"><sup><small>[ p. 173 ]</small></sup></span>

“Suka said, ‘What is that Knowledge? Is it that learning by which, when error is dispelled, the truth becomes discovered? Or, is it that course of duties consisting of acts to be done or achieved, by the aid of which the object sought may be understood or attained? Or, is it that course of duties, called abstention from acts, by which an extension of the Soul is to be sought? Do tell me what it is, so that by its aid, the two, _viz_., birth and death, may be avoided.’ [^420]

“Vyasa said, ‘That fool who believing that all this exists in consequence of its own nature without, in fact, an existent refuge or foundation, fills by such instruction the aspirations of disciples, dispelling by his dialectical ingenuity the reasons the latter might urge to the contrary, succeeds not in attaining to any truth. [^421] They again who firmly believe that all Cause is due to the nature of things, fail to acquire any truth by even listening to (wiser) men or the _Rishis_ (who are capable of instructing them). [^422] Those men of little intelligence who stop (in their speculations), having adopted either of these doctrines, indeed, those men who regard nature as the cause, never succeed in obtaining any benefit for themselves. [^423] This belief in Nature (as the producing and the sustaining Cause), arising as it does from a mind acting under the influence of error, brings about the destruction of the person who cherishes it. Listen now to the truth with respect to these two doctrines that maintain (1) that things exist by their own nature and (2) that they flow (in consequence of their own nature) from others that are different from and that precede them. [^424] Wise men apply themselves to agriculture and tillage, and the acquisition of crops (by those means) and of vehicles (for locomotion) and seats and carpets and houses. They attend also to the laying of pleasure-gardens, the construction of commodious mansions, and the preparation of <span id="p174"><sup><small>[ p. 174 ]</small></sup></span> medicines, for diseases of every kind. It is wisdom (which consists in the application of means) that leads to the fruition of purposes. It is wisdom that wins beneficial results. It is wisdom that enables kings to exercise and enjoy sovereignty although they are possessed of attributes equal to those of persons over whom they rule. [^425] It is by wisdom that the high and the low among beings are distinguished. It is by wisdom that the superior and the inferior ones among created objects are understood. It is wisdom or knowledge that is the highest refuge of all things. [^426] All the diverse kinds of created things have four kinds of birth. They are viviparous, oviparous, vegetables, and those born of filth. Creatures, again, that are mobile should be known to be superior to those that are immobile. It is consistent with reason that intelligent energy, inasmuch as it differentiates (all non-intelligent matter), should be regarded as superior to.(non-intelligent) matter. [^427] Mobile creatures, that are innumerable, and of two kinds, _viz_., those that have many legs and those that have two. The latter, however, are superior to the former. Bipeds, again are of two species, _viz_., those that live on land and those that are otherwise. Of these, the former are superior to the latter. The superior ones eat diverse kinds of cooked food. [^428] Bipeds moving on land are of two kinds _viz_., middling or intermediate, and those that are foremost. Of these, the middling or intermediate are regarded as superior (to the former) in consequence of their observance of the duties of caste. [^429] The middling or intermediate ones are said to be of two kinds, _viz_., those that are conversant with duties, and those that are otherwise. Of those, the former are superior in consequence of their discrimination in respect of what should be done and what should not. Those conversant with duties are said to be of two kinds, _viz_., those <span id="p175"><sup><small>[ p. 175 ]</small></sup></span> that are acquainted with the Vedas and those that are otherwise. Of these the former are superior, for the Vedas are said to dwell in them. [^430] Those that are acquainted with the Vedas are said to be of two kinds, _viz_., those that lecture on the Vedas and those that are otherwise. Of these, the former, who are fully conversant with the Vedas, with the duties and the rites laid down in them, and the fruits of those duties and rites, are superior in consequence of their publishing all those duties and rites. Indeed, all the Vedas with the duties laid down in them are said to flow from them. Preceptors of the Vedas are of two kinds, _viz_., those that are conversant with the Soul and those that are otherwise. Of these, the former are superior in consequence of their knowledge of what is meant by Birth and Death. [^431] As regards duties, they are, again, of two kinds (_viz_., Pravritti and Nivritti). He who is conversant with duties is said to be omniscient or possessed of universal knowledge. Such a man is a Renouncer. Such a man is firm in the accomplishment of his purposes. Such a man is truthful, pure (both outwardly and inwardly), and possessed of puissance. [^432] The gods know him for a Brahmana who is devoted to knowledge of Brahma (and not him who is conversant with only the duties of Pravritti). Such a man is versed also in the Vedas and earnestly devoted to the study of the Soul. [^433] They that have true knowledge behold their own Soul as existing both in and out. Such men, O child, are truly regenerate and such men are gods. [^434] Upon these rests this world of Beings, in them dwell this whole universe. There is nothing that is equal to their greatness. Transcending birth and death and distinctions and acts of every kind, they are the lords of the four kinds of creatures and are the equals of the Self-born himself.’” [^435]

<span id="p176"><sup><small>[ p. 176 ]</small></sup></span>

## SECTION CCXXXVIII

“Vyasa said, ‘These, then, are the obligatory acts ordained for Brahmanas. One possessed of knowledge always attains to success by going through (the prescribed) acts. If no doubt arises in respect of acts, then acts done are sure to lead to success. The doubt to which we refer is this: whether acts are obligatory or whether they are optional. [^436] As regards this (doubt about the true character of acts, it should be said that), if acts are ordained for man for inducing knowledge (by which alone Brahma or Emancipation is to be attained, even then) they should be regarded as obligatory (and not optional). I shall now discourse on them by the light of inferences and experience. Listen to me. [^437] With respect to acts some men say that Exertion is their cause. Others say that Necessity is their cause. Others, again, maintain that Nature is the cause. Some say that acts are the result of both Exertion and Necessity. Some maintain that acts flow from Time, Exertion, and Nature. Some say that of the three (_viz_., Exertion, Necessity, and Nature), one only (and not the other two) is the cause. Some are of opinion that all the three combined are the cause. [^438] Some persons that are engaged in the performance of acts say, with respect to all objects, that they exist, that they do not exist, that they cannot be said to exist, that they cannot be said not to exist, that it is not that they cannot be said to exist, and lastly, that it is not that they cannot be said not to exist. (These then are the diverse views entertained by men). They, however, that are Yogins, behold Brahma to be the universal cause. The men of the Treta, the Dwapara, and the Kali Yugas are inspired with doubts. The men, however, of the Krita Yuga are devoted to penances, possessed of tranquil souls, and observant of righteousness. [^439] In that age all men regard the Richs, the Samans, and the Yajuses as identical not withstanding their apparent diversity. Analysing desire and aversion, they worship only <span id="p177"><sup><small>[ p. 177 ]</small></sup></span> penance. [^440] Devoted to the practice of penances, steadfast in them, and rigid in their observance, one obtains the fruition of all desires by penances alone. By penance one attains to that by becoming which one creates the universe. By penance one becomes that in consequence of which one becomes the puissant master of all things. [^441] That Brahma has been expounded in the declarations of the Vedas. For all that, Brahma is inconceivable by even those that are conversant with those declarations. Once more has Brahma been declared in the Vedanta. Brahma, however, cannot be beheld by means of acts. [^442] The sacrifice ordained for Brahmans consists in japa (meditation and recitation), that for Kshatriyas consists in the slaughter of (clean) animals for the gratification of the deities; that for Vaisyas consists in the production of crops and, the keep of domestic animals; and that for Sudras in menial service of the: three other orders. By observing the duties laid down for him and by studying the Vedas and other scriptures, one becomes a _Dwija_ (regenerate). Whether one does any other act or not, one becomes a Brahmana by becoming the friend of all creatures. [^443] In the beginning of Treta, the Vedas and sacrifices and the divisions of caste and the several modes of life existed in, their entirety. In consequence, however, of the duration of life being decreased in Dwapara, those are overtaken by decline. In the Dwapara age as also in the Kali, the Vedas are overtaken by perplexity. Towards the close of Kali again, it is doubtful if they ever become even visible to the eye. [^444] In that age, the duties of the respective order disappear, and men become afflicted by iniquity. The juicy attributes of kine, of the earth, of water, and (medicinal and edible) herbs, disappear. [^445] Through (universal) iniquity the Vedas disappear and with them all the duties inculcated in them <span id="p178"><sup><small>[ p. 178 ]</small></sup></span> as also the duties in respect of the four modes of life. They who remain observant of the duties of their own order become afflicted, and all mobile and immobile objects undergo a change for the worse. [^446] As the showers of heaven cause all products of the earth to grow, after the same manner the Vedas, in every age, cause all the angas to grow. [^447] Without doubt, Time assumes diverse shapes. It has neither beginning nor end. It is Time which produces all creatures and again devours them. I have already spoken of it to thee. Time is the origin of all creatures; Time is that which makes them grow; Time is that which is their destroyer; and lastly it is time that is their ruler. Subject to pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain, etc.), creatures of infinite variety rest on Time according to their own natures (without being otherwise than how they have been ordained by supreme Brahma).’ [^448]

## SECTION CCXXXIX

“Bhishma said, ‘Thus addressed (by his sire), Suka, highly applauding these instructions of the great _Rishi_, set himself about asking the following, question relating to the import of duties that lead to Emancipation.’

“Suka said, ‘By what means doth one possessed of wisdom, conversant with the Vedas, observant of sacrifices, endued with wisdom, and free from malice, succeed in attaining to _Brahma_ which is incapable of being apprehended by either direct evidence or inference, and unsusceptible of being indicated by the Vedas? Asked by me, tell me by what means is _Brahma_ to be apprehended? Is it by penance, by Brahmacharya, by renunciation of everything, by intelligence, by the aid of the Sankhya philosophy, or by Yoga? By what means may what kind of singleness of purpose be attained by men, with respect to both, _viz_., the mind and the senses? It behoveth thee to expound all this to me.’ [^449]

<span id="p179"><sup><small>[ p. 179 ]</small></sup></span>

“Vyasa said, ‘No man ever attains to success by means other than the acquisition of knowledge, the practice of penances, the subjugation of the senses, and renunciation of everything. [^450] The great entities (five in number) represent the first (or initial) creation of the Self-born. They have been very largely placed in embodied creatures included in the world of life. [^451] The bodies of all embodied creatures are derived from earth. The humours are from water. Their eyes are said to be derived from light. Prana, Apana (and the three other vital breaths) have the wind for their refuge. And, lastly, all unoccupied apertures within them (such as the nostrils, the cavities of the ear, etc.) are of Space. In the feet (of living creatures) is Vishnu. In their arms is Indra. Within the stomach is Agni desirous of eating. In the ears are the points of the horizon (or the compass) representing the sense of hearing. In the tongue is speech which is Saraswati. [^452] The ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose forming the fifth, are said to be the sense of knowledge. These exist for the purposes of apprehension of their respective objects. Sound, touch, form, taste and scent forming the fifth, are the objects of the (five) senses. These should always be regarded as separate from (or independent of) the senses. Like the charioteer setting his well-broken steeds along the paths he pleases, the mind sets the senses (along directions it pleases). The mind, in its turn, is employed by the knowledge sitting in the heart. [^453] The mind is the lord of all these senses in respect of employing them in their functions and guiding or restraining them. Similarly, the knowledge is the lord of the mind (in employing, and guiding or restraining it). [^454] The senses, the objects of the senses, the attributes of those objects represented by the word nature, knowledge, mind, the vital breaths, and Jiva dwell in the bodies of all embodied creatures. [^455] The body within which the knowledge dwells has no real existence. The body, therefore, is not the refuge of the knowledge. Primordial Nature (Prakriti) having the three attributes (of Goodness and Passion and Darkness) is the refuge of the knowledge which exists only in the form of a sound. The Soul also is not the refuge of the knowledge. It is Desire that creates the knowledge. Desire, however, never creates the three <span id="p180"><sup><small>[ p. 180 ]</small></sup></span> attributes. [^456] The man of wisdom, capable of subduing his senses, beholds the seventeenth, _viz_., the Soul, as surrounded by six and ten attributes, in his own knowledge by the aid of the mind. The Soul cannot be beheld with the aid of the eye or with that of all the senses. Transcending all, the Soul becomes visible by only the light of the mind's lamp. Divested of the properties of sound and touch and form, without taste and scent, indestructible and without a body (either gross or subtile) and without senses, it is nevertheless beheld within the body. Unmanifest and supreme, it dwells in all mortal bodies. Following the lead of the preceptor and the Vedas, he who beholds it hereafter becomes Brahma's self. They that are possessed of wisdom look with an equal eye upon a Brahmana possessed of knowledge and disciples, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a Chandala. [^457] Transcending all things, the Soul dwells in all creatures mobile and immobile. Indeed, all things are pervaded by it. [^458] When a living creature beholds his own Soul in all things, and all things in his own Soul, he is said to attain to Brahma. One occupies that much of the Supreme Soul as is commensurate with what is occupied in one's own soul by Vedic sound. [^459]He that can always realise the identity of all things with his own self certainly attains to immortality. The very gods are stupefied in the track of that trackless man who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures, who is engaged in the good of all beings, and who desire <span id="p181"><sup><small>[ p. 181 ]</small></sup></span> to attain to (_Brahma_ which is) the final refuge (of all things). [^460] Indeed, the track which is pursued by men of knowledge is as visible as that of birds in the sky or of fish in water. Time of its own power, cooks all entities within itself. No one, however, knows That in which Time, in its turn, is itself cooked. [^461] That (of which I speak) does not occur above, or in the middle or below, or in transverse or in any other direction. That is to tangible entity; it is not to be found in any place. [^462] All these worlds are within That. There is nothing in these worlds that exists out of that. Even if one goes on ceaselessly with the celerity of a shaft impelled from the bow-string, even if one goes on with the speed of the mind, itself, one would not still reach the end of that which is the cause of all this. [^463] That is so gross that there is nothing grosser. His hands and feet extend everywhere. His eyes, head, and face are everywhere. His ears are everywhere in the universe. He exists overwhelming all things. That is minuter than the minutest, that is the heart of all entities. Existing, without doubt, that is still imperceptible. Indestructible and destructible,—these are the dual forms of existence of the (Supreme) Soul. In all mobile and immobile entities the existence it displays is destructible; while the existence it displays in _Chaitanya_ is celestial, immortal, and indestructible. Though the lord of a existent beings both mobile and immobile, though inactive and divested of attributes, it enters, nevertheless, the well-known mansion of nine doors and becomes engaged in action. [^464] Men of wisdom who are capable of beholding the other shore say that the Unborn (or the Supreme Soul) becomes invested with the attribute of action in consequence of motion, pleasure and pain, variety of form, and the nine well-known possessions. [^465] That indestructible Soul which is said to be invested with the attribute of action is nothing else than that indestructible Soul which is said to be inactive. A person of knowledge, by attaining to that indestructible essence, gives up for good both life and birth.’” [^466]

## SECTION CCXL

“Vyasa said, ‘O excellent son, asked by thee, I have told thee truly what the answer to thy question should be according to the doctrine of knowledge as expounded in the Sankhya system. Listen now to me as I expound to thee all that should be done (for the same end) according to the Yoga doctrine. The uniting together of Intellect and Mind, and all the Senses, and the all-pervading Soul is said to be Knowledge of the foremost kind. That Knowledge should be acquired (through the preceptor's aid) by one that is of a tranquil disposition, that has mastered his senses, that is capable (by meditation) of turning his gaze on the Soul, that takes a pleasure in (such) meditation, that is endued with intelligence and pure in acts. One should seek to acquire this Knowledge by abandoning those five impediments of Yoga which are known to the wise, _viz_., desire, wrath, cupidity, fear, and sleep. Wrath is conquered by tranquillity of disposition. Desire is conquered by giving up all purposes. By reflecting with the aid of the understanding upon topics worthy of reflection, [^467] one endued with patience succeeds in abandoning sleep. By steady endurance one should restrain one's organs of generation and the stomach (from unworthy or sinful indulgence). One should protect one's hands and feet by (using) one's eyes. One should protect one's eyes and ears by the aid of one's mind, one's mind and speech by one's acts. One should avoid fear by heedfulness, and pride by waiting upon the wise. Subduing procrastination, one should, by these means, subdue these impediments of Yoga. One should pay one's adorations to fire and the Brahmanas, and one should bow one's head to the deities. One should avoid all kinds of inauspicious discourse, and speech that is fraught with malice, and words that are painful to other minds. _Brahma_ is the effulgent seed (of everything). It is, again, the essence of that seed whence is all this. [^468] _Brahma_ became the eye, in the form of this mobile and immobile universe, of all entities that took birth. [^469] Meditation, study, gift, truth, modesty, simplicity, forgiveness, purity of body, purity of conduct, subjugation of the senses, these enhance one's energy, which (when enhanced) destroys one's sins. By behaving equally towards all creatures and by living in contentment upon what is acquired easily and without effort, one attains to the fruition of all one's objects and succeeds in obtaining knowledge. Cleansed of all sins, endued with energy, abstemious in diet, with senses under complete control, one should, after having subdued both desire and wrath, seek to attain to Brahma, [^470] Firmly <span id="p183"><sup><small>[ p. 183 ]</small></sup></span> uniting the senses and the mind (having drawn them away from all external objects) with gaze fixed inwards, one should, in the still hours of evening or in those before dawn, place one's mind upon the knowledge. If even one of the five senses of a human being be kept unrestrained, all his wisdom may be seen to escape through it like water through an unstopped hole at the bottom of a leathern bag. The mind in the first instance should be sought to be restrained by the Yogin after the manner of a fisherman seeking at the outset to render that one among the fish powerless from which there is the greatest danger to his nets. Having first subdued the mind, the Yogin should then proceed to subdue his ears, then his eyes, then his tongue, and then his nose. Having restrained these, he should fix them on the mind. Then withdrawing the mind from all purposes, he should fix it on the knowledge. Indeed, having restrained the five senses, the Yati should fix them on the mind. When these the mind for their sixth become concentrated in the knowledge, and thus concentrated remain steady and untroubled, then _Brahma_ becomes perceptible like a smokeless fire of blazing flames or the Sun of effulgent radiance. Indeed, one then beholds in oneself one's soul like lightning fire in the skies. Everything then appears in it and it appears in everything in consequence of its infinitude. Those high-souled Brahmanas that are possessed of wisdom, that are endued with fortitude, that are possessed of high knowledge, and that are engaged in the good of all creatures, succeed in beholding it. Engaged in the observance of austere vows, the Yogin who conducts himself thus for six months, seated by himself on an isolated spot, succeeds in attaining to an equality with the Indestructible. [^471] Annihilation, extension, power to present varied aspects in the same person or body, celestial scents, and sounds, and sights, the most agreeable sensations of taste and touch, pleasurable sensations of coolness and warmth, equality with the wind, capability of understanding (by inward light) the meaning of scriptures and every work of genius, companionship of celestial damsels,—acquiring all these by Yoga the Yogin should disregard them and merge them all in the knowledge. [^472] Restraining speech and the senses one should practise Yoga during the hours after dusk, the hours before dawn, and at dawn of day, seated on a mountain summit, or at the foot of a goodly tree, or with a tree before him. [^473] Restraining all the senses within the heart, one should, with <span id="p184"><sup><small>[ p. 184 ]</small></sup></span> faculties concentrated, think on the Eternal and Indestructible like a man of the world thinking of wealth and other valuable possessions. One should never, while practising Yoga, withdraw one's mind from it. One should with devotion betake oneself to those means by which one may succeed in restraining the mind that is very restless. One should never permit oneself to fall away from it. With the senses and the mind withdrawn from everything else, the Yogin (for practice) should betake himself to empty caves of mountains, to temples consecrated to the deities, and to empty houses or apartments, for living there. One should not associate with another in either speech, act, or thought. Disregarding all things, and eating very abstemiously, the Yogin should look with an equal eye upon objects acquired or lost. He should behave after the same manner towards one that praises and one that censures him. He should not seek the good or the evil of one or the other. He should not rejoice at an acquisition or suffer anxiety when he meets with failure or loss. Of uniform behaviour towards all beings, he should imitate the wind. [^474] Unto one whose mind is thus turned to itself, who leads a life of purity, and who casts an equal eye upon all things,—indeed, unto one who is ever engaged in Yoga thus for even six months,—Brahma as represented by sound appears very vividly. [^475] Beholding all men afflicted with anxiety (on account of earning wealth and comfort), the Yogin should view a clod of earth, a piece of stone, and a lump of gold with an equal eye. Indeed, he should withdraw himself from this path (of earning wealth), cherishing an aversion for it, and never suffer himself to be stupefied. Even if a person happens to belong to the inferior order, even if one happens to be a woman, both of them, by following in the track indicated above, will surely attain to the highest end. [^476] He that has subdued his mind beholds in his own self, by the aid of his own knowledge the Uncreate, Ancient, Undeteriorating, and Eternal Brahma,—That, _viz_., which can not be attained to except by fixed senses,—That which is subtiler than the most subtile, and grosser than the most gross, and which is Emancipation's self.’ [^477]

“Bhishma continued, ‘By ascertaining from the mouths of preceptors and by themselves reflecting with their minds upon these words of the great and <span id="p185"><sup><small>[ p. 185 ]</small></sup></span> high-souled _Rishi_ spoken so properly, persons possessed of wisdom attain to that equality (about which the scriptures say) with Brahman himself, till, indeed, the time when the universal dissolution comes that swallows up all existent beings.’” [^478]

“Suka said, 

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus addressed, the son of Parasara said these words unto his son, ‘I shall expound to thee the two paths, _viz_., the destructible and the indestructible, depending respectively upon acts and knowledge. Listen with concentrated attention, O child, to me, as I tell thee the place that is reached by one with the aid of knowledge, and that other place which is reached with the aid of acts. The difference between these two places is as great as the limitless sky. The question that thou hast asked me has given me such pain as an atheistic discourse gives to a man of faith. These are the two paths upon which the Vedas are established; the duties (acts) indicated by _Pravritti_, and those based on _Nivritti_ that have been treated of so excellently. [^480] By acts, a living creature is destroyed. By knowledge, however, he becomes emancipated. For this reason, Yogins who behold the other side of the ocean of life never betake themselves to acts. Through acts one is forced to take rebirth, after death, with a body composed of the six and ten ingredients. Through knowledge, however, one becomes transformed into that which is Eternal, Unmanifest, and Immutable. One class of persons that are however of little intelligence, applaud acts. In consequence of this they have to assume bodies (one after another) ceaselessly. Those men whose perceptions are keen in respect of duties and who have attained to that high understanding (which leads to knowledge), never applaud acts even as persons that depend for their drinking water upon the supply of streams never applaud wells and tanks. The fruit that one obtains of acts consists of pleasure and pain, of existence and non-existence. By knowledge, one attains to that <span id="p186"><sup><small>[ p. 186 ]</small></sup></span> whither there is no occasion for grief; whither one becomes freed from both birth and death; whither one is not subject to decrepitude; whither one transcends the state of conscious existence. [^481] whither is _Brahma_ which is Supreme, Unmanifest, immutable, ever-existent, imperceptible, above the reach of pain, immortal, and transcending destruction; whither all become freed from the influence of all pairs of opposites (Like pleasure and pain, etc.), as also of wish or purpose. [^482] Reaching that stage, they cast equal eyes on everything, become universal friends and devoted to the good of all creatures. There is a wide gulf, O son, between one devoted to knowledge and one devoted to acts. Know that the man of knowledge, without undergoing destruction, remains existent for ever like the moon on the last day of the dark fortnight existing in a subtle (but undestroyed) form. The great _Rishi_ (Yajnavalkya in Vrihadaranayaka) has said this more elaborately. As regards the man devoted to acts, his nature may be inferred from beholding the new-born moon which appears like a bent thread in the firmament. [^483] Know, O son, that the person of acts takes rebirth with a body with eleven entities, for its ingredients, that are the results of modification, and with a subtile form that represents a total of six and ten. [^484] The deity who takes refuge in that (material) form, like a drop of water on a lotus leaf, should be known as _Kshetrajna_ (Soul), which is Eternal, and which succeeds by Yoga in transcending both the mind and the knowledge. [^485] Tamas, Rajas, and Sattwa are the attributes of the knowledge. The knowledge is the attribute of the individual soul residing within the body. The individual soul, in its turn, comes from the Supreme Soul. [^486] The body with the soul is said to be the attribute of _jiva_. It is _jiva_ that acts and cause all bodies to live. He who has created the seven worlds is said by those that are acquainted with what is _Kshetra_ (and what is Kshetrajna) to be above _jiva_.’”


## SECTION CCXLII

“Suka said, ‘I have now understood that there are two kinds of creation, _viz_., <span id="p187"><sup><small>[ p. 187 ]</small></sup></span> one commencing with _Kshara_ (which is universal), and which is from the (universal) Soul. The other, consisting of the senses with their objects, is traceable to the puissance of the knowledge. This last transcends the other and is regarded to be the foremost. [^487] I desire, however, to once more hear of that course of righteousness which runs in this world, regulated by the virtue of Time and according to which all good men frame their conduct. [^488] In the Vedas there are both kinds of declarations, _viz_., do acts and avoid acts. How shall I succeed in ascertaining the propriety of this or that? It behoveth thee to expound this clearly. [^489] Having obtained, through thy instructions, a thorough knowledge of the course of conduct of human beings, having purified myself by the practice of only righteousness, and having cleansed my understanding, I shall, after casting off my body, behold the indestructible Soul.’ [^490]

“Vyasa said, ‘The course of conduct that was first established by Brahma himself was duly observed by the wise and pious persons of old, _viz_., the great _Rishis_ of ancient times. The great _Rishis_ conquer all the worlds by the practice of Brahmacharya. Seeking all things that are good for himself by fixing the mind on the knowledge, [^491] practising severe austerities by residing in the forest and subsisting on fruits and roots, by treading on sacred spots, by practising universal benevolence, and by going on his rounds of mendicancy at the proper time to the huts of forest recluses when these become smokeless and the sound of the husking rod is hushed, a person succeeds in attaining to _Brahma_. [^492] Abstaining from flattery and from bowing thy heads to others, and avoiding both good and evil, live thou in the forest by thyself, <span id="p188"><sup><small>[ p. 188 ]</small></sup></span> appeasing hunger by any means that comes by the way.’

“Suka said, ‘The declarations of the Vedas (already referred to in respect of acts) are, in the opinion of the vulgar, contradictory. Whether this is authoritative or that is so, when there is this conflict, how can they be said to be scriptural? [^493] I desire to hear this: how can both be regarded as authoritative? How, indeed, can Emancipation be obtained without violating the ordinance about the obligatory character of acts?’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus addressed, the son of Gandhavati, _viz_., the _Rishi_, applauding these words of his son possessed of immeasurable energy, replied unto him, saying the following.’

“Vyasa said, ‘One that is a Brahmacharin, one that leads a life of domesticity, one that is a forest recluse, and one that leads a life of (religious) mendicancy, all reach the same high end by duly observing the duties of their respective modes of life. Or, if one and the same person, freed from desire and aversion, practises (one after another) all these four modes of life according to the ordinances that have been laid down, he is certainly fitted (by such conduct) to understand Brahma. The four modes of life constitute a ladder or flight of steps. That flight is attached to _Brahma_. By ascending that Right one—succeeds in reaching the region of Brahma. For the fourth part of his life, the Brahmacharin, conversant—with the distinctions of duty and freed from malice, should live with his preceptor or his preceptor's son. While residing in the preceptor's house, he should go to bed after the preceptor has gone to his, and rise therefrom before the preceptor rises from his. [^494] All such acts again as should be done by the disciple, as also those which should be done by a menial servant, should be accomplished by him. Finishing these he should humbly take his stand by the side of the preceptor. Skilled in every kind of work, he should conduct himself like a menial servant, doing every act for his preceptor. Having accomplished all acts (without leaving any portion undone), he should study, sitting at the feet of his preceptor, with eager desire to learn. He should always behave with simplicity, avoid evil, speech, and take lessons only when his preceptor invites him for it. [^495] Become pure in body and mind, and acquiring cleverness and other virtues, he <span id="p189"><sup><small>[ p. 189 ]</small></sup></span> should now and then speak what is agreeable. Subduing his senses, he should look at his preceptor without eyes of longing curiosity. [^496] He should never eat before his preceptor has eaten; never drink before his preceptor has drunk; never sit down before his preceptor has sat down; and never go to bed before his preceptor has gone to bed. He should gently touch his preceptor's feet with upturned palms, the right foot with the right and the left with the left. Reverentially saluting the preceptor, he should say unto him, ‘O illustrious one, teach me. I shall accomplish this (work), O illustrious one! This (other work) I have already accomplished. O regenerate one, I am ready to accomplish whatever else thy reverend self may be pleased to command.’ Having said all this, and having duly offered himself unto him (thus), he should accomplish whatever acts of his preceptor wait for accomplishment, and having completed them inform the preceptor once more of their completion. Whatever scents or tastes the Brahmacharin may abstain from while actually leading a life of Brahmacharya may be used by him after his return from the preceptor's abode. This is consistent with the ordinance. Whatever observances have been elaborately laid down for Brahmacharins (in the scriptures) should all be regularly practised by him. He should, again, be always near his preceptor (ready within call). Having contributed to his preceptor's gratification in this way to the best of his powers, the disciple should, from that mode of life, pass into the others (one after another) and practise the duties of each. Having (thus) passed a fourth part of his life in the study of the Vedas, and observance of vows and fasts, and having given the preceptor the (final) fee, the disciple should, according to the ordinance, take his leave and return home (for entering into a life of domesticity). [^497] Then, having taken spouses, obtaining them in the ways indicated in the ordinances, and having carefully established the domestic fire, he should, observant all the while of vows and fasts, become a house-holder and pass the second period of life.’”

## SECTION CCXLIII

“Vyasa said, ‘Observant of meritorious vows, the householder, for the second period of life, should dwell in his house, having taken spouses according to the ways indicated in the ordinance and having established afire (of his own). As regards the domestic mode of life, four kinds of conduct have been laid down by the learned. The first consists of keeping a store of grain sufficient <span id="p190"><sup><small>[ p. 190 ]</small></sup></span> to last for three years. The second consists of keeping a store to last for one year. The third consists of providing for the day without thinking of the morrow. The fourth consists of collecting grain after the manner of the pigeon. [^498] Of these, each succeeding one is superior in point of merit to that which precedes it, according to what has been laid down in the scriptures. [^499] A householder observing the first kind of conduct may practise all the six well-known duties (_viz_., sacrifice on his own account, sacrifice on that of others, teaching, learning, making gifts, and accepting gifts). He who observes the second kind of conduct should practise three only, of these duties (_viz_., learning, giving, and taking). He who observes the third kind of conduct should practise only two of the duties of domesticity (_viz_., learning and giving). The householder practising the fourth kind of domesticity should observe only one duty (_viz_., learning the scriptures). The duties of the householder are all said to be exceedingly meritorious. The householder should never cook any food for only his own use; nor should be slaughter animals (for food) except in sacrifices. [^500] If it be an animal which the householder desires to kill (for food), or if it be a tree which he wishes to cut down (for fuel), he should do either act according to the ritual laid down in the Yajuses for that much is due to both animate and inanimate existences. The house-holder should never sleep during the day, or during the first part of the night, or during the last part thereof. He should never eat twice between morning and evening, and should never summon his wife to bed except in her season. In his house, no Brahmana should be suffered to remain unfed or unworshipped. He should always worship such guests as are presenters of sacrificial offerings, as are cleansed by Vedic lore and observance of excellent vows, as are high-born and conversant with the scriptures, as are observers of the duties of their own order, as are self-restrained, mindful of all religious acts, and devoted to penances. The scriptures ordain that what is offered to the deities and the _Pitris_ in sacrifices and religious rites is meant for the service of guests like these. In this mode of life the scriptures ordain that a share of the food (that is cooked) should be given unto every creature (irrespective of his birth or character), unto one, that is, who for the sake of show keeps his nails and beard, unto one who from pride displays what his own (religious) practices are, unto one who has improperly abandoned his sacred fire, and even unto one who has injured his preceptor. One leading a domestic mode of life should give (food) unto Brahmacharins and Sannyasins. The householder should every day become an eater of _vighasa_, and should <span id="p191"><sup><small>[ p. 191 ]</small></sup></span> every day eat _amrita_. Mixed with clarified butter, the remains of the food that is offered in sacrifices constitute _amrita_. That householder who eats after having fed (all relatives and) servants is said to eat _vighasa_. The food that remains after the servants have been fed is called _vighasa_, and that which is left after the presentation of sacrificial offerings is called _amrita_. One leading a domestic mode of life should be content with his own wedded wife. He should be self-restrained. He should avoid malice and subdue his senses. He should never quarrel with his _Ritwik_, _Purohita_, and preceptor, with his maternal uncle, guests and dependants, with the aged and the young in years, with those that are afflicted with diseases, with those that practise as physicians, with kinsmen, relatives, and friends, with his parents, with women that belong to his own paternal family, with his brother and son and wife, with his daughter, and with his servants. By avoiding disputes with these, the householder becomes cleansed of all sins. By conquering such disputes, he succeeds in conquering all the regions of felicity (in the world hereafter). There is no doubt in this. [^501] The preceptor (if duly reverenced) is able to lead one to the regions of Brahman. The father (if reverenced) can lead to the regions of Prajapati. The guest is puissant enough to lead to the region of Indra. The _Ritwik_ has power in respect of the regions of the deities. Female relatives of the paternal line have lordship in respect of the regions of the _Apsaras_, and kinsmen (by blood), in respect of the region of the Viswedevas. Relatives by marriage and collateral kinsmen have power in respect of the several quarters of the horizon (_viz_., north, etc.), and the mother and the maternal uncle have power over the earth. The old, the young, the afflicted the wasted have power over the sky. [^502] The eldest brother is like unto the sire himself (to all his younger brothers). The wife and the son are one's own body. One's menial servants are one's own shadow. The daughter is an object of great affection. For these reason, a house-holder endued with learning, observant of duties, and possessed of endurance, should bear, without warmth or anxiety of heart every kind of annoyance and even censure from the last named relatives. No righteous household should do any act, urged by considerations of wealth. There are three courses of duty in respect of a life of domesticity. Of these, that which comes next (in the order of enumeration) is more meritorious than the preceding one. [^503] As regards the four (principal) modes of life also, the same rule of merit applies, _viz_., the one that comes after is superior to the one preceding it. Accordingly, domesticity is superior to Brahmacharya, forest life is superior to domesticity, and a life of mendicancy or complete renunciation is superior to a forest life. <span id="p192"><sup><small>[ p. 192 ]</small></sup></span> One desirous of prosperity should accomplish all those duties and rites that have been ordained in the scriptures in respect of those modes. That kingdom grows in prosperity where these highly deserving persons live, _viz_., those that lead a life of domesticity according to the Kumbhadhanya method, they that lead it according to the Unchha method, and they that lead it according to the Kapoti method. [^504] That man who cheerfully leads a life of domesticity in the observance of those duties, succeeds in sanctifying ten generations of his ancestors above and ten generations of descendants below. A householder, duly observing the duties of domesticity, obtains an end that yields felicity equal to what occurs in the regions attained by great kings and emperors. Even this is the end that has been ordained for those who have subdued their senses. For all high-souled householders heaven has been ordained. That heaven is equipped with delightful cars for each (moving at the will of the rider). Even that is the delightful heaven indicated in the Vedas. For all householders of restrained souls, the regions of heaven constitute the high reward. The Self-born Brahman ordained that the domestic mode of life should be the productive cause of heaven. And since it has been so ordained, a person, by gradually attaining to the second mode of life, obtains happiness and respect in heaven. After this comes that high and superior mode of life, called the third, for those that are desirous of casting off their bodies. Superior to that of householders, that is the life of forest recluses,—of those, that is, who waste their bodies (by diverse kinds of austerities) into skeletons overlaid with dried skins. Listen as I discourse to thee upon it.’”


## SECTION CCXLIV

“Bhishma said, ”Though hast been told what the duties of domesticity are as ordained by the wise. Listen now, O Yudhishthira, to what those duties are that have been next spoken of. Gradually abandoning the domestic mode, one should enter the third mode which is excellent. It is the mode in which wives afflict themselves by means of Austerities. It is the mode practised by those that live as forest recluses. Blessed be thou, O son, listen to the duties observed by those that lead this mode of life in which occur the practices of all men and all modes of life. Listen, indeed, to the duties of those that are denizens of sacred spots and that have resorted to this mode after proper deliberation!’

“Vyasa said, ‘When the householder beholds wrinkles on his body and white hair on his head, and children of his children, he should then retire into the forest. The third part of his life he should pass in the observance of the <span id="p193"><sup><small>[ p. 193 ]</small></sup></span> _Vanaprastha_ mode. He should attend to those fires to which he had attended as a householder. Desirous of sacrificing, he should adore the deities (according to the rituals ordained). Observant of vows and abstemious in diet, he should eat only once, the time thereof being the sixth part of the day. He should be always heedful. Attending to his fires, he should keep some kine, waiting upon them dutifully. [^505] He should attend to all the rituals of a sacrifice. He should live upon rice growing indigenously, upon wheat growing under similar circumstances, upon grain of other kinds, growing wildly (and belonging to none). He should eat what remains after feeding guests. In this the third mode of life, he should present offerings of clarified butter in the five well-known Sacrifices. [^506] Four kinds of courses of conduct have been laid down for observance in the Vanaprastha mode of life. Some collect only what is needed for the day. Some collect stores to last for a month. Some store grain and other necessaries sufficient to last for twelve years. Forest recluses may act in these ways for worshipping guests and performing sacrifices. They should during the season of the rains, expose themselves to rain and betake themselves to water during the autumn. During the summer they should sit in the midst of four fires with the sun burning overhead. Throughout the year, however, they should be abstemious in diet. [^507] They sit and sleep on the bare earth. They stand on only their toes. They content themselves with the bare earth and with small mats of grass (owning no other furniture for seat or bed). They perform their ablutions morning, noon, and evening (preparatory to sacrifices). Some amongst them use only teeth for cleaning grain. Others use only stones for that purpose. [^508] Some amongst them drink, only during the lighted fortnight, the gruel of wheat (or other grain) boiled very lightly. [^509] There are many who drink similar gruel only during the dark fortnight. Some eat what only comes by the way (without seeking to obtain it). Some adopting rigid vows, live upon only roots, some upon only fruits, some upon only flowers, duly observing the method followed by the Vaikhanasas. These and other diverse observances are adopted by those men of wisdom and piety. The fourth is (the mode called Renunciation) based upon the Upanishads. The duties laid down for it may be observed in all the modes of life equally. This mode differing from the others comes _after_ domesticity and forest life. In this very Yuga, O son, <span id="p194"><sup><small>[ p. 194 ]</small></sup></span> many learned Brahmanas conversant with the truths of all things, have been known to observe this mode. Agastya, the seven _Rishis_ (_viz_., Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Vasishtha, Narada, and Kratu), Madhucchandas, Aghamarshana, Sankriti Sudivatandi who lived withersoever he pleased and was content to take what came (without ever seeking for anything). [^510] Ahovirya Kavya, Tandya, the learned Medhatithi, Karmanirvaka of mighty energy, and Sunyapala who had exerted himself greatly (for acquiring ascetic puissance) were the authors of this course of duties, and themselves observing them have all proceeded to heaven. Many great _Rishis_, O son, who had the puissance to behold immediately the fruits of their ascetic merit, [^511] those numerous ascetics who are known by the name of Yayavaras, many _Rishis_ of very austere penances and possessed of accurate knowledge in respect of distinctions of duty, and many other Brahmanas too numerous to mention, adopted the forest mode of life. The Vaikhanasas, the Valikhilyas, the Saikatas, all of whom were devoted to austere penances, [^512] who were steadfast in virtue, who had subdued their senses, and who used to behold the fruits of their penances immediately, adopted this mode of life and finally ascended to heaven. Freed from fear and not counted among the stars and planets, these have become visible in the firmament as luminous bodies. [^513] When the fourth or last part of life is reached, and when one is weakened by decrepitude and afflicted by disease, one should abandon the forest mode of life (for the fourth mode called Renunciation). Performing a sacrifice that is capable of being completed in a single day and in which the _Dakshina_ should be everything of which he may be possessed, he should himself perform his own _Sraddha_. Withdrawn from every other object, he should devote himself to his own self, taking pleasure in himself, and resting also on his own self. [^514] He should establish all his sacrificial fires (thenceforth) upon his own self, and give up all kinds of ties and attachments. (In case he fails to attain to complete Renunciation) he should always perform such sacrifices and rites as are completed in a single day. [^515] When, however, from performance of the (ordinary) sacrifices of sacrificers, the Sacrifice in Self proceeds, then (may he discontinue all ordinary sacrifices, and) unto the three fires duly sacrifice in <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> his own Self for the sake of his Emancipation. [^516] Without finding fault with his food he should eat five or six mouthfuls, offering them duly unto five vital airs uttering (every time the well-known) _mantras_ of the Yajurveda. [^517] Engaged in the observance of austerities while leading the life of a forest recluse, one should shave off one's hair and bristles and pare off one's nails, and having cleansed oneself by acts, pass into the fourth and last mode of life that is fraught with great holiness. [^518] That regenerate person who enters the fourth mode of life, giving pledges of assurance unto all creatures, succeeds in earning many regions of blazing effulgence hereafter and ultimately attains to the Infinite. [^519] Of excellent disposition and conduct, with sins all washed off, the person who is conversant with his own self never desires to do any act for either this or the other world. Freed from wrath and from error, without anxiety and without friendship, such a person lives in this world like one totally uninterested in its concerns. One (in the observance of Sannyasa) should not feel reluctant in discharging the duties included in _Yama_ and those also that walk behind them (and are included in _niyama_). Such a one should with energy live according to the ordinances in respect of his own mode, and throw away Vedic study and the sacred thread that is indicative of the order of his birth. Devoted to righteousness and with his senses under complete control, such a one, possessed of knowledge of self, attains undoubtedly to the end for which he strives. [^520] After the third is the fourth <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> mode of life. It is very superior, and fraught with numerous high virtues. It transcends in point of merit the three other modes of life. It is said to occupy the highest place. Listen to me as I discourse upon the duties that belong to that mode which is pre-eminent and which is the high refuge of all!'”

## SECTION CCXLV

“Suka said, ‘While living in the due observance of the duties of the foremost of life, how should one, who seeks to attain to That which is the highest object of knowledge, set one's soul on Yoga according to the best of one's power?’

“Vyasa said, ‘Having acquired (purity of conduct and body) by the practice of the first two modes of life, _viz_., Brahmacharya and domesticity, one should, after that, set one's soul on Yoga in the third mode of life. Listen now with concentrated attention to what should be done for attaining to the highest object of acquisition! [^521] Having subdued all faults of the mind and of heart by easy means in the practice of the first three modes of life (_viz_., pupilage, domesticity, and seclusion) one should pass into the most excellent and the most eminent of all the modes, _viz_., Sannyasa or Renunciation. Do thou then pass thy days, having acquired that purity. Listen also to me. One should, alone and without anybody to assist him or bear him company, practise Yoga for attaining to success (in respect of one's highest object of acquisition). One who practises Yoga without companionship, who beholds everything as a repetition of his own self, and who never discards anything (in consequence of all things being pervaded by the Universal Soul), never falls away from Emancipation. Without keeping the sacrificial fires and without a fixed habitation, such a person should enter a village for only begging his food. He should provide himself for the day without storing for the morrow. He should betake himself to penances, with heart fixed on the Supreme. [^522] Eating little and that even under proper regulations, he should not eat more than once a day. The other indications of a (religious) mendicant are the human skull, shelter under trees, rags for wearing, solitude unbroken by the companionship of any one, and indifference to all creatures. [^523] That <span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span> person into whom words enter like affrighted elephants into a well, and from whom they never come back to the speaker, is fit to lead this mode of life which has Emancipation for its object. [^524] The mendicant (or Renouncer) should never take note of the evil acts of any person. He should never hear what is said in dispraise of others. Especially should he avoid speaking evil of a Brahmana. He should always say only what is agreeable to the Brahmanas. When anything is said in dispraise (of himself), he should (without answering) remain perfectly silent. Such silence, indeed, is the medical treatment prescribed for him. That person in consequence of whose single self the place he occupies becomes like the eastern sky, and who can make a spot teeming with thousands of men and things appear to himself perfectly solitary or unoccupied, is regarded by the deities to be a true _Brahmana_. [^525] Him the gods know for a Brahmana who clothes himself with whatever comes by the way, who subsists upon whatever he gets, and who sleeps on whatever spot he finds. Him the gods know for a Brahmana who is afraid of company as of a snake; of the full measure of gratification (from sweet viands and drinks) as of hell; and of women as of a corpse. [^526] Him the gods know for a Brahmana who is never glad when honoured and never angry when insulted, and who has given assurances of compassion unto all creatures. One in the observance of the last mode of life should not view death with joy. Nor should he view life with joy. He should only wait for his hour like a servant waiting for the behest (of his master). He should purify his heart of all faults. He should purify his speech of all faults. He should cleanse himself of all sins. As he has no foes, what fear can assail him? He who fears no creature and whom no creature fears, can have no fear from any quarter, freed as he is from error of every kind. As the footprints of all other creatures that move upon legs are engulfed within those of elephants, after the same manner all ranks and conditions are absorbed within Yoga [^527]. After the same manner, every other duty and observance is supposed to be <span id="p198"><sup><small>[ p. 198 ]</small></sup></span> engulfed within the one duty of abstention from injury (to all creatures). [^528] He lives an everlasting life of felicity who avoids injuring other creatures. One who abstains from injury, who casts an equal eye upon all creatures, who is devoted to truth, who is endued with fortitude, who has his senses under control, and who grants protection to all beings, attains to an end that is beyond compare. The condition called death succeeds not in transcending such a person who is content with self-knowledge, who is free from fear, and who is divested of desire and expectancy. On the other hand, such a person succeeds in transcending death. Him the gods know for a Brahmana who is freed from attachments of every kind, who is observant of penances, who lives like space which while holding everything is yet unattached to any thing, who has nothing which he calls his own, who leads a life of solitude, and whose is tranquillity of soul. The gods know him for a Brahmana whose life is for the practice of righteousness, whose righteousness is for the good of them that wait dutifully upon him, and whose days and nights exist only for the acquisition of merit. [^529] The gods know him for a Brahmana who is freed from desire, who never exerts himself for doing such acts as are done by worldly men, who never bends his head unto any one, who never flatters another, (and who is free from attachments of every kind). All creatures are pleased with happiness and filled with fear at the prospect of grief. The man of faith, therefore, who should feel distressed at the prospect of filling other creatures with grief, must abstain entirely from acts of every kind. [^530] The gift of assurances of harmlessness unto all creatures transcends in point of merit all other gifts. He who, at the outset, forswears the religion of injury, succeeds in attaining to Emancipation (in which or) whence is the assurance of harmlessness unto all creatures. [^531] That man who does not pour into his open mouth even the five or six mouthfuls that are laid down for the forest recluse, is said to be the navel of the world, and the refuge of the universe. The head and other limbs, as also the acts good and bad, become possessed by Fire. Such a man, who sacrifices in his own self, makes a liberation of his senses and mind into the fire that dwells within the limited space of his own <span id="p199"><sup><small>[ p. 199 ]</small></sup></span> heart. In consequence again of his pouring such a libation into such a fire within his own self, the universe with all creatures including the very gods, becomes gratified. [^532] They who apprehend the _Jiva_\-soul that is endued with effulgence, that is enveloped in three cases, that has three attributes for its characteristics, to be _Iswara_ partaking of that which is foremost, _viz_., the nature of the Supreme Soul, becomes object of great regard in all the worlds. The very gods with all human beings speak highly of their merits. He who succeeds in beholding in the soul that resides in his own body all the Vedas, space and the other objects of perception, the rituals that occur in scriptures, all those entities that are comprehensible in sound only and the superior nature of the Supreme Soul, is sought to be worshipped by the very deities as the foremost of all beings. He who sees in the soul that resides within his body, that foremost of beings which is not attached to the earth, which is immeasurable in even the (measureless) firmament, which is made of gold, which is born of the egg and resides within the egg, which is equipped with many feathers, and which has two wings like a bird, and which is rendered effulgent by many rays of light, is sought to be worshipped by the very deities as the foremost of all beings. [^533] The very deities worship him in whose understanding is set the wheel of Time, which is constantly resolving, which knows no decay, which swallows up the period of existence of every creature, which has the six seasons for its naves, which is equipped with two and ten radii consisting of the two and ten months, which has excellent joint, and towards whose gaping mouth proceeds this universe (ready to be devoured). [^534] The Supreme Soul is the capacious unconsciousness of dreamless slumber. That Unconsciousness is the body of the universe. It pervadeth all created things. _Jiva_, occupying a portion of that capacious unconsciousness gratifies the deities. These last, being gratified, gratify the open mouth of that unconsciousness. [^535] Endued with effulgence as also with the principle of eternity, <span id="p200"><sup><small>[ p. 200 ]</small></sup></span> _Jiva_ is without a beginning. It acquires (by following particular paths) infinite regions of eternal happiness. He of whom no creature is afraid, has never to fear any creature. He who never does anything censurable and who never censures another, is said to be a truly regenerate person. Such a man succeeds in beholding the Supreme Soul. He whose ignorance has been dispelled and whose sins have been washed away, never enjoys either here or hereafter the happiness that is enjoyed by others (but attains to complete Emancipation). A person in the observance of the fourth mode of life wanders on the earth like one unconnected with everything. Such a one is freed from wrath and error. Such a one regards a clod of earth and lump of gold with an equal eye. Such a man never stores anything for his use. Such a one has no friends and foes. Such a one is utterly regardless of praise or blame, and of the agreeable and the disagreeable.’”

“Vyasa said, ‘The _Jiva_\-soul is endued with all those entities that are modifications of Prakriti. These do not know the Soul but the Soul knows them all. Like a good driver proceeding with the aid of strong, well-broken, and high-mettled steeds along the paths he selects, the Soul acts with the aid of these, called the senses, having the mind for their sixth. The objects of the senses are superior to the senses themselves. The mind is superior to those objects. The understanding is superior to the mind. The Soul, also called Mahat, is superior to the understanding. Superior to _Mahat_ is the Unmanifest (or Prakriti). Superior to the Unmanifest is _Brahma_. There is nothing Superior to _Brahma_. That is the highest limit of excellence and the highest goal. The Supreme Soul is concealed in every creature. It is not displayed for ordinary men to behold. Only Yogins with subtile vision behold the Supreme Soul with the aid of their keen and subtile understanding. Merging the senses having the mind for their sixth and all the objects of the senses into the inner Soul by the aid of the Understanding, and reflecting upon the three states of consciousness, _viz_., the object thought, the act of thinking, and the thinker, and abstaining by contemplation from every kind of enjoyment, equipping his mind with the knowledge that he is _Brahma's_ self, laying aside at the same time all consciousness of puissance, and thereby making his soul perfectly tranquil, the Yogin obtains that to which immortality inheres. That person, however, who happens to be the slave of all his senses and whose ideas of right and wrong have been confounded, already liable as he is to death, actually meets with death by such surrender of self to (the passions). [^536] Destroying <span id="p201"><sup><small>[ p. 201 ]</small></sup></span> all desires, one should merge the gross Understanding into one's subtile Understanding. Having thus merged the gross into the subtile Understanding, one is sure to become a second Kalanjara mountain. [^537] By purifying his heart, the Yogin transcends both righteousness and its reverse. By purifying his heart and by living in his own true nature, he attains to the highest happiness. [^538] The indication of that purity of heart (of which I speak) is that one who has attained to experiences that state of unconsciousness (with respect of all one's surroundings) which one experiences in dreamless slumber. The Yogin who has attained to that state lives like the steady flame of a lamp that burns in a place where the atmosphere is perfectly still. Becoming abstemious in diet, and having cleansed his heart, that Yogin who applies his Soul to the Soul succeeds in beholding the Soul in the Soul. [^539] This discourse, O son, intended for thy instruction, is the essence of all the Vedas. The truths herein disclosed are incapable of being understood by the aid of inference alone or by that of mere study of the scriptures. One must understand it oneself by the aid of faith. By churning the wealth that is contained in all religious works and in all discourses based on truth, as also the ten thousand _Richs_, this nectar hath been raised. As butter from curds and fire from wood, even hath this been raised for the sake of my son,—this that constituteth the knowledge of all truly wise men. This discourse, O son, fraught with solid instruction, is intended for delivery unto _Snatakas_. [^540] It should never be imparted to one that is not of tranquil soul, or one that is not self-restrained, or one that hath not undergone penances. It should not be communicated to one that is not conversant with the Vedas, or one that doth not humbly wait upon one's preceptor, or one that is not free from malice, or one that is not possessed of sincerity and candour, or one that is of reckless behaviour. It should never be communicated to one whose intellect hath been consumed by the science of disputation, or one that is vile or low. Unto that person, however, who is possessed of fame, or who deserveth applause (for his virtues), or who is of tranquil soul, or possessed of ascetic merit, unto a Brahmana who is such, unto one's son or dutiful disciple, this discourse containing the <span id="p202"><sup><small>[ p. 202 ]</small></sup></span> very essence of duties should be communicated, but on no account should it be communicated to others. If any person makes a gift of the whole earth with all her treasures, unto one conversant with truth, the latter would still regard the gift of this knowledge to be very much superior to that gift. I shall now discourse to thee on a subject that is a greater mystery than this, a subject that is connected with the Soul, that transcends the ordinary understandings of human beings, that has been beheld by the foremost of _Rishis_, that has been treated in the Upanishads, and that forms the topic of thy inquiry. Tell me what, after this is in thy mind? Tell me in what thou has still any doubt? Listen, for here I am, O son, faces turned towards all directions. The Sun and the Moon are thy two seated before thee! Upon what indeed, shall I once more speak to thee?'”

“Suka said, ‘O illustrious one, O foremost of _Rishis_, once again discourse to me on _Adhyatma_ more elaborately. Tell me what, indeed, is Adhyatma and whence does it come?’ [^541]

“Vyasa said, ‘That, O son, which is regarded as _Adhyatma_ with reference to human beings, I shall now mention to thee, and listen to the explanation I give (of _Adhyatma_). Earth, water, light, wind, and space, are the great entities that form the component parts of all creatures, and, though really one, are yet regarded different like the waves of the ocean (which though identical with respect to their constituent substance are yet counted as different from one another). Like a tortoise stretching out its limbs and withdrawing them again, the great entities (already named), by dwelling in numberless small forms, undergo transformations (called creation and destruction). All this universe of mobile and immobile objects hath for its component parts these five entities. Everything, in respect of its creation and destruction, is referable to this fivefold entity. These five entities occur in all existent things. The Creator of all things, however, hath made an unequal distribution of those entities (by placing them in different things in different proportions) for serving different ends.’ [^542]

“Suka said, ‘How may one succeed in understanding that unequal distribution (of the five great entities of which thou speakest) in the diverse things of the universe? Which amongst them are the senses and which the attributes? How may this be understood?’

<span id="p203"><sup><small>[ p. 203 ]</small></sup></span>

“Vyasa said, ‘I shall explain thee this duly one after another. Listen with concentrated attention to the subject as I expound how what I have said actually happens. Sound, the sense of hearing, and all the cavities within the body,—these three—have space for their origin. The vital breaths, the action of the limbs and touch form the attributes of the wind. Form, eyes, and the digestive fire within the stomach, are originated by light. Taste, tongue, and all the humours,—these three,—are from water. Scent, nose, and the body,—these three,—are the attributes of earth. These, then, as I have expounded to thee, are the transformations of the five (great) entities with senses. Touch is said to be the attribute of the wind; taste of water; form of light. Sound is said to have its origin in space, and scent is said to be the property of earth. Mind, Understanding, and Nature,—these three,—spring from their own previous states, and attaining (at each rebirth) to a position higher than the attributes (which form their respective objects), do not transcend those attributes. [^543] As the tortoise stretches out its limbs and withdraws them once again within itself, even so the Understanding creates the senses and once again withdraws them into itself. [^544] The consciousness of personal identity that arises in respect of that which is above the soles of the feet and below the crown of the head, is principally due to the action of the Understanding. [^545] It is the understanding that is transformed into the (five) attributes (of form, scent, etc.). It is understanding also that is transformed into the (five) senses with the mind for the sixth. When the Understanding is absent, where are the attributes? [^546] In man there are five senses. The mind is called the sixth (sense). The Understanding is called the seventh. The Soul is the eighth. The eyes (and the other senses) are for only receiving impressions of form (and scent, etc.). The mind exists for doubting (the accuracy of those impressions). The Understanding <span id="p204"><sup><small>[ p. 204 ]</small></sup></span> settles those doubts. The Soul is said only to witness every operation without mingling with them. Rajas, Tamas, and Sattwa,—these three,—arise from their own counterparts. These exist equal in all creatures (_viz_., the deities and human beings, etc.). These are called attributes and should be known by the actions they induce. [^547] As regards those actions all such states in which one becomes conscious of oneself as united with cheerfulness or joy and which are tranquil and pure, should be known as due to the attribute of Sattwa. All such states in either the body or the mind, as are united with sorrow, should be regarded as due to the influence of the attribute called Rajas. All such states again as exist with stupefication (of the senses, the mind or the understanding) whose cause is unascertainable, and which are incomprehensible (by either reasons or inward light), should be known as ascribable to the action of Tamas. Delight, cheerfulness, joy, equanimity, contentment of heart, due to any known cause or arising otherwise, are all effects of the attribute of Sattwa. Pride, untruthfulness of speech, cupidity, stupefication, vindictiveness, whether arising from any known cause or otherwise, are indications of the quality of Rajas. Stupefaction of judgment, heedlessness, sleep, lethargy, and indolence, from whatever cause these may arise, are to be known as indications of the quality of Tamas.’” [^548]


## SECTION CCXLVIII

“Vyasa said, ‘The mind creates (within itself) numerous ideas (of objects or existent things). The Understanding settles which is which. The heart discriminates which is agreeable and which is disagreeable. These are the three forces that impel to acts. The objects of the senses are superior to the senses. The mind is superior to those objects. The understanding is superior to mind. The Soul is regarded as superior to Understanding. (As regards the ordinary purposes of man) the Understanding is his Soul. When the understanding, of its own motion, forms ideas (of objects) within itself, it then comes to be called Mind. [^549] In consequence of the senses being different from one another (both in respect of their objects and the manner of their operation), the Understanding (which is one and the same) present different aspect in consequence <span id="p205"><sup><small>[ p. 205 ]</small></sup></span> of its different modifications. When it hears, it becomes the organ of hearing, and when it touches, it becomes the organ of touch. Similarly, when it sees, it becomes the organ of vision, and when it tastes, it becomes the organ of taste, and when it smells, it becomes the organ of scent. It is the Understanding that appears under different guises (for different functions) by modification. It is the modifications of the Understanding that are called the senses. Over them is placed as their presiding chief (or overseer) the invisible Soul. Residing in the body, the Understanding exists in the three states (of Sattwa, Rajas, and, Tamas). Sometimes it obtains cheerfulness, sometimes it gives way to grief; and sometimes its condition becomes such that it is united with neither cheerfulness nor grief. The Understanding, however, whose chief function (as already said) is to create entities, transcends those three states even as the ocean, that lord of rivers, prevails against the mighty currents of the rivers that fall into it. [^550] When the Understanding desires for anything, it comes to be called by the name of Mind. The senses again, though (apparently different) should all be taken as included within the Understanding. The senses, which are engaged in bearing impressions of form, scent etc., should all be subdued. [^551] When a particular sense becomes subservient to the Understanding, the latter though in reality not different (from that sense), enters the Mind in the form of existent things. Even this is what happens with the senses one after another (separately and not simultaneously) with reference to the ideas that are said to be apprehended by them. [^552] All the three states that exist (_viz_., Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas), inhere to these three (_viz_., Mind, Understanding, and Consciousness) and like the spokes of a car-wheel acting in consequence of their attachment to the circumference of the wheel, they follow the different objects (that exist in Mind, Understanding, and Consciousness). [^553] The mind must make a lamp <span id="p206"><sup><small>[ p. 206 ]</small></sup></span> of the senses for dispelling the darkness that shuts out the knowledge of the Supreme Soul. This knowledge that is acquired by Yogins with the aid of all especial agency of Yoga, is acquired without any especial efforts by men that abstain from worldly objects. [^554] The universe is of this nature (_viz_., it is only a creation of the understanding). The man of knowledge, therefore, is never stupefied (by attachment to things of this world). Such a man never grieves, never rejoices, and is free from envy (at seeing another possessing a larger share of earthly objects). The Soul is incapable of being seen with the aid of the senses whose nature is to wander among all (earthly) objects of desire. Even righteous men, whose senses are pure, fail to behold the soul with their aid, what then should be said of the vicious whose senses are impure? When, however, a person, with the aid of his mind, tightly holds their reins, it is then that his Soul discovers itself like an object (unseen in darkness) appearing to the view in consequence of the light of a lamp. Indeed, as all things become visible when the darkness that envelopes them is dispelled, even the soul becomes visible when the darkness that covers it is removed. [^555] As an aquatic fowl, though moving on the water, is never drenched by that element, after the same manner the Yogin of freed soul is never soiled by the imperfections of the three attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas). After the same manner, the man of wisdom, by even enjoying all earthly objects without being attached to any of them, is never soiled by faults of any kind that arise in the case of others from such enjoyment. He who avoids acts after having done them duly, [^556] and takes delight in the one really existent entity, _viz_., the Soul, who has constituted himself the soul of all created beings, and who succeeds in keeping himself aloof from the three attributes, obtains an understanding and senses that are created by the Soul. The qualities are incapable of apprehending the Soul. The Soul, however, apprehends them always. The Soul is the witness that beholds the qualities and duly calls them up into being. Behold, this is the difference between the understanding and the Soul both of which are exceedingly subtile. One of them creates the qualities. The other never creates them. Though they are different from each other by nature, yet they are always united. The fish living in the water is different from the element in which it lives. But as the fish and the water forming its home are always united, after the same manner Sattwa and Kshetrajna exists in a state of union. The gnat born within a rotten fig is really not the fig but different <span id="p207"><sup><small>[ p. 207 ]</small></sup></span> from it. Nevertheless, as the gnat and the fig are seen to be united with each other, even so are Sattwa and Kshetrajna. As the blade in a clump of grass, though distinct from the clump, nevertheless exists in a state of union with it, even so these two, though different from each other, each existing in its own self, are to be seen in a state of constant union.’”


## SECTION CCXLIX

“Vyasa said, ‘The objects by which one is surrounded are created by the understanding. The Soul, without being connected with them, stands aloof, presiding over them. It is the understanding that creates all objects. The three primary qualities are continually being transformed (for the production of objects). The Kshetrajna or Soul, endued with puissance, presides, over them all, without, however, mingling with them. [^557] The objects which the understanding creates partake of its own nature. Indeed, as the spider creates threads (which partakes of its own material substance), the objects created by the understanding partake of the nature of the understanding. Some maintain that the qualities, when driven away by Yoga or knowledge, do not cease to exist. They say this because when once gone, the indications only of their return are not perceptible. (But that is no evidence of their actual destruction). Others say that when dispelled by knowledge, they are at once destroyed never to return. [^558] Reflecting upon these two opinions properly, one should strive one's best according to the way one thinks proper. It is by this way that one should attain to eminence and take refuge in one's own Soul alone. [^559] The Soul is without beginning and without end. Comprehending his Soul properly man should move and act, without giving way to wrath, without indulging in joy, and always free from envy. Cutting by this means the knot that is in one's heart, the knot whose existence is due to the operation of the faculties of the understanding, which is hard (to open or cut), but which nevertheless is capable of being destroyed by knowledge, one should live happily, without giving way to grief (for anything that happens), and with one's doubts dispelled. Know that they who mingle in the affairs of this world are as distressed in body and mind as persons ignorant of the art of swimming <span id="p208"><sup><small>[ p. 208 ]</small></sup></span> when they slip from the land and fall into a large and deep river. The man of learning, however, being conversant with the truth, is never distressed, for he feels like one walking over solid land. Indeed, he who apprehends his Soul to be such, _viz_., as presenting only the character of _Chit_ which has knowledge alone for its indication, is never distressed. Indeed, a person, by thus comprehending the origin and end of all creatures, and by thus apprehending their inequalities or distinctions, succeeds in attaining to high felicity. This knowledge is the possession of a Brahmana in especial by virtue of his birth. Knowledge of the Soul, and felicity like that which has been adverted to, are each fully sufficient to lead to emancipation. [^560] By acquiring such knowledge one really becomes learned. What else is the indication of a person of knowledge? Having acquired such knowledge, they that are wise among men regard themselves crowned with success and become emancipated. [^561] Those things that become sources of fear unto men destitute of knowledge do not become sources of fear unto those that are endued with knowledge. There is no end higher than the eternal end which is obtained by a person possessed of knowledge. One beholds with aversion all earthly objects of enjoyment which are, of course, fraught with faults of every kind. Another, beholding others betake themselves with pleasure to such objects, is filled with sorrow. As regards this matter, however, they that are conversant with both objects, behold, _viz_., that which is fictitious and that which is not so, never indulge in sorrow and are truly happy. [^562] That which a man does without expectation of fruits destroys his acts of a former life. The acts, however, of such a person both of this and his previous life cannot lead to Emancipation. On the other hand, such destruction of former acts and such acts of this life cannot lead to what is disagreeable (_viz_., hell), even if the man of wisdom engages in acts.’” [^563]


## SECTION CCL

“Suka said, ‘Let thy reverence tell me of that which is the foremost of all duties, indeed, of that duty above which no higher one exists in this world.’

“Vyasa said, ‘I shall now tell thee of duties having a very ancient origin and laid down by the _Rishis_, duties that are distinguished above all others. <span id="p209"><sup><small>[ p. 209 ]</small></sup></span> Listen to me with undivided attention. The senses that are maddening should carefully be restrained by the understanding like a sire restraining his own inexperienced children liable to fall into diverse evil habits. The withdrawal of the mind and the senses from all unworthy objects and their due concentration (upon worthy objects) is the highest penance. That is the foremost of all duties. Indeed, that is said to be the highest duty. Directing, by the aid of the understanding, the senses having the mind for their sixth, and without, indeed, thinking of worldly objects which have the virtue of inspiring innumerable kinds of thought, one should live contented with one's own self. When the senses and the mind, withdrawn from the pastures among which they usually run loose, come back for residing in their proper abode, it is then that thou wilt behold in thy own self the Eternal and Supreme Soul. [^564] Those high-souled Brahmanas that are possessed of wisdom succeed in beholding that Supreme and Universal Soul which is like unto a blazing fire in effulgence. As a large tree endued with numerous branches and possessed of many flowers and fruits does not know in which part it has flowers and in which it has fruits, after the same manner the Soul as modified by birth and other attributes, does not know whence it has come and whither it is to go. There is, however, an inner Soul, which beholds (knows) everything. [^565] One sees the Soul oneself with the aid of the lighted lamp of knowledge. Beholding, therefore, thyself with thy own self, cease to regard thy body as thyself and attain thou to omniscience. Cleansed of all sins, like unto a snake that has cast off its slough, one attains to high intelligence here and becomes free from every anxiety and the obligation of acquiring a new body (in a subsequent birth). Its current spreading in diverse directions, frightful is this river of life bearing the world onward in its course. The five senses are its crocodiles. The mind and its purposes are the shores. Cupidity and stupefaction of judgment are the grass and straw that float on it, covering its bosom. Lust and wrath are the fierce reptiles that live in it. Truth forms the _tirtha_ by its miry banks. Falsehood forms its surges, anger its mire. Taking its rise from the Unmanifest, rapid is its current, and incapable of being crossed by persons of uncleansed souls. Do thou, with the aid of the understanding cross that river having desires for its alligators. The world and its concerns constitute the ocean towards which that river runs. Genus and species constitute its unfathomable depth that none can understand. One's birth, O child, is the source from which that stream takes its rise. Speech constitutes its eddies. Difficult to cross, only men of learning and <span id="p210"><sup><small>[ p. 210 ]</small></sup></span> wisdom and understanding succeed in crossing it. Crossing it, thou wilt succeed in freeing thyself from every attachment, acquiring a tranquil heart, knowing the Soul, and becoming pure in every respect. Relying them on a purged and elevated understanding, thou wilt succeed in becoming _Brahma's_ self. Having dissociated thyself from every worldly attachment, having acquired a purified Soul and transcending every kind of sin, look thou upon the world like a person looking from the mountain top upon creatures creeping below on the earth's surface. Without giving way to wrath or joy, and without forming any cruel wish, thou wilt succeed in beholding the origin and the destruction of all created objects. They that are endued with wisdom regard such an act to be the foremost of all things. Indeed, this act of crossing the river of life is regarded by the foremost of righteous persons, by ascetics conversant with the truth, to be the highest of all acts that one can accomplish. This knowledge of the all-pervading Soul is intended to be imparted to one's son. It should be inculcated unto one that is of restrained senses, that is honest in behaviour, and that is docile or submissive. This knowledge of the Soul, of which I have just now spoken to thee, O child, and the evidence of whose truth is furnished by the Soul itself, is a mystery,—indeed, the greatest of all mysteries, and the very highest knowledge that one can attain. _Brahma_ hath no sex,—male, female, or neuter. It is neither sorrow nor happiness. It hath for its essence the past, the future, and the present. Whatever one's sex, male or female, the person that attains to the knowledge of _Brahma_ hath never to undergo rebirth. This duty (of Yoga) hath been inculcated for attaining to exemption from rebirth. [^566] These words that I have used for answering thy question lead to Emancipation in the same way as the diverse other opinions advanced by diverse other sages that have treated of this subject. I have expounded the topic to thee after the manner in which it should be expounded. Those opinions sometimes become productive of fruit and sometimes not. (The words, however, that I have used are of a different kind, for these are sure to lead to success). [^567] For this reason, O good child, a preceptor, when asked by a contented, meritorious, and self-restrained son or disciple, should, with a delighted heart, inculcate, according to their true import, these instructions that I have inculcated for the benefit of thee, my son!'”


## SECTION CCLI

“Vyasa said, ‘One should not show any affection for scents and tastes and <span id="p211"><sup><small>[ p. 211 ]</small></sup></span> other kinds of enjoyment. Nor should one accept ornaments and other articles contributing to the enjoyment of the senses of scent and taste. One should not covet honour and achievements and fame. Even this is the behaviour of a Brahmana possessed of vision. [^568] He that hath studied all the Vedas, having waited dutifully on his preceptor and observed the vow of Brahmacharya, he that knows all the Richs, Yajuses, and Samans, is not a regenerate person. [^569] One that behaves towards all creatures as if one is their kinsman, and one that is acquainted with _Brahma_, is said to be conversant with all the Vedas. One that is divested of desire (being contented with knowledge of the Soul), never dies. It is by such a behaviour and such a frame of mind that one becomes a truly regenerate person. [^570] Having performed only various kinds of religious rites and diverse sacrifices completed with gift of _Dakshina_, one does not acquire the status of a Brahmana if he is devoid of compassion and hath not given up desire. [^571] When one ceases to fear all creatures and when all creatures cease to fear one, when one never desires for anything nor cherishes aversion for anything, then he is said to attain to the status of _Brahma_. When one abstains from injuring all creatures in thought, speech, and act, then he is said to acquire the status of _Brahma_. There is only one kind of bondage in this world, _viz_., the bondage of desire, and no other. One that is freed from the bondage of desire attains to the status of _Brahma_. Freed from desire like the Moon emerged from murky clouds, the man of wisdom, purged of all stains, lives in patient expectation of his time. That person into whose mind all sorts of desire enter like diverse streams falling into the ocean without being able to enhance its limits by their discharge, succeeds in obtaining tranquillity, but not he who cherishes desire for all earthly objects. Such a person becomes happy in consequence of the fruition of all his wishes, and not he who cherishes desire for earthly objects. The latter, even if he attains to heaven, has to fall away from it. [^572] The Vedas have truth for their recondite object. Truth hath the subjugation of the senses for its recondite object. The subjugation of the senses hath charity for its recondite object. Charity hath penance for its recondite object. Penance hath renunciation for its recondite object. Renunciation hath happiness for its recondite object. Happiness hath heaven for its recondite object. Heaven hath tranquillity for its recondite object. [^573] For the sake of contentment <span id="p212"><sup><small>[ p. 212 ]</small></sup></span> thou shouldst wish to obtain a serene understanding which is a precious possession, being indicative of Emancipation, and which, scorching grief and all purposes or doubts together with thirst, destroys them completely in the end. [^574] One possessed of those six attributes, _viz_., contentment, grieflessness, freedom from attachment, peacefulness, cheerfulness, and freedom from envy, is sure to become full or complete. [^575] They that, transcending all consciousness of body, know the Soul which resides within the body and which is understood by only persons of wisdom with the aid of the six entities (already mentioned, _viz_., the Vedas and truth, etc.) when endowed with only the attribute of Sattwa, and with the aid also of the other three (_viz_., instruction, meditation and Yoga), succeed in attaining to Emancipation. [^576] The man of wisdom, by understanding the Soul which presides within the body, which is divested of the attributes of birth and death, which exists in its own nature, which being uninvested with attributes requires no act of purification, and which is identical with _Brahma_, enjoys beatitude that knows no termination. The gratification that the man of wisdom obtains by restraining his mind from wandering in all directions and fixing it wholly on the Soul is such that its like cannot be attained by one through any other means. He is said to be truly conversant with the Vedas who is conversant with that which gratifies one whose stomach is empty, which pleases one who is indigent, and which invigorates one whose limbs are dry. Suspending his senses that have been duly restrained from unworthy indulgence, he who lives engaged in Yoga meditation, is said to be a Brahmana. Such a person is said to be distinguished above others. Such a person is said to derive his joys from the Soul. With reference to one who lives after having weakened desire and devoting himself to the highest topic of existence, it should be said that his happiness is continuously enhanced like the lunar disc (in the lighted fortnight). [^577] Like the <span id="p213"><sup><small>[ p. 213 ]</small></sup></span> Sun dispelling darkness, felicity dispels the sorrows of that Yogin who transcends both the gross and the subtile elements, as also _Mahat_ and the Unmanifest. [^578] Decrepitude and death cannot assail that Brahmana who has got beyond the sphere of acts, who has transcended the destruction of the _Gunas_ themselves, and who is no longer attached to worldly objects. [^579] Indeed, when the Yogin, freed from everything, lives in a state transcending both attachment and aversion, he is said to transcend even in this life his senses and all their objects. That Yogin, who having transcended Prakriti attains to the Highest Cause, becomes freed from the obligation of a return to the world in consequence of his having attained to that which is the highest.’” [^580]

“Vyasa said, ‘Unto a disciple that wishes to enquire after Emancipation after having transcended all pairs of opposites and accomplished the concerns of both profit and religion, an accomplished preceptor should first recount all that has been said in the foregoing section, which is elaborate, on the topic of _Adhyatma_. [^581] Space, wind, light, water and earth counted as the fifth, and _bhava_ and _abhava_ and time, exist in all living creatures having the five for their constituent ingredients. [^582] Space is unoccupied interval. The organs of hearing consist of space. One conversant with the science of entities endued with form should know that space has sound for its attribute. The feet (that assist at locomotion) have wind for their essence. The vital breaths are made of wind. The sense of touch (skin) has wind for its essence, and touch is the attribute of wind. Heat, the digestive fire in the stomach, light that discovers all things, the warmth that is in the body, and eye counted as the fifth, are all of light which has form of diverse colours for its attribute. Liquefied discharges, <span id="p214"><sup><small>[ p. 214 ]</small></sup></span> solubility, and all kinds of liquid matter are of water. Blood, marrow, and all else (in the body) that is cool, should be known to have water for their essence. The tongue is the sense of taste, and taste is regarded as the attribute of water. All solid substances are of earth, as also bones, teeth, nails, beard, the bristles on the body, hair, nerves, sinews, and skin. The nose is called the sense of scent. The object of that sense, _viz_., scent, should be known as the attribute of earth. Each subsequent element possesses the attribute or attributes of the preceding one besides its own.  [^583] In all living creatures again are the (three) supplementary entities (_viz_., avidya, kama, and karma). [^584] The Rishis thus declared the five elements and the effects and attributes flowing from or belonging to them. The mind forms the ninth in the calculation, and the understanding is regarded as the tenth. The Soul, which is infinite, is called the eleventh. It is regarded as this all and as the highest. The mind has doubt for its essence. The understanding discriminates and causes certainty. The Soul (which, as already said, is infinite), becomes known as _Jiva_ invested with body (or jivatman) through consequences derived from acts. [^585] That man who looketh upon the entire assemblage of living creatures to be unstained, though endued with all these entities having time for their essence, has never to recur to acts affected by error.’” [^586]

“Vyasa said, ‘There is a wonderful tree, called Desire, in the heart of a man. It is born of the seed called Error. Wrath and pride constitute its large trunk. The wish for action is the basin around its foot (for holding the water that is to nourish it). Ignorance is the root of that tree, and heedlessness is the water <span id="p217"><sup><small>[ p. 217 ]</small></sup></span> that gives it sustenance. Envy constitutes its leaves. The evil acts of past lives supply it with vigour. Loss of judgment and anxiety are its twigs; grief forms its large branches; and fear is its sprout. Thirst (after diverse objects) that is (apparently) agreeable forms the creepers that twine round it on every side. Excessively greedy men, bound in chains of iron, sitting around that fruit-yielding tree, pay their adorations to it, in expectation of obtaining its fruit. [^596] He who, subduing those chains, cutteth down that tree and seeks to cast off both sorrow and joy, succeeds in attaining to the end of both. [^597] That foolish man who nourishes this tree by indulgence in the objects of the senses is destroyed by those very objects in which he indulges after the manner of a poisonous pill destroying the patient to whom it is administered. [^598] A dexterous person, however, by the aid of Yoga, forcibly teareth up and cutteth with the sword of _samadhi_, the far-reaching root of this tree. [^599] One who knows that the end of all acts undertaken from only the desire of fruit is rebirth or chains that bind, succeeds in transcending all sorrow. The body is said to be a city. The understanding is said to be its mistress. The mind dwelling within the body is the minister of that mistress whose chief function is to decide. The senses are the citizen that are employed by the mind (upon the service of the mistress). For cherishing those citizens the mind displays a strong inclination for acts of diverse kinds. In the matter of those acts, two great faults are observable, _viz_., Tamas and Rajas. [^600] Upon the fruits of those acts rest those citizens along with the chiefs of the city (_viz_., Mind, Understanding, and Consciousness). [^601] The two faults (already spoken of) live upon the fruits of those acts that are accomplished by forbidden means. This being the case, the understanding, which of itself is unconquerable (by either Rajas or Tamas), descends to a state of equality with the mind (by becoming as much tainted as the mind that serves it). Then again the senses, agitated by <span id="p218"><sup><small>[ p. 218 ]</small></sup></span> the stained mind, lose their own stability. Those objects again for whose acquisition the understanding strives (regarding them to be beneficial) become productive of grief and ultimately Meet with destruction. Those objects, after destruction, are recollected by the mind, and accordingly they afflict the mind even after they are lost. The understanding is afflicted at the same time, for the mind is said to be different from the understanding only when the mind is considered in respect of its chief function of receiving impressions about whose certainty it is no judge. In reality, however, the mind is identical with the understanding. [^602] The Rajas (productive of only sorrow and evil of every kind) that is in the understanding then overwhelms the Soul itself that lies over the Rajas-stained understanding like an image upon a mirror. [^603] It is the mind that first unites in friendship with Rajas. Having united itself, it seizes the soul, the understanding, and the senses (like a false minister seizing the king and the citizens after having conspired with a foe) and makes them over to Rajas (with which it has united itself).’”

“Bhishma said, ‘Do thou, O son, O sinless one, listen once more, with feelings of great pride, to the words that fell from the lips of the Island-born _Rishi_ on the subject of the enumeration of the entities. Like unto a blazing fire (for having transcended all ignorance), the great _Rishi_ said these words unto his son who resembled a fire wrapped in smoke. [^604] Instructed by what he said, I also, O son, shall again expound to thee that certain knowledge (which dispels ignorance). The properties possessed by earth are immobility, weight, hardness, productiveness, scent, density, capacity to absorb scents of all kinds, cohesion, habitableness (in respect of vegetables and animals), and that attribute of the mind which is called patience of the capacity to bear. The properties of water are coolness, taste, moisture, liquidity, softness, agreeableness, tongue, fluidity, capacity to be congealed, and power to melt many earthly products. [^605] The properties of fire are irresistible energy, inflammability, heat, capacity t o soften, light, sorrow, disease, speed, fury, and invariably upward motion. The properties of the wind are touch that is neither hot nor cool, capacity to assist the organ of speech, independence <span id="p219"><sup><small>[ p. 219 ]</small></sup></span> (in respect of motion), strength, celerity, power to assist all kinds of emission or discharge, power to raise other objects, breaths inhaled and exhaled, life (as the attribute of Chit) and birth (including death). The properties of space are sound, extension, capacity of being enclosed, absence of refuge for resting upon absence of all necessity for such refuge, status of being unmanifest, capacity for modification, incapacity for producing resistance, material cause for producing the sense of hearing, and the unoccupied portions of the human body. These are the fifty properties, as declared, that constitute, the essence of the five elementary entities. [^606] Patience, reasoning or disputation, remembrance, forgetfulness or error, imagination, endurance, propensity towards good, propensity towards evil, and restlessness,—these are the properties of the mind. Destruction of both good and evil thoughts (_i.e._, dreamless slumber), perseverance, concentration, decision, and ascertainment of all things resting upon direct evidence, constitute the five properties of the understanding.’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘How can the understanding be said to have five properties? How again, can the five senses be spoken of as properties (of the five elementary entities)? Expound to me, O grandsire, all this that seems to be very abstruse.’

“Bhishma said, ‘The understanding is said to possess altogether sixty properties, for the understanding includes the five elements. [^607] All those properties exist in a state of union with the Soul. The Vedas declare, O son, that the elements, their (fifty) properties (together with the mind and the understanding and their nine and five properties) are all created by Him who is above all deterioration. These (one and seventy) entities, therefore, are not eternal (like the Soul). The theories contradicting the Revelation that have in the previous Vedas, O son, been placed before thee (about the origin of the Universe and its other incidents) are all defective in the eye of reason. Carefully attending, however, in this world to all that I have said unto thee about the Supreme _Brahma_, do thou, after attaining to the puissance that the knowledge of _Brahma_ offers, seek to win tranquillity of heart.’” [^608]

“Yudhishthira said, ‘These lords of earth that lie on the earth's surface amid their respective hosts, these princes endued with great might, are now reft of animation. Every one of these mighty monarchs was possessed of strength equal to that of ten thousand elephants. Alas! these have all been slain by men possessed of equal prowess and might. I do not behold any one else (in the world) that could slay any of these men in battle. [^609] All of them were endued with great prowess, great energy, and great strength. Possessed also of great wisdom, they are now lying on the bare ground, deprived of life. With respect to all these men that are deprived of life, the word that is used is that they are dead. Of terrible prowess, all these kings are said to be dead. On this subject a doubt has arisen in my mind. Whence is animation and whence is death? Who is it that dies? (Is it the gross body, the subtile body, or the Soul, that dies)? Whence is death? For what reason also doth death takeaway (living creatures)? O grandsire, tell me this, O thou that resemblest a celestial!’

“Bhishma said, ‘In days of old, in the Krita age, O son, there was a king of the name of Anukampaka. His cars and elephants and horses and men having been reduced in number, he was brought under the sway of his foes in battle. His son named Hari, who resembled Narayana himself in strength, was in that battle slain by his foes along with all his followers and troops. Afflicted with grief on account of the death of his son, and himself brought under the sway of foes, the king devoted himself thence to a life of tranquillity. One day, while wandering without a purpose he met the sage Narada on the earth. The monarch told Narada all that had happened, _viz_., the death of his son in battle and his own capture by his enemies. Having heard his words, Narada, possessed of wealth of penances, then recited to him the following narrative for dispelling his grief on account of the death of his son.’

“Narada said, ‘Listen now, O monarch, to the following narrative of rather lengthy details as these had occurred. I myself heard it formerly, O king! Endued with great energy, the Grandsire, at the time of the creation of the universe, created a large number of living beings. These multiplied greatly, and none of them met with death. There was no part of the universe that was not overcrowded with living creatures, O thou of unfading glory! Indeed, O king, the three worlds seemed to swell with living beings, and became as it were breathless. Then, O monarch, the thought arose in the Grandsire's mind as to how he should destroy that overgrown population. Reflecting on the subject, the Self-born, however, could not decide what the means should be by which the destruction of life was to be brought about. <span id="p221"><sup><small>[ p. 221 ]</small></sup></span> Thereupon, O king, Brahman gave way to wrath, and in consequence of his wrath a fire issued out of his body. With that fire born of his wrath, the Grandsire burnt all the quarters of the universe, O monarch. Indeed, that conflagration born of the Divine lord's anger, O king, burnt heaven and earth and the firmament and the whole universe with all its mobile and immobile beings. Truly, when the Grandsire thus gave way to wrath, all mobile and immobile beings began to be consumed by the irresistible energy of that passion. Then the divine and auspicious Sthanu, that slayer of hostile heroes, that lord of the Vedas and the scriptures, filled with compassion, sought to gratify Brahman. When Sthanu came to Brahman from motives of benevolence, the great God burning with energy, addressed him, saying, ‘Thou deservest boons at my hands. What desire of thine shall I accomplish? I shall do thee good by accomplishing whatever is in thy breast.’”


## SECTION CCLVII

“Sthanu said, ‘Know, O lord, that my solicitations to thee are on behalf of the created beings of the universe. These beings have been created by thee. Do not be angry with them, O grandsire! By the fire born of thy energy, O illustrious one, all the created beings are being consumed. Beholding them placed in such a plight, I am penetrated with compassion. Do not be angry with them, O lord of the universe.’

“The lord of all created beings said, ‘I am not angry, nor it is my wish that all the created beings should cease to exist. It is only for lightening the burthen of the earth that destruction is desirable. The goddess Earth, afflicted with the weight of creatures, solicited me, O Mahadeva, for destroying them, especially as She seemed to sink under their burthen into the water. When after exercising my intelligence for even a long while I could not hit upon the means by which to accomplish the destruction of this overgrown population, it was then that wrath took possession of my breast.’

“Sthanu said, ‘Do not give way to wrath, O lord of the deities, with respect to this matter about the destruction of living creatures. Be gratified. Let not these mobile and immobile beings be destroyed. All tanks, all kinds of grass and herbs, all immobile beings, and all mobile creatures also of the four varieties, are being consumed. The whole universe is about to be denuded of beings. Be gratified, O divine lord! O thou of righteous heart, even this is the boon that I solicit at thy hands. If destroyed, these creatures would not come back. Therefore, let this energy of thine be neutralised by thy own energy. Actuated by compassion for all created beings find some means so that, O Grandsire, these living creatures may not burn. Oh, let not these living creatures perish with even their descendants thus destroyed. Thou hast appointed me as the presider over the consciousness of all living creatures, <span id="p222"><sup><small>[ p. 222 ]</small></sup></span> O lord of all the lords of the universe. All this mobile and immobile universe of life, O lord of the universe, hath sprung from thee. Pacifying thee, O god of gods, I beg of thee that living creatures may repeatedly come back into the world, undergoing repeated deaths.’

“Narada continued, ‘Hearing these words of Sthanu, the divine Brahman of restrained speech and mind himself suppressed that energy of his within his own heart. Suppressing that fire that had been devastating the universe, the illustrious Brahman, adored of all, and possessed of illimitable puissance, then arranged for both birth and death in respect of all living creatures. After the Selfborn had withdrawn and suppressed that fire, there came out, from all the outlets of his body, a lady attired in robes of black and red, with black eyes, black palms, wearing a pair of excellent ear-rings, and adorned with celestial ornaments. Having sprung from Brahman's body, the lady took her station on his right. The two foremost of deities thereupon looked at her. Then, O king, the puissant Selfborn, the original cause of all the worlds, saluted her and said, ‘O Death, slay these creatures of the universe. Filled with anger and resolved to bring about the destruction of created beings, I have called thee. [^610] Do thou, therefore, commence to destroy all creatures foolish or learned. O lady, slay all created beings without making exception in anybody's favour. At my command thou wilt win great prosperity.‘ Thus addressed, the goddess, Death, adorned with a garland of lotuses, began to reflect sorrowfully and shed copious tears. Without allowing her tears, however, to fall down, she held them, O king, in her joined palms. She then besought the Self-born, impelled by the desire of doing good to mankind.’”


## SECTION CCLVIII

“Narada said, ‘The large-eyed lady, controlling her grief by an effort of her own, addressed the Grandsire, with joined hands and bending in an attribute of humility like a creeper. And she said, ‘How, O foremost of speakers, shall a lady like me that has sprung from thee proceed to accomplish such a terrible feat,—a feat, that is, which is sure to inspire all living creatures with dread? I fear to do aught that is iniquitous. Do thou appoint such work for me as is righteous. Thou seest that I am frightened. Oh, cast a compassionate glance upon me. I shall not be able to cut off living creatures,—infants, youths, and aged ones,—who have done me no injury. O lord of all creatures, I bow to thee, be gratified with me. I shall not be able to cut off dear sons and loved friends and brothers and mothers and fathers. If these die (through my act), their surviving relatives will surely curse me. I am filled with fear <span id="p223"><sup><small>[ p. 223 ]</small></sup></span> at the prospect of this. [^611] The tears of the sorrow-stricken survivors will burn me for eternity. I am very much afraid of them (whose relatives I shall have to cut off). I seek thy protection. All sinful creatures (slain by me) will have to sink into the infernal regions. I seek to gratify thee, O boon-giving god! Extend to me thy grace, O puissant lord! I seek the gratification of this wish, O Grandsire, of all the worlds. O foremost of all the gods, I seek, through thy grace, even this object, _viz_., permission to undergo severe austerities.’

“The Grandsire said, ‘O Death, thou hast been intended by me for the destruction of all creatures. Go, and set thyself to the task of slaying all. Do not reflect (upon the propriety or otherwise of this act). This must certainly be. It cannot be otherwise. O sinless one, O lady of faultless limbs, do thou accomplish the behest I have uttered.’ Thus addressed, O thou of Mighty arms, the lady called Death, O conqueror of hostile cities, spoke not a word, but humbly stood there with her eyes upturned towards the puissant Lord of all creatures. Brahman addressed her repeatedly, but the lady seemed to be herself deprived of life. Beholding her thus, the god of gods, that lord of lords, became silent. Indeed, the Self-born, by an effort of his will, became gratified. Smiling, the lord of all the worlds then cast his eyes on the universe. It has been heard by us that when that unconquered and illustrious lord subdued his wrath, the lady (called Death) went away from his side. Leaving Brahman's side without having promised to accomplish the destruction of living creatures, Death quickly proceeded, O king, to the sacred spot known by the name of Dhenuka. There the goddess practised the severest austerities for five and ten billions of years, all the while standing upon one foot. [^612] After she practised such exceedingly severe austerities in that place, Brahman of great energy once more said unto her, ‘Do thou accomplish my behest, O Death!’ Disregarding this command, the lady once more practised penances standing upon one foot for twenty billions of years, O giver of honours! And once more, O son, she led a life in the woods with the deer for another long period consisting of ten thousand billions of years. [^613] And once, O foremost of men, she passed twice ten thousand years, living upon air only as her sustenance. Once again, O monarch, she observed the excellent vow of silence for eight thousand years, passing the whole time in water. Then that maiden, O best of kings, went to the river Kausiki. There she began to pass her days in the observance of another vow, living the while upon only water and air. After this, O monarch, the blessed maiden proceeded to the Ganges and thence to the mountains of Meru. Moved by the desire of doing good to all living creatures, she stood perfectly motionless there like a piece of wood. Proceeding thence to the summit of Himavat where the deities had performed their great sacrifice, she stood there for <span id="p224"><sup><small>[ p. 224 ]</small></sup></span> another hundred billions of years, supporting her weight upon only the toes of her feet with the object of gratifying the Grandsire with such an act of austerity. Wending thither, the Creator and Destroyer of the universe again addressed her saying, ‘Upon what art thou engaged, O daughter? Accomplish those words of mine.’ Addressing the divine Grandsire, the maiden once more said, ‘I am unable to cut off living creatures, O god! I seek to gratify thee (so that I may be excused of this behest).’ Frightened at the prospect of demerit she prayed the Grandsire for being excused of obedience to his command, the Grandsire silenced her, and once more addressed her, saying, ‘No demerit will accrue, O Death! Do thou, O auspicious maiden, set thyself to the task of destroying living creatures. That which I have uttered, O amiable girl, cannot certainly be falsified. Eternal righteousness shall now take refuge in thee. Myself and all the deities shall always be employed in seeking thy good. This other wish that is in thy heart I grant thee. Living creatures shall be afflicted by disease, and (dying) shall cast the blame on thee. Thou shalt become a male in all male beings, a female in all female beings, and a eunuch in all those that are of the third sex. [^614] Thus addressed by Brahman, O king, the maiden at last said, with joined hands unto that high-souled and undeteriorating lord of all the deities, these words, ‘I am unable to obey thy command.’ The great God, without relenting, again, said unto her, ‘O Death, do thou kill men. I shall so ordain that thou shalt not incur any demerit by doing this, O auspicious lady! Those tear drops that I see fallen from thy eyes, and that thou still boldest in thy joined hands, shall take the form of terrible diseases and even they shall destroy men when their hours come. When the end comes of living creatures, thou shalt despatch Desire and Wrath together against them. Immeasurable merit shall be thine. Thou shalt not incur iniquity, being thyself perfectly equal in thy behaviour. [^615] By doing this thou wilt only observe righteousness instead of sinking thyself into iniquity. Do thou, therefore, set thy heart upon the task at hand, and addressing Desire and Wrath begin to slay all living creatures.’ Thus addressed, that lady, called by the name of Death, became afraid of Brahman's curse and answered him, saying, ‘Yes!’ From that time she began to despatch Desire and Wrath as the last hours of living creatures and through their agency to put a stop to their life-breaths. Those tears that Death had shed are the diseases by which the bodies of men become afflicted. At the destruction, therefore, of living creatures, one should not, understanding, with the aid of the intelligence (to what cause such destruction is due), give way to grief. As the senses of all creatures disappear when the latter become plunged into dreamless sleep and return once more when they awake, after the same manner all human beings, upon the dissolution of their bodies, have to go into the other world and return thence to this, O lion among kings! The element called wind, that is endued with terrible energy and mighty prowess <span id="p225"><sup><small>[ p. 225 ]</small></sup></span> and deafening roars, operates as the life in all living creatures. That wind, when the bodies of living creatures are destroyed, escaping from the old becomes engaged in diverse functions in diverse new bodies. For this reason, the wind is called the lord of the senses and is distinguished above the other elements constituting the gross body. The gods, without exception, (when their merits cease), have to take birth as mortal creatures on earth. Similarly, all mortal creatures also (when they acquire sufficient merit), succeed in attaining to the status of gods. Therefore, O lion among kings, do not grieve for thy son. Thy son has attained to heaven and is enjoying great happiness there! It was thus, O monarch, that Death was created by the Self-born and it is in this way that she cuts off duly all living creatures when their hours come. The tears she had shed become diseases, which, when their last hours come, snatch away all beings endued with life.’”


## SECTION CCLIX

“Yudhishthira said, ‘All men that inhabit this earth are filled with doubts in respect of the nature of righteousness. Who is this that is called Righteousness? Whence also does Righteousness come? Tell me this, O Grandsire! Is Righteousness for service in this world or is it for service in the next world? Or, is it for service both here and hereafter? Tell me this, O grandsire!’

“Bhishma said, ‘The practices of the good, the _Smritis_, and the Vedas, are the three indications (sources) of righteousness. Besides these, the learned have declared that the purpose (for which an act is accomplished) is the fourth indication of righteousness. [^616] The _Rishis_ of old have declared what acts are righteous and also classified them as superior or inferior in point of merit. The rules of righteousness have been laid down for the conduct of the affairs of the world. In both the worlds, that is, here and hereafter, righteousness produces happiness as its fruits. A sinful person unable to acquire merit by subtile ways, becomes stained with sin only. Some are of opinion that sinful persons can never be cleansed of their sins. In seasons of distress, a person by even speaking an untruth acquires the merit of speaking the truth, even as a person who accomplishes an unrighteous act acquires by that very means the merit of having done a righteous act. Conduct is the refuge of righteousness. Thou shouldst know what righteousness is, aided by conduct. [^617] (It is the <span id="p226"><sup><small>[ p. 226 ]</small></sup></span> nature of man that he neither sees nor proclaims his own faults but notices and proclaims those of others). The very thief, stealing what belongs to others, spends the produce of his theft in acts of apparent virtue. During a time of anarchy, the thief takes great pleasure in appropriating what belongs to others. When others, however, rob him of what he has acquired by robbery, he then wishes forthwith for a Icing (for invoking punishment on the head of the offenders). At even such a time, when his indignation for offended rights of property is at its highest, he secretly covets the wealth of those that are contended with their own. Fearlessly and without a doubt in his mind (when he is himself the victim of a robbery) he repairs to the king's palace with a mind cleansed of every sin. Within even his own heart he does not see the stain of any evil act. [^618] To speak the truth is meritorious. There is nothing higher than truth. Everything is upheld by truth, and everything rests upon truth. Even the sinful and ferocious, swearing to keep the truth amongst themselves, dismiss all grounds of quarrel and uniting with one another set themselves to their (sinful) tasks, depending upon truth. If they behaved falsely towards one another, they would then be destroyed without doubt. One should not take what belongs to others. That is an eternal obligation. Powerful men regard it as one that has been introduced by the weak. When, however, the destiny of these men becomes adverse, this injunction then meets with their approval. Then again they that surpass others in strength or prowess do not necessarily become happy. [^619] Therefore, do not ever set thy heart on any act that is wrong. One behaving in this way hath no fear of dishonest men or thieves or the king. Not having done any injury to any one, such a man lives fearlessly and with a pure heart. A thief fears everybody, like a deer driven from the woods into the midst of an inhabited village. He thinks other people to be as sinful as himself. One that is of pure heart is always filled with cheerfulness and hath no fear from any direction. Such a person never sees his own misconduct in others. [^620] Persons engaged in doing good to all creatures have said that the practice of charity is another high duty. They that are possessed of wealth think that this duty has been laid down by those that are indigent. When, however, those wealthy men meet with poverty in consequence of some turn of fortune, the practice of charity then recommends itself to them. Men that are <span id="p227"><sup><small>[ p. 227 ]</small></sup></span> exceedingly wealthy do not necessarily meet with happiness. [^621] Knowing how painful it is to himself, a person should never do that to others which he dislikes when done to him by others. [^622] What can one who becomes the lover of another man's wife say to another man (guilty of the same transgression)? it is seen, however, that even such a one, when he sees his lady with another lover, becomes unable to forgive the act. [^623] How can one who, to draw breath himself think of preventing another by a murderous act, from doing the same? Whatever wishes one entertains with respect to one's ownself, one should certainly cherish with respect to another. With the surplus wealth one may happen to own one should relieve the wants of the indigent. It is for this reason that the Creator ordained the practice of increasing one's wealth (by trade or laying it out at interest). [^624] One should walk alone that path by proceeding along which one may hope to meet with the deities; or, at such times when wealth is gained, adherence to the duties of sacrifice and gift is laudable.  [^625] The sages have said that the accomplishment of the objects by means of agreeable (pacific) means is righteousness. See, O Yudhishthira, that even this is the criterion that has been kept in view in declaring the indications of righteousness and iniquity. [^626] In days of old the Creator ordained righteousness endowing it with the power of holding the world together. The conduct of the good, that is fraught with excellence, is subjected to (numerous) restraints for acquiring righteousness which depends upon many delicate considerations. The indications of righteousness have now been recounted to thee, O foremost one of Kuru's race! Do not, therefore, at any time set thy understanding upon any act that is wrong.’”

It seems to me, however, that I have a certain inward light in consequence of which I can discriminate between <span id="p228"><sup><small>[ p. 228 ]</small></sup></span> right and wrong by inferences. [^627] Numerous questions that I had intended to ask thee have all been answered by thee. There is one question, however, that I shall presently ask. It is not prompted, O king, by desire of empty disputation. All these embodied creatures, it seems, take birth, exist, and leave their bodies, of their own nature. Duty and its reverse, therefore, cannot be ascertained, O Bharata, by study of the scriptures alone. [^628] The duties of a person who is well off are of one kind. Those of a person who has fallen into distress are of another kind. How can duty respecting seasons of distress be ascertained by reading the scriptures alone? [^629] The acts of the good, thou hast said, constitute righteousness (or duty). The good, however, are to be ascertained by their acts. The definition, therefore, has for its foundation, a begging of the question, with the result that what is meant by conduct of the good remains unsettled. It is seen that some ordinary person commits unrighteousness while apparently achieving righteousness. Some extraordinary persons again may be seen who achieve righteousness by committing acts that are apparently unrighteous. [^630] Then, again, the proof (of what I say) has been furnished by even those that are well conversant with the scriptures themselves, for it has been heard by us that the ordinances of the Vedas disappear gradually in every successive age. The duties in the Krita age are of one kind. Those in the Treta are of another kind, and those in the Dwapara are again different. The duties in the Kali age, again, are entirely of another kind. It seems, therefore, that duties have been laid down for the respective ages according to the powers of human beings in the respective ages. When, therefore, all the declarations in the Vedas do not apply equally to all the ages, the saying that the declarations of the Vedas are true is only a popular form of speech indulged in for popular satisfaction. From the _Srutis_ have originated the _Smritis_ whose scope again is very wide. If the Vedas be authority for everything, then authority would attach to the _Smritis_ also for the latter are <span id="p229"><sup><small>[ p. 229 ]</small></sup></span> based on the former. When, however, the _Srutis_ and the _Smritis_ contradict each other, how can either be authoritative? Then again, it is seen that when some wicked persons of great might cause certain portions of certain courses of righteous acts to be stopped, these are destroyed for ever. [^631] Whether we know it or know it not, whether we are able to ascertain it or not to ascertain it, the course of duty is finer than the edge of a razor and grosser than even a mountain. Righteousness (in the form of sacrifices and other religious acts) at first appears in the form of the romantic edifices of vapour seen in the distant sky. When, however, it is examined by the learned, it disappears and becomes invisible. [^632] Like the small ponds at which the cattle drink or the shallow aqueducts along cultivated fields that dry up very soon, the eternal practices inculcated in the _Smritis_, falling into discontinuance, at last disappear totally (in the Kali age). Amongst men that are not good some are seen to become hypocrites (in respect of the acquisition of righteousness) by suffering themselves to be urged by desire. Some become so, urged by the wishes of others. Others, numbering many, tread in the same path, influenced by diverse other motives of a similar character. [^633] It cannot be denied that such acts (though accomplished by persons under the influence of evil passions) are righteous. Fools, again, say that righteousness is an empty sound among those called good. They ridicule such persons and regard them as men destitute of reason. Many great men, again, turning back (from the duties of their own order) betake themselves to the duties of the kingly order. No such conduct, therefore, is to be seen (as observed by any man), which is fraught with universal benevolence. [^634] By a certain course of conduct one becomes really meritorious. That very course of conduct obstructs another in the acquisition of merit. Another, by practising at his pleasure that conduct, it is seen, remains unchanged. [^635] Thus that conduct by which one becomes meritorious impedes another in the acquisition of merit. One may thus see <span id="p230"><sup><small>[ p. 230 ]</small></sup></span> that all courses of conduct are seen to lose singleness of purpose and character. It seems, therefore, that only that which the learned of ancient times called righteousness is righteousness to this day: and through that course of conduct (which the learned so settled) the distinctions and limitations (that govern the world) have become eternal.’” [^636]

“Bhishma said, 

“Yudhishthira said, ‘What, O sire, are those difficult feats that Jajali had performed before in consequence of which he had acquired such high success? It behoveth thee to describe them to me.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Jajali had become engaged in penances of the severest austerities. He used to perform ablutions morning and evening. Carefully tending his fires, he was devoted to the study of the Vedas. Well-conversant with the duties laid down for forest recluses, Jajali (in consequence of his practices) seemed to blaze with effulgence. [^639] He continued to live in the woods, engaged all the while in penances. But he never regarded himself as one that had acquired any merit by his acts. In the season of the rains he slept under the open sky. In autumn he sat in water. In summer he exposed himself to the sun and the wind. Still he never regarded himself as one that had acquired any merit through such acts. He used to sleep on diverse kinds of painful beds and also on the bare earth. Once on a time, that ascetic, while standing under the sky in the rainy season, received on his head repeated downpours from the clouds. He had to pass through the woods repeatedly. What with exposure to the rains and what with the filth they caught, the locks of that sinless _Rishi_ became entangled and intertwined with one another. On one occasion, that great ascetic, abstaining entirely from food and living upon air only, stood in the forest like a post of wood. Unmoved at heart, he stood there, without once stirring an inch. While he stood there like a wooden post, perfectly immovable, O Bharata, a pair of Kulinga birds, O king, built their nest on his head. Filled with compassion, the great _Rishi_ suffered that feathery couple in building their nest among his matted locks with shreds of grass. And as the ascetic stood there like a post of wood, the two birds lived with confidence on his head happily. The rains passed away and autumn came. The couple, urged by desire, approached each other according to the law of the Creator, and in complete confidence laid their eggs, O king, on the head of that _Rishi_. Of rigid vows and possessed of energy, the ascetic knew it. Knowing what the birds had done, Jajali moved not. Firmly resolved to acquire merit, no act that involved the slightest injury to others could recommend itself to him. The feathery couple going away and moving every day from and to his head, happily and confidently lived there, O puissant king! When in the progress of time the eggs became mature and young ones came out, they began to grow up in that nest, for Jajali moved not in the least. Firm in the observance of his vows, the righteous-souled _Rishi_ continued to hold and protect those eggs by standing on that very spot perfectly motionless and rapt in Yoga meditation. In course of time the young ones grew and became equipped with wings. The _Muni_ knew that the young _Kulingas_ had attained to that stage of development. That foremost of intelligent men, steady in the observance of vows, one day beheld those <span id="p232"><sup><small>[ p. 232 ]</small></sup></span> young ones and became filled with pleasure. The parent-birds, seeing their young ones equipped with wings, became very happy and continued to dwell in the _Rishi's_ head with them in perfect safety. The learned Jajali saw that when the young birds became equipped with wings they took to the air every evening and returned to his head without having proceeded far. He still stood motionless on that spot. Sometimes, after he saw that, left by their parents, they went out by themselves and returned again by themselves. Jajali still moved not. A little while after, the young birds going away in the morning passed the whole day out of his sight, but came back in the evening for dwelling in the nest. Sometimes, after that, leaving their nest for five days at a stretch, they returned on the sixth day. Jajali still moved not. Subsequently, when their strength became fully developed they left him and returned not at all even after many days. At last, on one occasion, leaving him, they came not even after a month. Then, O king, Jajali left that spot. When they had thus gone away for good, Jajali wondered much, and thought that he had achieved ascetic success. Then pride entered his heart. Firm in the observance of vows, the great ascetic, seeing the birds thus leave him after having been reared on his head, thought highly of himself, and became filled with delight. He, then, bathed in a stream and poured libations on the sacred fire, and paid his adorations to the rising Sun indeed, having thus caused those _chataka_ birds to grow on his head, Jajali, that foremost of ascetics, began to slap his armpits and proclaim loudly through the sky, ‘_I have won great merit_.’ Then an invisible voice arose in the sky and Jajali heard these words, ‘Thou art not equal, O Jajali, to Tuladhara in point of righteousness. Possessed of great wisdom, that Tuladhara lives at Baranasi. Even he is not fit to say what thou sayest, O regenerate one.’ Hearing these words, Jajali became filled with wrath, and desirous of meeting Tuladhara, O monarch, began to roam over the whole earth, observing the vow of silence and passing the night at that spot where evening overtook him. [^640] After a considerable time he reached the city of Baranasi, and saw Tuladhara engaged in selling miscellaneous articles. [^641] As soon as the shop-keeper Tuladhara beheld the Brahmana arrived at his place, he cheerfully stood up and worshipped the guest with proper salutations. [^642]

“Tuladhara said, ‘Without doubt, O Brahmana, it is known to me that thou hast come to _me_. Listen, however, O foremost of regenerate persons, to what I say. Living on a low land near the sea-shore thou underwentest very austere penances. But thou hadst no consciousness of having achieved righteousness or merit. When thou didst at last attain to ascetic success, certain birds were born on thy head. Thou tookest great care of the little creatures. When at last those birds became equipped with wings and when they began to leave thy head for going hither and thither in search of food, <span id="p233"><sup><small>[ p. 233 ]</small></sup></span> it was then that, in consequence of having thus assisted at the birth of those _Chatakas_, thou begannest to feel the impulse of pride, O Brahmana, thinking thou hadst achieved great merit. [^643] Then, O foremost of regenerate persons, thou heardest in the sky a voice that referred to me. The words thou didst hear filled thee with wrath, and as the consequence thereof thou art here. Tell me, what wish of thine I shall accomplish, O best of Brahmanas!’”


## SECTION CCLXII

“Bhishma said, ‘Thus addressed by the intelligent Tuladhara on that occasion, Jajali of great intelligence, that foremost of ascetics, said these words unto him.’

“Jajali said, ‘Thou sellest all kinds of juices and scents, O son of a trader, as also (barks and leaves of) large trees and herbs and their fruits and roots. "How hast thou succeeded in acquiring a certitude or stability of understanding? Whence hath this knowledge come to thee? O thou of great intelligence, tell me all this in detail.’

“Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by that Brahmana possessed of I great fame, Tuladhara of the Vaisya order, well-acquainted with the truths touching the interpretations of morality and contented with knowledge, discoursed to Jajali who had undergone severe penances, upon the ways of morality. [^644]

“Tuladhara said, 'O Jajali, I know morality, which is eternal, with all its mysteries. It is nothing else than that ancient morality which is known to all, and which consists of universal friendliness, and is fraught with beneficence to all creatures. [^645] That mode of living which is founded upon a total harmlessness towards all creatures or (in case of actual necessity) upon a minimum of such harm, is the highest morality. I live according to that mode, O Jajali! This my house hath been built with wood and grass cut by other people's hands. Lac dye, the roots of Nymphaea lotus, filaments of the lotus, diverse kinds of good scents [^646] and many kinds of liquids, O regenerate <span id="p234"><sup><small>[ p. 234 ]</small></sup></span> _Rishi_, with the exception of wines, I purchase from other people's hand and sell without cheating. He, O Jajali, is said to know what morality or righteousness is, who is always the friend of all creatures and who is always engaged in the good of all creatures, in thought, word, and deed. I never solicit any one. I never quarrel with any one, I never cherish aversion for any one. I never cherish desire for anything. I cast equal eyes upon all things and all creatures. Behold, O Jajali, this is my vow! My scales are perfectly even, O Jajali, with respect to all creatures. [^647] I neither praise nor blame the acts of others, viewing this variety in the world, O foremost of Brahmanas, to be like the variety observable in the sky. [^648] Know, O Jajali, that I cast equal eye upon all creatures. O foremost of intelligent men, I see no difference between a clod of earth a piece of stone, and a lump of gold. As the blind, the deaf, and they that are destitute of reason, are perfectly consoled for the loss of their senses, after the same manner am I consoled, by their example (for the enjoyments I abstain from). [^649] As they that are overtaken by decrepitude, they that are afflicted by disease, and they that are weakened and emaciated, have no relish for enjoyments of any kind, after the same manner have I ceased to feel any relish for wealth or pleasure or enjoyments. When a person fears nothing and himself is not feared, when he cherishes no desire and hath no aversion for anything, he is then said to attain to _Brahma_. When a person does not conduct himself sinfully towards any creature in thought, word, or deed, then is he said to attain to _Brahma_. There is no past, no future. There is no morality or righteousness. He who is not an object of fear with any creature succeeds in attaining to a state in which there is no fear. [^650] On the other hand, that person who for harshness of speech and severity of temper, is a source of trouble unto all creatures even as death itself, certainly attains to a state which abounds with fear. I follow the practices of high-souled and benevolent men of advanced years who with their children and children's children live in the due observance of the ordinance laid down in the scriptures. [^651] The eternal practices (laid down in the Vedas) are entirely given up by one who suffers himself to be stupefied by some errors that he may have noticed in the conduct of those that are admittedly good and wise. One, however, that is endued with learning, or one that has subdued one's senses, or one that is <span id="p235"><sup><small>[ p. 235 ]</small></sup></span> possessed of strength of mind, succeeds in attaining to Emancipation, guided by that very conduct. [^652] That wise man who, having restrained his senses, practiseth, with a heart cleansed from all desire of injuring others, the conduct that is followed by those called good, is sure, O Jajali, to acquire the merit of righteousness (and Emancipation which is its fruits). In this world, as in a river, a piece of wood that is being borne away by the current as it pleases, is seen to come into contact (for some time) with another piece that is being similarly borne away. There, on the current, other pieces of wood that had been joined together, are seen again to separate from one another. Grass, sticks, and cowdung cakes are seen to be united together. This union is due to accident and not to purpose or design. [^653] He of whom no creature is frightened in the least is himself, O ascetic, never frightened by any creature. He, on the other hand, O learned man, of whom every creature is frightened as of a wolf, becomes himself filled with fear as aquatic animals when forced to leap on the shore from fear of the roaring _Vadava_ fire. [^654] This practice of universal harmlessness hath arisen even thus. One may follow it by every means in one's power. He who has followers and he who has wealth may seek to adopt it. It is sure to lead also to prosperity and heaven. [^655] Inconsequence of their ability to dispel the fears of others, men possessed of wealth and followers are regarded as foremost by the learned. They that are for ordinary happiness practise this duty of universal harmlessness for the sake of fame; while they that are truly skilled, practise the same for the sake of attaining to _Brahma_. [^656] Whatever fruits one enjoys by penances, by sacrifices, by practising liberality, by speaking the truth, and by paying court to wisdom, may all be had by practising the duty of harmlessness. That person who gives unto all creatures the assurance of harmlessness obtains the merit of all sacrifices and at last wins fearlessness for himself as his reward. There is no duty superior to the duty of <span id="p236"><sup><small>[ p. 236 ]</small></sup></span> abstention from injuring other creatures. He of whom, O great ascetic, no creature is frightened in the least, obtains for himself fearlessness of all creatures. He of whom everybody is frightened as one is of a snake ensconced within one's (sleeping) chamber, never acquires any merit in this world or in the next. The very gods, in their search after it, become stupefied in the track of that person who transcends all states, the person, _viz_., who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures and who looketh upon all creatures as identical with his own self. [^657] Of all gifts, the assurance of harmlessness to all creatures is the highest (in point of merit). I tell thee truly, believe me, O Jajali! One who betakes himself to acts at first wins prosperity, but then (upon the exhaustion of his merit) he once more encounters adversity. Beholding the destruction of (the merits of) acts, the wise do not applaud acts. There is no duty, O Jajali, that is not prompted by some motive (of happiness). Duty, however, is very subtile. Duties have been laid down in the Vedas for the sake of both _Brahma_ and heaven. [^658] The subject of duties hath many secrets and mysteries. It is so subtile that it is not easy to understand it fully. Amongst diverse conflicting ordinances, some succeed in comprehending duty by observing the acts of the good. [^659] Why dost thou not consume them that emasculate bulls and bore their noses and cause them to bear heavy burthens and bind them and put them under diverse kinds of restraint, and that eat the flesh of living creatures after slaying them? Men are seen to own men as slaves, and by beating, by binding, and by otherwise subjecting them to restraints, cause them to labour day and night. These people are not ignorant of the pain that results from beating and fastening in chains. [^660] In every creature that is endued with the five senses live all the deities. Surya, Chandramas, the god of wind, Brahman, Prana, Kratu, and Yama (these dwell in living creatures), There are men that live by trafficking in living creatures! When they earn a living by such a sinful course, what scruples need they feel in selling dead carcases? The goat is Agni. The sheep is Varuna. The horse is Surya. Earth is the deity Virat. The cow and the calf are Soma. The man who sells these can never obtain success. But what fault can attach to the sale of oil, or of Ghrita, or honey, or drugs, O regenerate one? There are many animals that grow up in ease and comfort in places free from gnats and biting insects. Knowing that they are loved <span id="p237"><sup><small>[ p. 237 ]</small></sup></span> dearly by their mothers, men persecute them in diverse ways, and lead them into miry spots abounding with biting insects. Many draft animals are oppressed with heavy burthens. Others, again, are made to languish in consequence of treatment not sanctioned by the scriptures. I think that such acts of injury done to animals are in no way distinguished from foeticide. People regard the profession of agriculture to be sinless. That profession, however, is certainly fraught with cruelty. The iron-faced plough wounds the soil and many creatures that live in the soil. Cast thy eyes, O Jajali, on those bullocks yoked to the plough. Kine are called in the Srutis the Unslayable. That man perpetrates a great sin who slays a bull or a cow. [^661] In days of yore, many Rishis with restrained senses addressed Nahusha, saying, 'Thou hast, O king, slain a cow which is declared in the scriptures to be like unto one's mother. Thou hast also slain a bull, which is declared to be like unto the Creator himself. [^662] Thou hast perpetrated an evil act, O Nahusha, and we have been exceedingly pained at it.' For cleansing Nahusha, however, they divided that sin into a hundred and one parts and converting the fragments into diseases cast them among all creatures. [^663] Thus, O Jajali, did those highly-blessed _Rishis_ cast that sin on all living creatures, and addressing Nahusha who had been guilty of foeticide, said, ‘We shall not be able to pour libations in thy sacrifice.’ Thus said those high-souled _Rishis_ and Yatis conversant with the truths of all things, having ascertained by their ascetic power that king Nahusha had not been intentionally guilty of that sin. [^664] These, O Jajali, are some of the wicked and dreadful practices that are current in this world. Thou practisest them because they are practised by all men from ancient times, and not because they agree with the dictates of thy cleansed understanding. One should practise what one considers to be one's duty, guided by reasons, instead of blindly following the practices of the world. Listen now, O Jajali, as to what my behaviour is towards him that injures and him that praises me. I regard both of them in the same light. I have none whom I like and none whom I dislike. The wise applauded such a course of conduct as consistent with duty or religion. Even this course of conduct, which is consistent with reasons, is followed by Yatis. The righteous always observe it with eyes possessed of improved vision.'"

“Jajali said, ‘This course of duty that thou, O holder of scales, preachest, closes the door of heaven against all creatures and puts a stop to the very means of their subsistence. From agriculture comes food. That food offers subsistence even to thee. With the aid of animals and of crops and herbs, human beings, O trader, are enabled to support their existence. From animals and food sacrifices flow. Thy doctrines smack of atheism. This world will come to an end if the means by which life is supported have to be abandoned.’

“Tuladhara said,  [^682]

<span id="p242"><sup><small>[ p. 242 ]</small></sup></span>

“Jajali said, ‘We had never before, O son of a trader, heard of these recondite doctrines of ascetics that perform only mental Sacrifices. These doctrines are exceedingly difficult of comprehension. It is for this reason that I ask thee (about them). The sages of olden days were not followers of those doctrines of Yoga. Hence, the sages that have succeeded them have not propounded them (for general acceptance). [^683] If thou sayest that only men of brutish minds fail to achieve sacrifices in the soil of the Soul, then, O son of a trader, by what acts would they succeed in accomplishing their happiness? Tell me this, O thou of great wisdom! Great is my faith in thy words.’ [^684]

“Tuladhara said, ‘Sometimes sacrifices performed by some persons do not become sacrifices (in consequence of the absence of faith of those that perform them). These men, it should be said, are not worthy of performing any sacrifice (internal or external). As regards the faithful, however, only one thing, _viz_., the cow, is fit for upholding all sacrifices by means of full libations of clarified butter, milk, and curds, the hair at end of her tail, her horns, and her hoofs. [^685] (The Vedas declare that sacrifices cannot be performed by an unmarried man). In performing sacrifices, however, according to the mode I have pointed out (_viz_., by abstaining from slaughter of animals and dedicating only clarified butter, etc.), one may make Faith one's wedded wife, for dedicating such (innocent) offerings to the deities. By duly reverencing such sacrifices, one is sure to attain to _Brahma_. [^686] To the exclusion of all animals (which are certainly unclean as offering in sacrifices), the rice-ball is a worthy offering in sacrifices. All rivers are as sacred as the Saraswati, and all mountains are sacred. O Jajali, the Soul is itself a _Tirtha_. Do not wander about on the earth for visiting sacred places. A person, by observing these duties (that I have spoken of and that do not involve injury to other <span id="p243"><sup><small>[ p. 243 ]</small></sup></span> creatures), and by seeking the acquisition of merit agreeably to his own ability, certainly succeeds in obtaining blessed regions hereafter.’ [^687]

“Bhishma continued, ‘These are the duties, O Yudhishthira, which Tuladhara applauded,—duties that are consistent with reason, and that are always observed by those that are good and wise.’”

## SECTION CCLXIV

“Tuladhara said, ‘See with thy own eyes, O Jajali, who, _viz_., those that are good or those that are otherwise, have adopted this path of duty that I have spoken of. Thou shalt then understand properly how the truth stands. Behold, many birds are hovering in the sky. Amongst them are those that were reared on thy head, as also many hawks and many others of other species. Behold, O Brahmana, those birds have contracted their wings and legs for entering their respective nests. Summon them, O regenerate one! There those birds, treated with affection by thee, are displaying their love for thee that art their father. Without doubt, thou art their father, O Jajali! Do thou summon thy children.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Then those birds, summoned by Jajali, made answer agreeably to the dictates of that religion which is not fraught with injury to any creature. [^688] All acts that are done without injuring any creature become serviceable (to the doer) both here and hereafter. Those acts, however, that involve injury to others, destroy faith, and faith being destroyed, involves the destroyer in ruin. The sacrifices of those that regard acquisition and non-acquisition in the same light, that are endued with faith that are self-restrained, that have tranquil minds, and that perform sacrifices from a sense of duty (and not from desire of fruit), become productive of fruit. [^689] Faith with respect to Brahma is the daughter of Surya, O regenerate one. She is the protectress and she is the giver of good birth. Faith is superior to the merit born of (Vedic) recitations and meditation. [^690] An act vitiated by defect of speech is saved by Faith. An act vitiated by defect of mind is saved by Faith. But <span id="p244"><sup><small>[ p. 244 ]</small></sup></span> neither speech nor mind can save an act that is vitiated by want of Faith. [^691] Men conversant with the occurrences of the past recite in this connection the following verse sung by Brahman. The offerings in sacrifices of a person that is pure (in body and acts) but wanting in Faith, and of another that is impure (in respect of their worthiness of acceptance). The food, again, of a person conversant with the Vedas but miserly in behaviour, and that of a usurer that is liberal in conduct, [^692] the deities after careful consideration, had held to be equal (in respect of their worthiness of acceptance). The’ Supreme Lord of all creatures (_viz_., Brahman) then told them that they had committed an error. The food of a liberal person is sanctified by Faith. The food, however, of the person that is void of Faith is lost in consequence of such want of Faith. The food of a liberal usurer is acceptable but not the food of a miser. [^693] Only one person in the world, _viz_., he that is bereft of Faith, is unfit to make offerings to the deities. The food of only such a man is unfit to be eaten. This is the opinion of men conversant with duties. Want of Faith is a high sin. Faith is a cleanser of sins. Like a snake casting off its slough, the man of Faith succeeds in casting off all his sin. The religion of abstention with Faith is superior to all things considered sacred. Abstaining from all faults of behaviour, he who betakes himself to Faith, becomes sanctified. What need hath such a person of penances, or of conduct, or of endurance? Every man has Faith. Faith, however, is of three kinds, _viz_., as affected by Sattwa, by Rajas and by Tamas, and according to the kind of Faith that one has, one is named. Persons endued with goodness and possessed of insight into the true import of morality have thus laid down the subject of duties. We have, as the result of our enquiries, got all this from the sage Dharmadarsana. O thou of great wisdom, betake thyself to Faith, for thou shalt then obtain that which is superior. He who has Faith (in the declarations of the _Srutis_), and who acts according to their import (in the belief that they are good for him), is certainly of righteous soul. O Jajali, he who adheres to his own path (under the influence of Faith) is certainly a superior person.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘After a short while, Tuladhara and Jajali, both of whom had been endued with great wisdom, ascended to heaven and sported <span id="p245"><sup><small>[ p. 245 ]</small></sup></span> there in great happiness, [^694] having reached their respective places earned by their respective acts. Many truths of this kind were spoken of by Tuladhara. That eminent person understood this religion (of abstention from injury) completely. These eternal duties were accordingly proclaimed by him. The regenerate Jajali, O son of Kunti, having heard these words of celebrated energy, betook himself to tranquillity. In this way, many truths of grave import were uttered by Tuladhara, illustrated by examples for instruction. What other truths dost thou wish to hear?’”


## SECTION CCLXV

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited an old narrative of what was recited by king Vichakhy through compassion for all creatures. Beholding the mangled body of a bull, and hearing the exceedingly painful groans of the kine in a cow-slaying sacrifice, and observing the cruel Brahmanas that gathered there for assisting at the ceremonies, that king [^695] uttered these words, ‘Prosperity to all the kine in the world.’ When the slaughter had commenced, these words expressive of a blessing (to those helpless animals) were pronounced. And the monarch further said, ‘Only those that are transgressors of defined limits, that are destitute of intelligence, that are atheists and sceptics, and that desire the acquisition of celebrity through sacrifices and religious rites speak highly of the slaughter of animals in sacrifices. [^696] The righteous-souled Manu has applauded (the observance of) harmlessness in all (religious) acts. Indeed, men slaughter animals in sacrifices, urged by only the desire of fruit. [^697] Hence, guided by authority (in respect of slaughter and abstention from slaughter or harmlessness) one conversant (with the scriptures) should practise the true course of duty which is exceedingly subtile. Harmlessness to all creatures is the highest of all duties. Living in the vicinity of an inhabited place and injuring oneself to the observance of rigid vows, and disregarding the fruits indicated of Vedic acts, one should give up domesticity, adopting a life of Renunciation. Only they that are mean are urged by the desire of <span id="p246"><sup><small>[ p. 246 ]</small></sup></span> fruit. [^698] Reverentially mentioning sacrifices and trees and sacrificial stakes, men do not eat tainted meat. This practice, however, is not worthy of applause. [^699] Wine, fish, honey, meat, alcohol, and preparations of rice and sesame seeds, have been introduced by knaves. The use of these (in sacrifices) is not laid down in the Vedas. The hankering after these arises from pride, error of judgment, and cupidity. They that are true Brahmanas realise the presence of Vishnu in every sacrifice. His worship, it has been laid down, should be made with agreeable Payasa. (The leaves and flowers of) such trees as have been indicated in the Vedas, whatever act is regarded as worthy and whatever else is held as pure by persons of pure hearts and cleansed natures and those eminent for knowledge and holiness, are all worthy of being offered to the Supreme Deity and not unworthy of His acceptance.’ [^700]

“Yudhishthira said, ‘The body and all sorts of dangers and calamities are continually at war with each other. How, therefore, will a person who is totally free from the desire of harming and who on this account will not be able to act, succeed in keeping up his body?’ [^701]

“Bhishma said, ‘One should, when able, acquire merit and act in such a way that one's body may not languish and suffer pain, and that death may not come.’” [^702]

“Yudhishthira said, 'Thou, O grandsire, art our highest preceptor in the matter of all acts that are difficult of accomplishment (in consequence of the commands of superiors on the one hand and the cruelty that is involved in them on the other). I ask, how should one judge of an act in respect of either <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> one's obligation to do it or of abstaining from it? Is it to be judged speedily or with delay?'

“Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story of what occurred with respect to Chirakarin born in the race of Angirasa. Twice blessed be the man that reflects long before he acts. One that reflects long before he acts is certainly possessed of great intelligence. Such a man never offends in respect of any act. There was once a man of great wisdom, of the name of Chirakarin, who was the son of Gautama. Reflecting for a long time upon every consideration connected with proposed acts, he used to do all he had to do. He came to be called by the name of Chirakarin because he used to reflect long upon all matters, to remain awake for a long time, to sleep for a long time, and to take a long time in setting himself to the accomplishment of such acts as he accomplished. The clamour of being an idle man stuck to him. He was also regarded as a foolish person, by every person of a light understanding and destitute of foresight. On a certain occasion, witnessing an act of great fault in his wife, the sire Gautama passing over his other children, commanded in wrath this Chirakarin, saying, ‘Slay thou this woman.’ Having said these words without much reflection, the learned Gautama, that foremost of persons engaged in the practice of Yoga, that highly blessed ascetic, departed for the woods. Having after a long while assented to it, saying, ‘So be it,’ Chirakarin, in consequence of his very nature, and owing to his habit of never accomplishing any act without long reflection, began to think for a long while (upon the propriety or otherwise of what he was commanded by his sire to do). How shall I obey the command of my sire and yet how avoid slaying my mother? How shall I avoid sinking, like a wicked person, into sin in this situation in which contradictory obligations are dragging me into opposite directions? Obedience to the commands of the sire constitutes the highest merit. The protection of the mother again is a clear duty. The status of a son is fraught with dependence. How shall I avoid being afflicted by sin? Who is there that can be happy after having slain a woman, especially his mother? Who again can obtain prosperity and fame by disregarding his own sire? Regard for the sire's behest is obligatory. The protection of my mother is equally a duty. How shall I so frame my conduct that both obligations may be discharged? The father places his own self within the mother's womb and takes birth as the son, for continuing his practices, conduct, name and race. I have been begotten as a son by both my mother and my father. Knowing as I do my own origin, why should I not have this knowledge (of my relationship with both of them)? The words uttered by the sire while performing the initial rite after birth, and those that were uttered by him on the occasion of the subsidiary rite (after the return from the preceptor's abode) are sufficient (evidence) for settling the reverence due to him and indeed, confirm the reverence actually paid to him. [^703] In consequence of his bringing up the son <span id="p248"><sup><small>[ p. 248 ]</small></sup></span> and instructing him, the sire is the son's foremost of superiors and the highest religion. The very Vedas lay it down as certain that the son should regard what the sire says as his highest duty. Unto the sire the son is only a source of joy. Unto the son, however, the sire is all in all. The body and all else that the son owns have the sire alone for their giver. Hence, the behests of the sire should be obeyed without ever questioning them in the least. The very sins of one that obeys one's sire are cleansed (by such obedience). The sire is the giver of all articles of food, of instructions in the Vedas, and of all other knowledge regarding the world. (Prior to the son's birth) the sire is the performer of such rites as Garbhadhana and Simantonnayana. [^704] The sire is religion. The sire is heaven. The sire is the highest penance. The sire being gratified, all the deities are gratified. Whatever words are pronounced by the sire become blessings that attach to the son. The words expressive of joy that the sire utters cleanse the son of all his sins. The flower is seen to fall away from the stalk. The fruit is seen to fall away from the tree. But the sire, whatever his distress, moved by parental affection, never abandons the son. These then are my reflections upon the reverence due from the son to the sire. Unto the son the sire is not an ordinary object. I shall now think upon (what is due to) the mother. Of this union of the five (primal) elements in me due to my birth as a human being, the mother is the (chief) cause as the firestick of fire. [^705] The mother is as the fire-stick with respect to the bodies of all men. She is the panacea for all kinds of calamities. The existence of the mother invests one with protection; the reverse deprives one of all protection. The man who, though divested of prosperity, enters his house, uttering the words, ‘O mother!’—hath not to indulge in grief. Nor doth decrepitude ever assail him. A person whose mother exists, even if he happens to be possessed of sons and grandsons and even if he counts a hundred years, looks like a child of but two years of age. Able or disabled, lean or robust, the son is always protected by the mother. None else, according to the ordinance, is the son's protector. Then doth the son become old, then doth he become stricken with grief, then doth the world look empty in his eyes, when he becomes deprived of his mother. There is no shelter (protection against the sun) like the mother. There is no refuge like the mother. There is no defence like the mother. There is no one so dear as the mother. For having borne him in her womb the mother is the son's _Dhatri_. For having been the <span id="p249"><sup><small>[ p. 249 ]</small></sup></span> chief cause of his birth, she is his _Janani_. For having nursed his young limbs into growth, she is called _Amva_. For bringing forth a child possessed of courage she is called _Virasu_. For nursing and looking after the son she is called _Sura_. The mother is one's own body. What rational man is there that would slay his mother, to whose care alone it is due that his own head did not lie on the street-side like a dry gourd? When husband and wife unite themselves for procreation, the desire cherished with respect to the (unborn) son are cherished by both, but in respect of their fruition more depends upon the mother than on the sire. [^706] The mother knows the family in which the son is born and the father who has begotten him. From the moment of conception the mother begins to show affection to her child and takes delight in her. (For this reason, the son should behave equally towards her). On the other hand, the scriptures declare that the offspring belongs to the father alone. If men, after accepting the hands of wives in marriage and pledging themselves to earn religious merit without being dissociated from them, seek congress with other people's wives, they then cease to be worthy of respect. [^707] The husband, because he supports the wife, is called _Bhartri_, and, because he protects her, he is on that account called _Pati_. When these two functions disappear from him, he ceases to be both _Bhartri_ and _Pati_. [^708] Then again woman can commit no fault. It is man only that commits faults. By perpetrating an act of adultery, the man only becomes stained with guilt. [^709] It has been said that the husband is the highest object with the wife and the highest deity to her. My mother gave up her sacred person to one that came to her in the form and guise of her husband. Women can commit no fault. It is man who becomes stained with fault. Indeed, in consequence of the natural weakness of the sex as displayed in every act, and their liability to solicitation, women cannot be regarded as offenders. Then again the sinfulness (in this case) is evident of Indra himself who (by acting in the way he did) caused the recollection of the request that had been made to him in days of yore by woman (when a third part of the sin of Brahmanicide of which Indra himself was guilty was cast upon her sex). There is no doubt that my mother is innocent. She whom I have been commanded to slay is a woman. That woman is again my mother. She occupies, therefore, a place of greater reverence. The very beasts that are irrational know that the mother is <span id="p250"><sup><small>[ p. 250 ]</small></sup></span> unslayable. The sire must be known to be a combination of all the deities together. To the mother, however, attaches a combination of all mortal creatures and all the deities. [^710]\—In consequence of his habit of reflecting long before acting, Gautama's son Chirakarin, by indulging in those reflections, passed a long while (without accomplishing the act he had been commanded by his sire to accomplish). When many days had expired, his sire Gautama's returned. Endued with great wisdom, Medhatithi of Gautama's race, engaged in the practice of penances, came back (to his retreat), convinced, after having reflected for that long time, of the impropriety of the chastisement he had commanded to be inflicted upon his wife. Burning with grief and shedding copious tears, for repentance had come to him in consequence of the beneficial effects of that calmness of temper which is brought about by a knowledge of the scriptures, he uttered these words, 'The lord of the three worlds, _viz_., Purandara, came to my retreat, in the guise of a Brahmana asking for hospitality. He was received by me with (proper) words, and honoured with a (proper) welcome, and presented in due form with water to wash his feet and the usual offerings of the _Arghya_. I also granted him the rest he had asked for. I further told him that I had obtained a protector in him. I thought that such conduct on my part would induce him to behave towards me as a friend. When, however, notwithstanding all this, he misbehaved himself, my wife Ahalya could not be regarded to have committed any fault. It seems that neither my wife, nor myself, nor Indra himself who while passing through the sky had beheld my wife (and become deprived of his senses by her extraordinary beauty), could be held to have offended. The blame really attaches to the carelessness of my Yoga puissance. [^711] The sages have said that all calamities spring from envy, which, in its turn, arises from error of judgment. By that envy, also, I have been dragged from where I was and plunged into an ocean of sin (in the form of wife-slaughter). Alas, I have slain a woman,—a woman that is again my wife—one, that is, who, in consequence of her sharing her lord's calamities came to be called by the name of _Vasita_,—one that was called _Bharya_ owing to the obligation I was under of supporting her. Who is there that can rescue me from this sin? Acting heedlessly I commanded the high-souled Chirakarin (to slay that wife of mine). If on the present occasion he proves true to his name then may he rescue me from this guilt. Twice blessed be thou, O Chirakaraka! If on this occasion thou hast delayed accomplishing the work, then art thou truly worthy of thy name. Rescue me, and thy mother, and the penances I have achieved, as also thy own self, from grave sins. Be thou really a Chirakaraka <span id="p251"><sup><small>[ p. 251 ]</small></sup></span> today! Ordinarily, in consequence of thy great wisdom thou takest a long time for reflection before achieving any act. Let not thy conduct be otherwise today! Be thou a true Chirakaraka today. Thy mother had expected thy advent for a long time. For a long time did she bear thee in her womb. O Chirakaraka, let thy habit of reflecting long before acting be productive of beneficial results today. Perhaps, my son Chirakaraka is delaying today (to achieve my bidding) in view of the sorrow it would cause me (to see him execute that bidding). Perhaps, he is sleeping over that bidding, bearing it in his heart (without any intention of executing it promptly). Perhaps, he is delaying, in view of the grief it would cause both him and me, reflecting upon the circumstances of the case.' Indulging in such repentance, O king, the great _Rishi_ Gautama then beheld his son Chirakarin sitting near him. Beholding his sire come back to their abode, the son Chirakarin, overwhelmed with grief, cast away the weapon (he had taken up) and bowing his head began to pacify Gautama. Observing his son prostrated before him with bent head, and beholding also his wife almost petrified with shame, the _Rishi_ became filled with great joy. From that time the highsouled _Rishi_, dwelling in that lone hermitage, did not live separately from his spouse or his heedful son. Having uttered the command that his wife should be slain he had gone away from his retreat for accomplishing some purpose of his own. Since that time his son had stood in an humble attitude, weapon in hand, for executing that command on his mother. Beholding that his son prostrated at his feet, the sire thought that, struck with fear, he was asking for pardon for the offence he had committed in taking up a weapon (for killing his own mother). The sire praised his son for a long time, and smelt his head for a long time, and for a long time held him in a close embrace, and blessed him, uttering the words, ‘Do thou live long!’ Then, filled with joy and contented with what had occurred, Gautama, O thou of great wisdom, addressed his son and said these words, ‘Blessed be thou, O Chirakaraka! Do thou always reflect long before acting. By thy delay in accomplishing my bidding thou hast today made me happy for ever.’ That learned and best of _Rishis_ then uttered these verses upon the subject of the merits of such cool men as reflect for a long time before setting their hands to any action. If the matter is the death of a friend, one should accomplish it after a long while. If it is the abandonment of a project already begun, one should abandon it after a long while. A friendship that is formed after a long examination lasts for a long time. In giving way to wrath, to haughtiness, to pride, to disputes, to sinful acts, and in accomplishing all disagreeable tasks he that delays long deserves applause. When the offence is not clearly proved against a relative, a friend, a servant, or a wife, he that reflects long before inflicting the punishment is applauded.' Thus, O Bharata, was Gautama pleased with his son, O thou of Kuru's race, for that act of delay on the latter's part in doing the former's bidding. In all acts a man should, in this way, reflect for a long time and then settle what he should do. By conducting himself in this way one is sure to avoid grief for a long time. That man who never nurses his wrath for a long while, who reflects for a long time before setting himself to the performance <span id="p252"><sup><small>[ p. 252 ]</small></sup></span> of any act, never does any act which brings repentance. One should wait for a long while upon those that are aged, and sitting near them show them reverence. One should attend to one's duties for a long time and be engaged for a long while in ascertaining them. Waiting for a long time upon those that are learned, are reverentially serving for a long time those that are good in behaviour, and keeping one's soul for a long while under proper restraint, one succeeds in enjoying the respect of the world for a long time. One engaged in instructing others on the subject of religion and duty, should, when asked by another for information on those subjects, take a long time to reflect before giving an answer. He may then avoid indulging in repentance (for returning an incorrect answer whose practical consequences may lead to sin).—As regards Gautama of austere penances, that _Rishi_, having adored the deities for a long while in that retreat of his, at last ascended to heaven with his son.'"

“Yudhishthira said, ‘How, indeed, should the king protect his subjects without injuring anybody. I ask thee this, O grandsire, tell me, O foremost of good men!’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old narrative of the conversation between Dyumatsena and king Satyavat. We have heard that upon a certain number of individuals having been brought out for execution at the command of his sire (Dyumatsena), prince Satyavat said certain words that had never before been said by anybody else. [^712] ‘Sometimes righteousness assumes the form of iniquity, and iniquity assumes the form of righteousness. It can never be possible that the killing of individuals can ever be a righteous act.’

“Dyumatsena said, 

“Satyavat said,  [^716] ”Dyumatsena said, ‘As long as those barriers within which men should be kept are not transgressed, so long are they designated by the name of Righteousness. If they who transgressed those, barriers were not punished with death, those barriers would soon be destroyed. Men of remote and remoter <span id="p254"><sup><small>[ p. 254 ]</small></sup></span> times were capable of being governed with ease. [^717] They were very truthful (in speech and conduct). They were little disposed to disputes and quarrels. They seldom gave way to anger, or, if they did, their wrath never became ungovernable. In those days the mere crying of _fie_ on offenders was sufficient punishment. After this came the punishment represented by harsh speeches or censures. Then followed the punishment of fines and forfeitures. In this age, however, the punishment of death has become current. The measure of wickedness has increased to such an extent that by slaying one others cannot be restrained. [^718] The robber has no connection with men, with the deities, with the Gandharvas, and with the _Pitris_. What is he to whom? He is not anybody to any one. This is the declaration of the _Srutis_. [^719] The robber takes away the ornaments of corpses from cemeteries, and swearing apparel from men afflicted by spirits (and, therefore, deprived of senses). That man is a fool who would make any covenant with those miserable wretches or exact any oath from them (for relying upon it).’ [^720]

“Satyavat said, ‘If thou dost not succeed in making honest men of those rogues and in saving them by means unconnected with slaughter, do thou then exterminate them by performing some sacrifice. [^721] Kings practise severe austerities for the sake of enabling their subjects go on prosperously in their avocations. When thieves and robbers multiply in their kingdoms they become ashamed.. They, therefore, betake themselves to penances for suppressing thefts and robberies and making their subjects live happily. Subjects can be made honest by being only frightened (by the king). Good kings never slay the wicked from motives of retribution. (On the other hand, if they slay, they slay in sacrifices, when the motive is to do good to the slain), Good kings abundantly succeed in ruling their subjects properly with the aid of good conduct (instead of cruel or punitive inflictions). If the king acts properly, the superior subjects imitate him. The inferior people, again in their turn, imitate their immediate superiors. Men are so constituted <span id="p255"><sup><small>[ p. 255 ]</small></sup></span> that they imitate those whom they regard as their superiors. [^722] That king who, without restraining himself, seeks to restrain others (from evil ways) becomes an object of laughter with all men in consequence of his being engaged in the enjoyment of all worldly pleasures as a slave of his senses. That man who, through arrogance or error of judgment, offends against the king in any way, should be restrained by every means. It is by this way that he is prevented from committing offences anew. The king should first restrain his own self if he desires to restrain others that offend. He should punish heavily (if necessary) even friends and near relatives. In that kingdom where a vile offender does not meet with heavy afflictions, offences increase and righteousness decreases without doubt. Formerly, a Brahmana. endued with clemency and possessed of learning, taught me this. Verily, to this effect, O sire, I have been instructed by also our grandsire of olden days, who gave such assurances of harmlessness to people, moved by pity. Their words were, ‘In the Krita age, kings should rule their subjects by adopting ways that are entirely harmless. In the Treta age, kings conduct themselves according to ways that conform with righteousness fallen away by a fourth from its full complement. In the Dwapara age, they proceed according to ways conforming with righteousness fallen away by a moiety, and in the age that follows, according to ways conforming with righteousness fallen away by three-fourth. When the Kati age sets in, through the wickedness of kings and in consequence of the nature of the epoch itself, fifteen parts of even that fourth portion of righteousness disappear, a sixteenth portion thereof being all that then remains of it. If, O Satyavat, by adopting the method first mentioned (_viz_., the practice of harmlessness), confusion sets in, the king, considering the period of human life, the strength of human beings, and the nature of the time that has come, should award punishments. [^723] Indeed, Manu, the son of the Self-born, has, through compassion for human beings, indicated the way by means of which men may adhere to knowledge (instead of harmfulness) for the sake of emancipation.’” [^724]

## SECTION CCLXVIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Thou hast already explained to me, O grandsire, how the religion of Yoga, which leads to the six well-known attributes, may be adopted <span id="p256"><sup><small>[ p. 256 ]</small></sup></span> and practised without injuring any creature. Tell me, O grandsire, of that religion which leads to both results, _viz_., Enjoyment and Emancipation. Amongst these two, _viz_., the duties of domesticity and those of Yoga, both of which lead to the same end, which is superior?’

“Bhishma said, ‘Both courses of duty are highly blessed. Both are extremely difficult of accomplishment. Both are productive of high fruits. Both are practised by those that are admittedly good. I shall presently discourse to thee on the authoritativeness of both those courses of duty, for dispelling thy doubts about their true import. Listen to me with concentrated attention. In this connection is instanced the old narrative of the discourse between Kapila and the cow. Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! [^725] It has been heard by us that in days of old when the deity Tvashtri came to the place of king Nahusha, the latter, for discharging the duties of hospitality, was on the point of killing a cow agreeably to the true, ancient, and eternal injunction of the Vedas. Beholding that cow tied for slaughter, Kapila of liberal soul, ever observant of the duties of Sattwa, always engaged in restraining his senses, possessed of true knowledge, and abstemious in diet, having acquired an excellent understanding that was characterised by faith, perfectly fearless, beneficial, firm, and ever directed towards truth, uttered this word once, _viz_.,—‘_Alas ye Vedas_!’—At that time a _Rishi_, of the name of Syumarasmi, entering (by Yoga power) the form of that cow, addressed the Yati Kapila, saying, ‘Hist O Kapila! If the Vedas be deserving (in consequence of those declarations in them that sanction the slaughter of living creatures), whence have those other duties (fraught with entire harmlessness to all creatures) come to be regarded as authoritative? [^726] Men devoted to penances and endued with intelligence, and who have the _Srutis_ and knowledge for their eyes, regard the injunctions of the Vedas, which have been declared through and compiled by the _Rishis_, to be the words of God himself. [^727] What can anybody say (by way of censure or praise) with respect to the contents of the Vedas when these happen to be the words of the Supreme Being himself who is freed from desire of fruit, who is without the fever (of envy and aversion), who is addicted to nothing, and who is destitute of all exertion (in consequence of the immediate fruition of all his wishes)?’

“Kapila said, ‘I do not censure the Vedas. I do not wish to say anything in derogation of them. It hath been heard by us that the different courses of duty laid down for the different modes of life, all lead to the same end. The <span id="p257"><sup><small>[ p. 257 ]</small></sup></span> Sannyasin attains to a high end. The forest-recluse also attains to a high end. Both the other two also, _viz_., the householder and the Brahmacharin, reach the same end. All the four modes of life have always been regarded as _Deva-yana_ ways. The relative strength or weakness of these, as represented by their relative superiority or inferiority, hath been declared in the character of their respective ends. [^728]\—Knowing these, accomplish acts which lead to heaven and other blessings,—this is a Vedic declaration.—Do not accomplish acts,—this also is another binding declaration of the Vedas. If abstention from acts be meritorious, then their accomplishment must be exceedingly reprehensible. When the scriptures stand thus, the strength or weakness of particular declarations must be very difficult to ascertain. If thou knowest of any course of duty which is superior to the religion of harmlessness, and which depends upon direct evidence instead of that of the scriptures, do thou then discourse to me upon it.’

“Syumarasmi said, ‘One should perform sacrifice from desire of heaven,—this _Sruti_ is constantly heard by us. Thinking first of the fruit (that is to be attained), one makes preparations for sacrifice. Goat, horse, cow, all species of birds, domestic or wild, and herbs and plants, are food of (other) living creatures. This is heard by us. [^729] Food again has been directed to be taken day after day morning and evening. Then again the _Sruti_ declares that animals and grain are the limbs of Sacrifice. [^730] The Lord of the universe created them along with Sacrifice. The puissant Lord of all creatures caused the deities to perform sacrifices with their aid. Altogether seven (domestic) and seven (wild) animals are indicated as fit for sacrifice. Instead of all being equally fit, each succeeding one is inferior to each preceding one. The Vedas again declare that the whole universe is appointed for sacrifice. Him also that is called Purusha the Vedas have appointed for the same purpose. [^731] This again hath been sanctioned by men of remote and remoter times. What man of learning is there that does not select, according to his own ability, individuals from among living creatures for sacrifice? [^732] The inferior animals, human beings, trees, and herbs, all wish for the attainment of heaven. There is no means, however, except sacrifice, by which they can obtain the fruition <span id="p258"><sup><small>[ p. 258 ]</small></sup></span> of that desire. The deciduous herbs, animals, trees, creepers, clarified butter, milk, curds, meat and other approved things (that are poured on the sacrificial fire), land, the points of the compass, faith, and time which brings up the tale of twelve, the Richs, the Yajuses, the Samans, and the sacrificer himself bringing up the tale to sixteen, and Fire which should be known as the householder,—these seventeen are said to be the limbs of sacrifice. Sacrifice, the Sruti declares, is the root of the world and its course. With clarified butter, milk, curds, dung, curds mixed with milk, skin, the hair in her tail, horns, and hoofs, the cow alone is able to furnish all the necessaries of sacrifice. Particular ones amongst these that are laid down for particular sacrifices, coupled with Ritwijas and presents (to the priests themselves and other Brahmanas) together sustain sacrifices. [^733] By collecting these things together, people accomplish sacrifices [^734]. This Sruti, consistent with the truth, is heard that all things have been created for the performance of sacrifice. It was thus that all men of ancient time set themselves to the performance of sacrifices. As regards that person, however, who performs sacrifices because of the conviction that sacrifices should be performed and not for the sake of fruit or reward, it is seen that he does not injure any creature or bear himself with hostility to anything, or set himself to the accomplishment of any worldly task. [^735] Those things that have been named as the limbs of sacrifice, and those other things that have been mentioned as required in sacrifices and that are indicated in the ordinances, all uphold one another (for the completion of sacrifices) when used according to the approved ritual. [^736] I behold also the _Smritis_ compiled by he _Rishis_, into which the Vedas have been introduced. Men of learning regard them as authoritative in consequence of their following the Brahmanas. [^737] Sacrifices have the Brahmanas for that progenitor, and truly they rest upon the Brahmanas. The whole universe rests upon sacrifice, and sacrifice rests upon the universe. [^738] The syllable _Om_ is the root from which the Vedas have sprung. (Every rite, therefore, should commence with the utterance of that syllable of vast import). Of him who has uttered for him the syllables Om, Namas, Swaha, Svadha, and Vashat, and who has, according to the extent of his ability, performed sacrifices and other rites, there is no fear in respect of next life in all the three worlds. Thus say the Vedas, and sages crowned with ascetic success, and the foremost of Rishis. He in whom are the Richs, the Yajuses, the Samans, and the expletives <span id="p259"><sup><small>[ p. 259 ]</small></sup></span> necessary for completing the rhythm of the Samans according to the rules laid down in Vedic grammars, is, indeed, a Brahmana. [^739] Thou knowest, O adorable Brahmana, what the fruits are of Agnihotra, of the Soma-sacrifice, and of the other great sacrifices. I say, for this reason, one should sacrifice and assist at other people's sacrifices, without scruples of any kind. One who performs such sacrifices as lead to heaven (such as Jyotishtoma, etc.) obtains high rewards hereafter in the form of heavenly beatitude. This is certain, _viz_., that they who do not perform sacrifices have neither this world nor the next. They who are really conversant with the declarations of the Vedas regard both kinds of declarations (_viz_., those that incite to acts and those that preach abstention) as equally authoritative.’”

## SECTION CCLXIX

“Kapila said, ‘Beholding that all the fruits that are attainable by acts are terminable instead of being eternal, Yatis, by adopting self-restraint and tranquillity, attain to Brahma through the path of knowledge. There is nothing in any of the worlds that can impede them (for by mere fiats of their will they crown all their wishes with success). They are freed from the influence of all pairs of opposites. They never bow down their heads to anything or any creature. They are above all the bonds of want. Wisdom is theirs. Cleansed they are from every sin. Pure and spotless they live and rove about (in great happiness). They have, in their own understandings, arrived at settled conclusions in respect of all destructible objects and of a life of Renunciation (by comparing the two together). Devoted to Brahma, already become like unto Brahma, they have taken refuge in Brahma. Transcending grief, and freed from (the equality of) Rajas, theirs are acquisitions that are eternal. When the high end that is these men's is within reach of attainment, what need has one for practising the duties of the domestic mode of life?' [^740]

“Syumarasmi said, ‘If, indeed, that be the highest object of acquisition, if that be truly the highest end (which is attained by practising Renunciation) then the importance of the domestic mode of life becomes manifest, because without the domestic mode no other mode of life ever becomes possible. Indeed, as all living creatures are able to live in consequence of their dependence on their respective mothers, after the same manner the three other <span id="p260"><sup><small>[ p. 260 ]</small></sup></span> modes of life exist in consequence of their dependence upon the domestic mode. The householder who leads the life of domesticity, performs sacrifices, and practises penances. Whatever is done by anybody from desire of happiness has for its root the domestic mode of life. All living creatures regard the procreation of offspring as a source of great happiness. The procreation of offspring, however, becomes impossible in any other mode of life (than domesticity). Every kind of grass and straw, all plants and herbs (that yield corn or grain), and others of the same class that grow on hills and mountains, have the domestic mode of life for their root. Upon those depend the life of living creatures. And since nothing else is seen (in the universe) than life, domesticity may be looked upon as the refuge of the entire universe. [^741] Who then speaks the truth that says that domesticity cannot lead to the acquisition of Emancipation? Only those that are destitute of faith and wisdom and penetration, only those that are destitute of reputation that are idle and toil-worn, that have misery for their share in consequence of their past acts, only those that are destitute of learning, behold the plenitude of tranquillity in a life of mendicancy. The eternal and certain distinctions (laid down in the Vedas) are the causes that sustain the three worlds. That illustrious person of the highest order who is conversant with the Vedas, is worshipped from the very date of his birth. Besides the performance of _Garbhadhana_, Vedic _mantras_ become necessary for enabling persons of the regenerate classes to accomplish all their acts in respect of both this and the other world. [^742] In cremating his body (after death), in the matter of his attainment of a second body, in that of his drink and food after such attainment, in that of giving away kine and other animals for helping him to cross the river that divides the region of life from that of Yama, in that of sinking funeral cakes in water—Vedic _mantras_ are necessary. Then again the three classes of _Pitris_, _viz_., the Archishmats, the Varhishads, and the Kravyads, approve of the necessity of _mantras_ in the case of the dead, and _mantras_ are allowed to be efficient causes (for attainment of the objects for which these ceremonies and rites have been directed to be performed). When the Vedas say this so loudly and when again human beings are said to owe debts to the _Pitris_, the _Rishis_, and the gods, how can any one attain to Emancipation? [^743] This false doctrine (of incorporeal existence called Emancipation), apparently dressed in colours of truth, but subversive of the real purport of <span id="p261"><sup><small>[ p. 261 ]</small></sup></span> the declarations of the Vedas, has been introduced by learned men reft of prosperity and eaten up by idleness. That Brahmana who performs sacrifices according to the declarations of the Vedas is never seduced by sin. Through sacrifices, such a person attains to high regions of felicity along with the animals he has slain in those sacrifices, and himself, gratified by the acquisition of all his wishes succeeds in gratifying those animals by fulfilling their wishes. By disregarding the Vedas, by guile, or by deception, one never succeeds in attaining to the Supreme. On the other hand, it is by practising the rites laid down in the Vedas that one succeeds in attaining to Brahma.’

“Kapila said, ‘(If acts are obligatory, then) there are the _Darsa_, the _Paurnamasa_, the _Agnihotra_, the _Chaturmasya_, and other acts for the man of intelligence. In their performance is eternal merit. (Why then perform acts involving cruelty)? Those that have betaken themselves to the Sannyasa, mode of life, that abstain from all acts, that are endued with patience, that are cleansed (of wrath and every fault), and that are conversant with Brahma, succeed by such knowledge of Brahma in paying off the debts (thou speakest of) to the gods (the _Rishis_, and the _Pitris_) represented to be so very fond of libations poured in sacrifices. [^744] The very gods become stupefied in tracing the track of that trackless person who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures and who looks upon all creatures with an equal eye. Through instructions received from the preceptor one knows that which dwells within this frame to be of a four-fold nature, having besides four doors and four mouths. In consequence of (their possession of) two arms, the organ of speech, the stomach, and the organ of pleasure, the very gods are said to have four doors. One should, therefore, strive one's best to keep those doors under control. [^745] One should <span id="p262"><sup><small>[ p. 262 ]</small></sup></span> not gamble with dice. One should not appropriate what belongs to another. One should not assist at the sacrifice of a person of ignoble birth. One should not, giving way to wrath, smite another with hands or feet. That intelligent man who conducts himself in this way is said to have his hands and feet well-controlled. One should not indulge in vociferous abuse or censure. One should not speak words that are vain. One should forbear from knavery and from calumniating others. One should observe the vow of truthfulness, be sparing of speech, and always heedful.’ By conducting oneself in this way one will have one's organ of speech well-restrained. One should not abstain entirely from food. One should not eat too much. One should give up covetousness, and always seek the companionship of the good. One should eat only so much as is needed for sustaining life. By conducting oneself in this way one succeeds in properly controlling the door represented by one's stomach. One should not, O hero, lustfully take another wife when one has a wedded spouse (with whom to perform all religious acts). One should never summon a woman to bed except in her season. One should confine oneself to one's own wedded spouse without seeking congress with other women. By conducting oneself in this way one is said to have one's organ of pleasure properly controlled. That man of wisdom is truly a regenerate person who has all his four doors, _viz_., the organ of pleasure, the stomach, the two arms (and two feet), and the organ of speech, properly controlled. Everything becomes useless of that person whose doors are not well-controlled. What can the penance of such a man do? What can his sacrifices bring about? What cart be achieved by his body? The gods know him for a Brahmana who has cast off his upper garment, who sleeps on the bare ground, who makes his arm a pillow, and whose heart is possessed of tranquillity. [^746] That person who, devoted to contemplation, singly enjoys all the happiness that wedded couples enjoy, and who turns not his attention to the joys and griefs of others, should be known for a Brahmana. [^747] That man who rightly understands all this as it exists in reality and its multiform transformations, and who knows what the end is of all created objects, is known by the gods for a Brahmana. [^748] One who hath no fear from any creature and from whom no <span id="p263"><sup><small>[ p. 263 ]</small></sup></span> creature hath any fear and who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures, should be known for a Brahmana. Without having acquired purity of heart which is the true result of all pious acts such as gifts and sacrifices, men of foolish understandings do not succeed in obtaining a knowledge of what is needed in making one a Brahmana even when explained by preceptors. Destitute of a knowledge of all this, these men desire fruits of a different kind, _viz_., heaven and its joys. [^749] Unable to practise even a small part of that good conduct which has come down from remote times, which is eternal, which is characterised by certitude, which enters as a thread in all our duties, and by adopting which men of knowledge belonging to all the modes of life convert their respective duties and penances into terrible weapons for destroying the ignorance and evils of worldliness, men of foolish understandings regard acts that are productive of visible fruits, that are fraught with the highest puissance, and that are deathless, as fruitless after all and as deviations (from the proper course) not sanctioned by the scriptures. In truth, however, that conduct, embracing as it does practices the very opposite of those that are seen in seasons of distress, is the very essence of heedfulness and is never affected by lust and wrath and other passions of a similar kind. [^750] As regards sacrifices again, it is very difficult to ascertain all their particulars. If ascertained, it is very difficult to observe them in practice. If practised, the fruits to which they lead are terminable. Mark this well. (And marking this, do thou betake thyself to the path of knowledge).’

“Syumarasmi said, ‘The Vedas countenance acts and discountenance them. <span id="p264"><sup><small>[ p. 264 ]</small></sup></span> Whence then is their authority when their declarations thus contradict each other? Renunciation of acts, again, is productive of great benefit. Both these have been indicated in the Vedas. Do thou discourse to me on this subject, O Brahmana!’

“Kapila said, ‘Betaking yourselves to the path of the good (_viz_., Yoga), do you even in this life realise its fruits by the direct evidence of your senses. What, however, are the visible results of those other objects which you (men of acts) pursue?’

“Syumarasmi said, ‘O Brahmana, I am Syumarasmi by name. I have come here for acquiring knowledge. Desirous of doing good to myself I have started this conversation in artless candour and not from desire of disputation. The dark doubt has taken possession of my mind. O illustrious one, solve it to me. Thou hast said that they who take the path of the good (_viz_., Yoga), by which Brahma is attained, realise its fruits by the direct evidence of their senses. What, indeed, is that which is so realisable by the direct evidence of the senses and which is pursued by yourselves? Avoiding all sciences that have disputation only for their foremost object, I have so studied the Agama as to have July mastered their true meaning. By Agama I understand the declarations of the Vedas. I also include la that word those sciences based on logic which have for their object the bringing out of the real meaning of the Vedas. [^751] Without avoiding the duties laid down for the particular mode of life which one may lead, one should pursue the practices laid down in Agama. Such observance of the practices laid down in Agama crowns one with success. In consequence of the certainty of the conclusions of Agama, the success to which the latter leads may be said to be almost realisable by direct evidence. As a boat that is tied to another bound for a different port, cannot take its passengers to the port they desire to reach, even so ourselves, dragged by our acts due to past desires, can never cross the interminable river of birth and death (and reach the heaven of rest and peace we may have in view). Discourse to me on this topic, O illustrious one! Teach me as a preceptor teaches a disciple. No one can be found amongst men that has completely renounced all worldly objects, nor one that is perfectly contented with oneself, nor one that has transcended grief, nor one that is perfectly free from disease, nor one that is absolutely free from the desire to act (for one's own benefit), nor one that has an absolute distaste for companionship, nor one that has entirely abstained from acts of every kind. Even men like yourself are seen to give way to joy and indulge in grief as persons like ourselves. Like other creatures the senses of persons like yourselves have their functions and objects. Tell me, in what then, if we are to investigate the question of happiness, does pure felicity consist for all the four orders of men and all the four modes of life who and which have, as regards their inclinations, the same resting ground.’

<span id="p265"><sup><small>[ p. 265 ]</small></sup></span>

“Kapila said, ‘Whatever the _Sastras_ according to which one performs the acts one feels inclined to do, the ordinances laid down in it for regulating those acts never become fruitless. Whatever again the school of opinion according to which one may conduct oneself, one is sure to attain to the highest end by only observing the duties of self-restraint of Yoga. Knowledge assists that man in crossing (this interminable river of life and death) who pursues knowledge. That conduct, however, which men pursue after deviating from the path of knowledge, afflicts them (by subjecting them to the evils of life and death). It is evident that ye are possessed of knowledge and dissociated from every worldly object that may produce distress. But have any of you at any time succeeded in acquiring that knowledge in consequence of which everything is capable of being viewed as identical with one Universal Soul? [^752] Without a correct apprehension of the scriptures, some there are, fond only of disputation, who, in consequence of being overwhelmed by desire and aversion, become the slaves of pride and arrogance. Without having correctly understood the meaning of scriptural declarations, these robbers of the scriptures, these depredators of Brahma, influenced by arrogance and error, refuse to pursue tranquillity and practise self-restraint. [^753] These men behold fruitlessness on every side, and if (by chance) they succeed in obtaining the puissance of knowledge they never impart it to others for rescuing them. Made up entirely of the quality of Tamas, they have Tamas only for their refuge. One becomes subject to all the incidents of that nature which one imbibes. Accordingly, of him who hath Tamas for his refuge, the passions of envy, lust, wrath, pride, falsehood, and vanity, continually grow, for one's qualities have one's nature for their spring. Thinking in this strain and beholding these faults (through the aid of instructions secured from preceptors), Yatis, who covet the highest end, betake themselves to Yoga, leaving both good and ill.’ [^754]

“Syumarasmi said, ‘O Brahmana, all that I have said (about the laudable character of acts and the opposite character of Renunciation) is strictly conformable to the scriptures. It is, however, very true that without a correct apprehension of the meaning of the scriptures, one does not feel inclined to obey what the scriptures really declare. Whatever conduct is consistent with equity is consistent with the scriptures. Even that is what the Sruti declares. Similarly, whatever conduct is inconsistent with equity is inconsistent with the scriptures. This also is declared by the Sruti. It is certain that no one can do an act that is scriptural by transgressing the scriptures. That again is <span id="p266"><sup><small>[ p. 266 ]</small></sup></span> unscriptural which is against the Vedas. The _Sruti_ declares this. Many men, who believe only what directly appeals to their senses, behold only this world (and not what is addressed in the scriptures to Faith). They do not behold what the scriptures declare to be faults. They have, accordingly, like ourselves, to give way to grief. Those objects of the senses with which men like you are concerned are the same with which other living creatures are concerned. Yet in consequence of your knowledge of the soul and their ignorance of it, how vast is the difference that exists between you and them! All the four orders of men and all the four modes of life, however different their duties, seek the same single end (_viz_., the highest happiness). Thou art possessed of unquestioned talents and abilities. For ascertaining that particular course of conduct (amongst those various duties) which is well calculated to accomplish the desired end, thou hast, by discoursing to me on the Infinite (Brahma), filled my soul with tranquillity. As regards ourselves, in consequence of our inability to understand the Soul we are destitute of a correct apprehension of the reality. Our wisdom is concerned with things that are low, and we are enveloped in thick darkness. (The course of conduct, however, that thou hast indicated for enabling one to attain to Emancipation, is exceedingly difficult of practice). Only he who is devoted to Yoga, who has discharged all his duties, who is capable of roving everywhere depending only on his own body, who has brought his soul under perfect control, who has transcended the requirements of the science of morality and who disregards the whole world (and everything belonging to it), can transgress the declarations of the Vedas with respect to acts, and say that there is Emancipation. [^755] For one, however, who lives in the midst of relatives, this course of conduct is exceedingly difficult to follow. Gift, study of the Vedas, sacrifices, begetting offspring, simplicity of dealing, when by practising even these no one succeeds in attaining to Emancipation, fie on him who seeks to attain to it, and on Emancipation itself that is sought! It seems that the labour spent upon attaining to it is all fruitless. One becomes chargeable with atheism if one disregards the Vedas by not doing the acts they direct. O illustrious one, I desire to hear without delay about that (Emancipation) which comes in the Vedas after the declarations in favour of acts. Do tell me the truth, O Brahmana! I sit at thy feet as a disciple. Teach me kindly! I wish to know as much about Emancipation as is known to thee, O learned one!’

“Kapila said, ‘The Vedas are regarded as authoritative by all. People never <span id="p267"><sup><small>[ p. 267 ]</small></sup></span> disregard them. Brahma is of two kinds, _viz_., Brahma as represented by sound, and Brahma as Supreme (and intangible). [^756] One conversant with Brahma represented by sound succeeds in attaining to Supreme Brahma. Commencing with the rites of _Garbhadhana_, that body which the sire creates with the aid of Vedic _mantras_ is cleansed (after birth) by Vedic _mantras_. [^757] When the body has been cleansed with purificatory rites (performed with the aid of Vedic _mantras_), the owner there of come to be called a Brahmana and becomes a vessel fit for receiving knowledge of Brahma. Know that the reward of acts is purity of heart which only leads to Emancipation. I shall presently speak to thee of that. Whether purity of heart has been attained or not (by performance of acts) is what can be known to the person himself who has attained it. It can never be known with the aid of either the Vedas or inference. They that cherish no expectation, that discard every kind of wealth by not storing anything for future use, that are not covetous, and that are free from every kind of affection and aversion, perform sacrifices because of the conviction that their performance is a duty. To make gifts unto deserving persons is the end (right use) of all wealth. Never addicted at any time to sinful acts, observant of those rites that have been laid down in the Vedas, capable of crowning all their wishes with fruition, endued with certain conclusions through pure knowledge, never giving way to wrath,—never indulging in envy, free from pride and malice, firm in Yoga, [^758] of unstained birth, unstained conduct, and unstained learning, devoted to the good of all creatures, there were in days of yore many men, leading lives of domesticity and thoroughly devoted to their own duties, there were many kings also of the same qualifications, devoted to Yoga (like Janaka, etc.), and many Brahmanas also of the same character (like Yajnavalkya and others). [^759] They behaved equally towards all creatures and were endued with perfect sincerity. Contentment was theirs, and certainty of knowledge. Visible were the rewards of their righteousness, and pure were they in behaviour and heart. They were possessed of faith in Brahma of both forms. [^760] At first making their hearts pure, they duly observed all (excellent) vows. They were observant of the duties of righteousness on even occasions of distress and difficulty, without failing off in any particular. Uniting together they used to perform meritorious acts. In this they found great happiness. And inasmuch as they never tripped, they had never to perform any expiation. Relying as they did <span id="p268"><sup><small>[ p. 268 ]</small></sup></span> upon the true course of righteousness, they became endued with irresistible energy. They never followed their own understandings in the matter of earning merit but followed the dictates of the scriptures alone for that end. Accordingly they were never guilty of guile in the matter of performing acts of righteousness. [^761] In consequence of their observing unitedly the absolute ordinances of the scriptures without betaking themselves ever to the rites laid down in the alternative, they were never under the necessity of performing expiation. [^762] There is no expiation for men living in the observance of the ordinances laid down in the scriptures. The _Sruti_ declares that expiation exists for only men that are weak and unable to follow the absolute and substantive provisions of the sacred law. Many Brahmanas there were of this kind in days of old, devoted to the performance of sacrifices, of profound knowledge of the Vedas, possessed of purity and good conduct, and endued with fame. They always worshipped Brahma in the sacrifices, and were free from desire. Possessed of learning they transcended all the bonds of life. The sacrifices of these men, their (knowledge of the) Vedas, their acts performed in obedience to the ordinances, their study of the scripture at the fixed hours, and the wishes they entertained, freed as they were from lust and wrath, observant as they were of pious conduct and acts notwithstanding all difficulties, renowned as they were for performing the duties of their own order and mode of life, purified as their souls were in consequence of their very nature, characterised as they were by thorough sincerity, devoted as they were to tranquillity, and mindful as they were of their own practices, were identical with Infinite Brahma. Even this is the eternal _Sruti_ heard by us. [^763] The penances of men that were so high-souled, of men whose conduct and acts were so difficult of observance and accomplishment, of men whose wishes were crowned with fruition in consequence of the strict discharge of their duties, became efficacious weapons for the destruction of all earthly desires. The Brahmanas say that that Good Conduct, which is wonderful, whose origin may be traced to very ancient times, which is eternal and whose characteristics are unchangeable, which differs from the practices to which even the good resort in seasons of distress and represents their acts in other situations, which is identical with heedfulness, over which lust and wrath and other evil passions can never prevail, and in consequence of which there was (at one time) no transgression in all mankind, subsequently came to be distributed into four subdivisions, corresponding with the four modes of life by persons unable to <span id="p269"><sup><small>[ p. 269 ]</small></sup></span> practise its duties in minute detail and entirety. [^764] They that are good, by duly observing that course of Good Conduct after adoption of the Sannyasa mode of life, attain to the highest end. They also that betake themselves to the forest mode reach the same high end (by duly observing that conduct). They too that observe the domestic mode of life attain to the highest end (by duly practising the same conduct); and, lastly, those that lead the Brahmacharya mode obtain the same (end by a due observance of the same conduct). [^765] Those Brahmanas are seen to shine in the firmament as luminaries shedding beneficent rays of light all around. Those myriads of Brahmanas have become stars and constellations set in their fixed tracks. In consequence of contentment (or Renunciation) they have all attained to Infinity as the Vedas declare. If such men have to come back to the world through the wombs of living creatures, they are never stained by sins which have the unexhausted residue of previous acts for their originating cause. Indeed, one who has led the life of a Brahmacharin and waited dutifully upon his preceptor, who has arrived at settled conclusions (in respect of the soul), and who has devoted himself to Yoga thus, is truly a Brahmana. Who else would deserve to be called a Brahmana? When acts alone determine who is a Brahmana and who is not, acts (good or bad) must be held to indicate the happiness or misery of a person. As regards those that have by conquering all evil passions acquired purity of heart, we have heard the eternal Sruti that in consequence of the Infinity to which they attain (through beholding the universal soul) and of the knowledge of Brahma (they acquire through the declarations of Srutis), they behold everything to be Brahma. The duties (of tranquillity, self-restraint, abstention from acts, renunciation, devotion, and the abstraction of Samadhi) followed by those men of pure hearts, that are freed from desire, and that have Emancipation only for their object, for acquisition of the knowledge of Brahma, are equally laid down for all the four orders of men and all the four modes of life. Verily, that knowledge is always acquired by Brahmanas of pure hearts and restrained soul. [^766] One whose soul is for Renunciation <span id="p270"><sup><small>[ p. 270 ]</small></sup></span> based upon contentment is regarded as the refuge of true knowledge. Renunciation, in which is that knowledge which leads to Emancipation, and which is highly necessary for a Brahmana, is eternal (and comes down from preceptor to pupil for ever and ever). [^767] Renunciation sometimes exists mixed with the duties of other modes. But whether existing in that state or by itself, one practises it according to the measure of one's strength (that depends upon the degree of one's absence of worldly desires). Renunciation is the cause of supreme benefit unto every kind of person. Only he that is weak, fails to practise it. That pure-hearted man who seeks to attain to Brahma becomes rescued from the world (with its misery).’ [^768]

“Syumarasmi said, ‘Amongst those that are given up to enjoyment (of property), they that make gifts, they that perform sacrifices, they that devote themselves to the study of the Vedas, and they that betake themselves to a life of Renunciation after having acquired and enjoyed wealth and all its pleasures, when they depart from this world, who is it that attains to the foremost place in heaven? I ask thee this, O Brahmana! Do thou tell me truly.’

“Kapila said, ‘Those who lead a life of domesticity are certainly auspicious and acquire excellence of every kind. They are unable, however, to enjoy the felicity that attaches to Renunciation. Even thou mayst see this.’ [^769]

“Syumarasmi said, ‘Ye depend upon knowledge as the means (for the attainment of Emancipation). Those who lead lives of domesticity have planted their faith in acts. It has, however, been said that the end of all modes of life is Emancipation. [^770] No difference, therefore, is observable between them in respect of either their superiority or inferiority of puissance. O illustrious one, do thou tell me then how stands the matter truly.’

“Kapila said, ‘Acts only cleanse the body. Knowledge, however, is the highest end (for which one strives). [^771] When all faults of the heart are cured (by acts), and when the felicity of Brahma becomes established in knowledge, <span id="p271"><sup><small>[ p. 271 ]</small></sup></span> benevolence, forgiveness, tranquillity, compassion, truthfulness, and candour, abstention from injury, absence of pride, modesty, renunciation, and abstention from work are attained. These constitute the path that lead to Brahma. By those one attains to what is the Highest. That the cure of all faults of the heart is the result of acts becomes intelligible to the wise man when these are attained. That, indeed, is regarded as the highest end which is obtained by Brahmanas endued with wisdom, withdrawn from all acts, possessed of purity and the certitude of knowledge. One who succeeds in acquiring a knowledge of the Vedas, of that which is taught by the Vedas (_viz_., Brahma as represented in acts), and the minutiae of acts, is said to be conversant with the Vedas. Any other man is only a bag of wind. [^772] One who is conversant with the Vedas knows everything, for everything is established on the Vedas. Verity, the present, past, and future all exist in the Vedas. [^773] This one conclusion is deducible from all the scriptures, _viz_., that this universe exists and does not exist. To the man of knowledge this (all that is perceived) is both _sat_ and _asat_. To him, this all is both the end and the middle. [^774] This truth rests upon all the Vedas, _viz_., that when complete Renunciation takes place one obtains what is sufficient. Then again the highest contentment follows and rests upon Emancipation, [^775] which is absolute, which exists as the soul of all mortal and immortal things, which is well-known as such universal soul, which is the highest object of knowledge as being identical with all mobile and immobile things, which is full, which is perfect felicity, which is without duality, which is the foremost of all things, which is Brahma, which is Unmanifest and the cause also, whence the Unmanifest has sprung, and which is without deterioration of any kind. [^776] Ability to subdue the senses, forgiveness, and abstention from work in consequence of the absence of desire,—these three are the cause of perfect felicity. With the aid of these three qualities, men having understanding for their eyes succeed in reaching that Brahma which is <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> uncreate, which is the prime cause of the universe, which is unchangeable and which is beyond destruction. I bow to that Brahma, which is identical with him that knows it.’” [^777]

“Yudhishthira said, ‘The Vedas, O Bharata, discourse of Religion. Profit, and Pleasure. Tell me, however, O grandsire, the attainment of which (amongst these three) is regarded as superior.’

“Bhishma said, ‘I shall, in this connection, recite to thee the ancient narrative of the benefit that Kundadhara in days of old had conferred upon one who was devoted to him. Once on a time a Brahmana destitute of wealth sought to acquire virtue, induced by the desire of fruit. He continually set his heart upon wealth for employing it in the celebration of sacrifices. For achieving his purpose he set himself to the practice of the austerest penances. Resolved to accomplish his purpose, he began to worship the deities with great devotion. But he failed to obtain wealth by such worship of the deities. He thereupon began to reflect, saying unto himself, ‘What is that deity, hitherto unadored by men, who may be favourably disposed towards me without delay?’ While reflecting in this strain with a cool mind, he beheld stationed before him that retainer of the deities, _viz_., the Cloud called Kundadhara. As soon as he beheld that mighty-armed being, the Brahmana's feelings of devotion were excited, and he said unto himself, ‘This one will surely bestow prosperity upon me. Indeed, his form indicates as much. He lives in close proximity to the deities. He has not as yet been adored by other men. He will verily give me abundant wealth without any delay.’ The Brahmana, then, having concluded thus, worshipped that Cloud with _dhupas_ and perfumes and garlands of flowers of the most superior kind, and with diverse kinds of offerings. Thus worshipped, the Cloud became very soon pleased with his worshipper and uttered these words fraught with benefit to that Brahmana, ‘The wise have ordained expiation for one guilty of Brahmanicide, or of drinking alcohol or of stealing, or of neglecting all meritorious vows. <span id="p273"><sup><small>[ p. 273 ]</small></sup></span> There is no expiation, however, for one that is ungrateful. [^778] Expectation hath a child named Iniquity. Ire, again, is regarded to be a child of Envy. Cupidity is the child of Deceit. Ingratitude, however, is barren (and hath no offspring). After this, that Brahmana, stretched on a bed of _Kusa_ grass, and penetrated with the energy of Kundadhara, beheld all living beings in a dream. Indeed, in consequence of his absence of passion, penances, and devotion, that Brahmana of cleansed soul, standing aloof from all (carnal) enjoyments, beheld in the night that effect of his devotion to Kundadhara. Indeed, O Yudhishthira, he beheld the high-souled Manibhadra of great effulgence stationed in the midst of the deities, employed in giving his orders. There the gods seemed to be engaged in bestowing kingdoms and riches upon men, induced by their good deeds, and in taking them away when men fell off from goodness. [^779] Then, O bull of Bharata's race, Kundadhara of great effulgence, bending himself low, prostrated himself on the ground before the gods in the presence of all the _Yakshas_. At the command of the gods the high-souled Manibhadra addressed the prostrate Kundadhara and said, ‘What does Kundadhara want?’ Thereupon Kundadhara replied, ‘If, indeed, the gods are pleased with me, there, that Brahmana reverences me greatly. I pray for some favour being shown to him, something, that is, that may bring him happiness.’ Hearing this, Manibhadra, commanded by the gods, once more said unto Kundadhara of great intelligence these words, ‘Rise, rise up, O Kundadhara! Thy suit is successful. Be thou happy. If this Brahmana be desirous of wealth, let wealth be given to him, that is, as much wealth as this thy friend desires. At the command of the gods I shall give him untold wealth.’ Kundadhara, then, reflecting upon the fleeting and unreal character of the status of humanity, set his heart, O Yudhishthira, upon inclining the Brahmana to penances. Indeed, Kundadhara said, ‘I do not, O giver of wealth, beg for wealth on behalf of this Brahmana. I desire the bestowal of another favour upon him. I do not solicit for this devotee of mine mountains of pearls and gems or even. the whole earth with all her riches. I desire, however, that he should be virtuous. Let his heart find pleasure in virtue. Let him have virtue for his stay. Let virtue be the foremost of all objects with him. Even this is the favour that meets with my approval.’ Manibhadra said, ‘The fruits of virtue are always sovereignty and happiness of diverse kinds. Let this one enjoy those fruits, always freed from physical pain of every kind.’

“Bhishma continued, 

“The Brahmana said, ‘When this one doth not set any value upon good deeds, who else will? I had better go to the woods for leading a life of righteousness.’ [^780]

“Bhishma continued, 

“Kundadhara said, ‘After having worshipped me with devotion thou didst get sorrow for thy share, what then would have been the good done to thee by me, and what the value of my favour? Look, look for what end men <span id="p275"><sup><small>[ p. 275 ]</small></sup></span> desire the gratification of carnal enjoyments. The door of heaven is closed unto men.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘The Brahmana then beheld many men living in this world, embracing lust, and wrath, and cupidity, and fear, and pride, and sleep and procrastination, and inactivity.’

“Kundadhara said, ‘With these (vices) all human beings are enchained. The gods are afraid of men. These vices, at the command of the gods, mar and disconcert on every side. [^782] No man can become virtuous unless permitted by the gods. (In consequence of their permission) thou hast become competent to give away kingdoms and wealth through thy penances.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus addressed, the righteous-souled Brahmana, bending his head unto that Cloud, prostrated himself on the ground, and said, ‘Thou hast, indeed, done me a great favour. Unconscious of the great affection shown by thee towards me, I had through the influence of desire and cupidity, failed to display good will towards thee.’ Then Kundadhara said unto that foremost of regenerate persons, ‘I have forgiven thee,’ and having embraced him with his arms disappeared there and then. The Brahmana then roamed through all the worlds, having attained to ascetic success through the grace of Kundadhara. Through the puissance gained from virtue and penances, one acquires competence to sail through the skies and to fructify all one's wishes and purposes, and finally attain to the highest end. The gods and Brahmanas and Yakshas and all good men and Charanas always adore those that are virtuous but never those that are rich or given up to the indulgence of their desires. The gods are truly propitious to thee since thy mind is devoted to virtue. In wealth there may be a very little happiness but in virtue the measure of happiness is very great.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Amongst the diverse kinds of sacrifices, all of which, of course, are regarded to have but one object (_viz_., the cleansing of the heart or the glory of God), tell me, O grandsire, what that sacrifice is which has been ordained for the sake only of virtue and not for the acquisition of either heaven or wealth!’ [^783]

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection I shall relate to thee the history, formerly <span id="p276"><sup><small>[ p. 276 ]</small></sup></span> recited by Narada, of a Brahmana who for performing sacrifices, lived according to the _unchha_ mode.’

“Narada said, ‘In one of the foremost of kingdoms that was distinguished again for virtue, there lived a Brahmana. Devoted to penances and living according to the _unchha_ mode, that Brahmana was earnestly engaged in adoring Vishnu in sacrifices. [^784] He had Syamaka for his food, as also Suryaparni and Suvarchala and other kinds of potherbs that were bitter and disagreeable to the taste. In consequence, however, of his penances, all these tasted sweet. [^785] Abstaining from injuring any creature, and leading the life of a forest recluse, he attained to ascetic success. With roots and fruits, O scorcher of foes, he used to adore Vishnu in sacrifices that were intended to confer heaven upon him. [^786] The Brahmana, whose name was Satya, had a wife named Pushkaradharini. She was pure-minded, and had emaciated herself by the observance of many austere vows. (Herself having been of a benevolent disposition, and her husband being thus addicted to sacrifices that were cruel), she did not approve of the conduct of her lord. Summoned, however, to take her seat by his side as his spouse (for the performance of a sacrifice), she feared to incur his curse and, therefore, comforted herself with his conduct. The garments that invested her body consisted of the (cast off) plumes of peacocks. Although unwilling, she still performed that sacrifice at the command of her lord who had become its _Hotri_. In that forest, near to the Brahmana's asylum, lived a neighbour of his, _viz_., the virtuous Parnada of Sukra's race, having assumed the form of a deer. He addressed that Brahmana, whose name was Satya, in articulate speech and said unto him these words, ‘Thou wouldst be acting very improperly, [^787] if this sacrifice of thine were accomplished in such a manner as to be defective in _mantras_ and other particulars of ritual. I, therefore, ask thee to slay and cut me in pieces for making libations therewith on thy sacrificial fire. Do this and becoming blameless ascend to heaven.’ Then the presiding goddess of the solar disc, _viz_., Savitri, came to that sacrifice in her own embodied form and insisted upon that Brahmana in <span id="p277"><sup><small>[ p. 277 ]</small></sup></span> doing what he desired by that deer to do. Unto that goddess, however, who thus insisted, the Brahmana replied, saying, ‘I shall not slay this deer who lives with me in this same neighbourhood.’ [^788] Thus addressed by the Brahmana, the goddess Savitri desisted and entered the sacrificial fire from desire of surveying the nether world, and wishing to avoid the sight of (other) defects in that sacrifice. [^789] The deer, then, with joined hands, once more begged of Satya (to be cut in pieces and poured into the sacrificial fire). Satya, however, embraced him in friendship and dismissed him, saying, ‘Go!’ [^790] At this, the deer seemed to leave that place. But after he had gone eight steps he returned, and said, ‘Verily, do thou slay me. Truly do I say, slain by thee I am sure to attain to a righteous end. I give thee (spiritual) vision. Behold the celestial Apsaras and the beautiful vehicles of the high-souled Gandharvas.’ Beholding (that sight) for a protracted space of time, with longing eyes, and seeing the deer (solicitous of sacrifice), and thinking that residence in heaven is attainable by only slaughter, he approved (of the counsels the deer had given). It was Dharma himself who had become a deer that lived in those woods for many years. (Seeing the Brahmana tempted by the prospect he beheld), Dharma provided for his salvation and counselled him, saying, ‘This (_viz_., slaughter of living creatures) is not conformable to the ordinances about Sacrifices. [^791] The penances, which had been of very large measure, of that Brahmana whose mind had entertained the desire of slaying the deer, diminished greatly in consequence of that thought itself. The injuring of living creatures, therefore, forms no part of sacrifice. [^792] Then the illustrious Dharma (having assumed his real form), himself assisted that Brahmana, by discharging the priestly office, to perform a sacrifice. The Brahmana, after this, in consequence of his (renewed) penances, attained to that state of mind which was his spouse's. [^793] Abstention from injury is that religion which is complete in respect of its rewards. The religion, however, of cruelty is only thus far beneficial that it leads to heaven (which has a termination). I have spoken <span id="p278"><sup><small>[ p. 278 ]</small></sup></span> to thee of that religion of Truth which, indeed, is the religion of those that are utterers of _Brahma_.’” [^794]

## SECTION CCLXXIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘By what means doth a man become sinful, by what doth he achieve virtue, by what doth he attain to Renunciation, and by what doth he win Emancipation?’

“Bhishma said, ‘Thou knowest all duties. This question that thou askest is only for confirmation of thy conclusions. Listen now to Emancipation, and Renunciation, and Sin, and Virtue to their very roots. Perceiving any one of the five objects (_viz_., form, taste, scent, sound, and touch), desire runs after it at first. Indeed, obtaining them within the purview of the senses, O chief of Bharata's race, desire or aversion springs up. [^795] One, then, for the sake of that object (_i.e._, for acquisition of what is liked and avoidance of what is disliked) strives and begins acts that involve much labour. One endeavours one's best for repeatedly enjoying those forms and scents (and the three other objects of the remaining three senses) that appear very agreeable. Gradually, attachment, and aversion, and greed, and errors of judgment arise. The mind of one overwhelmed by greed and error and affected by attachment and aversion is never directed to virtue. One then begins with hypocrisy to do acts that are good. Indeed, with hypocrisy one then seeks to acquire virtue, and with hypocrisy one likes to acquire wealth. When one succeeds, O son of Kuru's race, in winning wealth with hypocrisy, one sets one's heart to such acquisition wholly. It is then that one begins to do acts that are sinful, notwithstanding the admonitions of well-wishers and the wise, unto all which he makes answers plausibly consistent with reason and conformable to the injunctions of the scriptures. Born of attachment and error, his sins, of three kinds, rapidly increase, for he thinks sinfully, speaks sinfully, and acts sinfully. When he fairly starts on the way of sin, they that are good mark his wickedness. They, however, that are of a disposition similar to that of the sinful man, enter into friendship with him. He succeeds not in winning happiness even here. Whence then would he succeed in winning happiness hereafter? It is thus that one becomes sinful. Listen now to me as I speak to thee of one that is righteous. Such a man, inasmuch as he seeks the good of others, succeeds in winning good for himself. By practising duties that are fraught with other people's good, he attains at last to a highly agreeable end. He who, aided by his wisdom, succeeds beforehand in beholding the faults <span id="p279"><sup><small>[ p. 279 ]</small></sup></span> above adverted to, who is skilled in judging of what is happiness and what is sorrow and how each is brought about, and who waits with reverence upon those that are good, makes progress in achieving virtue, both in consequence of his habit and such companionship of the good. The mind of such a person takes delight in virtue, and he lives on, making virtue his support. If he sets his heart on the acquisition of wealth, he desires only such wealth as may be acquired in righteous ways. Indeed, he waters the roots of only those things in which he sees merit. In this way, doth one become righteous and acquires friends that are good. In consequence of his acquisition of friends, of wealth, and of children, he sports in happiness both here and hereafter. The mastery (in respect of enjoyment) that a living creature attains over sound, touch, taste, form, and scent, O Bharata, represents the fruit of virtue. [^796] Remember this. Having obtained the fruit of virtue, O Yudhishthira, such a man does not give himself up to joy. Without being contented with such (visible) fruits of virtue he betakes himself to Renunciation, led on by the eye of knowledge. When, having acquired the eye of knowledge, he ceases to take pleasure in the gratification of desire, in taste and in scent, when he does not allow his mind to run towards sound, touch and form, it is then that he succeeds in freeing himself from desire. [^797] He does not, however, even then cast off virtue or righteous acts. Beholding then all the worlds to be liable to destruction, he strives to cast off virtue (with its rewards in the form of heaven and its happiness) and endeavours to attain to Emancipation by the (well-known) means. [^798] Gradually abandoning all sinful acts he betakes himself to Renunciation, and becoming righteous-souled succeeds at last in attaining to Emancipation. I have now told thee, O son, of that about which thou hadst asked me, _viz_., the topics of Sin, Righteousness, Renunciation, and Emancipation, O Bharata! Thou shouldst, therefore, O Yudhishthira, adhere to virtue in all situations. Eternal is the success, O son of Kunti, of thee that adherest to righteousness.’” [^799]


## SECTION CCLXXIV

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Thou hast said, O grandsire, the Emancipation is to be won by means and not otherwise. I desire to hear duly what those means are.’

<span id="p280"><sup><small>[ p. 280 ]</small></sup></span>

“Bhishma said, ‘O thou of great wisdom, this enquiry that thou hast addressed to me and that is connected with a subtle topic, is really worthy of thee, since thou, O sinless one, always seekest to accomplish all thy objects by the application of means. That state of mind which is present when one sets oneself to make an earthen jar for one's use, disappears after the jar has been completed. After the same manner, that cause which urges persons who regard virtue as the root of advancement and prosperity ceases to operate with them that seek to achieve Emancipation. [^800] That path which leads to the Eastern Ocean is not the path by which one can go to the Western Ocean. There is only one path that leads to Emancipation. (It is not identical with any of those that lead to any other object of acquisition). Listen to me as I discourse on it to thee in detail. One should, by practising forgiveness, exterminate wrath, and by abandoning—all purposes, root out desire. By practising the quality of _Sattwa_ [^801] one should conquer sleep. By heedfulness one should keep off fear, and by contemplation of the Soul one should conquer breath. [^802] Desire, aversion, and lust, one should dispel by patience; error, ignorance, and doubt, by study of truth. By pursuit after knowledge one should avoid _insouciance_ and inquiry after things of no interest. [^803] By frugal and easily digestible fare one should drive off all disorders and diseases. By contentment one should dispel greed and stupefaction of judgment, and all worldly concerns should be avoided by a knowledge of the truth. [^804] By practising benevolence one should conquer iniquity, and by regard for all creatures one should acquire virtue. One should avoid expectation by the reflection that it is concerned with the future; and one should cast off wealth by abandoning desire itself. The man of intelligence should abandon affection by recollecting that everything (here) is transitory. He should subdue hunger by practising Yoga. By practising benevolence one should keep off all ideas of self-importance, and drive off all sorts of craving by adopting contentment. By exertion one should subdue procrastination, and by certainty all kinds of doubt, by taciturnity, loquaciousness, and by courage, every kind of fear. [^805] Speech and mind are to be subdued by the Understanding, <span id="p281"><sup><small>[ p. 281 ]</small></sup></span> and the Understanding, in its turn, is to be kept under control by the eye of knowledge. Knowledge, again, is to be controlled by acquaintance with the Soul, and finally the Soul is to be controlled by the Soul. [^806] This last is attainable by those that are of pure-acts and endued with tranquillity of soul, [^807] the means being the subjugation of those five impediments of Yoga of which the learned speak. By casting off desire and wrath and covetousness and fear and sleep, one should, restraining speech, practise what is favourable to Yoga, _viz_., contemplation, study, gift, truth, modesty, candour, forgiveness, purity of heart, purity in respect of food, and the subjugation of the senses. By these one's energy is increased, sins are dispelled, wishes crowned with fruition, and knowledge (of diverse kinds) gained. When one becomes cleansed of one's sins and possessed of energy and frugal of fare and the master of one's senses, one then, having conquered both desire and wrath, seeks to attain to _Brahma_. The avoidance of ignorance (by listening to and studying the scriptures), the absence of attachment (in consequence of Renunciation) freedom from desire and wrath (by adoption of contentment and forgiveness), the puissance that is won by Yoga, the absence of pride and haughtiness, freedom from anxiety (by subjugation of every kind of fear), absence of attachment of anything like home and family,—these constitute the path of Emancipation. That path is delightful, stainless, and pure. Similarly, the restraining of speech, of body, and of mind, when practised from the absence of desire, constitutes also the path of Emancipation.’” [^808]


## SECTION CCLXXV

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old narrative of the discourse that took place between Narada and Asita-Devala. Once on a time Narada, beholding that foremost of intelligent men, _viz_., Devala of venerable years, <span id="p282"><sup><small>[ p. 282 ]</small></sup></span> seated at his ease, questioned him about the origin and the destruction of all creatures.’

“Narada said, ‘Whence, O Brahmana, hath this universe, consisting of mobile and immobile objects, been created? When again doth the all-embracing destruction come, into whom doth it merge? Let thy learned self discourse to me on this.’

“Asita said, ‘Those from which the Supreme Soul, when the time comes, moved by the desire of existence in manifold, forms, creates all creatures, are said by persons conversant with objects to be the five great essences. [^809] (After this) Time, impelled by the Understanding creates other objects from those (five primal essences).’ [^810] He that says that there is anything else besides these (_i.e._, the five primal essences, Kala, and the Understanding), says what is not true. Know, O Narada, that these five are eternal, indestructible, and without beginning and without end. With Kala as their sixth, these five primal essences are naturally possessed of mighty energy. Water, Space, Earth, Wind, and Heat,—these are those five essences. Without doubt, there is nothing higher or superior to these (in point of puissance or energy). The existence of nothing else (than five) can be affirmed by any one agreeably to the conclusions derivable from the _Srutis_ or arguments drawn from reason. If any one does assert the existence of anything else, then his assertion would verily be idle or vain. Know that these six enter into the production of all effects. That of which are all these (which thou perceivest) is called _Asat_. [^811] These five, and Kala (or Jiva), the potencies of past acts, and ignorance,—these eight eternal essences are the causes of the birth and destruction of all creatures. [^812] When creatures are destroyed it is into these that they enter; and when they take birth, it is again from them they do so. Indeed, after destruction, a creature resolves itself into those five primal essences. His body is made of earth; his ear has its origin in space; his eye hath light for its cause; his life (motion) is of wind, and his blood is of water, without doubt. The two eyes, the nose, the two ears, the skin, and the tongue (constituting <span id="p283"><sup><small>[ p. 283 ]</small></sup></span> the fifth), are the senses. These, the learned know, exist for perception of their respective objects. [^813] Vision, hearing, smelling, touching, and tasting are the functions of the senses. The five senses are concerned with five objects in five ways. Know, by the inference of reason, their similitude of attributes. [^814] Form, scent, taste, touch, and sound, are the five properties that are (respectively) apprehended by the five senses in five different ways. These five properties, _viz_., form, scent, taste, touch, and sound, are not really apprehended by the _senses_ (for these are inert), but it is the Soul that apprehends them _through_ the senses. That which is called Chitta is superior to the multitude of senses. Superior to Chitta is Manas. Superior to Manas is Buddhi, and superior to Buddhi is _Kshetrajna_. [^815] At first a living creature perceives different objects through the senses. With Manas he reflects over them, and then with the aid of Buddhi he arrives at certitude of knowledge. Possessed of Buddhi, one arrives at certainty of conclusions in respect of objects perceived through the senses. The five senses, Chitta, Mind and Understanding (which is the eighth in the tale),—these are regarded as organs of knowledge by those conversant with the science of Adhyatma. The hands, the feet, the anal duct, the membrum virile, the mouth (forming the fifth in the tale), constitute the five organs of action. The mouth is spoken of as an organ of action because it contains the apparatus of speech, and that of eating. The feet are organs of locomotion and the hands for doing various kinds of work. The anal duct and the membrum virile are two organs that exist for a similar purpose, _viz_., for evacuation. The first is for evacuation of stools, the second for that of urine as also of the vital seed when one feels the influence of desire. Besides these, there is a sixth organ of action. It is called muscular power. These then are the names of the six organs of action according to the (approved) treatises bearing on the subject. I have now mentioned to thee the names of all the organs of knowledge and of action, and all the attributes of the five (primal) essences. [^816] When in consequence of the organs being fatigued, they cease to perform their respective functions, the owner of those organs, because of their suspension, is said to sleep. If, when the functions of these organs are suspended, the functions of the mind do not cease, but on the other hand the mind continues to concern itself with its objects, the condition of consciousness is called Dream. During <span id="p284"><sup><small>[ p. 284 ]</small></sup></span> wakefulness there are three states of the mind, _viz_., that connected with Goodness, that with Passion, and that with Darkness. In dream also the mind becomes concerned with the same three states. Those very states, when they appear in dreams, connected with pleasurable actions, come to be regarded with applause. Happiness, success, knowledge, and absence of attachment are the indications of (the wakeful man in whom is present) the attribute of Goodness. Whatever states (of Goodness, Passion, or Darkness) are experienced by living creatures, as exhibited in acts, during their hours of Wakefulness, reappear in memory during their hours of steep when they dream. The passage of our notions as they exist during wakefulness into those of dreams, and that of notions as they exist in dreams into those of wakefulness, become directly apprehensible in that state of consciousness which is called dreamless slumber. That is eternal, and that is desirable. [^817] There are five organs of knowledge, and five of actions; with muscular power, mind, understanding, and Chitta, and with also the three attributes of _Sattwa_, _Rajas_, and _Tamas_, the tale, it has been said, comes up to seventeen. The eighteenth in the enumeration is he who owneth the body, Indeed, he who lives in this body is eternal. All those seventeen (with _Avidya_ or Ignorance making eighteen), dwelling in the body, exist attached to him who owns the body. When the owner disappears from the body, those eighteen (counting _Avidya_) cease to dwell together in the body. Or, this body made up of the five (primal) essences is only a combination (that must dissolve away). The eighteen attributes (including _Avidya_), with him that owneth the body, and counting stomachic heat numbering twentieth in the tale, form that which is known as the Combination of the Five. There is a Being called Mahat, which, with the aid of the wind (called _Prana_), upholds this combination containing the twenty things that have been named, and in the matter of the destruction of that body the wind (which is generally spoken of as the cause) is only the instrument in the hands of that same Mahat. Whatever creature is born is resolved once more into the five constituent elements upon the exhaustion of his merits and demerits; and urged again by the merits and demerits won in that life enters into another body resulting from his acts. [^818] His abodes always resulting from Avidya, desire, and acts, he migrates from body to body, abandoning one after another repeatedly, urged on by Time, like a person abandoning house after house in succession. They that are wise, and <span id="p285"><sup><small>[ p. 285 ]</small></sup></span> endued with certainty of knowledge, do not give way to grief upon beholding this (migration). Only they that are foolish, erroneously supposing relationships (where relationship in reality there is none) indulge in grief at sight of such changes of abode. This _Jiva_ is no one's relation; there is none again that may be said to belong to him. He is always alone, and he himself creates his own body and his own happiness and misery. This _Jiva_ is never born, nor doth he ever die. Freed from the bond of body, he succeeds sometimes in attaining to the highest end. Deprived of body, because freed through the exhaustion of acts from bodies that are the results of merits and demerits, Jiva at last attains to _Brahma_. For the exhaustion of both merits and demerits, Knowledge has been ordained as the cause in the Sankhya school. Upon the exhaustion of merit and demerit, when _Jiva_ attains to the status of _Brahma_, [^819] (they that are learned in the scriptures) behold (with the eye of the scriptures) the attainment of _Jiva_ to the highest end.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Cruel and sinful that we are, alas, we have slain brothers and sires and grandsons and kinsmen and friends and sons. How, O grandsire, shall we dispel this thirst for wealth. Alas, through that thirst we have perpetrated many sinful deeds.’

“Bhishma said, ”


## SECTION CCLXXVII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Time, that is fraught, with terror unto all creatures, is running his course. What is that source of good after which one should strive? Tell me this, O grandsire!’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection is cited the old narrative of a discourse between a sire and a son. Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! Once on a time, O son of Pritha, a regenerate person devoted only to the study of the Vedas had a very intelligent son who was known by the name of Medhavin. Himself conversant with the religion of Emancipation, the, son one day asked his father who was not conversant with that religion and who was engaged in following the precepts of the Vedas, this question.’

“The son said, ‘What should a man of intelligence do, O sire, knowing that the period of existence allotted to men runs fast away? Tell me this truly and in proper order, O father, so that, guided by thy instructions I may set myself to the acquisition of virtue.’

“The sire said, ‘Having studied the Vedas all the while observing the duties <span id="p287"><sup><small>[ p. 287 ]</small></sup></span> of _Brahmacharya_, O son, one should then desire for offspring for the sake of rescuing one's sires. Having established one's fire then and performing the sacrifices that are ordained, one should then retire into the woods and (having lived as a forest-recluse) one should then become a _Muni_ (by casting off everything and calmly waiting for dissolution).’

“The son said, ‘When the world is thus assailed and thus besieged on all sides, and when such irresistible (bolts) are falling in every direction, how can you speak so calmly?’

“The sire said, ‘How is the world assailed? By what is it besieged? What are those irresistible bolts that are falling on every side? Dost thou frighten me with thy words?’

“The son said, ‘The world is assailed by Death. It is besieged by what is it besieged? What are those irresistible bolts that are falling on every side? Dost thou frighten me with thy words?’

“The son said, ‘The world is assailed by Death. It is besieged by Decrepitude. Days and Nights are continually falling (like bolts). Why do you not take heed of these? When I know that Death does not wait here for any one (but snatches all away suddenly and without notice), how can I possibly wait (for his coming) thus enveloped in a coat of Ignorance and (heedlessly) attending to my concerns? When as each night passes away the period of every one's life wears away with it, when, indeed, one's position is similar to that of a fish in a piece of shallow water, who can feel happy? Death encounters one in the very midst of one's concerns, before the attainment of one's objects, finding one as unmindful as a person while engaged in plucking flowers. [^823] That which is kept for being done tomorrow should be done today; and that which one thinks of doing in the afternoon should be done in the forenoon. Death does not wait, mindful of one's having done or not done one's acts. Do today what is for thy good (without keeping it for tomorrow). See that Death, who is irresistible, may not overcome thee (before you accomplish thy acts). Who knows that Death will not come to one this very day? Before one's acts are completed, Death drags one away. One should, therefore, commence to practise virtue while one is still young (without waiting for one's old age). for life is uncertain. By acquiring virtue one is sure to eternal happiness both here and hereafter. Overpowered by folly one girds up one's loins for acting on behalf of one's sons and wives. By accomplishing acts foul or fair, one gratifies these (relatives). Him possessed of sons and animals, and with mind devotedly attached to them, Death seizes and runs away like a tiger bearing away a sleeping deer. [^824] While one is still engaged <span id="p288"><sup><small>[ p. 288 ]</small></sup></span> in winning diverse objects of desire, and while still unsatiated with one's enjoyment, Death seizes one and runs away like a she-wolf seizing a sheep and running away with it. ‘_This has been done_’,—‘_this remains to be done_’,—‘_this other is half done_’,—one may say thus to oneself; but Death, unmindful of one's desire to finish one's unfinished acts, seizes and drags one away. One that has not yet obtained the fruit of what one has already done, amongst those attached to action, one busied with one's field or shop or house, Death seizes and carries away. The weak, the strong; the wise, the brave, the idiotic, the learned, or him that has not yet obtained the gratification of any of his desires, Death seizes and bears away. Death, decrepitude, disease, sorrow, and many things of a similar kind, are incapable of being avoided by mortals. How, then, O father, canst thou sit so at thy ease? As soon as a creature is born, Decrepitude and Death come and possess him for his destruction. All these forms of existence mobile and immobile, are possessed by these two (_viz_., Decrepitude and Death). When the soldiers that compose Death's army are on their march, nothing can resist them, except that one thing, _viz_., the power of Truth, for in Truth alone Immortality dwells. The delight that one feels of residing in the midst of men is the abode of Death. The _Sruti_ declares that that which is called the forest is the true fold for the _Devas_, while the delight one feels in dwelling in the midst of men is, as it were, the cord for binding the dweller (and making him helpless). [^825] The righteous cut it and escape. The sinful do not succeed in cutting it (and freeing themselves). He who does not injure other creatures in thought, word and deed, and who never injures others by taking away their means of sustenance, is never injured by any creature. [^826] For these reasons, one should practise the vow of truth, be steadily devoted to the vow of truth, and should desire nothing but the truth. Restraining all one's senses and looking upon all creatures with an equal eye, one should vanquish Death with the aid of Truth. Both Immortality and Death are planted in the body. Death is encountered from folly, and Immortality is won by Truth. Transcending desire and wrath, and abstaining from injury, I shall adopt Truth and happily achieving what is for my good, avoid Death like an Immortal. Engaged in the Sacrifice that is constituted by Peace, and employed also in the Sacrifice of _Brahma_, and restraining my senses, the Sacrifices I shall perform are those of speech, mind, and acts, when the sun enters his northerly course. [^827] How can one like me perform an Animal Sacrifice which is fraught with cruelty? <span id="p289"><sup><small>[ p. 289 ]</small></sup></span> How can one like me, that is possessed of wisdom, perform like a cruel Pisacha, a Sacrifice of Slaughter after the manner of what is laid down for the Kshatriyas,—a Sacrifice that is, besides, endued with rewards that are terminable? In myself have I been begotten by my own self. O father, without seeking to procreate offspring, I shall rest myself on my own self. I shall perform the Sacrifice of Self, I need no offspring to rescue me. [^828] He whose words and thoughts are always well-restrained, he who has Penances and Renunciation, and Yoga, is sure to attain to everything through these. There is no eye equal to Knowledge. There is no reward equal to Knowledge. There is no sorrow equal to attachment. There is no happiness equal to Renunciation. For a Brahmana there can be no wealth like residence in solitude, an equal regard for all creatures, truthfulness of speech, steady observance of good conduct, the total abandonment of the rod (of chastisement), simplicity, and the gradual abstention from all acts. [^829] What need hast thou with wealth and what need with relatives and friends, and what with spouses? Thou art a Brahmana and thou hast death to encounter. Search thy own Self that is concealed in a cave. Whither have thy grandsires gone and whither thy sire too?' [^830]

“Bhishma said, ‘Hearing these words of his son, the sire acted in the way that was pointed out, O king! Do thou also act in the same way, devoted to the religion of Truth.’”


## SECTION CCLXXVIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Of what behaviour must a man be, of what acts, of what kind of knowledge, and to what must he be devoted, for attaining to Brahma's place which transcends Prakriti and which is unchangeable?’

“Bhishma said, ‘One that is devoted to the religion of Emancipation, frugal in fare, and the master of one's senses, attains to that high place which transcends Prakriti and is unchangeable. [^831] Retiring from one's home, regarding gain and loss in the same light, restraining the senses, and disregarding all objects of desire even when they are ready (for enjoyment), one should adopt a life of Renunciation. [^832] Neither with eye, nor with word, nor in <span id="p290"><sup><small>[ p. 290 ]</small></sup></span> thought, should one disparage another. Nor should one speak evil of any person either in or out of his hearing. One should abstain from injuring any creature, and conduct oneself observing the course of the Sun. [^833] Having come into this life, one should not behave with unfriendliness towards any creature. One should disregard opprobrious speeches, and never in arrogance deem oneself as superior to another. When sought to be angered by another, one should still utter agreeable speeches. Even when calumniated, one should not calumniate in return. One should not behave in a friendly or an unfriendly way in the midst of human beings. One should not go about visiting many houses in one's round of mendicancy. Nor should one go to any house having received a previous invitation (to dinner). [^834] Even when bespattered with filth (by others), one should, resting firmly in the observance of one's duties, refrain from addressing such bespatterers in disagreeable speeches. One should be compassionate. One should abstain from returning an injury. One should be fearless; one should refrain from self-laudation. The man of restrained senses should seek his dole of charity in a householder's abode when the smoke has ceased to rise from it, when the sound of the husking rod is hushed, when the hearth-fire is extinguished, when all the inmates have finished their meals, or when the hour is over for setting the dishes. [^835] He should content himself with only as much as is barely necessary for keeping body and soul together. Even that much of food which produces gratification should not be coveted by him. When he fails to obtain what he wants, he should not suffer himself to cherish discontent. Success, again, in obtaining what he wants, should not make him glad. [^836] He should never wish for such things as are coveted by ordinary men. He should never eat at anybody's <span id="p291"><sup><small>[ p. 291 ]</small></sup></span> house when respectfully invited thereto. One like him should reprobate such gains as are obtained with honour. [^837] He should never find fault (on account of staleness, etc.) with the food placed before him, nor should he applaud its merits. He should covet a bed and a seat that are removed from the haunts of men. The places he should seek are such as a deserted house, the foot of a tree, a forest, or a cave. Without allowing his practices to be known by others, or concealing their real nature by appearing to adopt others (that are hateful or repulsive), he should enter his own Self. [^838] By association with Yoga and dissociation from company, he should be perfectly equable, steadily fixed, and uniform. He should not earn either merit or demerit by means of acts. [^839] He should be always gratified, well-contented, of cheerful face and cheerful senses, fearless, always engaged in mental recitation of sacred _mantras_, silent, and wedded to a life of Renunciation. Beholding the repeated formation and dissolution of his own body with the senses that result from and resolve into the elemental essences, and seeing also the advent and departure of (other) creatures, he should become free from desire and learn to cast equal eyes upon all, subsisting upon both cooked and uncooked food. Frugal in respect of his fare, and subjugating his senses, he achieves tranquillity of Self by Self. [^840] One should control the (rising) impulses of words, of the mind, of wrath, of envy, of hunger, and of lust. Devoted to penances for cleansing his heart, he should never allow the censures (of others) to afflict his heart. One should live, having assumed a status of neutrality with respect to all creatures, and regard praise and blame as equal. This, indeed, is the holiest and the highest path of the Sannyasa mode of life. Possessed of high soul, the Sannyasin should restrain his senses from all things and keep himself aloof from all attachments. He should never repair to the places visited by him and the men known to him while leading the prior modes of life. Agreeable to all creatures, and without a fixed home, he should be devoted to the contemplation of Self. He should never mingle with house-holders and forest-recluses. He should eat such food as he may obtain without effort (and without having thought of it beforehand). [^841] He should never suffer joy to possess <span id="p292"><sup><small>[ p. 292 ]</small></sup></span> his heart. To those that are wise such a life of Renunciation is the means for the attainment of Emancipation. To those, however, that are fools the practice of these duties is exceedingly burthensome. The sage Harita declared all this to be the path by which Emancipation is to be achieved. He who sets forth from his home, having assured all creatures of his perfect harmlessness, attains to many bright regions of felicity which prove unending or eternal.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘All men speak of ourselves as highly fortunate. In truth, however, there is no person more wretched than ourselves. Though honoured by all the world, O best of the Kurus, and though we have been born among men, O grandsire, having been begotten by the very gods, yet when so much sorrow has been our lot, it seems, O reverend chief, that birth alone in an embodied form is the cause of all sorrow. Alas, when shall we adopt a life of Renunciation that is destructive of sorrow? [^842] Sages of rigid vows freed from the seven and ten (_i.e._, the five breaths, mind, understanding, and the ten organs of knowledge and action), from the five faults of Yoga (_viz_., desire, wrath, covetousness, fear, and sleep) that constitute the chief causes (for binding man to repeated rounds of earthly life), and from the other eight, _viz_., the five objects of the senses and the three attributes (of _Sattwa_, _Rajas_, and _Tamas_), have never to incur rebirth. When, O scorcher of foes, shall we succeed in abandoning sovereignty for adopting a life of renunciation?’

“Bhishma said, ‘Everything, O great monarch, hath an end. Everything hath bounds assigned to it. Even rebirth, it is well-known, hath an end. In this world there is nothing that is, immutable. Thou thinkest, O king, that this (_viz_., the affluence with which thou art invested is a fault). That it is not so is not true, in regard to our present topic of disquisition. Ye, however, are conversant with virtue, and have readiness. It is certain, therefore, that ye shall attain to the end of your sorrow, (_viz_., Emancipation) in time. [^843] Jiva equipped with body, O king, is not the author of his merits and demerits (or their fruits as represented by happiness and misery). On the other hand, he becomes enveloped by the Darkness (of Ignorance having attachment and <span id="p293"><sup><small>[ p. 293 ]</small></sup></span> aversion for its essence) that is born of his merits and demerits. [^844] As the wind impregnated with dust of antimony once again seizes the efflorescence of realgar and (though itself destitute of colour) assumes the hues of the substances which it has seized and tinges the different points of the compass (which represent its own hueless progenitor, _viz_., space), after the same manner, Jiva, though himself colourless, assumes a hue in consequence of being enveloped by Darkness and variegated by the fruits of action, and travels from body to body (making his own stainless and immutable progenitor appear as stained and changeful). [^845] When Jiva succeeds in dispelling by means of Knowledge, the Darkness that invests him in consequence of Ignorance, then Immutable Brahma becomes displayed (in all His glory). The Sages say that reversion to Immutable Brahma is incapable of being achieved by Acts. Thyself, others in the world, and the deities too, should reverence them that have achieved Emancipation. All the great _Rishis_ never desist from culture of Brahma. [^846] In this connection is cited that discourse which was sung (by the preceptor of the Daityas) in days of old. Listen, O monarch, with undivided attention to the course of conduct that was followed by the Daitya Vritra after he became divested of all his prosperity. Depending only upon his intelligence, he did not indulge in sorrow, in the midst of his enemies, although he was deprived of sovereignty, O Bharata! Unto Vritra, when in days of old he was reft of sovereignty, (his preceptor) Usanas said, ‘I hope, O Danava, that in consequence of thy defeat thou dost not cherish any grief?’

“Vritra said, ‘Without doubt, having understood, by the aid of truth and penances, the advent and departure of all living creatures, I have ceased to indulge in either grief or joy. Urged by Time creatures sink helplessly in hell. Some again, the sages say, go to heaven. All these pass their time in contentment. Passing their allotted periods in heaven and hell, and with some portion <span id="p294"><sup><small>[ p. 294 ]</small></sup></span> of their merits and demerits unexhausted (by enjoyment and suffering), they repeatedly take birth, impelled by Time. Chained by the bonds of Desire, creatures pass through myriads of intermediate life and fall helplessly into hell. [^847] I have seen that creatures come and go even thus. The lesson inculcated in the Scriptures is that one's acquisitions correspond with one's acts. [^848] Creatures take birth as men or as intermediate animals or as gods and go to hell. Having acted in lives, that are past in such a way as to deserve them, all creatures, subject to the ordinances of the Destroyer, meet with happiness and misery, the agreeable and the disagreeable. Having enjoyed the measure of weal or woe that corresponds with their acts, creatures always come back by the old path, [^849] which is measured by the measure of acts.’ Then the illustrious Usanas addressed the _Asura_ Vritra who was thus talking of the highest refuge of the creation, saying, ‘O intelligent Daitya, why, O child, dost thou utter such foolish rhapsodies?’

“Vritra said, ‘The severe penances which I underwent from greed of victory are well-known to thee as also to other sages. Appropriating diverse scents and diverse kinds of tastes that other creatures had for enjoying, I swelled up with my own energy, afflicting the three worlds. Decked with myriads of effulgent rays I used to rove through the skies (on my celestial car), incapable of being defeated by any creature and fearing none. I achieved great prosperity through my penances and lost it again through my own acts. Relying on my fortitude, however, I do not grieve for this change. Desirous (in days of yore) of fighting the great Indra, the high-souled ruler of the heavens, I beheld in that battle the illustrious Hari, the puissant Narayana. [^850] He who is called Vaikuntha, Purusha, Ananta, Sukla, Vishnu, Sanatana, Munjakesa, Harismasru, and the Grandsire of all creatures. [^851] Without doubt, there is still a remnant (to be enjoyed by me) of the rewards attaching to that penance represented by a sight of the great Hari. It is in consequence of that unexhausted remnant that I have become desirous of asking thee, O illustrious one, about the fruits of action! [^852] Upon which order (of men) hath <span id="p295"><sup><small>[ p. 295 ]</small></sup></span> been established high Brahma prosperity? In what mariner, again, doth high prosperity fall off? From whom do creatures spring and live? Through whom again do they act? What is that high Fruit by attaining to which a creature succeeds in living eternally as Brahma? By what Act or by what Knowledge can that fruit be achieved? It behoveth thee, O learned Brahmana, to expound these to me.’

“Recapitulated by me, O lion among kings, listen with undivided attention, O bull of men, with all thy brothers, to what the sage Usanas then said after he had been thus addressed by that prince of Danavas.’”

## SECTION CCLXXX

“Usanas said, ‘I bow to that divine and illustrious and puissant Being who holds this earth with the firmament in his arms. I shall speak to thee of the pre-eminent greatness of that Vishnu whose head, O best of the _Danavas_, is that Infinite place (called Emancipation).’

“While they were thus conversing with each other there came unto them the great sage Sanatkumara of righteous soul for the purpose of dispelling their doubts. Worshipped by the prince of _Asuras_ and by the sage Usanas, that foremost of sages sat down on a costly seat. After Kumara of great wisdom had been seated (at his ease), Usanas said unto him, ‘Discourse to this chief of the _Danavas_ on the pre-eminent greatness of Vishnu.’ Hearing these words, Sanatkumara uttered the following, fraught with grave import, upon the pre-eminent greatness of Vishnu unto the intelligent chief of the _Danavas_, ‘Listen, O Daitya, to everything about the greatness of Vishnu. Know, O scorcher of foes, that the entire universe rests on Vishnu. O thou of mighty arms, it is He who creates all creatures mobile and immobile. In course of Time it is He, again, who withdraws all things and in Time it is He who once more casts them forth from Himself. Into Hari all things merge at the universal destruction and from Him all things again come forth. Men possessed of scriptural lore cannot obtain him by such lore. Nor can He be obtained by Penances, nor by Sacrifices. The only means by which He can be attained is by restraining the Senses. Nor that sacrifices are entirely useless towards such an end. For one, by relying upon both external and internal acts, and upon one's own mind, can purify (them) by one's own understanding. By such means, one succeeds in enjoying infinity in the world. [^853] As <span id="p296"><sup><small>[ p. 296 ]</small></sup></span> a goldsmith purifies the dross of his metal by repeatedly casting it into the fire with very persistent efforts of his own, after the same manner Jiva succeeds in cleaning himself by his course through hundreds of births. Some one may be seen to purify himself in only one life by mighty efforts. As one should with care wipe stains from off one's person before they become thick, after the same manner one should, with vigorous efforts, wash off one's faults. [^854] By mixing only a few flowers with them, grains of sesame cannot be made to cast off their own odour (and become at once fragrant). After the same manner, one cannot, by cleansing one's heart only a little, succeed in beholding the Soul. When, however, those grains are perfumed repeatedly with the aid of a large quantity of flowers, it is then that they cast off their own odour and assume that of the flowers with which they are mixed. After this manner, faults, in the form of attachments to all our environments, are dispelled by the understanding in course of many lives, with the aid of a large dose of the attribute of the _Sattwa_, and by means of efforts born of practice. [^855] Listen, O Danava, by what means creatures attached to acts and those unattached to them attain the causes that lead to their respective states of mind. [^856] Listen to me with undivided attention. I shall, in their due order, discourse to thee, O puissant Danava, as to how creatures betake themselves to action and how they give up action. [^857] The Supreme Lord creates all creatures mobile and immobile. He is without beginning and without end. Unendued with attributes of any kind, he assumes attributes (when he chooses to create). He is the universal Destroyer, the Refuge of all things, the Supreme Ordainer, and pure Chit. [^858] In all creatures it is He who dwells as the mutable and the immutable. It is He who, having eleven modifications for His essence, drinketh this universe with His rays. [^859] Know that the Earth is His feet. His head is constituted by Heaven. His arms, O Daitya, are the several points of the compass or the horizon. The intermediate space is His ears. The light of His eye is the Sun, and His mind is in the Moon. His understanding dwells <span id="p297"><sup><small>[ p. 297 ]</small></sup></span> always in Knowledge, and His tongue is in Water. [^860] O best of Danavas, the Planets are in the midst of His brows. The starts and constellations are from the light of His eyes. The Earth is in His feet. O Danava! Know also that the attributes of _Rajas_, _Tamas_, and _Sattwa_ are of Him. He is the fruit (or end) of all the modes of life, and He it is who should be known as the fruit (or reward) of all (pious) acts (such as Japa and Sacrifice, etc.). [^861] The Highest and Immutable, He is also the fruit of abstention from all work. The _Chandas_ are the hair on His body, and _Akshara_ (or _Pranava_) is His word. The diverse orders (of men) and the modes of life are His refuge. His mouths are many. Duty (or religion) is planted in his heart. He is Brahma; He is the highest Righteousness; He is _Sat_ and He is _Asat_; [^862] He is Sruti; He is the scriptures; He is the Sacrificial vessel; He is the six and ten Ritwijes; He is all the Sacrifices; He is the Grandsire (Brahman); He is Vishnu; He is the twin Aswins; and He is Purandara; [^863] He is Mitra; He is Varuna; He is Yama; He is Kuvera the lord of treasures. Although the Ritwijes seem to behold Him as separate, He is, however, known to them as one and the same. Know that this entire universe is under the control of One divine Being. [^864] The Veda that is in the soul, O prince of _Daityas_, regards the unity of various creatures. When a living creature realises this unity in consequence of true knowledge, he is then said to attain to Brahma. The period of time for which one creation exists or for which if ceases to exist is called a _Kalpa_. Living creatures exist for a thousand millions of such Kalpas. Immobile creatures also exist for an equal period. The period for which a particular creation exists is measured by many thousands of lakes (in the following way), O Daitya! Conceive a lake that is one _Yojana_ in width, one _Krosa_ in depth, and five hundred _Yojanas_ in length. Imagine many thousands of such lakes. Seek then to dry up those lakes by taking from them, only once a day, as much water as may be taken up with the end of a single hair. The number of days would pass in drying them up completely by this process represents the period that is occupied by the life of one creation from its first start to the time of its destruction. [^865] The highest Evidence (for all things) says that creatures have six colours, _viz_., Dark, Tawny, Blue, Red, Yellow, and White. These colours proceed from mixtures in various proportions of the three attributes of Rajas, Tamas, and Sattwa. Where Tamas predominates, Sattwa falls below the mark, and Rajas keeps to <span id="p298"><sup><small>[ p. 298 ]</small></sup></span> the mark, the result is the colour called Dark. When Tamas predominates as before, but the relations between Sattwa and Rajas are reversed, the result is the colour called Tawny. When Rajas predominates, Sattwa falls below the mark, and Tamas keeps to the mark, the result is the colour called Blue. When Rajas predominates as before and the proportion is reversed between Sattwa and Tamas, the result is the intermediate colour called Red. That Colour is more agreeable (than the preceding one). When Sattwa predominates, Rajas falls below the mark and, Tamas keeps to the mark, the result is the colour called Yellow. It is productive of happiness. When Sattwa predominates and the proportion is reversed between Rajas and Tamas, the result is the colour called White. It is productive of great happiness. [^866] The White is the foremost colour. It is sinless in consequence of its being free from attachment and aversion. It is without grief, and free from the toil involved in _Pravritti_. Hence, White, O prince of _Danavas_, leads to success (or Emancipation). Jiva, O Daitya, having undergone thousands of births derived through the womb, attains to success. [^867] That success is the identical end which the divine Indra declared after having studied many auspicious spiritual treatises and which has for its essence the apprehension of the Soul. The end again that creatures obtain is dependent oil their colour, and colour, in its turn, depends upon the character of the Time that sets in, O Daitya! [^868] The stages of existence, O Daitya, through which Jiva must pass are not unlimited. They are fourteen hundreds of thousands ill number. In consequence of them Jiva ascends, stays, and falls down as the case may be. [^869] The end that is attained by a Jiva of dark flue is very low, for he becomes addicted to acts that lead to hell and then has to rot in hell. [^870] The learned say that in consequence of his wickedness, the continuance (in such form) of a Jiva is measured <span id="p299"><sup><small>[ p. 299 ]</small></sup></span> by many thousands of Kalpas. [^871] Having passed many hundred thousands of years in that condition, Jiva then attains to the colour called Tawny (and becomes born as an intermediate creature). In that condition he dwells (for many long years), in perfect helplessness. At last when his sins are exhausted (in consequence of his having endured all the misery they are capable of bringing), his mind, casting off all attachments, cherishes Renunciation. [^872] When Jiva becomes endued with the quality of Sattwa, he then dispels everything connected with Tamas by the aid of his intelligence, and exerts (for achieving what is for his good). As the result of this, Jiva attains to the colour called Red. If the quality of Sattwa, however, be not gained, Jiva then travels in a round of rebirths in the world of inert, having attained to the colour called Blue. [^873] Having attained to that end (_viz_., Humanity) and having been afflicted for the duration of one creation by the bonds born of his own acts, Jiva then attains to the colours called Yellow (or becomes a Deity). Existing in that condition for the space of a hundred creations, he then leaves it (for becoming a human being) to return to it once more. [^874] Having attained to the Yellow colour, Jiva exists for thousands of Kalpas, sporting as a Deva. Without, however, being emancipated (even then), he has to stay in hell, enjoying or enduring the fruits of his acts of past Kalpas and wandering through nine and ten thousand courses. [^875] Know that Jiva becomes freed from the hell (of acts) as represented by heaven or godship. After the same manner, Jiva gets, off from the other births (corresponding with the other colours). Jiva sports for many long Kalpas in the world of Devas. Falling thence, he once more obtains the status of Humanity. He then stays in that condition for the space of a hundred and eight Kalpas. He then attains once more to the status of a Deva. If while in the status of humanity (for the second time) he falleth through (evil acts as represented by) <span id="p300"><sup><small>[ p. 300 ]</small></sup></span> Kala (in the form of Kali), he then sinks into the Dark colour and thus occupies the very lowest of all stages of existence.

“I shall tell thee now, O foremost of _Asuras_, how Jiva succeeds in effecting his Emancipation. Desirous of Emancipation, Jiva, relying upon seven hundred kinds of acts every one of which is characterised by a predominance of the attribute of _Sattwa_, gradually courses through Red and Yellow and at last attains to White. Arrived here, Jiva travels through several regions that are most adorable and that have the Eight well-known regions of felicity beneath them, and all the while pursues that stainless and effulgent form of existence which is Emancipation's self. [^876] Know that the Eight (already referred to and) which are identical with the Sixty (subdivided into) hundreds, are, unto those that are highly effulgent, only creations of the mind (without having any real or independent existence). The highest object of acquisition with one that is White of hue, is that condition (called _Turiya_) which transcends the three other states of consciousness, _viz_., Wakefulness and Dream and Dreamless slumber. [^877] As regards that Yogin who is unable to abandon the felicities that Yoga-puissance brings about, he has to dwell (in one and the same body) for one century of Kalpas in auspiciousness and after that in four other regions (called Mahar, Jana, Tapas, and Satya). Even that is the highest end of one belonging to the sixth colour, and who is Unsuccessful <span id="p301"><sup><small>[ p. 301 ]</small></sup></span> though crowned with success, and who has transcended all attachments and passions. [^878] That Yogin, again, who falls off from Yoga practices after having attained the measure of eminence described already resides in heaven for a century of Kalpas with the, unexhausted remnant of his past acts (to be exhausted by enjoyment or endurance as the case may be), and with the seven (_viz_., the five senses of knowledge and mind and understanding) purged of all stains in consequence of their predisposition or proneness towards the attribute of Sattwa. And the expiry of that period, such a person has to come to the world of men where he attains to great eminence. [^879] Turning back from the world of men, he departs for attaining to new forms of existence that run higher and higher in the upward scale. While engaged in this, he courseth through seven regions for seven times, his puissance being always increased in consequence of his Samadhi and the re-awakening from it. [^880] The Yogin who is desirous of final Emancipation suppresses by Yoga-knowledge the seven, and continues to dwell in the world of life, freed from attachments; and taking those seven for certain means of grief, he casts them off and attains afterwards to that state which is Indestructible and Infinite. Some say that <span id="p302"><sup><small>[ p. 302 ]</small></sup></span> that is the region of Mahadeva; some, of Vishnu; some, of Brahman; some, of Sesha; some, of Nara; some, of the effulgent Chit; and some, of the All-pervading. [^881] When universal destruction comes, those persons who have succeeded in completely consuming by Knowledge their gross and subtle and karana bodies, always enter into Brahma. All their Senses also which have action for their essence and which are not identical with Brahma, merge into the same. When the time of universal destruction comes, those Jivas who have attained to the position of Devas and who have an unexhausted remnant of the fruits of acts to enjoy or endure, revert to those stages of life in the subsequent Kalpa which had been theirs in the previous one. This is due to the similarity of every successive Kalpa to every previous one. Those again whose acts, at the time of universal destruction, have been exhausted by enjoyment or endurance in respect of their fruits, falling down from heaven, take birth among men, in the subsequent Kalpa, for without Knowledge one cannot destroy one's acts in even a hundred Kalpas. All superior Beings again, endued with similar powers and similar forms, revert to their respective destinies at a new creation after a universal destruction, ascending and descending precisely in the same manner as during the creation that is dissolved. [^882] As regards, again, the person who is conversant with Brahma, as long as he continues to enjoy and endure the unexhausted remnant of his acts of previous Kalpas, it is said that all creatures and the two stainless sciences live in his body. When his Chitta becomes cleansed by Yoga, and when he practises Samyama, this perceptible universe appears to him as only his own fivefold senses. [^883] Enquiring with a cleansed mind, Jiva attains to a high and stainless end. Thence he attains to a spot which knows no deterioration, <span id="p303"><sup><small>[ p. 303 ]</small></sup></span> and thence attains to eternal Brahma that is so difficult of acquisition. [^884] Thus, Of thou of great might, I have discoursed to thee of the eminence of Narayana!’

“Vritra said, ‘These words of thine, I see, perfectly according with the truth. Indeed, when this is so, I have no (cause of grief). Having listened to thy words, O thou of great powers of mind, I have become freed from sorrow and sin of every kind. O illustrious _Rishi_, O holy one, I see this wheel of Time, endued with mighty energy, of the most effulgent and Infinite Vishnu, has been set in motion. Eternal is that station, from which all kinds of creation spring. That Vishnu is the Supreme Soul. He is the foremost of Beings. In Him this entire universe rests.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Having said these words, O son of Kunti, Vritra cast off his life-breaths, uniting his soul (in Yoga, with the supreme Soul), and attained to the highest station.’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, whether this Janardana (Krishna) is that illustrious and puissant Lord of whom Sanatkumara spoke unto Vritra in days of old.’

“Bhishma said, ‘The Highest Deity, endued with the six attributes of (puissance, etc.) is at the Root. Staying there, the Supreme Soul, with his own energy, creates all these diverse existent things. [^885] Know that this Kesava who knows no deterioration is from His eighth portion. Endued with the highest Intelligence, it is this Kesava who creates the three worlds with an eighth portion (of His energy). Coming immediately after Him who lies at the Root, this Kesava who is eternal (compared with all other existent things), changes at the end of each Kalpa. He, however, who lies at the Root and who is endued with supreme might and puissance, lies in the waters when universal destruction comes (in the form of the potential Seed of all things). Kesava is that Creator of pure Soul who courseth through all the eternal worlds. [^886] Infinite and Eternal as He is, He fills all space (with emanations from Himself) and courseth through the universe (in the form of everything that constitutes the universe). Freed as He is from limitations of every kind such as the possession of attributes would imply, he suffers himself to be invested <span id="p304"><sup><small>[ p. 304 ]</small></sup></span> with Avidya and awakened to Consciousness, Kesava of Supreme Soul creates all things. In Him rests this wondrous universe in its entirety.’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘O thou that art conversant with the highest object of knowledge, I think that Vritra saw beforehand the excellent end that awaited him. It is for this, O grandsire, that he was happy and did not yield to grief (in view of his coming Death). He who is White of hue, who has taken birth in a pure or stainless race, and who has attained to the rank of a Sadhya, doth not, O sinless one, come back (into the world for re-birth). Such a person, O grandsire, is freed from both hell and the status of all intermediate creatures. He, however, who has attained to either the Yellow or the Red hue, is seen sometimes to be overwhelmed by Tamas and fall among the order of Intermediate creatures. As regards ourselves, we are exceedingly afflicted and attached to objects that are productive of sorrow or indifference or joy. Alas, what will the end be to which we shall attain? Will it be the Blue or the Dark which is the lowest of all hues?’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Ye are Pandavas. Ye have been born in a stainless race. Ye are of rigid vows. Having sported in joy in the regions of the gods, ye shall come back to the world of men. Living happily as long as the creation lasts, all of you at the next new creation will be admitted among the gods, and enjoying all kinds of felicities ye will at last be numbered among the Siddhas. Let no fear be yours. Be you cheerful.’”

## SECTION CCLXXXI

“Yudhishthira said, ‘How great was the love of virtue possessed by Vritra of immeasurable energy, whose knowledge was incomparable and whose devotion to Vishnu was so great. The status occupied by Vishnu of immeasurable energy is exceedingly difficult of apprehension. How, O tiger among kings, could Vritra (who was an Asura) comprehended it (so well)? Thou hast spoken of Vritra's acts. I too have listened to thee in full faith. In consequence, however, of my seeing that one point (in thy discourse) is unintelligible (and that, therefore, it requires explanation), my curiosity has been roused for questioning thee again. [^887] How, indeed, was Vritra, who was virtuous, devoted to Vishnu, endued with knowledge of truth derivable from a just comprehension of the _Upanishads_ and _Vedanta_, vanquished by Indra, O foremost of men? O chief of the Bharatas, resolve me this doubt. Indeed, tell me, O tiger among kings, how Vritra was vanquished by Sakra! [^888] O <span id="p305"><sup><small>[ p. 305 ]</small></sup></span> grandsire, O thou of mighty arms, tell me in detail how the battle took place (between the chief of the deities and the foremost of _Asuras_). My curiosity to hear it is very great.’

Bhishma said, ‘In days of yore, Indra, accompanied by the celestial forces, proceeded on his car, and beheld the _Asura_ Vritra stationed before him like a mountain. He was full five hundred Yojanas in height, O chastiser of foes, and three hundred Yojanas in circumference. Beholding that form of Vritra, which was incapable of being vanquished by the three worlds united together, the celestial became penetrated with fear and full of anxiety. Indeed, suddenly seeing that gigantic form of his antagonist, O king, Indra was struck with palsy in the lower extremities. Then, on the eve of that great battle between the deities and the _Asuras_, there arose loud shouts from both sides, and drums and other musical instruments began to beat and blow. Beholding Sakra stationed before him, O thou of Kuru's race, Vritra felt neither awe nor fear, nor was he disposed to muster all his energies for the fight. [^889] Then the encounter commenced, inspiring the three worlds with terror, between Indra, the chief of the deities, and Vritra of high soul. The entire welkin was enveloped by the combats of both sides with swords and axes and lances and darts and spears and heavy clubs and rocks of diverse sizes and bows of loud twang and diverse kinds of celestial weapons and fires and burning brands. All the celestials with Grandsire at their head, and all the highly-blessed _Rishis_, came to witness the battle, on their foremost of cars; and the _Siddhas_ also, O bull of Bharata's race, and the _Gandharvas_, with the Apsaras, on their own beautiful and foremost of cars, came there (for the same purpose). Then Vritra, that foremost of virtuous persons, quickly overwhelmed the welkin and the chief of the deities with a thick shower of rocks. The celestials, at this, filled with rage, dispelled with their showers of arrows that thick downpour of rocks showered by Vritra in battle. Then Vritra, O tiger among the Kurus, possessed of mighty strength and endued with large powers of illusion, stupefied the chief of the deities by fighting wholly with the aid of his powers of illusion. When he of a hundred sacrifices, thus afflicted by Vritra. was overcome by stupefaction, the sage Vasishtha restored him to his senses by uttering _Somanas_.’ [^890]

“Vasishtha said, ‘Thou art the foremost of the gods, O chief of the deities, O slayer of _Daityas_ and _Asuras_! The strength of the three worlds is in thee! Why, then, O Sakra, dost thou languish so! There, Brahman, and Vishnu, and Siva, that lord of the universe, the illustrious and divine Soma, and all the highest _Rishis_ (stand, beholding thee)! Do not, O Sakra, yield to weakness, like an ordinary person! Firmly resolved on battle, slay thy foes, O chief of the celestials! There, that Master of all the worlds, _viz_., the Three-eyed (Siva), the adored of all the worlds, is eyeing thee! Cast off this stupefaction, O chief of the celestials! There, those regenerate _Rishis_, headed by <span id="p306"><sup><small>[ p. 306 ]</small></sup></span> Vrihaspati, are praising thee, for thy victory, in celestial hymns.’ [^891]

“Bhishma continued, ‘While Vasava of great energy was thus being restored to consciousness by the high-souled Vasishtha, his strength became greatly enhanced. The illustrious chastiser of Paka then, relying upon his intelligence, had recourse to high Yoga and with its aid dispelled these illusions of Vritra. Then Vrihaspati, the son of Angiras, and those foremost of _Rishis_ possessed of great prosperity, beholding the prowess of Vritra, repaired to Mahadeva, and impelled by the desire of benefiting the three worlds, urged him to destroy the great _Asura_. The energy of that illustrious lord of the universe thereupon assumed the character of a fierce fever and penetrated the body of Vritra the lord of _Asuras_. [^892] The illustrious and divine Vishnu, adored of all the worlds, bent upon protecting the universe, entered the thunderbolt of Indra. Then Vrihaspati of great intelligence and Vasishtha of exceeding energy, and all the other foremost of _Rishis_, repairing to Him of a hundred sacrifices, _viz_., the boon-giving Vasava, the adored of all the worlds, addressed him, saying, ‘Slay Vritra, O puissant one, without delay!’

“Maheswara said, ‘Yonder, O Sakra, stands the great Vritra, accompanied by a great force. He is the soul of the universe, capable of going everywhere, endued with large powers of illusion, and possessed of great celebrity. This foremost of _Asuras_ is, therefore, incapable of being vanquished by even the three worlds united together. Aided by Yoga, do thou slay him, O chief of the deities. Do not disregard him. For full sixty thousand years, O chief of the celestials, Vritra practised the severest penances for obtaining strength. Brahman gave him the boons he had solicited, _viz_., the greatness that belongs to Yogins, large powers of illusion, excess of might, and superabundant energy. I impart to thee my energy, O Vasava! The Danava has now lost his coolness. Do thou, therefore, slay him now with thy thunderbolt!’

“Sakra said, ‘Before thy eyes, O foremost of gods, I shall, through thy grace, slay with my thunderbolt this invincible son of Diti.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘When the great _Asura_ or Daitya was overtaken by that fever (born of Mahadeva's energy), the deities and the _Rishis_, filled with joy, uttered loud cheers, At the same time drums, and conchs of loud blare, and kettle drums and tabors began to beat and blow by thousands. Suddenly all the _Asuras_ became afflicted with the loss of memory. In a trice, their powers of illusion also disappeared. The _Rishis_ and the deities, ascertaining the foe to be thus possessed, uttered the praises of both Sakra and Isana, and began to urge the former (to make no delay in destroying Vritra). The form that Indra assumed on the eve of the encounter, while seated on his car and while his praises were being hymned by the _Rishis_, became such that none could look at it without awe.’” [^893]

## SECTION CCLXXXII

“Bhishma said, ‘Listen, O king, to me as I tell thee the symptoms that appeared on the body of Vritra when he was overtaken by that fever (born of the energy of Mahadeva). The heroic Asura's mouth began to emit flames of fire. He became exceedingly pale. His body began to tremble all over. His breath became hard and thick. His hairs stood on end. His memory, O Bharata, issued out of his mouth in the form of a fierce, dreadful, and inauspicious jackal. Burning and blazing meteors fell on his right and left. Vultures and _kanakas_ and cranes, gathering together, uttered fierce cries, as they wheeled over Vritra's head. Then, in that encounter, Indra, adored by the gods, and armed with the thunderbolt, looked hard at the Daitya as the latter sat on his car. Possessed by that violent fever, the mighty _Asura_, O monarch, yawned and uttered inhuman cries. [^894] While the Asura was yawning Indra hurled his thunderbolt at him. Endued with exceedingly great energy and resembling the fire that destroys the creation at the end of the Yuga, that thunderbolt overthrew in a trice Vritra of gigantic form. Loud shouts were once more uttered by the gods on all sides when they beheld Vritra slain, O bull of Bharata's race! Having slain Vritra, Maghavat, that foe of the Danavas, possessed of great fame, entered heaven with that thunderbolt pervaded by Vishnu. Just then, O thou of Kuru's race, the sin of Brahmanicide (in her embodied form), fierce and awful and inspiring all the worlds with dread, issued out of the body of the slain Vritra. Of terrible teeth and awful, hideous for ugliness, and dark and tawny, with hair dishevelled, and dreadful eyes, O Bharata, with a garland of skulls round her neck, and looking like an (Atharvan) Incantation (in its embodied form), O bull of Bharata's race, covered all over with blood, and clad in rags and barks of trees, O thou of righteous soul, she came out of Vritra's body. Of such dreadful form and mien, O monarch, she sought the wielder of the thunderbolt (for possessing him). A little while after, O thou of Kuru's race, the slayer of Vritra, on some purpose connected with the good of the three worlds, was proceeding towards heaven. Beholding Indra of great energy thus proceeding on his mission, she seized the chief of the deities and from that moment stuck to him. [^895] When the sin of Brahmanicide thus stuck to his person and inspired him with terror, Indra entered the fibres of a lotus-stalk and dwelt there for many long years. But the sin of Brahmanicide pursued him closely. Indeed, O son of Kuru, <span id="p308"><sup><small>[ p. 308 ]</small></sup></span> seized by her, Indra became deprived of all his energies. He made great efforts for driving her from him, but all those efforts proved abortive. Seized by her, O bull of Bharata's race, the chief of the deities at last presented himself before the Grandsire and worshipped him by bending his head low. Understanding that Sakra was possessed by the sin of Brahmanicide, [^896] Brahman began to reflect, O best of the Bharatas, (upon the means of freeing his suppliant). The grandsire at last, O thou of mighty arms, addressed Brahmanicide in a sweet voice as if from the desire of pacifying her, and said, ‘O amiable one, let the chief of the celestials, who is a favourite of mine, be freed from thee. Tell me, what I shall do for thee. What wish of thine shall I accomplish?’

“Brahmanicide said, ‘When the Creator of the three worlds, when the illustrious god adored by the universe, hath been pleased with me, I regard my wishes as already accomplished. Let my residence be now appointed. Desirous of preserving the worlds, this rule had been made by thee. It was thou, O lord, that didst introduced this important ordinance. [^897] As thou hast been gratified with me, O righteous Lord, O puissant Master of all the worlds, I shall certainly leave Sakra! But grant me an abode to dwell in.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘The Grandsire replied unto Brahmanicide, saying, ‘So be it!’ Indeed, the Grandsire discovered means for dispelling Brahmanicide from the person of Indra. The Self-create recollected the high-souled Agni. The latter immediately presented himself to Brahman and said these words, ‘O illustrious and divine Lord, O thou that are without any defect, I have appeared before thee. It behoveth thee to say what I shall have to accomplish.’

“Brahman said, ‘I shall divide this sin of Brahmanicide into several portions. For freeing Sakra from her, do thou take a fourth portion of that sin.’

“Agni said, ‘How shall I be rescued from her, O Brahman? O puissant Lord, do thou appoint the way. I desire to know the means (of my own rescue) in detail, O adored of all the worlds!’

“Brahman said, ‘Unto that man who, overwhelmed by the quality of Tamas, will abstain from offering thee as an oblation, when he beholds thee in thy blazing form, seeds, herbs, and juices, that portion of Brahmanicide which thou wilt take upon thyself shall immediately enter, and leaving thee shall dwell in him. O carrier off oblations, let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Thus addressed by the Grandsire the eater of oblations and sacrificial offerings accepted his command. A fourth of that sin then entered his person, O king! The Grandsire then summoned the trees, the herbs, and all kinds of grass to him, and solicited them to take upon themselves a fourth of that sin. Addressed by him, the trees and herbs and grasses became <span id="p309"><sup><small>[ p. 309 ]</small></sup></span> as much agitated as Agni had been at the request, and they replied unto Grandsire, saying, ‘How shall we, O Grandsire of all the worlds, be ourselves rescued from this sin? It behoveth thee not to afflict us that have already been afflicted by the fates. O god, we have always to endure heat and cold and the showers (of the clouds) driven by the winds, in addition to the cutting and the tearing (that we have to suffer at the hands of men). We are willing, O Lord of the three worlds, to take at thy command (a portion of) this sin of Brahmanicide. Let the means, however, of our rescue be pointed out to us.’

“Brahman said, ‘This sin that you shall take shall possess the man who through stupefaction of judgment will cut or tear any of you when _Parva_ days come.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Thus addressed by the high-souled Brahman, the trees and herbs and grasses adored the Creator and then went away without tarrying there. The Grandsire of all the worlds then summoned the _Apsaras_ and gratifying them with sweet words, O Bharata, said, ‘This foremost of ladies, _viz_., Brahmanicide, has come out of Indra's person. Solicited by me, do you take a fourth portion of her into your own persons (for saving the Chief of the deities).’

“The Apsaras said, ‘O Lord of all the gods, at thy command we are fully willing to take a portion of this sin. But, O Grandsire, do thou think of the means by which we ourselves may be freed from (the effects of) this understanding (that we make with thee).’

“Brahman said, ‘Let the fever of your hearts be dispelled. The portion of this sin that you will take upon yourselves shall leave you for instantly possessing that man who will seek congress with women in their menstrual season!’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus addressed by the Grandsire, O bull of Bharata's race, the diverse tribes of the Apsaras, with cheerful souls, repaired to their respective places and began to sport in delight. The illustrious Creator of the three worlds, endued with great ascetic merit, then recollected the Waters which immediately came to him. Arrived at the presence of Brahman of immeasurable energy, the Waters bowed unto him and said these words, ‘We have come before thee, O chastiser of foes, at thy command. O puissant Master of all the worlds, tell us what we are to accomplish.’

“Brahman said, ‘This dreadful sin hath taken possession of Indra, in consequence of his having slain Vritra. Take ye a fourth part of Brahmanicide.’

“The Waters said, ‘Let it be as thou commandest, O master of all the worlds. It behoveth thee, however, O puissant Lord of ours, to think of the means by which we may (in our turn) be rescued from (the consequence of) this understanding. Though art the Lord of all the deities, and the supreme refuge of the universe. Who else is there to whom we may pay our adorations so that he may relieve us from distress.’

“Brahman said, ‘Unto that man who stupefied by his understanding and regarding you lightly will cast into you phlegm and urine and excreta, this one shall immediately go and thenceforth reside in him. It is in this way, <span id="p310"><sup><small>[ p. 310 ]</small></sup></span> verily I say unto ye, that your rescue shall be accomplished.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Then the sin of Brahmanicide, O Yudhishthira, leaving the chief of the deities, proceeded to the abodes that were ordained for her at the Grandsire's command. It was thus, O ruler of men, that Indra had become afflicted by that dreadful sin (and it was thus that he got rid of her). With the Grandsire's permission Indra then resolved to perform a Horse-sacrifice. It is heard, O monarch, that Indra having been thus possessed by the sin of Brahmanicide afterwards became cleansed of her through that Sacrifice. Regaining his prosperity and slaying thousands of foes, great was the joy that Vasava obtained, O lord of Earth! From the blood of Vritra, O son of Pritha, were born high-crested cocks. For this reason, those fowls are unclean (as food) for the regenerate classes, and those ascetics that have undergone the rite of initiation. Under all circumstances, O king, do thou accomplish what is agreeable to the twice-born, for these, O monarch, are known as gods on earth. It was in this way, O thou of Kurds race, that the mighty Asura Vritra was slain by Sakra of immeasurable energy by the aid of subtle intelligence and through the application of means. Thou also, O son of Kunti, unvanquished on earth, wilt become another Indra and the slayer of all thy foes. Those men who, on every _Parva_ day, will recite this sacred narrative of Vritra in the midst of Brahmanas shall never be stained by any sin. I have now recited to thee one of the greatest and most wonderful feats of Indra connected with Vritra. What else dost thou wish to hear?'”


## SECTION CCLXXXIII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘O grandsire, thou art possessed of great wisdom and thoroughly conversant with every branch of learning. From this very narrative of the slaughter of Vritra the wish has arisen in my mind of asking thee a question. Thou hast said, O ruler of men, that Vritra was (first) stupefied by Fever, and that then, O sinless one, he was slain by Vasava with the thunderbolt. How did this Fever, O thou of great wisdom, arise? O lord, I desire to hear in detail of the origin of Fever.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Listen, O king, to the origin, celebrated over all the world, of Fever. I shall speak in detail on this topic, fully explaining how Fever first sprang into existence, O Bharata! In days of yore, O monarch, there was a summit, named Savitri, of the mountains of Meru. Worshipped by all the worlds, it was endued with great splendour and adorned with every kind of jewels and gems. That summit was immeasurable in extent and thither no one could go. [^898] On that mountain summit the divine Mahadeva used to sit in splendour as if on a bed-stead adorned with gold. The daughter of the <span id="p311"><sup><small>[ p. 311 ]</small></sup></span> king of mountains, sitting by his side, shone in brilliance. [^899] The high-souled deities, the Vasus of immeasurable energy, the high-souled Aswins, those foremost of physicians, and king Vaisravana waited upon by many a Guhyaka,—that lord of the Yakshas, endued with prosperity and puissance, and having his abode on the summit of Kailasa,—all waited upon the highsouled Mahadeva. And the great sage Usanas, and the foremost of _Rishis_ having Sanatkumara for their first, and the other celestial _Rishis_ headed by Angiras, and the Gandharva Viswavasu, and Narada and Parvata, and the diverse tribes of _Apsaras_, all came there to wait upon the Master of the universe. A pure and auspicious breeze, bearing diverse kinds of perfumes, blew there. The trees that stood there were adorned with the flowers of every season. A large number of Vidyadharas and Siddhas and ascetics too, O Bharata, repaired thither for waiting upon Mahadeva, the Lord of all creatures. Many ghostly beings, also, of diverse forms and aspects, and many dreadful Rakshasas and mighty Pisachas, of diverse aspects, mad with joy, and armed with diverse kinds of uplifted weapons, forming the train of Mahadeva, were there, every one of whom resembled a blazing fire in energy. The illustrious Nandi stood there at the command of the great god, blazing with his own energy and armed with a lance that resembled a flame of fire. Ganga also, that foremost of all Rivers and born of all sacred waters in the universe, waited there in her embodied form, O son of Kuru's race, upon that illustrious deity. Thus adored by the celestial Rishis and the gods, the illustrious Mahadeva of immeasurable energy dwelt on that summit of Meru.

“After some time had passed away, the Prajapati Daksha [^900] commenced to perform a Sacrifice according to the ancient rites (laid down in the Vedas). Unto the Sacrifice of Daksha, all the deities headed by Sakra, assembling together, resolved to repair. It hath been heard by us that the high-souled deities, with the permission o f Mahadeva, mounted their celestial cars resembling the fire or the Sun in splendour, and proceeded to that spot (on the Himavat) whence the Ganges is said to issue. Beholding the deities depart, the excellent daughter of the king of mountains, addressed her divine spouse, _viz_., the Lord of all creatures, and said, ‘O illustrious one, whither are those deities headed by Sakra going? O thou that art conversant with the truth, tell me truly, for a great doubt has filled my mind.’

“Maheswara said, ‘O lady that art highly blessed, the excellent Prajapati Daksha is adoring the gods in a Horse-sacrifice. These denizens of heaven are proceeding even thither.’

“Uma said, ‘Why, O Mahadeva, dost thou not proceed to that Sacrifice? What objection is there of thy going to that place?’

“Maheswara said, ‘O highly blessed lady, the deities in days of yore made <span id="p312"><sup><small>[ p. 312 ]</small></sup></span> an arrangement in consequence of which no share was assigned to me of offerings in all Sacrifices. Agreeably to the course that was sanctioned in consequence of that arrangement, O thou of the fairest complexion, the deities do not give me, following the old custom, any share of the sacrificial offerings.’

“Uma said, O illustrious one, among all beings thou art the foremost in puissance. In merit, in energy, in fame, and in prosperity, thou yieldest to none, and thou art, indeed, superior to all. In consequence, however, of this disability in respect of a share (in the Sacrificial offerings) I am filled with great grief, O sinless one, and a tremor overtakes me from head to foot.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘The goddess (Parvati), having said these words unto her divine spouse, the Lord of all creatures, O monarch, remained silent, her heart burning the while in grief. Then Mahadeva, understanding what was in her heart and what her thoughts were (for wiping off that disgrace), addressed Nandi, saying, ‘Wait here (by the goddess). Summoning all his Yoga force, that Lord of all lords of Yoga, that god of gods, that wielder of Pinaka, possessed of mighty energy, quickly proceeded to the place (where Daksha was sacrificing) accompanied by all his terrible followers and destroyed that Sacrifice. Amongst these followers of his, some uttered loud cries, and some laughed terribly, and some, O king, extinguished the (Sacrificial) fires with blood; and some, possessed of awful faces, pulling up the sacrificial stakes, began to whirl them. Others began to devour those that were ministering to the Sacrifice. Then that sacrifice, thus afflicted on every side, assumed the form of a deer and sought to fly away through the skies. Ascertaining that the Sacrifice was running away in that form, the puissant Mahadeva began to pursue him with bow and arrow. In consequence of the wrath that then filled the heart of that foremost of all gods, possessed of immeasurable energy, a dreadful drop of sweat appeared on his forehead. When that drop of sweat fell down on the earth, there forthwith appeared a blazing fire resembling the (all-destructive) conflagration that appears at the end of a Yuga. From that fire issued a dreadful being, O monarch, of very short stature, possessed of blood-red eyes and a green beard. His body was covered entirely with hair like a hawk's or an owl's and his hair stood erect. Of dreadful aspect, his complexion was dark and his attire blood-red. Like a fire burning a heap of dry grass or straw, that Being of great energy quickly consumed the embodied form of Sacrifice. Having accomplished that feat, he then rushed towards the deities and the _Rishis_ that had assembled there. The deities, filled with fear, fled in all directions. In consequence of that Being's tread, the earth, O monarch began to tremble. [^901] Exclamations of _Oh_ and _Alas_ arose throughout the universe. Marking this, the puissant Grandsire, showing himself unto Mahadeva, addressed him in the following words.’

“Brahman said, ‘O puissant one, the deities will henceforth yield thee a share of the sacrificial offerings! O Lord of all the deities, let this wrath of thine <span id="p313"><sup><small>[ p. 313 ]</small></sup></span> be withdrawn by thee! O scorcher of foes, there, those gods, and the Rishis, in consequence of thy wrath, O Mahadeva, have become exceedingly agitated. This Being also, that hath sprung from thy sweat, O foremost of gods, shall wander among creatures, O righteous-souled one, under the name of Fever. O puissant one, if the energy of this Being remains all collected together, then the entire earth herself will not be able to bear him. Let him, therefore, be distributed into many parts.’ When Brahman had said these words, and when his proper share was appointed of the sacrificial offerings, Mahadeva replied unto the Grandsire of great energy, saying, ‘So be id’ Indeed, the wielder of Pinaka, _viz_., Bhava, smiled a little and became filled with joy. And he accepted the share that the Grandsire appointed of the offerings in sacrifices. Conversant with the properties of everything, Mahadeva then distributed Fever into many portions, for the peace of all creatures. Listen, O son, as to how he did this. The heat that is perceptible in the heads of elephants, the bitumen of mountains, [^902] the moss that floats on water, the slough of snakes, the sores that appear in the hoofs of bulls, the sterile tracts of earth that are full of saline matter, the dullness of vision of all animals, the diseases that appear in the throats of horses, the crests appearing on the heads of peacocks, the eye-disease of the koel, [^903] each of these was named Fever by the high-souled Mahadeva. This is what has been heard by us. The liver-disease also of sheep, and the hiccup of parrots are also each known as forms of Fever. To this must be added the toil that tigers undergo, for that also, O, righteous king, is known as a from of Fever. Besides these, O Bharata, amongst men, Fever enters all bodies at the time of birth, of death, and on other occasions. This then that is called Fever is known to be the dreadful energy of Maheswara. He is endued with authority over all creatures and should, therefore, be held in respect and worshipped by all. It was by him that Vritra, that foremost of virtuous persons, was overtaken when he yawned. It was then that Sakra hurled his thunderbolt at him. Thunderbolt, penetrating the body of Vritra, O Bharata, divided him in twain. Divided in twain by the thunderbolt, the mighty _Asura_ possessed of great Yoga powers, proceeded to the region of Vishnu of immeasurable energy. It was in consequence of his devotion to Vishnu that he had succeeded in overwhelming the whole universe. And it was in consequence of his devotion to Vishnu that he ascended, when slain, to the region of Vishnu. Thus, O son, adverting: to the story of Vritra have I recited to thee the narrative in detail of Fever. Upon what else shall I speak to thee? That man who will read this account of the origin of Fever with close attention and cheerful heart shall become free from disease and shall always have happiness for his share. Filled with gladness, he shall have all the wishes accomplished upon which he may set his heart.’”

## SECTION CCLXXXIV

“Janamejaya said, ‘How O Brahmana, was the Horse-sacrifice of the Prajapati Daksha, the son of Prachetas, destroyed during the age of Vaivaswata Manu? Understanding that the goddess Uma had become filled with rage and grief, the puissant Mahadeva, who is the soul of all things, gave way to wrath. How, again, through his grace, was Daksha enable to reunite the divided limbs of that Sacrifice? I desire to know all this. Tell me all this, O Brahmana, truly as it occurred.’

“Vaisampayana said, ‘In days of yore Daksha made arrangements for performing a Sacrifice on the breast of Himavat in that sacred region inhabited by Rishis and Siddhas where the Ganges issues out of the mountains. Overgrown with trees and creepers of diverse kinds that spot abounded with Gandharvas and Apsaras. Surrounded by crowds of Rishis, Daksha, that foremost of virtuous men, that progenitor of creatures, was waited upon by the denizens of the earth, the firmament, and the heavens, with their hands joined together in reverence. The gods, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the Snakes, the Rakshasas, the two Gandharvas named Haha and Huhu, Tumvuru and Narada, Viswavasu, Viswasena, the Gandharvas and the Apsaras, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Maruts, all came there with Indra for sharing in the Sacrifice. The drinkers of Soma, the drinkers of smoke, the drinkers of Ajya, the Rishis, and the Pitris came there with the Brahmanas. These, and many other living creatures belonging to the four orders, _viz_., viviparous and oviparous and filth-born and vegetable, were invited to that Sacrifice. The gods also, with their spouses, respectfully invited thereto, came on their celestial cars and seated thereon shone like blazing fires. Beholding them, the Rishi Dadhichi became filled with grief and wrath, and said, ‘This is neither a Sacrifice nor a meritorious rite of religion, since Rudra is not adored in it. Ye are certainly exposing yourselves to death and chains. Alas, how untoward is the course of time. Stupefied by error you do not behold that destruction awaits you. A terrible calamity stands at your door in course of this great Sacrifice. Ye are blind to it!’ Having said these words, that great Yogin saw into the future with eyes of (Yoga) contemplation. He beheld Mahadeva, and his divine spouse, viz., that giver of excellent boons (seated on the summit of Kailasa) with the highsouled Narada sitting beside the goddess. Conversant with Yoga, Dadhichi became highly gratified, having ascertained what was about to happen. All the deities and others that had come there were of one mind with reference to the omission to invite the Lord of all creatures. Dadhichi alone, desirous of leaving that spot, then said, ‘By worshipping one who should not be worshipped, and by refusing to worship him who should be worshipped, a man incurs the sin of homicide for ever. I have never before spoken an untruth, and an untruth I shall never speak. Here in the midst of the gods and the Rishis I say the truth. The Protector of all creatures, the Creator of the universe, the Lord of all, the Puissant master, the taker of sacrificial offerings, <span id="p315"><sup><small>[ p. 315 ]</small></sup></span> will soon come to this Sacrifice and you all shall see him.’

“Daksha said, ‘We have many Rudras armed with lances and bearing matted locks on their heads. They are eleven in number. I know them all, but I do not know who this (new Rudra) Maheswara is.’

“Dadhichi said, ‘This seems to be the counsel of all that are here, _viz_., that Maheswara should not be invited. As, however, I do not behold any god that can be said to be superior to him. I am sure that this proposed Sacrifice of Daksha will certainly be overtaken by destruction.’

“Daksha said, ‘Here, in this vessel of gold, intended for the Lord of all Sacrifices, is the sacrificial offering sanctified by _mantras_ and (rites) according to the ordinance. I intend to make this offering unto Vishnu who is beyond compare. He is puissant and the Master of all, and unto Him should sacrifices be performed.’

‘Meanwhile,’ continued Vaisampayana, ‘the goddess Uma, sitting with her lord, said these words.’

“Uma said, ‘What are those gifts, what those vows, and what are those penances, that I should make or undergo by means of which my illustrious husband may be able to obtain a half or a third share of the offerings in sacrifices. Unto his wife who was agitated with grief and who repeated these words the illustrious Mahadeva said with a joyous countenance, ‘Thou dost not know me, O goddess! Thou knowest not, O thou of delicate limbs and low belly, what words are proper to be addressed to the Lord of Sacrifices. O lady of large eyes, I know that it is only the sinful, who are bereft of contemplation, that do not understand me. [^904] It is through thy power of illusion that the deities with Indra at their head and the three worlds all become stupefied. [^905] It is to me that the chanters utter their praises in Sacrifices. It is to me that the Saman-singers sing their _Rathantaras_. It is to me that Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas perform their Sacrifices. And it is to me that the Adhvaryus dedicate the shares of sacrificial offerings.’

“The goddess said, ‘Persons of even ordinary abilities applaud themselves and indulge in the presence of their spouses. There is no doubt in this.’

“The holy one said, ‘O Queen of all the gods, I do not certainly applaud my ownself. Behold now, O lady of slender waist, what I do. Behold the Being that I will create, O thou of the fairest complexion, for (destroying) this Sacrifice (that has displeased thee), O my beautiful spouse.

“Having said these words unto his spouse Uma who was dearer to him than his own life, the puissant Mahadeva created from his mouth a terrible Being whose very sight could make one's hair stand on its end. The blazing flames that emanated from his body rendered him exceedingly awful to behold. His arms were many in number and in each was a weapon that struck the beholder with fear. That Being, thus created, stood before the great god, with joined <span id="p316"><sup><small>[ p. 316 ]</small></sup></span> hands, and said, ‘What commands shall I have to accomplish?’ Maheswara answered him, saying, ‘Go and destroy the Sacrifice of Daksha.’ Thus ordered, that Being of leonine prowess who had issued from the mouth of Mahadeva, desired to destroy the Sacrifice of Daksha, without putting forth all his energy and without the assistance of any one else, for dispelling the wrath of Uma. Urged by her wrath, the spouse of Maheswara, herself assuming a dreadful form that is known by the name Mahakali, proceeded in the company of that Being who had issued from Mahadeva's mouth, for witnessing with her own eyes the act of destruction which was her own (for it was she who had impelled her lord to accomplish it for her sake). That mighty Being then set out, having obtained the permission of Mahadeva and having bowed his head unto him. In energy, strength, and form, he resembled Maheswara himself who had created him. Indeed, he was the living embodiment of (Mahadeva's) wrath. Of immeasurable might and energy, and of immeasurable courage and prowess, he came to be called by the name of Virabhadra—that dispeller of the goddess's wrath. He then created from the pores of his body a large number of spirit chiefs known by the name of Raumyas. Those fierce bands of spirits, endued with terrible energy and prowess and resembling Rudra himself on that account, rushed with the force of thunder to that place where Daksha was making preparations for his sacrifice, impelled by the desire of destroying it. Possessed of dreadful and gigantic forms, they numbered by hundreds and thousands. They filled the sky with their confused cries and shrieks. That noise filled the denizens of heaven with fear. The very mountains were riven and the earth trembled. Whirl winds began to blow. The Ocean rose in a surge. The fires that were kindled refused to blaze up. The Sun became dimmed. The planets, the stars, and constellations, and the moon, no longer shone. The Rishis, the gods, and human beings, looked pale. A universal darkness spread over earth and sky. The insulted Rudras began to set fire to everything. Some amongst them of terrible form began to smite and strike. Some tore up the sacrificial stakes. Some began to grind and others to crush. Endued with the speed of wind or thought, some began to rush close and far. Some began to break the sacrificial vessels and the celestial ornaments. The scattered fragments strewed the ground like stars bespangling the firmament. Heaps of excellent viands, of bottles of drink, and of eatables there were that looked like mountains. Rivers of milk ran on every side, with clarified butter and _Payasa_ for their mire, creamy curds for their water, and crystalised sugar for their sands. Those rivers contained all the six tastes. There were lakes of treacle that looked very beautiful. Meat of diverse kinds, of the best quality, and other eatables of various sorts, and many excellent varieties of drink, and several other kinds of food that might be licked and sucked, began to be eaten by that army of spirits with diverse mouths. And they began to cast off and scatter those varieties of food in all directions. In consequence of Rudra's wrath, every one of those gigantic Beings looked like the all-destructive Yuga-fire. Agitating the celestial troops they caused them to tremble with fear and fly away in all directions. Those fierce spirits sported <span id="p317"><sup><small>[ p. 317 ]</small></sup></span> with one another, and seizing the celestial damsels shoved and hurled them on all sides. Of fierce deeds, those Beings, impelled by Rudra's wrath, very soon burnt that Sacrifice although it was protected with great care by all the deities. Loud were the roars they uttered which struck every living creature with dread. Having torn off the head of Sacrifice they indulged in glee and shouts. Then the gods headed by Brahman, and that progenitor of creatures, _viz_., Daksha, joining their hands in reverence, addressed that mighty Being, saying, ‘Tell us, who thou art.’

“Virabhadra said, ‘I am neither Rudra nor his spouse, the goddess Uma. Nor have I come here for partaking of the fare (provided in this Sacrifice). Knowing the fact of Uma's wrath, the puissant Lord who is the soul of all creatures has given way to wrath. I have not come here for seeing these foremost of Brahmanas. I have not come here urged by curiosity. Know that I have come here for destroying this Sacrifice of yours. I am known by the name of Virabhadra and I have sprung from the wrath of Rudra. This lady (who is my companion), and who is called Bhadrakali, hath sprung from the wrath of the goddess. We have both been despatched by that god of gods, and we have accordingly come here. O foremost of Brahmanas, seek the protection of that Lord of the deities, the spouse of Uma. It is preferable to incur even the wrath of that foremost of gods than to obtain boons from any other Deity.

“Daksha said, ‘If the great god has been gratified with me,—‘if indeed, I have become an object of favour with him,—if I have deserved his kindness,—if the great Lord of all creatures is disposed to grant me boons,—then let all these articles of mine that have been burnt, eaten, drunk, swallowed, destroyed, broken, and polluted,—let all these articles, collected in course of these articles be of use to me. Even this is the boon I crave.’ Unto him the many long years, and with great care and effort, go not for nothing. Let <span id="p318"><sup><small>[ p. 318 ]</small></sup></span> illustrious Hara, the tearer of Bhaga's eyes, said, ‘Let it be as thou sayest!’ Even these were the words of that illustrious progenitor of all creatures, that god of three eyes, that protector of righteousness. [^906] Having obtained that boon from Bhava, Daksha knelt down to him and adored that deity having the bull for his mark, by uttering his thousand and eight names.’

Let them (peacefully) enjoy those offerings made with Swaha and Swadha, and let them derive pleasure from those presents. I bow to them. [^937] Let those Beings that are of the stature of the thumb and that dwell in all bodies, always protect and gratify me. [^938] I always bow to those Beings who dwelling within embodied creatures make the latter cry in grief without themselves crying in grief, and who gladden them without themselves being glad. I always bow to those Rudras who dwell in rivers, in oceans, in hills and mountains, in mountain-caves, in the roots of trees, in cow-pens, in inaccessible forests, in the intersections of roads, in roads, in open squares, in banks (of rivers and lakes and oceans), in elephant-sheds, in stables, in car-sheds, in deserted gardens and houses, in the five primal elements, and in the cardinal and subsidiary directions. I bow repeatedly unto them that dwell in the space amidst the Sun and the Moon, as also in rays of the Sun and the Moon, and them that dwell in the nether regions, and them that have betaken themselves to Renunciation and other superior practices for the sake of the Supreme. [^939] I bow always unto them that are unnumbered, that are unmeasured, and that have no form, unto those Rudras, that is, that are endued with infinite attributes. Since thou, O Rudra, art the Creator of all creatures, since, O Hara, thou art the Master of all creatures, and since thou art the indwelling Soul of all creatures, therefore wert thou not invited by me (to my Sacrifices). Since thou art He who is adored in all sacrifices with plentiful gifts, and since it is Thou that art the Creator of all things, therefore I did not invite thee. Or, perhaps, O god, stupefied by thy subtile illusion I failed to invite thee. Be gratified with me, blessed by thyself, O Bhava, with me possessed by the quality of Rajas. My Mind, my Understanding, and my Chitta all dwell in thee, O god!

“Hearing these adorations, that Lord of all creatures, _viz_., Mahadeva, ceased (to think of inflicting further injuries on Daksha). Indeed, highly gratified, the illustrious deity addressed Daksha, saying, ‘O Daksha of excellent vows, pleased have I been with these adorations of thine. Thou needst not praise me more. Thou shalt attain to my companionship. Through my grace, O progenitor of creatures, thou shalt earn the fruit of a thousand horse-sacrifices, and a hundred Vajapeyas (in consequence of this one incomplete sacrifice of thine).

“Once more, Mahadeva, that thorough master of words, addressed Daksha and said unto him these words fraught with high consolation, ‘Be thou the foremost of all creatures in the world. Thou shouldst not, O Daksha, entertain any feelings of grief for these injuries inflicted on thy Sacrifice. It has been <span id="p328"><sup><small>[ p. 328 ]</small></sup></span> seen that in former _Kalpas_ too I had to destroy thy Sacrifice. [^940] O thou of excellent vows, I shall grant thee again some more boons. Take them from me. Dispelling this cheerlessness that overspreads thy face, listen to me with undivided attention. With the aid of arguments addressed to reason the deities and the Danavas have extracted from the Vedas consisting of six branches and from the system of Sankhya and Yoga a creed in consequence of which they have practised the austerest penances for many long years. The religion, however, which I have extracted, is unparalleled, and productive of benefits on every side. It is open to men in all modes of life to practise it. It leads to Emancipation. It may be acquired in many years or through merit by persons who have restrained their senses. It is shrouded in mystery. They that are divested of wisdom regard it as censurable. It is opposed to the duties laid down in respect of the four orders of men and the four modes of life, and agrees with those duties in only a few particulars. They that are well-skilled in the science of (drawing) conclusions (from premises) can understand its propriety: and they who have transcended all the modes of life are worthy of adopting it. In days of yore, O Daksha, this auspicious religion called Pasupata had been extracted by me. The proper observance of that religion produces immense benefits. Let those benefits be thine, O highly blessed one! Cast off this fever of thy heart.’ Having said these words, Mahadeva, with his spouse (Uma) and with all his attendants disappeared from the view of Daksha of immeasurable prowess. He who would recite this hymn that was first uttered by Daksha or who would listen to it when recited by another, would never meet with the smallest evil and would attain to a long life. Indeed, as Siva is the foremost of all the deities, even so is this hymn, agreeable with the _Srutis_, is the foremost of all hymns. Persons desirous of fame, kingdom, happiness, pleasure, profit, and wealth, as also those desirous of learning, should listen with feelings of devotion to the recital of this hymn. One suffering from disease, one distressed by pain, one plunged into melancholy, one afflicted by thieves or by fear, one under the displeasure of the king in respect of his charge, becomes freed from fear (by listening or reciting this hymn). By listening to or reciting this hymn, one, in even this earthly body of his, attains to equality with the spirits forming the attendants of Mahadeva. One becomes endued with energy and fame, and cleansed of all sin (through the virtue of this hymn). Neither Rakshasas, nor Pisachas, nor ghosts, nor Vinayakas, create disturbances in his house where this hymn is recited. That woman, again, who listens to this hymn with pious faith, observing the while the practices of Brahmacharya, wins worship as a goddess in the family of her sire and that of her husband. [^941] All the acts of that person become always crowned with success who listens or recites with rapt attention to the whole of this hymn. In consequence of the recitation of this hymn all the wishes one forms in one's mind and all the wishes one clothes in words become crowned <span id="p329"><sup><small>[ p. 329 ]</small></sup></span> with fruition. That man obtains all objects of enjoyment and pleasure and all things that are wished for by him, who, practising self-restraint, makes according to due rites offerings unto Mahadeva, Guha, Uma, and Nandi, and after that utters their names without delay, in proper order and with devotion. Such a man, departing from this life, ascends to heaven, and has never to take birth among the intermediate animals or birds. This was said even by the puissant Vyasa, the son of Parasara.’”

## SECTION CCLXXXVI

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, what is Adhyatma with respect to man and whence it arises.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Aided by the science of Adhyatma one may know everything. It is, again, superior to all things. I shall, with the help of my intelligence, explain to thee that Adhyatma about which thou askest me. Listen, O son, to my explanation. Earth, Wind, Space, Water, and Light forming the fifth, are the great essences. These are (the causes of) the origin and the destruction of all creatures. The bodies of living creatures (both subtile and gross), O bull of Bharata's race, are the result of the combination of the virtues of these five. Those virtues (whose combinations produce the bodies of creatures) repeatedly start into existence and repeatedly merge into the original cause of all things, _viz_., the Supreme Soul. [^942] From those five primal essences are created all creatures, and into those five great elements all creatures resolve themselves, repeatedly, like the infinite waves of the Ocean rising from the Ocean and subsiding into that which causes them. As a tortoise stretches forth its legs and withdraws them again into itself, even so the infinite number of creatures spring from (and enter) these five great fixed essences. Verily, sound springs from Space, and all dense matter is the attribute of earth. Life is from Wind. Taste is from Water. Form is said to be the property of Light. The entire mobile and immobile universe is thus these five great essences existing together in various proportions. When Destruction comes, the infinite diversity of creatures resolve themselves into those five, and once more, when Creation begins, they spring from the same five. The Creator places in all creatures the same five great essences in proportions that He thinks proper. Sound, the ears, and all cavities,—these three,—have Space for their producing cause. Taste, all watery or juicy substances, and the tongue, are said to be the properties of water. Form, the eye, and the digestive fire in the stomach, are said to partake of the nature of <span id="p330"><sup><small>[ p. 330 ]</small></sup></span> Light. Scent, the organ of smelling, and the body, are the properties of earth. Life, touch, and action are said to be the properties of Wind. I have thus explained to thee, O king, all the properties of the five primal essences. Having created these, the Supreme Deity, O Bharata, united with them Sattwa, Rajas, Tamas, Time, Consciousness of functions, and Mind forming the sixth. [^943] That which is called the Understanding dwells in the interior of what thou seest above the soles of the feet and below the crown of the head. In man the senses (of knowledge) are five. The sixth (sense) is the Mind. The seventh is called the Understanding. The Kshetrajna or Soul is the eighth. The senses and that which is the Actor should be ascertained by apprehension of their respective functions. The conditions or states called Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, depend upon the senses for their refuge or formation. The senses exist for simply seizing the impressions of their respective objects. The Mind has doubt for its function. The Understanding is for ascertainment. The Kshetrajna is said to be only an inactive witness (of the functions of the others). Sattwa, Rajas, Tamas, Time, and Acts, O Bharata, these attributes direct the Understanding. The Understanding is the senses and the five fore-mentioned attributes. [^944] When the Understanding is wanting, the senses with the mind, and the five other attributes (_viz_., Sattwa, Rajas, Tamas, Time, and Acts) cease to be. That by which the Understanding sees is called the eye. When the Understanding hears, it is called the ear. When she smells, she becomes the sense of scent; and when she tastes the various objects of taste, she comes to be called by the name of tongue. When again she feels the touch of the various objects of touch, she becomes the sense of touch. It is the Understanding that becomes modified diversely and frequently. When the Understanding desires anything, she becomes Mind. The five senses with the Mind, which separately constitute the foundations (of the Understanding), are the creations of the Understanding. They are called _Indriyas_. When they become stained, the Understanding also becomes stained. [^945] The Understanding, dwelling in Jiva, exists in three states. Sometimes she obtains joy; sometimes she indulges in grief; and sometimes she exists in a state that is neither pleasure nor pain. Having for her essence these conditions or states (_viz_., Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas), the Understanding resolves through these three states. [^946] As the lord of rivers, _viz_., the surging Ocean, always keeps within his continents, even so the Understanding, which exists in connection with the (three) <span id="p331"><sup><small>[ p. 331 ]</small></sup></span> states, exists in the Mind (including the senses). When the state of Rajas is awakened, the Understanding becomes modified into Rajas. Transport of delight, joy, gladness, happiness, and contentedness of heart, these, when somehow excited, are the properties of Sattwa. Heart-burning, grief, sorrow, discontentedness, and unforgivingness, [^947] arising from particular causes, are the result of Rajas. Ignorance, attachment and error, heedlessness, stupefaction, and terror, meanness, cheerlessness, sleep, and procrastination,—these, when brought about by particular causes, are the properties of Tamas. Whatever state of either body or mind, connected with joy or happiness, arises, should be regarded as due to the state of Sattwa. Whatever, again, is fraught with sorrow and is disagreeable to oneself should be regarded as arising from Rajas. Without commencing any such act, one should turn one's attention to it (for avoiding it). Whatever is fraught with error or stupefaction in either body or mind, and is inconceivable and mysterious, should be known as connected with Tamas. Thus, have I explained to thee that things in this world dwell in the Understanding. By knowing this one becomes wise. What else can be the indication of wisdom? Know now the difference between these two subtile things, _viz_., Understanding and Soul. One of these, _viz_., the Understanding, creates attributes. The other, _viz_., the Soul, does not create them. Although they are, by nature, distinct from each other, yet they always exist in a state of union. A fish is different from the water in which it dwells, but the fish and the water must exist together. The attributes cannot know the Soul. The Soul, however, knows them. They that are ignorant regard the Soul as existing in a state of union with the attributes like qualities existing with their possessors. This, however, is not the case, for the Soul is truly only an inactive Witness of everything. The Understanding has no refuge. [^948] That which is called life (involving the existence of the Understanding) arises from the effects of the attributes coming together. Others (than these attributes which are created by the Understanding), acting as causes, create the Understanding that dwells in the body. No one can apprehend the attributes in their real nature or form of existence. The Understanding, as already said, creates the attributes. The Soul simply beholds them (as an inactive Witness). This union that exists between the Understanding and the Soul is eternal. The indwelling Understanding apprehends all things through the Senses which are themselves inanimate and unapprehending. Really the senses are only like lamps (that throw their light for discovering objects to others without themselves being able to see them). Even this is the nature (of the Senses, the Understanding, and the Soul). Knowing this, one should live cheerfully, without yielding to either grief or joy. Such a man is said to be beyond the influence of pride. That the Understanding creates all these attributes is due to her own nature,—even as a spider weaves threads in <span id="p332"><sup><small>[ p. 332 ]</small></sup></span> consequence of her own nature. These attributes should be known as the threads the spider weaves. When destroyed, the attributes do not cease to exist; their existence ceases to be visible. When, however, a thing transcends the ken of the senses, its existence (or otherwise) is affirmed by inference. This is the opinion of one set of persons. Others affirm that with destruction the attributes cease to be. Untying this knotty problem addressed to the understanding and reflection, and dispelling all doubt, one should cast off sorrow and live in happiness. [^949] As men unacquainted with its bottom become distressed when they fall upon this earth which is like a river filled with the waters of stupefaction, even so is that man afflicted who falls away from that state in which there is a union with the Understanding. [^950] Men of knowledge, however, conversant with Adhyatma and armed with fortitude, are never afflicted, because they are capable of crossing to the other shore of those waters. Indeed, Knowledge is an efficient raft (in that river). Men of knowledge have not to encounter those frightful terrors which alarm them that are destitute of knowledge. As regards the righteous, none of them attains to an end that is superior to that of any other person amongst them. Indeed, the righteous show, in this respect, an equality. As regards the man of Knowledge, whatever acts have been done by him in past times (while he was steeped in Ignorance) and whatever acts fraught with great iniquity he does (after attainment of Knowledge), he destroys both by Knowledge as his sole means. Then again, upon the attainment of Knowledge he ceases to perpetrate these two evils, _viz_., censuring the wicked acts of others and doing any wicked acts himself under the influence of attachment.’” [^951]

## SECTION CCLXXXVII

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Living creatures always stand in fear of sorrow and death. Tell me, O grandsire, how the occurrence of these two may be prevented.’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection, O Bharata, is cited the old narrative of the discourse between Narada and Samanga.’

“Narada said, ‘(While others salute their superiors by only a bend of the head) thou salutest thy superiors by prostrating thyself on the ground till thy chest comes into contact with the ground. Thou seemest to be engaged in crossing (the river of life) with thy hands. [^952] Thou seemest to be always free from sorrow and exceedingly cheerful. I do not see that thou hast the least anxiety. Thou art always content and happy and thou seemest to sport (in felicity) like a child.’

“Samanga said, ‘O giver of honours, I know the truth about the Past, the Present, and the Future. Hence I never become cheerless. [^953] I know also what the beginning of acts is in this world, what the accession of their fruits, and how varied are those fruits. Hence I never yield to sorrow. [^954] Behold, the illiterate, the destitute, the prosperous, O Narada, the blind, idiots and madmen, and ourselves also, all live. [^955] These live by virtue of their acts of past lives. The very deities, who exist freed from diseases, exist (in that state) by virtue of their past acts. The strong and the weak, all, live by virtue of past acts. It is fitting, therefore, that thou shouldst hold us in esteem. The owners of thousands live. The owners of hundreds also live. They that are overwhelmed with sorrow live. Behold, we too are living! When we, O Narada, do not give way to grief, what can the practice of the duties (of religion) or the observance of (religious) acts do to us? And since all joys and sorrows also are not unending, they are, therefore, unable to agitate us at all. [^956] That for which men <span id="p334"><sup><small>[ p. 334 ]</small></sup></span> are said to be wise, indeed, the very root of wisdom, is the freedom of the senses from error. It is the senses that yield to error and grief. One whose senses are subject to error can never be said to have attained wisdom. That pride which is indulged in by a man subject to error is only a form of the error to which he is subject. As regards the man of error, he has neither this world nor the next. It should be remembered that griefs do not last for ever and that happiness cannot be had always. [^957] Worldly life with all its vicissitudes and painful incidents, one like me would never adopt. Such a one would not care for desirable objects of enjoyments, and would not think at all of the happiness their possession may bring about, or, indeed, of the griefs that present themselves. [^958] One capable of resting on one's own self would never covet the possessions of others; would not think of gains unacquired, would not feel delighted at the acquisition of even immense wealth; and would not yield to sorrow at the loss of wealth. Neither friends, nor wealth, nor high birth, nor scriptural learning, nor _mantras_, nor energy, can succeed in rescuing one from sorrow in the next world. It is only by conduct that one can attain to felicity there. The Understanding of the man unconversant with Yoga can never be directed towards Emancipation. One unconversant with Yoga can never have happiness. Patience and the resolution to cast off sorrow, these two indicate the advent of happiness. Anything agreeable leads to pleasure. Pleasure induces pride. Pride, again, is productive of sorrow. For these reasons, I avoid all these. Grief, Fear, Pride,—these that stupefy the heart,—and also Pleasure and Pain, I behold as (an unconcerned) witness since my body is endued with life and moves about. [^959] Casting off both wealth and pleasure, and thirst and error, I wander over the earth, freed from grief and every kind of anxiety of heart. Like one that has drunk nectar I have no fear, here or hereafter, of death, or iniquity, or cupidity, or anything of that kind. I have acquired this knowledge, O Brahmana, as the result of my severe and indestructible penances. It is for this reason, O Narada, that grief, even when it comes to me, does not succeed in afflicting me.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘Tell me, O grandsire, what is beneficial for one that is unconversant with the truths of the scriptures, that is always in doubt, and <span id="p335"><sup><small>[ p. 335 ]</small></sup></span> that abstains from self-restraint and the other practices having for their object the knowledge of the Soul.’

“Bhishma said, ‘Worshipping the preceptor, always waiting reverentially on those that are aged, and listening to the scriptures (when recited by up competent Brahmanas),—these are said to be of supreme benefit (to a person like the one thou hast described). In this connection also is cited the old narrative of the discourse between Galava and the celestial Rishi Narada. Once on a time Galava, desirous of obtaining what was for his benefit, addressed Narada freed from error and fatigue, learned in the scriptures, gratified with knowledge, a thorough master of his senses, and with soul devoted to Yoga, and said, ‘Those virtues, O Muni, by the possession of which a person becomes respected in the world, I see, dwell permanently in thee. Thou art freed from error and, as such, it behoveth thee to remove the doubts that fill the minds of men like ourselves that are subject to error and that are unacquainted with the truths of the world. We do not know what we should do, for the declarations of the scriptures generate an inclination for (the acquisition of) Knowledge simultaneously with the inclination for acts. It behoveth thee to discourse to us on these subjects. [^960] O illustrious one, the different _asramas_ approve different courses of conduct.—_This_ is beneficial,—_This_ (other) is beneficial—the scriptures exhort us often in this wise. [^961] Beholding the followers of the four asramas, who are thus exhorted by the scriptures and who fully approve of what the scriptures have laid down for them, thus travelling in diverse courses, and seeing that ourselves also are equally content with our own scriptures, we fail to understand what is truly beneficial. If the scriptures were all uniform, then what is truly beneficial would have become manifest. In consequence, however, of the scriptures being multifarious, that which is truly beneficial becomes invested with mystery. For these reasons, that which is truly beneficial seems to me to be involved in confusion. Do thou then, O illustrious one, discourse to me on the subject. I have approached thee (for this), O, instruct me!’

“Narada said, ‘The Asramas are four in number, O child! All of them serve the purposes for which they have been designed; and the duties they preach differ from one another. Ascertaining them first from well-qualified preceptors, reflect upon them, O Galava! [^962] Behold, the announcements of the merits <span id="p336"><sup><small>[ p. 336 ]</small></sup></span> of those Asramas are varied in respect of their form, divergent in respect of their matter, and contradictory in respect of the observances they embrace. [^963] Observed with gross vision, verily, all the Asramas refuse to clearly yield their true intent (which, of course, is knowledge of Self). Others, however, endued with subtle sight, behold their highest end. [^964] That which is truly beneficial, and about which there is no doubt, _viz_., good offices to friends, and suppression of enemies, and the acquisition of the aggregate of three (_viz_., Religion, Profit, and Pleasure), has been declared by the wise to be supreme excellence. [^965] Abstention from sinful acts, constancy of righteous disposition, good behaviour towards those that are good and pious,—these, without doubt, constitute excellence. Mildness towards all creatures, sincerity of behaviour, and the use of sweet words,—these, without doubt, constitute excellence. An equitable apportionment of what one has among the deities, the _Pitris_, and guests, and adherence to servants,—these, without doubt, constitute excellence. Truthfulness of speech is excellent. The knowledge, however, of truth, is very difficult of acquisition. I say that that is truth which is exceedingly beneficial to creatures. [^966] The renunciation of pride, the suppression of heedlessness, contentment, living by one's own self,—these are said to constitute supreme excellence. The study of the Vedas, and of their branches, according to the well-known rules, and all enquiries and pursuits having for their sake the acquisition of knowledge,—these, without doubt, are excellent. One desirous of achieving what is excellent should never enjoy sound and form and taste and touch and scent, to excess and should not enjoy them for their sake alone. Wandering in the night, sleep during the day, indulgence in idleness, roguery, arrogance, excessive indulgence and total abstention from all indulgence in objects of the senses, should be relinquished by one desirous of achieving what is excellent. [^967] One should not seek self-elevation by depreciating others. Indeed, one should, by one's merits alone, <span id="p337"><sup><small>[ p. 337 ]</small></sup></span> seek distinction over persons that are distinguished but never over those that are inferior. Men really destitute of merit and filled with a sense of self-admiration depreciate men of real merit, by asserting their own virtues and affluence. Swelling with a sense of their own importance, these men, when none interferes with them (for bringing them to a right sense of what they are), regard themselves to be superior to men of real distinction. One possessed of real wisdom and endued with real merits, acquires great fame by abstaining from speaking ill of others and from indulging in self-praise. Flowers shed their pure and sweet fragrance without trumpeting forth their own excellence. Similarly, the effulgent Sun scatters his splendours in the firmament in perfect silence. After the same manner those men blaze in the world with celebrity who by the aid of their intelligence, cast off these and similar other faults and who do not proclaim their own virtues. The fool can never shine in the world by bruiting about his own praise. The man, however, of real merit and learning obtains celebrity even if he be concealed in a pit. Evil words, uttered with whatsoever vigour of voice die out (in no time). Good words, uttered however softly, blaze forth in the world. As the Sun shows his fiery form (in the gem called Suryakanta), even so the multitude of words, of little sense, that fools filled with vanity utter, display only (the meanness of) their hearts. For these reasons, men seek the acquisition of wisdom of various kinds. It seems to me that of all acquisitions that of wisdom is the most valuable. One should not speak until one is asked; nor should one speak when one is asked improperly. Even if possessed of intelligence and knowledge, one should still sit in silence like an idiot (until one is asked to speak and asked in proper form). One should seek to dwell among honest men devoted to righteousness and liberality and the observance of the duties of their own order. One desirous of achieving what is excellent should never dwell in a place where a confusion occurs in the duties of the several orders. [^968] A person may be seen to live who abstains from all works (for earning the means of his living) and who is well-content with whatever is got without exertion. By living amid the righteous, one succeeds in acquiring pure righteousness. After the same manner, one by living amid the sinful, becomes stained with sin. [^969] As the touch of water or fire or the rays of the moon immediately conveys the sensation of cold or heat, after the same manner the impressions of virtue and vice become productive of happiness or misery. They that are eaters of Vighasa eat without taking any notice of the flavours of the edibles placed before them. They, however, that eat carefully discriminating the flavours of the viands prepared for them, should be known as persons still <span id="p338"><sup><small>[ p. 338 ]</small></sup></span> tied by the bonds of action. [^970] The righteous man should leave that place where a Brahmana discourses on duties unto disciples desirous of acquiring knowledge, as based on reasons, of the Soul, but who do not enquire after such knowledge with reverence. [^971] Who, however, will leave that spot where exists in its entirety that behaviour between disciples and preceptors which is consistent with what has been laid down in the scriptures? What learned man desirous of respect being paid to himself will dwell in that place where people bruit about the faults of the learned even when such have no foundation to stand upon? [^972] Who is there that will not leave that place, like a garment whose end has caught fire, where covetous men seek to break down the barriers of virtue? One should remain and dwell in that place, among good men of righteous disposition, where persons endued with humility are engaged in fearlessly practising the duties of religion. There where men practise the duties of religion for the sake of acquiring wealth and other temporal advantages, one should not dwell, for the people of that place are all to be regarded as sinful. One should fly away with all speed from that place, as if from a room in which there is a snake, where the inhabitants, desirous of obtaining the means of life, are engaged in the practice of sinful deeds. One desirous of what is beneficial should, from the beginning, relinquish that act in consequence of which one becomes stretched, as it were, on a bed of thorn and in consequence of which one becomes invested with the desires born of the deeds of past lives. [^973] The righteous man should leave that kingdom where the king and king's officers exercise equal authority and where they are given to the habit of eating before feeding their relatives (when the latter come as guests). [^974] One should dwell in that country where Brahmanas possessed of a knowledge of the scriptures are fed first: where they are always devoted to the due observance of religious duties, and where they are engaged in teaching disciples and officiating at the sacrifices of others. One should unhesitatingly dwell in that country where the sounds Swaha, Swadha, and Vashat are duly and continuously uttered. [^975] One should leave that kingdom, like poisoned <span id="p339"><sup><small>[ p. 339 ]</small></sup></span> meat, where one sees Brahmanas obliged to betake themselves to unholy practices, being tortured by want of the means of life. With a contented heart and deeming all his wishes as already gratified a righteous man should dwell in that country whose inhabitants cheerfully give away before even they are solicited. One should live and move about, among good men devoted to acts of righteousness, in that country where chastisement falleth upon those that are wicked and where respect and good offices are the portion of those that are of subdued and cleansed souls. One should unhesitatingly dwell in that country whose king is devoted to virtue and which the king rules virtuously, casting off desires and possessed of prosperity, and where severe chastisement is dealt to those that visit self-controlled men with the consequences of their wrath, those that act wickedly towards the righteous, those that are given to acts of violence, and those that are covetous. [^976] Kings endued with such a disposition bring about prosperity to those that dwell in their kingdoms when prosperity is on the point of leaving them. [^977] I have thus told thee, O son, in answer to thy enquiry, what is beneficial or excellent. No one can describe, in consequence of its exceedingly high character, what is beneficial or excellent for the Soul. [^978] Many and high will the excellences be, through the observance of the duties laid down for him, of the man who for earning his livelihood during the time of his sojourn here conducts himself in the way indicated above and who devotes his soul to the good of all creatures.’” [^979]

## SECTION CCLXXXIX

“Yudhishthira said, ‘How, O grandsire, should a king like us behave in this world, keeping in view the great object of acquisition? What attributes, again, should he always possess so that he may be freed from attachments?’

“Bhishma said, ‘I shall in this connection recite to thee the old narrative that was uttered by Arishtanemi unto Sagara who had sought his counsel.’

“Sagara said, ‘What is that good, O Brahmana, by doing which one may <span id="p340"><sup><small>[ p. 340 ]</small></sup></span> enjoy felicity here? How, indeed, may one avoid grief and agitation? I wish to know all this!’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus addressed by Sagara, Arishtanemi of Tarkshya's race, conversant with all the scriptures, regarding the questioner to be every way deserving of his instructions, said these words, [^980] 'The felicity of Emancipation is true felicity in the world. The man of ignorance knows it not, attached as he is to children and animals and possessed of wealth and corn. An understanding that is attached to worldly objects and a mind suffering from thirst,—these two baffle all skilful treatment. The ignorant man who is bound in the chains of affection is incapable of acquiring Emancipation. [^981] I shall presently speak to thee of all the bonds that spring from the affections. Hear them with attention. Indeed, they are capable of being heard with profit by one that is possessed of knowledge. Having procreated children in due time and married them when they become young men, and having ascertained them to be competent for earning their livelihood, do thou free thyself from all attachments and rove about in happiness. When thou seest thy dearly-cherished wife grown old in years and attached to the son she has brought forth, do thou leave her in time, keeping in view the highest object of acquisition (_viz_., Emancipation). Whether thou obtainest a son or not, having during the first years of thy life duly enjoyed with thy senses the objects that are addressed to them, free thyself from attachments and rove about in happiness. Having indulged the senses with their objects, thou shouldst suppress the desire of further indulging them. Freeing thyself then from attachments, thou shouldst rove in felicity, contenting thyself with what is obtained without effort and previous calculation, and casting an equal eye upon all creatures and objects. [^982] Thus, O son, have I told thee in brief (of what the way is for freeing thyself from attachments). Hear me now, for I shall presently tell thee, in detail, the desirability of the acquisition of Emancipation. [^983] Those persons who live in this world freed from attachments and fear, succeed in obtaining happiness. Those persons, however, who are attached to worldly objects, without doubt, meet with destruction. Worms and ants (like men) are engaged in the acquisition of food and are seen to die in the search. They that are freed from attachments are happy, while they that are attached to worldly objects meet with destruction. If thou desirest to attain to Emancipation thou shouldst never bestow thy thoughts on thy relatives, thinking,—How shall these exist without me?—A living creature takes birth by himself, and grows by himself, and obtains happiness and misery, and death by himself. In this world people enjoy and obtain food and raiment and other acquisitions earned by their parents or themselves. This is the result of the acts of past lives, for <span id="p341"><sup><small>[ p. 341 ]</small></sup></span> nothing can be had in this life which is not the result of the past. All creatures live on the Earth, protected by their own acts, and obtaining their food as the result of what is ordained by Him who assigns the fruits of acts. A man is but a lump of clay, and is always himself completely dependent on other forces. One, therefore, being oneself so, in firm, what rational consideration can one have for protecting and feeding one's relatives? When thy relatives are carried away by Death in thy very sight and in spite of even thy utmost efforts to save them, that circumstance alone should awaken thee. In the every lifetime of thy relatives and before thy own duty is completed of feeding and protecting them, thyself mayst meet with death and abandon them. After thy relatives have been carried away from this world by death, thou canst not know what becomes of them there,—that is, whether they meet with happiness or misery. This circumstance ought to awaken thee. When in consequence of the fruits of their own acts thy relatives succeed in maintaining themselves in this world whether thou livest or diest, reflecting on this thou shouldst do what is for thy own good. [^984] When this is known to be the case, who in the world is to be regarded as whose? Do thou, therefore, set thy heart on the attainment of Emancipation. Listen now to what more I shall say unto thee. That man of firm Soul is certainly emancipated who has conquered hunger and thirst and such other states of the body, as also wrath and cupidity and error. That man is always emancipated who does not forget himself, through folly, by indulging in gambling and drinking and concubinage and the chase. That man who is really touched by sorrow in consequence of the necessity there is of eating every day and every night for supporting life, is said to be cognisant of the faults of life. One who, as the result of careful reflection, regards his repeated births to be only due to sexual congress with women, is held to be freed from attachments. That man is certainly emancipated who knows truly the nature of the birth, the destruction, and the exertion (or acts) of living creatures. That man becomes certainly freed who regards (as worthy of his acceptance) only a handful of corn, for the support of life, from amidst millions upon millions of carts loaded with grain, and who disregards the difference between a shed of bamboo and reeds and a palatial mansion. [^985] That man becomes certainly freed who beholds the <span id="p342"><sup><small>[ p. 342 ]</small></sup></span> world to be afflicted by death and disease and famine. [^986] Indeed, one who beholds the world to be such succeeds in becoming contented; while one who fails to behold the world in such a light, meets with destruction. That man who is contented with only a little is regarded as freed. That man who beholds the world as consisting of eaters and edibles (and himself as different from both) and who is never touched by pleasure and pain which are born of illusion, is regarded as emancipate. That man who regards a soft bed on a fine bedstead and the hard soil as equal, and who regards good _sali_ rice and hard thick rice as equal, is emancipated. That man who regards linen and cloth made of grass as equal, and in whose estimation cloth of silk and barks of trees are the same, and who sees no difference between clean sheep-skin and unclean leather, is emancipated That man who looks upon this world as the result of the combination of the five primal essences, and who behaves himself in this world, keeping this notion foremost, is emancipated. That man who regards pleasure and pain as equal, and gain and loss as on a par, in whose estimation victory and defeat differ not, to whom like and dislike are the same, and who is unchanged under fear and anxiety, is wholly emancipated. That man who regards his body which has so many imperfections to be only a mass of blood, urine and excreta, as also of disorders and diseases, is emancipated. That man becomes emancipated who always recollects that this body, when overtaken by decrepitude, becomes assailed by wrinkles and white hairs and leanness and paleness of complexion and a bending of the form. That man who recollects his body to be liable to loss of virility, and weakness of sight, and deafness, and loss of strength, is emancipated. That man who knows that the very Rishis, the deities, and the Asuras are beings that have to depart from their respective spheres to other regions, is emancipated. That man who knows that thousands of kings possessed of even great offence and power have departed from this earth, succeeds in becoming emancipated. That man who knows that in this world the acquisition of objects is always difficult, that pain is abundant, and that the maintenance of relatives is ever attended with pain, becomes emancipated. [^987] Beholding the abundant faults of children and of other men, who is there that would not adore Emancipation? That man who, awakened by the scriptures and the experience of the world, beholds every human concern in this world to be unsubstantial, becomes emancipated. Bearing in mind those words of mine, do thou conduct thyself like one that has become emancipated, whether it is a life of domesticity that thou wouldst lead or pursue emancipation without suffering thy understanding to be confounded.‘ [^988] Hearing these words of his <span id="p343"><sup><small>[ p. 343 ]</small></sup></span> with attention, Sagara, that lord of earth, acquired those virtues which are productive of Emancipation and continued, with their aid to rule his subjects.’”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘This curiosity, O sire, is always dwelling in my mind. O grandsire of the Kurus, I desire to hear everything about it from thee. Why was the celestial Rishi, the high-souled Usanas, called also Kavi engaged in doing what was agreeable to the Asuras and disagreeable to the deities? Why was he engaged in diminishing the energy of the deities? Why were the Danavas always engaged in hostilities with the foremost of the deities? Possessed of the splendour of an immortal, for what reason did Usanas obtain the name of Sukra? How also did he acquire such superior excellence? Tell me all about these things. Though possessed of great energy, why does he not succeed in travelling to the centre of the firmament? I desire, O grandsire, to learn everything about all these matters.’ [^989]

“Bhishma said, ‘Listen, O king, with attention to all this as it occurred actually. O sinless one, I shall narrate these matters to thee as I have heard and understood them. Of firm vows and honoured by all, Usanas, that descendant of Bhrigu's race, became engaged in doing what was disagreeable to the deities for an adequate cause. [^990] The royal Kuvera, the chief of the Yakshas and the Rakshasas, is the lord of the treasury of Indra, that master of the universe. [^991] The great ascetic Usanas, crowned with Yoga-success, entered the person of Kuvera, and depriving the lord of treasures of his liberty by means of Yoga, robbed him of all his wealth. [^992] Seeing his wealth taken away from him, the lord of treasures became highly displeased. Filled with anxiety, and his wrath also being excited, he went to that foremost of gods, _viz_., Mahadeva. Kuvera, represented the matter unto Siva of immeasurable energy, that first of gods, fierce and amiable, and possessed of various forms. And he said, ‘Usanas, having spiritualised himself by Yoga entered my form and depriving myself of liberty, has taken away all my wealth. Having by <span id="p344"><sup><small>[ p. 344 ]</small></sup></span> Yoga entered my body he has again left it.’ Hearing these words, Maheswara of supreme Yoga-powers became filled with rage. His eyes, O king, became blood-red, and taking up his lance he waited (ready to strike down Usanas). Indeed, having taken up that foremost of weapons, the great god began to say, ‘Where is he? Where is he?’ Meanwhile, Usanas, having ascertained the purpose of Mahadeva (through Yoga-power) from a distance, waited in silence. Indeed, having ascertained the fact of the wrath of the high-souled Maheswara of superior Yoga-power, the puissant Usanas began to reflect as to whether he should go to Maheswara or fly away or remain where he was. Thinking, with the aid of his severe penances, of the high-souled Mahadeva, Usanas of soul crowned with Yoga-success, placed himself on the point of Mahadeva's lance. The bow-armed Rudra, understanding that Usanas, whose penances had become successful and who had converted himself into the form of pure Knowledge, was staying at the point of his lance (and finding that he was unable to hurl the lance at one who was upon it), bent that weapon with hand. When the fierce-armed and puissant Mahadeva of immeasurable energy had thus bent his lance (into the form of a bow), that weapon came to be called from that time by the name of _Pinaka_. [^993] The lord of Uma, beholding Bhargava thus brought upon the palm of his hand, opened his mouth. The chief of the gods then threw Bhargava into his mouth and swallowed him at once. The puissant and high-souled Usanas of Bhrigu's race, entering the stomach of Maheswara, began to wander there.’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘How, O king, could Usanas succeed in wandering within the stomach of that foremost of superior intelligence? What also did that illustrious god do while the Brahmana was within his stomach?’ [^994]

“Bhishma said, ‘In days of yore (having swallowed up Usanas), Mahadeva of severe vows entered the waters and remained there like an immovable stake of wood, O king, for millions of years (engaged in Yoga-meditation). His Yoga penances of the austerest type having been over, he rose from the mighty lake. Then that primeval god of the gods, _viz_., the eternal Brahman, approached him, and enquired after the progress of his penances and after his welfare. The deity having the bull for his emblem answered, saying, ‘My penances have been well-practised.’ Of inconceivable soul, possessed of great intelligence, and ever devoted to the religion of truth, Sankara saw that Usanas within his stomach had become greater in consequence of those penances of his. [^995] That foremost of Yogins (_viz_., Usanas), rich with that wealth of penances and the wealth (he had appropriated from Kuvera), shone brightly in the three worlds, endued with great energy. [^996] After this, Mahadeva <span id="p345"><sup><small>[ p. 345 ]</small></sup></span> armed with Pinaka, that soul of Yoga, once more betook himself to Yoga-meditation. Usanas, however, filled with anxiety, began to wander within the stomach of the great god. The great ascetic began to hymn the praises of the god from where he was, desirous of finding an outlet for escape. Rudra, however, having stopped all his outlets, prevented him from coming out. The great ascetic Usanas, however, O chastiser of foes, from within Mahadeva's stomach, repeatedly addressed the god, saying, ‘Show me thy kindness!’ Unto him Mahadeva said, ‘Go out through my urethra.’ He had stopped up all other outlets of his body. Confined on every side and unable to find out the outlet indicated, the ascetic began to wander hither and thither, burning all the while with Mahadeva's energy. At last he found the outlet and issued through it. In consequence of this fact he came to be called by the name of Sukra, and it is in consequence of that fact he also became unable to attain (in course of his wandering) the central point of the firmament. Beholding him come out of his stomach and shining brightly with energy, Bhava, filled with anger, stood with lance uplifted in his hand. The goddess Uma then interposed and forbade the angry lord of all creatures, _viz_., her spouse, to slay the Brahmana. And in consequence of Uma's having thus prevented her lord from accomplishing his purpose the ascetic Usanas (from the day) became the son of the goddess.’

“The goddess said, ‘This Brahmana no longer deserves to be slain by thee. He has become my son. O god, one who comes out of thy stomach does not deserve slaughter at thy hands.’

“Bhishma continued, ”

“Yudhishthira said, ‘O thou of mighty arms, tell me, after this what is beneficial for us. O grandsire, I am never satiated with thy words which seem to me like Amrita. What are those good acts, O best of men, by accomplishing which a man succeeds in obtaining what is for his highest benefit both here and hereafter, O giver of boons!’

“Bhishma said, 

“Parasara said, ‘Righteousness earned by acts is supreme benefit both in this world and the next. The sages of the old have said that there is nothing higher than Righteousness. By accomplishing the duties of righteousness a man becomes honoured in heaven. The Righteousness, again, of embodied creatures, O best of kings, consists in the ordinance (laid down in the scriptures) on the subject of acts. [^998] All good men belonging to the several modes of life, establishing their faith on that righteousness, accomplish their respective duties. [^999] Four methods of living, O child, have been ordained in this world. (Those four methods are the acceptance of gifts for Brahmanas; the realisation of taxes for Kshatriyas; agriculture for Vaisyas; and service of the three other classes for the Sudras). Wherever men live the means of support come to them of themselves. Accomplishing by various ways acts that are virtuous or sinful (for the purpose of earning their means of support), living creatures, when dissolved into their constituent elements attain to diverse ends. [^1000] As vessels of white brass, when steeped in liquefied gold or silver, catch the hue of these metals, even so a living creature, who is completely dependent upon the acts of his past lives takes his colour from the character of those acts. Nothing can sprout forth without a seed. No one can obtain happiness without having accomplished acts capable of leading to happiness. When one's body is dissolved away (into its constituent elements), one succeeds in attaining to happiness only in consequence of the good acts of previous lives. The sceptic argues, O child, saying, I do not behold that anything in this world is the result of destiny or the virtuous and sinful acts of past lives. Inference cannot establish the existence or operation of destiny. [^1001] The deities, the Gandharvas and the Danavas have become what they are in consequence of their own nature (and not of their acts of past lives). People never recollect in their next lives the acts done by them in previous ones. For explaining the acquisition of fruits in any particular life people seldom name the four kinds of acts alleged to have been accomplished in past lives. [^1002] The declarations <span id="p347"><sup><small>[ p. 347 ]</small></sup></span> having the Vedas for their authority have been made for regulating the conduct of men in this world, and for tranquillizing the minds of men. These (the sceptic says), O child, cannot represent the utterances of men possessed of true wisdom. This opinion is wrong. In reality, one obtains the fruits of whatever among the four kinds of acts one does with the eye, the mind, the tongue, and muscles. [^1003] As the fruit of his acts, O king, a person sometimes obtains happiness wholly, sometimes misery in the same way, and sometimes happiness and misery blended together. Whether righteous or sinful, acts are never destroyed (except by enjoyment or endurance of their fruits). [^1004] Sometimes, O child, the happiness due to good acts remains concealed and covered in such a way that it does not display itself in the case of the person who is sinking in life's ocean till his sorrows disappear. After sorrow has beep exhausted (by endurance), one begins to enjoy (the fruits of) one's good acts. And know, O king, that upon the exhaustion of the fruits of good acts, those of sinful acts begin to manifest themselves. Self-restraint, forgiveness, patience, energy, contentment, truthfulness of speech, modesty, abstention from injury, freedom from the evil practices called _vyasana_, and cleverness,—these are productive of happiness. No creature is eternally subject to the fruits of his good or bad acts. The man possessed of wisdom should always strive to collect and fix his mind. One never has to enjoy or endure the good and bad acts of another. Indeed, one enjoys and endures the fruits of only those acts that one does oneself. The person that casts off both happiness and misery walks along a particular path (the path, _viz_., of knowledge). Those men, however, O king, who suffer themselves to be attached to all worldly objects, tread along a path that is entirely different. A person should rot himself do that act which, if done by another, would call down his censure. Indeed, by doing an act that one censures in others, one incurs ridicule. A Kshatriya bereft of courage, a Brahmana that takes every kind of food, a Vaisya unendued with exertion (in respect of agriculture and other moneymaking pursuits), a Sudra that is idle (and, therefore, averse to labour), a learned person without good behaviour, one of high birth but destitute of righteous conduct, a Brahmana fallen away from truth, a woman that is unchaste and wicked, a Yogin endued with attachments, one that cooks food for one's own self, an ignorant person employed in making a discourse, <span id="p348"><sup><small>[ p. 348 ]</small></sup></span> a kingdom without a king and a king that cherishes no affection for his subjects and who is destitute of Yoga,—these all, O king, are deserving of pity!'” [^1005]

“Parasara said, ‘That man who, having obtained this car, _viz_., his body endued with mind, goes on, curbing with the reins of-knowledge the steeds represented by the objects of the senses, should certainly be regarded as possessed of intelligence. The homage (in the form of devotion to and concentrated meditation on the Supreme) by a person whose mind is dependent on itself and who has cast off the means of livelihood is worthy of high praise,—that homage, namely, O regenerate one, which is the result of instructions received from one who has succeeded in transcending acts but not obtained from the mutual discussion of men in the same state of progress. [^1006] Having obtained the allotted period of life, O king, with such difficulty, one should not diminish it (by indulgence of the senses). On the other hand, man should always exert, by righteous acts for his gradual advancement. [^1007] Among the six different colours that Jiva attains at different periods of his existence, he who falls away from a superior colour deserves obloquy and censure. Hence, one that has attained to the result of good acts should conduct oneself in such a way as to avoid all acts stained by the quality of Rajas. [^1008] Man <span id="p349"><sup><small>[ p. 349 ]</small></sup></span> attains to a superior colour by righteous acts. Unable to acquire a superior hue, for such acquisition is extremely difficult, a person, by doing sinful acts only slays himself (by sinking into hell and falling down into an inferior colour). All sinful acts that are committed unconsciously or in ignorance are destroyed by penances. A sinful act, however, that is committed knowingly, produces much sorrow. Hence, one should never commit sinful acts which have for their fruit only sorrow. The man of intelligence would never do an act that is sinful in character even if it leads to the greatest advantage, just as a person that is pure would never touch a Chandala. [^1009] How miserable is the fruit I see of sinful acts! Through sin the very vision of the sinner becomes perverse, and he confounds his body and its unstable accompaniments with the Soul. [^1010] That foolish man who does not succeed in betaking himself to Renunciation in this world becomes afflicted with great grief when he departs to the next world. [^1011] An uncoloured cloth, when dirty, can be cleaned, but not a piece of cloth that is dyed with black; even so, O king, listen to me with care, is it the case with sin. That man who, having knowingly committed sin, acts righteously for expiating that sin, has to enjoy and endure the fruits of his good and bad acts separately. [^1012] The utterers of Brahma maintain, under the authority of what has been laid down in the Vedas, that all acts of injury committed in ignorance are cancelled by acts of righteousness. A sin, however, that is committed consciously is never cancelled by righteousness. Thus say the regenerate utterers of Brahma who are conversant with the scriptures of Brahmana. As regards myself, my view is that whatever acts are done, be they righteous or sinful, be they done knowingly or otherwise, remain (and are never destroyed unless their fruits are enjoyed or endured). [^1013] Whatever acts are done by the mind with full deliberation, produce, according to their grossness or subtility, fruits that are gross or subtile. [^1014] Those acts, however, O thou of righteous soul, which are fraught with great injury, if done in ignorance, do without fail produce consequences and even consequences that lead to hell, with this difference that those consequences are disproportionate <span id="p350"><sup><small>[ p. 350 ]</small></sup></span> in point of gravity to the acts that produce them. [^1015] As to those acts (of a doubtful or unrighteous nature) that may be done by the deities or ascetics of reputation, a righteous man should never do their like or, informed of them, should never censure them. [^1016] That man who, reflecting with his mind, O king, and ascertaining his own ability, accomplishes righteous acts, certainly obtains what is for his benefit. Water poured into an unbaked vessel gradually becomes less and finally escapes altogether. If kept, however, in a baked vessel, it remains without its quantity being diminished. After the same manner, acts done without reflection with the aid of the understanding do not become beneficial; while acts done with judgment remain with undiminished excellence and yield happiness as their result. If into a vessel containing water other water be poured, the water that was originally there increases in quantity; even so all acts done with judgment, be they equitable or otherwise, only add to one's stock of righteousness. A king should subjugate his foes and all who seek to assert their superiority, and he should properly rule and protect his subjects. One should ignite one's sacred fires and pour libations on them in diverse sacrifices, and retiring in the woods into either one's middle or old age, should live there (practising the duties of the two last modes of life). Endued with self-restraint, and possessed of righteous behaviour, one should look upon all creatures as on one's own self. One should again reverence one's superiors. By the practice of truth and of good conduct, O king, one is sure to obtain happiness.’”

“Parasara said, ‘Nobody in this world does good to another. Nobody is seen to make gifts to others. All persons are seen to act for their own selves. People are seen to cast off their very parents and their uterine brothers when these cease to be affectionate. What need be said then or relatives of other degrees? [^1017] Gifts to a distinguished person and acceptance of the gifts made by a distinguished person both lead to equal merit. Of these two acts, however, <span id="p351"><sup><small>[ p. 351 ]</small></sup></span> the making of a gift is superior to the acceptance of a gift. [^1018] That wealth which is acquired by proper means and increased also by proper means, should be protected with care for the sake of acquiring virtue. This is an accepted truth. One desirous of acquiring righteousness should never earn wealth by means involving injury to others. One should accomplish one's acts according to one's power, without zealously pursuing wealth. By giving water, whether cold or heated by fire, with a devoted mind, unto a (thirsty) guest, according to the best of one's power, one earns the merit that attaches to the act of giving food to a hungry man. The high-souled Rantideva obtained success in all the worlds by worshipping the ascetics with offerings of only roots and fruits leaves. The royal son of Sivi also won the highest regions of felicity by having gratified Surya along with his companion with offerings of the same kind. All men, by taking birth, incur debts to gods, guests, servants, Pitris, and their own selves. Everyone should, therefore, do his best for freeing himself from those debts. One frees oneself from one's debt to the great Rishis by studying the Vedas. One pays off one's debts to the gods by performing sacrifices. By performing the rites of the Sraddha one is freed from one's debts to the Pitris. One pays off one's debt to one's fellowmen by doing good offices to them. One pays off the debts one owes to one's own self by listening to Vedic recitations and reflecting on their import, by eating the remnants of sacrifices, and by supporting one's body. One should duty discharge all the acts, from the beginning, that one owes to one's servants. Though destitute of wealth, men are seen to attain to success by great exertions. [^1019] Munis by duly adoring the deities and by duty pouring libations of clarified butter on the sacred fire, have been seen to attain to ascetic success. Richika's son became the son of Vishwamitra. By adoring the deities who have shares in sacrificial offerings, with Richs (he attained to success in after life). Usanas became Sukra by having gratified the god of gods. Indeed., by hymning the praises of the goddess (Uma), he sports in the firmament, endued with great splendour. [^1020] Then, again, Asita and Devala, and Narada and Parvata, and Karkshivat, and Jamadagni's son Rama, and Tandya possessed of cleansed soul, and Vasishtha, and Jamadagni, and Viswamitra and Atri, and Bharadwaja, and Harismasru, and Kundadhara, and Srutasravas,—these great Rishis, by adoring Vishnu with concentrated minds with the aid of Richs, and by penances, succeeded in attaining to success through the grace of that great deity endued with intelligence. Many undeserving men, by adoring that good deity, obtained great distinction. One should not seek for advancement by achieving any wicked or censurable act. That wealth which is earned by righteous ways is true wealth. Fie on that wealth, however, which is earned by unrighteous means. Righteousness is eternal. It should never, in this world, be <span id="p352"><sup><small>[ p. 352 ]</small></sup></span> abandoned from desire of wealth. That righteous-souled person who keeps his sacred fire and offers his daily adorations to the deities is regarded as the foremost of righteous persons. All the Vedas, O foremost of kings, are established on the three sacred fires (called Dakshina, Garhapatya, and Ahavaniya). That Brahmana is said to possess the sacred fire whose acts exist in their entirety. It is better to at once abandon the sacred fire than to keep it, abstaining the while from acts. The sacred fire, the mother, the father who has begotten, and the preceptor, O tiger among men, should all be duly waited upon and served with humility. That man who, casting off all feelings of pride, humbly waits upon and serves them that are venerable for age, who is possessed of learning and destitute of lust, who looketh upon all creatures with an eye of love, who has no wealth, who is righteous in his acts, and who is destitute of the desire of inflicting any kind of harm (upon any one), that truly respectable man is worshipped in this world by those that are good and pious.’” [^1021]


## SECTION CCXCIV

“Parasara said, ‘The lowest order, it is proper, should derive their sustenance from the three other orders. Such service, rendered with affection and reverence, makes them righteous. [^1022] If the ancestors of any Sudra were not engaged in service, he should not still engage himself in any other occupation (than service). Truly, he should apply himself to service as his occupation. In my opinion, it is proper for them to associate, under all circumstances, with good men devoted to righteousness, but never with those that are wicked. As in the Eastern hills, jewels and metals blaze with greater splendour in consequence of their adjacence to the Sun, even so the lowest order blazes with splendour in consequence of their association with the good. A piece of white cloth assumes that hue with which it is dyed. Even such is the case with Sudras. [^1023] Hence also, one should attach oneself to all good qualities but never to qualities that are evil. The life of human beings in this world is fleeting and transitory. That wise man who, in happiness as also in misery, achieves only what is good, is regarded as a true observer of the scriptures. That man who is endued with intelligence would never do an act which is dissociated from virtue, however high may the advantages be of that act. Indeed, such an act is not regarded as truly beneficial. That lawless <span id="p353"><sup><small>[ p. 353 ]</small></sup></span> king who, snatching thousands of kine from their lawful owners, gives them away (unto deserving persons), acquires no fruit (from that act of giving) beyond an empty sound (expressive of the act he does). On the other hand, he incurs the sin of theft. The Self-born at first created the Being called Dhatri held in universal respect. Dhatri created a son who was engaged in upholding all the worlds. [^1024] Worshipping that deity, the Vaisya employs himself, for the means of his support, in agriculture and the rearing of cattle. The Kshatriyas should employ themselves in the task of protecting all the other classes. The Brahmanas should only enjoy. As regards the Sudras, they should engage themselves in the task of humbly and honestly collecting together the articles that are to be offered in sacrifices, and in cleaning altars and other places where sacrifices are to be performed. If each order acts in this way, righteousness would not suffer any diminution. If righteousness is preserved in its entirety, all creatures inhabiting the earth would be happy. Beholding the happiness of all creatures on earth, the deities in heaven become filled with gladness. Hence, that king who, agreeably to the duties laid down for his order, protects the other classes, becomes worthy of respect. Similarly, the Brahmana that is employed in studying the scriptures, the Vaisya that is engaged in earning wealth, and the Sudra that is always engaged in serving the three other classes with concentrated attention, become objects of respect. By conducting themselves in the other ways, O chief of men, each order is said to fall away from virtue. Keeping aside gifts by thousands, even twenty _cowries_ that one may give painfully, having earned them righteously, will be productive of the great benefit. Those persons, O king, who make gifts unto Brahmanas after reverencing them duly, reap excellent fruits commensurate with those gifts. That gift is highly prized which the donor makes after seeking out the donee and honouring him properly. That gift is middling which the donor makes upon solicitation. That gift, however, which is made contemptuously and without any reverence, is said to be very inferior (in point of merit). Even this is what those utterers of the truth, _viz_., the sages, say. While sinking in this ocean of life, man should always seek to cross that ocean by various means. Indeed, he should so exert himself that he might be freed from the bonds of this world. The Brahmana shines by self restraint; the Kshatriya by victory; the Vaisya by wealth; while the Sudra always shines in glory through cleverness in serving (the three other orders).’”

“Parasara said, ‘In the Brahmana, wealth acquired by acceptance of gifts, in the Kshatriya that won by victory in battle, in the Vaisya that obtained by <span id="p354"><sup><small>[ p. 354 ]</small></sup></span> following the duties laid down for his order, and in the Sudra that earned by serving the three other orders, however small its measure, is worthy of praise, and spent for the acquisition of virtue is productive of great benefits. The Sudra is said to be the constant servitor of the three other classes. If the Brahmana, pressed for a living, betakes himself to the duties of either the Kshatriya or the Vaisya, he does not fall off from righteousness. When, however, the Brahmana betakes himself to the duties of the lowest order, then does he certainly fall off. When the Sudra is unable to obtain his living by service of the three other orders, then trade, rearing of cattle, and the practice of the mechanical arts are lawful for him to follow. Appearance on the boards of a theatre and disguising oneself in various forms, exhibition of puppets, the sale of spirits and meat, and trading in iron and leather, should never be taken up for purposes of a living by one who had never before been engaged in those professions every one of which is regarded as censurable in the world. It hath been heard by us that if one engaged in them can abandon them, one then acquires great merit. When one that has become successful in life behaves sinfully in consequence of one's mind being filled with arrogance, one's acts under such circumstances can never pass for authority. It is heard in the Puranas that formerly mankind were self-restrained; that they held righteousness in great esteem; that the practices they followed for livelihood were all consistent with propriety and the injunctions laid down in the scriptures: and that the only punishment that was required for chastising them when they went wrong was the crying of fie on them. [^1025] At the time of which we speak, O king, Righteousness, and nothing else, was much applauded among men. Having achieved great progress in righteousness, men in those days worshipped only all good qualities that they saw. The _Asuras_, however, O child, could not bear that righteousness which prevailed in the world. Multiplying (in both number and energy), the Asuras (in the form of Lust and Wrath) entered the bodies of men. Then was pride generated in men that is so destructive of righteousness. From pride arose arrogance, and from arrogance arose wrath. When men thus became overwhelmed with wrath, conduct implying modesty and shame disappeared from them, and then they were overcome by heedlessness. Afflicted by heedlessness, they could no longer see as before, and as the consequence thereof they began to oppress one another and thereby acquire wealth without any compunction. When men became such, the punishment of only crying fie on offenders failed to be of any effect. Men, showing no reverence for either the gods or Brahmanas, began to indulge their senses to their fill. [^1026] At that time the deities <span id="p355"><sup><small>[ p. 355 ]</small></sup></span> repaired to that foremost of gods, _viz_., Siva, possessed of patience, of multiform aspect, and endued with the foremost of attributes, and sought his protection. The deities imparted unto him their conjoined energy, and thereupon the great god, with a single shaft, felled on the earth those three Asuras, _viz_., Desire, Wrath, and Cupidity, who were staying in the firmament, along with their very habitations. [^1027] The fierce chief of those Asuras possessed of fierce, prowess, who had struck the Devas with terror, was also slain by Mahadeva armed with the lance. [^1028] When this chief of the Asuras was slain, men once more obtained their proper natures, and once more began to study the Vedas and the other scriptures as was in former times. Then the seven ancient Rishis came forward and installed Vasava as the chief of the gods and the ruler of heaven. And they took upon themselves the task of holding the rod of chastisement over mankind. After the seven Rishis came king Viprithu (to rule mankind), and many other kings, all belonging to the Kshatriya order for separately ruling separate groups of human beings. (When Mahadeva dispelled all evil passions from the minds of creatures) there were, in those ancient times, certain elderly men from whose minds all wicked feelings did not fly away. Hence, in consequence of that wicked state of their minds and of those incidents that were connected with it, there appeared many kings of terrible prowess who began to indulge in only such acts as were fit for Asuras. Those human beings that are exceedingly foolish adhere to those wicked acts, establish them as authorities, and follow them in practice to this day. [^1029] For this reason, O king, I say unto thee, having reflected properly with the aid of the scriptures, that one should abstain from all acts that are fraught with injury or malice and seek to acquire a knowledge of the Soul. [^1030]The man possessed of wisdom would not seek wealth for the performance of religious rites by ways that are unrighteous and that involve an abandonment of morality. Wealth earned by such means can never prove beneficial. Do thou then become a Kshatriya of this kind. Do thou restrain thy senses, be agreeable to thy friends, and cherish, according to the duties of thy order, thy subjects, servants, and children. Through the union of both prosperity and adversity (in man's life), there arise friendships and animosities. <span id="p356"><sup><small>[ p. 356 ]</small></sup></span> Thousands and thousands of existences are continually revolving (in respect of every Jiva), and in every mode of Jiva's existence these must occur. [^1031] For this reason, be thou attached to good qualities of every kind, but never to faults. Such is the character of good qualities that if the most foolish person, bereft of every virtue, hears himself praised for any good quality, he becomes filled with joy. Virtue and sin exist, O king, only among men. These do not exist among creatures other than man. One should therefore, whether in need of food and other necessaries of life or transcending such need, be of virtuous disposition, acquire knowledge, always look upon all creatures as one's own self, and abstain totally from inflicting any kind of injury. When one's mind becomes divested of desire, and when all Darkness is dispelled from it, it is then that one succeeds in obtaining what is auspicious.’”

“Parasara said, ‘I have now discoursed to thee on what the ordinances are of the duties in respect of one that leads the domestic mode of life. I shall now speak to thee of the ordinances about penances. Listen to me as I discourse on the topic. It is generally seen, O king, that in consequence of sentiments fraught with Rajas and Tamas, the sense of meum, born of attachment, springs up in the heart of the householder. Betaking oneself to the domestic mode of life, one acquires kine, fields, wealth of diverse kinds, spouses, children, and servants. One that becomes observant of this mode of life continually casts one's eye upon these objects. Under these circumstances, one's attachments and aversions increase, and one ceases to regard one's (transitory) possessions as eternal and indestructible. When a person becomes overwhelmed by attachment and aversion, and yields himself up to the mastery of earthly objects, the desire of enjoyment then seizes him, taking its rise from heedlessness, O king. Thinking that person to be blessed who has the largest share of enjoyments in this world, the man devoted to enjoyment does not, in consequence of his attachment thereto, see that there is any other happiness besides what waits upon the gratification of the senses. Overwhelmed with cupidity that results from such attachment, he then seeks to increase the number of his relatives and attendants, and for gratifying these latter he seeks to increase his wealth by every means in his power. Filled with affection for children, such a person commits, for the sake of acquiring wealth, acts that he knows to be evil, and gives way to grief if his wealth be lost. Having earned honours and always guarding against the defeat of his plans, he betakes himself to such means as would gratify his desire of enjoyment. At last he <span id="p357"><sup><small>[ p. 357 ]</small></sup></span> meets with destruction as the inevitable consequence of the conduct he pursues. It is well-known, however, that true felicity is theirs that a e endued with intelligence, that are utterers of the eternal Brahma, that seek to accomplish only acts that are auspicious and beneficial, and that abstain from all acts that are optional and spring from desire alone. [^1032] From loss of all such objects in which are centred our affections, from loss of wealth, O king, and from the tyranny of physical diseases add mental anguish, a person falls into despair. From this despair arises art awakening of the soul. From such awakening proceeds study of the Scriptures. From contemplation of the import of the scriptures, O king, one sees the value of penance. A person possessed of the knowledge of what is essential and what accidental, O king, is very rare,—he, that is, who seeks to undergo penances, impressed with the truth that the happiness one derives from the possession of such agreeable objects as spouses and children leads ultimately to misery. [^1033] Penances, O child, are for all. They are ordained for even the lowest order of men (_viz_., Sudras). Penances set the self-restrained man having the mastery over all his senses on the way to heaven. It was through penances that the puissant Lord of all creatures, O, king, observing vows at particular intervals created all existent objects. The Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, Agni, the Aswins, the Maruts, the Viswedevas, the Saddhyas, the Pitris, the Maruts, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the other denizens of heaven, and, indeed, all other celestials whatever, O child, have all been crowned with success through their penances. Those Brahmanas whom Brahmana created at the outset, succeeded through their penances in honouring not the Earth alone but the heaven also in which they roved at pleasure. In this world of mortals, they that are kings, and those others that are householders born in high families, have all become what they are only in consequence of their penances. [^1034] The silken robes they wear, the excellent ornaments that adorn their persons, the animals and vehicles they ride, and the seats they use are all the result of their penances. The many charming and beautiful women, numbering by thousands, that they enjoy, and their residence in palatial mansions, are all due to their penances. Costly beds and diverse kinds of delicious viands become theirs that act righteously. There is nothing in the three worlds, O scorcher of foes, that penances cannot attain. Even those that are destitute of true knowledge win Renunciation as the consequence of their penances. [^1035] Whether in affluent circumstances or miserable, a person should cast off <span id="p358"><sup><small>[ p. 358 ]</small></sup></span> cupidity, reflecting on the scriptures, with the aid of his Mind and understanding, O best of kings. Discontent is productive of misery. (Discontent is the result of cupidity). Cupidity leadeth to the stupefaction of the senses. The senses being stupefied, one's wisdom disappears like knowledge not kept up by continued application. When one's wisdom disappears, one fails to discriminate what is proper from what is improper. Hence, when one's happiness is destroyed (and one becomes subject to misery) one should practise the austerest of penances. [^1036] That which is agreeable is called happiness. That which is disagreeable is said to be misery. When penances are practised, the result is happiness. When they are not practised, the result is misery. Behold the fruits of practising and abstaining from penances! [^1037] By practising stainless penances, people always meet with auspicious consequences of every kind, enjoy all good things, and attain to great fame. [^1038] He, however, who by abandoning (stainless penances), betakes himself to penances from desire of fruit, meets with many disagreeable consequences, and disgrace and sorrow of diverse kinds, as the fruits thereof, all of which have worldly possessions for their cause. [^1039] Notwithstanding the desirability of practising righteousness, penances, and gifts, the wish springs up in his mind of accomplishing all kinds of forbidden acts. By thus perpetrating diverse kinds of sinful acts, he goes to hell. [^1040] That person, O best of men, who, in both happiness and misery, does not fall away from the duties ordained for him, is said to have the scriptures for his eye. It is said that the pleasure one derives from the gratification of one's senses of touch, tongue, sight, scent, and hearing, O monarch, lasts only so long as a shaft urged from the bow takes in falling down upon the earth. Upon the cessation of that pleasure, which is so short-lived, one experiences the most keen agony. It is only the senseless that do not applaud the felicity of Emancipation that is unrivalled. Beholding the misery that attends the gratification of the senses, they that are possessed of wisdom cultivate the virtues of tranquillity and self-restraint for the purpose of attaining to Emancipation. In consequence of their righteous behaviour, wealth, and pleasure can never succeed in afflicting them. [^1041] Householders <span id="p359"><sup><small>[ p. 359 ]</small></sup></span> may, without any compunction, enjoy wealth and other possessions that are obtained without Exertion. As regards, however, the duties of their order that are laid down in the scriptures, these, I am of opinion, they should discharge with the aid of Exertion. [^1042] The practice of those that are honoured, that are born in high families, and that have their eyes always turned towards the import of the scriptures, is incapable of being followed by those that are sinful and that are possessed of unrestrained minds. All acts that are done by man under the influence of vanity, meet with destruction. Hence, for them that are respectable and truly righteous there is no other act in this world to do than penance. [^1043] As regards, those house-holders, however, that are addicted to acts, they should, with their whole hearts, set themselves to acts. Following the duties of their order, O king, they should with cleverness and attention perform sacrifices and other religious rites. Indeed, as all rivers, male and female, have their refuge in the Ocean, even so men belonging to all the other orders have their refuge in the householder.’”

“Janaka said, ‘Whence, O great Rishi, does this difference of colour arise among men belonging to the different orders? I desire to know this. Tell me this, O foremost of speakers! The Srutis say that the offspring one begets are one's own self. Originally sprung from Brahmana, all the inhabitants of the earth should have been Brahmanas. Sprung from Brahmanas, why have men betaken themselves to practices distinguished from those of Brahmanas.’

“Parasara said, ‘It is as thou sayst, O king! The offspring procreated are none else than the procreator himself. In consequence, however, of falling away from penance, this distribution into classes of different colours has <span id="p360"><sup><small>[ p. 360 ]</small></sup></span> taken place. When the soil becomes good and the seed also is good, the offspring produced become meritorious. If, however, the soil and seed become otherwise or inferior, the offspring that will be born will be inferior. They that are conversant with the scriptures know that when the Lord of all creatures set himself to create the worlds, some creatures sprang from his mouth, some from his arms, some from his thighs, and some from his feet. They that thus sprang from his mouth, O child, came to be called Brahmanas. They that sprang from his arms were named Kshatriyas. They, O king, that sprang from his thighs were the wealthy class called the Vaisyas. And, lastly, they that were born of his feet were the serving class, _viz_., the Sudras. Only these four orders of men, O monarch, were thus created. They that belong to classes over and other than these are said to have sprung from an intermixture of these. The Kshatriyas called Atirathas, Amvashthas, Ugras, Vaidehas, Swapakas, Pukkasas, Tenas, Nishadas, Sutas, Magadhas, Ayogas, Karanas, Vratyas, and Chandalas, O monarch, have all sprung from the four original orders by intermixture with one another.’

“Janaka said, ‘When all have sprung from Brahmana alone, how came human beings to have diversity in respect of race? O best of ascetics, an infinite diversity of races is seen in this world. How could men devoted to penances attain, to the status of Brahmanas, though of indiscriminate origin? Indeed, those born of pure wombs and those of impure, all became Brahmanas.’

“Parasara said, ‘O king, the status of high-souled persons that succeeded in cleansing their souls by penances could not be regarded as affected by their low births. Great Rishis, O monarch, by begetting children in indiscriminate wombs, conferred upon them the status of Rishis by means of their power of asceticism. My grandfather Vasishtha, Rishyasringa, Kasyapa, Veda, Tandya, Kripa, Kakshivat, Kamatha, and others, and Yavakrita, O king, and Drona, that foremost of speakers, and Ayu, and Matanga, and Datta, and Drupada, and Matsya, all these, O ruler of the Videhas, obtained their respective positions through penance as the means. Originally only four _Gotras_ (races) arose, O monarch, _viz_., Angiras, Kasyapa, Vasishtha, and Bhrigu. In consequence of acts and behaviour, O ruler of men, many other _Gotras_ came into existence in time. The names of those _Gotras_ have been due to the penances of those that have founded them. Good people use them.’

“Janaka said, ‘Tell me, O holy one, the especial duties of the several orders. Tell me also what their common duties are. Thou art conversant with everything.’

“Parasara said, ‘Acceptance of gifts, officiation at the sacrifices of others, and the teaching of pupils, O king, are the especial duties of the Brahmanas. The protection of the other orders is proper for the Kshatriya. Agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade are the occupations of the Vaisyas. While service of the (three) regenerate classes is the occupation, O king, of the Sudras. I have now told thee what the especial duties are of the four orders, O monarch. Listen now to me, O child, as I tell thee what the common duties are of all the four orders. Compassion, abstention from injury, heedfulness, <span id="p361"><sup><small>[ p. 361 ]</small></sup></span> giving to others what is due to them, Sraddhas in honour of deceased ancestors, hospitality to guests, truthfulness, subjugation of wrath, contentedness with one's own wedded wives, purity (both internal and external), freedom from malice, knowledge of Self, and Renunciation,—these duties, O king, are common to all the orders. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas,—these are the three regenerate orders. All of them have an equal right to the performance of these duties, O foremost of men. These three orders, betaking themselves to duties other than those laid down for them, come to grief, O monarch (and fall down from their own status), even as they go up and acquire great merit by taking for their model some righteous individual of their respective classes who is duly observant of his own duties. The Sudra never falls down (by doing forbidden acts); nor is he worthy of any of the rites of regeneration. The course of duties flowing from the Vedas is not his. He is not interdicted, however, from practising the three and ten duties that are common to all the orders. O ruler of the Videhas, Brahmanas learned in the Vedas, O monarch, regard a (virtuous) Sudra as equal to Brahmana himself. I, however, O king, look upon such a Sudra as the effulgent Vishnu of the universe, the foremost one in all the worlds. [^1044] Persons of the lowest order, desiring to exterminate the evil passions (of lust and wrath, etc.) may betake themselves to the observance of the conduct of the good; and, indeed, while so acting, they may earn great merit by performing all rites that lead to advancement, omitting the _mantras_ that are utterable by the other orders while performing the self-same ceremonies. Wherever persons of the lowest order adopt the behaviour of the good, they succeed in attaining to happiness in consequence of which they are able to pass their time in felicity both here and hereafter.’

“Janaka said, ‘O great ascetic, is man stained by his acts or is he stained by the order or class in which he is born? A doubt has arisen in my mind. It behoveth thee to expound this to me.’

“Parasara said, ‘Without doubt, O king, both, _viz_., acts and birth, are sources of demerit. Listen now to their difference. That man who, though stained by birth, does not commit sin, abstains from sin notwithstanding birth and acts. If, however, a person of superior birth perpetrates censurable acts, such acts stain him. Hence, of the two, _viz_., acts and birth, acts stain man (more than birth). [^1045]

“Janaka said, ‘What are those righteous acts in this world, O best of all regenerate persons, the accomplishment of which does not inflict any injury upon other creatures?’

“Parasara said, ‘Hear from me, O monarch, about what thou askest me’

<span id="p362"><sup><small>[ p. 362 ]</small></sup></span>

_viz_., those acts free from injury which always rescue man. Those who, keeping aside their domestic fires, have dissociated themselves from all worldly attachments, become freed from all anxieties. Gradually ascending step by step, in the path of Yoga, they at last behold the stage of highest felicity (_viz_., Emancipation). [^1046] Endued with faith and humility, always practising self-restraint, possessed of keen intelligence, and abstaining from all acts, they attain to eternal felicity. All classes of men, O king, by properly accomplishing acts that are righteous, by speaking the truth, and by abstaining from unrighteousness, in this world, ascend to heaven. In this there is no doubt.’”


## SECTION CCXCVIII

“Parasara said, ‘The sires, the friends, the preceptor, and the spouses of the preceptors of men that are destitute of devotion are unable to give to those men the merits that attach to devotion. Only they that are firmly devoted to such seniors, that speak what is agreeable to them, that seek their welfare, and that are submissive to them in behaviour, can obtain the merit of devotion. The sire is the highest of deities with his children. It is said that the sire is superior to the mother. The attainment of Knowledge is regarded as the highest acquisition. They that have subjugated the objects of the senses (by attainment of Knowledge), acquire what is highest (_viz_., Emancipation). That Kshatriya prince who, repairing to the field of battle, receives wounds amid fiery shafts flying in all directions and burns therewith, certainly repairs to regions that are unattainable by the very deities and, arrived there, enjoys the felicity of heaven in perfect contentment. A Kshatriya should not, O king, strike one that is fatigued, or one that is frightened, or one that has been disarmed, or one that is weeping, or one that is unwilling to fight, or one that is unequipped with mail and cars and horse and infantry, or one that has ceased to exert oneself in the fight, or one that is ill, or one that cries for quarter, or one that is of tender years, or one that is old. A Kshatriya should, in battle, fight one of his order who is equipped with mail and cars and horse and infantry, who is ready for exertion and who occupies a position of equality. Death at the hands of one that is equal or of a superior is laudable, but not that at the hands of one that is low, or of one that is a coward, or of one that is a wretch. This is well-known. Death at the hands of one that is sinful, or of one that is of low birth and wicked conduct, O king, is inglorious and <span id="p363"><sup><small>[ p. 363 ]</small></sup></span> leads to hell. One whose period of life has run out cannot be rescued by anybody. Similarly, one whose period of life has not been exhausted can never be slain by any one. [^1047] One should prevent one's affectionate seniors from doing unto one (for one's benefit) such acts as are done by menials, as also all such acts as are fraught with injury to others. One should never desire to extend one's own life by taking the lives of others. [^1048] When they lay down their lives, it is laudable for all householders observant of the duties of men living in sacred places to lay down their lives on the banks of sacred streams. [^1049] When one's period of life becomes exhausted, one dissolves away into the five elements. Sometimes this occurs suddenly (through accidents) and sometimes it is brought about by (natural) causes. [^1050] He who, having obtained a body, brings about its dissolution (in a. sacred place by means of some inglorious accident), becomes invested with another body of a similar kind. Though set on the path of the Emancipation, he yet becomes a traveller and attains to another body like a person repairing from one room into another. [^1051] In the matter of such a man's attainment of a second body (notwithstanding his death in a sacred spot) the only cause is his accidental death. There is no second cause. That new body which embodied creatures obtain (in consequence of the accidental character of their deaths in sacred places) comes into existence and becomes attached to Rudras and Pisachas. [^1052] Learned men, conversant with Adhyatma, say that the body is a conglomeration of arteries and sinews and bones and much repulsive and impure matter and a compound of (primal) essences, and the senses and objects of the senses born of desire, all having an outer cover of skin close to them. Destitute (in reality) of beauty and other accomplishments, this conglomeration, through force of the desires of a previous life, assumes a human form. [^1053] Abandoned by the <span id="p364"><sup><small>[ p. 364 ]</small></sup></span> owner, the body becomes inanimate and motionless. Indeed, when the primal ingredients return to their respective natures, the body mingles with the dust. Caused by its union with acts, this body reappears under circumstances determined by its acts. Indeed, O ruler of the Videhas, under whatever circumstances this body meets with dissolution, its next birth, determined by those circumstances, is seen to enjoy and endure the fruits of all its past acts. Jiva, after dissolution of the body it inhabited, does not, O king, take birth in a different body immediately. It roves through the sky for some time like a spacious cloud. Obtaining a new receptacle, O monarch, it then takes birth again. The soul is above the mind. The mind is above the senses. Mobile creatures, again, are foremost of all created objects. Of all mobile creatures those that have two legs are superior. Amongst two-legged creatures, those that are regenerate are superior. Amongst those that are regenerate they that are possessed of wisdom are superior. Amongst them that are possessed of wisdom they that have succeeded in acquiring a knowledge of the soul are superior. Amongst those that are possessed of a knowledge of the soul, they that are endued with humility are superior. Death follows birth in respect of all men. This is settled. Creatures, influenced by the attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, pursue acts which have an end. [^1054] That man is regarded as righteous who meets with dissolution when the Sun is in the northern declension, and at a time and under a constellation both of which are sacred and auspicious. He. is righteous who., having cleansed himself of all sins and accomplished all his acts according to the best of his power and having abstained from giving pain to any man, meets with death when it comes. The death that one meets with by taking poison, by hanging, by burning, at the hands of robbers, and at the teeth of animals, is said to be an inglorious one. [^1055] Those men that are righteous never incur such or similar deaths even if they be afflicted with mental and physical diseases of the most agonising kind. The lives of the righteous, O king, piercing through the Sun, ascend into the regions of Brahma. The lives of those that are both righteous and sinful rove in the middle regions. The lives of those that are sinful sink into the lowest depths. There is only one foe (of man) and not another. That foe is identifiable with ignorance, O king. Overwhelmed by it, one is led to perpetrate acts that are frightful and exceedingly cruel. That foe for resisting which one should put forth one's power by waiting upon the aged according to the duties laid down in the Srutis—that foe which cannot be overcome except by steady endeavours,—meets with destruction., O king, only when it is crushed by the shafts of wisdom. [^1056] The man desirous of achieving merit should at first study the Vedas and observe penances, becoming a Brahmacharin. He should next, entering the <span id="p365"><sup><small>[ p. 365 ]</small></sup></span> domestic mode of life, perform the usual Sacrifices. Establishing his race, he should then enter the forest, restraining his senses, and desirous of winning Emancipation. One should never emasculate oneself by abstaining from any enjoyment. Of all births, the status of humanity is preferable even if one has to become a Chandala. Indeed, O monarch, that order of birth (_viz_., humanity) is the foremost, since by becoming a human being one succeeds in rescuing one's self by meritorious acts. Men always perform righteous acts, O lord, guided by the authority of the Srutis, so that they may not fall away from the status of humanity. That man who, having attained to the status of humanity that is so difficult of attainment, indulges in malice, disregards righteousness and yields himself up to desire, is certainly betrayed by his desires. [^1057] That man who looks upon all creatures with eyes guided by affection, regarding them worthy of being cherished with loving aid, who disregards all kinds of wealth, who offers them consolation, gives them food, address them in agreeable words, and who rejoices in their happiness and grieves in their griefs, has never to suffer misery in the next world, Repairing to the Saraswati, the Naimisha woods, the Pushkara waters, and the other sacred spots on earth, one should make gifts, practise renunciation, render one's aspect amiable, O king, and purify one's body with baths and penances. Those men who meet with death within their houses should have the rites of cremation performed upon their persons. Their bodies should be taken to the crematorium on vehicles and there they should be burnt according to the rites of purification that have been laid down in the scriptures. Religious rites, beneficial ceremonies, the performance of sacrifices, officiation at the sacrifices of others, gifts, the doing of other meritorious acts, the performance, according to the best of one's power, of all that has been ordained in the case of one's deceased ancestors,—all these one does for benefiting one's own self. The Vedas with their six branches, and the other scriptures, O king, have been created for the good of him who is of stainless acts.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘All this was said by that high-souled sage unto the ruler of the Videhas, O king, in days of old for his benefit.’”

## SECTION CCXCIX

“Bhishma said, ‘Once again Janaka, the ruler of Mithila, questioned the high-souled Parasara endued with certain knowledge in respect of all duties.’

“Janaka said, ‘What is productive of good? What is the best path (for living creatures)? What is that which being accomplished is never destroyed? What is that spot repairing whither one has not to come back? Tell me all this, O thou of high intelligence!’

<span id="p366"><sup><small>[ p. 366 ]</small></sup></span>

“Parasara said, ‘Dissociation (from attachments) is the root of what is good. [^1058] Knowledge is the highest path. Penances practised are never destroyed, Gifts also, made to deserving persons, are not lost. When one, breaking the bonds of sin, begins to take pleasure in righteousness, and when one makes that highest of all gifts, _viz_., the pledge of harmlessness unto all creatures, then does one achieve success. He who gives away thousands of kine and hundreds of horses (to deserving persons), and who gives unto all creatures the pledge of harmlessness, receives in return the pledge of harmlessness from all. One may live in the midst of all kinds of wealth and enjoyment, yet, if blessed with intelligence, one does not live in them: while he that is destitute of intelligence lives wholly in objects of enjoyment that are even unsubstantial. [^1059] Sin cannot attach to a man of wisdom even as water cannot drench the leaves of the lotus. Sin adheres more firmly to him who is without attachment even as lac and wood adhere firmly to each other. Sin, which cannot be extinguished except by endurance of its fruits, never abandons the doer. Verily, the doer, when the time comes, has to endure the consequences arising from it. [^1060] They, however, that are of cleansed souls and that realise the existence of Brahma, are never afflicted by the fruits of their acts. Heedless in respect of one's senses of knowledge and of action, one that is not conscious of one's wicked acts, and whose heart is attached to both good and bad, becomes afflicted with great fear. One who at all times becomes entirely freed from attachments and who completely subjugates the passion of wrath, is never stained by sin even if he lives in the enjoyment of worldly objects. As a dyke built across a river, if not washed away, causes the waters thereof to swell up, even so the man who, without being attached to objects of enjoyments, creates the dyke of righteousness whose materials consist of the limitations set down in the scriptures, has never to languish. On the other hand, his merits and penances increase. As the pure gem (called Suryakanta) absorbs and attracts to itself, the rays of the Sun, even so, O tiger among kings, does Yoga proceed by help of concentrated attention. [^1061] As sesame seeds, in consequence of their repeated intermingling with (fragrant) flowers, become in respect of quality very agreeable, even so the quality of Sattwa arises in men in proportion to the measure of their association with persons of cleansed souls. [^1062] When one becomes desirous of dwelling in heaven, one <span id="p367"><sup><small>[ p. 367 ]</small></sup></span> casts off one's spouses and wealth and rank and vehicles and diverse kinds of good acts. Indeed, when one attains to such a frame of mind, one's understanding is said to be dissociated from the objects of the senses. That man (on the other hand) who, with understanding attached to the objects of the senses, becomes blind to what is for his real good, is dragged (to his ruin) by his heart which runs after all worldly objects, like a fish (dragged to its ruin) by the bait of meat. Like unto the body that is made up of different limbs and organs, all mortal creatures exist depending upon one another. They are as destitute of vigour as the pith of the banana plant. (Left to themselves) they sink in the world's ocean like a boat (made of weak materials). There is no fixed time for the acquisition of righteousness. Death waits for no man. When man is constantly running towards the jaws of Death, the accomplishment of righteous acts is proper at all times. Like a blind man who, with attention, is capable of moving about his own house, the man of wisdom, with mind set on Yoga, succeeds in proceeding along the track (he should follow). [^1063] It has been said that death arises in consequence of birth. Birth is subject to the sway of death. One unacquainted with the course of the duties of Emancipation revolves like a wheel between birth and death, unable to free oneself from that fate. One who walketh along the track recommended by the understanding earns happiness both here and hereafter. The Diverse are fraught with misery, while the Few are productive of happiness. Fruits represented by the not-Soul are said to constitute the Diverse. Renunciation is (said to constitute the Few and that is) productive of the soul's happiness. [^1064] As the lotus stalk quickly leaves the mire attached to it, even so the Soul can speedily cast off the mind. [^1065] It is the mind that at first inclines the Soul to Yoga. The latter then merges the former into itself. When the Soul achieves success in Yoga, it then beholds itself uninvested with attributes. [^1066] Engaged amid the objects of the senses, one who regards such engagement to be one's employment falleth away from one's true employment in consequence of such devotion to those objects. The soul of the wise man attains, through its <span id="p368"><sup><small>[ p. 368 ]</small></sup></span> righteous acts, to a state of high felicity in heaven, while that of the man who is not possessed of wisdom sinks very low or obtains birth among intermediate creatures. As a liquid substance, if kept in a baked earthen vessel, does not escape therefrom but remains undiminished, after the same manner one's body with which one has undergone austerities enjoys (without rejecting) all objects of enjoyment (up to what are contained in the region of Brahma himself). Verily, that man who enjoys worldly objects can never be emancipated. That man, on the other hand, who casts off such objects (in this world), succeeds in enjoying great happiness hereafter. Like one afflicted with congenital blindness and, therefore, incapable of seeing his way, the sensualist, with soul confined in an opaque case, seems to be surrounded by a mist and fails to see (the true object for which he should strive). As merchants, going across the sea, make profits proportioned to their capital, even so creatures, in this world of mortals, attain to ends according to their respective acts. Like a snake devouring air, Death wanders in this world made up of days and nights in the form of Decrepitude and devours all creatures. A creature, when born, enjoys or endures the fruits of acts done by him in his previous lives. There is nothing agreeable or disagreeable which one enjoys or endures without its being the result of the acts one has done in one's previous lives. Whether lying or proceeding, whether sitting idly engaged in his occupations, in whatever state a man may be, his acts (of past lives) good or bad always approach him. One that has attained to the other shore of the ocean, wishes not to cross the main for returning to the shore whence he had sailed. [^1067] As the fisherman, when he wishes, raises with the help of his chord his boat sunk in the waters (of a river or lake), after the same manner the mind, by the aid of Yoga-contemplation, raises Jiva sunk in the world's ocean and unemancipated from consciousness of body. [^1068] As all rivers running towards the ocean, unite themselves with it, even so the mind, when engaged in Yoga, becomes united with primal Prakriti. [^1069] Men whose minds become bound by diverse chains of affection, and who are engulfed in ignorance, meet with destruction like houses of sand in water. [^1070] That embodied creature who regards his body as only a house and purity (both external and internal) as its sacred water, and who walks along the path of the understanding, succeeds <span id="p369"><sup><small>[ p. 369 ]</small></sup></span> in attaining to happiness both here and hereafter. [^1071] The Diverse are productive of misery; while the Few are productive of happiness. The Diverse are the fruits represented by the not-Soul. Renunciation (which is identical with Few) is productive of the soul's benefit. [^1072] One's friends who spring up from one's determination, and one's kinsmen whose attachment is due to (selfish) reasons, one's spouses and sons and servants, only devour one's wealth. Neither the mother, nor the father, can confer the slightest benefit upon one in the next world. Gifts constitute the diet upon which one can subsist. Indeed, one must have to enjoy the fruits of one's own acts. [^1073] The mother, the son, the sire, the brother, the wife, and friends, are like lines traced with gold by the side of gold itself. [^1074] All acts, good and bad, done in past lives come to the doer. Knowing that everything one enjoys or endures at present is the result of the acts of past lives, the soul urges the understanding on different directions (so that it may act in such a way as to avoid all unpleasant fruits). Relying on earnest endeavour, and equipped with proper aids, he who sets himself to accomplish his tasks never meets with failure. As the rays of light never abandon the Sun, even so prosperity never abandons one who is endued with undoubting faith. That act which a man of stainless soul does with faith and earnestness, with the aid of proper means, without pride, and with intelligence, becomes never lost. A creature obtains from the very time of his abode in the mother's womb all his own acts good and bad that were achieved by him in his past lives. Death, which is irresistible, aided by Time which brings about the destruction of life, leads all creatures to their end like wind scattering the dust of sawed timber. [^1075] Through acts good and bad performed by himself in his past lives, man obtains gold and animals and spouses, and children, and honour of birth, and possessions of value, and his entire affluence.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus addressed conformably to the truth by the <span id="p370"><sup><small>[ p. 370 ]</small></sup></span> sage, Janaka, that foremost of righteous persons, O king, heard everything the Rishi said and obtained great happiness from it.’”

## SECTION CCC

“Yudhishthira said, ‘O grandsire, learned men praise truth, self-restraint, forgiveness, and wisdom. What is thy opinion of these virtues?’

“Bhishma said, ‘In this connection I shall recite to thee an old narrative, O Yudhishthira, of the discourse between the Sadhyas and a Swan. Once on a time the Unborn and eternal Lord of all creatures (_viz_., Brahman), assuming the form of a golden Swan, wandered through the three worlds till in course of his wanderings he came upon the Sadhyas.’

“The Sadhyas said, ‘O ford, we are the deities called Sadhyas. We like to question thee. Indeed, we would ask thee about the religion of Emancipation. Thou art well-acquainted with it. We have heard, O bird, that thou art possessed of great learning, and eloquent and wise of speech. O bird, what dost thou think is the highest of all objects? O high-souled one, in what does thy mind find pleasure? Do thou, therefore, O foremost of birds, instruct us as to what that one act is which thou regardest as the foremost of all acts, and by doing which, O chief of the feathery creation, one may soon be freed from all bonds.’

“The Swan said, ‘Ye who have drunk Amrita, I have heard that one should have recourse to these, _viz_., penances, self-restraint, truth, and subjugation of the mind. Untying all the knots of the heart, one should also bring under one's control both what is agreeable and what is disagreeable. [^1076] One should not wound the vitals of others. One should not be an utterer of cruel speeches. One should never take scriptural lectures from a person that is mean. One should never utter such words as inflict pain on others, as cause others to burn (with misery), and as lead to hell. Wordy shafts fall from the lips. Pierced therewith one (to whom they are directed) burns incessantly. Those shafts do not strike any part other than the very vitals of the person aimed. Hence he that is possessed of learning should never aim them at others. If a person deeply pierces a man of wisdom with wordy shafts, the wise mart should then adopt peace (without giving way to wrath). The man who, though sought to be angered, rejoices without yielding to anger, taketh away from the provoker all his merits. That man of righteous soul, who, full of joy and freed from malice, subdues his blazing wrath which, if indulged, would lead him to speak ill of others and verily <span id="p371"><sup><small>[ p. 371 ]</small></sup></span> become his foe, takes away the merits of others. As regards myself, I never answer I when another speaks ill of me. If assailed, I always forgive the assault. The righteous are of opinion that forgiveness and truth and sincerity and compassion are the foremost (of all virtues). Truth is the arcanum of the Vedas. The arcanum of Truth is self-restraint. The arcanum of self-restraint is Emancipation. This is the teaching of all the scriptures. I regard that person to be Brahmana and Muni who subjugates the rising impulse of speech, the impulse of wrath appearing in the mind, the impulse of thirst (after unworthy things), and the impulses of the stomach and the organ of pleasure. One who does not yield to wrath is superior to one who does. One who practises renunciation is superior to one who does not. One who possesses the virtues of manhood is superior to one who has them not. One who is endued with knowledge is superior to one who is destitute of it. Assailed with harsh speeches one should not assail in return. Indeed, one who, under such circumstances, renounces wrath, succeeds in burning the assailant and taking away all his merits. [^1077] That person who when assailed with harsh speeches does not utter a harsh word in reply, who when praised does not utter what is agreeable to him that praises, who is endued with such fortitude as not to strike in return when struck and not to even wish evil to the striker, finds his companionship always coveted by the gods. He that is sinful should be forgiven as if he were righteous, by one that is insulted, struck, and calumniated. By acting in this way one attains to success. Though all my objects have been fulfilled, yet I always wait reverentially on those that are righteous. I have no thirst. My wrath hath been suppressed. Seduced by covetousness I do not fall away from the path of righteousness. I do not also approach any one (with solicitations) for wealth. [^1078] If cursed, I do not curse in return. I know that self-restraint is the door of immortality. I disclose unto you a great mystery. There is no status that is superior to that of humanity. Freed from sin like the Moon from murky clouds, the man of wisdom, shining in resplendence, attains to success by patiently waiting for his time. A person of restrained soul, who becomes the object of adoration with all by becoming the foremost of the supporting pillars of the universe, and towards whom only agreeable words are spoken by all, attains to the companionship of the deities. Revilers never come forward to speak of the merits of a person as they speak of his demerits. That person whose speech and mind are properly restrained and always devoted to the Supreme, succeeds in attaining to the fruits of the Vedas, Penances, and Renunciation. The man of wisdom should never revile (in return) those that are destitute of merit, by uttering their dispraise and by insults. He should not extol others (being extolled by them) and should never injure themselves. The man endued with wisdom and learning regards revilement as nectar. Reviled, he sleeps without anxiety. The reviler, on the other hand, meets with destruction. The sacrifices that one performs in <span id="p372"><sup><small>[ p. 372 ]</small></sup></span> anger, the gifts one makes in anger, the penances one undergoes in anger, and the offerings and libations one makes to the sacred fire in anger, are such that their merits are robbed by Yama. The toil of an angry man becomes entirely fruitless. Ye foremost of immortals, that person is said to be conversant with righteousness whose four doors, _viz_., the organ of pleasure, the stomach, the two arms, and speech, are well-restrained. That person who, always practising truth and self-restraint and sincerity and compassion and patience and renunciation, becomes devoted to the study of the Vedas, does not covet what belongs to others, and pursues what is good with a singleness of purpose, succeeds in attaining to heaven. Like a calf sucking all the four teats of its dam's udders, one should devote oneself to the practice of all these virtues. I do not know whether anything exists that is more sacred than Truth. Having roved among both human beings and the deities, I declare it that Truth is the only means for reaching heaven even as a ship is the only means for crossing the ocean. A person becomes like those with whom he dwells, and like those whom he reverences, and like to what he wishes to be. If a person waits with reverence on him who is good or him who is otherwise, if he waits with reverence on a sage possessed of ascetic merit or on a thief, passes under his way and catches his hue like a piece of cloth catching the dye in which it is steeped. The deities always converse with those that are possessed of wisdom and goodness. They, therefore, never entertain the wish for even seeing the enjoyments in which men take pleasure. The person who knows that all objects of enjoyment (which human beings cherish) are characterised by vicissitudes, has few rivals, and is superior to the very Moon and the Wind. [^1079] When the Purusha that dwells in one's heart is unstained, and walks in the path of the righteous, the gods take a pleasure in him. The gods from a distance cast off those that are always devoted to the gratification of their organs of pleasure and the stomach, that are addicted to thieving, and that always indulge in harsh speeches, even if they expiate their offences by performing the proper rites. The gods are never pleased with one of mean soul, with one who observes no restrictions in the matter of food, and with one who is of sinful deeds. On the other hand, the gods associate with those men that are observant of the vow of truth, that are grateful, and that are engaged in the practice of righteousness. Silence is better than speech. To speak the truth is better than silence. Again to speak truth that is connected with righteousness is better than to speak the truth. To speak that which, besides being true and righteous, is agreeable, is better than to speak truth connected with righteousness.’

“The Sadhyas said, ‘By what is this world covered? For what reason does <span id="p373"><sup><small>[ p. 373 ]</small></sup></span> one fail to shine? For what cause do people cast off their friends? For what reason do people fail to attain to heaven?’

“The Swan said, ‘The world is enveloped by (the darkness of) Ignorance. Men fail to shine in consequence of malice. People cast off friends, induced by covetousness. Men fail to attain to heaven in consequence of attachment.’

“The Sadhyas said, ‘Who alone among the Brahmanas is always happy? Who alone amongst them can observe the vow of silence though dwelling in the midst of many? Who alone amongst them, though weak, is still regarded as strong? And who alone amongst them does not quarrel?’

“The Swan said, ‘He alone amongst the Brahmanas that is possessed of wisdom is always happy. He alone amongst the Brahmanas that is possessed of wisdom succeeds in observing the vow of silence, though dwelling in the midst of many. He alone amongst the Brahmanas who is possessed of wisdom, though actually weak, is regarded as strong. He alone amongst them that has wisdom succeeds in avoiding quarrel.’ [^1080]

“The Sadhyas said, ‘in what consists the divinity of the Brahmanas? In what their purity? In what their impurity? And in what their status of humanity?’

“The Swan said, ‘In the study of the Vedas is the divinity of the Brahmanas. In their vows and observances is their purity. In obloquy is their impurity. In death is their humanity.’ [^1081]

“Bhishma continued, ‘Thus have I recited to thee excellent narrative of the discourse between the Sadhyas (and the Swan). The body (both gross and subtile) is the origin of acts, and existence or Jiva is truth.’


## SECTION CCCI

“Yudhishthira said, ‘It behoveth thee to explain to me, O sire, what the difference is between the Sankhya and the Yoga system of philosophy. O foremost one of Kuru's race, everything is known to thee, O thou that art conversant with all duties!’

“Bhishma said, ‘The followers of Sankhya praise the Sankhya system and those regenerate persons that are Yogins praise the Yoga system. For establishing the superiority of their respective systems, each calls his own system to be the better. Men of wisdom devoted to Yoga assign proper and very good reasons, O crusher of foes, for showing that one that does not believe in the existence of God cannot attain to Emancipation. Those regenerate <span id="p374"><sup><small>[ p. 374 ]</small></sup></span> persons, again, that are believers in the Sankhya doctrines advance good reasons for showing that one, by acquiring true knowledge of all ends, becomes dissociated from all worldly objects, and, after departing from this body, it is plain, becomes emancipated and that it cannot be otherwise. Men of great wisdom have thus expounded the Sankhya philosophy of Emancipation. When reasons are thus balanced on both sides, those that are assigned on that side which one is otherwise inclined to adopt as one's own, should be accepted. Indeed, those words that are said on that side should be regarded as beneficial. Good men may be found on both sides. Persons like thee may adopt either opinion. The evidences of Yoga are addressed to the direct ken of the senses; those of Sankhya are based on the scriptures. Both systems of philosophy are approved by me, O Yudhishthira. Both those systems of science, O king, have my concurrence and are concurred in by those that are good and wise. If practised duly according to the instructions laid down, both would, O king, cause a person to attain to the highest end. In both systems purity is equally recommended as also compassion towards all creatures, O sinless one. In both, again, the observance of vows has been equally laid down. Only the scriptures that point out their paths are different.’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘If the vows, the purity, the compassion, and the fruits thereof recommended in both systems be the same, tell me, O grandsire, for what reason then are not their scriptures (in respect of the paths recommended) the same?’

“Bhishma said, ‘By casting off, through the aid of Yoga, these five faults, _viz_., attachment, heedlessness, affection, lust, and wrath, one attains to Emancipation. As large fishes, breaking through the pet, pass into their own element (for ranging in felicity), after the same manner, Yogins (breaking through lust and wrath, etc.) become cleansed of all sins and attain to the felicity of Emancipation. As powerful animals, breaking through the nets in which hunters enmesh them, escape into the felicity of freedom, after the same manner, Yogins, freed from all bonds, attain to the sinless path that leads to Emancipation. Truly, O king, breaking through the bonds born of cupidity, Yogins, endued with strength, attain to the sinless and auspicious and high path of Emancipation. Feeble animals, O monarch, entangled in nets, are without doubt, destroyed. Even such is the case with persons destitute of the puissance of Yoga. As weak fishes, O son of Kunti, fallen into the net, become entangled in it, even so, O monarch, men destitute of the puissance of Yoga, encounter destruction (amid the bonds of the world). As birds, O chastiser of foes, when entangled in the fine nets of fowlers (if weak) meet with their ruin but if endued with strength effect their escape, after the same manner does it happen with Yogins, O chastiser of foes. Bound by the bonds of action, they that are weak meet with destruction, while they that are possessed of strength break through them. A small and weak fire, O king, becomes extinguished when large logs of timber are placed upon it. Even so the Yogin that is weak, O king, meets with ruin (when brought in contact with the world and its attachments). The same fire, however, O monarch, when it becomes strong, would (without being extinguished) burn with the aid of the <span id="p375"><sup><small>[ p. 375 ]</small></sup></span> wind, the whole Earth. After the same manner, the Yogin, when grown in strength, burning with energy, and possessed of might, is capable of scorching the entire Universe like the Sun that rises at the time of 'the universal dissolution. As a weak man, O king, is swept away by a current, even so is a weak Yogin helplessly carried away by objects of the senses. An elephant withstands a mighty current. After the same manner, a Yogin, having acquired Yoga-puissance, withstands all objects of the senses. Independent of all things, Yogins, endued with Yoga-puissance and invested with lordship, enter into (the hearts of) the very lords of creation, the _Rishis_, the deities, and the great Beings in the universe. Neither Yama, nor the Destroyer, nor Death himself of terrible prowess, when angry, ever succeeds in prevailing over the Yogin, O king, who is possessed of immeasurable energy. The Yogin, acquiring Yoga-puissance, can create thousands of bodies and with them wander over the earth. Some amongst them enjoy objects of the senses and then once more set themselves to the practice of the austerest penances, and once again, like the Sun (withdrawing his rays), withdraw themselves from such penances. [^1082] The Yogin, who is possessed of strength and whom bonds bind not, certainly succeeds in attaining to Emancipation. I have now discoursed to thee, O monarch, on all these powers of Yoga. I shall once more tell thee what the subtile powers of Yoga are with their indications. Rear, O chief of Bharata's race, the subtile indications of the _Dharana_ and the _Samadhi_ of the Soul (such as Yoga brings about). [^1083] As a bowman who is heedful and attentive succeeds in striking the aim, even so the Yogin. with absorbed soul, without doubt, attains to Emancipation. As a man fixing his mind on a vessel full of some liquid (placed on his head) heedfully ascends a flight of steps, even so the Yogin, fixed and absorbed in his soul, cleanses it and makes it as effulgent as the Sun. As a boat, O son of Kunti, that is tossed on the bosom of the sea is very soon taken by a heedful boatman to the other shore, even so the man of knowledge by fixing his soul in _Samadhi_, attains to Emancipation, which is so difficult to acquire, after casting off his body, O monarch. As a heedful charioteer, O king, having yoked good steeds (unto his car) takes the car-warrior to the spot he wishes, even so the Yogin, O monarch, heedful in _Dharana_, soon attains to the highest spot (_viz_., Emancipation) like a shaft let off from the bow reaching the object aimed at. The Yogin who stays immovably after having entered his self into the soul, destroys his sins and obtains that indestructible spot which is the possession of those that are righteous. That Yogin who, heedfully observant of high vows, properly unites O king, his Jiva-soul with the subtile Soul in the navel, the throat, the head, the heart, the chest, the sides, the eye, the ear, and the nose, burns all his acts good and bad of even mountain-like proportions, and having recourse to excellent Yoga, attains to Emancipation.’

“Yudhishthira said, ‘It behoveth thee to tell me, O grandsire, what the kinds <span id="p376"><sup><small>[ p. 376 ]</small></sup></span> of diet are by taking which, and what the things are by conquering which, the Yogin, O Bharata, acquires Yoga-puissance.’

“Bhishma continued, ‘Engaged, O Bharata, in subsisting upon broken grains of rice and sodden cakes of sesame, and abstaining from oil and butter, the Yogin acquires Yoga-puissance. By subsisting for a long time on powdered barley unmixed with any liquid substance, and by confining himself to only one meal a day, the Yogin, of cleansed soul, acquires Yoga-puissance. By drinking only water mixed with milk, first only once during the day, then once during a fortnight, then once during a month, then once during three months, and then once during a whole year, the Yogin acquires Yoga-puissance. By abstaining entirely from meat, O king, the Yogin of cleansed soul acquires puissance. [^1084] By subjugating lust, and wrath, and heat, and cold and rain, and fear, and grief, and the breath, and all sounds that are agreeable to men, and objects of the senses, and the uneasiness, so difficult to conquer, that is born of abstention from sexual congress, and thirst that is so terrible, O king, and the pleasures of touch, and sleep, and procrastination that is almost unconquerable, O best of kings, high-souled Yogins, divested of attachments, and possessed of great wisdom, aided by their understandings, and equipped with wealth of contemplation and study, cause the subtile soul to stand confessed in all its glory. This high (Yoga) path of learned Brahmanas is exceedingly difficult to tread. No one can walk along this path with ease. That path is like a terrible forest which abounds with innumerable snakes and crawling vermin, with (concealed) pits occurring every where, without water for slaking one's thirst, and full of thorns, and inaccessible on that account. Indeed, the path of Yoga is like a road along which no edibles occur, which runs through a desert having all its trees burnt down in a conflagration, and which has been rendered unsafe by being infested with bands of robbers. Very few young men can pass safely through it (for reaching the goal). Like unto a path of this nature, few Brahmanas can tread alone the Yoga-path with ease and comfort. That man who, having betaken himself to this path, ceases to go forward (but turns back after having made some progress), is regarded as guilty of many faults. Men of cleansed souls, O lord of Earth, can stay with ease upon Yoga-contemplation which is like the sharp edge of a razor. Persons of uncleansed souls, however, cannot stay on it. When Yoga-contemplation becomes disturbed or otherwise obstructed, it can never lead the Yogin to an auspicious end even as a vessel that is without a captain cannot take the passengers to the other shore. That man, O son of Kunti, who practises Yoga-contemplation according to due rites, succeeds in casting off both birth and death, and happiness and sorrow. All this that I have told thee has been stated in the diverse treatises bearing upon Yoga. The highest fruits of Yoga are seen in persons of the regenerate order. That highest fruit <span id="p377"><sup><small>[ p. 377 ]</small></sup></span> is identification with Brahma. The high-souled Yogin, possessed of greatness, can enter into and come out of, at his will, Brahma himself who is the lord of all deities, and the boon-giving Vishnu, and Bhava, and Dharma, and the six-faced Kartikeya, and the (spiritual) sons of Brahmana, the quality of Darkness that is productive of much pain, and that of Passion, and that of Sattwa which is pure, and Prakriti which is the highest, and the goddess Siddhi who is the spouse of Varuna, and all kinds of energy, and all enduring patience, and the bright lord of stars in the firmament with the stars twinkling all around, and the Viswas. and the (great) snakes, and the Pitris, and all the mountains and hills, and the great and terrible oceans, and all the rivers, and the rain-charged clouds, and serpents, and trees, and Yakshas, and the cardinal and subsidiary points of the compass, and the Gandharvas, and all male persons and all female ones also. This discourse, O king, that is connected with the Supreme Being of mighty energy should be regarded as auspicious. The Yogin has Narayana for his soul. Prevailing over all things (through his contemplation of the Supreme deity), the high-souled Yogin is capable of creating all things.’”

## Footnotes


[^0]: 1:1 It is very difficult to literally translate such verses. The word _Dharma_ is sometimes used in the sense of Religion or the aggregate of duties. At other times it simply means a duty or the course of duties prescribed for a particular situation. _Tapah_ is generally rendered penance. Here, however, it has a direct reference to _sravana_ (hearing), _manana_ (contemplation), and _nididhyasana_ (abstraction of the soul from everything else for absolute concentration). The Grammar of the second half of the first line is _Sati apretya_ etc., _Sat_ being that which is real, hence, the Soul, or the Supreme Soul, of which every individual Soul is only a portion.

[^1]: 2:1 And not the Soul, as the commentator explains. With the death of the body joy and grief disappear.

[^2]: 2:2 The art by which the body could, as in Egypt, be preserved for thousands of years was not known to the _Rishis_.

[^3]: 3:1 The commentator explains the sense of this as follows; The cow belongs to him who drinks her milk. Those who derive no advantage from her have no need for showing her any affection. One should not covet what is above one's want, It has been said, that (to a thirsty or hungry or toil-worn man), a little quantity of vaccine milk is of more use than a hundred kine; a small measure of rice more useful than a hundred barns filled with grain; half a little bed is of more use than a large mansion.

[^4]: 3:2 I follow Nilakantha in rendering this verse. His interpretation is plausible. _Mudatamah_, according to him, are those who are in deep sleep. There are four stages of consciousness. These are (1) wakefulness, (2) dream, (3) dreamless or deep slumber, and (4) Turiya or absolute Samadhi (which the Yogin only can attain to).

[^5]: 3:3 The two extremes, of course, are dreamless slumber and _Turiya_ or _Samadhi_. The two intermediate ones are wakefulness and sleep with dream.

[^6]: 3:4 _Pride_ in consequences of having insulted or humiliated others; and success over others such as victories in, battle and other concerns of the world.

[^7]: 4:1 The first half of the second line is read variously. The sense, however, in effect, remains unaltered. What is said here is that man who succeeds in attaining to a state of Brahma by true Samadhi or abstraction from the world, can never be touched by grief.

[^8]: 4:2 In all treatises on Yoga it is said that when the first stage is passed, the neophyte succeeds in looking at his own self. The meaning seems to be that he experiences a sort of double existence so that he succeeds in himself looking at his own self.

[^9]: 4:3 This is the same as 46. The Bombay edition does not repeat it.

[^10]: 5:1 The house referred to is the body. The single column on which it is supported is the backbone, and the nine doors are the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, etc. etc.

[^11]: 5:2 The sense is that women always regard their human lovers as dear without regarding the Supreme Being to be so, although He is always with them.

[^12]: 5:3 _i.e._, coursing on, without waiting for any one.

[^13]: 5:4 Literally, intelligent.

[^14]: 6:1 The true reading is _Jnanena_ and not _ajnanena_. Then, in the last foot, the word is _a-pihitah_ and not _apihitah_. The words with _ava_ and _api_ frequently drop the initial _a_, Hence _a-pihitah_ means _not_ covered.

[^15]: 7:1 The word used in the text is _Devanam_ (of the gods). There can be no doubt however, that the word _deva_ is here used for implying the senses.

[^16]: 7:2 _i.e._, wild beasts and lawless men.

[^17]: 7:3 _Asatyajyam_ and _Asatyadyam_ are both correct. The sense is the same. The first means ‘having untruth for the libation (that it eats up).’ The second means ‘having untruth for the food (it devours)’.

[^18]: 7:4 _Santi_ is tranquillity. The _Santi_\-sacrifice is the endeavour to practise self-denial in everything; in other words, to restrain all sorts of propensities or inclinations. The _Brahma_\-sacrifice is reflection on truths laid down in the _Upanishads_. The Word-sacrifice consists in the silent recitation (_japa_) of the _Pranava_ or Om, the initial mantra. The Mind-sacrifice is contemplation of the Supreme Soul. The Work-sacrifice consists in baths, cleanliness, and waiting upon the preceptor.

[^19]: 7:5 Both readings are correct, _viz_., _Kshetrayajna_ and _Kshetrayajna_. _Kshetra_ is, of course, the body. If the latter reading be accepted, the meaning will be ‘a sacrifice like that of a _Kshatriya_, _i.e._, battle.’ Hence, all kinds of acts involving cruelty.

[^20]: 8:1 or, seek _Brahma_ in thy understanding. The word _Atman_ is often synonymous with Supreme Self.

[^21]: 8:2 The commentator explains that the object of Yudhishthira's question is this: in the preceding section or lesson it has been inculcated that one may seek the acquisition of the religion of _moksha_ or emancipation even when he is young. Yudhishthira enquires whether wealth (so necessary for the performance of sacrifices) is needed for the acquisition of that religion. If wealth be necessary, the poor then would not be able to acquire that religion. Hence the enquiry about the way in which joy and sorrow come to the wealthy and to the poor.

[^22]: 8:3 The verses are said to be old. Nilakantha accordingly supposes that it was not Sampaka who recited them to Bhishma, but some one else. I follow the commentator; but the grammar of the concluding verse of this section must have to be twisted for supporting him.

[^23]: 10:1 _Kakataliyam_ is, literally, ‘after the manner of the crow and the palmyra fruit.’ The story is that once when a crow perched upon a palmyra tree a fruit (which had been ripe) fell down. The fruit fell because of its ripeness. It would be a mistake to accept the sitting of the crow as the cause of the fall. The perching was only an accident. Yet men very frequently, in tracing causes, accept accidents for inducing causes. Such men are said to be deceived by ‘the fallacy of the crow and the palmyra fruit.’

[^24]: 11:1 Exertion to be successful must depend on circumstances. The combination of circumstances is destiny.

[^25]: 11:2 It is difficult to resist the belief that many of the passages of the _Santi_ are later additions. Suka was the son of Vyasa. To quote a saying of Suka (or, as he was called Sukadeva Goswamin), if Vyasa was the real writer of this passage, is rather suspicious.

[^26]: 11:3 _i.e._, arrive at such a point that nothing was left for him to desire.

[^27]: 11:4 _i.e._, with, the view of doing thee good, I shall emancipate myself from all attachments and enjoy the blessedness of tranquillity.

[^28]: 11:5 Here the theory of desire seems to be reversed. Desire is mere wish after anything. When its gratification is sought, the form it assumes is that of determination or will. If, however, _Kama_ be taken as the formulated desire after specific objects, then, perhaps, the Will may be regarded as its foundation, at least, in respect of the distress and difficulties that come in its train.

[^29]: 12:1 I think the Bombay reading of this verse is incorrect. _Bhuttagramah_ (nom. sing.) should be _Bhutagramam_ (accusative sing.). The _Yah_ is _Kamah_. It is Desire that is exhorted to go away whithersoever it chooses. If the elements be thus exhorted, then it is death that the speaker desires. This would be inconsistent with the spirit of the passage.

[^30]: 12:2 The use of the plural _Yushmashu_ might lead at first sight to take it as standing for the elements. It is plain, however, that it refers to all attributes that are founded on _Rajas_ and _Tamas_.

[^31]: 12:3 Beholding all creatures in my own body and mind _i.e._, identifying myself with all creatures or never taking them as distinct and separated from me: in other words, professing and practising the principle of universal love.

[^32]: 12:4 The two lines are antithetical. What is said here is that though there is misery in property, there is no real happiness in affluence. Hence Nilakantha is right in supposing that the last word of the first line is not _dhane_ but _adhane_ the _Sandhi_ being Arsha.

[^33]: 14:1 Nilakantha explains that by _Saranga_ here is meant the bee. The _anweshanam_ following it is ‘going behind.’ The whole compound means ‘imitation of the bee in the forest.’

[^34]: 14:2 The allusion is to the story of Pingala, in Section 74 _ante_.

[^35]: 14:3 The story, evidently a very ancient one, is given in full in the _Bhagavat_. Once on a time, a maiden, residing in her father's house, wished to feed secretly a number of Brahmanas. While removing the grain from the barn, her anklets, made of shells, began to jingle. Fearing discovery through that noise, she broke all her anklets except one for each hand.

[^36]: 15:1 _Animittatah_ is explained by Nilakantha as one that has no cause, _i.e._, _Brahma_. The commentator would take this speech as a theistic one. I refuse to reject the plain and obvious meaning of the word, All phases of speculative opinion are discussed in the Santi. It is very Possible that a religious indifferentism is preached here.

[^37]: 15:2 The sense of the passage is that as everything depends upon its own nature, it cannot, by its action, either gladden or grieve me. If a son be born to me I am not delighted. If he dies, I am not grieved. His birth and death depend upon his own nature as a mortal. I have no Power to alter that nature or affect it in any way.

[^38]: 16:1 The word _Ajagara_ implies ‘after the manner of a big snake that cannot move.’ it is believed that such snakes, without moving, lie in the same place in expectation of prey, eating when anything comes near famishing when there is nothing.

[^39]: 18:1 The meaning is that even copious drafts do not slake thirst permanently, for after being slaked, it is sure to return.

[^40]: 19:1 In the Bengal texts, 44 is made a triplet. The correct reading, however, is to take 44 as a couplet and 45 as a triplet. Nilakantha points out that _Icchantaste_, etc., is grammatically connected with 45.

[^41]: 20:1 The auspicious constellations are such as Pushya and others; the inauspicious are Mula Aslesha, Magha, etc; _yajnaprasava_ may also mean the _fruits_ of sacrifices.

[^42]: 20:2 _Anwikshikim_ may also mean ‘microscopic’.

[^43]: 20:3 The word _dattam_, generally rendered ‘gifts’ or ‘charity,’ means and includes protection of suppliants, abstention from injury as regards all creatures, and actual gifts made outside the sacrificial altar. Similarly, the maintenance of the sacred fire, penances, purity of conduct, the study of the Vedas, hospitality to guests, and offer of food to the Viswedevas, are all included in the word _Ishta_ which is ordinarily rendered ‘sacrifice.’

[^44]: 21:1 _i.e._, even if he seeks to avoid it.

[^45]: 21:2 _i.e._, becomes his inseparable associate.

[^46]: 21:3 What is meant is that if once the consequences of the acts of a past life are exhausted, the creature (with respect to whom such exhaustion takes place), is freed from all vicissitudes of life. Lest, however, such creatures become emancipated, the orthodox view is that a balance is always left of both merit and demerit, so that a new birth must take place and the consequences of what is thus left as a balance must begin to be enjoyed or suffered. This is not referred to here, but this is the view of all orthodox Hindus.

[^47]: 21:4 The first word of this verse is diversely read. The reading I adopt is _samunnam_ meaning drenched in water. If it be _samjuktam_ it would mean united, with filth, of course. Another reading is _samswinnam_, meaning ‘drenched with sweat.’ Nilakantha explains _upavasah_ here as equivalent to the renunciation of all earthly possessions. Ordinarily it means ‘fasts.’

[^48]: 22:1 This verse occurs in the _Santi Parva_. It is difficult to understand in what sense it is said that the track of the virtuous cannot be marked. Perhaps, it is; intended that such men do not leave any history or record behind them, they having abstained from all kinds of action good or bad.

[^49]: 22:2 _Manasa_ means ‘appertaining to the mind,’ or rather, the Will. _Mahat_ literally means great.

[^50]: 23:1 Veda is here used in the sense of Knowledge and Power.

[^51]: 23:2 _Sarvabhutatmakrit_ is explained by Nilakantha thus. He who is _Sarvabhutatman_ is again _bhutakrit_. On the authority of the _Srutis_ the commentator adds,—ye ete pancha akasadayodhatavo-dharana-karmanah sa eva Brahma.

[^52]: 23:3 The word _Devah_ here is evidently used in the sense of luminous or shining ones and not in that of gods or deities.

[^53]: 25:1 The _Rishis_ supposed that the pouring of water _created_ the air instead only of displaying it.

[^54]: 25:2 All created things are called _Bhutas_, but the five principal elements, _viz_., fire, air, earth, water, and space, are especially called _Bhutas_ or _Mahabhutas_.

[^55]: 26:1 This is certainly curious as showing that the ancient Hindus knew how to treat diseased plants and restore them to vigour.

[^56]: 26:2 K.P. Singha wrongly renders this verse. The Burdwan translator is right.

[^57]: 28:1 Both the Bengal and the Bombay texts read _bhutani_. The correct reading, however, appears to be _bhutanam_.

[^58]: 28:2 The word for duct is _Srotas_. It may also be rendered ‘channel.’ Very like the principal artery or aorta.

[^59]: 28:3 Notwithstanding much that is crude anatomy and crude physiology in these sections, it is evident, however, that certain glimpses of truth were perceived by the _Rishis_ of ancient times. Verse 15 shows that the great discovery of Harvey in modern times was known in ancient India.

[^60]: 29:1 In works on yoga it is laid down that the main duct should be brought under the control of the will. The soul may then, by an act of volition, be withdrawn from the whole physical system into the convolutions of the brain in the head. The brain, in the language of yogins, is a lot us of a thousand leaves. If the soul be withdrawn into it, the living creature will then be liberated from the necessity of food and sleep, etc., and will live on from age to age, absorbed in contemplation of divinity and in perfect beatitude.

[^61]: 32:1 It is often said that in an advanced stage of yoga, one is enabled to behold one's Soul, or, a sort of double existence is realised in consequence of which the Soul becomes an object of internal survey to the Soul itself. Very probably, writers on yoga employ this language in a figurative sense.

[^62]: 32:2 The commentator explains that the words expressive of hue or colour really mean attributes. What is intended to be said is that the Brahmanas had the attribute of Goodness (_Sattwa_); the second order had the attribute of Passion (_Rajas_); the third got a mixture of the two, _i.e._, both goodness and passion (_Sattwa_ and _Rajas_); while the lowest order got the remaining attribute, _viz_., Darkness (_Tamas_).

[^63]: 33:1 The distinction here laid down seems to be this: the eternal creation is due to the yoga or mental action of the Primeval Deity. That creation which we behold is the result of the penances of those sages who were first created. Perhaps, what is intended to be said is that the principle of life, of life proceeding from life, and primal matter with space, etc., are all due to the fiat of God; while all visible and tangible objects, resulting from the action of those principles and from primal matter and space, are attributable to the ancient sages.

[^64]: 34:1 The word _Ghrina_ may also mean aversion. Of course, here it would mean, if used in that sense, aversion for all unrighteous acts.

[^65]: 34:2 The first half of the first line of 6 is differently read in the Bombay edition. Both readings are noticed by Nilakantha. I have adhered to the Bengal reading, though the Bombay reading is clearer in sense. _Visati_ is a transitive verb having _Pratishtha_ or some such noun for its object. The literal meaning is He who acquires fame, etc.

[^66]: 34:3 Here the speaker describes the character of _Karma-sannyasa_ (renunciation of acts). _Samarambha_ generally means all kinds of acts. Here, however, only sacrifices and other scriptural rites are intended. I follow Nilakantha in rendering the second line, although the plain meaning would seem to be “who poureth everything in gift.”

[^67]: 35:1 The gross world is perceivable by the ordinary senses. Behind the gross world is a subtile one which the subtile senses _i.e._, the senses when sharpened by _yoga_, can perceive. With death, the gross body alone is dissolved The subtile body or form, called the _Linga-sarira_, and made up of what is called the _Tanmatras_ of the primal elements, remains. Even that retains all the characteristics of the world in an incipient form. The _Linga-sarira_ also must be destroyed before absorption into _Brahma_ can take place.

[^68]: 36:1 The felicity that is obtained in heaven is not everlasting, being limited in point of duration by the degree or measure of merit that is achieved here.

[^69]: 36:2 The Pauranic theory of both the solar and the lunar eclipse is that the Sun and the Moon are sought to be devoured by the _Daitya_, _Rahu_.

[^70]: 36:3 The sense seems to be that Vedas declare those fruits in order that men may strive for them when they lead to happiness.

[^71]: 37:1 Nearly the whole of this section is prose.

[^72]: 37:2 It is difficult to understand in what senses the word _Dharma_ is used in the three successive questions here.

[^73]: 37:3 In the first line the correct reading is _Brahmana_ and not _Brahmarshi_. The answer attributed to Bhrigu settles this.

[^74]: 38:1 A pupil should never solicit his preceptor for instruction. He should attend only when the preceptor calls him. To this day, the rule is rigidly observed in all _Tols_ throughout India. It should be added to the credit of those engaged in teaching that they very seldom neglect their pupils. The story is authentic of the grandfather of the great Baneswar Vidyalankar of Nuddea, himself as great a professor as Baneswar, of continuing to teach his pupils in the outer apartments even after receiving intelligence of his son's death within the inner apartments of the family dwelling. The fact is, he was utterly absorbed in his work, that when his good lady, moved by his apparent heartlessness, came out to tax him he answered her, in thorough absence of mind, saying, ‘Well, do not be disturbed. If I do not weep for my son, I will do so for that grandchild in your arms.’ The pupils at last recalled him to the realities of the hour.

[^75]: 38:2 _i.e._, by picking up fallen grains from the field after the crop has been cut away and removed by the owner.

[^76]: 38:3 _Upaskara_ means renunciation.

[^77]: 39:1 It is generally said that by procreating offspring, one gratifies the _Pitris_ or pays off the debt one owes to one's deceased ancestors. Here Bhrigu says that by that act one gratifies the Creator. The idea is the same that forms the root of the command laid on the Jews,—Go and multiply.

[^78]: 39:2 The end of these attributes is _Moksha_ or Emancipation.

[^79]: 39:3 _Sishta_ is explained by Nilakantha as one who has been properly instructed by wise Preceptors.

[^80]: 40:1 _Niyama_ is explained by the commentator as a rite; _upayoga_ as a vow about food; _charyya_ as an act like visiting sacred waters; _vihita_ is _vidhana_.

[^81]: 40:2 The Hindus had no poor laws. The injunctions of their scriptures have always sufficed to maintain the poor, particularly their religious mendicants. The mendicants themselves are restrained from disturbing the householders often. None again save the well-to-do were to be visited by the mendicants, so that men of scanty means might not be compelled to support the recluses.

[^82]: 41:1 The words used by Bharadwaja in the question are capable of being construed as an enquiry after the next world. Bhrigu also, in his answer, uses the word _Paro lokah_. The reference to Himavat, therefore, is explained by the commentator as metaphorical. The whole answer of Bhrigu, however, leaves little room for doubt that the sage speaks of a region on earth and not in the invisible world after death.

[^83]: 41:2 Nilakantha would read _amritya_ for _mritya_. It is a forced correction for keeping up the metaphorical sense.

[^84]: 41:3 All knowledge there is certain.

[^85]: 41:4 _i.e._, to practise _yoga_. The Bengal reading is _dharanam_. The commentator goes or explaining all the verses as metaphorical. Considerable ingenuity is displayed by him, and he even cites the _Srutis_ in support.

[^86]: 42:1 This at least is a verse that evidently refers to the other or the next world, and, therefore, lends colour to the supposition that throughout the whole passage, it is the next world and no fictitious region north of the Himalayas that is described. Some western scholars think that a verbal translation is all that is necessary. Such passages, however, are incapable of being so rendered. The translator must make his choice of, either taking the verses in a plain or a metaphorical sense. If he inclines towards the latter, he cannot possibly give a verbal version. The genius of the two tongues are quite different.

[^87]: 42:2 Pushkara in Rajputanah is supposed to be the spot where Brahman underwent his penances.

[^88]: 42:3 The Burdwan translator makes a mess of this verse 21 runs into 22 as explained by the commentator. K.P. Singha avoids the blunder, although in rendering the last line of 22 he becomes rather inaccurate.

[^89]: 43:1 The five limbs which should be washed before eating are the two feet, the two hands, and the face.

[^90]: 43:2 This may be a general direction for washing one's hand after eating; or, it may refer to the final _Gandusha_, _i.e._, the act of taking a little water in the right hand, raising it to the lips, and throwing it down, repeating a short formula.

[^91]: 43:3 The Burdwan translator has misunderstood this verse completely.

[^92]: 43:4 It is difficult to understand what this verse means. Nilakantha proposes two different kinds of interpretation. What then is _Sankusuka_ or _Sanku cuka_? The above version is offered tentatively. The commentator imagines that the true sense of the verse is that it declares such men to be unable to attain to _Mahadayu_ which is _Brahma_ and not long life.

[^93]: 44:1 _Prishtamangsa_ is explained by the commentator as ‘the meat forming the remnant of a _Sraddha_ offering.’ I do not see the necessity of discarding the obvious meaning.

[^94]: 44:2 in the sense of being moved or used. The commentator adds that the sacred thread also should be wound round the thumb, as the _Grihyasutras_ declare.

[^95]: 44:3 In every instance, the person who receives should say—‘_All-sufficient_’ ‘_Gratify to the fill_’, and ‘_Has fallen copiously_’ or words to that effect. _Krisara_ or _Kricara_ is food made of rice and pease, or rice and sesame; probably what is now called _Khichree_.

[^96]: 44:4 The polite form of address is _Bhavan_. It is in the third person singular. The second person is avoided, being too direct.

[^97]: 45:1 It is not plain in what way the sinful acts come to the sinner. The Hindu idea, of course, is that the consequences of those deeds visit the doer without fail. This verse, however, seems to say that the recollection of those sins forces itself upon the sinner and makes him miserable in spite of himself.

[^98]: 45:2 The Hindu moralist, in this verse, declares the same high morality that Christ himself preached. Merit or sin, according to him, does not depend on the overt act alone. Both depend on the mind. Hence the injunction against even mentally harming others.

[^99]: 45:3 The sense seems to be that if one succeeds in ascertaining the ordinances about virtue or Piety, but if the mind be sinful, no associate can be of any help. The mind alone is the cause of virtue and piety.

[^100]: 45:4 _Adhyatma_ is anything that depends on the mind. Here it is, as explained by the commentator, used for _yoga-dharma_ as depending upon or as an attribute of the mind. Generally speaking, all speculations on the character of the mind and its relations with external objects are included in the word _Adhyatma_.

[^101]: 45:5 After Bhrigu's discourse to Bharadwaja this question may seem to be a repetition. The commentator explains that it arises from the declaration of Bhishma that Righteousness is a property of the mind, and is, besides, the root of everything. (V 31, sec. 193, _ante_). Hence the enquiry about _Adhyatma_ as also about the origin of all things.

[^102]: 46:1 The word rendering ‘perceptions’ is _Vijnanani_. ‘Cognitions’ would perhaps, be better.

[^103]: 46:2 Generally, in Hindu philosophy, particularly of the Vedanta school, a distinction is conceived between the mind, the understanding, and the soul. The mind is the seat or source of all feelings and emotions as also all our perceptions, or those which are called cognitions in the Kantian school, including Comparison which (in the Kantian school) is called the Vernuft or Reason. This last is called the Understanding or _buddhi_. The soul is regarded as something distinct from both the body and the mind. It is the Being to whom the body and the mind belong. It is represented as inactive, and as the all-seeing witness within the physical frame. It is a portion of the Supreme Soul.

[^104]: 46:3 Goodness includes all the higher moral qualities of man. Passion means love, affection, and other emotions that appertain to worldly objects. Darkness means anger, lust, and such other mischievous propensities.

[^105]: 47:1 I follow Nilakantha in his grammatical exposition of this verse. The meaning, however, is scarcely clear. The identity of the Understanding or intelligence with the senses and the mind may be allowed so far as the action of the three qualities in leading all of them to worldly attachments is concerned. But what is meant by the identity of the Understanding with all the objects it comprehends? Does Bhishma preach Idealism here? If nothing exists except as it exists in the Understanding, then, of course, with the extinction of the Understanding, all things would come to an end.

[^106]: 47:2 Brown and other followers of Reid, whether they understood Reid or not, regarded all the perceptions as only particular modifications of the mind. They denied the objective existence of the world.

[^107]: 47:3 The commentator explains this verse thus, although as regards the second line he stretches it a little. If Nilakantha be right, K.P. Singha must be wrong. Generally, however, it is the known incapacity of the ocean to transgress its continents that supplies poets with illustrations. Here, however, possibly, the rarity of the phenomenon, _viz_., the ocean's transgressing its continents, is used to illustrate the rare fact of the intelligence, succeeding by _yoga_ power, in transcending the attributes of _Rajas_, _Tamas_ and _Sattwa_.

[^108]: 48:1 on the other hand, directing one's thoughts boldly to it, one should ascertain its cause and dispel that cause, which, as stated here, is Passion.

[^109]: 48:2 The first two words of the second line are those of verse 5 of See, I, Manu.

[^110]: 48:3 _Kathanchit_ is explained by Nilakantha as ‘due to great ill-luck.’

[^111]: 48:4 I do not follow Nilakantha in rendering this verse.

[^112]: 48:5 The soul is said to be only a witness or spectator and not an actor. The _Rishis_ understood by the soul the being to whom the mind, the senses, etc., all belong. Could the idea of the inactive and unsinning Soul have arisen from observation of the moral principle of Conscience which discriminates between right and wrong, and acts, therefore, as an impartial judge, or watches everything like an uninterested spectator? European moralists generally attribute two other functions to the Conscience, _viz_., impelling us to do the right and avoid the wrong, and approving when right is done and wrong avoided. But these functions may easily be attributed to some other principle. At any rate, when the question is one of nomenclature only, the last two functions may be taken away and the word Soul applied to indicate the Conscience as the faculty of discrimination only.

[^113]: 49:1 The qualities here referred to are those of _Sattwa_ (goodness), _Rajas_ (passion), and _Tamas_ (darkness). What is meant by this verse is that such a person transcends the qualities instead of the qualities transcending him and his acts.

[^114]: 49:2 Nilakantha takes the third line as elliptical and is for supplying _te labhante_.

[^115]: 50:1 I follow the commentator in his exposition of this verse. _Anavisandhipurvakam_ is explained as _nishkamam_. _Ubhayam_ is _prachinamaihikam cha karmam_. _Apriyam_ is equivalent to _vadham_. The substance of _priyam_, etc., is thus given: _Moksham prati tu karmanah karanatwam duranirastam_.

[^116]: 50:2 Aturam is explained as pierced by lust, wrath, etc. _Asuyate_ is equivalent to _dhikkaroti_. _Janah_ is explained by the commentator as _parikshakah_ but it would be better to take it as standing for people generally. _Tasya_ is an instance of the genitive for the accusative. _Tat_ refers to _nindyam karma_, _sarvatah_ means _sarvashu yonishu_. _Janayati Janena dadati_. The object of the verse is to show that sinful acts produce fear both here and hereafter.

[^117]: 50:3 _Loka_ is in the locative case, the final vowel indicating to the locative having been dropped for _sandhi_. Niravishan is an adverb, equivalent to _samyak-abhinivesam kurvan_. _Tattadeva_ means “those and those” _i.e._, possessions, such as _putradaradikam_. _Kusalan_ is _sarasaravivekanipunan_. _Ubhayam_ is explained as _karma-mukhin_ and sadyomuktim. Bhisma here points out the superiority of the latter kind of Emancipation over the former; hence Vedic acts or rites must yield to that yoga which drills the mind and the understanding and enables them to transcend all earthly influences.

[^118]: 51:1 The soul-state is the state of purity. One falls away from it in consequence of worldly attachments. One may recover it by _yoga_ which aids one in liberating oneself from those attachments.

[^119]: 51:2 The three words used here are _vichara_, _viveka_, and _vitarka_. They are technical terms implying different stages of progress in _yoga_. The commentator explains them at length.

[^120]: 52:1 Everything that man has is the product of either exertion or destiny; of exertion, that is, as put forth in acts, and destiny as dependent on the acts of a past life or the will of the gods or pure chance. _Yoga_ felicity is unattainable through either of these two means.

[^121]: 52:2 _Sankhya_ is understood by the commentator as implying _Vedanta-vichara_.

[^122]: 52:3 This verse is a triplet. The commentator explains that _Vedanta_ in the second line means _Sankhya_. I think, this is said because of the agreement between the _Vedanta_ and the _Sankhya_ in this respect notwithstanding their difference in other respects. The object of the verse is to say that according to the _Sankhya_, there is no necessity for silent recitation of _mantras_. Mental meditation, without the utterance of particular words, may lead to _Brahma_.

[^123]: 53:1 Both declare, as the commentator explains, that as long as one does not succeed in beholding one's Soul, one may silently recite the _Pranava_ or the original word _Om_. When, however, one succeeds in beholding one's Soul, then may one give up such recitation.

[^124]: 53:2 There are two paths which one in this world may follow. One is called _Pravritti dharma_ and the other _Nrivritti dharma_. The first is a course of actions; the second of abstention from actions. The attributes indicated in 10 and 11 belong to the first course or path. They are, therefore, called _Pravartaka yajna_ or Sacrifice having its origin in _Pravritti_ or action.

[^125]: 53:3 _i.e._, he should first cleanse his heart by observing the virtues above enumerated.

[^126]: 53:4 _Samadhi_ is that meditation in which the senses having been all withdrawn into the mind, the mind, as explained previously, is made to dwell on Brahma alone.

[^127]: 54:1 The end declared by Bhishma in the previous section is the success of yoga, or freedom from decrepitude and death, or death at will, or absorption into Brahma, or independent, existence in a beatific condition.

[^128]: 54:2 It should be noted that ‘hell,’ as here used, means the opposite of Emancipation. Reciter may attain to the joys of heaven, but compared to Emancipation, they are hell, there being the obligation of rebirth attached to them.

[^129]: 54:3 Even this is a kind of hell, for there is re-birth attached to it.

[^130]: 54:4 _Aiswvarya_ or the attributes of godhead are certain extraordinary powers attained by _yogins_ and Reciters. They are the power to become minute or huge in shape, or go whither soever one will, etc. These are likened to hell, because of the obligation of re-birth that attaches to them. Nothing less than Emancipation or the absorption into the Supreme Soul is the end that should be striven for.

[^131]: 55:1 in the Bengal texts there is a vicious line beginning with _Prajna_, etc, The Bombay text omits it, making both 10 and 11 couplets, instead of taking 11 as a triplet.

[^132]: 55:2 _Na samyuktah_ is explained by the commentator as _aviraktopi hathena tyaktabhogah_.

[^133]: 56:1 For there no forms exist to become the objects of such functions. All is pure knowledge there, independent of those ordinary operations that help created beings to acquire knowledge.

[^134]: 56:2 The six _Angas_ are _Siksha_, _Kalpa_, _Vyakarana_, _Nirukta_, _Chhandas_, _Jyotish_.

[^135]: 56:3 _i.e._, an insight not obtained in the ordinary way but by intuition.

[^136]: 57:1 K.P. Singha mistranslates the word _sadhaye_. It means ‘I go’, and not ‘I will strive etc.’ The Burdwan translator is correct.

[^137]: 60:1 Work and Abstention from work are the two courses of duty prescribed or followed.

[^138]: 61:1 It seems that Vikrita had given away a cow. He had then made a gift to Virupa of the merit he had won by that righteous act.

[^139]: 61:2 Picking solitary grains from the crevices in the fields after the crops have been gathered and taken away.

[^140]: 61:3 He gave me the merit he won by giving away one cow. I wish to give him in return the merit I have won by giving away two cows.

[^141]: 62:1 Verses 107 and 108 are rather obscure. What the king says in 107 seems to be that you two have referred your dispute to me who am a king. I cannot shirk my duty, but am bound to judge fairly between you. I should see that kingly duties should not, so far as I am concerned, become futile. In 108 he says, being a king I should discharge the duties of a king, _i.e._, I should judge disputes, and _give_, if need be, but never _take_. Unfortunately, the situation is such that I am obliged to act as a Brahmana by _taking_ what this particular Brahmana is desirous of offering.

[^142]: 62:2 This verse also seems to be very obscure. The king's natural inclination, it seems, prompts him to oblige the Brahmana by accepting his gift. The ordinances about kingly duties restrain him. Hence his condemnation of those duties. In the second line, he seems to say that he is morally bound to accept the gift, and intends to make a gift of his own merits in return. The result of this act, he thinks, will be to make both courses of duty (_viz_., the Kshatriya, and the Brahmana's) produce the same kind of rewards in the next world.

[^143]: 63:1 This is not Emancipation, but merely terminable felicity.

[^144]: 63:2 Attains to Emancipation or Absorption in-to the essence of Brahma.

[^145]: 63:3 These are Direct knowledge (through the senses), Revelation, Inference, and Intuition.

[^146]: 63:4 The first six are Hunger, Thirst, Grief, Delusion, Disease, and Death. The other sixteen are the five breaths, the ten senses, and the mind.

[^147]: 64:1 I think, K.P. Singha misunderstands this verse. Three different ends are spoken of. One is absorption into _Brahma_; the other's enjoyment of ordinary felicity, which, of course, is terminable, and the last is the enjoyment of that felicity which is due to a freedom from desire and attachments; 126 speaks of this last kind of felicity.

[^148]: 64:2 In the second line _saraddham_ is not an indeclinable; or, if it be taken as such, the sense may still remain unaltered. What the monarch does is to call upon the Brahmana to share with the monarch the rewards that the monarch had won.

[^149]: 65:1 The sense seems to be that _yogins_ attain to _Brahma_ even here; whereas Reciters attain to him after death.

[^150]: 66:1 The fact is, I do not know anything of Him, but still I profess to worship him. This is false behaviour. How shall I be rescued from such falsehood? This is what Vrihaspati says.

[^151]: 66:2 The _Chhandas_ are the rules of Prosody as applicable to the Vedic hymns. _Jyotish_ is astronomy. It forms an _Anga_ of the Vedas. _Nirukta_ furnishes rules for interpreting obscure passages of the Vedas, and also gives the meanings of technical or obscure words used therein. _Kalpa_ is the description of religious rites. _Siksha_ is the science of Pronunciation as applied to Vedic hymns and _mantras_.

[^152]: 67:1 They who believe that happiness is not eternal and that, therefore, they should not Pursue it, withdraw themselves from pious acts which lead to that happiness. They seek Knowledge as the best means for avoiding all that is transitory and changeful. They seek _moksha_ or complete Emancipation which has been described in the previous sections.

[^153]: 67:2 The meaning of ‘hell’ as applied in such passages has been explained before.

[^154]: 67:3 This is a highly aphoristic line. I give the sense by expanding the words. By ‘acts’ here is meant ‘sacrifices and other religious observances.’ The intention of Vrihaspati is to enforce the Propriety of acts, for without acts, the ends of life cannot, he maintains, be secured.

[^155]: 67:4 The sense is that one should devote oneself to acts as a sort of preparation. Afterwards one should abandon them for obtaining the higher end. Acts, therefore, have their use, and help one, though mediately, in the acquisition of _Brahma_.

[^156]: 67:5 _The mind and acts have created all things_. This has been explained in the last verse of section 190 ante. _Both are good paths_, for by both, good end maybe attained, _viz_., the highest, by drilling the mind, as also (mediately) by acts (as explained in verse 14 above). The fruits of actions must be mentally abandoned if the highest end is to be attained; _i.e._, acts may be gone through, but their fruits should never be coveted.

[^157]: 68:1 Nilakantha explains the grammar of the first line differently. His view is _yatha chakshurupah praneta nayako_, etc. A better construction would be _yatha chaksha pranetah_ (_bhavati_) etc.

[^158]: 68:2 This verse may be said to furnish the key of the doctrine of _karma_ or acts and why acts are to be avoided by persons desirous of _Moksha_ or Emancipation. _Acts have three attributes_: for some are _Sattwika_ (good), as sacrifices undertaken for heaven, etc., some are _Rajasika_ (of the quality of Passion), as penances and rites accomplished from desire of superiority and victory; and some are _Tamasika_ (of the quality of Darkness), as those undertaken for injuring others, notably the _Atharvan_ rites of _Marana_, _Uchatana_, etc.: this being the case, the _Mantras_, without acts, cannot be accomplished, are necessarily subject to the same three attributes. The same is the case with rituals prescribed. It follows, therefore, that the mind is the chief cause of the kind of fruits won, _i.e._, it is the motive that determines the fruits, _viz_., of what kind it is to be. The enjoyer of the fruit, of course, is the embodied creature.

[^159]: 68:3 There can be no doubt that Nilakantha explains this verse correctly. It is really a cruce. The words _Naro na samsthanagatah prabhuh syat_ must be taken as unconnected and independent. _Na samsthana gatah_ is before death. _Prabhuh_ is _adhikari_ (_jnanphale_ being understood). K.P. Singha gives the sense correctly, but the Burdwan translator makes nonsense of the words.

[^160]: 68:4 The subject of this verse as explained by the commentator, is to inculcate the truth that the result of all acts accomplished by the body is heaven where one in a physical state (however subtile) enjoys those fruits. If Emancipation is to be sought, it must be attained through the mind.

[^161]: 68:5 The sense depends upon the word _acts_. If _acts_ are accomplished by the mind, their fruits must be enjoyed by the person in a state in which he will have a mind. Emancipation cannot be achieved by either recitation (japa) or _Dhyana_ (meditation), for both these are _acts_. Perfect liberation from _acts_ is necessary for that great end.

[^162]: 69:1 _viz_., Taste. etc.

[^163]: 69:2 _Existent_, line atom; _non-existent_, line space; _existent-nonexistent_, line Maya or illusion.

[^164]: 69:3 _Aswabhavam_ is explained by the commentator as _Pramatri-twadi vihinam_.

[^165]: 69:4 _i.e._, one sees one's own soul.

[^166]: 70:1 _i.e._, which, though one, divides itself into a thousand form like the image of the moon in a quantity of agitated water.

[^167]: 70:2 The analogy consists in this: good and evil fruits, though incompatible, dwell together; similarly, knowledge, though not material, resides in the material body. Of course, knowledge is used here in the sense of the mind or the understanding.

[^168]: 70:3 It is difficult to understand why the idea of lamps set on trees is introduced here.

[^169]: 70:4 The analogy is thus explained. Fire, when fed, bursts into flames. When not fed, it dies out, but is not destroyed, for with new fuel the flames may be brought back. The current of the wind ceases, but does not suffer extinction; for if it did, there would be no current again. The same is the case with the rays of the Sun. They die in the night, to reappear in the morning. The rivers are dried up in summer and refilled during the rains. The body, once dissolved, appears in another form. It will be seen that the weakness of the reasoning is due only to incorrect notions about the objects referred to.

[^170]: 70:5 _Exists in its own nature_, _i.e._, unaffected by attributes and qualities and accidents.

[^171]: 70:6 Some of the Bengal texts read _sumahan_ and _subuddhih_ in the second line. Of course, this is incorrect. The true reading is _samanah_ and _sabuddhih_, meaning ‘with mind and with understanding.’ In the Bombay edition occurs a misprint, _viz_., _sumanah_ for _samanah_. Nilakantha cites the correct readings.

[^172]: 71:1 The Burdwan translator misunderstands the word _Linga_ as used in both 14 and 15. K.P. Singha also wrongly renders that word as it occurs in 15. The commentator rightly explains that _Linga_ has no reference to _Linga-sarira_ or the invisible body composed of the _tanmatra_ of the primal elements, but simply means the gross body. In 14, he says, _Lingat sthuladehat_, _Lingam tadeva dehantaram_. In 15, anena Lingena Savibhutena. Adristhah means _alakshitah_. A little care would have removed such blunders.

[^173]: 71:2 The commentator cites the _Gita_ which furnishes a parallel passage, _viz_., _Indriyani paranyahurindriyebhyah param manah_, etc.

[^174]: 71:3 This verse seems to show that the _Rishis_ had knowledge of spectacles, and probably also, of microscopes. The instrument that shewed minute objects must have been well known, otherwise some mention would have been made of it by name. The commentator calls it _upanetra_.

[^175]: 72:1 By death on sleep.

[^176]: 72:2 _Yugapat_ means simultaneous: _atulyakalam_ means differing in point of time in respect of occurrence: _kritsnam_ qualifies _indriyartham_; _Vidwan_ means _Sakshi_; and _ekah_, independent and distinct. What is intended to be said here is that when the soul, in a dream, musters together the occurrences and objects of different times and places, when, in fact, congruity in respect of both time and place does not apply to it, it must be regarded to have an existence that is distinct and independent of the senses and the body.

[^177]: 72:3 The object of this is to show that the Soul has only knowledge of the pleasures and pains arising in consequence of _Sattwa_ and _Rajas_ and _Tamas_ and in connection with the three states of the understanding due to the same three attributes. The Soul, however, though knowing them, does not enjoy or suffer them. He is only the silent and inactive Witness of everything.

[^178]: 72:4 The object of the simile is to show that as wind is a separate entity although existing _with_ the fire in a piece of wood, so the Soul, though existing with the senses is distinct from them.

[^179]: 72:5 The Bengal texts read _indriyanam_ which I adopt. The Bombay edition reads _indriyendriyam_, meaning the sense of the senses, in the same way as the _Srutis_ declare that is the _Prana_ of _Prana_, the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear, etc., Sravanena darsanam tatha kritam is ‘apprehended by the ear,’ _i.e._, as rendered above, ‘apprehended through the aid of the _Srutis_.’

[^180]: 73:1 The commentator uses the illustration of a tree. Before birth the tree was not; and after destruction, it is not; only in the interim, it is. Its formlessness or nothingness is manifest from these two states, for it has been said that which did not exist in the past and will not exist in the future cannot be regarded as existing in the present. _Tadgatah_ is explained by the commentator as _udayastamanagatah_ or _taddarsinah_.

[^181]: 73:2 Both the vernacular translators render the second line incorrectly. The first line is elliptical, and would be complete by supplying _asannam pasyanti_. The paraphrase of the second line is _Pratyayannam Jneyam Jnanabhisamhitam_(_prati_)_ninisante_. _Jneyam_ is explained by the commentator as _prapancham_. _Jnanabhisamhitam_ means that which is known by the name of Knowledge, _i.e._, _Brahma_, which has many similar names some of which the commentator quotes such as Satyam (truth), _Jananam_ (knowledge), Anantam (infinite), Vijnanam (true knowledge), Anandam (joy or happiness).

[^182]: 74:1 _Tamas_ is another name for Rahu. The first line, therefore, refers to the manner in which an eclipse occurs. There is no absolute necessity, however, for taking it as an allusion to the eclipse. The meaning may be more general. Every day, during the lighted fortnight, the moon gains in appearance, as, indeed, every day, during the dark fortnight, it loses in appearance. It may, therefore, be said that darkness approaches it or leaves it for eating it away or discovering it more and more. The actual process of covering and discovering cannot be noticed. This circumstance may be taken as furnishing the simile. In verse 21, similarly, _tamas_ is capable of a wider meaning. In 22, the word _Rahu_ is used. It should be explained, however, that Rahu is no imaginary monster as the Puranas describe but the descending node of the moon, _i.e._, a portion of space in and about the lunar orbit.

[^183]: 74:2 This is a very difficult verse and the distinction involved in it are difficult to catch. Of course, I follow the commentator in rendering it. What is said here is that in a dream, _Vyakta_ (manifest body) lies inactive, while the _Chetanam_ (the subtile form) walks forth. In the state called _Sushupti_ (deep slumber which is like death) the _indriyasamyuktam_ (the subtile form) is abandoned, and _Jnanam_ (the Understanding), detached from the former, remains. After this manner, _abhava_ (non-existence, _i.e._, Emancipation) results from destruction of _bhavah_ or existence as subject to its known conditions of dependence on time, manner of apprehension, etc., for Emancipation is absorption into the Supreme Soul which is independent of all the said conditions. The commentator explains that these observations become necessary to show that Emancipation is possible. In the previous section the speaker drew repeated illustrations for showing that the soul, to be manifest, depended on the body. The hearer is, therefore, cautioned against the impression that the soul's dependence on the body is of such an indissoluble kind that it is incapable of detachment from the body, which of course, is necessary for Emancipation or absorption into the Supreme Soul.

[^184]: 75:1 _Caswasasya_ is an instance of _Bhavapradhananirdesa_, _i.e._, of a reference to the principal attribute connected by it.

[^185]: 75:2 _Indriaih rupyante_ or _nirupyante_, hence _Indriyarupani_.

[^186]: 75:3 The objects to be abandoned are those which the senses apprehend and those which belong to primordial matter. Those last, as distinguished from the former, are, of course, all the _linga_ or subtile forms or existents which are made up of the _tanmatras_ of the grosser elements.

[^187]: 75:4 Or, regains his real nature.

[^188]: 75:5 I adopt the Bombay reading _aptavan_ instead of the Bengal reading _atmavit_. _Pravrittam Dharmam_, as explained previously, is that _Dharma_ or practice in which there is _pravritti_ and not _nivritti_ or abstention.

[^189]: 76:1 The sense is this: by abstaining from the objects of the senses one may conquer one's desire for them. But one does not succeed by that method alone in totally freeing oneself from the very principle of desire. It is not till one succeeds in beholding one's soul that one's principle of desire itself becomes suppressed.

[^190]: 76:2 The separate existence of an objective world is denied in the first clause here. All objects of the senses are said here to have only a subjective existence; hence the possibility of their being withdrawn into the mind. The latest definition of matter, in European philosophy, is that it is a permanent possibility of sensations.

[^191]: 76:3 _Te_ is explained by the commentator as _Brahmabhigatah_. K.P. Singha wrongly renders the last foot of the second line. The Burdwan version is correct.

[^192]: 77:1 _Te_ in the first line is equal to _tava_.

[^193]: 77:2 I follow the commentator in so far as he is intelligible. It is evident that the words _Jnanam_ and _Jneyam_ are used in the original not consistently throughout.

[^194]: 77:3 The meaning seems to be this: ordinary men regard all external objects as possessing an independent existence, and their attributes also as things different from the substances which own them. The first step to attain to is the conviction that attributes and substances are the same, or that the attributes are the substances. This accords with the European Idealism. The next stage, of course, is to annihilate the attributes themselves by contemplation. The result of this is the attainment of _Brahma_.

[^195]: 78:1 _Antaratmanudarsini_ is explained by the commentator as "that which has the _Antaratman_ for its _anudarsin_ or witness. The Burdwan translator is incorrect in rendering the second line.

[^196]: 79:1 The first ‘knowledge’ refers to the perception of the true connection between the Soul and the not-Soul. ‘Fruits’ mean the physical forms that are gained in new births. The destruction of the understanding takes place when the senses and the mind are withdrawn into it all of them, united together, are directed towards the Soul. _Jneyapratishthitam Jnanam_ means, of course, knowledge of _Brahma_.

[^197]: 79:2 The commentator explains that sorrow arises from the relation of the knower and the known. All things that depend upon that relation are transitory. They can form no part of What is eternal and what transcends that relation.

[^198]: 79:3 I take the obvious meaning, instead of the learned explanation offered by Nilakantha.

[^199]: 80:1 The very _Yogins_, if led away by the desire of acquiring extraordinary powers and the beatitude of the highest heaven do not behold the Supreme.

[^200]: 80:2 _Gunam_, literally, attributes; hence objects possessed of attributes.

[^201]: 80:3 That which is called the external world has no objective existence. It is purely subjective. Hence, it is the mind that sees and hears and touches the mind itself.

[^202]: 80:4 This verse is a cruce. There can be no doubt that Nilakantha's explanation is correct. Only, as regards _budhyavara_ I am disposed to differ from him very slightly. The grammar of the first line is this; ‘Gunadane manah sada budhiyaraya; viprayoge cha tesham budhyavaraya.’ Now ‘Gunadana’ means the ‘adana’ (destruction) of ‘guna’. (This root _da_ means to cut). What is meant by the destruction of ‘guna’ or attribute or earthly objects is merging them in the _buddhi_ by _yoga_; in other words, a withdrawal of the senses into the mind, and the senses and the mind into the understanding. “Viprayoga cha tesham” means ‘in their separation,’ _i.e._, when these objects are believed to be real and as existing independently of the mind. The result of this would be the acquisition of ‘budhyavara,’ implying the acquisition of those very objects. In the case of yogins, whose minds may be in such a frame, the powers called ‘asiswaryya’ are acquired. There is no especial necessity, however, for taking the case of yogins.

[^203]: 81:1 What is said here is that Happiness and Sorrow have an end, though it may not be seen, and the Soul will surely come to its final resting place. This accords with the doctrine of infinite spiritual improvement.

[^204]: 82:1 _Rishavam sarvattwam_ literally means ‘the bull of _Sattwatas_’. Ordinarily, it is an appellation of Krishna, the prince of the _Sattwatas_ or Yadavas. Here, however, the word is used to signify persons prizing the attribute of Goodness; hence righteous persons.

[^205]: 82:2 _Prajapati_ literally means ‘lord of creatures.’ It is a name applied to those sons of Brahman who begat children.

[^206]: 83:1 _Samavartin_ is another name for Yama the punisher of the wicked.

[^207]: 83:2 _Nirapekshan_ is explained by Nilakantha as _nirayameva ikshante tan_, _i.e._, those who have their gaze directed towards hell alone. The Burdwan translator takes it as indicative of houseless or nomadic habits, upon what authority, it is not plain.

[^208]: 83:3 K.P. Singha takes _Naravara_ as the name of a tribe. Of course, it is a careless blunder.

[^209]: 84:1 I think K.P. Singha misunderstands this verse. All the texts agree in reading it in the same way. To take it, therefore, as implying that the sinful races, by warring with one another, suffered destruction is doing violence to the word _Rajanath_. There can be no doubt that _Sandhyakala_ means the period of junction between the two ages (Treta and Dwapara). It is called terrible. It was at this time that, that dreadful famine occurred which compelled the royal sage Viswamitra to subsist on a canine haunch. Vide Ante.

[^210]: 84:2 The correct reading is _Mahatmana_ (instrumental) implying _Krishna_. The Bengal reading _Mahatmavan_ is vicious. K.P. Singha has rendered the verse correctly. The Burdwan translator, with Nilakantha's note before him (for he uses the very words of the commentator), adheres to the vicious reading and mistranslates the verse.

[^211]: 84:3 This verse evidently shows that there was dispute about Krishna's supremacy, as Professor Weber guesses The Krishna-cult was at first confined among a small minority, Sisupala's and Jarasandha's unwillingness to admit the divinity of Krishna distinctly points to this.

[^212]: 87:1 This is certainly a very fanciful etymology of the word Sanatana which ordinarily implies eternal.

[^213]: 87:2 _Atma Atmanah_ is explained by Nilakantha as _jivasya paramarthikam swarupam_.

[^214]: 87:3 _Swamatmanam_ is _Pratyathatmyam_.

[^215]: 88:1 The sense is that when all men are equal in respect of their material cause, why are such differences in the _srutis_ and the _smritis_ about the duties of men?

[^216]: 89:1 The meaning seems to be this: in the beginning of every celestial _yuga_, _i.e._, when the Supreme Being awaking from sleep desires to create creatures anew, an creatures or beings start again into life. With such starting of every being, the rules that regulate their relations and acts also spring up, for without a knowledge of those rules, the new creation will soon be a chaos and come to an end. Thus when man and woman start into life, they do not eat each other but combine to perpetuate the species. With the increase of the human species, again, a knowledge springs up in every breast of the duties of righteousness and of the diverse other practices, all of which help to regulate the new creation till the Creator himself, at the end of the _yuga_, once more withdraws everything into himself.

[^217]: 90:1 _i.e._, the body.

[^218]: 91:1 What is meant seems to be this: there can be no river without water. A river cannot exist without water. When a river is mentioned, water is implied. The connection between a river and water is not an accident but a necessary one. The same may be said of the sun and its rays. After the same manner, the connection between the Soul and the body is a necessary one and not an accident. The Soul cannot exist without a body. Of course, the ordinary case only is referred to here, for, by _yoga_, one can dissociate the Soul from the body and incorporate it with _Brahma_.

[^219]: 91:2 The mind his no existence except as it exists in the Soul. The commentator uses the illustration of the second moon seen by the eye in water, etc., for explaining the nature of the Mind. It has no real existence as dissociated from the Soul.

[^220]: 91:3 _Swabhavahetuja bhavah_ is explained by the commentator as the virtuous and vicious propensities. (_Swabhava purvasamskara; sa eva heturyesham karmanam layah bhavah_). ‘All else,’ of course, means _Avidya_ or _Maya_, which flows directly from Brahma without being dependent on past acts. The meaning, then, is this: as soon as the Soul takes a new form or body, all the propensities and inclinations, as dependent on its past acts, take possession of it, _Avidya_ or _Maya_ also takes possession of it.

[^221]: 92:1 Both the vernacular translators have wrongly rendered this verse, notwithstanding the help they have derived from Nilakantha's gloss. The fact is, the gloss itself sometimes requires a gloss. Verses 3 and 4 and connected with each other. In verse, 3, the speaker mentions two analogies _viz_., first, that of iron, which is inanimate, following the loadstone, and, second, of _Swabhavahetuja bhavah_ (meaning, as already explained, all such consequences as are born of the acts of previous lives), as also _anyadapi_, _i.e._, all else of a similar nature, meaning, of course, the consequences of ‘_Avidya_’ or ‘_Maya_’ which flow directly from Brahma instead of former acts. In verse 4, reference is again made to _avyaktajabhavah_, meaning propensities and possessions born of ‘_Avidya_’ or ‘_Maya_’. This is only a repetition, in another form, of what has already been stated in the second line of verse 3. The commentator explains this very clearly in the opening words of his gloss. After this comes the reference to the higher propensities and aspirations that are in the Soul. The grammar of the line is this: _Tadvat Kartuh karanalakshanah_ (_bhavah_) _karanat abhisanghathah_. The plain meaning, of course, is that like all the darker and indifferent propensities and possessions that come to the Soul in its new life, born of the acts of past lives, all the higher aspirations also of the Soul come to it from _Brahma_ direct. The word _karana_ is used in both instances for Brahma as the Supreme Cause of everything.

[^222]: 92:2 The sense is this: In the beginning there was nothing save the Chit-Soul. Existent objects exist only because of Ignorance having defiled the Soul. Their connection again with the Soul is not absolute and necessary, That connection may be destroyed without the Soul losing anything. What is intended to be conveyed by this verse is that at first, _i.e._, before the creation, there was nothing, except _jiva_ or the Soul with Knowledge alone for its indicating attribute. The things mentioned, _viz_., earth, etc., were not. Nor do they inhere to _jiva_ with even Ignorance or Delusion for its indicating attribute, _i.e._, to the _born_, Soul. The born Soul may seem to manifest all those attributes, but it is really independent of or separate from them. Their connection with the Soul, as already said, is neither absolute nor eternal. In the next verse, the speaker explains the nature of those manifestations.

[^223]: 92:3 The connection between earth, etc., with the Soul has before been said to be neither absolute nor eternal. Whence then that connection? In 6, it is said that all the apprehensions of the Soul with regard to earth, etc., are due to Ignorance or Delusion flowing directly from _Brahma_ and assailing it thereafter. The apprehension of the Soul that it is a man or an animal, that it has a body, that it is acting, etc., are to borrow the commentator's illustration, just like that of one's being a king in a dream who is not, however, really a king, or of one's being a child who is not, however, really a child. Being eternal or without beginning its first existence under the influence of Delusion is untraceable. As long, again, as it has Knowledge alone for its attribute, it remains indestructible, _i.e._, free from the mutations of existence. It occurs in every creature, _i.e._, in man and beast.

[^224]: 93:1 The sense seems to be this: In consequence of desires the Soul manifests itself in some form of existence. In that state it acts. Those acts again lead to desires anew, which, in their turn, bring on new forms or states of existence. The circle of existence or life thus goes on, without beginning and without end.

[^225]: 93:2 The Cause is ignorance. The Effect is the body and the senses of a particular form of existence. When the creature, in consequence of this union, engages in acts, these latter become causes for new states of existence.

[^226]: 93:3 The object of this verse is to reiterate the doctrine that the possession of the body and the senses, etc., does not after the state of the Soul. The Soul is really unattached to these though it may apparently exist in a state of union with them, like the wind, which existing in a state of apparent union with the dust it bears away is even at such times pure by itself and as a substance, exists separately.

[^227]: 94:1 The Vedas contain declarations of both kinds, ix., they urge to action as also to abstention from action. The former is necessary as a stepping stone to the latter. Such men are rare as understand the declarations of the Vedas in this way and as conform by their conduct to those declarations thus. What is seen, on the other hand, is that some betake themselves to acts and some to abstention from acts. The second line of the verse has been expanded a little in the translation, following Nilakantha's gloss.

[^228]: 94:2 _Deha-yapanam_ means destruction of the connection the body has with the soul. In the second line, the performance of acts is prescribed only as a preparation, for act contribute to purity of the Soul. Acts should not, the speaker says, be performed from desire of fruit, _viz_., heaven, by one desirous of Emancipation. K.P. Singha omits the first line of the verse, but gives the sense of the second line correctly. The Burdwan translator mis-understands the gloss he quotes and makes nonsense of the verse.

[^229]: 94:3 _Vipakram_ is explained by Nilakantha as _pakahinam_; and _apakvakashayakhyam_ as _apakva-kashaye pumsi akhya upadesah yasya lam_ etc.

[^230]: 94:4 _Anuplavan_ is _anusaran_; _akramya_ means _upamridya_.

[^231]: 94:5 _Vijnana_ here means the loss or absence of knowledge.

[^232]: 95:1 _Yathartham_, _i.e._, for the true objects of life, _viz_., for acting righteously and accomplishing emancipation.

[^233]: 95:2 At first there was only _jiva_ or the Soul having knowledge alone for its attribute. When it became clothed with Ignorance, the universe sprang up around it. Consciousness is due to that union of the Soul with Ignorance. Hence, all things rest on Consciousness, and Consciousness is the root of all sorrow.

[^234]: 95:3 The sense of this verse seems to be this: if all things rest on Consciousness which is an attribute of Ignorance or Delusion, why then this uniformity instead of the irregularity that characterises all perceptions in dreams? The answer is that the uniformity is the result of Past acts, of acts which are due to Consciousness. These produce uniformity of perceptions even as time, subject to its own laws, produces the phenomena of the seasons with uniformity.

[^235]: 96:1 I have expanded the last line for bringing out the meaning of the word _nasyati_ clearly. Of course, I follow Nilakantha's explanation of the simile.

[^236]: 97:1 In the _Srutis_ it is said that Brahma has two attributes, _Vidya_ (Knowledge), and _Avidya_ (Ignorance) with _Maya_ (delusion). it is in consequence of this Maya that _chit-souls_ or _jivas_ become attached to worldly things. It is in consequence of this Maya that persons, even when they understand that all is nought, cannot totally dissociate themselves from them.

[^237]: 97:2 _Mana_ is explained by the commentator as worship of one's own self; _Darpa_ is freedom from all restraints; and _Ahankara_ is a complete disregard of others and centering all thoughts on ones own self. Here _Ahankara_ is _not_ Consciousness.

[^238]: 97:3 _Kritalakshanah_ is explained by the Commentator as _Kritaswikarah_.

[^239]: 97:4 The force of the simile lies in this: _Prakriti_ binds _Kshetrajna_ or the Soul and obliges it to take birth, etc. Women are _Prakriti_, men are Souls. As the Soul should seek to avoid the contact of _Prakriti_ and strive for emancipation, even so should men seek to avoid women. It should be added that women, in almost all the dialects of India derived from Sanskrit, are commonly called _Prakriti_ or symbols of _Prakriti_, thus illustrating the extraordinary popularity of the philosophical doctrine about _Prakriti_ and _Purusha_.

[^240]: 97:5 _Kritya_ is _mantra_\-power or the efficacy of _Atharvan_ rites. What is said here is that women are as frightful as _Atharvan_ rites which can bring destruction upon even unseen foes. _Rajasi antarhitah_ means that they are sunk so completely in that attribute as to become invisible, _i.e._, completely enveloped by that attribute.

[^241]: 98:1 The sense is this: parasitical vermin spring from sweat and other filth emitted by the body. Children spring from the vital seed. In the former case, it is _Swabhava_ (nature) that supplies the active energy. In the latter, the undying influence of previous acts and propensities supply the active force. One's offspring, therefore, are like parasitical vermin on one's body. Wisdom should teach disregard or indifference for either.

[^242]: 98:2 This is a repetition of what has been asserted in various forms before. _Rajas_ (passion) is the cause of _Pravritti_ or propensity for acts. _Sattwa_ (goodness) is enlightenment or the higher aspirations that lead to _Brahma_. Both rest on _Tamas_ (Darkness), the first immediately, the last mediately. _Chit_ or _Jiva_ is pure Knowledge. When overtaken by _Tamas_ or _Avyakta_, it becomes clothed with that existence which is called life or which we realise in the world, the conditions of that life being Consciousness and Intelligence.

[^243]: 98:3 The _Chit_ or Soul is all-Knowledge. When overspread with Ignorance or Darkness, it becomes manifested by Intelligence and Consciousness, _i.e._, assumes a form or body. Knowledge overspread by Darkness, therefore, or Knowledge with the attributes of Intelligence and Consciousness, is the cause of _Chit_ or soul or _Jiva_ assuming a body. Such knowledge, therefore, is called the _seed_ of the body. Then, again, the _tadvijam_ (the second expression), _i.e._, the foundation on which knowledge overspread by ignorance (or knowledge with the attributes of intelligence and consciousness) rests, is, of course, pure Knowledge or _chit_ or _jiva_ or Soul as it existed before life. It is only another form of repeating a statement made several times before. Both the vernacular translators have misunderstood the last half of the second line.

[^244]: 99:1 The meaning, of course, is that while in the mother's womb, the Soul remembers the acts of past lives, and those acts influence and determine the growth of its senses as also the character it will display in its new life.

[^245]: 99:2 I do not follow Nilakantha in his grammatical exposition of the second line. That exposition seems to be very far-fetched. Besides _tebhyah tyagat_ for _tesham tyagat_ is no violence to grammar, the use of the ablative in this sense not being infrequent in these writings.

[^246]: 99:3 Women have before (_vide_ verse 9 of this section) been said to be the embodiment of the senses and as _antarhitah_ in _Rajas_ or Passion. The senses, therefore, are, it is concluded here, originated in _Rajas_. By the destruction, again, of _Rajas_, they may be destroyed. What is wanted, therefore, is the conquest of _Rajas_ or Passion. This may be effected with the aid of the eye whose vision has been sharpened by scriptural knowledge.

[^247]: 99:4 After _indriyartham_, as explained by the commentator, _prapyapi_ is understood. There are two classes of _indriyas_, _viz_., those of knowledge and those for the performance of acts. _Escapes the obligation of rebirth_, _i.e._, attains to Emancipation.

[^248]: 100:1 _Arthasamanyam_ is explained by Nilakantha as _Phalasamyam Mokshakhyam niratisayam_. The Burdwan translator, while using the very words of the commentator, mistranslates this verse: The speaker desires to show the difference between the religion of _Pravritti_ or acts and that of _Nivritti_ or abstention from acts. Those that follow the former cannot attain to Emancipation. What they gain are certain good qualities mentioned in the next verse, which, however, are equally gained by the followers of the religion of _Nivritti_.

[^249]: 100:2 The vow of _Krichcchra_ consists of certain fasts. Pass three days in water, _i.e._, stand in tank or stream with water up to the chin.

[^250]: 100:3 The three _Riks_ begin with _Ritancha_, _Satyancha_ etc. Every Brahmana who knows his morning and evening prayers knows these three Riks well.

[^251]: 101:1 “With the aid of the mind” means yoga _Dehakarma_ means one whose acts are undertaken only for the purpose of sustaining the body, _i.e._, one who does no act that is not strictly necessary for supporting life; hence, as the commentator explains, one who is free from all propensities leading to external objects. _Manovaham Pranan nudan_, _i.e._, bringing to sending the vital breaths to the duct called _Manovaha_ or _Sushumna_. Though a physical act, its accomplishment becomes possible only by a long course of penances consisting in the withdrawal of the mind from external objects. “Reducing the (three) attributes to a state of uniformity,” as explained by the commentator, means arriving at _Nirvikalpa_, _i.e._, at that state of knowledge which is independent of the senses.

[^252]: 102:1 The Knowledge here spoken of is that knowledge which is independent of the senses. What the speaker says is that such Knowledge is no myth but is sure to arise. When it arises, its possessor comes to know that the external world, etc., is only the mind transformed, like the sights seen and sounds heard and thoughts cherished in a dream. In the second line the results of that knowledge are declared. The mind of a Mahatma is _mantra-siddha_, _i.e._, has won success by the meditation of the initial _mantra_, or _om_; it is _nitya_, _i.e._, eternal, meaning probably that though the result of _Maya_ or _Avidya_, it is no longer subject to rebirth; it is _virajas_, _i.e._, free from desire and passion, and lastly it is _Jyotishmat_ or luminous, meaning Omniscient and Omnipotent. The commentator cites a passage from Vasishtha's treatise on _yoga_ which declares the same results as consequent on the attainment of Knowledge. It is, of course, implied that in attaining to such a state, the mind as mind must be destroyed or merged into the Soul and the Soul, with knowledge only for its attribute, must exist. In the previous verse emancipation after death has been spoken of. In this _jivan-mukti_ or emancipation in life is referred to.

[^253]: 102:2 “Freeing oneself from the attributes of Passion and Darkness”, _i.e._, by practising the religion of abstention from acts.

[^254]: 102:3 _Adatte_ from _da_ meaning to cut or destroy. _Manasam volam_ as explained by the commentator, is _sankalpam_, _i.e._, desires or purposes. The man of ripe understanding, by doing this, attains to that knowledge which is not subject to decay with age. Hence, such knowledge is superior to knowledge acquired in the ordinary way.

[^255]: 103:1 Compassion may sometimes lead to excess of attachment, as in the case of Bharata towards his little deer. The universe is the result of acts because acts determine the character of the life the soul assumes. In the case of Bharata, he was obliged to take birth as a deer in his next life in consequence of all his thoughts in the previous life having been centred on a deer.

[^256]: 103:2 K.P. Singha wrongly translates this verse. _Tat_ should be supplied before _asnute_; there is redundant _va_ in the first line. The Burdwan translator renders it correctly.

[^257]: 103:3 The _buddhi_ here referred to is intelligence cleansed by scriptures. _Samahitam manak_ is, as explained by the commentator, mind freed from anger and malice, etc., _i.e._, properly trained.

[^258]: 103:4 One should not covet, etc., like kingdoms and thrones in the case of ordinary men. “Non-existent objects,” such as sons and wives that are dead or that are unborn or unwed.

[^259]: 103:5 _Samsara_, as explained by the commentator, means both this and the other world. It is bound in speech in this sense, _viz_., that whatever is spoken is never destroyed and affects permanently both the speaker and the listener, so that not only in one life, but in the infinite course of lives, the speaker will be affected for good or for evil by the words that escape his lips. This fully accords with the discovery of modern science, so eloquently and poetically enunciated by Babbage, of the indestructibility of force or energy when once applied. How appalling is the sanction (which is not a myth) under which evil speaking is forbidden.

[^260]: 103:6 Such self-disclosure destroys the effects of those acts and prevents their recurrence.

[^261]: 104:1 Robbers laden with booty are always in danger of seizure. Even so unintelligent men bearing the burdens of life are always liable to destruction.

[^262]: 104:2 _Nishpraiharena_ means _Niruddhena_ as explained by the commentator.

[^263]: 104:3 I adopt the reading prakasela and the interpretation that Nilakantha puts upon it.

[^264]: 104:4 K.P. Singha translates these words very carelessly. The Burdwan translator, by following the commentator closely, has produced a correct version. _Kulmasha_ means ripe grains or seeds of the Phaselous radiatus. _Pinyaka_ is the cake of mustard seed or sesamum after the oil has been pressed out. _Yavaka_ means unripe barley, or, as the commentator explains, raw barley powdered and boiled in hot water.

[^265]: 105:1 What is meant by the first line of the verse is this. The Soul had, before the creation, only Knowledge for its attribute. When Ignorance or Delusion, proceeding from Supreme _Brahma_, took possession of it, the Soul became an ordinary creature, _i.e._, consciousness, mind, etc., resulted. This Ignorance, therefore, established itself upon Knowledge and transformed the original character of the Soul. What is stated in the second line is that ordinary knowledge which follows the lead of the understanding is affected by ignorance, the result of which is that the Soul takes those things that really spring from itself to be things different from itself and possessing an independent existence.

[^266]: 105:2 The correct reading, I apprehend, is _upagatasprihah_ and not _apagatasprihah_. Nilakantha is silent. All that he says is that the first verse has reference to ‘yogins,’ the second to _yogins_ and ‘non-_yogins_’ alike. Both the vernacular translators adhere to _apagatasprihah_.

[^267]: 106:1 I expand verse 8 a little for giving its meaning more clearly than a literal version would yield. All the impressions, it is said here, in dreams, are due either to the impressions of this life or those received by, the mind in the countless lives through which it has passed. All those impressions, again, are well-known to the Soul though memory may not retain them. Their reappearance in dreams is due to the action of the Soul which calls them up from the obscurity in which they are concealed. Avisena's theory of nothing being ever lost that is once acquired by the mind and the recollection of a past impression being, due to a sudden irradiation of the divine light, was, it seems, borrowed from Hindu philosophy.

[^268]: 106:2 The sense is this: a particular attribute among the three, _viz_., Goodness or Passion or Darkness, is brought to the mind by the influence of past acts of either this or any previous life. That attribute immediately affects the mind in a definite way. The result of this is that the elements in their subtile forms actually produce the images that correspond with or appertain to the affecting attribute and the manner in which it affects the mind.

[^269]: 106:3 Nothing less than _yoga_ can discard or destroy them, for they really spring from desires generated by past acts.

[^270]: 106:4 The Bombay reading _Manohrishyan_ is better.

[^271]: 106:5 Both the external and the internal worlds are due to Consciousness, which, in its turn, arises from delusion affecting the Soul. That which is called the Mind is only a product of the Soul. The world both external and internal, is only the result of Mind as explained in previous sections. Hence the Mind exists in all things. What is meant by all things existing in the Soul is that the Soul is omniscient and he who succeeds in knowing the Soul wins omniscience.

[^272]: 107:1 The body is called the door of dreams because the body is the result of past acts, and dreams cannot take place till the Soul, through past acts, becomes encased in a body. What is meant by the body disappearing in the mind is that in dreamless slumber the mind Mo longer retains any apprehension of the body. The body being thus lost in the mind, the mind (with the body lost in it) enters the Soul, or becomes withdrawn into it. _Nidarsanam_ is explained as _Nischitadarsanam Sakshirupam_. The sense of the verse is that in dreamless slumber the senses are withdrawn into the mind; the mind becomes withdrawn into the Soul. It is the Soul alone that then lives in its state of original purity, consciousness and all things which proceed from it disappearing at the time.

[^273]: 107:2 _i.e._, the mind becoming pure, he gains omniscience and omnipotence.

[^274]: 107:3 The Burdwan translator, using the very words of Nilakantha, jumbles them wrongly together and makes utter nonsense of both the original and the gloss.

[^275]: 107:4 _Brahma_ cannot, as the commentator properly explains, be seized like a creature by the horns. All that one can do is to explain its nature by reason and analogy. It can be comprehended only in the way indicated, _i.e._, by _Pratyahara_.

[^276]: 108:1 The commentator thinks that the _Rishi_ alluded to in this verse is Narayana, the companion and friend of Nara, both of whom had their retreat on the heights of Vadari where Vyasa afterwards settled himself. Tattwa here does not, the commentator thinks, mean a topic of discourse but that which exists in original purity and does not take its colour or form from the mind. _Anaropitam rupam yasya tat_.

[^277]: 108:2 The religion of _Pravritti_ consists of acts. It cannot liberate one from rebirth. The whole chain of existences, being the result of acts, rests upon the religion of _Pravritti_. The religion of _Nivritti_, on the other hand, or abstention from acts, leads to Emancipation or Brahma.

[^278]: 108:3 Nidarsarkah is explained by the commentator as equivalent to _drashtum ichcchan_.

[^279]: 108:4 _Avyakta_ or Unmanifest is _Prakriti_ or primordial matter both gross and subtile. That which transcends both _Prakriti_ and _Purusha_ is, of course the Supreme Soul or Brahma. _Visesham_, is explained by the commentator as ‘distinguished from everything else by its attributes.’

[^280]: 108:5 _i.e._, as the commentator explains, _Purusha_ is non-creating and transcends the three attributes.

[^281]: 108:6 Asamhatau is explained by the commentator as _atyantaviviktau_. _Purushau_ implies the two _Purushas_, _i.e._, the ‘_Chit_\-Soul’ and the Supreme Soul.

[^282]: 109:1 The four topics are these: the points of resemblance between _Prakriti_ and _Purusha_, the points of difference between them: the points of resemblance between _Purusha_ and _Iswara_; and the points of difference between them. The four considerations that cover these topics are absence of beginning and end, existence as chit and in animation, distinction from all other things, and the notion of activity.

[^283]: 109:2 _Yoginastam prapasyanti bhagavantam santanam_\—even this is what people always say to _yoga_ and _yogins_.

[^284]: 109:3 The commentator in a long note explains that what is really implied by this verse is that one should betake oneself to some sacred spot such as Kasi for casting off one's life there. Death at Kasi is sure to lead to Emancipation, for the theory is that _Siva_ himself becomes the instructor and leads one to that high end.

[^285]: 109:4 When divested of _Rajas_', _i.e._, freed from the senses and the propensities derived from their indulgence.

[^286]: 109:5 _Adehat_ is explained by the commentator as _Dehapatat_. _Dehantat_ applies to the destruction of all the three bodies. By the destruction (after death) of the gross body is meant escape from the obligation of rebirth. The _karana_ body is a subtiler form of existence than the _Linga-sarira_: it is, of course, existence it; _Prakriti_ as mentioned in verso 21.

[^287]: 110:1 _Paropratyasarge_ means on the rise of a knowledge of Brahma. _Niyati_ is Necessity, in consequence of which _jiva_ goes through an endless wheel of existences; _Bhavantaprabhavaprajna_ is _bhavanamanta-prabhavayorevaprajna yesham_. The object of the verse is to show that such mistaken persons as take the body, the senses, etc., and all which are not-Self, to be Self, are always taken up with the idea that things die and are born, but that there is nothing like emancipation or a complete escape from rebirth.

[^288]: 110:2 ‘By the aid of patience’ is explained by the commentator as without leaving their seats and changing the yoga attitude, etc. ‘Withdrawing themselves from the world of senses’ means attaining to a state that is perfectly independent of the senses and, therefore, of all external objects. ‘Adore the senses in consequence of their subtility,’ as explained by the commentator, is thinking of _Prana_ and the _Indriyas_ as Self or Soul. I do not understand how this amounts to the statement that such yogins attain to _Brahma_.

[^289]: 110:3 ‘Proceeding according to (the stages indicated in) the scriptures’. alludes to the well-known verses in the _Gita_, beginning with _Indriyebhyah parahyartha_, etc. The several stages, as mentioned in those verses, are as follows: Superior to the senses are their objects. Superior to the objects is the mind. Superior to the mind is the understanding. Superior to the understanding is the Soul. Superior to the Soul is the Unmanifest. Superior to the Unmanifest is _Purusha_ (_Brahma_). There is nothing above _Purusha_. _Dehantam_ is explained as that which is superior to _Avyakta_ or Unmanifest, hence _Brahma_ or _Purusha_.

[^290]: 110:4 A flash of lightning repeatedly realised becomes a mass of blazing light. Perhaps this is intended by the speaker.

[^291]: 110:5 In the Bengal texts, verse 28 is a triplet. In the second line the correct reading is _Dehantam_.

[^292]: 111:1 _Mara_, _Prakriti_, and _Purusha_, or Effects, their material Cause, and the Supreme Soul.

[^293]: 112:1 _Nanapashandavashinah_ is another reading which is noticed by the commentator. It is explained as ‘censurers of diverse sects of Lokayatikas.’

[^294]: 112:2 _Panchasrotas_ implies the mind which is said to have five currents.

[^295]: 112:3 These are the _annamaya_, the _pranamaya_, the _manomaya_, the _vijnanamaya_, and the _anandamaya_. For particulars, _vide_ Wilson's Dict.

[^296]: 112:4 The verb used is nyavedayat, literally, ‘represented,’ _i.e._, ‘started’ for discourse, or enquired into. The Burdwan translator renders it ‘exposed’ or ‘promulgated,’ which, I think, is incorrect.

[^297]: 112:5 The Burdwan translator makes a ridiculous blunder by supposing that Asuri obtained this knowledge in consequence of the questions of his disciple. The fact is, _samprishtah_, as correctly explained the commentator, means _samyak prishta prasno yasya_. K.P. Singha avoids the error.

[^298]: 112:6 Kutumvini means at matron or the wife of a house-holder.

[^299]: 113:1 Either Markandeya or Sanatkumara, according to the commentator.

[^300]: 113:2 I slightly expand _Sarvanirvedam_ according to the explanation given by Nilakantha. The Sankhya doctrine proceeds upon the hypothesis that all states of life imply sorrow. To find a remedy for this, _i.e._, to permanently escape all sorrow, is the end of that philosophy.

[^301]: 113:3 These are the characteristics of that Delusion under which man takes birth in this world and goes on living till he can permanently conquer all sorrow.

[^302]: 113:4 The construction of the first foot is _Atmano mrityuh Anatma_, meaning the Soul's death (or that which is called death) is the Soul's extinction. Verse 24 recites the opinion of the Sceptics, not that of the speaker. K.P. Singha mistranslates the verse. The Burdwan translator renders it correctly.

[^303]: 113:5 This and all the following verses are statements of the sceptic's arguments.

[^304]: 114:1 Verse 29 is highly terse. The words are grammatically unconnected with one another. Only a few substantives have been used. These represent the heads of the different arguments urged by sceptics for showing the non-existence of anything besides the body which is seen and felt. I have, of course, followed the commentator in his elaboration of the sense of the verse. There can be no doubt that the commentator is right.

[^305]: 114:2 Some idea may be formed by the English reader of the extreme terseness of these verses by attending to the elaborations contained within the parentheses above. The exigencies of English grammar as also of perspicuity have obliged me to use, even in the portions unenclosed, more words than what occur in the original Sanskrit. All these verses are cruces intended to stagger Ganesa.

[^306]: 115:1 Both the vernacular translators have rendered this verse wrongly. This fact is, without clearly understanding either the text or the gloss, they have used bits of the gloss without being able to convey any intelligible idea. The gloss sometimes requires gloss to make it intelligible. The commentator says that the theory of rebirth mentioned in verse 34 is that Of the Sugatas or Buddhists. That theory is refuted inverse 35. The objection to the Buddhistic theory is that mere ignorance and _karma_ cannot explain rebirth. There must be an indestructible Soul. This the Buddhists do not allow, for they believe that _Nirvana_ or annihilation is possible. The argument, as sketched, proceeds in this way: the being that is the result of the rebirth is apparently a different being. What right have we to assert its identity with the being that existed before? Ignorance and _karma_ cannot _create_ a Soul though they may affect the surroundings of the Soul in its new birth. The objections to the Buddhistic theory became clear in the verses that follow.

[^307]: 115:2 The sense is this: it is never seen in the world that the acts of one person affect for good or for evil another person. If Chaitra exposes himself to the night air, Maitra never catches cold for it. This direct evidence should settle the controversy about the unseen, _viz_., whether the acts of one in a previous life can affect another in a subsequent life if there be no identity between the two beings in two lives.

[^308]: 116:1 It is needless to say that I have considerably elaborated the second line of the verse, as a literal rendering would have been entirely unintelligible. For example's sake I give that rendering; “That which is separate Consciousness is also different. That from which it is, does not recommend self.”

[^309]: 116:2 If (as has already been said) the second Consciousness be the resulting effect of the loss or destruction itself of the previous Consciousness, then destruction is not annihilation, and, necessarily, after _Nirvana_ has been once attained, there may be a new Consciousness or new birth, and, thus, after having again attained to Nirvana the same result may follow. The Buddhistic _Nirvana_, therefore, cannot lead to that final Emancipation which is indicated into the Brahmanical scriptures.

[^310]: 116:3 The Buddhists then, according to this argument, are not at all benefited by asserting the existence of a permanent Soul unto which each repeated Consciousness may inhere. The Soul, according to the Brahmanical scriptures, has no attributes or possessions. It is eternal, immutable, and independent of all attributes. The affirmance of attributes with respect to the Soul directly leads to the inference of its destructibility, and hence the assertion of its permanency or indestructibility under such conditions is a contradiction in terms, according to what is urged in this verse.

[^311]: 116:4 The commentator explains that the object of this verse is to point out that the senses, when destroyed, merge into their productive causes or the substances of which they are attributes. Of course, those causes or substances are the elements or primordial matter. This leads to the inference that though attributes may meet with destruction, yet the substances (of which they are attributes) may remain intact. This may save the Buddhist doctrine, for the Soul, being permanent and owing consciousness, etc., for its attributes, may outlive, like primordial matter, the destruction of its attributes. But the speaker urges that this doctrine is not philosophical and the analogy will not hold. Substance is conjunction of attributes. The attributes being destroyed, the substance also is destroyed. In European philosophy too, matter, as an unknown essence to which extension, divisibility, etc., inhere, is no longer believed in or considered as scientific.

[^312]: 117:1 Here the speaker attacks the orthodox Brahmanical doctrine of the character of the Soul.

[^313]: 117:2 Possibly because they art based on Revelation.

[^314]: 118:1 The first five are the effects of intelligence; the vital breaths, of wind; and the juices and humours, of stomachic heat.

[^315]: 118:2 Intelligence is called _avyaya_ because it leads to Emancipation which is such. It is also called _mahat_ because of its power to lead to _Brahma_ which is _mahat_. _Tattwanischaya_ is called the seed of Emancipation because it leads to Emancipation.

[^316]: 119:1 That path consists of _yoga_.

[^317]: 119:2 By casting off the mind one casts off the five organs of action. By casting off the understanding, one casts off the organs of knowledge with the mind.

[^318]: 119:3 _i.e._, in each of these operations three causes must exist together.

[^319]: 120:1 The inference is that the functions being destroyed, the organs are destroyed, and the mind also is destroyed, or, the mind being destroyed, all are destroyed.

[^320]: 120:2 The commentator correctly explains that _na_ in _nanuparyeta_ is the nom. sing. of _nri_ (man), meaning here, of course, the dreamer. Nilakantha's ingenuity is certainly highly commendable.

[^321]: 120:3 _Uparamam_ is _yugapadbhavasya uchcchedam_ or extinction of the state of association of the Soul with the understanding, the mind, and the senses. This dissociation of the Soul from the understanding, etc., is, of course, Emancipation. Emancipation, however, being eternal, the temporary dissociation of the soul from the understanding, etc., which is the consequence of dreamless sleep, is the result of _Tamas_ or Darkness. That dissociation is certainly a kind of felicity, but then it differs from the felicity of Emancipation, which is everlasting, and which I is not experienced in the gross body.

[^322]: 121:1 In this verse the speaker points out that the felicity of Emancipation may at first sight seem to be like the felicity of dreamless sleep, but that is only an error. In reality, the former is untouched or unstained by darkness. _Na krichechramanupasyati_ is the reading I take, meaning “in which no one sees the slightest tincture of sorrow.” The kind of sorrow referred to is the sorrow of duality or consciousness of knower and known. In Emancipation, of course, there cannot be any consciousness of duality. Both the vernacular versions are thoroughly unmeaning.

[^323]: 121:2 In this verse the speaker again points out the similarity between dreamless sleep and Emancipation. In both _swakarmapratyayah_ _Gunah_ is discarded. _Gunah_, as explained by Nilakantha, means here the whole range of subjective and objective existences from Consciousness to gross material objects, _swakarmapratyayah_ means _karmahetu kavirbhava_, _i.e._, having acts for the cause of their manifestation; this refers to the theory of rebirth on account of past acts.

[^324]: 121:3 The sense of the verse is this: all creatures are perceived to exist. That existence is due to the well-known cause constituted by _Avidya_ and desire and acts. They exist also in such a way as to display a union between the body and Soul. For all common purposes of life We treat creatures that we perceive to be really existing. The question then that arises is—which (the body or the Soul) is destructible?—We cannot answer this question in any way we like, like for _swaswato va katham uchcchedavan_, _bhavet_ (_i.e._, how can the Soul, Which is said by the learned to be Eternal, be regarded as destructible?) Vartamaneshu should be treated as, _Laukikavyavareshu_. _Uchcchedah_ is, of course, equivalent to _Uchcchedavan_.

[^325]: 121:4 _i.e._, the gross body disappears in the subtile; the subtile into the _karana_ (potential) form of existence; and this last into the Supreme Soul.

[^326]: 122:1 Merit and sin, and with them their effects in the form of happiness and misery both here and hereafter, are said to be destroyed when men become unattached to everything and practise the religion of abstention or _nivritti_. The paraphrase of the second line is _asaktah alepamakasam asthaya mahati alingameva pacyanti_. _Alepamakasam asthaya_ is explained by the commentator as _Sagunam Brahma asthaya_.

[^327]: 122:2 _Urnanabha_ is generic term for all worms that weave threads from within their bellies. It does not always mean the spider. Here, it implies a silk-worm. The analogy then becomes complete.

[^328]: 122:3 _Nipatatyasaktah_ is wrongly rendered by the Burdwan translator. K.P. Singha gives the sense correctly but takes _nipatali_ for _utpatati_.

[^329]: 123:1 _Samudayah_ is explained by the commentator as equivalent to _hetu_.

[^330]: 123:2 Giving food and clothes to the poor and needy in times of scarcity is referred to.

[^331]: 124:1 The reading I adopt is _Vrataluvdhah_. If, however, the Bengal reading _vrataluplah_ be adopted, the meaning would be “such men are deceived by their vows,” the sense being that though acquiring heaven and the other objects of their desire, yet they fall down upon exhaustion of their merit and never attain to what is permanent, _viz_., emancipation, which is attainable by following the religion of nivritti only.

[^332]: 124:2 The object of Bhishma's two answers is to show that the giving of pain to others (sacrificing animals) is censurable, and the giving of pain to one's own self is equally censurable.

[^333]: 126:1 Existence comes into being and ceases. Non-existence also comes into being and ceases. This is the grammatical construction. The words, of course, imply only the appearance and disappearance of all kinds of phenomena.

[^334]: 126:2 This refers to the theory set forth in the previous sections about the Soul's real inactivity amidst its seeming activity in respect of all acts.

[^335]: 129:1 The Burdwan translator renders the second line as “six thousand Gandharvas used to dance before thee seven kinds of dance.”

[^336]: 129:2 Both the vernacular translators have misunderstood this verse. A _samya_ is explained as a little wooden cane measuring about six and thirty fingers breadth in altitude. What Vali did was to go round the Earth (_anuparyagah_, _i.e._, _parihrityagatavan_) throwing or hurling a _samya_. When thrown from a particular point by a strong man, the _samya_ clears a certain distance. This space is called a _Devayajana_. Vali went round the globe, performing sacrifices upon each such Devayajana.

[^337]: 129:3 _Pravyaharaya_ is explained by the commentator as _prakrishtokaye_.

[^338]: 130:1 I follow Nilakantha's gloss in rendering this verse. _Hatam_ is explained as _nirjivam deham_, _i.e._, the body divested of Soul. He who slays another is himself slain, means that a person who regards his own self as the slayer is steeped in ignorance, for the Soul is never an actor. By thinking that he is the actor a person invests his Soul with the attributes of the body and the senses. Such a man (as already said) is _Hatah_ or slain (_i.e._, steeped in ignorance). Comparing this with verse 19 of Sec. 11 of the _Gita_, we find that the same thing is asserted therein a slightly different way. ‘He who regards the Soul as the slayer and he who regards it as slain are both mistaken. The Soul does not slay nor is slain.’

[^339]: 131:1 Compare this with the saying usually credited to Napoleon that St. Helena was written in the book of Fate.

[^340]: 132:1 The original, if literally rendered, would be ‘Time cooks everything.’

[^341]: 132:2 _Bhujyante_ is explained by the commentator as equivalent to _palyante_ or _samhriyante_.

[^342]: 132:3 _Brahma_ is indestructible as _jiva_ or Soul, and is destructible as displayed in the form of not-Self.

[^343]: 133:1 I expand verse 50 for giving its sense as a literal version would be unintelligible.

[^344]: 134:1 One that is borne with great difficulty.

[^345]: 134:2 Literally, the desire for action; hence abundance or plenty that is the result of action or labour.

[^346]: 134:3 All these names imply plenty and prosperity.

[^347]: 134:4 _i.e._, with hands not washed after rising from his meals or while going on with his meals.

[^348]: 135:1 The commentator explains that according to the Pauranic theory, the world stands all around the mountains of _Meru_. The region of Brahman stands on its top. The Sun travels round _Meru_ and shines over all the directions or points of the compass. This happens in the age called the _Vaivaswata Manwantara_ (the age or epoch of Manu the son of Vivaswat). But after the lapse of this age, when the _Savarnika Manwantara_ comes, the sun will shine upon only the region on the top of _Meru_, and all around there will be darkness.

[^349]: 136:1 _i.e._, all things are destructible instead of being eternal.

[^350]: 136:2 The commentator explains that _Hridyam_ means _Hritstham swarupam_. By _Kalyanam_, of course, _Moksha_ or Emancipation is intended.

[^351]: 136:3 As explained in previous verses, one striving to attain Emancipation must set himself to _yoga_. As a consequence of _yoga_, one acquires (without wishing for them) many wonderful powers. The accomplishment of one's objects then follows as a matter of course.

[^352]: 137:1 The sense is this: a wise man never regards himself as the actor; and hence never feels sorrow. Whatever sorrow overtakes him he views unmoved and takes it as the result of what had been ordained. Not so the foolish man. He deems himself to be the actor and looks upon sorrow as the result of his own acts. Hence, he cannot view it unmoved. Sorrow, therefore, lies in one's regarding oneself as the actor; the true view being that one instead of being an actor is only an instrument in the hands of the great Ordainer.

[^353]: 137:2 The object of this verse is to show that right conclusions in respect of duties are very rare.

[^354]: 137:3 This is a hard hit, The listener, _viz_., Indra, had violated, under circumstances of the most wicked deception, the chastity of Gautama's spouse Ahalya. Gautama had to punish his p. 138 wife by converting her into a stone. This punishment, however, reacted upon Gautama inasmuch as it put a stop to his loading any longer a life of domesticity. In spite of such a dire affliction Gautama did not suffer his cheerfulness to depart from his heart. The effect of the allusion is to tell Indra that the speaker is not like him but like Gautama, _i.e._, that Namuchi was not the slave of his passions but that he was the master of his senses and the how.

[^355]: 139:1 The we here is the pronoun of dignity, applying to the speaker only and not to both the speaker and the listener.

[^356]: 140:1 The sentence is an interrogative one. The Burdwan translator mistakes the Meaning. K.P. Singha is correct.

[^357]: 144:1 These things had not happened for many days in consequence of the wickedness of the _Asuras_. With the victory of Indra. sacrifices returned. and with them universal peace.

[^358]: 145:1 The words are _Dhruvadwarabhavam_. The commentator is silent. Probably a Himalayan Pass. The vernacular translators think it is the region of the Pole-star that is intended. Dhruva is a name of Brahman the Creator. It may mean, therefore, the river as it issues out of Brahman's _loka_ or region. The Pauranic myth is that issuing from the foot of Vishnu, the stream enters the Kamandalu of Brahman and thence to the earth.

[^359]: 145:2 The reader of Lord Lytton's works may, in this connection, be reminded of the discourse between _Mejnour_ and the neophyte introduced to him by Zanoni, in course of their evening rambles over the ridges of the Appenines.

[^360]: 148:1 K.P. Singha wrongly translates this verse.

[^361]: 148:2 It is difficult to give to non-Hindu people the idea of what is _uchchhishta_. The hand becomes _uchchhishta_ when set to food that is being eaten. Without washing that hand with pure water, it is never used by a Hindu for doing any work. The food that remains in a dish after some portion of it has been eaten is _uchchhishta_. The idea is particular to Hinduism and is not to be seen among other races or peoples in the world.

[^362]: 148:3 _Yavasa_ is pasture grass.

[^363]: 148:4 _Payasa_ is a kind of pudding prepared of rice boiled in sugared milk. Krisara is milk, sesamum, and rice. _Sashkuli_ is a sort of pie, made of rice or barley boiled in sugared water.

[^364]: 149:1 No merit attaches to the act of feeding an illiterate person.

[^365]: 149:2 The correct reading is _Vyabhajat_. The Bengal reading _vyabhayat_ would imply a tautology, for the second line would then give the same meaning as the first.

[^366]: 151:1 Everything else liable to be affected by primordial nature. Only the Supreme Soul cannot be affected. Hence, _Brahma_ is often said to be “above _Prakriti_.” _Prakriti_, here, is of course used in its largest sense.

[^367]: 151:2 The second line of verse 8, and the last clause of the first line of verse 9, are wrongly rendered by both the Vernacular translators. K.P. Singha omits certain portions, while the Burdwan translator, as usual, writes nonsense. The verb is _nihnuvanti_, meaning 'conceal: _i.e._, ‘do not brag of.’ The verb _vadishyanti_ is to be repeated after _ahite hitam_. For _hitam_ _ahitam_ may be read by way of antithesis.

[^368]: 151:3 K.P. Singha mistranslates this verse.

[^369]: 153:1 The Burdwan translator misunderstands the word _anavajnata_. K.P. Singha skips over it.

[^370]: 153:2 The sense is this: though really unattached, he seems to be attached. In this there is especial merit. A man doing the duties of a householder, without, however, being attached to wife and children and possessions, is a very superior person. Such a one has been compared to a lotus leaf, which, when dipped in water, is never soaked or drenched by it. Some, seeing the difficulty of the combat, fly away. In this there is little merit. To face all objects of desire, to enjoy them, but all the while to remain so unattached to them as not to feel the slightest pang if dissociated from them, is more meritorious.

[^371]: 155:1 _Kalajnanena nishthitam_ are the words of the original. Vyasa's answer is taken up with assigning limits to the successive periods of Creation and Non-existence, or the durations of Brahman's wakeful and sleeping periods.

[^372]: 155:2 _Agre_ is explained by the commentator as _srishteh prak_.

[^373]: 156:1 The Krita extends in all for 4,800 years. The Treta for 3,600; the Dwapara for 2,400; and the Kali for 1,200. These are, however, the years of the deities. Verses 15-17 and 20-21 occur in _Manusmriti_, Chapter I.

[^374]: 156:2 This verse occurs in _Manusmriti_, corresponding with 81 of Chapter 1. The reading, however, in _Manusmriti_, is slightly different, for the last clause is _Manushyanpavartate_. In rendering verse 23, I take this reading and follow Medhatithi's gloss. If Nilakantha's gloss and the reading in both the Bengal and the Bombay texts be followed, the passage would run thus,—“No instruction or precept of that age ran along unrighteous ways, since that was the foremost of all ages.” Nilakantha explains _parah_ as _sa cha parah_. K.P. Singha skips over the difficulty and the Burdwan translator, as usual, gives an incorrect version.

[^375]: 156:3 The total comes up to 12,000 years. These constitute a _Devayuga_. At thousand _Devayugas_ compose a day of Brahman. Verse 28 occurs in _Manusmriti_, Chapter 1.

[^376]: 156:4 The reader who has gone through the previous Sections can have no difficulty in understanding: this. The external world is nothing but Mind transformed. Mind, therefore, is spoken of here as _Vyaktatmaka_ or that which is the soul of the _vyakta_ or that is manifest, or that which is the _vyakta_, or between which and the _vyakta_ there is no difference whatever. Some of the Bengal texts do not conclude Section 231 with the 32nd verse but go on and p. 157 include the whole of the 232nd Section in it. This, however, is not to be seen in the Bombay texts as also in some of the texts of Bengal that I have seen.

[^377]: 157:1 _Tejomayam_ is explained by the commentator as _Vasanamayam_ or having the principle of desire or wish within it, otherwise Creation could not take place. _Yasya_ is used for _yatah_.

[^378]: 157:2 By Mahat is meant Pure or Subtile Intelligence. The Manifest starts into existence from Mind or has Mind for its soul. Hence, as explained in previous Sections, Mind is called _Vyaktatmakam_.

[^379]: 157:3 These seven great Beings or entities are _Mahat_, the same speedily transformed into Mind, and the five elemental entities of Space, etc.

[^380]: 157:4 Verses 4, 5, 6 and 7 occur in _Manusmriti_, corresponding with the latter's 75, 76, 77 and 78 of Chapter 1.

[^381]: 158:1 _Chit_ or _Jiva_ is called _Purusha_ or resider in body, because when overlaid with Avidya by the Supreme Soul, it is not possible for it to exist in any other way than by being invested with a covering or case made of primordial matter determined by the power of acts. Here, however, it means limbs or _avayavam_.

[^382]: 158:2 What is stated in verse 10, 11 and 12 is this: the seven great entities, in their gross form, are unable, if separate, to produce anything. They, therefore, combine with one another. Thus uniting, they first form the _asrayanam_ of sarira _i.e._, the constituent parts of the body. They, at this stage, must be known by the name of _Purusha_ of _avayava_, _i.e._, mere limbs. When these limbs again unite, then _murtimat shodasatmakam sartram bhavati_, _i.e._, the full body, possessed of form and having the six and ten attributes, comes into existence. Then the subtile _Mahat_ and the subtile _bhutas_, with the unexhausted residue of acts, enter it. The plural form ‘_mahanti_’ is used because, as the commentator explains, ‘_pratipurusham mahatadinam bhinnatwapratipadanertham_,’ _i.e._, the same ‘_mahat_,’ by entering each different form apparently becomes many. Thus there are two bodies, one gross, and the other subtile called ‘_linga-sarira_.’ The residue of acts is thus explained: all creatures enjoy or suffer the effects of their good and bad acts. If, however, the consequences of acts, good and bad, be all exhausted, there can be no rebirth. A residue, therefore, remains in consequence of which rebirth becomes possible. Creation and destruction, again, are endlessly going on. The beginning of the _first_ Creation is inconceivable. The Creation here described is one of a series. This is further explained in the verses that follow.

[^383]: 158:3 The six and ten parts are the five gross _bhutas_, and the eleven senses of knowledge and action including mind. The great creatures are the _tan-mantras_ of the gross elements, _i.e._, their subtile forms. At first the gross body (with the principle of growth) is formed, into it enters the subtile body or the _linga-sarira_. At first (as already said) the gross elements come together. Then the subtile ones with the residue of acts. Then enters the Soul which is _Brahma_ itself. The Soul enters into the subtile form for witnessing, or surveying. All creatures are only manifestations of that Soul due to the accident of _Avidya_ or _Maya_. _Tapas_ means, as the commentator explains, _alochana_.

[^384]: 159:1 _i.e._, this variety of Being and this variety of relations.

[^385]: 159:2 _Anubhe_ is explained as _ubhayavyatiriktam_. _Sattwasthas_ are those that depend upon the really existent, _i.e._, those that regard _Brahma_ as the sole cause competent for the production of all effects.

[^386]: 159:3 It is exceedingly difficult to understand the true meaning of these verses. A verbal translation is not calculated to bring out the sense. Apparently, the statement that all things are contained in the Vedas is nonsense. In reality, however, what is intended to be said is that as the Vedas are Speech or Words, the Creator had to utter words symbolizing his ideas before creating anything. It is remarkable that there is a close resemblance between the spirit of the first chapter of Genesis with what is contained in the _Srutis_ on the subject of Creation. Let there be Earth, and there was Earth, says the inspired poet of Genesis. Nilakantha cites exactly similar words from the _Srutis_ as those which Brahman uttered for creating the Earth, such as, _Bhuriti vyaharau_ as _Bhumimasrijat_. Then the four modes of life with the duties of each, the modes of worship, etc., were also indicated, hence, all acts also are in the Vedas which represent the words of _Brahma_.

[^387]: 160:1 All things are _Sujata_ or well-made by him. In Genesis it is said that God uttered particular words and particular objects sprang into existence, and He saw that they were good.

[^388]: 160:2 The first line contains only technical terms. _Nama_ means _Rigveda_. Hence, it stands for study of all the Vedas. _Bheda_ stands for half, _i.e._, for the wife, who must be associated with her husband in all religious acts. _Tapah_ is penance; hence it stands for all kinds of observances like _chandrayana_, and modes of life, _vanaprastha_, etc. _Karma_ means such acts as the saying of morning and evening prayers, etc. _Yama_ is sacrifice like _jyotishtoma_ etc. _Akhya_ means such acts as lead to good fame, like the digging of tanks, the making of roads, etc. _Aloka_, meaning meditation, is of three kinds. Lastly, comes _Siddhi_, meaning that emancipation which is arrived at by one during this life. The instrumental plural _kramaih_ should be construed as _dasabhih karmaih namadibhi sahita Vedeshu prechate_. K.P. Singha has correctly rendered the verse, omitting reference to _Siddhi_. The Burdwan translator has totally misunderstood it.

[^389]: 160:3 _Gahanam_ is explained by the commentator as _duravagaham Brahma_; _vedavadeshu_ means, according to him, the rites and observances laid down in the Vedas. It is better, however, to take it literally, _i.e._, for the words of the Vedas. Vedanteshu means ‘in the Upanishads,’ which come _after_ the Vedas, Both the Vernacular translators have misunderstood this verse.

[^390]: 161:1 This verse is, no doubt, pleonastic. The commentator interprets it in the way I have rendered it. _Yathadharmam_, according to him, means ‘without transgressing acts and duties consistent with virtue’; _yathagamam_ means ‘following the authority of the scriptures’; _vikriyate_ implies ‘do from motives of advantage and gain.’ The sense seems to be that in the three other _yugas_, men, without absolutely abandoning virtue, perform good acts and Vedic sacrifices and rites and scriptural vows and observances, from motives of low gain and not as a Preparation for Emancipation. Thus even in the Kali age, Vedic rites are not absolutely unknown. The motive, however, from which these are undertaken is connected with some low or sordid gain.

[^391]: 161:2 _Samayah sthanam matam; sa eva bhutani bhavati; sa eva tan dadhati_. This is the construction, as explained by the commentator.

[^392]: 162:1 From what has been said in the previous Sections, the reader will have no difficulty in understanding what is meant by _abhivyaktatmakam manah_. It is mind that is the essence of all that is _abhivyakta_ or manifest. That mind swallows up the attribute of Space. Hence it is _avyaktam_, that swallows up the _manaso vyaktam_. This swallowing up is _Brahmah sampratisancharah_ or destruction of the outward universe in its manifest vastness. The commentator gives the substance of the verse in these words: _manahkalpito virat manasi eva liyate_. From the verses that follow it would seem that the object of this section is to describe the yogin's _pratyahara_ and not the actual dissolution of the universe.

[^393]: 163:1 Verses 16 and 17 are exceedingly difficult. The commentator has shown great learning in expounding them. Unfortunately, the subject is a _yoga_ mystery, and the explanation and illustrations of the commentator refer to things beyond the reach of ordinary experience and intelligence. The words _Chandramas_, _Kala_, and _Valam_, and _Akasa_ also and _Ghosa_ (in verse 17), are technical terms of _yoga_. I referred the passage to more than one learned Pundit. My referees are of opinion that a _yoga_ mystery is here expounded, which yogins alone can understand. European scholars will probably smile at the statement that there is a hidden meaning in these words. Most readers will take the verses for nonsense. Reflection, however, has convinced me that _yoga_ is not nonsense. One who has not studied the elements of Geometry or Algebra, cannot, however intelligent, hope to understand at once a Proposition of the Principia or the theorem of De Moivre. Failing to give the actual sense, I have contented myself with giving a verbal translation.

[^394]: 163:2 Jatakarma is the ceremony that is performed with certain Vedic _mantras_ immediately after a child's birth. There are many such ceremonies to be performed till _Samavartana_ or return from the preceptor's home after completion of the period of pupilage. These ceremonies are necessarily such that they must be performed by the child's father or somebody else whom the latter might call in.

[^395]: 163:3 In this country, no fees are charged for tuition. The pupil, however, after completing his studies, may give his preceptor a final fee which is determined by the choice of the preceptor himself and which varies according to the means of the pupil leaving the preceptor's home for his own.

[^396]: 164:1 By begetting children, one pays off one's debt to ancestors; by studying the Vedas, one pays off one's debt to the _Rishis_; and by performing sacrifices one pays off one's debt to the deities.

[^397]: 164:2 It is a deadly sin to take anything from the father-in-law or other relatives (by marriage) of a daughter. What is got from such sources is, to this day, spent freely. Those persons that sell their daughters in marriage are universally reckoned as fallen.

[^398]: 164:3 The fact is, the duty of the householder obliges him to worship the deities and the _Pitris_, and to become hospitable to the others named. The Brahmana, however, has no ostensible means for discharging this duty. The only means open to him is acceptance of gifts. In this case, acceptance, therefore, for such ends is not productive of demerit.

[^399]: 164:4 _Kritadapi_ is explained by the commentator as _pakvannadapi_.

[^400]: 164:5 The sense is that there is no gift which is too valuable for such persons.

[^401]: 166:1 The first and the fourth verses are triplets in the Bengal texts.

[^402]: 166:2 These are, of course, religious acts.

[^403]: 167:1 In the Bengal texts verse 12 consists of on, line. This, I think, is correct. Verses 13, 14, 15, and 16 form one sentence. Verse 12 is complete by itself. The _udaka_ in _kalodaka_ should be taken as meaning stream or river otherwise _ahoratrajalena_ would be pleonastic. Again _arthakamajalena_, to avoid, redundancy, should be taken as implying the springs that supply the water. _Vihinsa-taruvahina_ is, ‘having benevolence for the trees that float on its water.’ This idea is beautiful. Creatures that are being home away in, the stream of Time may catch these trees of benevolence for saving themselves. The Burdwan translator misunderstands _vihinsa_ and makes nonsense of the idea. Altogether, though highly ornate, the metaphors are original. Of course, the idea is eminently oriental. Eastern rhetoric being fond of spinning out metaphors and similes, which, in the hands of Eastern poets, become highly elastic.

[^404]: 167:2 K.P. Singha misunderstands this verse. The Burdwan translator is also inaccurate.

[^405]: 168:1 The place should be a level spot, not impure (such as a crematorium, etc.), free from _kankars_, fire, and sand, etc.; solitary and free from noise and other sources of disturbance. Acts include abstention from food and sports and amusements, abstention from all kinds of work having only worldly objects to accomplish, abstention also from sleep and dreams. Affection means that for good disciples or for progress in yoga. Objects refer to sacred fuel, water, and suppression of expectancy and anxiety, etc. Means refer to the seat to be used, the manner of sitting, and the attitude of the body. Destruction refers to the conquest of desire and attachments, _i.e._, renunciation of all attractive things. Certainty means the p. 169 unalterable belief that what is said about yoga in the Vedas and by preceptors is true. The nom. sing. inflection stands for the instrumental plural. Eyes include the other senses. All these should be restrained. Food means pure food. Suppression refers to the subjugation of our natural inclination towards earthly objects. Mind here has reference to the regulation of the will and its reverse, _viz_., irresolution. Survey means reflection on birth, death, decrepitude, disease, sorrow, faults, etc. In giving these meanings, I, of course, follow Nilakantha.

[^406]: 169:1 Notwithstanding Nilakantha's gloss which shows great ingenuity and which has been apparently followed by both of them, the Vernacular translators have misunderstood Portions of these verses which sketch out the course of life which one desirous of attaining to Emancipation or Brahma is to follow. Particular virtues or attributes have been represented as particular limbs of the car. It does not appear that there is (except in one or two instances), any especial aptitude in any of those virtues or attributes for corresponding with One instead of with another limb of the figurative car. _Upastha_ is that part of the car on which the driver sits. _Varutha_ is the wooden fence round a car for protecting it against the effects of collision. Shame is the feeling that withdraws us from all wicked acts. _Kuvara_ is the pole to which the yoke is attached. Upaya and Apaya, which have been called the _kuvara_, are ‘means’ and destruction'—explained in verse above. _Aksha_ is the wheel. _Yuga_ is the yoke. _Vandhura_ is that part of yuga where it is attached to the pole, _i.e._, its Middle, about which appears something like a projecting knob. _Nemi_ is the circumference of the wheel. _Nabhi_ is the central portion of the car upon which the rider or warrior is seated. _Pratoda_ is the goad with which the driver urges, the steeds. The commentator explains that _jiva-yuktah_ means having such a _jiva_ as is desirous of attaining to Emancipation or _Moksha_. Such elaborate figures are favourite conceits of Oriental poets.

[^407]: 170:1 Adopting the Kantian distribution of the mental phenomena, _viz_., the three great divisions of Cognitive faculties, Pleasure and Pain, and Desire and Will, Sir William Hamilton subdivides the first (_viz_., the Cognitive faculties), into the acquisitive faculty, the retentive faculty, the reproductive faculty, the representative faculty, and reason or judgment by which concepts are compared together. _Dharana_ corresponds with the exercise of the Representative faculty or the power by which the mind is held to or kept employed upon a particular image or notion. It is this faculty that is especially trained by _yogins_. Indeed, the initial stop consists in training it to the desirable extent.

[^408]: 170:2 The seven kinds of _Dharanas_ appertain respectively to Earth, Wind, Space, Water, Fire, Consciousness and Understanding.

[^409]: 170:3 All these have been explained lower down.

[^410]: 170:4 The construction of both these lines is difficult to understand. The prose order of the line is ‘_yogatah yuktesu_ (madhye) _yasya yatha_, etc., _vikrama_ (tatha vakshyami); _atmani pasyatah_ (janasya) _yuktasya yogasya_ (yatha) _siddhi_ (tatha vakshyami).’ _Yogatah_ means _upayatah_, _i.e._, according to rules and ordinances. _Vikrama_ is used in a peculiar sense, _viz_., _anubhavakramah_, _i.e._, the order of conception or conceptions in other order _Atmani pasyatah_ means ‘of him who looks into himself,’ _i.e._, who withdraws his mind from the outer world and turns it to view his own self. Without Nilakantha's aid, such verses would be thoroughly unintelligible.

[^411]: 170:5 _Pasyatah_ means ‘of that which sees,’ _i.e._, of the Atman or Soul.

[^412]: 171:1 The Understanding is called the _soul_ of the five elements and of the consciousness of individuality because these six things rest on it or have it for their refuge. The reader will easily understand this from what has been said in the previous Sections.

[^413]: 171:2 It is from the Unmanifest or the Supreme Soul that the world or all that is Manifest, springs or emanates. The Yogin, in consequence of his superior knowledge, apprehends all that is Manifest to be but the Unmanifest Supreme Soul.

[^414]: 172:1 _Na kritina_, _i.e._, _kriti eva_. ‘Nirakriti’ is regardless of dress and appearance. K.P. Singha wrongly translates both these words.

[^415]: 172:2 _i.e._, who has neither friend nor foe. This means that he regards all creatures with an equal eye, showing particular favour to none, and having no dislike for any. Coldness of heart is not implied, but impartial and equal benevolence for all. Taking praise and blame equally, _i.e._, never rejoicing at praise nor grieving at blame.

[^416]: 172:3 It is said that with the practice of Yoga, during the first stages, certain extraordinary powers come to the Yogin whether he wishes for them or not. In a previous Section it has been said that that Yogin who suffers himself to be led away by these extraordinary acquisitions, goes to hell, _i.e._, fails to attain to Emancipation beside which heaven itself with the status of Indra is only hell. Hence, he who transcends the puissance that Yoga brings about becomes Emancipate.

[^417]: 172:4 _Dhirah_ is explained as _dhyanavan_. Santi has reference to Emancipation, for it is Emancipation alone that can give tranquillity or final rest. The commentator points out that in this verse the speaker shows a decided preference for the Sankhya philosophy.

[^418]: 172:5 _Vide_ _Gita_, verses 4 and 5, Chapter V.

[^419]: 172:6 _Brahmanam_ is _arsha_ for _Brahmam_.

[^420]: 173:1 I follow Nilakantha's gloss in rendering the words _Vidya_, _Pravritti_ and _Nivritti_, as used in this verse. By the first, the commentator thinks, is meant that course of instruction in consequence of which error may be dispelled and truth acquired. The usual illustration of the cord and the snake is given. The former maybe mistaken for the latter, but when the mistake ceases, correct apprehension follows. Pravritti has been sufficiently indicated in the text in which the words of the gloss has been incorporated. By Nivritti is meant the doctrine of the Sunyavadins and Lokayatikas (evidently the Buddhists) who seek annihilation or extinction as the only true Emancipation. Both the Vernacular translators are wrong. The Burdwan translator, as usual, citing the very words of the gloss, misunderstands them completely.

[^421]: 173:2 The construction of the first line is ‘_yastu achetanah bhavam vina swabhavena_ (sarvam bhati iti) _pasyan_, etc., etc., _pushyate_ (sa na kinchana labhate).’ Bhavan is explained as ‘adhishthanasattam.’ The commentator is of opinion that the speaker refers in this verse to the Sunyavadins.

[^422]: 173:3 The Bombay text reads _Putwatrinamishikamva_.

[^423]: 173:4 _Enam_ is singular. The commentator thinks it should be taken distributively. In verse 3, the doctrine of the Nihilists (Sunyavadins) has been referred to. In verse 4, that of the Lokayatikas. In both, Nature is spoken of as the cause, with this difference that the former regard the universe to be only an erroneous impression of an existent entity, while the latter regard it as a real entity flowing from and manifesting itself under its own nature. Both doctrines, the speaker says, are false.

[^424]: 173:5 Both the Vernacular translators skip over the word _paribhava_ in the second line of verse p. 174 6. The commentator correctly explains that _swabhava_ in 6 means _swasyaiva bhavah sattakaranam iti, ekah pakshah_. _Paribhava_, he explains is _paritah swasya itaresham bhavah_. The first refers to the Nihilists, the second to the Lokayatikas or to verses 3 and 4 respectively.

[^425]: 174:1 It is by the wisdom that all these results are achieved. Wisdom is the application of means for the accomplishment of ends. Nature, never rears palaces or produces vehicles and the diverse other comforts that man enjoys. He that would rely upon Nature for these would never obtain them however long he might wait. The need for exertion, both mental and physical, and the success which crowns that exertion furnish the best answer, the speaker thinks, to both the Nihilist sand the Lokayatikas. The word _tulyalakshanah_ is skipped over by both the Bengali translators.

[^426]: 174:2 By _para_ is meant the _Chit_ or Soul, by _avara_, all else, _i.e._, non-ego or matter. The words _Prajna_, _Jnana_, and _Vidya_ are all as used here, equivalent. The second line of this verse is wrongly rendered by both the Bengali translators, the Burdwan translator, as usual, not understanding the words of the gloss he quotes.

[^427]: 174:3 It is difficult to render the word _cheshta_ as used here. Ordinarily it implies effort or action. It is plain, however, that here it stands for intelligent energy, implying both mental and physical effort or action, for its function is to distinguish or differentiate.

[^428]: 174:4 The _itarani_ do not refer to _Pisachas_ as rendered by K.P. Singha, but to birds which are called _Khechare_ or denizens of the sky or air. Khechara may include Pisachas, but these are also _Bhuchara_ or denizens of the surface of the earth.

[^429]: 174:5 The commentator explains that for ascertaining who are _uttama_ or foremost, the middling, p. 175 or intermediate ones are first spoken of and their distinctions mentioned in the following verses. Of course, the foremost are foremost, and the intermediate ones can never be superior to them. For all that, intermediate ones are observers of the duties of caste; the foremost ones are not so, they having transcended such distinctions; hence, tentatively, the ignorant or popular opinion is first taken, to the effect that the observers of caste are superior to those who do not observe _Jatidharma_.

[^430]: 175:1 This probably means that as the Vedas had not been reduced to writing, their contents rested or dwelt in memories of men versed in them.

[^431]: 175:2 To understand what is birth and what is death, and to avoid birth (add, therefore, death), are the highest fruits of knowledge of the Soul. Those that have no knowledge of the Soul have to travel in a round of repeated rebirths.

[^432]: 175:3 _i.e._, of power that comes of Yoga.

[^433]: 175:4 The word _para_ (the locative form of which is used here) always means that which is high or foremost. It is frequently employed to mean either _Brahma_ or the Soul, and as Soul is regarded to be apart of _Brahma_, _para_ has but one and the same meaning. The Burdwan translator takes it for ‘Scriptures other than the Vedas.’ K.P. Singha skips over it. Of course, _savda-Brahma_ stands for the Vedas.

[^434]: 175:5 To look upon everything in the universe as one's own. Soul is the highest aspiration of a righteous person. It is _yoga_ that enables one to attain to this highest ideal of existence. One who realises this is said to be a true Brahmana, a really regenerate person, in fact, a god on Earth. _Adhiyajna_ and _Adhidaivata_ are words that signify the Soul.

[^435]: 175:6 What the distinction is between _anta_ and _nidhan_ is not obvious. The commentator is p. 176 silent. K.P. Singha translates the verse correctly. The Burdwan translator makes utter nonsense of the words in the second line.

[^436]: 176:1 Whether _karma_ is _swabhava_ or _jnanam_ means (as the commentator explains) whether it is obligatory or optional. _Jnanam_, of course, means here _jnana-janakam_, _i.e._, leading to knowledge. Knowledge is essential to success or emancipation. If acts become necessary for leading to knowledge, the doubt may then arise that they cease to be obligatory, for knowledge may be supposed to be attainable otherwise than by acts. K.P. Singha translates this verse correctly, the Burdwan translator incorrectly, and, as usual, misunderstands the gloss completely.

[^437]: 176:2 The first line of this verse is exceedingly terse. The construction, as explained by the commentator, is _Tatra_ (samsaye) _purusham prati Jnanam_ (jnanajanakam) _chet_ (karma) _syat_, (tarhi) _sa_ (eva) _Vedavidhih_. One cannot help admiring Nilakantha for his patience and ingenuity.

[^438]: 176:3 _Daiva_ is explained by the commentator as _Grahah_ or _Kalah_. I think, it is used to signify some kind of blind force whose origin is untraceable. Hence, I render it necessity. _Vritti_ in verse 5 is evidently Exertion, for the word implies course, of conduct, _Avivekam_ is _samuchchayam_ or a combination of all the three.

[^439]: 176:4 Inspired with doubt,' with reference to the declarations of the _Srutis_. ‘Possessed of p. 177 tranquil souls,’ _i.e._, not penetrated by doubts of any kind.

[^440]: 177:1 In the Treta and the other Yugas people are seen professing attachment or devotion to one only of the Vedas and not to the others, be it the Richs, the Samans, or the Yajuses. The speaker, dissatisfied with this refers to the Krita age as one in which such difference of faith were not observable. The men of that age regarded all the Vedas equally, and, in fact, as even identical.

[^441]: 177:2 _Jiva_ or _Chit_ becomes puissant and succeeds in creating the universe by means of penance. By penance one attains to _Brahma_, and, therefore, universal puissance. This has been sufficiently explained in the previous Sections.

[^442]: 177:3 This is one of the most important verses in this section, for, as the commentator explains, this furnishes the answer to the question proposed in the previous section, _viz_., ‘what is that knowledge?’ In the Vedas both acts and knowledge have been spoken of. In the province of acts, _Brahma_ has been represented as Indra and the other gods. _Brahma_, therefore, as spoken of there, is ‘_gahana_’, or hidden to (or inconceivable by) even those that are conversant with that province or sphere of the Vedas. In the Vedanta, again, knowledge or _Vidya_ has been spoken of as the means by which to attain to _Brahma_. The knowledge or _Vidya_, therefore, which is the subject of the question, is not what is implied by _Pravritti dharma_ or by _Nivritti_ as used in the previous section.

[^443]: 177:4 The second line of this verse corresponds with the second line of verse 87 of Chapter II of _Manusmriti_.

[^444]: 177:5 They are seen and not seen is an idiomatic expression for ‘becoming invisible.’

[^445]: 177:6 _i.e._, kine do not yield copious and sweet milk; the soil ceases to be fertile; water ceases p. 178 to be sweet; and the medicinal and edible herbs lose their virtues of healing as also their flavour.

[^446]: 178:1 The commentator thinks that _Swadharmasthah_ is connected with _asramah_ in the first line. I prefer the more obvious construction.

[^447]: 178:2 _Varshati_ means _pushnati_. _Angani_ means the observances necessary for the practice of Yoga as also all kinds of rites and vows. The Vedas cause these to grow, and they, in their turn, aid all students of the Vedas in achieving their purposes.

[^448]: 178:3 _Prabhavah_ is _uttpattih_, or origin; _sthanam_ is _poshanam_. Both the Vernacular translators skip over the last word, thinking that _prabhavasthanam_, is one word. The commentator notices them as separate. In the beginning of the second line, _yatra_ is understood, _Swabhavena_, is explained by the commentator as _Brahmabhavena, natu vikritena rupena_. I think the explanation is correct, and have adopted it accordingly in the text.

[^449]: 178:4 _Yatha_ in the first line of verse means, as the commentator explains, _yat prakarakam_.

[^450]: 179:1 The commentator points out that by these four words the four modes of life are indicated.

[^451]: 179:2 The commentator explains that this means that amongst embodied creatures they that are ignorant take those great entities which are really non-ego for either the ego or its Possessions.

[^452]: 179:3 The commentator explains that the object of this verse is to show that the Yoga view of the Soul being only the enjoyer but not the actor, is not correct. On the other hand, the Sankhya view of the Soul being neither the enjoyer nor the actor, is true. The deities, remaining in the several senses, act and enjoy. It is through ignorance that the Soul ascribes to itself their enjoyments and their actions.

[^453]: 179:4 I render _Bhutatma_ by knowledge, following the commentator who uses the words _buddhyupadhirjivah_ for explaining it.

[^454]: 179:5 _Niyama_ and _Visarga_ are explained by the commentator as ‘destruction’ and ‘creation.’ I prefer to take them as meaning ‘guiding or restraining,’ and ‘employing.’ Practically, the explanations are identical.

[^455]: 179:6 What is meant by the objects of the senses residing within the bodies of living creatures p. 180 is that (as the commentator explains) their concepts exist in ‘the cavity of the heart’ (probably, mind) so that when necessary or called for, they appear (before the mind's eye). _Swabhava_ is explained as ‘attributes’ like heat and cold, etc.

[^456]: 180:1 This is a very difficult verse. I have rendered it, following Nilakantha's gloss. In verse the speaker lays down what entities dwell in the body. In the rest he expounds the nature of Sattwa which the commentator takes to mean _buddhi_ or knowledge. He begins with the statement that _Sattwasya asrayah nasti_. This does not mean that the knowledge has no refuge, for that would be absurd, but it means that the _asraya_ of the knowledge, _i.e._, that in which the knowledge dwells, _viz_., the body, does not exist, the true doctrine being that the body has no real existence but that it exists like to its image in a dream. The body being non-existent, what then is the real refuge of the knowledge? The speaker answers it by saying _Gunah_, implying that primeval _Prakriti_ characterised by the three attributes is that real refuge. Then it is said that _Chetana_ (by which is implied the Soul here) is not the refuge of the knowledge for the Soul is dissociated from everything and incapable of transformation of any kind. The question is then mentally started,—May not the Gunas be the qualities of the knowledge (instead of being, as said above, its refuge)? For dispelling this doubt, it is stated that Sattwa is the product of _Tejas_ (Desire). The Gunas are _not_ the product of Tejas. Hence the Gunas, which have a different origin cannot be the properties of _Sattwa_. The Gunas exist independently of Desire. Thus the knowledge, which has Desire for its originating cause, rests on the Gunas or has them for its refuge. In this verse, therefore, the nature of the body, the knowledge, and the Gunas, is expounded. The grammatical construction of the first line is exceedingly terse.

[^457]: 180:2 Such men behold _Brahma_ in all things. _Abhijanah_ is explained by the commentator as _sishyakuladih_. This seems to be the true meaning of the word here.

[^458]: 180:3 In rendering this word _tatam_ (where it occurs in the _Gita_), it has been shown that to take it as equivalent to ‘spread’ is incorrect. In such connections, it is evident that it means 'pervaded!

[^459]: 180:4 If I have understood the gloss aright, this is what the first line of 21 means. _Vedatma_ is explained as Vedic sound, _i.e._, the instructions inculcated in the Vedas. The word _atma_ p. 181 in the second clause means simply oneself or a person or individual. The sense then is this. The Vedas teach that all is one's soul. The extent to which one succeeds in realising this is the measure of one's attainment of _Brahma_. If one can realise it fully, one attains to _Brahma_ fully. If partially, one's attainment of _Brahma_ also is partial.

[^460]: 181:1 The track of such a person, it is said, is as invisible as the skies. The commentator explains that the very gods become stupefied in respect of the object which such a man seeks, the object, of course, being _Brahma_.

[^461]: 181:2 That, of course, in which Time is cooked, is _Brahma_.

[^462]: 181:3 By this the speaker says that _Brahma_ is not to be found in any particular spot however holy.

[^463]: 181:4 Because _Brahma_ is infinite.

[^464]: 181:5 ‘_Niyatah_’ is explained by the commentator as _achanchalah_, and _vasi_ as without the fault of _upadhi_. ‘_Hansati_, _i.e._, _gachechati ite_,’ hence _gatimati_.

[^465]: 181:6 The sense is that the Soul residing within the body is identical with the Supreme Soul, and men of wisdom only know it.

[^466]: 181:7 The construction is _Hansoktancha yat aksharam tat_ (eva) _kutastham aksharam_, meaning that there is no difference between Jivatman and Paramatman. Both are identical.

[^467]: 182 :1 Sattwena is explained as ‘by intelligence or the knowledge.’

[^468]: 182 :2 The construction, as explained by the commentator, is _Brahma tejomayam sukram; yasya sukrasya sarvam idam tasyapi Brahma rasah_. The last word means _sarah_.

[^469]: 182 :3 Both the Vernacular translators have skipped over this line. The meaning is this: Brahma opened his eyes for becoming many, as the _Srutis_ declare, and thereupon he became many. This, as the commentator explains, _Ikshana-kartritvena sarvatmakatwam gatam_, or by a glance Brahma became the Soul of all things mobile and immobile.

[^470]: 182 :4 The commentator explains that _Brahmanah padam_ means _prakritim_. He thinks, therefore, p. 183that the last clause of the second line means ‘should seek to subdue _prakriti_ which is the _layasthanam_ of _mahattattwa_.’ I prefer the obvious sense of the words.

[^471]: 183:1 _Parimitam Kalam_ is explained by the commentator as equivalent to six months as the _srutis_ declare.

[^472]: 183:2 These two verses set forth the Yoga ideal. By the practice of Yoga all these are capable of being acquired or attained. But then the Yogin who suffers himself to be led away by those valuable possessions is said to fall in hell, for the enjoyment of this kind is nothing but hell compared to the high object for which Yogins should strive. Pramoha, Brahma, and Avarta, are technical terms. Equality with the wind means speed of motion, power to disappear at will, and capacity to move through the skies.

[^473]: 183:3 A _chaitya_ is a sacred or a large tree which stands firm on its roots and about which all round a platform of earth is raised. _Vrikshagra_ means ‘in the front of a tree,’ probably implying ‘under the shade of its spreading branches.’

[^474]: 184:1 The commentator explains that he should imitate the wind by becoming _asangah_, _i.e._, unattached to all things. _Aniketah_ means without a house or fixed abode.

[^475]: 184:2 It is difficult to understand what is meant by _Savda-Brahmativartate_. I follow the commentator. ‘Brahma as represented by sound, is, of course, _Pranavah_ or _Om_, the mystic monosyllable standing for the trinity.’ K.P. Singha, taking _Savda-Brahma_ for an accusative, regards it as implying,—‘such a man transcends all Vedic rites.’ This is precisely the meaning attached to it by the commentator where it occurs in verse 7 of section 236 _ante_.

[^476]: 184:3 The inferior order here referred to is, of course, the Sudra order. The commentator points out that whereas only the three superior orders axe regarded to be eligible for the study of Sankhya and for inculcation of such _Srutis_ as Tattwamasi (That thou art), here Vyasa lays down that as regards the Yoga path, _all_ are eligible to betake themselves to it.

[^477]: 184:4 ‘Fixed senses,’ _i.e._, when the senses are fixed on the mind and the mind on the understanding. _Ajaram_ is immutable or unchanging, or that in which there is no change for the worse (or for the better). By subtility is indicated the incapacity of being apprehended, and by _mahattaram_ is meant infinity.

[^478]: 185:1 The _anu anudrisya_ is explained as _Guruvachanamanu_. Thus seems to be the true meaning, otherwise _avekshya_ would be pleonastic, _abhutagatim_ is _bhutasamplavaparyantam_, _i.e._, till the destruction of all beings. _Imam_ is _sastraprasiddham_.

[^479]: 185:2 The Vedas proclaim the efficacy of both acts and knowledge. Acts are not laid down for those that have knowledge.

[^480]: 185:3 _Subhashita_ is explained by the commentator as _ayam tu paramo dharma yat yogena atmadarsanam_.

[^481]: 186:1 _Na vartate_ does not mean annihilated but, as the commentator explains, _aham asmi iti na jana atmanam_.

[^482]: 186:2 _Manasena karmana_ is explained by the commentator as _sankalpena_.

[^483]: 186:3 The meaning is this: the man of acts is like the new-born moon, _i.e._, subject to growth and decay.

[^484]: 186:4 This has been explained in a previous section.

[^485]: 186:5 The soul resides in the body without partaking of any of the attributes of the body. It is, therefore, likened to a drop of water on a lotus leaf, which, though on the leaf, is not yet attached to it, in so much that it may go off without at all soaking or drenching any part of the leaf. _Yogajitatmakam_ is _yogena jito niruddha atma chittam yena tam_, as explained by the commentator.

[^486]: 186:6 Literally, ‘_Tamas_ and _Rajas_ and _Sattwa_ have the attribute of Jiva for their essence.’ The particular attribute of Jiva here referred to is the _Jnanamaya kosha_. _Jiva_, again, is all p. 187 accident of the Soul. The Soul comes from the Supreme Soul. Thus the chain of existence is traced to the Supreme Soul. In verse 20 again it is said that the body, which by itself is inanimate, when it exists with the Soul, is an accident of Jiva as uninvested with attributes.

[^487]: 187:1 I follow Nilakantha substantially in his interpretation of this verse. Two kinds of creation are here referred to as those of which Vyasa has spoken in the previous Sections. The first is _Ksharat prabhriti yah sargah_, meaning that creation which consists of the four and twenty entities commencing with _Kshara_ or _Prakriti_. The other creation, consisting of the senses with their objects, represents _buddhaiswarya_ or the puissance of the _buddhi_, these being all _buddhikalpitah_. This second creation is also _atisargah_ which means, according to the commentator, _utkrishtah_ and which is also _pradhanah_ or foremost, the reason being _bandhakatwam_ or its power to bind all individuals. I take _atisargah_ to mean ‘derivative creation,’ the second kind of creation being derived from or based upon the other, or (as I have put it in the text) transcends or overlies the other.

[^488]: 187:2 It is explained in previous sections how the course of righteousness is regulated by the character of the particular Yuga that sets in.

[^489]: 187:3 Vyasa has already explained the character of the two apparently hostile declarations. The meaning of Suka's question, therefore, is that if two declarations are only apparently hostile,—if, as explained in the _Gita_, they are identical,—how is that identity to be clearly ascertained? The fact is, Suka wishes his sire to explain the topic more clearly.

[^490]: 187:4 The course of conduct of human beings,' _i.e._, the distinctions between right and wrong. _Vimuktatma_ is taken by the commentator to imply _tyaktadehah_. The second line may also mean ‘having cast off (by _Yoga_) the consciousness of body, I shall behold my own Soul.’

[^491]: 187:5 I do not follow the commentator in his interpretation of this line.

[^492]: 187:6 ‘When the huts become smokeless,’ _i.e._, when the cooking and the eating of the inmates are over. ‘When the sound of the husking rod is hushed,’ _i.e._, when the pestle for cleaning p. 189 rice no longer works, and consequently when the inmates are not likely to be able to give much to the mendicant.

[^493]: 188:1 There is an apparent conflict between the two declarations. If both are authoritative, they cannot be regarded to be scriptural declarations in consequence of their conflict.. if one is so and the other not so, the scriptural character of the latter at least is lost. The scriptures cannot but be certain and free from fault. How then (the question proceeds) is the scriptural character of both to be maintained?

[^494]: 188:2 The Burdwan translator makes a ridiculous blunder in rendering _Jaghanyasayi_, which he takes to mean ‘sleeping on a wretched bed.’ _Jaghanya_ implies, here as elsewhere, subsequence in point of time.

[^495]: 188:3 Both the Vernacular translators have misunderstood the last part of the second line., It does not mean that the disciple should approach the preceptor when summoned, implying that he should be prompt to answer the summons, but that he should not disturb his Preceptor by clamouring for lessons or instruction. He should go to his preceptor for taking lessons only when his preceptor summons him for it.

[^496]: 189:1 Meaning, he should cast submissive or humble glances instead of staring boldly or rudely.

[^497]: 189:2 Learning was never sold in this country in ancient times. The final fee is not a return for the services of the preceptor but a token of gratitude from the pupil. Its value depended upon the ability of the disciple, though there are stories in the scriptures of disciples coming to grief on account of their persistent forwardness in pressing the acceptance of this fee. _Vide_ the story of Galava in the Udyoga Parva.

[^498]: 190:1 The fourth kind of conduct, called _kapoti_ is also called _unchha_. It consists of collecting such seeds of grain as have fallen down from the ears and as have been abandoned by the reapers.

[^499]: 190:2 Thus the second is more meritorious than the first, the third than the second, and the fourth than the third. The fourth or last, therefore, is the first in point of merit.

[^500]: 190:3 It is said that the householder who cooks must give a share of the cooked food to a _Brahmacharin_ or _Yati_ or any one who comes as a guest. If he does not do it but eats the whole of what has been cooked, he is regarded as eating what belongs to a Brahmana. This, of course, is a high sin.

[^501]: 191:1 The commentator supposes that these relatives and kinsmen are named because of the great likelihood there is of disputes arising with them on account of shares of inheritance.

[^502]: 191:2 The sense is this: these various persons, if duly reverenced by the householder, are able to send the latter to the places indicated or make him comfortable in those places.

[^503]: 191:3 _Vide_ verses 2 and 3 of this Section. Of the four courses, the first or _Kusaladhanya_, is left out here. The three others, of course, are the _Kumbhadhanya_, the _Aswastana_ (otherwise called _Unchhasila_), and the _Kapoti_. The Burdwan translator makes a blunder in enumerating the three kinds of domesticity here referred to.

[^504]: 192:1 The Burdwan version of this verse is incorrect.

[^505]: 193:1 The cow is a sacred animal and there is merit in feeding and properly tending a cow. Forest recluses kept kine for merit as also for _homa_ or sacrifice with the ghee obtained from them. The story of Vasishtha's cow is well-known.

[^506]: 193:2 These five are _Agnihotra_, _Darsapurnamasi_, _Chaturmasya_, _Pasu_ sacrifice and _Soma_ sacrifice.

[^507]: 193:3 The Burdwan translator misunderstands the words _abhravakasah_. It is a well-known word occurring in almost every lexicon. Wilson explains it correctly.

[^508]: 193:4 _i.e._, They do not use a regular husking or cleaning apparatus for cleaning the grain they use as food.

[^509]: 193:5 So that very small portion of the grain comes out for drink or mixes with the water.

[^510]: 194:1 _i.e._, who had no fixed residence and who never sought with any effort for the necessaries of life. The Burdwan translator takes both _yathavasah_ and _akritacramah_ for two independent names of _Rishis_ instead of taking them as adjectives of _Sudivatandi_.

[^511]: 194:2 _i.e._, whose wishes were immediately crowned with success, in respect of both blessings and curses, etc.

[^512]: 194:3 _Niranandah_ is explained as _krichcchrachandrayanadiparatwat_.

[^513]: 194:4 _Anakstrah_ is explained by the commentator as ‘different from stars and planets but still freed from darkness’ and, therefore, effulgent or luminous. _Anadhrishyah_ is fearless.

[^514]: 194:5 _Atmayaji_ is explained as one who performs his own _sraddha_ or obsequial rites. The Sandhi in the next word is _arsha_; _atmakrida_ is one who does not take pleasure in wife or children but whose source of pleasure is his own self: Similarly, _atmasraya_ is one who without depending upon kings or others takes refuge in himself.

[^515]: 194:6 Such sacrifice, for example, as those called _Brahma-yajna_, etc.

[^516]: 195:1 _Yajinam yajna_ is the sacrifice of ordinary sacrifices, _i.e._, the usual sacrifices consisting of tangible offerings unto the deities, and performed with the aid of Vedic _mantras_. The ablative implies cause. _Atmani ijya_ is sacrifice in Self, _i.e._, _Yoga_. The meaning of the first line, therefore, is when through performance of ordinary sacrifices and rites, the mind becomes pure and the sacrificer is enabled to practise yoga. Unto the three fires he should duly sacrifice on his own self. means, of course, that without any longer adoring his fires by visible rites and actual recitation of _mantras_, he should, for the sake of emancipation, worship in his own self or seek the extinction of mind and knowledge in _Yoga_.

[^517]: 195:2 To this day every orthodox Brahmana or Kshatriya or Vaisya never eats without offering at the outset five small mouthfuls unto the five vital breaths, _i.e._, _Prana_, _Apana_, _Samana_, _Udana_, and _Vyana_.

[^518]: 195:3 _Vapya_ or _Vapayitwa_ means causing or obtaining a shave. The Burdwan translator makes a blunder by supposing it to mean _parivyapta_. The Sannyasa mode of life, as well-known, can never be entered without a previous shave. K.P. Singha gives the correct version.

[^519]: 195:4 It is difficult to render the word _abhaya_ into English. ‘To give _abhaya_ to all creatures’ is to pledge oneself to a life of total harmlessness, or to practise universal compassion or benevolence. Abstention from every kind of injury is the great duty of the fourth mode of life.

[^520]: 195:5 The duties included in _yama_ (as explained by the commentator) are universal benevolence, truthfulness, faith, Brahmacharya, and freedom from attachment. Those that are included in _niyama_ are purity (of body and mind), contentment, study of the Vedas, meditation on the Supreme, etc. _Swasastra sutra_ means the sutras of his own _sastras_\—_i.e._, the duties laid down in respect of that Sannyasa which he has adopted; the chief of which is enquiry after the Soul or Self: _Bhutimanta_ implies Vedic recitation and the sacred thread. He who has taken to Sannyasa should display energy in these, _i.e._, persistently enquire after the Soul and throw away all caste-marks, and other indications. ‘The desirable end’ is of course, gradual Emancipation of that obtained at once. Following the commentator, K.P. Singha gives the correct version. The Burdwan version, containing the very words of the gloss, is based upon a complete misconception of their meaning.

[^521]: 196:1 The commentator correctly explains that by the first line of this verse, Vyasa answers his son's question. The two modes referred to are the first and the second, and not the second and the third as K.P. Singha in his vernacular version wrongly states. Having answered the question, the speaker (in the second line) proceeds to indicate the simple or straight path for reaching the highest object of men's endeavour, _viz_., _Paramartham_ or _Brahma_.

[^522]: 196:2 _Bhava-samahitah_ is explained as _chitta-samadhanavan_.

[^523]: 196:3 The skull is to be used as a drinking vessel. _Kuchela_, which I render ‘rags’, is supposed by the commentator to signify reddish or brown cloth which has, from age, lost its colour.

[^524]: 197:1 Elephants, when hurled into a well, become utterly helpless and unable to come out. That person, therefore, into whom words enter like elephants into a well, is he who answers not the evil speeches of others. What is said here is that only a person of such forbearance should betake himself to mendicancy or Sannyasa.

[^525]: 197:2 I have given a closely literal version of this verse. The commentator explains that first fine refers to the person who deems himself to be everything and everything to be himself. The second line refers to the same individual who, by Yoga, can withdraw his senses and the mind and consequently make the most populous place appear as totally solitary or unoccupied. This is the Yoga process called _Pratyahara_ and is described in section 233 ante. The Burdwan translator gives an incorrect version. K.P. Singha follows the commentator.

[^526]: 197:3 _Suhitya_, whence _sauhitya_, means no satiety but the full measure of gratification from eating. The speaker wishes to lay down that a mendicant or renouncer should never take food to the full measure of gratification. He should eat without completely appeasing his hunger.

[^527]: 197:4 I follow the commentator in his exposition of _kaunjara_ which he derives as _kun_ (earth or the body which is made of earth) _jaravati iti kunjarah_, _i.e._, a Yogin in Samadhi. The sense seems to be that the fruits of Yoga include or absorb the fruits of every other act. The rank and status of Indra himself is absorbed within what is attained to by Yoga. There is no kind of felicity that is not engulfed in the felicity of Emancipation, which Yoga alone can confer.

[^528]: 198:1 The commentator thinks that by the ‘one duty of abstention from injury’ is implied the fourth mode of life or Sannyasa. What is said, therefore, is that the observance of the single duty of harmlessness includes that of every other duty; or, what amounts to the same thing, the fourth mode of life is singly capable of giving merit which all the others may give together.

[^529]: 198:2 _Haryartham_ means ‘for the sake of Hari.’ _i.e._, one who takes away merit, implying a disciple or attendant. Some texts read _Ratyrtham_, meaning ‘for the happiness (of others).’

[^530]: 198:3 Because all acts are fraught with injury to others. Whether ‘acts’ betaken in its general sense or in the particular sense of ‘religious acts,’ their character is such.

[^531]: 198:4 Both the vernacular translators have completely misunderstood the second line of this Verse. The commentator correctly explains that _Tikshnam tanum_ means the religion of injury, _i.e._, the religion of sacrifices and acts. ‘So’ for ‘sa’ is _arsha_; as also _anantyam_ for _anantyam_ which, of course, implies _moksham_ or Emancipation. The commentator correctly supplies _yatah_ after _apnoti_ and shows that _prajabhyah_ is equivalent to _prajanam_. The last clause of the second line, therefore, means _sa moksham apnoti_, _yatah prajabhyah_ (or prajanam) _abhayam_. The dative, not ablative as the vernacular translators take it, is not bad grammar, although the genitive is more agreeable with usage.

[^532]: 199:1 A tentative version is offered here, following the actual words used in the original.

[^533]: 199:2 All these expressions apply to the Supreme Soul. Immeasurable in the firmament implies that the Supreme Being is vaster than the firmament. ‘Made of gold’ means, as the commentator explains, Chit having knowledge only for its attribute.’ ‘Born of the egg,’ _i.e._, belonging to the universe. ‘Within the egg’ means ‘capable of being apprehended in the heart.’ ‘Equipped with many feathers,’ _i.e._, having many limbs each of which is presided over by a particular deity. The two wings are absence of attachment or complete dissociation from everything, and joy and gladness and aptitude for enjoyment. ‘Rendered effulgent by many rays of light,’ _i.e._, transformed into a living and active agent by means of eyes, cars, etc.

[^534]: 199:3 The sense is that he who understands the wheel of Time is a person worthy of universal regard. The excellent joints of that wheel are the _parva_ days, _viz_., those sacred lunations on which religious rites are performed.

[^535]: 199:4 I give a little version of verse 33, following the commentator as regards the meaning of _samprasadam_. The sense, however, of the verse is this: _Brahma_, in the previous sections, has often been spoken of as _Sushupti_ or the unconsciousness of dreamless slumber. The universe flows from _Brahma_. Unconsciousness, therefore, is the cause or origin or body of the universe. That unconsciousness, therefore, pervades all things, _viz_., gross and subtile. _Jiva_, finding a place within that unconsciousness existing in the form of gross and subtile, gratifies the deities, _prana_ and the senses. These, thus gratified by _jiva_, at last gratify the open mouth of the original unconsciousness that waits to receive or swallow them. All these verses are based upon the figurative ideas that find expression in the Upanishads.

[^536]: 200:1 _Smriti_ is memory. One whose _smriti_, is lost means one whose conceptions of right and wrong are confounded. _Atmanah sampradanena_ is ‘by the surrender of oneself’ to one's own passions or _Kamadibhyah_ as the commentator explains.

[^537]: 201:1 _Chittam_ is explained by the commentator as the gross understanding, and _Sattwa_ as the subtile understanding.. The understanding that is concerned with the images brought by the mind or the senses is called gross; while that which is concerned with ideas about _Brahma_ is called subtile. _Kalanjara_ is explained by the commentator either as standing for the mountain of that name, _i.e._, irremovable as the mountain so called; or, as one who destroys the effect of Time, _i.e._, one who subdues Time instead of being subdued by that universal conqueror.

[^538]: 201:2 The purification here referred to consists in transcending the consciousness of duality. Righteousness should be avoided because of its incapacity to lead to Emancipation which is much higher than heaven. _Atmani sthitwa_ means living in one's real or true nature, _i.e._, merging everything into the Soul. This is attained when the consciousness of duality is transcended.

[^539]: 201:3 _Atmanam_ in the first line is the Jiva-soul, and _atmani_ is the Supreme Soul. In the second line also, the same distinction is observed between the two words.

[^540]: 201:4 Brahmanas, who having completed the study of the Vedas have betaken themselves to the domestic mode of life, are so called. Here, probably, the reference is to persons having faith in the Vedas and of pure conduct.

[^541]: 202:1 _Adhyatma_ is topic bearing on the Soul. Here it signifies the seven and twenty usual topics of philosophical discourse, _viz_., the five organs of action, the five organs of knowledge, the mind and three others called Chitta, etc., the five vital breaths, the five elementary substances, Desire. Acts, and _Avidya_.

[^542]: 202:2 The second clause of the second line is explained by the commentator as _yasmin kamani nimitte sati yat anupasyati_.

[^543]: 203:1 The grammatical construction is _Gunebhyah paramagatah gunan na ativartante_. The meaning is this: Mind, Understanding, and Nature (or individual disposition of man or animal or vegetable, etc) are all due to their own previous states. Nature in particular being the result of the desires of a past state of existence. Such being their origin, they too are due to the five entities named. As regards their functions, it is said that having reached to that which is _Gunebhyah parama_, _i.e._, _Srotradikaryam swarupam_, they do not transcend the _gunas_ themselves; or in other words having become endued with the faculty or power of seizing particular attributes (such as scent, form, etc)., they actually seize or apprehend them.

[^544]: 203:2 In other words, the senses and the mind are nothing but the understanding displayed in a particular shape or form. The principal function of the mind is to cherish and discard impressions. The understanding is _nischayatmika_ or engaged in arriving at certainty of conclusions.

[^545]: 203:3 Everything above the soles of, the feet and below the crown of the head, is, of course, the whole body or self or the person. _Asmin kritye_ is, _aham iti yat darsanam tasmin karaniye_. There can be no doubt that the commentator correctly explains the meaning.

[^546]: 203:4 _Neniyate_ is as the commentator explains, an instance of _karmakartari prayogah_. Hence, the meaning is that both the attributes of form etc., and the senses with mind which apprehend those attributes, are the understanding itself, so that when the understanding is not, these also are not. The object of this verse is to establish the identity of the understanding with the senses, the mind, and the attribute with the senses and the mind apprehend. Both the vernacular versions are inaccurate.

[^547]: 204:1 The three attributes of _Rajas_, _Tamas_, and _Sattwa_ do not spring front any different thing but from their own counterparts existing in a previous state of existence or life. They arise from their respective states as they existed with the _Chitta_ or understanding in a previous life. Hence _Chitta_, and the objects of the senses and the senses also arising from it, are all affected by these three Gunas.

[^548]: 204:2 The last word in the first line is not _prabodhita_ but _aprabodhita_.

[^549]: 204:3 In the original, the word atman is used in various senses. Sometimes it stands for the Jiva-soul, sometimes for the Supreme Soul, sometimes for essence or the principal portion of anything, sometimes for one's own self, and sometimes even for the person or body. It is not difficult to distinguish in which sense the word is used in what place.

[^550]: 205:1 _Vela_ is tide or current. The Understanding, although it exists with the three states of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, can yet transcend them by Yoga. The ordinary and extraordinary states of the understanding are spoken of in this verse.

[^551]: 205:2 The Bengal texts make this a verse of one line. In the Bombay text, verse 9 is made a triplet, so that this line is included in it. _Medhyani_ is explained as _medha, rupadi jnanam, tatra tani_.

[^552]: 205:3 If I have understood this verse correctly, the theory of perception laid down is a sort of idealism which has not, perhaps, its counterpart in European metaphysics. The senses are first said to be only modifications of the understanding. The mind also is only a modification of the same. A particular sense, say the eye, becomes subservient to the understanding at a particular moment. As soon as this happens, the understanding, though in reality it is only the eye, becomes united with the eye, and entering the mind raises an image there, the consequence of which is that that image is said to be seen. External world there is, of course, as independent of mind and understanding. That which is called a tree is only an idea or image created in the mind by the understanding with the aid of the sense of vision.

[^553]: 205:4 The speaker here combats the theory that the qualities of _Sattwa_, _Rajas_, and _Tamas_ inhere to the objects themselves of the senses. His own view is that they inhere to the Mind, the Understanding, and Consciousness. The qualities may be seen to exist with objects, but in reality they follow objects in consequence of their permanent connection with the mind, the understanding, and consciousness which have agency in the production of objects. The commentator cites the instance of a wife's beautiful and symmetrical limbs. These excite pleasure in the husband, envy in a co-wife, and desire (mixed with pain at its not being p. 206 gratified) in a weak-hearted gazer. All the while the limbs remain unchanged. Then again, the husband is not always pleased with them, nor is the co-wife always filled with envy at their sight, nor is the gazer always agitated. Like the spokes of a wheel which are attached to the circumference and which move with circumference, the qualities of Sattwa, etc., attached to the mind, understanding and consciousness, move along with them, _i.e._, follow those objects in the production of which the mind, etc., are causes.

[^554]: 206:1 This version of verse is offered tentatively. I give the substance without following the exact order of the original. Compare this verse with 42 of section 194 _ante_.

[^555]: 206:2 As soon as the darkness of the understanding is dispelled and true knowledge succeeds, the Soul becomes visible.

[^556]: 206:3 _i.e._, who adopts the Sannyasa or the last mode of life after having duly gone through the preceding modes.

[^557]: 207:1 _Gunan_ in the first line means _Vishayan_, in the second line it means _Sattivadin_, _Vikriyatah_ is _vikram bhajamanan_. How the understanding creates objects has been explained in previous sections.

[^558]: 207:2 _Na nivartante_ is explained by the commentator as _na ghatadivat nasyanti kintu rajjuragadiva badha eva_, etc., and he concludes by saying that according to this theory _niranvayanasa eva gunanam_, or, in other words, that the Gunas are not so destroyed by knowledge that they do not return.

[^559]: 207:3 According to the speaker then, there is not much practical difference between the two opinions here adverted to, and one's course of conduct will not be much affected by either of the theories that one may, after reflection, adopt.

[^560]: 208:1 _Janmasamartham_ is explained as certain to be acquired by virtue of birth or of the practice of the duties laid down for one's own order. _Parayanam_ is _moksha-prapakam_.

[^561]: 208:2 The Bengal reading _buddhah_ is preferable to the Bombay reading _Suddhah_ which would be pleonastic in view of what follows in the second line.

[^562]: 208:3 _Lokam_ is explained as _lokyate iti lokah_, _i.e._, objects of enjoyment such as wife, etc., _aturam_, is afflicted with faults or defects. _Ubhayam kritakritam_ is as the commentator explains, _sokasokarupam_ or _aropitam_ and _anaropitam_.

[^563]: 208:4 Many of the verses of this and the previous section correspond with those of section 194 _ante_. Many verbal changes, however, are noticeable. In consequences of those changes, the meaning sometimes becomes lightly and sometimes materially different.

[^564]: 209:1 _Gocharaebhyah_, literally, pastures, is used here to signify all external and internal objects upon which the senses and the mind are employed. Their proper home or abode is said to be _Brahma_.

[^565]: 209:2 The absence of anything like precision in the language employed in such verses frequently causes confusion. The word _atma_ as used in the first line is very indefinite. The commentator thinks it implies _achetanabuddhi_, _i.e._, the perishable understanding. I prefer, however, to take it as employed in the sense of _Chit_ as modified by birth. It conies, I think, to the same thing in the end. The ‘inner Soul’ is, perhaps, the Soul or _Chit_ as unmodified by birth and attributes.

[^566]: 210:1 _Abhavapratipattyartham_ is explained by the commentator as ‘for the attainment of the unborn or the soul.’

[^567]: 210:2 The commentator explains the first line thus: _yatha sarvani matani tatha etani vachansi me_. He takes the words: _yatha tatha kathitani maya_ as implying that ‘I have treated of the topic _yathatathyena_.’

[^568]: 211:1 The commentator explains that _tasya tasya_ has reference to _gandhadeh_. _Pracharah_ means _vyavahara_. _Pasyatah_ is _Vidushah_.

[^569]: 211:2 _i.e._, one that only knows the Vedas and has observed the vow of Brahmacharya is not a superior Brahmana. To become so requires something more.

[^570]: 211:3 I follow the commentator closely in rendering this verse. _Sarvavit_ is taken in the sense of _Brahmavit_. _Akamah_ is one contented with knowledge of Self. Such a man, the _Srutis_ declare, never dies or perishes. The two negatives in the last clause nullify each other. The Burdwan translator, with the gloss before him, for he cites copiously from it, misunderstands the negatives. K.P. Singha is correct.

[^571]: 211:4 _Avidhanat_ is explained as _dayanaishkainyayorananusaranat_.

[^572]: 211:5 _Kamakantah_ is explained as _kamaih kantah_, _i.e._, _manoharah_.

[^573]: 211:6 Heaven is _Brahma_ invested with attributes. Tranquillity of soul is _Brahma_ uninvested with attributes. _Upanishat_ is explained as _rahasyam_. This 'render ‘recondite object’. p. 212 The sense of the verse is that each of the things mentioned is useless without that which comes next; and as tranquillity or _Brahma_ uninvested with attributes is the ultimate end, the Vedas and truth, etc., are valuable only because they lead to tranquillity.

[^574]: 212:1 Both the Vernacular translators have rendered this verse wrongly. In the first place, _ichcchasi_ is equivalent to _ichccheta_. _Santoshat_ is 'for the sake of _santosha_. _Sattwam_ is _buddhiprasadam_. _Manas_ is explained as _sankalpa_ or _samsaya_. The grammatical order is _sokamanasoh santapya kledanam_. The commentator adds _santapamiti namulantam_, _i.e._, formed by the suffix _namul_.

[^575]: 212:2 _Samagrah_ is literally ‘full or complete,’ implying that such a man becomes _jnana-triptah_. Only five attributes are mentioned in this verse but _santosha_ mentioned in verse 13 should be taken to make up six.

[^576]: 212:3 Both the vernacular translators have rendered this verse incorrectly. In the first place _shadbhih_ has reference to the six things mentioned in verse 11 and 12 above. These six again should be _satwagunopetaih_, _i.e._, destitute of the attributes of _Rajas_ and _Tamas_. Unless freed from those two, even the six, of themselves, will not lead to knowledge of the Soul. _Tribhih_ has reference to _Sravana_, _manana_, and _nididhyasana_. _Ihastham_ is ‘residing within the body.’ _Pretya_ implies transcending consciousness of body or _jivati eva dehe dehabhimanadutthaya_. _Tam gunam is muktalakshanam_. The sense, in simple words, is this: transcending all consciousness of body they that succeed in knowing the Soul which resides within the body become emancipated. The first line of the verse simply points out how the Soul may be known.

[^577]: 212:4 _Anweti_ is explained as _vardhate_.

[^578]: 213:1 The reading I adopt is _saviseshani_, and not _aviseshani_ although the latter is not incorrect. In treatises on _yoga_, _viseshah_ imply the gross elements and the eleven senses including the mind. _Aviseshah_ imply the five subtile elements (tanmatrani) and _buddhi_. By _Gunan_ is meant _Mahat_ and _Avyakta_ or _Prakriti_. If _aviseshani_ be taken, the reference to the subtile elements would imply that the grosser once have already been transcended.

[^579]: 213:2 _Atikrantaguna-kshayam_, _i.e._, one who has transcended disregards the very puissance that the destruction of the gunas is said to bring about.

[^580]: 213:3 _Karyyatam_ is Prakriti which alone is active, Purusha being inactive. _Paramam karanam_ is, of course, Brahma uninvested with attributes.

[^581]: 213:4 _Dwandwani_ is governed by _anushthitah_. _Mahat_ here is elaborate. The speaker, having first discussed the subject elaborately, intends to speak of it in brief in this Section.

[^582]: 213:5 _Panchasu_ is explained by the commentator as _Panchatmakeshu_. Hence, he properly points out that _bhava_ and _abhava_ and _kala_ are included by the speaker within bhutas or primary elements. Bhava implies the four entities called _karma_, _samanya_, _visesha_ and _samavaya_. By _abhava_ is meant a negative state with respect to attributes not possessed by a thing. We cannot think of a thing without thinking of it as uninvested with certain attributes whatever other attributes it may possess.

[^583]: 214:1 Enlarged, the constructions of the original becomes thus: ‘_uttareshu_ (bhuteshu) (purvabhuta) _gunah_ (santi).’

[^584]: 214:2 _Uttarah_ imply the three entities known by the names of _Avidya_ (Ignorance), _Kama_ (desire), and _Karma_ (acts). This part of the verse is skipped over by the vernacular translators.

[^585]: 214:3 _i.e._, the soul when invested with Avidya and desire becomes a living creature and engages in acts. It is through consequences then that are derived from acts that the infinite Soul (or Chit) becomes Jivatman.

[^586]: 214:4 This is a very difficult verse and no wonder that both the vernacular versions are defective. K.P. Singha gives the substance, skipping over many of the words. The Burdwan translator, though citing largely from the gloss, misunderstands both verse and gloss completely. The grammatical construction is this: _Ebhih sarvaih kalatmakaih bhavaih anwitam sarvam yah akalushiam pasyati_ (_sah_) _samoham karma nanuvartate_. _Sarvam_ here refers to _pranijatam_ or the entire assemblage of living creatures. _Kalatmakaih bhavaih_ is _punyapapadi samskaratmabhih_. _Bhavaih_ is taken by the commentator as equivalent to _bhavanabhih_. I prefer to take it in the sense of entity. He who looks upon these as _akalusham_, _i.e._, as unstained Chit (that is, he who has a knowledge of the Soul), becomes freed from _samoham karma_, _i.e._, succeeds in becoming _nishkamah_ in consequence of his acquaintance with _atmatattwa_.

[^587]: 215:1 ‘Conversant with the scriptures,’ _i.e._, Yogin; ‘acts laid down in the scriptures’ are the practices connected with Yoga. _Saririnam_, the commentator takes, implies the Soul as invested with a subtile body; of course, _Saririn_ as distinguished from _Sariram_ generally means the Soul or the owner of the _Sariram_ without reference to the body. Hence, the word cannot be taken as referring to the Soul as uninvested with the _lingasarira_.

[^588]: 215:2 I follow the commentator in his exposition of this verse. _Sahitah_ is _nividah_; _drisyamanah_ is explained as ‘though unseen by the eye is yet realised through instruction and by the aid of reason.’

[^589]: 215:3 _Tapah_ is _rasmi-mandalam_. _Prati-rupam_ is _pratyupa-dhi_. _Sattwam_ is _sattwapradhanalingam_. The sense, in simple words, seems to be that the Yogin beholds within his own body and those of others the Souls or Chits residing there as invested in subtile forms.

[^590]: 215:4 Both _atmachintitam_ and _karmajam_ _rajas_ are governed by _Jahatam_. The first means all that is: ‘_kalpitah_ in self’ _i.e._, the creations of the understanding or the mind, implying, of course, the objects of the senses or the external world. The second means _kamadi vyasanam_, _i.e._, the calamities constituted by desire, etc. _Pradhanadwaidhamuktah_ is one who is freed from identity with Pradhana or the Universal cause; hence, the puissance that Yoga brings about. Such Yogins have their subtile forms under complete control under all conditions and at all times. They can enter at will into other forms. _Sattwatma_ is _linga-dehah_.

[^591]: 215:5 _Satatam_ qualifies _anwitah_. _Nityam_ qualifies _charishnuh_. _Sadanityah_ is explained by the commentator as in reality terminable, though the words always etc., have been used. The plain meaning of the verse is that Yogins, in their linga body, rove everywhere, not excluding the most blissful regions in heaven itself.

[^592]: 215:6 The meaning is this: like Yogins, ordinary men even have the _linga-sariram_. In dreams, the gross body is inactive. Only the subtile body acts and feels. The Burdwan translator misunderstands this verse completely.

[^593]: 216:1 _Atikramanti_ is understood at the end of the verse. _Vajropamani_ is explained by the commentator as ‘so undying that they are not destroyed at even the universal destruction; hence, of course, the _karana_ bodies.’ The _karana_ bodies are the potentialities, existing in the _tanmatra_ of the elemental substances, of forming diverse kinds of linga bodies in consequence of the acts of _Jiva_ in previous periods of existence.

[^594]: 216:2 _Etat_ is: _maduktam vakyam_; _yogam_ implies _yogapradhanam_. _Samadhau samam_ has reference to ‘yogam.’ What are the speaker wishes to say in this verse is that _dhyana_ is not laid down for Sannyasins alone but it is laid down for all others as well.

[^595]: 216:3 _Pradhanam_ is _Avidya_ or Ignorance. _Viniyoga_ is _Viparinama_. The particle _anu_ always interpreted as ‘following’ the scriptures or some special branch of knowledge that treats of the subject spoken of.

[^596]: 217:1 The correct reading is _ayasaih_ meaning ‘made of iron,’ and not ‘ayasaih.’ K.P. Singha adheres to the incorrect reading. The chains of iron here are either the diverse longings cherished by worldly men, or, perhaps, the bodies with which men are invested.

[^597]: 217:2 The dual genitive _duhkhayoh_ is used because worldly _sukha_ also is regarded as _duhkha_. ‘Tyajamannah’ is equivalent to ‘tyaktum ichccha.’ It is an instance of _hetau sanach_.

[^598]: 217:3 _Yena_ is explained as _Stryadina hetuna_. ‘_Sah_’ is: _Stryadih_: _Samrohati_ is: _Vardhayati_. ‘Tam’ is: _Vardhakam_.

[^599]: 217:4 ‘Uddhriyate’ is literally ‘tears up.’ The use of the word ‘asina’ suggests also ‘cutting.’ The root of the tree, of course, is Avidya or Ignorance.

[^600]: 217:5 K.P. Singha wrongly translates the first line. The Burdwan translator quotes the gloss without understanding it. The first half of the first line, literally rendered, is ‘the senses are the mind-citizens,’ meaning, as the commentator rightly explains, that they are citizens under the lead of the mind. ‘Tadartham’ means ‘for the sake of the senses,’ _i.e._, ‘for cherishing them.’ _Prakritih_ is _mahati kriya pravrittih_, _Tadartham_ is _kriyaphalam_, _i.e._, happiness or misery. The meaning, in brief, is this: the body is a city. The understanding is its mistress. The mind is her principal servitor. The senses are the citizens under the lead of the mind. In order to cherish the senses the mind engages in acts productive of visible and invisible fruits _i.e._, sacrifices and gifts, and the acquisition of houses and gardens, etc. Those acts are liable to two faults, _viz_., Rajas and Tamas. The senses (both in this life and the succeeding ones) depend upon the fruits (happiness or misery) of those acts.

[^601]: 217:6 The meaning is this: the senses, the mind, the understanding, etc., are all due to acts. These, therefore, are said to rest upon acts and draw their sustenance therefrom.

[^602]: 218:1 I expand the first line of 14 for giving the meaning clearly.

[^603]: 218:2 The sense is that the understanding, being stained or afflicted, the Soul also becomes stained or afflicted. _Enam_ is _atmanam_. _Vidhritam_ is ‘placed like an image upon a mirror.’

[^604]: 218:3 Because the son had not yet obtained the light of full knowledge.

[^605]: 218:4 It is curious to note how carelessly this verse is rendered in the Burdwan version. In the Bengal texts there is a misprint, _viz_., _tatha_ for _rasah_. The Burdwan translator does not notice it, but gives just eight qualities instead of ten. Capacity to be congealed is to be inferred from _cha_. K.P. Singha is correct.

[^606]: 219:1 The _Rishis_, it is evident, regarded an entity not as an unknown substance in which certain known properties inhered, but as the sum total of those properties themselves. So far as the human mind is concerned, there is no warrant for the proposition that matter is an unknown substance in which extension, and divisibility etc., inhere; on the other hand, matter, as it appears to us, is only extension, divisibility, etc., existing in a combined state.

[^607]: 219:2 The elements are five in number. Their properties number fifty. The five especial properties of the understanding should be added to those five and fifty. The total, therefore, of the properties of the understanding comes up to sixty.

[^608]: 219:3 This is a difficult verse. _Anagatam_ is _agama-viruddham_. The grammatical construction, as explained by the commentator, is this: _tat_ (tasmin or purvaslokokokte vishaya yat) _anagatam tava uktam tat chintakalilam_. (Twam tu) _samprati iha_ (loke) _tat_ (maduktam) _bhutarthatattwamsarvam avapya bhuta-prabhavat santabuddhi bhava_. _Bhutarthah_ is Brahma, and _bhutaprabhavat_ is _Brahmaiswaryat_. (This is an instance of the ablative with ‘lyap’ understood). What Bhishma wishes Yudhishthira to do is not so much to attend to the various theories about the origin of the universe but to carefully attend to the method of attaining to _Brahma_. To be of tranquil heart, of course, implies the possession of a _nirvrittika buddhi_.

[^609]: 220:1 _i.e._, they could be slain by only their equals who were engaged with them, meaning that all those warriors were very superior men. They could not possibly be slain by others than those with whom they fought.

[^610]: 222:1 In the case of gods and _Rishis_, thinking and summoning are the same.

[^611]: 223:1 The commentator explains that the accusatives in the first line of verse 5 governed by _hareyam_ in the previous verse.

[^612]: 223:2 A _Padmaka_ consists of ten digits, _i.e._, a thousand millions or a billion according to the French method of calculation.

[^613]: 223:3 To lead a life in the woods with the deer and after the manner of the deer confers great merit. _Vide_ the story of Yayati's daughter Madhavi in the Udyoga Parvam _ante_.

[^614]: 224:1 The commentator explains that this means that Death would attain to the status of all-pervading _Brahma_. Even this is the boon that the Self-born grants her for protecting her against iniquity and allaying her fears.

[^615]: 224:2 _i.e._, being freed from wrath and aversion.

[^616]: 225:1 Vasishtha's work commences with the query—What is dharmah? The first answer is ‘anything consistent with the _Srutis_ and the _Smritis_.’ Then comes _Sishtacharah_ or the conduct of those called _Sishta_ or the good.

[^617]: 225:2 However casuists may argue and moralists pretend, a lie like that of Sir Henry Lee for saving his prince from the hands of Cromwell (vide _Woodstock_), or like that of the goldsmith's son, even when he was dying, for saving the prince Chevalier from the hands of his would-be captors, is excusable in the estimation of many and even meritorious according to some. p. 226 The world again is agreed that if an adulterer be called into the witness box, perjury would be a venal offence compared with the meanness of betraying the honour of a confiding woman. Hence, the exclusion of such a witness (according to almost every system of law) in trials for adultery. The _Rishis_ wrote for men and not angels. The conduct referred to is that of the good and pious.

[^618]: 226:1 In explaining verse 7, the commentator uses the words that I have enclosed within parenthesis. According to him, verse 9 hath reference to the robbed thief while he goes to the king for invoking justice.

[^619]: 226:2 There is another reason why one should not give way to intoxication of might and should not set at naught the eternal injunction against taking what belongs to another K.P. Singha incorrectly translates this line.

[^620]: 226:3 Implying that such a man is always alive to his own faults. He never thinks that others are guilty of an offence which he, in a moment of temptation, may have committed.

[^621]: 227:1 K.P. Singha wrongly translates this line.

[^622]: 227:2 The construction is not at all difficult; yet both the vernacular translators have misunderstood it, the Burdwan version being thoroughly unintelligible. This is only another form of the well-known saying—‘do to others as you would that they should do to you.’

[^623]: 227:3 The Burdwan translator gives an incorrect version of the second line: _yad_ is equivalent to _yadi_: _anyasya_ stands for _anyam_. The genitive inflection is used for the accusative. _Tatah_ stands for _tasmin_ implying _aupapatye vishaye_. _Kuryat_ is _driggochari-kuryat_.

[^624]: 227:4 The surplus should not be coveted for its own sake but for such use.

[^625]: 227:5 The second line is incorrectly rendered by K.P. Singha.

[^626]: 227:6 _Priyabhyupagatam_ is _priyena praptam_ and not _hinsaya_.

[^627]: 228:1 I am not sure that I have understood the original correctly. Nilakantha says that the sense intended to be conveyed is that Yudhishthira finds fault with Bhishma's previous course on the indications of righteousness.

[^628]: 228:2 The argument, as explained by the commentator is this: Bhishma has said that righteousness and its reverse arise from one's acts producing happiness or misery to others, and that they both affect one's future life in respect to the happiness and misery enjoyed or endured therein. But living creatures, says Yudhishthira, are seen to take their births, exist, and die, of their own nature. Nature, therefore, seems to be the efficient cause of birth, existence, and death, and not the declarations in the Srutis, consistent though those declarations be with considerations of felicity or the reverse. The study of the Vedas, therefore, cannot alone lead to a knowledge of righteousness and its reverse.

[^629]: 228:3 Distress may be of infinite variety. Derogation also from duty may, therefore, be of infinite variety. It is impossible to note these derogations (justifiable in view of the degree of distress felt) in any code of morals, however comprehensive.

[^630]: 228:4 The commentator cites the example of Sudras listening to forbidden scriptures in expectation of merit. They commit sin by such acts. Then again high Brahmanas like Agastya, by cursing the denizens of the Dandaka forest, achieved great merit. In persons universally called ordinary or even low, indications are observable of good behaviour, and in those acknowledged to be good and respectable, acts may be noticed that are not good. That therefore, which is called the conduct of the good is extremely unascertainable.

[^631]: 229:1 The commentator cites the instance of the stoppage of the Horse-sacrifice in consequence of the interference of Indra with Janamejaya while the latter was bent upon celebrating one for the acquisition of merit.

[^632]: 229:2 The vapoury edifices and forms seen in the distant sky are called _Gandharva-nagara_ from the peculiar belief that they are cities or towns inhabited by the Gandharvas, a class of beings superior to men. They appear to the view only to disappear very soon. What the speaker wishes to say is that sacrifices and religious acts at first appear romantic and delightful in consequence of the fruits they hold forth, _viz_., heaven and felicity. But when they are examined by the light of philosophy, they disappear or shrink into nothingness, for as acts, they are transitory and their consequences too are of the same character.

[^633]: 229:3 The object of this verse is to show that it is extremely difficult to ascertain who the good are whose conduct should be taken as the standard of righteousness.

[^634]: 229:4 The commentator cites the instance of Drona and others of that class. These men must be regarded as Mahajanas and Sadhus, but how can their conduct be regarded as righteous? What Yudhishthira means to say is that the standards of righteousness or that by which a good man may be known, is difficult of ascertainment.

[^635]: 229:5 The example of Viswamitra, Jamadagnya, and Vasishtha are cited by the commentator. The first won pre-eminence by his mastery over weapons. The second lost his character as a Brahmana by the profession of arms. The third lost nothing although he punished Viswamitra's insolence by using even carnal weapons.

[^636]: 230:1 What Yudhishthira says here is that righteousness or virtue or duty does not depend upon the _Srutis_ or the _Smritis_, nor upon considerations of happiness or misery. On the other hand, righteousness is arbitrary in respect of its standard, that being called righteous which was called so by the learned of ancient times. As regards happiness or misery, its cause is eternal nature.

[^637]: 230:2 In this connection,' _i.e._, the subject of the true cause to which is to be ascribed the dispensation of happiness or its reverse.

[^638]: 230:3 His gross body was within the water. Nevertheless, by Yoga power, he was able to rove over the world in his subtile body and beheld everything he wished to see.

[^639]: 231:1 _Criya_ is explained by the commentator as implying the possession of Vedic lore.

[^640]: 232:1 This was a new vow that Jajali began to observe, the vow, _viz_., of travelling over the entire earth, sleeping there where evening overtook him.

[^641]: 232:2 A Beniya's shop is a miscellaneous depot. It contains chiefly spices and drugs, but there is no article for domestic use that may not be found in such a shop.

[^642]: 232:3 _Bhandajivanah_ is one who lays out capital and lives upon its profits.

[^643]: 233:1 _Charin_ is _sancharanam_ for food.

[^644]: 233:2 In some of the Bengal texts, verse consists of 3 lines. The 3rd line, however, is omitted in the Bombay edition.

[^645]: 233:3 The commentator observes that in the second line the speaker explains what morality with its mysteries is.

[^646]: 233:4 _Padmaka_ or _Padma-kashta_ is the rootstock of Nymphoea lotus. A kind of medicinal wood also is indicated by it, which is brought from Malwa and Southern India. To this day, it enters into the composition of many drugs used by Hindu Physicians. _Tunga_ is either the filaments of the lotus, or the tree called _Punnaga_ which is identified with the Calophyllum inophyllum of the Linnean genera. The Bombay reading _parichcchinnaih_ for _parachcchinnaih_ does not seem to be correct.

[^647]: 234:1 In the Bengal editions, verse consists of one line. In the Bombay text, it is included with the 10th verse which is made a triplet. The meaning is that weighing creatures I regard all of them as equal. In my scales a Brahmana does not weigh heavier than a Chandala, or an elephant heavier than a dog or cat.

[^648]: 234:2 The sense is this: there is variety in this world. It is, however, like the variety of aspects which the sky shows. It is the same Godhead that manifests itself in diverse forms even as it is the same sky that puts forth various aspects in consequence of the appearance and disappearance of clouds.

[^649]: 234:3 _Devairapihita-dwarah_ means persons whose doors (senses) have been closed by the deities, _i.e._, men with senses that are defective or lost.

[^650]: 234:4 That state is _Brahma_, and there is no fear of return from it. Hence, it is called _abhayam padam_.

[^651]: 234:5 The commentator explains that the mention of _putra-pautrinam_ indicates that _kulachara_ or family practices (if not very cruel) are authoritative.

[^652]: 235:1 The correct reading seems to be _vimuchyate_.—The sense is this: there is an eternal course of righteousness as laid down in the Vedas. That which is called the conduct of the good may sometimes be stained by some errors. Fools, led by this, give up righteousness itself. On the other hand, wise men, avoiding those errors, take what is good and are saved. An old saying is cited by the commentator to the effect that when all is threatened, a wise man gives up half for saving the remainder. A fool, however, gives up the whole when only half is threatened with destruction.

[^653]: 235:2 The word _iha_ in verse is the only indication of the speaker's desire to allude to the union of relatives in this world.

[^654]: 235:3 K.P. Singha. quietly omits the second half of the second line. The Burdwan translator, as usual, blunders in rendering it. The fact is, _krosatah_ is not an adjective of _vrikat_, but stands for the roaring Vadava fire. The commentator distinctly mentions _drishtante Vadavagnih_.

[^655]: 235:4 Both the Vernacular translators have misunderstood this verse.

[^656]: 235:5 _Alpahrillekhah_ is explained by the commentator as _alpam vahyasukham hridilekheva pratishthitam yesham_; hence, men who seek ordinary felicity, _viz_., that which has a termination. The _patavah_ are of course, the truly wise, _i.e._, those that seek felicity that is unending. _Kritsna_ is _Brahma_; _tadartham abhayadanamitinirnaya yesham_, _i.e._, the truly wise practice it for the sake of _Brahma_. It is almost impossible to understand verses such as these without the aid of the commentator.

[^657]: 236:1 _Padashinah_ has reference to _Devah_. The _sandhi_ in _Devapi_ is _arsha_. The deities become stupefied in his _track_, _i.e._, fail to see or find it out, for such a man is _apadah_, _i.e._, transcends the highest regions of felicity, such as even the region of Brahman, because of their non-eternity. Such a man attains to _Brahma_, which is infinite and eternal.

[^658]: 236:2 _Bhuta_ is explained by the commentator as _Brahma_, and _Bhavya_, as heaven or the regions of felicity in the next world. In the Vedas both kinds of duties occur, such as _Samah_, etc., for Brahma, and sacrifices, &c., for heaven.

[^659]: 236:3 The commentator cites some conflicting ordinances about the slaughter of kine. The subject of duty, is thus confused, contradictory declarations being noticeable in the Vedas.

[^660]: 236:4 _Badha_ here means striking or beating. If taken in the sense of ‘death’ the meaning would be putting some to death so that others may be frightened. These verses are a noble protest against the institution of slavery.

[^661]: 237:1 Some texts read _Prishadhro-gamlavanniva_, meaning _Prishadhara_ perpetrated a great sin by killing a cow (mistaking it for a tiger, as the story goes).

[^662]: 237:2 The cow is called the mother because of the use to which she is subservient. Her milk nourishes every infant as much as the mother's bosom. The bull, again, is _Prajapati_, because like _Prajapati_ he creates offspring and assists man in the production of food.

[^663]: 237:3 Nahusha had killed a cow and a bull for honouring the _Rishis_. The latter, however, expressed their dissatisfaction at the act, and cleansed him of the sin in the manner indicated in the text. The commentator cites the instance of how Indra was cleansed of the sin of Brahmanicide. The _Rishis_, in compassion, distributed the sin among all beings of the feminine sex. That sin manifests itself in their periodical flows and the consequent impurity.

[^664]: 237:4 The commentator explains that the _Rishis_ addressed Nahusha in that style even when they knew that he had not intentionally slain the cow and the bull. The object of the speaker is to show the enormity of the act when done intentionally.

[^665]: 238:1 The fact is, all Sacrifices, in which injury is done to animal and vegetable life are Sacrifices for Kshatriyas. The only Sacrifice that Brahmanas should perform is _Yoga_.

[^666]: 238:2 Sacrifices are always attractive for the fame they bring. Their performance depends upon wealth. The acquisition of wealth leads to the commission of many evil acts.

[^667]: 239:1 The sense is that in former days when the true meaning of Sacrifice was understood and all men performed them without being urged by the desire of fruit, the beneficial consequences that flowed were the production of crops without tillage (and without injury to animals that live in holes and burrows). The good wishes the _Rishis_ cherished for all creatures were sufficient to produce herbs and plants and trees. May not this be taken as an indication of the traditional idea of the happiness of Eden before the fall of man?

[^668]: 239:2 ‘Bereft of wisdom’ is explained by the commentator as implying the non-attainment of emancipation.

[^669]: 239:3 This verse is exceedingly terse and condensed. In the second line, the words _Brahmana vartate loke_, literally rendered, mean ‘who believes that only Brahma exists in the world.’ The commentator takes these words as implying ‘who regards every essential of Sacrifice as Brahma.’ Although I have followed the commentator, yet I think his interpretation to be rather far-fetched. Why may not the words be taken in a literal sense? He who takes _Brahma_ to be all things and all things to be _Brahma_, becomes sinless and deserves to be called a Brahmana. The last word of the second tine simply means ‘who does not regard his own self as the actor.’ The view expressed in the _Gita_ is that we should do all acts believing ourselves to be only agents or instruments of the Supreme deity. Acts are His, we are only His tools. Such a conviction is sure to guard us against all evil acts.

[^670]: 239:4 What is said in verse 17 is that when Sacrifices are done from a sense of duty, notwithstanding their incompleteness, they become efficacious. It is only when they are performed from desire of fruit that expiation becomes necessary if their completion be obstructed by any cause. Having thus applauded the Sacrifices (represented by acts) of the truly wise, other kinds of Sacrifices are indicated in verse 18. K.P. Singha translates 18 correctly. The Burdwan version is erroneous.

[^671]: 240:1 _Swayajna_ is literally 'sacrifice in one's own self'; hence, Yoga, _Brahmam vedam_ is _Pranava_ or _Om_.

[^672]: 240:2 K.P. Singha erroneously translates this verse. The Burdwan version, so far as it goes, is correct. _Sarvam Brahma_ is explained as _Pranava_, which is _akhilam daivatam_, for the _Srutis_ declare that _Omkarah sarvadaivatyah_, _Brahmani_ is _Brahmavidi_. What is intended to be said in this verse is that when such a man eats and is gratified, the whole universe becomes gratified. In the Vana Parvam, Krishna, by swallowing a particle of pottage gratified the hunger of thousands of Durvasa's pupils.

[^673]: 240:3 Such a man regards all things as Brahma, and himself as Brahma.

[^674]: 240:4 K.P. Singha blunders in rendering the second half of the first line. _Yasah_, the commentator explains, is _Mahadyasah_ or Brahma. ‘The path of the righteous,’ the commentator thinks, is Yoga.

[^675]: 240:5 _i.e._, they perform mental Sacrifices.

[^676]: 240:6 ‘For the reason,’ _i.e._, because they cannot officiate at the Sacrifices of those that are truly good. In the second line (28 is a triplet), the nominative _sadhavah_ is understood. The meaning is that such men, that is, the truly good, accomplish their own duties not for benefiting their own selves but for the good of others. What is said in the third line is that p. 241 observing both kinds of behaviour, _i.e._, that of the good and that of the misguided, I follow the path of the former by abstaining from every kind of injury.

[^677]: 241:1 _Yajneshu_ is ‘among Sacrifices.’ _Yani_ has reference to the different kinds of the Sacrifices, _viz_., those performed from desire of fruit and consequently productive of Return, and those not performed from desire of fruit and consequently leading to Emancipation. _Tena_ stands for _tena Yajnena_. What the speaker wishes to lay down is that only a certain class of sacrificers succeed in attaining to an end whence there is no return.

[^678]: 241:2 The sense seems to be that they perform mental Sacrifices, and not actual sacrifices after having created by Yoga-power all the necessary articles.

[^679]: 241:3 The sin of slaughtering a cow will not touch such a person, his soul being above the influence of acts.

[^680]: 241:4 _i.e._, I have for this reason spoken in praise of Renunciation and not that frame of mind in which one acts from desire of fruit.

[^681]: 241:5 These are, of course, the indications of complete Renunciation. Such a man never bends his head to another and never flatters another, for he is above all want.

[^682]: 241:6 Verse 35 is a triplet. In the first two lines the speaker says that one who does not accomplish the acts specified, fails to attain to a desirable end. In the last line, _idam_, refers to the duties of a true Brahmana or the indications of the Renunciation as laid down in verse 34. _Daivatam kritwa_, is explained by the commentator as _Daivatamiva sevaniyam kritwa_, _Yajnam_ is Vishnu or Brahma as the Srutis declare.

[^683]: 242:1 The Munis referred to in the first line are those mentioned in verse 31 above. They are the _atmayajins_ or mental sacrificers. _Kashtam_ is _gahanam_. _Asya_ in the second line refers to the particular _Yoga_ of those Munis. Lest the Yoga propounded by Tuladhara be regarded as altogether new, a circumstance that would detract from their merit, the commentator explains the words _natah_ as preceded by _Avekshamana api_ understood.

[^684]: 242:2 _Yasmin_ here is equivalent to _Yadi_, it being, as the commentator explains, _Vibhaktipratirupakam avyayam_. _Eva_ is equivalent to _Evam_, meaning _Twaduktaprakarena_; _atmatirtha_ means _atmaiva tirtham_ or _Yajnabhumistatra_. _Prapnuyat_ in the second line stands for _prapnuyuh_. The use of the singular for the plural is _arsha_.

[^685]: 242:3 What is said here is this: the sacrifices of some men become lost through absence of faith. These men, it is plain, are not worthy of performing any kind of sacrifice internal or external. The performance of sacrifice, however, is easy. The cow and her products can minister to all sacrifices. In the case of those that are able, full libations of clarified butter, of milk, and of curds, are sufficient to enable them to perform whatever sacrifice they wish. As regards those that are poor, the dust of a cow's hoof and the water in which a cow's tail and horns have been washed, are quite sufficient to enable them to perform their sacrifices. _Purnahuti_ should not, I think, be taken as different from clarified butter, etc.

[^686]: 242:4 All these verses are exceedingly terse. _Anena vidhina_ is the mode which the speaker himself advocates, _viz_., the performance of sacrifices without slaughter of animals. _Niyojayan_ is an instance _hetau satri_. After _prakaroti_ _Sraddham_ is understood. _Ishtam_ here means _Yagam_. _Yajunam_ (as in verse 35 above) is _Brahma_.

[^687]: 243:1 The soul is itself a _tirtha_. A _tirtha_, of course, is a spot containing sacred water. One should seek the acquisition of merit in the soul instead of going to places called sacred and lying in different parts of the earth. ‘According to his own ability’ means ‘according to the best of his power.’ If one can perform a sacrifice with clarified butter, one should not do it with the dust of a cow's hoofs.

[^688]: 243:2 _Dharmasya vachanat kila_ is explained by the commentator as _Dharmasya ahinsatmakasya samvandhino vachanat_. I think the words may also mean, ‘obeying the voice of Dharma.’

[^689]: 243:3 The two negatives in the second line amount to an affirmative assertion.

[^690]: 243:4 _Vaivaswati_ is ‘appertaining to Vivaswat or _prakasarapachidatma_’, hence '_Brahma-vishayini_. ‘Daughter of Surya’ means _Sattwiki_. Faith is _vahirvangamanasi_, _i.e._, is ‘the outward form of speech and mind,’ implying that it ‘transcends (the merit born of) speech (recitation) and mind (meditation).’

[^691]: 244:1 ‘Defects of speech’ are the incorrect utterance of _mantras_. ‘Defects of mind’ are such as listlessness, haste, etc.

[^692]: 244:2 _Kadarya_ is explained by the commentator as ‘miserly.’ I think it may be taken also in a more extended sense. Then again _vardhushi_ is a usurer and not necessarily a dealer in corn.

[^693]: 244:3 The commentator is entirely silent upon this verse. The two Bengali versions have proceeded in two different ways. The four classes of persons indicated in the previous verses are (1) he that is destitute of faith but is (outwardly) pure, (2) he that has faith but is not (outwardly) pure, (3) a miserly person possessed of learning, and (4) a usurer endued with liberality. The answer of Brahman, without touching other points, refers particularly to faith. The liberal man's food is sanctified by faith. The food of him that has no faith is lost. For this reason, the liberal man's food, even if he happens to be a usurer, is worthy of acceptance, and not so the food of the miser even though he may be possessed of Vedic lore.

[^694]: 245:1 The commentator takes the word _divam_ as implying _hardakasam_. They sported (not in the ordinary felicity of heaven but) in the puissance of Yoga.

[^695]: 245:2 _Gograhe_ is explained by the commentator as ‘a sacrifice in which kine are stain.’ _Yajnavatasya_ is an instance of the genitive for the accusative. It means _Yajnavatsthan nirdayan Brahmanan_. The expression may also mean ‘in the cow-pen within the sacrificial enclosure.’

[^696]: 245:3 _Avyaktaih_ is explained by the commentator as _Yajnadi-dwaraiva khyatimichchhadbhih_.

[^697]: 245:4 _Kamakara_ may also mean recklessness, _Vahirvedyam_ is ‘on the outer Vedi or altar.’ The actual slaughter takes place on this _vedi_. The Burdwan translator misunderstands the word.

[^698]: 246:1 _Upasya_, is explained by the commentator as ‘living near an inhabited place.’ _Vedakritah Srutih_ are the fruits indicated in the Vedas of the acts laid, down in them. _Acharah_ has reference to the duties of the domestic mode of life. _Acharah_ should be made _anacharah_, _i.e._, should not be followed. The Sannyasa mode of life is thus recommended.

[^699]: 246:2 The meaning is this: ordinary men abstain from tainted meat, regarding all meat as tainted which is obtained from animals that are not killed in sacrifices and in course of religious acts. The speaker, however, holds that this practise is not worthy of applause, for all meat is tainted, including that of animals slain in sacrifices. K.P. Singha gives the sense correctly though his rendering is not literal. The Burdwan translator, misunderstanding text and commentary, jumbles them together and gives an incorrect rendering.

[^700]: 246:3 Hence there is no need for sacrifices with slaughter of animals, and alcohol, etc.

[^701]: 246:4 The sense is this: dangers are always seeking to destroy the body. The body is always seeking to destroy those destroyers. This perpetual war or struggle implies the desire to injure. How then, asks Yudhishthira, is it possible for any man to lead a perfectly harmless life, harm being implied in the very fact of continued existence?

[^702]: 246:5 The sense, of course, is that one should acquire religious merit without wasting one's body; one should not, that is, cause one's body to be destroyed for the sake of earning merit.

[^703]: 247:1 On the occasion of the _Jata-karma_ the sire says ‘be thou as hard as adamant,’ ‘be thou an axe (unto all my foes).’ The _upakarma_ or subsidiary rite is performed on the occasion of p. 248 the _samavartana_ or return from the preceptor's abode. It is called subsidiary because it does not occur among the rites laid down in the Griha Sutras. The words uttered on that occasion are, ‘Thou art my own self, O Son.’

[^704]: 248:1 _Bhogya_ implies such articles as dress,—etc. _Bhojya_ implies food, etc. _Pravachana_ is instruction in the scriptures. _Garbhadhana_ is the ceremonial in connection with the attainment of puberty by the wife. _Simantonnayana_ is performed by the husband in the fourth, sixth or eighth month of gestation, the principal rite being the putting of the minimum mark on the head of the wife. The mark is put on the line of partition of her locks.

[^705]: 248:2 In India in every house two sticks were kept for producing fire by rubbing. These were replaced by the flint-stone and a piece of steel. Of course, Bryant and May's matches have now replaced those primitive arrangements almost everywhere, and in the hands of children have become a source of great danger to both life and property.

[^706]: 249:1 _Prana_ is the organ of generation. _Samslesha_ is union. The desires cherished are indicated in the Griha Sutras. ‘Let our child be fair of complexion.’ 'Let him be long-lived! Though both parents cherish such wishes, yet their fruition depends more on the mother than the father. This is a scientific truth.

[^707]: 249:2 The sense seems to be this. The mother only has correct knowledge of who the father is. The commands of the father, therefore, may be set aside on the ground of the suspicion that attaches to his very status as father. Then, again, if the father be adulterous, he should not be regarded on account of his sinfulness. Chirakarin asks, ‘How shall I know that Gautama is my father? How again shall I know that he is not sinful?’

[^708]: 249:3 The object of this verse is to indicate that when Gautama had ceased to protect his wife he had ceased to be her husband. His command, therefore, to slay her could not be obeyed.

[^709]: 249:4 The commentator argue that ‘man being the tempted, takes the guilt upon himself woman, being the tempted, escapes the guilt.’

[^710]: 250:1 The sense is this: the sire is all the deities together, for by reverencing the sire, all the deities are pleased. The mother, however, is all mortal and immortal creatures together, for by gratifying her one is sure to obtain success both here and hereafter.

[^711]: 250:2 _Dharmasya_ is explained by the commentator as _Yogadharma-sambandhi_. Probably, Gautama blames his own carelessness in not having provided, by Yoga-puissance, against the commission of the offence. The commentator observes that the _Rishi's_ exculpation of Indra himself is due to his own purity of nature and the entire absence of a desire to wrong other people. In reality, however, there can be no doubt that it was Indra who was to blame.

[^712]: 252:1 _i.e._, prince Satyavat said that the persons brought out for execution should not be executed. The power of kings did not extend over the lives of their subjects. In other words the prince argued against the propriety of inflicting capital punishment upon even grave offenders.

[^713]: 253:1 Verse 10 is a triplet.

[^714]: 253:2 The Burdwan translator gives a very incorrect version of this verse. He misunderstands both text and commentary completely. K.P. Singha is correct.

[^715]: 253:3 The commentator explains that the object of this line is to show that the very Sannyasin, when he offends, deserves to be chastised. K.P. Singha misunderstands the line completely. The Burdwan version is correct.

[^716]: 253:4 Both the vernacular versions of this verse are incorrect. The first half of the first line should be taken independently. The commentator explains that after _gariyamsam_ the words _api sasyu_ should be supplied. _Aparadhe tu punah punah_, etc., is said of offenders in general, and not eminent offenders only.

[^717]: 254:1 _i.e._, punishments were not necessary in former times, or very light ones were sufficient. The Burdwan version of this verse is thoroughly ridiculous.

[^718]: 254:2 Hence extermination is the punishment that has become desirable.

[^719]: 254:3 Hence, by slaying them no injury is done to any one in this or the other world.

[^720]: 254:4 _Padma_ means, the ornaments of corpses. Grave-stealers that were in every country. _Pisachat_ is _Pisachopahatat_. Evidently, idiots and mad men were the persons who were regarded to have been possessed by evil spirits. _Daiyatam_ is an accusative which, like, _Samayam_ is governed by the transitive verb _Kurvita_. _Yah kaschit_ means _yah kaschit mudyhah, na tu prajnah_. The Burdwan version of this verse shows that the person entrusted with this portion of the Canti was altogether incompetent for the task. K.P. Singha gives the meaning correctly.

[^721]: 254:5 The commentator supposes that after _sadhun_ the word _kartum_ is understood. The line may also be taken as meaning,—‘If thou dost not succeed in rescuing the honest without slaying (the wicked).’ _Bhuta bhavya_ is sacrifice. The prince speaks of exterminating the rogues by slaying them as animals in a sacrifice because of the declaration in the _Srutis_ that those killed in sacrifices ascend to heaven, purged of all their sins. Such acts, therefore, seem to be merciful to the prince, compared to death by hanging or on the block.

[^722]: 255:1 The world thus improves in conduct and morality through the king only behaving in a proper way. Cruel punishments are scarcely needed to reform the world.

[^723]: 255:2 The period of human life decreases proportionately in every succeeding age, as also the strength of human beings. In awarding punishments, the king should be guided by these considerations.

[^724]: 255:3 The word _satya_ is used here for Emancipation. _Mahaddahrmaphalam_ is true knowledge, so called because, of its superiority to heaven, etc. The way pointed out by Manu is, of p. 256 course, the religion of harmlessness. In verse 35, there is an address to prince Satyavat. It seems, as I have pointed out, that verses 32 to 35 represent the words of the grandsire to whom the prince refers in verse 31.

[^725]: 256:1 The redundant syllable is _arsha_.

[^726]: 256:2 Both acts and knowledge have been pointed out in the Vedas. The Vedas, therefore, being authority for both, one or the other cannot be censured or applauded.

[^727]: 256:3 _Arsha_ means here Vedic injunctions declared through the mouths of inspired _Rishis_ and compiled by _Rishis_. _Viditatmanah_ is the Supreme Being himself. The object of the speaker is to show that no part of the Vedas can be censured, for every word in them is equally authoritative, all being God's own.

[^728]: 257:1 _Deva-yanah_ is explained by the commentator as _Devam atmanam janti ebhiriti_, _i.e._, those by which the Soul is reached. The relative strength or weakness of the four modes of life hath been thus indicated. The Sannyasin attains to _Moksha_ or Emancipation; the forest recluse to the region of Brahman; the house-holder attains to heaven (region of the deities presided over by Indra) and the Brahmacharin attains to the region of the _Rishis_.

[^729]: 257:2 The commentator explains that having commenced with the assertion that men should sacrifice from desire of heaven, the speaker fears that the hearer may deny the very existence of heaven. Hence, he takes a surer ground for justifying slaughter, _viz_., the ground that is connected with the consideration of food. Living creatures must eat in order to live. The very support of life requires the slaughter of life. Slaughter, therefore, is justified by the highest necessity.

[^730]: 257:3 _i.e._, there are the essential requisites of sacrifice.

[^731]: 257:4 The seven domestic animals are cow, goat, man, horse, sheep, mule, and ass. The seven wild ones are lion, tiger, boar, buffalo, elephant, bear, and monkey.

[^732]: 257:5 '_Vichinwita_ is _Vivechayet_ with _alamvartham_ understood: _atmanah_ is equivalent to _jivat_.

[^733]: 258:1 All the products of the cow that are named here are not required in all sacrifices. Some are required in some, others in others. Those then that _are_ required, when coupled with Ritwijas and Dakshina, complete the respective sacrifices or uphold or sustain them.

[^734]: 258:2 _Samhritya_ means _Ekikritya_ and not ‘destroying’ as the Burdwan translator wrongly takes it.

[^735]: 258:3 The Burdwan translator, notwithstanding the clear language of both the text and commentary, wrongly connects the first line of verse 31 with the last line of 30, and makes nonsense of both verses.

[^736]: 258:4 By taking the two lines of 32 with the last line of 30, the Burdwan translator makes nonsense of the passage.

[^737]: 258:5 ‘Brahmanas’ here means that part of the Vedas which contains the ritual.

[^738]: 258:6 Each constitutes the refuge of the other.

[^739]: 259:1 There are many such expletives, such as _hayi_, _havu_, etc.

[^740]: 259:2 For, as the commentator explains, one who has acquired an empire does not seek the dole of charity. In view of the high end that Renunciation is certain to bring, what need has a person of the domestic mode of life which leads to rewards that are insignificant compared to the other.

[^741]: 260:1 Varhi is grass or straw. _Oshadhi_ here implies paddy and other grain. _Vahiranya adrija_ implies ‘other kinds of _Oshadhi_ born on mountains,’ _i.e._, the Soma and other useful hill plants and shrubs. _Teshamapi mulam garhastyam_ should be supplied after the first line. Domesticity is the root of these, because these are cultivated or collected by persons leading the domestic mode of life. The argument in the second line is this: _Oschadhibhyah pranah, pranat vahihna kinchit drisyate, atah viswasyapi mulam garhastyam_.

[^742]: 260:2 Literally rendered, the words are,—‘Without doubt, Vedic _mantras_ enter into persons of the regenerate classes in respect of acts whose effects are seen and acts whose effects instead of being seen depend upon the evidence of the scriptures.’ Practically, what is said here is that all the acts of a Brahmana are performed with the aid of Vedic _mantras_.

[^743]: 260:3 Mantras are necessary in cremating a Brahmana's dead body. _Mantras_ are needed for assisting the dead spirit to attain to a brilliant form (either in the next world or in this if there p. 261 be rebirth). These _mantras_ are, of course, uttered in _Sraddhas_. After the dead spirit has been provided, with the aid of _mantras_, with a body, food and drink are offered to him with the aid of _mantras_. Kine and animals are given away by the representatives of the dead for enabling the dead ancestor to cross the Vaitarani (the river that flows between the two worlds) and for enabling him to become happy in heaven. The funeral cake, again, according to the ordinance, is sunk in water for making it easily attainable by him to whom it is offered. By becoming a human being one inherits three debts. By study he pays off his debt to the _Rishis_: by the performance of sacrifices he pays off his debt to the gods, and by begetting children he frees himself from the debt he owes to the _Pitris_. The argument then is this: when the Vedas, which are the words of Supreme Godhead, have laid down these _mantras_ for the attainment of such objects in the next world, how can Emancipation, which involves an incorporeal existence transcending the very _Karana_ (form) be possible? The very declarations of the Vedas in favour of acts are inconsistent with incorporeal existence or with the negation of existence with dual consciousness of knower and known.

[^744]: 261:1 The mention of ‘Devan’ as the commentator points out—_Rishis_ and also _Pitris_. The _amrita_ here that these covet is, of course, the Sacrificial libation. ‘Brahma-sanjnitah’ implies ‘conversant with Brahma,’ for the _Srutis_ say that ‘Brahmavid Brahmaiva bhavati.’

[^745]: 261:2 The terseness of the original has not been removed in the translation. _Enam_ is the universal Soul dwelling within this physical frame. It refers to the person who constitutes himself to be the soul of all creatures or one who is conversant with _Brahma_ or has become _Brahma_ itself. That soul is said to have a fourfold nature, _viz._, it is _virat_ (all-embracing), _sutra_ (fine as the finest thread and pervading everything), _antaryamin_ (possessed of omniscience), and _suddha_ (stainless). Its four mouths, by which are meant the four sources of enjoyment or pleasure, are the body, the senses, the mind, and the understanding. What the p. 262 speaker wishes to point out by this is the _Bhotkritwa_ (power of enjoyment) of the Soul. The _Kartritwa_ (power of action) is then pointed out by the mention of the doors which are the two arms, the organ of speech, the stomach and the organ of the pleasure (generation). These last operate as doors for shutting or confining the soul within its chamber. They are the screens or _avaranas_ that conceal its real nature. The very gods feel their force, being unable to transcend them or their demands. He who would transcend them and shine in his own stainless nature should seek to control or restrain them. Practically, it is Yoga that is recommended for enabling one to attain to the position of the universal Soul.

[^746]: 262:1 ‘One who has cast off his upper garment’ is one who clothes himself very scantily only for the sake of decency and not for splendour.

[^747]: 262:2 _Dwandwarama_ very likely means here the joys of wedded couples and not ‘the pleasures derived from pairs of opposites’. The sense seems to be this that man is a Brahmana who, without marrying succeeds in enjoying singly all the felicity that attaches to married life.

[^748]: 262:3 In reality all things are, of course, _Brahma_. Their external aspects are only transformations. p. 263 The end of all creatures is death and rebirth till absorption takes place into _Brahma_ by means of Yoga.

[^749]: 263:1 The original is very terse. I have expanded it, following the commentator. _Dana-yajna kriya phalam_ is _chitta suddhi_ of purity or heart; _antarena_ is equivalent to _vina_; _anujananti_ governs _Brahmanyam_ understood. _Anyat phalam_ in the second line implies heaven and its joys (which satisfy ordinary men). The practice _anu_ before _jananti_ is taken to imply _gurum anu_, _i.e._, following the instructions of preceptors.’

[^750]: 263:2 These three verses run together and are extremely abstruse. There can be no doubt that the commentator is right. The construction is this: _Yam sadacharam asritya samsritanam swakarmabhih_ (sahitam) _tapah ghoratwam agatam, tam_ (_sadacharam_) _puranam puranam saswatam dhruvam dharmeshu cha sutritamkitichit charitum asaknuvantah phalavanti vyushtimanti dhruvam cha karmani_ (_mudah_) _vigunani_, etc., _pasyanti_. The second line of 36 stands by itself as an explanatory sentence referring to some of the characteristics of the _sadachara_ that is spoken of. _Samsritanam_, refers to men observing the different modes of life; _ghoratwam agatam_ is _samsarandhakaranasakam bhavati_. What is meant by this is that the penances of such men, along with the duties they are called upon to observe by the particular mode of life they follow, become a terrible weapon, in consequence of their _sadacharah_, for destroying the evils of worldliness. The _sadacharah_ spoken of here is _nishkamadharmah_. The latter is no new-fangled theory of men of learning but is _puranam saswatam_, and _dhruvam_. The _phalavanti vyushtimanti_, and _dhruva karmani_ which fools regard to be _vigyunani_ and _anaikatitikani_ are, of course, those acts which are included within the word ‘Yoga.’ In brief, the speaker, in these three verses, wishes to inculcate that wise men, whatever their mode of life, observe its duties. But by virtue of the _nishkama dharma_ they follow, they convert those duties and their penances into efficient means for dispelling the darkness of ignorance. Fools, on the other hand, unable to practise that _nishkama dharma_, look upon it and Yoga itself as fruitless and valueless although the rewards these confer are visible.

[^751]: 264:1 The sciences that have disputation only for their foremost object, are, according to the commentator, the sciences of the Lokayatikas, the Saughatas (or Buddhists), the Kapalikas, etc. The other sciences based on Logic that are included within the word Agama are the two Mimamsas, Sankhya, and Patanjala.

[^752]: 265:1 _Aikatmyam_ is explained by the commentator as _Eka eva dwaita darsana hina atma yatra bhavati_. Practically, it is that state of the mind in which one perceives one's identity with everything in the universe. This is that true knowledge which brings about Emancipation or is Emancipation itself.

[^753]: 265:2 They are called ‘robbers of the scriptures’ because they always seek to rob the scriptures of their true meaning. They are ‘depredators of _Brahma_’ because they deny the very existence of Godhead. _Nirarambhah_ is _Camadyarambha-sunyah_.

[^754]: 265:3 The particle _anu_ means ‘following the instructions of preceptors.’ _Samyame_ refers to _Dharana_, _Dhyana_ and _Samadhi_. Some texts read _Siddhante_ for _samyame_.

[^755]: 266:1 What is intended to be said here is that only a life of Renunciation, so hard to follow, can lead to Emancipation. The Burdwan translator makes nonsense of the second line of 64 by connecting it with the first line of 65, K.P. Singha omits it entirely.

[^756]: 267:1 The Vedas are _Savda-Brahma_ or Brahma as represented by sound.

[^757]: 267:2 I have expanded this verse, following the lead of the commentator. Some idea may be given of the extreme terseness of such verses by offering a literal rendering: ‘That lump of matter which is made a (human) body by what is contained in the Veda, is (afterwards) made (a body by the same means).’ One approaches one's wife after performing the rite of _Garbhadhana_. In this rite, different deities are invoked to develop different organs and parts of the body of the child to be begotten. Thus begotten, the body of the child is, subsequent to birth, cleansed or purified. All this requires the aid of the Vedic _mantras_. What Kapila wishes to teach is that commencing with acts, knowledge should finally be acquired.

[^758]: 267:3 Yoga is the only way to true knowledge, hence _Jnana-nishthah_ is _Yoga-nishthah_.

[^759]: 267:4 These and men like these are pointed out as persons deserving of gifts.

[^760]: 267:5 _i.e._, in Brahma as possessed of attributes and as freed from attributes.

[^761]: 268:1 _Matra_ is explained as _miyante vishya anya_ _i.e._, the understanding. What is meant by guile in the practice of righteousness may be exemplified as follows. Individual grains of barley may be given away instead of cloths by one unable to obtain clothes for gift. But one giving away barley grains when perfectly able to give away clothes would be guilty of guile.

[^762]: 268:2 The scriptures frequently lay down ordinances in the alternative. The absolute or substantive provisions are for the able. Those in the alternative are for them that are unable.

[^763]: 268:3 What is meant by the sacrifices, etc., of such men being identical with infinite Brahma is that these men were identical with Brahma and whatever they did was Brahma. They had no consciousness of self, or they did nothing for self. They were the Soul of the universe.

[^764]: 269:1 What is said here in effect is that at first there was only one course of duties, called _sadachara_ or good conduct, for all men. In progress of time men became unable to obey all its dictates in their entirety. It then became necessary to distribute those duties into four subdivisions corresponding with the four modes of life.

[^765]: 269:2 Both K.P. Singha and the Burdwan translator have completely misunderstood verse 23 and the first line of 24, which, as the commentator explains, should be construed together. The construction is _Tam_ (sadacharam) _santah grihebhyah nishkramya eva_ (sannyasam kritwaiva) _vidhivatprapya paramam gatim gachcchanti. Anye santo vanamasritah tam vidhivat prapya_, _etc_. Similarly, _Grihameva bhisamsritya anye santah_, etc.’ _Jato-anye_, etc. Thus, all the four modes, commencing with the last, are spoken of.

[^766]: 269:3 It is impossible for any one to read the Burdwan version of such verses without pitying the Pandit responsible for its accuracy. Without understanding the commentary in the least, the words of the great commentator have been reproduced in the Burdwan version in a strange order, rejecting some of the connecting links without any excuse, and making the Collocation utterly unintelligible. K.P. Singha gives the substance very briefly without endeavouring to translate the words. And yet the verse presents almost no difficulty. The last line of 29 and the first line of 30 make one sentence. _Chaturthopanishaddharmah_ is explained by the commentator as implying _paramatma-vishayini vidya, tadartham dharmah_. There p. 270 are four states of consciousness: 1st, wakefulness; 2nd, dream; 3rd, dreamless slumber (sushupti); and 4th, _Turiya_, which is reached by _Samadhi_ (abstraction of Yoga-meditation), and in which _Brahma_ becomes realisable. What is said in these two lines is simply this: the duties (dharmah), relating to the _Chaturthopanishat_ or, the Knowledge of Paramatman, are _sadharanah_ or common to all the four orders of men and modes of life. Those duties, of course, are _sama_, _dama_, _uparama_, _titiksha_, _sraddha_, _samadhi_. What is said in the last line of 30 is that Brahmanas of pure hearts and restrained souls always succeed (by the help of those duties) in acquiring or attaining to that _Turiya_ or consciousness of _Brahma_.

[^767]: 270:1 _Apavargamiti_ is explained by the commentator as _apavargaprada vidya_ or _Brahmasakshatkararupa vrittiryasmin iti_. _Nityin_ is _avasyakah_. _Yatidharmah_ is a life of Renunciation. What is meant by _sanatanah_ is _sampradayagatah_.

[^768]: 270:2 _Sadharana_ is opposed to _kevala_. _Yathavalam_ implies _yathavaira-gyam_, _Gachcchatam Gachcchatam_ means _purushamatrasyavanigvya-dhadeh_. The Burdwan translator misses the sense altogether and K.P. Singha quietly passes over the entire second line of this triplet. _Durvala_ means he who is wanting in _vairagya_.

[^769]: 270:3 The commentator explains that the object of this verse is to show that even if there be equality in respect of the end that is attained in next life, there is more of real felicity in a life of Renunciation than in a life of enjoyment. The Burdwan translator misses the sense entirely.

[^770]: 270:4 The Burdwan translator gives a very erroneous version of this verse.

[^771]: 270:5 For by Knowledge Emancipation is obtained.

[^772]: 271:1 _Vatarechaka_ is _bhastra_ or a bellows. What is implied is, perhaps, that such a man breathes or lives in vain.

[^773]: 271:2 _Nasti_ is explained by the commentator as the past and the future. _Nishtha_ is _swarupam_. Literally, what is said is that everything is the Vedas, or the Vedas are everything, This is, perhaps, only an exaggerated mode of saying that the Vedas deal with everything.

[^774]: 271:3 The sense seems to be that while they that are ignorant regard the universe to be as existent and durable as the thunder or adamant, the man of knowledge regards it to be truly non-existent though it puts forth the appearance of existence.

[^775]: 271:4 I have endeavoured to give a literal version of verse 45. It is difficult, however, to seize the meaning from such versions. The word used in the first line is _Tyaga_ implying Renunciation. The commentator correctly explains that this is that complete Renunciation which takes place in _Samadhi_ or the perfect abstraction of Yoga. _Samaptam_ is _samyak aptam_ (_bhavati_). This _samyak_ is _Brahma_. Similarly, _santosha_ is not ordinary contentment but _Brahmananda_ or the _Supreme felicity_ of one who has attained to _Brahma_. The meaning, then, is this: in the complete abstraction of Yoga (_i.e._, Samadhi) is _Brahma_. This all the Vedas teach. In Emancipation again is the Supreme felicity of _Brahma_. _Apavargah_ is not annihilation but Emancipation, which is existence in _Brahma_ without the dual consciousness of knower and known.

[^776]: 271:5 I have followed the commentator in his exposition of almost all the adjectives in the text.

[^777]: 272:1 The grammatical construction of this verse is very difficult to catch. There can be no doubt that the commentator is right. Tehjah, _kshama_, _santih_,—these are _anamayam subham_, _i.e._, _nirdukhasya sukhasyapraptau hetuh_. _Tatha_, separates these from what follows. _Abidham Vyoma Santanam_, and _dhruvam_ are governed by _gamyate_, _Etaih sarvaih_ refers to _Tejah_ and the two others. _Abidham_ is explained as _akittrimam_; _vyoma_ as _jagatkaranam_. The Burdwan translator gives a correct version, although his punctuation is incorrect. He errs, however, in not taking _anamayam subham_ as one and the same. K.P. Singha errs in connecting _anamayam_ with what follows _tatha_.

[^778]: 273:1 _Nishkriti_ is literally escape. There is escape for those referred to; of course, the escape is to be sought by expiation. There is none for an ingrate, for ingratitude is inexpiable.

[^779]: 273:2 _Asubheshu_ is explained as _asubheshu karmashu upasthiteshu_.

[^780]: 274:1 The Brahman evidently refers to the indifference of Kundadhara towards him. He had thought that Kundadhara would, in return for his adorations, grant him wealth. Disappointed in this, he says, when Kundadhara does not mind my adorations, who else will? I had, therefore, better give up all desire for wealth and retire into the woods. The passage, however, seems to be inconsistent with the Brahmana's indifference to the fine fabrics of cloth lying around him.

[^781]: 274:2 Persons who have won ascetic success utter a wish and it is immediately fulfilled. ‘I give thee this,’ and forthwith what is given in words appears bodily, ready to be taken and appropriated. The words of such persons do not follow their meanings, but meanings follow their words.

[^782]: 275:1 The Burdwan translator makes nonsense of this verse. He forgets his grammar so completely as to take _etaih_ as qualifying _lokah_.

[^783]: 275:2 The verse is not difficult; the commentator, again, is very clear. The Burdwan translator, however, while citing the very words of the commentary, totally misunderstands them and makes utter nonsense of them. _Ekarthanam_ is explained as _Ekam chitiasuddhih Iswarapritirva tadarthanam madhya_. The question asked is _dharmartham yo yajnah samahitah_ (_viniyuktah_) _tadeva vruhi_ and not that _Yajna_ which _sukhartham_ (_bhavati_).

[^784]: 276:1 One that subsists upon grains of corn picked up from the fields after the reapers have abandoned them is called a person leading the _unchha_ mode of life. The Burdwan translator commits the ridiculous error of taking _unchhavrittih_ as the _name_ of the Brahmana. The commentator supposes that _Yajna_ here implies _Vishnu_, as expounded in the _Srutis_.

[^785]: 276:2 Syamaka is a variety of paddy called _Panicum frumentaceum_. ‘Suryaparni’ is otherwise called ‘Mashaparni’ (_Ayurvedhartha chandrika_). It is identified with _Tiramus labialis_, syn.—_Glycine deblis_. ‘Suvarchala’ is a name applied to various plants. Here, very probably, ‘_Brahmisaka_,’ or _Herpestes Monnjera_ (syn.—_Gratiola Monniera_, Linn) is intended.

[^786]: 276:3 _i.e._, he never slaughtered living animals for offering them in sacrifices because of his inability to procure them. He, therefore, substituted vegetable products for those animals. His sacrifices, intended to take him to heaven, were really cruel in intention.

[^787]: 276:4 Following the Bombay text I read the last line of 8 as _Sukrasya punarajatih Parnadonamadharmavit_, or _Sukrasya punarjnabhih_, etc.; _ajatih_ is a ‘descendant.’ If _ajnabhih_ be taken as the reading it would mean ‘at the repeated commands of Sukra.’ The Bengal reading _apadhyanat adharmavit_ seems to be vicious. Both the vernacular versions are incorrect; K.P. Singha supplying something of his own will for making sense of what, he writes, and the Burdwan translator writing nonsense as usual.

[^788]: 277:1 K.P. Singha wrongly translates this verse; for once, the Burdwan translator is correct.

[^789]: 277:2 Both the vernacular versions of this verse were incorrect. The commentator explains that the grammar is _rasatalam didrikshuh sa Yajna-pavakam pravishtah_. _Yajne duscharitam kinnu, samipavarti mudo janah_ _i.e._, fearing to see many other defects in the sacrifice which was being celebrated by an ignorant person.

[^790]: 277:3 _Vaddhanjalim_ is an adverb, qualifying _ayachata_. The Burdwan translator wrongly takes it as an adjective of _Satyam_.

[^791]: 277:4 In verse 8, it is said that it was a descendant of Sukra, _viz_., the virtuous Parnada, who had become a deer and lived in those woods as the Brahmana's neighbour. Here it is said that it was the deity Dharma who had become so. The two statements may be reconciled supposing that Dharma first became the _Rishi_ Parnada and then, as Parnada, was metamorphosed into a deer. _Tasya nishkritim adhatta_ is explained by the commentator in a very far-fetched way. He takes these words to mean that Dharma, who had become a deer, provided at this juncture for his liberation from that metamorphosis. I think _tasya_ has reference to the misled Brahmana.

[^792]: 277:5 _Yajnia_ is explained as _yajnaya hita_.

[^793]: 277:6 _Samadhanam_ is the absorption of meditation, or that state of mind in which one has no longer any affection for the world, _Bharyayh_ is genitive, but the Burdwan translator takes it for the instrumental singular.

[^794]: 278:1 _Yo dhamah_ is the reading I take, and not _no dharmah_.

[^795]: 278:2 The commentator explains the grammar as _panchanam_ (madhya ekam) _artham prapya_, etc.

[^796]: 279:1 This is the mastery or puissance that is brought by Yoga, so that the person succeeds, flats of the will, in creating whatever he desires.

[^797]: 279:2 The Burdwan translator gives a ridiculous version of this verse. He cites the commentator's words without understanding them aright.

[^798]: 279:3 What he does is to abandon _sakamah dharmah_ for betaking himself to _nishaamah dharmah_ or the practice of duties without desire of fruit, for only such a course of conduct can lead to Emancipation.

[^799]: 279:4 By _dharma_ here is meant _nishkama dharma_, for the fruits of _sakama dharma_ are not eternal, heaven like all things else having an end.

[^800]: 280:1 What is said in this verse is this: when a man wants an earthen jar, he works for creating one. When he has got one, he no longer finds himself in the same state of mind, his want having been satisfied. Similarly, with men desirous of heaven and earthly prosperity as the reward of virtue, the means is _Pravritti_ or acts. This or these cease to operate with those who having acquired such virtue set themselves for the achievement of Emancipation, for with them the religion of _Nivritti_ is all in all.

[^801]: 280:2 _i.e._, by abandoning all kinds of idleness, as explained by the commentator.

[^802]: 280:3 _i.e._, by Yoga-meditation one should regulate and finally suspend one's breath. The Yogin can suspend all physical functions and yet live on from age to age.

[^803]: 280:4 _Nidra_ here is explained as _ananusandhana_ or the absence of inquisitiveness or curiosity. By _pratibha_ is meant inquiry after improper things or things that are of no interest.

[^804]: 280:5 The truth is that the world is unreal and has no end.

[^805]: 280:6 Hunger is to be subdued by Yoga, _i.e._, by regulating the wind within the body. Doubt is to be dispelled by certainty; this implies that certain knowledge should be sought for by driving off doubt. The commentator thinks that this means that all sceptical conclusions should be dispelled by faith in the scriptures. By ‘fear,’ in this verse, is meant the source p. 281 of fear, or the world. That is to be conquered by the conquest of the six, _i.e._, desire, wrath, covetousness, error, pride, and envy.

[^806]: 281:1 What is laid down here is the same course of training that is indicated for Yoga. First, the senses are to be merged into the mind, then the mind is to be merged into the Understanding, then the Understanding is to be merged into the Soul or what is known as the Ego. This Ego is to be merged at last into the Supreme Soul. When the Ego is understood, it comes to be viewed as _Brahma_.

[^807]: 281:2 ‘Pure acts’ are, of course, those that are included in ‘Nishkama dharmah,’ and ‘tranquillity of soul’ is the cleansing of the soul by driving away all passions and desires.

[^808]: 281:3 Such restraint of speech, etc., or _niyamah_ is _yogah_. _Kamaoanyatha_ is _kama-vaiparityena_. The sense, the commentator adds, is that one should not desire ‘yoga-siddhi,’ for then, as has been repeatedly indicated in the previous Sections, the Yogin would fall into hell and succeed not in attaining to Emancipation, heaven itself being hell in comparison with the felicity of Emancipation. K.P. Singha quietly skips over the last line and the Burdwan translator offers a ridiculously incorrect version.

[^809]: 282:1 _Yebhyah_ means 'the materials from which. (_Srijati_) has _Paramatma_ for its nominative (understood). _Kale_ is the time of creation as selected by the Supreme Soul in his own wisdom. _Bhavaprachoditah_ is ‘induced by the desire of becoming many, or led by the desire of existence as many or in infinite diversity.’

[^810]: 282:2 _Kala_ here is, perhaps, the embodiment of the abstract idea of life of living creatures. Impelled by the Understanding, _Kala_ or life sets itself to the creation of other creatures. These last also are equally the result of the same five primal essences.

[^811]: 282:3 The construction of the second line is this: _etan shad abhinivrittan_ (_sarveshu karyeshu anugatam_) _vettha_; then _ete yasya rasayah_ (_karyani, tat asat_). The sense of the last clause is that all this is the effect of those primal essences. All this, therefore, is of those essences. The latter are included in the word _asat_, or unreal, as distinguished from _sat_ or real of substantial. The soul is _sat_, everything else is _asat_.

[^812]: 282:4 In previous Sections it has been explained how when the Chit, which has pure knowledge for its attribute, becomes invested with Ignorance, it begins to attract the primal essences towards itself in consequence of the potencies of past acts and take birth in various shapes. (The idea of past acts is due to the infinite cycles of creation and destruction, the very first creation being inconceivable). The causes of creation are, therefore, the five primal essences, Jiva (or _chit_), the potencies of past acts, and Ignorance.

[^813]: 283:1 _Jnanani_ is _Jnana-karanani_, _i.e._, perceptions for causes of perception.

[^814]: 283:2 The second line of 13 is very condensed. The meaning is this: the eye is the sense of vision. Vision or sight is its function. The object it apprehends is form. The eye has light for its cause, and form is an attribute of light. Hence the eye seizes or apprehends form. By the inference of reason, there is similitude, in respect of attribute or property, between the eye, vision, and form. The commentator explains this clearly _Drashtri-darsanadrisya nam trayanamapi gunatamatyam upapannam_. This is indicated with a little variation in the next verse. K.P. Singha skips over the line. The Burdwan translator gives an incorrect version.

[^815]: 283:3 _Manas_ is mind, _Buddhi_ is Understanding, and _Kshetrajna_ is the Soul. What, however, is _Chitta_ is difficult to ascertain, unless it means vague or indefinite perception. In some systems of philosophy the Chitta is placed above the Understanding.

[^816]: 283:4 The Bengal reading _yathagantam_ is preferable to the Bombay reading _yatha mama_.

[^817]: 284:1 The first line of 27 is grammatically connected with the last line of 26. The second line of 27 is very abstruse. The grammatical construction is this: _tayorbhavayogamanam_ (_sushuptau_) _pratyaksham_ (_drishtam_); (_tadeva_) _nityam_, _ipsitam_ (_cha_). What is meant by this is that in ordinary men, the notions during wakefulness are not the notions they cherish during dreams: nor are their notions during dreams identifiable with those they entertain while wakeful. There is similarity but not identity. In eternal Sushupti, however, which is Emancipation, the notions of wakefulness pass into those of dream and those of dream pass into those of wakefulness, _i.e._, both (or, rather, the same, for there is then perfect identity between them) become directly apprehensible in Sushupti or Emancipation. Sushupti Or Emancipation, therefore, is a state, in which there is neither the consciousness of wakefulness nor that of dream, but both run together, their differences disappearing totally.

[^818]: 284:2 This is a triplet.

[^819]: 285:1 _Brahmabhava_ is explained as follows: when one succeeds in understanding Brahma, one is said to attain to Brahma, as the _Srutis_ declare. The commentator explains that Pasyanti is used with reference to those that are learned in the scriptures. They behold the attainment of the highest end by Jiva _not_ with their physical eyes but with the eye of the scriptures, for they that are themselves emancipated cannot be said to behold the emancipation of another. This is grave trifling for explaining the use of the word _pasyanti_.

[^820]: 285:2 The commentator points out that possessions of value include even the region of Brahman. Men of knowledge, who seek Emancipation, do not set any value on even the joy of the region of the Creator.

[^821]: 286:1 The commentator explains that one should not cherish 'the desire for wealth even for the sake of acquiring virtue therewith. When, however, wealth is obtained without effort, such wealth should be applied to the acquisition of virtue. One is also directed to give up the desire of acquiring wealth (by even innocent means) the reason being that desire, when cherished, is sure to increase and get the better of one's heart.

[^822]: 286:2 The commentator observes that the first line means that the man of knowledge should wish for happiness to all, and never wish sorrow to any one. _Sarvam_ includes virtue and vice. Of course, the practice of _nishkama dharma_ is recommended.

[^823]: 287:1 All Brahmanas have to pluck flowers in the morning for offering them to the deities they worship. The task takes many minutes, because a good many have to be plucked for the purpose. This being a daily occupation and they going as they do to places where flowers abound, the act of plucking goes on while the plucker is mentally engaged with other things.

[^824]: 287:2 The Bengal reading _sputam vyaghro mrigamiva_, etc. is preferable to the Bombay reading _sputam vyaghram mahaughova_. If the Bombay reading be accepted, the meaning would be ‘Him Death snatches away _as a mighty wave sweeps away a sleeping tiger_.’ The idea of a sleeping tiger being swept away by a surging wave is very unfamiliar.

[^825]: 288:1 Devas here evidently refer to the senses. The senses are, as it were, cattle. Their true fold is the forest and not peopled cities and towns. In the forest there are no temptations to try them as in the midst of cities and towns.

[^826]: 288:2 _Jivitarthapanayenaih_ is connected with _hinsati_. To take it (as the Burdwan translator does) as an adjective qualifying ‘pranibhih’ would be incorrect.

[^827]: 288:3 The Sacrifice of Peace is opposed to the Sacrifice of Slaughter. The Sacrifice of Brahma is Yoga which leads to a knowledge of the Soul. The Sacrifice of Speech is Vedic recitation or Japa. The Sacrifice of Mind is contemplation, and that of Acts is baths, performance of other acts of purity, waiting dutifully upon the preceptor, etc.

[^828]: 289:1 To perform the Sacrifice of Self is to merge the Soul in the Supreme Soul.

[^829]: 289:2 The Bombay reading _danda-vidhanam_ is a blunder for the Bengal reading _danda nidhanam_. To interpret vidhanam as equivalent to abandonment or giving up, by taking the prefix _vi_, in the sense of _vigata_ would be an act of violence to the word.

[^830]: 289:3 The _guha_ or cave referred to is the body.

[^831]: 289:4 By _Prakriti_, as explained in previous Sections, is meant primal nature consisting of the five great essences of earth, water, etc.

[^832]: 289:5 _Samupodeshu_ is explained as _upasthiteshu api_, _i.e._, even when such objects are present and ready for enjoyment.

[^833]: 290:1 _Maitrayangatah_, as explained by the commentator, is _Suryavat-pratyaha-vibhinna-margah_, _i.e._, roving like the Sun every day in a different path. The object of the speaker is to lay it down that one solicitous of Emancipation should never confine oneself to one spot, but rove or wander over the world without owning a fixed habitation or home. K.P. Singha translates the word wrongly.

[^834]: 290:2 In the first line, the Bengal reading _madhya na chacharet_ is better than _madhya cha nacharet_. _Pradakshinam_ is _ankulam_, and _savyam_ is _pratikulam_. The grammar of the second line is not difficult. Besides, the commentator explains it clearly. The Burdwan translator, leaving out the words _bhaikshacharyam_ and taking _anapannah_ as equivalent to _vipadapannah_, gives a thoroughly ridiculous version. K.P. Singha, also, is not correct. The commentator explains that _charyam_ means _anekagrihatanam_; _anapannam_ is _akurvan_. The second foot is unconnected with the first.

[^835]: 290:3 _Muni_, here, is one who has restrained his senses, or who has betaken himself to the path of Renunciation. _Patrasamchara_, I think, is the act of setting the dishes for those who are to dine off them. The commentator explains that it means ‘the motion of those who are to distribute the food.’ Of course, their motions from the kitchen to the dining hall and back are implied if the word is taken for ‘setting of dishes.’ The sense remains unaltered. The _Muni_ must be abstemious and hence he should select an hour like this for begging his dole, when there would be very little in the house to give.

[^836]: 290:4 _Matra_ is a technical word signifying the taking of food to the extent of only gratification of hunger, or, as explained by Chakrapani Datta in his commentary on _Charaka, triptimatram_. When _matra_ is to be disregarded, clothes, etc., need not be mentioned. _Vihanyeta_ is equivalent to _hinsito na syat_.

[^837]: 291:1 The second line is passed over by K.P. Singha. What is meant by it is that when such a man is respectfully presented with anything, he should hold it in reprobation. _Vide_ the Sanatsujatiya Sections in _Udyoga Parva_, particularly the verses beginning with _Yatra akathayamanasya_, etc.

[^838]: 291:2 The second line is skipped over by K.P. Singha. The Burdwan translator gives a wrong version. The commentator explains that _anyam_ refers to _paisachim_, and _anyatra_ to _atmani_. In the Sanatsujatiya Sections also, a Brahmana's practices are directed to be concealed. ‘To enter his own Self’ is to turn self on Self, _i.e._, to withdraw oneself from everything for understanding and contemplating the Soul.

[^839]: 291:3 By totally abstaining from acts he should avoid both merit and demerit.

[^840]: 291:4 This is a triplet. The Burdwan translator misses the meaning of the first half of the first line. The commentator explains that _abhayastam_ is continuous; _bhautikam_ is _tattwajatam_, _atmanodehendriyadi_. Hence, _bhutanam_ means _anyesham bhutanam_.

[^841]: 291:5 To think beforehand of the food one is to take is to convert oneself into gourmand. The Sannyasin, without thinking of the food he would take, and without mentally indulging in a foretaste thereof should take what he gets without exertion.

[^842]: 292:1 _Sanjnakam_ from the root _jna_ meaning _marana_ or killing.

[^843]: 292:2 The two negatives in the first line are equivalent to an affirmative. _Prasangatah_ is explained by the commentator in a slightly different way. Affluence, in consequence of the attachment it generates, stands in the way of Emancipation. Hence, _i.e._, in consequence of this consideration, the king's opinion regarding affluence, is correct. With respect to the certainty of attaining to Emancipation, compare _Gita_, _Vahunam janmanamante jnanavan mam prapadyate_, etc.

[^844]: 293:1 The object of this verse, as explained by the commentator, is to exhort Yudhishthira to strive after Emancipation without being at all moved by his happiness or misery which (as stated here) come to _Jiva_ as accidents.

[^845]: 293:2 The wind has space for its progenitor. Jiva has the stainless and immutable Chit for his progenitor. Like the wind, which is hueless, catching hues from surrounding objects and making its own hueless progenitor look as if it has hues, Jiva also, though in reality stainless, catches stains from Ignorance and Acts and makes his own progenitor, the stainless and immutable _Chit_, display stains of every kind. This is how the commentator puts the simile, supplying the points that have been omitted in the text.

[^846]: 293:3 These aphorisms are very abstruse. What is meant by saying that the attainment of Brahma does not depend upon Acts is this: Acts are terminable. Their consequences also are terminable. Acts, therefore, can never be the means by which Brahma can be attained, for Brahma is interminable and eternal, not like the felicity of heaven which is changeful. The only means by which Jiva may revert to Brahma is by dispelling Ignorance through Knowledge; or, as the Upanishads declare, one attains to it as one gets one's forgotten necklace of gold, which all the while is on the neck though sought for with assiduity everywhere. K.P. Singha misunderstands it completely. What is meant by the direction about reverencing persons who have attained to Brahma is this: the existence of Brahma and the possibility of Jiva's reverting to that Immutable status are matters that depend upon the conception of such men. Brahma, again, is so difficult to keep, that the great sages never desist for a moment from the culture that is necessary for its retention.

[^847]: 294:1 Intermediate _i.e._, as animals and birds and reptiles and worms, etc.

[^848]: 294:2 _i.e._, if righteous, one attains to happiness; if otherwise, to the reverse.

[^849]: 294:3 Verse 21 and the first line of 22 are grammatically connected.

[^850]: 294:4 _Me_ in the second line is equivalent to _Maya_. _Tatah_ is _tatra yuddhakale_. Hari had come to aid Indra, and hence Vritra had beheld him. He is called Hari because he takes away one's sins. Besides the well-known derivation of the word Narayana, the commentator here offers another, _viz_., the _ayanam_ or _layasthanam_ of _Nara_ or _Jivasangha_.

[^851]: 294:5 _Vaikuntha_ has various etymologies. The commentator inclines to explain it as ‘one who brings together all creatures.’ _Purusha_ is full; as applied to Narayana, it, of course, means one who has no defect but who is the sole representative of fullness. _Sukla_ or _Suddha_ or pure. _Vishnu_ is all-pervading. _Sanatan_ is _kutastha_ or uniform or immutable. _Munjakesa_, is possessed of yellow hair, or hair of the hue of Munja grass. _Harismasru_ is having a tawny beard.

[^852]: 294:6 Penances are meritorious. The very sight of Hari that I obtain was as efficacious as a course of the austerest penances. Of course, in consequence of that and my other penances great have been the rewards that I have enjoyed. It seems, however, that the full measure of rewards has not been reaped; the remnant is to be enjoyed by me now, for I am about to p. 295 ask thee about the fruits of acts. Sacred and highly auspicious is my enquiry. To make it is, in itself, a reward.

[^853]: 295:1 _Vaya_ acts are, of course, sacrifices and other religious acts; by _abhyantara_ acts are meant _santi_, _danti_, _uparati_, _titiksha_, and _samadhi_, _i.e._, the usual course of mental training necessary for Yoga. What the speaker intends to lay down in this verse is that sacrifices are not entirely useless. These may lead to _chitta-suddhi_ or the cleansing of the heart, which, when p. 296 attained, leads to knowledge of Him or the Soul or to Emancipation or Infinity.

[^854]: 296:1 The comparison lies in the fact of the desirability of the two acts. No one likes the stains the body may catch to remain unwashed or unwiped off. Similarly, no one should neglect to wash off the faults that the heart may catch. There is no comparison between the two acts with regard to the degree of effort necessary to accomplish each.

[^855]: 296:2 ‘Efforts born of practice’ refer to both external and internal _Sadhana_.

[^856]: 296:3 _Karmaviseshan_ is explained by the commentator as equivalent to _ragaviraga-hetun_.

[^857]: 296:4 _Sampravartante_ and _tishthanti_ are thus explained by the commentator.

[^858]: 296:5 In the previous verses the speaker describes the training that one should undergo. In this and the following ones, he speaks of the object to be known. _Sreeman_ is explained as _asriyate iti srih_, _i.e._, _upadhih_, _tadvan_. _Hari_ is _Sambharata_. _Narayana_ is _saravasrayah_. _Prabhu_ is _sarvaniyanta_. _Deva_ is _dyotate-iti_ _i.e._, _Chinmatrah_. These etymologies must be grasped for understanding this verse.

[^859]: 296:6 The ‘mutable’ in all creatures is the combination of the five primal essences. The ‘immutable’ in them is Jiva, or Chit as invested with ignorance. The eleven modifications that constitute. His essence are the eleven senses of knowledge and action with the mind. Equipped with these eleven. He drinketh the universe, _i.e._, enjoys it. The rays are these senses themselves. Equipped with the senses. He enjoys the universe with the senses.

[^860]: 297:1 ‘His mind is _in_ the Moon.’ _i.e._, His mind is the Moon. The expression ‘waters in the Ganges,’ implies a distinction that does not exist between container and contained, for ‘Ganges,’ means the water so named.

[^861]: 297:2 The _sandhi_ between _sa_ and _acramanam_ is _arsha_.

[^862]: 297:3 _Dharma_ has various meanings all of which, however, are closely created with one another. As duty, or the assemblage of all acts which we should do, it is both Righteousness and Religion.

[^863]: 297:4 The Sacrificial _grahas_ or _patras_ (vessels) are called after the names of the deities Indra, Vayu, Soma, etc. The sixteen Ritwijes are Brahman, Hotri, Adhyaryu, Udgatri, etc.

[^864]: 297:5 Verse 21 to 23 show the unity of the Divine Being. The variety perceived is only apparent, not real.

[^865]: 297:6 Verse 31 and 32 are not difficult; yet the Burdwan translator makes nonsense of the same.

[^866]: 298:1 This is elaborated in the _Vishnu Purana_, Part I, Sec. V. There are three primary creations, _viz_., _Mahat_, the five primal essences in their subtile forms and the senses. From the Six colours again six other creations have sprung. To the Dark colour is due all immobile creatures; to the Tawny all the intermediate order of creatures (_viz_., the lower animals and birds, etc.); to the Blue are due human beings, to the Red the Prajapatyas; to the Yellow the deities; and to the White are due the Kumara, _i.e._, Sanatkumara and others.

[^867]: 298:2 Emancipation is so difficult.

[^868]: 298:3 The construction of the first line is this: _subham darsanam_ (auspicious scriptures) _gatwa_ (prapya) _Devah yam gatim_ (identical with) _darsanam_ (atmanubhavatmikam) _aha_, _Gati_ is naturally dependent on _Varna_, and _Varna_ upon ‘Time or acts.’

[^869]: 298:4 There are ten senses of knowledge and action. To this must be added Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara and Chitta, which are sometimes called the four _Karanas_. In consequence of these fourteen, fourteen different kinds or merit and demerit may be achieved by Jiva who is their possessor. These fourteen kinds of merit and demerit also, are subdivided into hundreds of thousands each. Jiva, in course of his wanderings through the universe, ascends in the scale of Being, stays in particular rungs, and falls down from them into lower rungs, accordingly, What the speaker wishes to inculcate is that these fourteen should always be towards the attribute of _Sattwa_ or Goodness.

[^870]: 298:5 This life, it should be noted, leadeth to Jiva's transformation as an immobile object. A creature of Dark hue becomes addicted to wicked acts and rots in hell His existence as an immobile object is hell itself.

[^871]: 299:1 _Prajavisargah_ is the period for which one Creation lasts, being equal to what is called a Kalpa.

[^872]: 299:2 The Dark and the Tawny hues of their corresponding states of existence, _viz_., the immobile and the intermediate, are regarded as states of endurance. Hence, when the misery that is their portion has been fully endured, the recollection is suddenly irradiated into the mind, of the righteousness that distinguished Jiva in ages far remote. _Anisa_ is helpless or cheerless.

[^873]: 299:3 _Cha_ at the end of the second line is equivalent to _va_. Unless _cha_ be taken as equivalent to _va_ the verse would yield no meaning. After Tawny comes Blue, _i.e._, after attainment of existence as an Intermediate creature Jiva attains to humanity. This occurs when Sattwa does not predominate. Hence _anyatha_ should be supplied after _upaiti_.

[^874]: 299:4 _Vyatite_ is a finite verb in indicative mood, as pointed out by the commentator. It comes from root _i_ with suffix _vi_. After _sate_ supply _jate sati_. The Burdwan translator takes it as a participial adjective in the locative singular, which is, of course, wrong. The version he gives of this line is most ridiculous, containing as it does a self-contradictory assertion. K. P. Singha gives the right meaning.

[^875]: 299:5 When Jiva becomes a Deva, he has still the ten senses, the five _Pranas_, and the four internal possessions of mind, understanding, Chitta, and Ahankara, amounting in all to nineteen. These nineteen impel him to thousands of acts. Hence, even when transformed into Deva, Jiva is _not_ freed from acts, but is in _niraya_ or hell,—acts being, under all circumstances, equivalent to hell.

[^876]: 300:1 _Vyuha_ implies the varied forms of one and the same thing _Daivani_ in _Sattwa-pradhanani_. The five senses, with the mind, the understanding form a total of seven. The acts achieved through each of these may be subdivided a hundredfold. As these seven possessions adhere to Jiva till he becomes emancipated, he acts through these seven in a variety of ways, Relying, therefore, upon these seven hundred kinds of acts (which are but varied forms of one and the same thing, _viz_., Action), Jiva successively becomes Red and Yellow and White. Arrived at White, he courses through certain highly effulgent regions which are superior to the region of Brahman himself, and which leave behind or beneath them the Eight _Puris_ (by which, perhaps, is meant the _puri_ of Indra, that of Varuna, etc., or, Kasi, Mathura, Maya, etc., or symbolical stages of progress, which are fraught with great felicity). Those highly effulgent and adorable regions are obtainable by Knowledge alone or the fruit of Yoga.

[^877]: 300:2 This is an exceedingly abstruse verse. The Burdwan version, in which unconnected bits of the commentary have been jumbled together, is utter nonsense. K.P. Singha skips over nearly the whole verse. The Eight _puris_ referred to in the previous verse are here stated to be identical with the Sixty well-known incidents of even Sukla or White existence. This tale of Sixty is arrived at in this way: 1st, the state of wakefulness; 2nd, the gross body made up of the five primal essences; 3rd, the five attributes of sound, scent, form, taste, and touch; these come up to seven. Then come the ten senses of action and knowledge; the five breaths; mind, understanding, consciousness, and chitta: these form 19. Then come Avidya, Kama, and Karma. With Soul or the Beholder, the sum comes up to 30. The number becomes doubled when the state of Dream is taken into consideration, for like Wakefulness existing with the 29, Dream also exists with the 29. With those that are effulgent, _i.e._, with Beings that are Sukla or White, these 60 are simply _mano-viruddhani_ or _manomatrani_ eva. Unlike other Beings in lower spheres of existence, they that are effulgent or Sukla do not regard the states of Wakefulness and Dream as different but as the same. Hence, the _para gati_ of such Beings is a state of existence that transcends both Wakefulness and Dream, and transcends Dreamless slumber also (for in Dreamless slumber the 30 exist suspended, to be revived with the return of wakefulness), and is identical with the fourth state called Turiya.

[^878]: 301:1 What the speaker wishes to lay down here is that even he that is _Jivanmukta_ or has achieved his Emancipation though living like other, is incapable of transcending the effects of his past acts. Every kind of existence or life (save that which is identical with Brahma) is _anistha_ or inauspiciousness. That _Yogin_ who is _Jivan-mukta_ but who is not able to cast off the felicities of Yoga-puissance, resides in one and the same body for a full century of Kalpas, in a superior form of life, and after the expiry, of that century of Kalpas, he passes through four other regions named _Mahar_, _Jana_, _Tapas_, and _Satya_. Now, _this_ is the end of such a Yogin, who, of course, belongs to the sixth colour which is White, and who is freed from attachments and who is unsuccessful though successful, _i.e._, who has achieved Yoga-success but who has not still been able to achieve that success which consists in beholding Brahma or _Brahma-sakshatkara_. By _anisah_ in this verse is meant that Yogin who is incapable of casting off the felicities brought about by Yoga-puissance. K.P. Singha gives the substance of the verse not very accurately. The Burdwan translator, in the version he gives, introduces three nominatives in the three sentences into which he splits it, _viz_., Jiva, the Yogin who is unable to cast off the felicities brought about by Yoga-puissance, and the Yogin who has achieved _Brahma-sakshatkara_, without understanding that all three refer to one and the same person.

[^879]: 301:2 _Anisah_ here means one who, after having attained to eminence by Yoga, falls off from Yoga. _Tatra_ means heaven or the superior regions that are his in consequence of Yoga-eminence. For a century of Kalpas such a person has to dwell in heaven, with the unexhausted remnant of his senses, _i.e._, the senses of knowledge with mind and understanding, being always predisposed towards the attribute of _Sattwa_. Upon the expiry of that century of Kalpas, such a person, without ascending, descends to the world of men, but then here eminence of station becomes his.

[^880]: 301:3 _Saptakritwah_ is seven times. _Paraiti_ is ‘courseth through.’ _Lokah_ refers to the seven regions called respectively, _Bhur_, _Bhuvar_, _Sivah_, _Mahar_, _Jana_, _Tapas_, and _Satya_ (or Brahmaloka). What is intended to be said here is this: If the Yogin, having attained to only the first stage of Yoga, dies, he ascends to heaven. Thence failing down on Earth, he becomes an Emperor and thus conquers the Earth or _Bhu_. In this way, as the Yogin gradually ascends in the path of Yoga, he ascends higher and higher. In this verse _Sambarevikshepa_ has been used to signify _Samadhi_ and awakening from _Samadhi_, for in the first the universe is destroyed, and in the second it is re-created. At the end, he reaches the region of _Satya_ or _Brahma_. Thence even he has to return if he has not been able to achieve _Brahma-sakshatkara_.

[^881]: 302:1 The seven that the Yogin desirous of Emancipation casts off are either the seven regions already referred to _viz_., _Bhu_, _Bhuva_, _Swah_, _Maha_, _Jana_, _Tapa_, and _Satya_, or the five senses of knowledge with mind and understanding. _Samharam_ is equivalent to _Samhritya_, having been formed by the suffix _namul_. _Upaplavoni_ are sources of grief or misfortune. The first _Devasya_ refers to Mahadeva. The Saivas call that region Kailasa. The Vaishnavas call it Vaikuntha. The _Hiranya-garbhas_ call it Brahman's or _Brahmaloka_. Sesha is Ananta, a particular form of Narayana. They who call it the region of Nara are, of course, the Sankhyas, for these regard Emancipation as the goal of Jiva or every creature. The _Devasya vishnoh_ (in the third line) is _Dyotamanasya Brahmanah_ _i.e._, _Chinmatrasya_, or of the pure Chit when uninvested with ignorance or Avidya. The Aupanishadas regard it as the region of Para-Brahma. The commentator clearly points out what the seven regions are. K.P. Singha, misunderstanding the verse, mentions only five; the Burdwan translator six.

[^882]: 302:2 This verse is not at all difficult; yet the Burdwan translator makes utter nonsense of it. K.P. Singha gives the substance of the first line, but skips over the second. Without giving a literal version of the first line, I expand it, following the lead of the commentator.

[^883]: 302:3 _Sa_ here indicates the person conversant with Brahma. The construction is _Sa yavat saseshabhuk asti tavat prajah tathaiva te sukle dyvyau cha tadangeshu_ (vartante). _Etat_ in the second line is this _paridrisyamanam viyadadi_. What the speaker wishes to inculcate in this verse is that unto one conversant with Brahma, the whole universe up to complete identity with Brahma is as contiguous as a plum in the palm of the hand. When the Chitta is cleansed by Yoga as practised by _Dhyana_, _Dharana_, and _Samadhis_, then the perceptible universe appears to him as identical with his own senses. The two white sciences referred to are _Paravidya_ and _Aparavidya_, _i.e._, all knowledge including that of Brahma.

[^884]: 303:1 _Suddhena manasa_,—with cleansed mind, _i.e._, with the aid of _Sarvana_ (hearing), _Manana_ (attention), _Dhyana_ (contemplation), and _Abhyasa_ (repeated meditation). Two stages are indicated in this verse. The first is the attention of the _suddham_ and _paramam gatim_ or the stainless and high end. This is equivalent to _Brahma-sakshatkara_. After this comes the second stage, which is the _avayam sthanam_ or the spot which knows no deterioration, _i.e._, Emancipation. This is identical with the attainment of Eternal Brahma which is _dushprapyam_ or difficult of attainment.

[^885]: 303:2 The commentator says that the object of this verse is to inculcate the Impersonality of God. God is at the Root of all things, _i.e._, (as the commentator supposes according to the teaching of the Vedanta philosophy). He exists in His own unmodified nature, even as pure Chit. Both _Vidya_ (Knowledge) and _Avidya_ (Ignorance or illusion) exist in Him. In consequence of the latter he is _Bhagavan_, _i.e._, endued with the six grand attributes of puissance, etc.

[^886]: 303:3 In the form of all things,—causes and effects-which constitute them.

[^887]: 304:1 A _Pyakta-parsant_ is explained by the commentator in this way. Vritra was a firm devotee of Vishnu. He did not, therefore, deserve defeat and fall. How, then, was he vanquished by Indra? _Avyaktam_ is equivalent to _aspashtam_.

[^888]: 304:2 The word used in verse 4 is _vinihatah_ and that in verse 5 is _nirjitah_. There can be no doubt that both imply the same idea.

[^889]: 305:1 _Astha_ is efforts.

[^890]: 305:2 _Rathantara_ is another name for certain _Samans_, which are so called because of men being able to cross the world with their aid as by a car. (_Ratha_ car, and _tri_ to cross).

[^891]: 306:1 ‘Praising thee, for thy victory, etc.,’ _i.e._. the _Rishis_ are uttering hymns of praise for conferring victory on thee.

[^892]: 306:2 _Raudrah_ may mean also ‘appertaining to Rudra, which is another name of Mahadeva.’

[^893]: 306:3 This account of the encounter between Vritra and Indra is substantially different from what occurs in the _Vana Parva_. Then again the part the _Rishis_ are made to take in the slaughter of the _Asura_ is certainly censurable. The great _Rishis_, even for benefiting the three p. 307 worlds, would not certainly injure any creature. In the above account, Vasishtha and Vrihaspati and the others are very much represented as persons who have bet largely on Indra's success. In the account occurring in the _Vana Parva_, Indra is represented as standing in awful dread of Vritra and hurling his thunderbolt without even deliberate aim, and refusing to believe that his foe was dead till assured by all the deities. The present account seems to be a much older than that in the _Vana Parva_.

[^894]: 307:1 _Amanusham_ is literally inhuman. The use of such words are due to temporary forgetfulness in such connections. Like Homer, Vyasa also nods.

[^895]: 307:2 _Vadhya_ is the slaughter in her embodied form.

[^896]: 308:1 _Dwijapravarvadhya_ means the slaughter of a superior person of the regenerate order. Indeed, Vritra was a lineal descendant of the great sage Kasyapa, the common progenitor of the Devas and Asuras. Then, again, Vritra was certainly a very superior person.

[^897]: 308:2 The rules or ordinance referred to it is about the killer of a Brahmana being liable to be overtaken by the sin of Brahmanicide.

[^898]: 310:1 _Anadhrishyam_ is, literally, unvanquishable.

[^899]: 311:1 Uma or Parvati, the daughter of Himavat, the spouse of Siva.

[^900]: 311:2 The self-created Brahman at first created, by flats of his holy will, certain beings who were charged to procreate for filling the universe with living creatures. These are the _Prajapatis_ or lords of all creatures. Amongst them was Daksha. Other accounts represent Daksha as the grandson of Brahman.

[^901]: 312:1 There are three vocatives in this verse, expressive, of course, of great surprise. I omit them in the translation.

[^902]: 313:1 A kind of substance like lac that oozes out of the stones of certain mountains during the hot months. It is also called _Silajit_, is taken internally by many men in the belief that it increases digestion and strength.

[^903]: 313:2 The Indian cuckoo, noted for his clear musical _kuhus_. This is the favourite bird of Indian poets.

[^904]: 315:1 _i.e._, Thou, however, art not so; therefore, it is a matter of surprise that thou shouldst not yet know me. The sense is not at all difficult, but K.P. Singha skips over it.

[^905]: 315:2 Both the vernacular translators have erred in rendering this line. What Mahadeva says to Uma is, how is it that you have thus been stupefied? It is thou that stupefiest others! To see thee stupefied has created surprise in me.

[^906]: 318:1 Mahadeva is called _Virupaksha_ in consequence of his three eyes, the third eye making his features dreadful to behold. He is also called _Tryaksha_ for his possession of three eyes.

[^907]: 319:1 Every worshipper of Mahadeva must fill his mouth with air and then, shutting his lips, strike his cheeks, letting the air gently out at each stroke, and helping it with air from the lungs for keeping the current steady. By doing this a kind of noise is made like _Bom_, _Bom_, _Babam_, _Bom_. Mahadeva is himself fond of this music and is represented as often making ???.

[^908]: 320:1 Vrisha is explained by the commentator as _vrishti-kartri_; _Vrishya_ as _Dharmavriddhikartri_; _Go-vrisha_ as _Nandirupa_; _Katankata_ as _Nityagamanasila_; _Danda_ as _Niyantri_.

[^909]: 320:2 Godhead is frequently likened to _anahatasavda_ or sound not perceptible by the ear, or sound in its nascent state.

[^910]: 320:3 _Huns_ are mystic sounds that stand as emblems for various things. ‘Beyond three _Huns_ means, perhaps, ‘beyond the influence of wrath.’

[^911]: 320:4 In Sacrifice the butter is poured with _mantras_ into the mouth of a selected Brahmana who represents the gods, and into also the sacred fire. What is said here is that the great god is of the form of that Brahmana and of the sacred fire.

[^912]: 321:1 This alludes to the sports of Krishna in the groves of Vrinda with the rustic children who were his companions.

[^913]: 321:2 The sacred stream of the Ganges, issuing out of Vishnu's feet, is held by Brahman in his _Kamandalu_ or jar. Thence it issues out, and coursing through the heavens fall down on the head of Siva, for Siva alone is mighty enough to bear that fall. The matted locks of Siva bear the mark of the fall. This six well-known acts here referred to are _Yajana_, _Yajana_, _Adhyayana_, _Adhyapana_, _Dana_, and _Pratigraha_ (_i.e._, performing sacrifices, assisting at the sacrifices of others, studying, teaching, making gifts, and accepting gifts). The three acts in which Siva is engaged are _Yajana_, _Adhyayana_, and _Dana_ (_i.e._, the first, the third, and the fifth in the above enumeration).

[^914]: 321:3 The commentator explains that by _Sankhya_ the speaker means ‘the propounder of the sceptical philosophy.’ By _Sankhya-mukhya_ which I render, ‘the foremost of Sankhyas’ is meant ‘follower of the theistic philosophy of Patanjala.’ By _Sankhya-yoga_ is meant both _Vedanta_ and _Yoga_.

[^915]: 321:4 ‘That hast a car and that hast no car’ means, as the commentator explains, ‘capable of coursing, without obstruction, through Water, Fire, Wind, and Space.’

[^916]: 321:5 _Isana_ is ‘much desired’ or ‘much coveted by all persons.’

[^917]: 322:1 _i.e._, thou createst and destroyest these repeatedly or settest them in motion.

[^918]: 322:2 These are syllables with all singers of the Samans utter for lengthening short words in order to keep up the metre.

[^919]: 322:3 _i.e._, He who is adored in these hymns is thyself and no other.

[^920]: 323:1 These are the ten colours known to the _Rishis_.

[^921]: 323:2 _Lohitantargata-drishtih_ is explained by the commentator as _Lohita antargata cha drishtirasya_. By ‘red eyes’ is, of course, meant eyes of the colour of the lotus. By ‘eyes turned inwards’ is meant one whose gaze is upon his soul, _i.e._, one who is engaged in _Samadhi_.

[^922]: 323:3 _Chalachalah_ is explained as exceedingly _chalah_ or swift. _Achalah_ is _nasti chalo yasmat_; hence _chaleshu_ (_api_) _achalah_ is swift amongst the swift, or swifter than the swiftest.

[^923]: 324:1 The great god is a fish wandering in the waters, _i.e._, as _Jiva_ wanders in space; he is a fish in the net, _i.e._, as _Jiva_, invested with Darkness or Illusion, is obliged to take birth.

[^924]: 324:2 _Meghakala_ is the time when clouds appear, _i.e._, the time of the universal deluge. _Samvartaka_ and _Valahaka_ are the two clouds that appear on the occasion of the universal destruction.

[^925]: 324:3 _Mili-Mili_ is explained by the commentator differently. According to him, one connected with all things as cause is _Mili_. It is duplicated to show that Siva is always so. I prefer taking the word as meaning ‘cause of causes.’ ‘The bearer of Danda, with, again, a bald head’ is a _Paramahansa_, _i.e._, one who has renounced the world and its ways.

[^926]: 324:4 The four Sacrificial fires are _Treta_, _Avasathya_, _Dakshina_, and _Sahya_.

[^927]: 324:5 _Silpika_ is one who is not well-skilled, or is ill-skilled, in the arts. It implies a common artisan.

[^928]: 324:6 _Dhatri_ is _adikartri_ or Vishnu. _Vidhatri_ is the four-headed. Brahman _Sandhatri_ is he who joins all things into one; the second _Vidhatri_ means the designer of destinies.

[^929]: 325:1 The identity of Maheswara with Narayana or Krishna is here preached. In his incarnation of Krishna, Vishnu sported with the children of the cowherds of Vrinda and sportively lowed as a cow. He also protected the kine of Vrinda from floods, poison, etc. _Govrisheswara_ is Nandi, the attendant of Mahadeva.

[^930]: 325:2 The word _Go_ in _Gomargah_ is used to signify the senses.

[^931]: 325:3 _Durvaranah_ is explained by the commentator as ‘irresistible when coming as Death.’ _Durvishah_ is ‘destroyer of all kinds of poison in thy form of Amrita.’ _Durdharshah_ is incapable of being frightened. _Durvishah_ is incapable of being measured.

[^932]: 325:4 _Vishagnipah_ is drinker of poison and fire. Siva is represented as the acceptor of all things that are rejected by others. In this consists his true divinity, for to the Deity nothing in the universe can be unacceptable or worthy of being cast off. The ashes of the funeral pyre are p. 326 his, the poison produced by the churning of the ocean was his. He saved the universe by swallowing the poison on that occasion.

[^933]: 326:1 _Tushitadyapah_ is the correct reading. Thou protectest him who is the _adya_ of the _tushita_, _i.e._, thou protectest Brahman himself.

[^934]: 326:2 The commentator explains that what is meant by Mahadeva's staying ‘alone’ is that he is the knower, the known, and knowledge. ‘On the other side of the ocean’ means ‘on the other side of desire and attachment, etc.’ ‘Overwhelming many thousands of persons’ means overwhelming all creatures,' _i.e._, transcending them by his energy and knowledge.

[^935]: 326:3 Of course, Yogins are spoken of.

[^936]: 326:4 The eclipses of both the Moon and the Sun are caused, according to the Pauranic mythology, by Rahu devouring the Moon and the Sun at certain well-known intervals. Rahu is an _Asura_ whose head only is still alive. _Vide_ Adi Parva, On Churning of the Ocean.

[^937]: 327:1 _Garbhah_ means embryos or infants in the womb. The deities ere referred to by this word, for they are embryos that have been born in Mahadeva, _Patitah_ has _twattah_ understood after it. _Anu_ means ‘after’ _i.e._, ‘after Brahman's creation.’

[^938]: 327:2 These Beings are Rudras or portions of the great Rudra.

[^939]: 327:3 _Tasmaih paramgatah_,—_param_ is _utkrishtam_ _i.e._, Renunciation and other superior practices. _Tasmai_ is ‘for the sake of That,’ _i.e._, for _Iswarah_.

[^940]: 328:1 Hence in this, the present _Kalpa_ too, I am obliged to do the same, for all Kalpas must be similar in respect of the events that transpire in them.

[^941]: 328:2 _Matri-pakshe_ seems to be a misreading for _bhartripakshe_.

[^942]: 329:1 By gunah which I have rendered ‘virtues,’ is, of course, intended all that constitute the body, including mind and understanding, all, in fact, that become the accompaniments of the Soul.

[^943]: 330:1 _Karma-buddhi_ is to be taken as one. It means the consciousness or apprehension of functions. Each sense or organ instinctively knows what its object is and apprehends that object immediately. This apprehension of its own functions, which every sense possesses, is here designated as _Karma-buddhi_. _Mana-shashththani_ here simply means ‘mind completing the tale of six.’ It has no reference to the five senses having the mind for the sixth, for the senses have already, been named in the previous verses.

[^944]: 330:2 Acts here means the acts of past lives, or the desire dwelling in an incipient form, due to the acts of past lives. The commentator explains that the _cha_ in the second line means the five attributes indicated in the first line.

[^945]: 330:3 The word _Buddhya_ in the first line is taken by the commentator as an instrumental and not as a genitive. Hence he takes it that _Kalpitani_ is understood after it.

[^946]: 330:4 _i.e._, occupies them one after another.

[^947]: 331:1 _Murti_ is a misreading for _apurti_ or discontentedness. The Burdwan translator retains _murti_ in his Bengali version. It is not clear which reading K.P. Singha adopts. The Bengali substitute he gives is _murchccha_ or stupefaction.

[^948]: 331:2 _i.e._, there are no materials of which it is constituted. Hence _Sattwa_ or _Buddhi_ has no _asrayah_ or _upadana_.

[^949]: 332:1 What the speaker inculcates in verses 41 and 42 is this: some are of opinion that with the apparent destruction of the body, the attributes that make up the body do not cease to exist. It is true that they cease to become apprehensible by the senses; but then, though removed from the ken of the senses, their existence may be affirmed by inference. The argument is that, if destroyed, their reappearance would be impossible. The reappearance, however, is certain. (For rebirth is a doctrine that is believed to be a solemn truth requiring no argument to prove it). Hence, the attributes, when apparently destroyed, do continue to exist. They are regarded as then inhering in the _linga_ or subtile body. The counter opinion is that, when destroyed, they are destroyed for ever. The latter opinion is condemned by the speaker.

[^950]: 332:2 In the second line the word is _Gadhamavidwansah_, _i.e._, ‘ignorant of its bottom or depth.’ K.P. Singha gives the meaning correctly, without translating the verse literally, The Burdwan translator makes nonsense of it. Both however, wrongly take _agadha_ as the final word in _yathagadha_, forgetting that _agadham_ is a masculine adjective incapable of qualifying _nadim_ which is feminine. _Ayam_ is Jiva. The last clause is to be taken as _buddhiyogam anuprachyuta ayam tatha_.

[^951]: 332:3 This is not a difficult verse, yet both the vernacular translators have misunderstood it. What is said in the first line is this: _yat vahudosham karoti, yat_ (_cha_) _purakritam, ekatah cha dushyati_. Both the finite verbs have _jnanin_ (the man of knowledge) for their nominative understood. _Dushyati_ means _nasyati_ or destroys. The meaning then is that the man of Knowledge destroys his sinful acts of both this and past lives. The commentator cites the well-known simile of the lotus leaf not being drenched or soaked with water even when dipped in water. Now, this is that unseen fruit of Knowledge. In the second line, the visible fruits are indicated. The man of Knowledge refrains from censuring the wicked acts of others and from perpetrating any wicked act himself. _Yat cha dushyati_ means _yat parakritam_ p. 333 _anishtam dushyati_ or _nindati, yat karoti_ means _yat swayam ragadi-doshat karoti; tadubhayam apriyam_ (_sa_) _na karoti_, the reason being _dwaitadarsana-bhavah_. Such a man truly regards the universe as identifiable with himself.

[^952]: 333:1 _i.e._, in even thy direst distress thou dependest on thyself. To cross the fearful river of life without a raft and with the aid of only one's bare arms implies great self-dependence.

[^953]: 333:2 That which did not exist and will not exist, exists not at the present moment. Everything, therefore, which is of the nature of _asat_ is non-existent. Our sorrows are connected with the _asat_. Knowing this, I have cast off all sorrows.

[^954]: 333:3 I have understood that acts are for sorrow; that the fruits also of acts are for sorrow in spite of the apparent character of some; and that the fruits of acts are varied, sometimes other fruits appearing than those expected. Hence, I do not indulge in sorrow, for I avoid acts and do not grieve for not obtaining the fruits of acts or for the accession of fruits other than those apparently agreeable.

[^955]: 333:4 The sense is that we who avoid acts, are not dead; in fact, we live quite as others do; and those others, how unequally circumstanced! The Burdwan translator makes nonsense of the first line simple though it is.

[^956]: 333:5 Ignorance lies at the root of sorrow. By casting off ignorance, we have avoided sorrow. Hence, neither religion or religious acts such as Sacrifices, etc., can do us any good or harm. As regards happiness and misery again, these two cannot agitate us at all, since we know their value, both being ephemeral in comparison with the period for which we are to exist.

[^957]: 334:1 Hence, no one should indulge in pride, saying, ‘I am happy,’ nor yield to sorrow, saying, ‘I am miserable.’ Both happiness and misery are transitory. The man of wisdom should never suffer himself to be agitated by these transitory states of his mind.

[^958]: 334:2 The first word is read either as _bhavatmakam_ or _bhavatmakam_. The first means _samsararupam_; the second, _drisyatmakam_.

[^959]: 334:3 I am obliged to behold them because I am a living being having a body, but then I behold them as an unconcerned witness.

[^960]: 335:1 The scriptures contain both kinds of instruction. There are declarations that are entirely in favour of Acts or observances. There are again declarations in favour of Knowledge. What the speaker asks is that the Rishi should discourse upon what the speaker should do, _i.e._, whether he should betake himself to the acquisition of Knowledge or to the doing of acts.

[^961]: 335:2 _i.e._, Each Asrama speaks of particular observances and courses of conduct as beneficial. This, therefore, is a source of confusion to men of plain understandings. Is there no distinction then among duties or observances in respect of their beneficial character? This is the question propounded. The commentator thinks by the word _asramas_ is meant the four principal faiths and _not_ the modes of life.

[^962]: 335:3 I retain the word _asrama_ in the English version as it is very doubtful in what sense it has been used in the original. The commentator explains that by four _asramas_ are meant the four principal forms of creed prevalent at one time in India. The first is that there is no p. 336 such thing as virtue or righteousness. This is ascribed to Sakya Simha or Buddha. The second is that righteousness consists in only the worship of trees, etc. The third is that only is righteousness which the Vedas have laid down. The fourth is that transcending righteousness and its reverse there is something for whose attainment one should strive. _Yatha samkalpitah_ is explained by the commentator as _yo yena sreyastena bhavitastasya tadeva sreyah_.

[^963]: 336:1 _Gunoddesam_ is _Gunakirtanam_ or the announcement of merits. What Narada says here is this: the asramas are four. The merits of each have been proclaimed by their respective founders. The principal merit each claims is that it leads to knowledge of Self. Now, the announcement is _nanarupam_; it is also _prithak_; and lastly, it is _viprasthitam_ or contradictory, for, as the commentator points out, that which a particular _asrama_ announces to be righteous is according to another unrighteous. Both the vernacular translators give incorrect versions.

[^964]: 336:2 _Te_ refers to asramas. _Abhipretam_ is _atma-tattwarupam_. _Yanti_ is equivalent to _prapayanti_.

[^965]: 336:3 _Mitranam_ is taken by the commentator to be equivalent to _sarva-bhuta-labhayapadanam_, _i.e._, they who have given the pledge of harmlessness to all creatures. By enemies is meant here the envious and harmful.

[^966]: 336:4 In previous Sections the nature of Truth has been discussed. A formal truth may be as sinful as a lie, and a lie may be as meritorious as a Truth. Hence, the ascertainment of Truth is not easy.

[^967]: 336:5 _Atiyoga_ and _Ayoga_ are well-known words which have no chance of being misunderstood p. 337 in the way in which they have been misunderstood by both the vernacular translators. Indeed. K.P. Singha blunders ridiculously, while the Burdwan translator limits them to only the use of food, supposing the commentator's concrete examples exhaust the meaning.

[^968]: 337:1 _i.e._, where an intermingling takes place of the four orders of men, _viz_., where _Varna-sankara_ occurs.

[^969]: 337:2 Mere companionship with the righteous leads to righteous acts; while that with the sinful leads to acts of sinfulness.

[^970]: 338:1 _Anuvishayam_ is _vishayam anu vartate_, _i.e._, _rasah_ or flavour. An eater of vighasa is a good or pious man. What is said here is that such men eat for only filling their stomachs and not because eating is source of enjoyment or gratification. _Atmavishayan_ is _Buddherviseshatovandhakan_, _i.e._, _rasa-viseshan_.

[^971]: 338:2 _Agamayamanam_ is _Agamam pramanajam jnanam atmana ichcchatam_.

[^972]: 338:3 _Akasasthah_ is _niralamvanah_, _i.e._, men who have no foundations to stand upon. The Bombay text reads _dosham_, the Bengal texts, _doshan_; the sense remains unaltered. The Bombay reading is _atmapujabhikama_, while the Bengal reading is the same word in the plural form. I accept the singular form and take it as qualifying panditah.

[^973]: 338:4 Some of the Bengal texts read _khattam_. The Bombay reading is _khatwam_. The commentator explains that _khatwam samarudhah Tibra duhkha-grastah_. _Anusayi_ means _purvakarmavasanavan_. The sense seems to be this: the desires born of one's past acts, _i.e._, acts of previous lives, adhere to the mind. Nothing can wipe them off, save _Nivritti_ and _Tattwajnanam_ or knowledge of truth. One should, therefore, practise the religion of _Nivritti_ and seek to acquire knowledge of Truth.

[^974]: 338:5 Both the vernacular translators quietly skip over the word _pratyanantarah_.

[^975]: 338:6 _i.e._, where the people are virtuous and given to the performance of their duties.

[^976]: 339:1 _Kamesah_ is possessor of all objects of desire or enjoyment. The sense is this: where the king, casting off desire, wins prosperity for himself; _i.e._, though possessed of wealth, is not attached to wealth. The expression may also mean ‘master of desire,’ _i.e._, where the king casts off desire and masters his desires without allowing the latter to master him.

[^977]: 339:2 _Pratyupasthite_ is _pritipatwena upasthite_, _i.e._, _hiyantanesati_.

[^978]: 339:3 I am not sure that I have understood aright the second line of this verse. It may also mean, ‘No one is able to enumerate all that is beneficial for the Soul in consequence of the wideness of subject.

[^979]: 339:4 _Vrittam_ has _uddisya_ understood after it. The Bombay text reads _pranihitatmanah_; the Bengal reading is _pranihitatmanah_. If the Bengal reading be accepted, it would mean ‘whose soul is fixed or established on _Yoga_.’ _Tapasa_ is explained by the commentator as _swadharmena_, in view of the question of Galava which Narada answers. The sense, however, would remain unaltered if it be taken as standing for Self-control or penances.

[^980]: 340:1 _Sampadam_ is explained by the commentator as _upadesa-yogyata-sriyam_.

[^981]: 340:2 Some texts read _sakyam_; the reading _sakyah_ also occurs. If the former be accepted, it must be taken as referring to _tadawayam_ as the commentator explains. No alteration in sense occurs by adhering to the one reading or the other.

[^982]: 340:3 In the second line some of the Bengal texts read _lobheshu_. The correct reading is _lokeshu_. Both the vernacular translators adhere to the wrong reading.

[^983]: 340:4 _Mokshartha_ is _moksha-prayojanah_.

[^984]: 341:1 The argument contained in these verses is this: as thou dost not know what becomes of thy relatives when they die, thou canst not help them then. It seems plain, therefore, that when thou shalt die thy relatives will not be able to do thee any good. Hence, thou gainest nothing by bestowing thy thoughts on thy relatives, forgetting thy own great concern, _viz_., the acquisition of Emancipation. Similarly, when thy relatives live and suffer irrespective of thy life or death, and thou too must enjoy or endure irrespective of their existence or efforts, it is meant that thou shouldst not be forgetful of thy own highest good by busying thyself with the concerns of thy relatives.

[^985]: 341:2 The sense is that one who takes only a handful of corn for the support of life even when millions upon millions of carts loaded with corn await his acceptance, is certainly to be regarded as freed. Literally rendered, the second line is—‘who beholds a shed of bamboo or reeds in a palace,’ meaning, of course, as put above, ‘one who sees no difference between the two.’

[^986]: 342:1 _Avritti_ is want of the means of sustaining life: thence, scarcity or famine.

[^987]: 342:2 The sense is that as the maintenance of wives and children is painful, one should withdraw from the world and retire into solitude.

[^988]: 342:3 The sense seems to be this: Is it a life of domesticity that thou wouldst lead? There is no harm in thy doing this, provided thou behavest in the way pointed out. Is it Emancipation that thou wouldst pursue (in the usual way), _i.e._, by retiring into solitude and betaking thyself to _Sannyasa_? Thou mayst then behave in the way pointed out, and, indeed, that is the way of Sannyasa which leads to Emancipation.

[^989]: 343:1 The planet Venus is supposed to be the sage _Usanas_ or _Sukra_.

[^990]: 343:2 The commentator explains the allusion by saying that formerly Vishnu, induced by the deities, used his discus for striking off the head of _Usanas'_ mother. Hence the wrath of Usanas against the deities and his desire to succour their foes, the Danavas.

[^991]: 343:3 The construction of this verse is very difficult. The order of the words, is—_Indrotha jagatah prabhuh_. _Dhanada_, etc., _tasya kosasaya prabhavishnuh_.

[^992]: 343:4 Persons crowned with _Yoga_\-success are competent to enter the bodies of others and deprive the latter of the power of will. Indeed, the belief is that the latter then become mere automata incapable of acting in any other way except as directed by the enlivening possessor.

[^993]: 344:1 The etymology of _Pinaka_ is _panina anamayat_. The initial and final letter of _pani_ (_pi_) and the middle letter of _anamayat_ (_na_), with the suffix _ka_ make _Pinaka_.

[^994]: 344:2 The last half of the last line may be taken as applying to Usanas.

[^995]: 344:3 The _vriddhim_ that Mahadeva saw could not be his own, for the greatest cannot be greater. The commentator, therefore, is right in holding that _vriddhim_ refers to the greatness of Usanas within Mahadeva's stomach.

[^996]: 344:4 The _sa_ refers to Usanas and not to Mahadeva, as the commentator rightly points out.

[^997]: 346:1 _i.e._, the religions of all the orders and all the modes of life.

[^998]: 346:2 The scriptural injunctions are that one should sacrifice in honour of the gods, pour libations on the sacred fire, make gifts etc, In these exists Righteousness.

[^999]: 346:3 The grammar of the third line is a little involved. _Tasmin_ refers to _Dharme_. Supply _nisthavantah_ after _tasmin_. The sense, of course, is that believing in the efficacy of righteousness, people of all modes of life accomplish the duties of their respective modes.

[^1000]: 346:4 The sinful become intermediate animals. The virtuous attain to heaven. They that are both virtuous and sinful attain to the status of humanity. They that acquire Knowledge become Emancipated.

[^1001]: 346:5 Destiny here means the result of the acts of past lives.

[^1002]: 346:6 The reading I adopt is _jatikritam karma_ etc. Hence, this Verse also represents the arguments of the sceptic or the _Charvakas_. The four kinds of acts are _Nitya_, _Naimittika_, _Kamya_, and _Nishiddha_. If, however, for ‘_jatikritam karma_, etc.,’ the reading _yantyakritam karma_ be adopted, the meaning would be—‘In one's next life one does not meet with fruits that are not the results of one's acts of past life. This must be so, for the opposite opinion would imply the destruction of acts and their consequences. Then again, such an opinion would conflict with the received opinion of mankind, for men, when they obtain the fruits of any p. 347 act, always recollect the four kinds of acts of a past life for explaining the accession of those fruits.

[^1003]: 347:1 Verses 12 to 14 represent the theory of the sceptic, and I have rendered them as such. Only by reading verse 13 as ‘_yantyakritam karma_, etc.,’ the commentator points out that it may be taken as an observation of _Parasara_ himself. As regards verse 15, it represents the _ipse dixit_ of the speaker. He does not think that the sceptic is at all entitled to a reply. It is scarcely necessary to say that the Burdwan translator makes a thorough mess of these verses. K.P. Singha gives the substance correctly.

[^1004]: 347:2 The commentator shows that this is an answer to the sceptic's averment about Nature being the cause of everything. Fire is hot-by nature, therefore, it does not become hot at one time, cold at another, and _lukewarm_ at another time. One becomes either wholly happy or wholly unhappy or wholly happy and unhappy at the same time. Man's nature should not be such. The difference of state is produced by difference of causes.

[^1005]: 348:1 A Brahmana is precluded from eating many things. Many things again that he is competent to eat on all days of the year. In fact, there are many rules for regulating the fare of a Brahmana. To this day, an orthodox Brahmana abstains from many kinds of food. A Brahmana, therefore, who is unscrupulous in respect of his food, is no Brahmana and deserves to be pitied. Similarly, a man who cooks food for himself is an object of pity. Raw food, such as fruits, etc., one may take without offering a share thereof to guests and others. But cooked food can never be taken without a share thereof being given to others. _Yati cha Brahmachari cha pakvannaswaminavubhau_, hence he that takes cooked food without giving a share to these is said to eat _Brahmaswam_ or that which belongs to a Brahmana.

[^1006]: 348:2 This is a very abstruse verse. The grammatical construction of the first line is _asritena manasa vrittihinasya seva sasyate_. _Asritena_ is _niralamvanena_. By _seva_ is meant homage paid to the Supreme in the form of devotion and concentrated meditation. It implies, of course, a thorough reliance on God. _Vrittihina_ is one who has cast off the means of livelihood, implying one who abstains from worldly objects. In the second line, _dwija_ is a vocative. _Nirvritta_ is _nishpanna_, qualifying _seva_. _Atihastat_ is 'from one who has transcended the use of the hand, _i.e._, the necessity of acts. _Atihastanirvritta_, means ‘obtained-from a competent preceptor.’ In brief, what is stated here is that such _seva_ should be learnt from competent preceptors and not by discussion among persons in the stage of spiritual progress.

[^1007]: 348:3 The object of this verse, the commentator points out, is to show the desirability of practising that _seva_ soon or without loss of time.

[^1008]: 348:4 In the discourse of Sanatkumara to Vritra, these six colours have been mentioned, and the nature of the acts by which one attains to a superior colour or falls down from a superior to an inferior one. _Vide_ Sec. 280, ante.

[^1009]: 349:1 A particular kind of _Chandala_ is called _kusalin_.

[^1010]: 349:2 _Pratyapannasya_ is _viparita-drishteh_. _Natma_ is _dehadih_. _Tatah_ is _papaddhetoh_. _Virochate_, is _viseshena atmatwena rochate_.

[^1011]: 349:3 _Pratyapattih_ is _Vairagyam_ or Renunciation. As regards _Prasthitasya_ it may be taken either as implying one that is dead or one that has betaken himself to Yoga. In the latter case, the verse would mean that that man who betakes himself to Yoga without adopting Renunciation meets with much sorrow.

[^1012]: 349:4 The object of this verse is to show that conscious sin can never be destroyed by expiation. The only means by which sin can be destroyed is by enduring its fruits.

[^1013]: 349:5 The Burdwan translator makes utter nonsense of this verse. _Guna-yuktam_ is explained by the commentator as equivalent to _punyakarma_. _Prakasam_ is equivalent to _budhipurvakam prakasya_ or _jnatwa_. It is formed by the suffix _namul_.

[^1014]: 349:6 _Yathatatham_ is _sthula-sukshma-taratamyena_. The sense is that all acts done knowingly produce fruits according to their nature. If gross, the fruits produced are gross; if subtile, the fruits produced are subtile.

[^1015]: 350:1 The speaker's opinion is that all acts are productive of fruits. If good, the fruits are good. If bad, the fruits are bad. There is this difference, however, between acts done knowingly and those done in ignorance: the former produce commensurate fruits _i.e._, if gross, their fruits are gross; if subtile, the fruits are subtile; but the latter produce fruits that are not so, so that even if heinous, the fruits do not involve a large but only a small measure of misery. There is no other difference between the two kinds of acts.

[^1016]: 350:2 The object of this verse is to show that such acts form the exception and they are kept out of my sight in this discourse on acts. The Rishi Viswamitra caused the death of the hundred sons of Vasishtha, and yet he had not to go to hell for it.

[^1017]: 350:3 The sense seems to be that when even such near relatives are cast off if found to be wanting in affection, the fact cannot be gainsaid that people never do good to others except when they hope to benefit themselves by such acts.

[^1018]: 351:1 What is intended to be said is that the acceptance of a gift from a superior person is equal in point of merit to a gift made by a poor person. A wealthy man, by making a gift, earns greater merit than by accepting a gift.

[^1019]: 351:2 _i.e._, by _Dhyana_ and _Dharana_.

[^1020]: 351:3 This has reference to Usanas' attaining to the status of a planet (Venus) in the firmament.

[^1021]: 352:1 _Nadantah_ is one word. It means _Hinsa-sunyah_. _Danti cchinatti iti danta_. Its reverse is _Nadantah_.

[^1022]: 352:2 _Nirdishta_ refers to _Seva_.

[^1023]: 352:3 _i.e._, they take the hues of the society they keep. Hence, it is very desirable for them to live with the good.

[^1024]: 353:1 This son of Dhatri is the god of the clouds.

[^1025]: 354:1 The Burdwan translator gives a most ridiculous version of the expression _Dhigdandasasanah_. Unable to catch the sense, which however is certainly very plain, he actually interprets the words to mean ‘living under the sway of _king Dhigdanda_.’ K.P. Singha gives the correct meaning.

[^1026]: 354:2 In this verse also, the Burdwan translator takes _Dhigdanda_ as the name of a king. He gives an equally ridiculous version of the second line. _Abhyagachchan_ is explained by the commentator as having _vishayan_ understood after it. The sense is that they began to enjoy all objects of the senses to an excess. Both _Devan_ and _Brahman_ are accusatives governed by _Avamanya_. K.P. Singha translates both the lines correctly.

[^1027]: 355:1 This verse is taken as a metaphorical statement. The three Asuras are, of course, _Kama_, _Krodha_, and _Lobha_. _Gaganagah_ (staying in the firmament) is interpreted as ‘existing in _Maya_’. _Sapurah_ as ‘with their gross, subtile, and potential forms;’ 'felled on the earth is explained as ‘merged into the pure chit.’ The whole is taken to imply a spiritual destruction of all the evil passions and a restoration of man to his original state of purity.

[^1028]: 355:2 This chief of the Asura passions was _Mahamoha_ or great Heedlessness. The word _Devas_ here is taken to mean the senses. Of course, if verse 16 be not taken metaphorically, then may _Devas_ be taken in its ordinary sense of the deities.

[^1029]: 355:3 The genius of the two languages being different, it is very difficult to render the phraseology of the first line. Literally rendered, the line would read ‘they remain or stay on those acts, and establish them.’ Besides being unidiomatic, the sentence would be unmeaning. ‘To stay or remain on any act’ is to adhere to it. ‘To establish it’ is to regard it as a precedent and cause it to be regarded by others as a precedent.

[^1030]: 355:4 _Samsiddhadhigamam_ is explained by the commentator thus: _Samsiddhah_ is _nityasiddah_, _i.e._, _atman_; _tadadhigamam_ is _atmajnanam_.

[^1031]: 356:1 The very gods are subject to prosperity and adversity, and their effects of loves and hates. There is no mode of life in which these may not be found.

[^1032]: 357:1 After _sukham_ supply _bhavati_ or some such verb. _Tyajatam_ stands by itself and refers to _kamya karma_, meaning they that abstain from such acts as are not _nitya_ but as are only _kamya_ or optional.

[^1033]: 357:2 The sense is that those who betake themselves to penances as the consequence of despair, are many. Those men, however, are very rare who adopt penances, being at once impressed that the happiness of domesticity is unreal and ends in misery.

[^1034]: 357:3 _i.e._, their penances of past lives.

[^1035]: 357:4 I am not sure that I have correctly understood the second line of this verse. _Akrita-karmanam_ is explained by the commentator as _anut-pannatattwajnanam_ and _upabhogavarityagah_ is Renunciation or _Vairagyam phalani_ has _tapasah_ understood before it. But why _phalani_ instead of _phalam_?

[^1036]: 358:1 The second line of this verse concludes the argument. The _tasmat_ has reference to all the statements before, and _not_ to only the first line of 26. The statement in the second line is the same as the second line of verse 13 above.

[^1037]: 358:2 I expand the second line a little for making it intelligible.

[^1038]: 358:3 By ‘stainless penances’ is meant _nishkamam tapah_ or penances undertaken without desire of fruit.

[^1039]: 358:4 _Tyaktwa_ has _nishkalmasham tapah_ understood after it. The order of the words is _Phalarthi apriyani_ etc., _vishyatmakam tat phalam prapnoti_. The distinction between _nishkamam_ and _sakamam tapah_ is this; through the former one attains to happiness. Even the earthly wealth he earns becomes fraught with happiness; through the latter, however, one meets with diverse kinds of sorrow resulting from the earthly possessions he succeeds in obtaining.

[^1040]: 358:5 The grammar of the first line is this: _Dharme tapasi dane cha_ (_sati avihitakarme_) _vidhitsa_, etc. If _vidhitsa_ be taken with ‘_dharma_, etc.,’ the verse would be unmeaning.

[^1041]: 358:6 The first line is difficult to construe. _Tatah_ means ‘inconsequence of the pain that attends the gratification of the senses.’ _Sarvasya_ refers to _vivekinah_; _jyayase phalartham_ is ‘for the sake of the highest fruit,’ which, of course, is Emancipation. _Gunah_ is ‘same’, ‘dama, etc.’

[^1042]: 359:1 The commentator points out that the object of this verse is to show that everything one owns or does is not the result of the past acts. Spouses, food, drink, etc., one obtains as the result of past acts or _praravdha karma_. In respect of these, _purushakara_ or Exertion is weak. Hence, to put forth Exertion for their acquisition would not be wise. As regards the acquisition of righteousness, however, there Exertion is efficacious. Hence, one should, with Exertion, seek to conform to one's own duties as laid down in the scriptures. Without such a distinction between destiny (praravdha) and Exertion (purushakara), the injunctions and interdictions of the Scriptures would be unmeaning. The Burdwan translator, citing portions of the commentary without at all understanding them, makes utter nonsense of the verse. K.P. Singha gives the meaning correctly.

[^1043]: 359:2 Sacrifices and all other acts undertaken from a sense of vanity, are destructible as regards their consequences, for heaven is terminable. Penances, however, that are undertaken without desire of fruit are not so, for these lead to Emancipation. _Tesham_ refers to those mentioned in the first line of verse 37. It should not be taken to mean men in general, as the Burdwan translator wrongly does.

[^1044]: 361:1 _Kam_ is _Brahmanam_. The commentator explains that Brahmana (the Creator) is equivalent to Brahmana; and that Vishnu is equivalent to Kshatriya. What is said, therefore, in this verse (according to him) is that a Sudra, by practising the common duties of all the four orders, succeeds in his next life in becoming a Brahmana. Thus say Brahmanas learned in the scriptures; but the opinion of Parasara is that such a Sudra, in his next life, takes birth as a Kshatriya.

[^1045]: 361:2 I am not sure that I have understood these two verses correctly. Verse 33 is evidently a cruce.

[^1046]: 362:1 _Yathakarman_ means ‘from one stage to another.’ _Karmapatham_ is _yogam_. The stages here referred to are _vichara_, _vitarka_, _Ananda_, and _Asmita_. What is stated in this verse is that one ho casts off all attachments, and who devotes himself to Yoga, succeeds in attaining to the felicity of Emancipation.

[^1047]: 363:1 The Burdwan translator wrongly renders the second line of this verse. All the texts read this line in the same way.

[^1048]: 363:2 _Snigdhais_ implies affectionate seniors such as mothers, etc.; _karmani_ is explained by the Commentator as _abhyanga-karmani_, _i.e._, the rubbing of oil, etc., Such acts, when children are ill, are often done unto them by mothers. This is forbidden, for they are menial offices which seniors should never be permitted to perform.

[^1049]: 363:3 _Vinasamabhikankhatam_ is explained in the alternative by the commentator in a very fanciful way. _Kriyavatam_ is explained as ‘observant of the duties of Tirthavasins.’

[^1050]: 363:4 The commentator is for explaining the second line exoterically.

[^1051]: 363:5 _Dehat_ is _Deham prapya_. _Yena_ is _yena pumsa_. _Upapaditam_ has reference to _panchatwam_ in the previous verse. The sense of the verse is this: he who meets with a sudden death in a _tirtha_ or sacred place, does not become emancipated but obtains another body in his next life similar to the one he loses. _Adhyanam gatakah_ is that though set or placed on the path of Emancipation, yet he becomes a traveller: his state is due to the inglorious manner of his dissolution.

[^1052]: 363:6 The object of this verse is to show that the man dying in a sacred place becomes reborn as a Rudra or a Pisacha and quickly attains to Emancipation in consequence of his contiguity to Siva. _Mokshabhuteshu_ is _Moksha-yogyeshu_. The neuter form of _taddeham_ is _arsha_.

[^1053]: 363:7 _Gunanancha_ in the second line of verse 14 refers to the objects of the senses, which, as explained in previous Sections, have no independent existence, for they exist only as they exist in desire. The compound of the primal essences and the other things mentioned assumes different shapes through the force of the desires of previous lives.

[^1054]: 364:1 Acts are all perishable in respect of their consequences.

[^1055]: 364:2 It is difficult to give foreigners an idea of what is called _Apamrityu_. All deaths that are caused by such accidents as involve ignominy are called _Apamrityu_. Death from snake-bite, from a fall, by drowning, at the horns of an animal, etc., are instances of _Apamrityu_.

[^1056]: 364:3 Both _yasya_ and _sa_ refer to the foe called Ignorance.’ _Rajaputra_ is a vocative. _Paraiti_ is _nasyati_.

[^1057]: 365:1 _Vanchate_ is preceded by _kamena_ understood.

[^1058]: 366:1 It has been explained in previous sections that _sreyas_ or _nisreyas_ means good or excellent as applied to moral merit.

[^1059]: 366:2 By _buddhiman_ is meant the man who is freed from attachment. Similarly, by _durbuddhih_ is meant the man who is the slave of attachments.

[^1060]: 366:3 _Karanapekshi_ is thus explained by the commentator: _karanaphaladanatmika kriya tannirvittyapekshi_. The sense is that sin can never be destroyed except by endurance of its fruits.

[^1061]: 366:4 The sense is that after the manner of the fabulous gem, _Jiva_ attracts to itself, through Yoga, the status of Brahma.

[^1062]: 366:5 The Burdwan translator, without understanding the commentary, makes utter nonsense of this verse. K.P. Singha is not far wrong, but he does not bring out the principal point which is sought to be inculcated here. Sesame seeds are repeatedly mixed with fragrant The more they are so mixed the more fragrant do they become. After the same p. 367 manner, men acquire the quality of _Sattwa_ by associating with persons of cleansed souls. The measure of _Sattwa_ is dependent on the measure of the association.

[^1063]: 367:1 The track is that of Knowledge. Vide verse 3 above.

[^1064]: 367:2 Having used the words _vistaran_ (Diverse) and _samkshepah_ (Few), in the second line of this triplet, the speaker explains their meaning in the third. By ‘Diverse’ is meant all those fruits that consist of unstable enjoyments; hence, the diverse acts laid down in the Vedas and other scriptures. By ‘Few’ is meant Renunciation, or abstention from acts. What is said, therefore, in this verse is this: they that betake themselves to acts, which for their fruits all sorts of enjoyment, meet with misery; while they that abstain from acts or practise Renunciation meet with happiness. Both the vernacular versions are incorrect.

[^1065]: 367:3 It is difficult to understand what is meant by this verse. By progress in Yoga, the Soul can certainly cast off the mind and other attributes by which it is invested. The simile is unintelligible. The stalk of the lotus has its roots in mire. Does the first line mean, therefore, that the stalk speedily springs upwards and leaves the mire at its roots?

[^1066]: 367:4 The commentator explains that the intention of this verse is to explain that the universe which is created by the mind is destroyed afterwards by the mind itself.

[^1067]: 368:1 The sense is that one who has cast off objects of enjoyment and become emancipated, does not obtain rebirth.

[^1068]: 368:2 I follow the commentator in his exposition of this verse. The practice of fishermen (in India) is to sink their boats when they leave them for their homes, and to raise them again when they require them the next day. They do not leave their boats afloat for fear of the injury the waves may do to them by tossing them too much.

[^1069]: 368:3 By Prakriti here is meant the harmony of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. As long as these three qualities are in harmony with one another, _i.e._, as long as there is no preponderance in any of them over the other two, so long there cannot be creation or the operations of the buddhi or understanding.

[^1070]: 368:4 In this verse the word Prakriti is used in an entirely different sense. It means here Ignorance.

[^1071]: 369:1 _Sariragriha-sanjnasya_ is ‘of one who regards his body to be an accompaniment of the Soul instead of regarding it to be the Soul.’ ‘Who regards purity as its sacred water’, _i.e._, who, without resorting to the sacred waters whither others go for cleansing themselves, thinks that purity, both internal and external, is capable of cleansing him.

[^1072]: 369:2 Vide note to verse 21 above.

[^1073]: 369:3 The object of the verse is to show that one should not, for the sake of friends and kinsmen and spouses and children, abstain from pursuing one's true end. The practice of charity again is the true diet which supports a man.

[^1074]: 369:4 _Astapadapada_ is a weight of gold. The word, as used in this verse, means a quantity of gold. Whether the reading be _mudreva_ or _sutrena_, the sense remains unchanged. What is said here is that the mother, etc., are like lines traced with gold by the side of real gold; _i.e._, the mother, etc., are of no value or use in the acquisition of prosperity. K.P. Singha misses the meaning. The Burdwan translator, however, makes a most ridiculous exhibition of himself. Without understanding the commentary at all, in fact, not having been able to read the words of the commentary aright, he has produced a ridiculous jargon that is utterly unintelligible. Daksha is a vocative, meaning ‘possessed of cleverness.’ The words _he daksha yatha_, etc., of the commentator are read by the Burdwan Pundit as: _deha-kshaya_, etc.’

[^1075]: 369:5 _Apariharavan_ is incapable of being resisted. _Samagatih_ as wind. _Asmasara-vihitam_ is ‘made by means of iron or the saw.’ _Asmasara_ stands here for _krakacha_ or _karapatra_.

[^1076]: 370:1 The commentator explains that by tapah is meant the practice or observance of one's own duties. _Damah_ is restraining the senses. _Satyam_ is truthfulness of speech, and _atmaguptih_ is subjugation of the mind. The knots are attachments and desires, etc.

[^1077]: 371:1 _i.e._, the assailant, finding his victim forgiving, himself burns with repentance.

[^1078]: 371:2 _Vishayena yami_ is the correct reading; _i.e._, then here is palatal, and _vishayena_ is in the instrumental case. The Bengal reading is vicious, for it reads _Vishaye nayami_.

[^1079]: 372:1 The Moon is endued with nectar, and, therefore, might have been such a man's equal; but the Moon waxes and wanes; therefore, the Moon cannot approach to an equality with such a man who is the same under all changes. Similarly, the wind, though unstained by the dust it bears is not the equal of such a man; for the wind is changeful, having slow, middling and quick motion. The Burdwan translator makes utter nonsense of the reference to the Moon and the wind. K.P. Singha gives the sense correctly.

[^1080]: 373:1 The commentator explains that the object of this verse is to show the merits of that man whose ignorance has disappeared.

[^1081]: 373:2 _i.e._, when Brahmanas incur obloquy they are said to become impure; they are again regarded as possessing the status of humanity only because they die.

[^1082]: 375:1 The examples of. Viswamitra and others may be cited in this instance.

[^1083]: 375:2 _Dharana_ is holding the soul in self-reflection, preventing it the while from wandering. _Samadhi_ is complete abstraction.

[^1084]: 376:1 _Akhandam_ is _Sarvakalam_; _uposhya_ is _tyaktwa_. K.P. Singha wrongly translates this verse. He takes _mansam_ for _masam_; but no difference of reading occurs between the Bengal and Bombay texts.
