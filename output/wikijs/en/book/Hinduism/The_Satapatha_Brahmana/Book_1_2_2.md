## SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### THE OBLATIONS.

<span id="v2_2_1_11"><sup><small>2:2:1:11.</small></sup></span>  When he has taken out the Âhavanîya fire [^690], he performs the Full-offering [^691]. The reason why <span id="p303"><sup><small>[ p. 303 ]</small></sup></span> he performs the full-offering is that he thereby causes that Agni to become an eater of food for his own self; that he thereby offers food to him. Even as (a mother or cow) would offer the breast to a new-born child or calf, so does he thereby offer food to him.

<span id="v2_2_1_22"><sup><small>2:2:1:22.</small></sup></span>  And having been appeased by that food, he (Agni) waits patiently for the other oblations to be cooked. If, on the other hand, that oblation were not to be offered up in him, he would ere long burn either the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer, for these two pass nearest by him. This is the reason why he makes this offering.

<span id="v2_2_1_33"><sup><small>2:2:1:33.</small></sup></span>  He offers it (with a) full (spoon); for the full doubtless means the All (universe), so that he thereby appeases him with the All. He offers it with ‘Svâhâ!’ for the Svâhâ is undefined, and undefined also is the All, so that he thereby appeases him by means of the All.

<span id="v2_2_1_44"><sup><small>2:2:1:44.</small></sup></span>  The first offering which Pra<i>g</i>âpati made, he made with ‘Svâhâ!’ Now that (offering) indeed is virtually the same as this one; and hence he (the sacrificer) also makes it with ‘Svâhâ!’ At this (offering) he grants a boon (to the priests) [^692]; but <span id="p304"><sup><small>[ p. 304 ]</small></sup></span> a boon (may mean) everything, so that he thereby appeases him (Agni) with everything.

<span id="v2_2_1_55"><sup><small>2:2:1:55.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say, ‘When he has made this offering, he need not attend to the subsequent oblations; for by this offering he obtains that wish for which he takes out the subsequent oblations.’

<span id="v2_2_1_66"><sup><small>2:2:1:66.</small></sup></span>  He takes out (material for an oblation) [^693] to Agni Pavamâna (the Blowing) [^694]. Now the blowing one is the breath, so that he thereby puts breath into him (the sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering); for breath means food, and this offering also is food. <span id="p305"><sup><small>[ p. 305 ]</small></sup></span> 2:2:1:77\. He then makes offering to Agni Pâvaka (the Purifying). Now the purifying one means food, so that he thereby puts food into him (Agni, or the sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering), for this offering is indeed food.

<span id="v2_2_1_88"><sup><small>2:2:1:88.</small></sup></span>  He then makes offering to Agni <i>S</i>u<i>k</i>i (the Bright). Now brightness means vigour, so that he thereby puts vigour into him. And this he puts into him by means of this (offering); for when he offers up that oblation in him (Agni), then that vigour, that brightness of his blazes up.

<span id="v2_2_1_99"><sup><small>2:2:1:99.</small></sup></span>  For this reason they say, ‘When he has made that (full) offering, he need not attend to any further oblations; for by this offering he obtains that wish for which he takes out the subsequent oblations.’ But let him nevertheless take out the subsequent oblations; for what invisible (blessing, or meaning) there was in that (full-offering) that now becomes thus (visible).

<span id="v2_2_1_1010"><sup><small>2:2:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  Now the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pavamâna, is that the blowing one is the breath. When (the child) is born, then there is breath. And as long as it is not born, it breathes in accord with the mother's breath; but when it is born, then he thereby puts breath into it.

<span id="v2_2_1_1111"><sup><small>2:2:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  And the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pâvaka, is that the purifying one means food: hence he thereby puts food into (the child) when it is born.

<span id="v2_2_1_1212"><sup><small>2:2:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  And the reason why he makes offering to Agni <i>S</i>u<i>k</i>i, is that brightness means vigour. Now when it (the child) grows by means of food, then there is vigour; and hence, when he has made it grow by means of food, he thereby puts into it that vigour, that brightness. This is why (he offers) to Agni <i>S</i>u<i>k</i>i. <span id="p306"><sup><small>[ p. 306 ]</small></sup></span> 2:2:1:1313\. That other (practice) then is altogether erroneous [^695]. For when Agni passed over from the gods to men, he bethought him, ‘I must not pass over to men with my whole body!’

<span id="v2_2_1_1414"><sup><small>2:2:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then laid down in these (three) worlds those three bodies of his. That ‘blowing (pavamâna)’ form of his he laid down on this earth, that ‘purifying (pâvaka)’ one in the ether, and that ‘bright (<i>s</i>u<i>k</i>i)’ one in the sky. Now the <i>Ri</i>shis then existing became aware of this: ‘Agni has not come to us with his whole body,’ they said. They then prepared those oblations for him.

<span id="v2_2_1_1515"><sup><small>2:2:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  Now when he makes offering to Agni Pavamâna, he thereby obtains that form of his (Agni's) which he laid down on this earth; and when he makes offering to Agni Pâvaka, he thereby obtains that form of his which he laid down in the ether; and when he makes offering to Agni <i>S</i>u<i>k</i>i, he thereby obtains that form of his which he laid down in the sky: and thus he lays down the entire Agni unmutilated. For this reason also he should take out the oblations subsequent (to the full-offering).

<span id="v2_2_1_1616"><sup><small>2:2:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  The first oblation has a barhis (altar-covering of sacrificial grass) to itself; the two following ones have one barhis in common. Now the first oblation represents this world, the second one that ether, and the third one the sky. But this earth is compact; and the ether and yonder sky are, as it were, trembling: and in order that these two may counterbalance that (earth), the (last) two (oblations) have one barhis in common. <span id="p307"><sup><small>[ p. 307 ]</small></sup></span> 2:2:1:1717\. All these sacrificial cakes (for Agni) are on eight potsherds; for of eight syllables consists the (pâda of the) gâyatrî, and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre [^696]: with its own metre he accordingly establishes that fire. In all, these potsherds amount to twenty-four; for of twenty-four syllables consists the gâyatrî (stanza), and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: with its own metre he accordingly establishes that fire.

<span id="v2_2_1_1818"><sup><small>2:2:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  He then offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi. For he who performs those (preceding) oblations moves away, as it were, from this world, since he moves in the ascent of these worlds [^697].

<span id="v2_2_1_1919"><sup><small>2:2:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  Now when he offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi,—Aditi being this earth, and this earth being a firm resting-place,—he thereby again takes his stand on this firm resting-place. This is why he offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi.

<span id="v2_2_1_2020"><sup><small>2:2:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  For her, they say, the two sa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>yâs [^698] should be virâ<i>g</i> verses; for the virâ<i>g</i> is this (earth); or <span id="p308"><sup><small>[ p. 308 ]</small></sup></span> trish<i>t</i>ubh verses, for the trish<i>t</i>ubh is this (earth); or <i>g</i>agatî verses, for the <i>g</i>agatî is this (earth). Still, however, they should be virâ<i>g</i> verses.

<span id="v2_2_1_2121"><sup><small>2:2:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  The priests' fee for (offering to) her consists of a cow; for this (earth) is, as it were, a cow: she milks out for men all their desires. The cow is a mother, and this (earth) also is a mother, for she bears the men: for this reason the priests' fee is a cow. This is one mode (of performing those offerings).

<span id="v2_2_1_2222"><sup><small>2:2:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  Then there is this other. He simply offers a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, and thereby, implicitly, to Agni Pavamâna, Agni Pâvaka, and Agni <i>S</i>u<i>k</i>i; and immediately after he visibly sets him up (as Agni). For this reason he offers (a cake) to Agni [^699], and then a potful of boiled rice to Aditi. The treatment of the potful of rice (in that case) is the same (as before).


<span id="v2_2_2"><sup><small>2:2:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v2_2_2_11"><sup><small>2:2:2:11.</small></sup></span>  Now, in performing that sacrifice, they slay it; and in pressing out the king (Soma), they slay him; and in quieting and immolating the victim, they slay it. The havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a they slay with the mortar and pestle, and with the two mill-stones.

<span id="v2_2_2_22"><sup><small>2:2:2:22.</small></sup></span>  When slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous. By means of dakshi<i>n</i>âs (gifts to the priests) the gods again invigorated it: hence the name dakshi<i>n</i>â, because thereby they invigorated (dakshay) that <span id="p309"><sup><small>[ p. 309 ]</small></sup></span> (sacrifice). Whatever, therefore, fails in this sacrifice when slain, that he now again invigorates by means of gifts to the priests; whereupon the sacrifice becomes successful: for this reason he makes gifts to the priests.

<span id="v2_2_2_33"><sup><small>2:2:2:33.</small></sup></span>  He may give six (cows) [^700]; for six seasons, indeed, there are in the year, and the sacrifice, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, is the year: thus as great as the sacrifice is, as large as its extent is, by so many (gifts, dakshi<i>n</i>âs) does he thereby invigorate it.

<span id="v2_2_2_44"><sup><small>2:2:2:44.</small></sup></span>  He may give twelve; for twelve months there are in the year, and the sacrifice, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, is the year: thus as great as the sacrifice is, as large as its extent is, by so many (gifts) does he thereby invigorate it.

<span id="v2_2_2_55"><sup><small>2:2:2:55.</small></sup></span>  He may give twenty-four; for twenty-four half-moons there are in the year, and the sacrifice, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, is the year: thus as great as the sacrifice is, as large as its extent is, by so many (gifts) does he thereby invigorate it. Such is the measure of the priests' fees; but he may give more, according to (the depth of) his faith. The reason why he gives fees to the priests is this.

<span id="v2_2_2_66"><sup><small>2:2:2:66.</small></sup></span>  Verily, there are two kinds of gods; for, indeed, the gods are the gods; and the Brâhmans who have studied and teach sacred lore are the human gods. The sacrifice of these is divided into two kinds: oblations constitute the sacrifice to the gods; and gifts to the priests that to the human gods, <span id="p310"><sup><small>[ p. 310 ]</small></sup></span> the Brâhmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. With oblations one gratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the Brâhmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. Both these kinds of gods, when gratified, place him in a state of bliss (sudhâ) [^701].

<span id="v2_2_2_77"><sup><small>2:2:2:77.</small></sup></span>  Even as seed is poured into the womb, so the officiating priests place the sacrificer in the (heavenly) world [^702], when he now makes gifts to those who, he hopes, will make him go thither. Such, then, (is the manner) of gifts to priests.

<span id="v2_2_2_88"><sup><small>2:2:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, were contending with each other. They were both soulless, for they were mortal, and he who is mortal is soulless. Among these two (classes of beings) who were mortal, Agni alone was immortal; and it was through him, the immortal, that they both lived. Now whichsoever (of the gods) they (the Asuras) slew, he, indeed, was so (slain).

<span id="v2_2_2_99"><sup><small>2:2:2:99.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the gods were left inferior. They went on praising and practising austerities, hoping that they might be able to overcome their enemies, the mortal Asuras. They beheld this immortal Agnyâdheya (consecrated fire).

<span id="v2_2_2_1010"><sup><small>2:2:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Come, let us place that immortal element in our innermost soul! When we have placed that immortal element in our innermost soul, and become immortal and unconquerable, we shall overcome our conquerable, mortal enemies.’ <span id="p311"><sup><small>[ p. 311 ]</small></sup></span> 2:2:2:1111\. They said, ‘With both of us is this fire (Agni): let us then treat openly with the Asuras [^703].’

<span id="v2_2_2_1212"><sup><small>2:2:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘We shall set up (or, establish within ourselves, â-dhâ) the two fires,—what will ye do then?’

<span id="v2_2_2_1313"><sup><small>2:2:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  They replied, ‘Then we shall lay it down (ni-dhâ), saying, Eat grass here! eat wood here! cook pap here! cook meat here!’ Now that fire, which the Asuras thus laid down, is this same (fire) wherewith men prepare their food.

<span id="v2_2_2_1414"><sup><small>2:2:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  The gods then established that (fire) in their innermost soul; and having established that immortal element in their innermost soul, and become immortal and unconquerable, they overcame their mortal, conquerable enemies. And so this one now establishes that immortal element in his innermost soul; and—though there is for him no hope of immortality—he obtains the full measure of life; for, indeed, he becomes unconquerable, and his enemy, though striving to conquer, conquers him not. And, accordingly, when one who has established his fires and one who has not established his fires, vie with each other, he who has established his fires overcomes the other, for, verily, he thereby becomes unconquerable, he thereby becomes immortal.

<span id="v2_2_2_1515"><sup><small>2:2:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  Now, when, on that occasion, they produce that (fire) by churning, then he (the sacrificer) breathes (blows) upon it, when produced; for fire indeed is breath: he thereby produces the one thus produced. He again draws in his breath: thereby he establishes that (fire) in his innermost soul; and that fire thus becomes established in his innermost soul [^704]. <span id="p312"><sup><small>[ p. 312 ]</small></sup></span> 2:2:2:1616\. Having kindled it, he makes it blaze, thinking, ‘Herein I will worship, herein I will perform the sacred work!’ Thereby he makes blaze that fire which has been established in his innermost soul.

<span id="v2_2_2_1717"><sup><small>2:2:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  ‘It (or some one) might come between,—it might go away!’ so (fear some) [^705]; but, surely, as long as he lives no one comes between him and that fire which has been established in his innermost soul: let him, therefore, not heed this. And as to its becoming extinguished:—surely, as long as he lives, that fire which has been established in his innermost soul, does not become extinct in him.

<span id="v2_2_2_1818"><sup><small>2:2:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  The (sacrificial) fires, assuredly, are those breaths: the Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya are the out-breathing and the in-breathing; and the Anvâhârya-pa<i>k</i>ana is the through-breathing.

<span id="v2_2_2_1919"><sup><small>2:2:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  Now, attendance on (or, the worship of) that consecrated fire (agnyâdheya) means (speaking) the truth. Whosoever speaks the truth, acts as if he sprinkled that lighted fire with ghee; for even so does he enkindle it: and ever the more increases his own vital energy, and day by day does he become better. And whosoever speaks the untruth, acts as <span id="p313"><sup><small>[ p. 313 ]</small></sup></span> if he sprinkled that lighted fire with water; for even so does he enfeeble it: and ever the less becomes his own vital energy, and day by day does he become more wicked. Let him, therefore, speak nothing but the truth.

<span id="v2_2_2_2020"><sup><small>2:2:2:2020.</small></sup></span>  Now the kinsmen spake unto Aru<i>n</i>a Aupave<i>s</i>i, ‘Thou art advanced in years: establish thou the two fires!’ He replied, ‘Speak ye not thus! be thou a restrainer of speech [1](../Book_1_2_2#fn706); for he who has established the fires must not speak an untruth: let him rather not speak at all, but let him not speak an untruth. Worship, above all, is truthfulness.’


<span id="v2_2_3"><sup><small>2:2:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### THE PUNARÂDHEYA OR RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SACRED FIRES [^707].

<span id="v2_2_3_11"><sup><small>2:2:3:11.</small></sup></span>  Now Varu<i>n</i>a established this (fire), being desirous of sovereignty. He obtained sovereignty; and, accordingly, whether one (who has established the fires) knows (this) or not, they call him ‘king Varu<i>n</i>a.’ Soma (established the fire), being desirous of glory. He became glorious, and, accordingly, whether one obtains a hold on Soma, or whether <span id="p314"><sup><small>[ p. 314 ]</small></sup></span> one does not, they both obtain (glory),—for it is glory that people thereby get to see. Glorious therefore he becomes, and sovereignty he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, establishes a sacrificial fire of his own.

<span id="v2_2_3_22"><sup><small>2:2:3:22.</small></sup></span>  Now once upon a time the gods deposited with Agni all forms (rûpa) [^708], both domestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle, or from a desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would protect them as the best protector.

<span id="v2_2_3_33"><sup><small>2:2:3:33.</small></sup></span>  But Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the seasons with them. ‘Let us go back thither,’ said the gods, and betook themselves to the place where) Agni (was) concealed. They were disheartened and said, ‘What is here to be done? what counsel is there?’

<span id="v2_2_3_44"><sup><small>2:2:3:44.</small></sup></span>  Then Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> beheld that re-consecrated fire (Punar-âdheya). He established it and thereby gained an entrance to Agni's beloved abode. He (Agni) gave up to him both kinds of forms, domestic and wild: hence they call them Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>'s forms; since it is from Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> that all form proceeds [^709]; but all other creatures of whatever kind undergo it.

<span id="v2_2_3_55"><sup><small>2:2:3:55.</small></sup></span>  It is for him (Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>), then, that one must re-establish the fire: for thus he enters Agni's <span id="p315"><sup><small>[ p. 315 ]</small></sup></span> beloved abode, and the latter gives up to him both kinds of forms, domestic and wild. In that (fire) those two kinds of forms are seen: such is the ascendancy (which one obtains by the punarâdhyeya),—people, indeed, envy him; thus he thrives, and a conspicuous position (is obtained by him).

<span id="v2_2_3_66"><sup><small>2:2:3:66.</small></sup></span>  To Agni belongs this sacrifice. Agni is the light, the burner of evil: he burns away the evil of this (sacrificer): and the latter becomes a light of prosperity and glory in this, and a light of bliss [^710] in yonder, world. This, then, is the reason why he should establish the fires (a second time).

<span id="v2_2_3_77"><sup><small>2:2:3:77.</small></sup></span>  Let him establish the fires (the second time) in the rainy season. The rains are all the seasons, for the rains are indeed all the seasons: hence, in counting over years, people say, ‘In such and such a year (or rain, varsha) we did it; in such and such a year (or rain) we did it.’ The rains, then, are one of the forms of manifestation (rûpa) of all seasons [^711]; and when people say, ‘To-day it is as if in summer,’ then that is in the rainy season; and when they say, ‘To-day it is as if in spring,’ then that, too, is in the rainy season. From the year (or rain, varsha), indeed, (is named) the rainy season (varshâ<i>h</i>).

<span id="v2_2_3_88"><sup><small>2:2:3:88.</small></sup></span>  There is, moreover, an occult form (through which the rains manifest themselves in the seasons) [^712]. When it blows from the east, then that is the characteristic sign of spring:—when it thunders, it is that of <span id="p316"><sup><small>[ p. 316 ]</small></sup></span> summer;—when it rains, it is that of the rainy season; when it lightens, it is that of autumn [^713];—when it ceases to rain, it is that of winter. The rains are all the seasons. The seasons he (Agni) entered: from out of the seasons, therefore, he now produces him.

<span id="v2_2_3_99"><sup><small>2:2:3:99.</small></sup></span>  But the sun also is all the seasons: when he rises, then it is spring;—when the cows are driven together (for milking), then it is summer;—when it is mid-day, then is the rainy season;—when it is afternoon, then it is autumn;—when he sets, then it is winter. At mid-day (madhyandina), therefore, he should establish his fires, for then that (sun) is nearest to this world, and hence he produces that (fire) from the nearest centre (madhya).

<span id="v2_2_3_1010"><sup><small>2:2:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  Verily, this man is affected with evil, as with a shadow. But then (at mid-day) that (evil) of his (like his shadow) is smallest, and shrinks, as it were, beneath his foot: hence he thereby crushes that evil, when it is smallest. For this reason also he should establish his fires (the second time) at mid-day.

<span id="v2_2_3_1111"><sup><small>2:2:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  He takes it out (from the Gârhapatya) by means of sacrificial grass. By means of fire-wood, indeed, he takes it out the first time; and (were he to take it out) with fire-wood the first time, and with fire-wood the second time, he would commit a repetition, and raise a conflict. Now sacrificial grass means water, and the rainy season also means water. He (Agni) entered the seasons: with water he accordingly produces him from out of the waters; this is why he takes it (the fire) out by means of sacrificial grass.

<span id="v2_2_3_1212"><sup><small>2:2:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  Having prepared an (ordinary) rice cake on <span id="p317"><sup><small>[ p. 317 ]</small></sup></span> two arka [^714] leaves, he puts it in the place where he is about to establish the Gârhapatya fire, and thereon lays down the Gârhapatya.

<span id="v2_2_3_1313"><sup><small>2:2:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  Having prepared a (second) barley cake on two arka leaves, he puts it in the place where he is about to establish the Âhavanîya fire, and thereon lays down the Âhavanîya. \[Some do so\] arguing, ‘Thereby we cover them with the first two fires;’ but let him not do so, for it is by the nights that they come to be covered.

<span id="v2_2_3_1414"><sup><small>2:2:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then offers to Agni a sacrificial cake (puro<i>d</i>âsa) on five potsherds [^715]. Its offering prayers and invitatory prayers consist of paṅkti strophes of five pâdas each [^716]; for there are five seasons, and the seasons he (Agni) entered: from the seasons he accordingly produces him.

<span id="v2_2_3_1515"><sup><small>2:2:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  The whole (sacrifice) belongs to Agni; for it was thereby that Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> entered Agni's beloved abode, and therefore the whole (sacrifice) belongs to Agni [^717]. <span id="p318"><sup><small>[ p. 318 ]</small></sup></span> 2:2:3:1616\. They perform it (with the formulas pronounced) in a low voice; for if one wishes to prepare anything specially for a relative or friend, one must take care to keep it secret. Now the other sacrifice belongs to all the deities, but this belongs specially to Agni; and what is (kept) secret, that is (spoken of) in a low voice: this is why they perform it in a low voice.

<span id="v2_2_3_1717"><sup><small>2:2:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  The last after-offering he performs aloud; for then he has completed his work, and every one becomes aware of what has been done.

<span id="v2_2_3_1818"><sup><small>2:2:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  Having uttered his call (and having been responded to by the Âgnîdhra) [^718], he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Samidhs (kindling-sticks)!’—the latter being one of Agni's mystic forms of manifestation (rûpa); but he may also say, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fires!’—that being Agni's real (exoteric) form [^719]. <span id="p319"><sup><small>[ p. 319 ]</small></sup></span> 2:2:3:1919\. He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites [^720], ‘. . . They (the Samidhs), O Agni, may accept of the butter! Vau<i>gh</i>ak [^721]!’ ‘. . . He (Tanûnapât) may accept the fire of the butter! Vau<i>gh</i>ak!’ ‘. . . . They (the I<i>d</i>s) may, through Agni, accept of the butter! Vau<i>gh</i>ak!’ ‘. . . It (the barhis), the fire, may accept of the butter! Vau<i>gh</i>ak!’

<span id="v2_2_3_2020"><sup><small>2:2:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  He then says [^722], ‘Svâhâ Agnim!’ with reference to Agni's butter-portion;—‘Svâhâ Agnim Pavamânam!’ if they determine upon (offering to) Agni, the blowing [^723]; or ‘Svâhâ Agnim Indumantam!’ if they determine upon Agni, the drop-abounding [^724];—‘Svâhâ Agnim!’—‘Svâhâ, the butter-drinking Agnis! May Agni graciously accept of the butter!’—this is the offering-prayer he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces.

<span id="v2_2_3_2121"><sup><small>2:2:3:2121.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) then says, with regard to Agni's (first) butter-portion, ‘Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!’ He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites [^725], ‘Awake Agni with praise, enkindling the immortal, that he may take our offerings to the gods!’ For, indeed, when Agni is removed (from the hearth) [^726], he, as it were, sleeps: he (the priest) now awakens, rouses <span id="p320"><sup><small>[ p. 320 ]</small></sup></span> him. For the offering-prayer he recites, ‘May Agni graciously accept of the butter!’

<span id="v2_2_3_2222"><sup><small>2:2:3:2222.</small></sup></span>  And, if they determine upon (offering the second butter-portion to (Agni Pavamâna, let him then say, ‘Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Pavamâna;’ and he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites (Rig-veda IX, 16, 19), ‘O Agni, thou breathest forth life; produce thou food and sap for us! drive far away misfortune!’ For thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni. Pavamâna (the one that becomes purified) means the Soma; but this (Soma-element) they eliminate from the butter-portion of Soma [^727]. For the offering-prayer he recites, ‘May Agni Pavamâna graciously accept of the butter!’

<span id="v2_2_3_2323"><sup><small>2:2:3:2323.</small></sup></span>  If, on the other hand, they determine upon (offering to) Agni Indumat, let him say, ‘Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Indumat!’ He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites (Rig-veda VI, 16, 16), ‘Come hither, I will gladly sing to thee yet other songs, O Agni! mayest thou grow strong by these draughts (indu, drop).’ Thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni: the draught doubtless means Soma, but this (Soma-element) they eliminate from the butter-portion of Soma. For the offering-prayer he recites, ‘May Agni, the drop-abounding, graciously accept of the butter!’ And thus he makes it all of the nature of Agni.

<span id="v2_2_3_2424"><sup><small>2:2:3:2424.</small></sup></span>  He then says, as to the chief offering (havis), ‘Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!’ ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!’ ‘Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (the maker of good offerings)!’ ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer <span id="p321"><sup><small>[ p. 321 ]</small></sup></span> to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t [^728]!’ Then where (otherwise) he would say, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods [^729]!’ he now says, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Agnis!’

<span id="v2_2_3_2525"><sup><small>2:2:3:2525.</small></sup></span>  He recites [^730], '\[The divine Barhis\] may accept (the offering) for Agni's abundant obtainment of abundant gift! Vau<i>gh</i>ak!‘—’\[The divine Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa\] may accept (the offering) for abundant obtainment, in Agni, of abundant gift! Vau<i>gh</i>ak!'—‘The divine Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t . . . .’ this third (after-offering) is already in itself of the nature of Agni; and thus he makes the after-offerings relate to Agni.

<span id="v2_2_3_2626"><sup><small>2:2:3:2626.</small></sup></span>  Those same case-forms (of agni) [^731], which he recites in the offering-prayers, are six; namely, four at the fore-offerings, and two at the after-offerings. Now there are six seasons; and the seasons he (Agni) entered: out of the seasons he accordingly thereby produces him.

<span id="v2_2_3_2727"><sup><small>2:2:3:2727.</small></sup></span>  There are either twelve or thirteen syllables (in these six case-forms) [^732]. Now there are either twelve or thirteen months in a year [^733]; and the <span id="p322"><sup><small>[ p. 322 ]</small></sup></span> year, the seasons, he (Agni) entered: out of the seasons he accordingly thereby produces him. In order to avoid sameness, no two (of these forms) are alike; but (the fault of) sameness he would undoubtedly commit, were any two of them alike. The characteristic form of the fore-offerings is (alternately), ‘May they accept,’ ‘May it (or he) accept [^734];’ and that of the after-offerings is, ‘For the abundant obtainment of abundant gift.’

<span id="v2_2_3_2828"><sup><small>2:2:3:2828.</small></sup></span>  The priests' fee for this (sacrifice) consists of gold [^735], This sacrifice belongs to Agni, and gold is Agni's seed [^736]: this is why the priests' fee consists of gold. Or it may be an ox; for the latter is of the nature of Agni as far as its shoulder is concerned, since its shoulder (by carrying the yoke) is as if burnt by fire. Moreover, Agni is oblation-bearer to the gods, and that (ox) bears (or draws, loads) for men: this is why an ox may be given as the priests' fee.

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### II. THE AGNIHOTRA OR MORNING AND EVENING LIBATIONS; AND THE AGNY-UPASTHÂNA OR HOMAGE TO THE FIRES.

<span id="v2_2_4_11"><sup><small>2:2:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Pra<i>g</i>âpati alone, indeed, existed here in the beginning. He considered, ‘How may I be reproduced?’ <span id="p323"><sup><small>[ p. 323 ]</small></sup></span> He toiled and performed acts of penance. He generated Agni from his mouth; and because he generated him from his mouth, therefore Agni is a consumer of food: and, verily, he who thus knows Agni to be a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.

<span id="v2_2_4_22"><sup><small>2:2:4:22.</small></sup></span>  He thus generated him first (agre) of the gods; and therefore (he is called) Agni, for agni (they say) is the same as agri. He, being generated, went forth as the first (pûrva); for of him who goes first, they say that he goes at the head (agre). Such, then, is the origin and nature of that Agni.

<span id="v2_2_4_33"><sup><small>2:2:4:33.</small></sup></span>  Pra<i>g</i>âpati then considered, ‘In that Agni I have generated a food-eater for myself; but, indeed, there is no other food here but myself, whom, surely, he would not eat.’ At that time this earth had, indeed, been rendered quite bald; there were neither plants nor trees. This, then, weighed on his mind.

<span id="v2_2_4_44"><sup><small>2:2:4:44.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon Agni turned towards him with open mouth; and he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) being terrified, his own greatness departed from him. Now his own greatness is his speech: that speech of his departed from him. He desired an offering in his own self, and rubbed (his hands); and because he rubbed (his hands), therefore both this and this (palm) are hairless. He then obtained either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;—but, indeed, they are both milk.

<span id="v2_2_4_55"><sup><small>2:2:4:55.</small></sup></span>  This (offering), however, did not satisfy him, because it had hairs mixed with it. He poured it away (into the fire), saying, ‘Drink, while burning (osha<i>m</i> dhaya)!’ From it plants sprang: hence their name ‘plants (oshadhaya<i>h</i>).’ He rubbed (his hands) a second time, and thereby obtained another <span id="p324"><sup><small>[ p. 324 ]</small></sup></span> offering, either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;—but, indeed, they are both milk.

<span id="v2_2_4_66"><sup><small>2:2:4:66.</small></sup></span>  This (offering) then satisfied him. He hesitated: ‘Shall I offer it up? shall I not offer it up?’ he thought. His own greatness said to him, ‘Offer it up!’ Pra<i>g</i>âpati was aware that it was his own (sva) greatness that had spoken (âha) to him; and offered it up with ‘Svâhâ!’ This is why offerings are made with ‘Svâhâ!’ Thereupon that burning one (viz. the sun) rose; and then that blowing one (viz. the wind) sprang up; whereupon, indeed, Agni turned away.

<span id="v2_2_4_77"><sup><small>2:2:4:77.</small></sup></span>  And Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having performed offering, reproduced himself, and saved himself from Agni, Death, as he was about to devour him. And, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, reproduces himself by offspring even as Pra<i>g</i>âpati reproduced himself; and saves himself from Agni, Death, when he is about to devour him.

<span id="v2_2_4_88"><sup><small>2:2:4:88.</small></sup></span>  And when he dies, and when they place him on the fire, then he is born (again) out of the fire, and the fire only consumes his body. Even as he is born from his father and mother, so is he born from the fire. But he who offers not the Agnihotra, verily, he does not come into life at all: therefore the Agnihotra should by all means be offered.

<span id="v2_2_4_99"><sup><small>2:2:4:99.</small></sup></span>  And as to that same birth from out of doubt,—when Pra<i>g</i>âpati doubted, he, while doubting, remained steadfast on the better (side), insomuch that he reproduced himself and saved himself from Agni, Death, when he was about to devour him: so he also who knows that birth from out of doubt, when he doubts about anything, still remains on the better (side).

<span id="v2_2_4_1010"><sup><small>2:2:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  Having offered, he rubbed (his hands). Thence <span id="p325"><sup><small>[ p. 325 ]</small></sup></span> a Vikaṅkata [^737] tree sprung forth; and therefore that tree is suitable for the sacrifice, and proper for sacrificial vessels. Thereupon those (three) heroes among the gods were born, viz. Agni, that blower (Vâyu), and Sûrya: and, verily, whosoever thus knows those heroes among the gods, to him a hero is born.

<span id="v2_2_4_1111"><sup><small>2:2:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  They then said, ‘We come after our father Pra<i>g</i>âpati: let us then create what shall come after us!’ Having enclosed (a piece of ground), they sang praises with the gâyatrî stanza without the ‘Hiṅ [^738]:’ and that (with) which they enclosed was the ocean; and this earth was the praising-ground (âstâva).

<span id="v2_2_4_1212"><sup><small>2:2:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  When they had sung praises, they went out towards the east, saying, ‘We (will) go back thither!’ The gods came upon a cow which had sprung into existence. Looking up at them, she uttered the sound ‘hiṅ.’ The gods perceived that this was the ‘Hiṅ’ of the Sâman (melodious sacrificial chant); for heretofore (their song was) without the but after that it was the (real) Sâman. And as this same sound ‘Hiṅ’ of the Sâman was in the cow, therefore the latter affords the means of subsistence; and so does he afford the means of subsistence whosoever thus knows that ‘Hiṅ’ of the Sâman in the cow.

<span id="v2_2_4_1313"><sup><small>2:2:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Auspicious, indeed, is what we have produced here, who have produced the cow: for, truly, she is the sacrifice, and without her no sacrifice is performed; she is also the food, for the cow, indeed, is all food.’

<span id="v2_2_4_1414"><sup><small>2:2:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  This (word ‘go’), then, is a name of those <span id="p326"><sup><small>[ p. 326 ]</small></sup></span> (cows), and so it is of the sacrifice: let him, therefore, repeat [^739] it, (as it were) saying, ‘Good, excellent!’ and, verily, whosoever, knowing this, repeats it; (as it were) saying, ‘Good, excellent!’ with him those (cows) multiply, and the sacrifice will incline to him.

<span id="v2_2_4_1515"><sup><small>2:2:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  Now, Agni coveted her: ‘May I pair with her,’ he thought. He united with her, and his seed became that milk of hers: hence, while the cow is raw, that milk in her is cooked (warm); for it is Agni's seed; and therefore also, whether it be in a black or in a red (cow), it is ever white, and shining like fire, it being Agni's seed. Hence it is warm when first milked; for it is Agni's seed.

<span id="v2_2_4_1616"><sup><small>2:2:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  They (the men) said, ‘Come, let us offer this up!’—‘To whom of us shall they first offer this?’ (said those gods).—‘To me!’ said Agni.—‘To me!’ said that blower (Vâyu).—‘To me!’ said Sûrya. They did not come to an agreement; and not being agreed, they said, ‘Let us go to our father Pra<i>g</i>âpati; and to whichever of us he says it shall be offered first, to him they shall first offer this.’ They went to their father Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and said, ‘To whom of us shall they offer this first?’

<span id="v2_2_4_1717"><sup><small>2:2:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  He replied, ‘To Agni: Agni will forthwith cause his own seed to be reproduced, and so you will be reproduced.’ ‘Then to thee,’ he said to Sûrya; ‘and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that shall belong to that blower <span id="p327"><sup><small>[ p. 327 ]</small></sup></span> (Vâyu)!’ And, accordingly, they in the same way offer this (milk) to them till this day: in the evening to Agni, and in the morning to Sûrya; and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that, indeed, belongs to that blower.

<span id="v2_2_4_1818"><sup><small>2:2:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  By offering, those gods were produced in the way in which they were produced, by it they gained that victory which they did gain: Agni conquered this world, Vâyu the air, and Sûrya the sky. And whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, he, indeed, is produced in the same way in which they were then produced, he gains that same victory which they then gained;—indeed, he shares the same world with them, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra. Therefore the Agnihotra should certainly be performed.

## Footnotes

[^694]: 302:1 Previously to the performance of the full-offering, the other fires (if there are any more) are laid down. An integral part of the laying down of the Sabhya, or hall-fire, which seems to have been kept up only by Kshatriyas, is a game of dice, played by the priests, with a cow, offered by the sacrificer, for the stake. On an ox-hide, spread north of the sacrificial ground, they place a brass vessel upside down, and on it throw four times five cowries (or, if such are not to be had, five sticks) with ‘Even I win, uneven thou art won (or defeated)!’

[^695]: 302:2 The pûr<i>n</i>âhuti, or ‘full-offering,’ is an oblation of a spoonful of clarified butter. Kâty. IV. 10, 5, and comm., supply the following particulars, applying to all ordinary <i>g</i>uhoti-offerings: He puts butter into the butter-pot and places it on the Gârhapatya to p. 303 melt. Having then wiped the dipping-spoon (sruva) and offering-spoon (<i>g</i>uhû) with sacrificial grass in the manner described at I, 3, 1, 6 seq., and taken the butter-pot off the fire, and strained the butter with the two stalks of darbha serving as strainers, he fills the <i>g</i>uhû with the sruva. He now takes one stick, steps over to the north side of the Âhavanîya fire, strews grass around it, and puts the stick on the fire. He then sits down with bent right knee, and, while the sacrificer takes hold of him from behind, he pours the spoonful of butter into the fire with ‘Svâhâ!’ the sacrificer pronouncing the dedicatory formula (tyâga), ‘This to Agni!’

[^696]: 303:1 After the full-offering the sacrificer breaks the silence, imposed on him, by the words, ‘I give a boon,’ Kâty. IV, 10, 6; presents, p. 304 according to the commentary, being then made to the Adhvaryu and the Brahman. This ceremony is succeeded by the silent performance of the Agnihotra.

[^697]: 304:1 The pûr<i>n</i>âhuti, which marks the close of the Agnyâdheya proper, is followed by the Agnihotra, performed with the texts pronounced in a low voice. Not less than twelve days after the Agnyâdheya (if at all)—the three fires being kept up during the interval—the young householder has to get performed for him (on the model of the new and full-moon offering, mutatis mutandis, there being neither the uddhara<i>n</i>a, or taking out of fire from the Gârhapatya, nor the choosing of a Brahman, &c.) the three ish<i>t</i>is mentioned above. At the first ish<i>t</i>i, the special havis (sacrificial dish) consists of a rice-cake on eight potsherds for Agni Pavamâna;—at the second of two such cakes for Agni Pâvaka and Agni Su<i>k</i>i respectively;—at the third of a potful of boiled rice for Aditi. The three havis of the first two ish<i>t</i>is being (according to Taitt. Br. I, 1, 6, 3) considered as representing the three bodies (tanu) of Agni; these offerings are called tanûhavir-ish<i>t</i>is. They are, however, also called Pavamânesh<i>t</i>is. At these the name of the recipient (Agni Pavamâna, &c.) has to be pronounced in a low voice in the formulas used at the chief offering. The Taitt. Br. mentions, besides, the usual Indrâgni cake (of the new-moon sacrifice) which is to be offered before the offering to Aditi.

[^698]: 304:2 Sâya<i>n</i>a, on Taitt. Br. I, 1, 5, 10, takes pavamâna as ‘pure’ or ‘purified by himself’ (svaya<i>m</i> <i>s</i>riddha); pâvaka as ‘purifying (others);’ and <i>s</i>u<i>k</i>i as ‘shining.’

[^699]: 306:1 Viz. the practice of performing the full-offering only, see par. 5. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads: Tad vâ etat samânam eva sad viparyastam iva.

[^700]: 307:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text remarks that the anuvâkyâs (invitatory prayers) and yâ<i>g</i>yâs (offering prayers) at the three offerings of cake are in the gâyatrî metre; and such indeed is the case. The anuvâkyâs of the oblations to Agni Pavamâna, Agni Pâvaka, and Agni <i>S</i>u<i>k</i>i are Rig-veda IX, 66, 19; I, 12, 10; and VIII, 44, 21 respectively: and the yâ<i>g</i>yâs are IX, 66, 21; V, 26, 1; and VIII, 44, 17 respectively; all of which are gâyatrî stanzas. See Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. II, 1, 20-25. Cf. also I, 7, 2, 15, with note. At the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of these two ish<i>t</i>is also both formulas are in the gâyatrî metre: the puro’nuvâkyâs being Rig-veda III, 11, 2, and III, 11, 6; and the yâ<i>g</i>yâs III, 11, 1, and I, 1, 1 respectively.

[^701]: 307:2 Pra<i>k</i>yavata iva vâ esho ’smâl lokât . . . imân hi lokân samârohann eti. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has: ‘For he who takes out these oblations makes his self, as it were, depart from this world of men for the world of the gods, since he, as it were, moves rising upwards (ûrdhva iva hi samârohann eti).’ Cf. paragraphs 14-16.

[^702]: 307:3 For these (virâ<i>g</i>) sa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>ye, or invitatory and offering prayers at the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, see [p. 164](../Book_1_1_6#p164), note [2](../Book_1_1_6#fn381).—Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. II, 1, 29.

[^703]: 308:1 According to the Kâ<i>n</i>va recension, the anuvâkyâ and yâ<i>g</i>yâ, in that case, should consist of the verses containing the word mûrdhan (‘head’), viz. Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 14, 15; cf. <i>S</i>at. Br. I, 6, 2, 12.

[^704]: 309:1 Viz. at the tanûhavir-ish<i>t</i>is together, or at least three cows at each ish<i>t</i>i if there are two ish<i>t</i>is. The greater the gift, the greater the merit. According to the Paddhati on Katy. IV, so, he is also to entertain a hundred Brâhmans at the end of the performance. See also Taitt. Br. I, 1, 7, 9-11.

[^705]: 310:1 That is, ‘they convey him to the celestial world,’ as reads the otherwise identical passage in IV, 3, 4, 4.

[^706]: 310:2 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has ‘svarge loke.’

[^707]: 311:1 ‘Pra tv evâsurebhyo bravâmeti.’—‘Hantâsurebhya<i>h</i> pratiprabravâmeti,’ Kâ<i>n</i>va text. ? ‘Let us talk them out of it!’

[^708]: 311:2 See [p. 297](../Book_1_2_1#p297), note [4](../Book_1_2_1#fn684).

[^709]: 312:1 This paragraph is somewhat obscure. The Kâ<i>n</i>va recension has the following more explicit paragraphs instead:—As to this, there is a source of anxiety (âgas) to some, fearing that ‘it (that fire) might go out (anvagan).’ But let him not heed this, for, assuredly, that fire of his, which has been established in his innermost soul, does not go out. ‘The carriage might pass through (vyayâsît), the cart might pass through;—it (or some one) may come between (me and the fire)!’ such is another source of anxiety to some; but let him not heed this either; for, assuredly, the carriage does not pass through, the cart does not pass through that fire of his which has been established in his innermost soul. Cf. XII, 4, 1, 2-3.

[^710]: 313:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has: He said, ‘Speak ye not thus; be thou a restrainer of speech!’—‘Speak ye not,’ so (he said); for, having established the two fires, one should not speak untruthfully (m<i>ri</i>shâ), nor should he who utters speech speak untruthfully. He should, therefore, strive to speak nothing but the truth.

[^711]: 313:2 If the householder who has set up his fires, finds, after a year or more, that he does not prosper in his undertakings, or if he has otherwise met with misfortunes, and thus his âdheya has not proved successful, he should set up his fires a second time. The old fires have to be put out, either early in the day on which the performance is to take place, or from three nights to a whole year previous to the ceremony. With the exceptions noticed in the sequel, the performance is the same as that of the âdhâna.

[^712]: 314:1 Compare the corresponding legend Taitt, S. I, 5, 1; according to which the gods deposited their precious goods (vâma<i>m</i> vasu) with Agni; and Pûshan and Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, on performing sacrifice to Agni exclusively (the punarâdhyeya), became possessed of the cattle, whence the latter are said to belong to Pûshan (paush<i>n</i>a) and to Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> (tvâsh<i>t</i>ra). Afterwards Manu and Dhât<i>ri</i> (here identified with the year) also performed the ceremony. See also <i>S</i>at. Br. II, 3, 4, 1 seq.

[^713]: 314:2 Or, since it is to Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> that all form belongs.

[^714]: 315:1 <i>G</i>yotir amutra pu<i>n</i>yalokatvâ, lit, ‘a light by (way of) blissful state.’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has the same reading.

[^715]: 315:2 This speculation is based on the identity of the words for year (varsha; also ‘rain’) and the rains, or rainy season (varshâ<i>h</i>).

[^716]: 315:3 The characteristics of the seasons here selected are supposed to have a special connection with the rain and rainy season.

[^717]: 316:1 During the autumn, or sultry season succeeding the rains, there are frequent displays of sheet-lightning along the horizon at night.

[^718]: 317:1 Calotropis Gigantea. These cakes (apûpa, not puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a, have first to be cooked either on the Avasathya, or on a secular fire. Before the cakes are then put on the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fire-places, the latter have to be consecrated in the usual way (cf. p. 2); and, after the putting on of the cakes, the fire-places are sprinkled by the Adhvaryu, while the sacrificer holds on to him from behind. Katy. IV, 11, 8, Schol.

[^719]: 317:2 Viz. he performs an ish<i>t</i>i with such a rice-cake for the havis, as a substitute for the tanûhavir-ish<i>t</i>is, offered after the full-offering, at the âdhâna. See II, 2, 1, 6, and note.

[^720]: 317:3 The paṅkti consists of five octosyllabic pâdas. The anuvâkyâ and yâ<i>g</i>yâ at the chief offering are Rig-veda IV, 10, 2 and 4; those of the svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, ib., verses 4 and 1.—Â<i>s</i>v. II, 8, 14.

[^721]: 317:4 The offering prayers of all libations and offerings at this ish<i>t</i>i must therefore contain Agni's name. At each of the fore-offerings and after-offerings a different case-form of agni is added after the respective objects of those offerings,—thus, ‘. . . samidho agne p. 318 ’gna â<i>g</i>yasya vyantu,’ ‘tanûnapâd agnim agna . . .,’ ‘i<i>d</i>o agninâgne . . .,’ &c. See par. 19; also [p. 148](../Book_1_1_5#p148), n. [2](../Book_1_1_5#fn360); I, 5, 4, 1 seq.; I, 8, 2, 1 seq. The two butter-portions otherwise offered to Agni or Soma respectively (cf. I, 6, 1, 20 seq.) are in this case offered to Agni; the anuvâkyâs, according to Â<i>s</i>v. II, 8, 7, being Rig-veda VIII, 44, I, and VI, 16, 16 respectively. See, however, paragraphs 21 seq.

[^722]: 318:1 Viz. the Adhvaryu calls, Õ <i>s</i>râvaya, ‘cause (him or one) to hear!’ and the Âgnîdhra responds by Astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>, ‘yea, may he (or one) hear!’

[^723]: 318:2 Here, at the first fore-offering, an option is apparently left between the former, regular summons (see I, 5, 3, 8), and the latter, modified so as to make it apply directly to Agni. Katy. IV, 11, 11 allows the same option for the first prayâ<i>g</i>a and anuyâ<i>g</i>a. For the latter, however, see further on, par. 24. The Kâ<i>n</i>va recension has as follows:—Now when the Adhvaryu, on stepping over (to the south side) and uttering his call (for the Âgnîdhra) to bid attention, says, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Samidhs!’ then that, indeed, is one of Agni's forms of manifestation (âgneyam eva tad rûpam); but here let him say, as it were, p. 319 in a mystic way, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Agnis!’ (paroksham iva tv agnîn ya<i>g</i>eti haiva tatra brûyât.)

[^724]: 319:1 See [p. 317](#p317), note [^717].

[^725]: 319:2 A modification of the ordinary vausha<i>t</i>. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has here and in par. 25, as usual, vaushal.

[^726]: 319:3 At the fifth fore-offering; see I, 5, 3, 22 seq.

[^727]: 319:4 See II, 2, 1, 6, and note; also II, 2, 1, 22.

[^728]: 319:5 This points forward to the second butter-portion, which is offered to Agni Pavamâna or Agni Indumat, instead of Soma; the first being offered to Agni simply. Kâty. IV, 11, I2.

[^729]: 319:6 Rig-veda V, 14, 1. See, however, the formulas prescribed by Â<i>s</i>valâyana, [p. 317](#p317), note [^717].

[^730]: 319:7 The fire laid down at the âdheya is removed when the punarâdheya is to be performed.

[^731]: 320:1 Viz. that second butter-portion which by right belongs to Soma (see I, 6, 1, 20 seq.), but is here offered to Agni.

[^732]: 321:1 For the formulas of the chief offering and Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, see [p. 317](#p317), note [^716].

[^733]: 321:2 That is, at the altar-offerings; see I, 8, 2, 14. Cf. also [p. 318](#p318), note [^719].

[^734]: 321:3 See I, 8, 2, 15. Here a different case-form of the word agni (viz. agne<i>h</i> and agnau) is inserted in the offering-formulas of the first two anuyâ<i>g</i>as, immediately after the word indicating the object of the offering; the formula of the third and last anuyâ<i>g</i>a already containing the nominative agni<i>h</i> in the same place.

[^735]: 321:4 See [p. 317](#p317), note [^717].

[^736]: 321:5 The locative case agnau, inserted in the offering-prayer of the second after-offering, is optionally made trisyllabic by being written and pronounced agnâ-u.

[^737]: 321:6 For other allusions to intercalary months in the Vedic texts, see Weber, Naxatra, II, p. 336.

[^738]: 322:1 See I, 5, 3, 35.

[^739]: 322:2 See also II, 2, 4, 15. In Taitt. S. I, 5, 12 (referred to Kâty. XI, 2, 37) ‘white gold’ (ra<i>g</i>ata<i>m</i> hira<i>n</i>yam), i.e. silver, is expressly mentioned as unsuitable for the dakshi<i>n</i>â. The reason adduced is that, when the gods claimed back the goods deposited with Agni, he wept, and the tears he shed became silver; and hence, if one were to give silver as a dakshi<i>n</i>â, there would be weeping in his house before a year had passed.

[^740]: 322:3 See II, 1, 1, 5.

[^741]: 325:1 The sruva, or dipping-spoon, and the Agnihotra ladle, for instance, are made of this wood; see [p. 331](../Book_1_2_3#p331), note [2](../Book_1_2_3#fn746).

[^742]: 325:2 On ‘hiṅ’ as an essential element in the recitation of Sâma-chants, see I, 4, 1, 1 seq.

[^743]: 326:1 Pariharet \[? ‘let him avoid it (the term go in the sense of sacrifice), thinking that it is too holy’\]. Sâya<i>n</i>a merely remarks, that both the cow and the sacrifice are here represented as extremely auspicious (utk<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>am pu<i>n</i>yam). Perhaps we have here a play on the words upanâma, ‘a by-name,’ and upanâmuka, ‘inclining to (him).’ ‘Go’ (for go-sh<i>t</i>oma) is the designation of one of the days of the Abhiplava at the Gavâmayana.
