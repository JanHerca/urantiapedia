## THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### INSTALLATION AND CONSECRATION OF AGNI.

<span id="v9_3_1_11"><sup><small>9:3:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake). That Agni has now been completely restored; he now is that deity, (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara (belonging to all men): to him he offers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him a deity, for whatever deity an oblation is prepared that is a deity, but not one for whom no (oblation) is prepared. It is one of twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the year.

<span id="v9_3_1_22"><sup><small>9:3:1:22.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he offers the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake),—it is as the Vai<i>s</i>vânara that he is about to produce that Agni: on that former occasion, at the initiation-offering [^347], he pours him out in the form of seed: and what the seed is like that is poured. <span id="p208">[<sup><small>p. 208</small></sup>]</span> into the womb, such like (is the child that) is born; and inasmuch as there he pours out Vai<i>s</i>vânara in the form of seed, therefore he now is born as Vai<i>s</i>vânara. Silently [^348] it is (performed) there, for there seed (is implied) in the sacrifice, and silently seed is infused; but distinctly on the present occasion, for distinct (manifest) is the seed when born.

<span id="v9_3_1_33"><sup><small>9:3:1:33.</small></sup></span>  Now, that Vai<i>s</i>vânara is all these worlds: this earth is the All (vi<i>s</i>va), and Agni is its man (nara); the air is the All, and Vâyu (the wind) is its man (ruler); the sky is the All, and Âditya (the sun) is its man.

<span id="v9_3_1_44"><sup><small>9:3:1:44.</small></sup></span>  And these worlds are the same as this head,—this (lower part of the head) is the earth, the plants (being) the hair of its beard: this is the All, and Agni is Speech, he is the man. That (speech) is at the top thereof, for Agni is on the top of this (earth).

<span id="v9_3_1_55"><sup><small>9:3:1:55.</small></sup></span>  This (central part of the face) is the air, whence it is hairless, for hairless, as it were, is the air; it is this All, and Vâyu (the wind) is the breath, he is the man; he is in the middle thereof, for the wind is in the middle of the air.

<span id="v9_3_1_66"><sup><small>9:3:1:66.</small></sup></span>  The sky is the (upper part of the) head, and the stars are the hair; it is the All, and Âditya (the sun) is the eye, he is the man: it is in the lower part of the (upper) head, for the sun is below the sky. Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the head thereof, and this built-up Agni (the altar) is the body: thus, having completed his body, he restores the head thereto.

<span id="v9_3_1_77"><sup><small>9:3:1:77.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the (cakes) to the Maruts;— <span id="p209">[<sup><small>p. 209</small></sup>]</span> the Maruts’ (cakes) are the vital airs: he thus puts the vital airs into him (Agni). \[He does so\] after offering the Vai<i>s</i>vânara; for the Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the head: he thus puts vital airs into the head.

<span id="v9_3_1_88"><sup><small>9:3:1:88.</small></sup></span>  That (Vai<i>s</i>vânara oblation) is a single one, for single, as it were, is the head; the others (viz. the Mârutas) are seven in number, of seven potsherds each; and though ‘seven-seven’ means ‘many times,’ here it is only seven [^349]: he thus places seven vital airs in the head.

<span id="v9_3_1_99"><sup><small>9:3:1:99.</small></sup></span>  That (Vai<i>s</i>vânara oblation) is (performed in a) distinct (voice), for the head is distinct; but indistinct the other (oblations), for indistinct, as it were, are the vital airs. Standing he offers the former, for the head stands, so to speak; sitting the others, for the vital airs are, so to speak, seated.

<span id="v9_3_1_1010"><sup><small>9:3:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  Now, the first two Mâruta (oblations) he offers are these two vital airs (in the ears): he offers them in the middle [^350] of the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (oblations), for these two vital airs are in the middle of the head.

<span id="v9_3_1_1111"><sup><small>9:3:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  And the second pair are these two (vital airs <span id="p210">[<sup><small>p. 210</small></sup>]</span> in the eyes); he offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two vital airs.

<span id="v9_3_1_1212"><sup><small>9:3:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  And the third pair are these two (vital airs in the nostrils). He offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two vital airs. The one to be recited in the forest [^351] is speech: it is to be recited in the forest, for by speech one gets into much terrible (trouble).

<span id="v9_3_1_1313"><sup><small>9:3:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he offers the Vai<i>s</i>vânara and Mârutas,—the Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the ruling power (chieftaincy), and the Mârutas are the clan: he thus sets up both the chief and the clan. The Vai<i>s</i>vânara he offers first: thus, having set up the chief, he sets up the clan.

<span id="v9_3_1_1414"><sup><small>9:3:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  The former is a single (oblation): he thus makes the ruling power (chieftaincy) to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan.

<span id="v9_3_1_1515"><sup><small>9:3:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  The former is (offered in a) distinct (voice), for the ruling power is something distinct, so to speak; and the others are indistinct, for indistinct, so to speak, is the clan. Standing he offers the former, for the ruling power (the chief) stands, so to speak; and sitting (he offers) the others, for the clan sits, so to speak.

<span id="v9_3_1_1616"><sup><small>9:3:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  The former he offers with the offering-ladle, <span id="p211">[<sup><small>p. 211</small></sup>]</span> when the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered, with both an invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ) and an offering-formula (yâ<i>g</i>yâ); with the hand the others sitting, with the Svâhâ-call: he thus makes the clan subservient and obedient to the chieftain.

<span id="v9_3_1_1717"><sup><small>9:3:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘How do these (Mâruta oblations) also come to be offered for him by the offering-ladle, at the Vasha<i>t</i>\-call, and with invitatory and offering formulas?’ Well, the first three feet of those seven-footed Mâruta (verses), being a three-footed Gâyatrî, are the invitatory formula, and the last four, being a four-footed Trish<i>t</i>ubh, are the offering-formula. The one is the bowl, and the other the handle (of the offering-ladle), and the Svâhâ-call is the Vasha<i>t</i>\-call: in this way, then, these (Mâruta oblations) also become offered for him by the offering-ladle, at the Vasha<i>t</i>\-call, and with invitatory and offering-formulas.

<span id="v9_3_1_1818"><sup><small>9:3:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  And the first Mâruta (cake) which he offers on the right (south) side, is the seven (rivers) which flow eastwards. It is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven of. those (rivers) which flow eastwards.

<span id="v9_3_1_1919"><sup><small>9:3:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  And the first (cake) which he offers on the left (north) side, is the seasons; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven seasons.

<span id="v9_3_1_2020"><sup><small>9:3:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  And the second (cake) which he offers on the right side, is animals; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven domestic animals. He offers it close to the preceding one (representing the rivers): he thus settles animals near water.

<span id="v9_3_1_2121"><sup><small>9:3:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  And the second (cake) which he offers on the left side, is the seven <i>Ri</i>shis; it is one of seven potsherds, for the seven <i>Ri</i>shis are seven in number. <span id="p212">[<sup><small>p. 212</small></sup>]</span> He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus establishes the seven <i>Ri</i>shis in the seasons.

<span id="v9_3_1_2222"><sup><small>9:3:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  And the third (cake) which he offers on the right side, is the vital airs; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven vital airs in the head. He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus puts the vital airs so as to be close to (not separated from) the head.

<span id="v9_3_1_2323"><sup><small>9:3:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  And the third (cake) which he offers on the left side, is the metres; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven metres increasing by four (syllables respectively). He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus places the metres close to the <i>Ri</i>shis.

<span id="v9_3_1_2424"><sup><small>9:3:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  And the Ara<i>n</i>yeऽnû<i>k</i>ya is the seven (rivers) which flow westwards; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven of those (rivers) which flow westwards. It is that downward vital air of his. That Ara<i>n</i>yeऽnû<i>k</i>ya belongs to this Pra<i>g</i>âpati; for the forest (ara<i>n</i>ya) is, as it were, concealed, and concealed, as it were, is that downward vital air; whence those who drink of these (downward flowing) rivers become most vile, most blasphemous, most lascivious in their speech. Whenever he here speaks of them as belonging to the Maruts, he makes them food for him (Agni) [^352] and offers it to him, and gratifies him thereby.

<span id="v9_3_1_2525"><sup><small>9:3:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  That Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake), doubtless, is yonder sun, and the Mâruta (cakes) are those rays. They are of seven potsherds each, for the troops of the Maruts consist of seven each. <span id="p213">[<sup><small>p. 213</small></sup>]</span> 9:3:1:2626\. He offers (the first Mâruta cake), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 80), ‘The clear-lighted, and the bright- lighted, and the true-lighted, and the light, and the clear, and the law-observing, and the sinless one!’—these are their names: having completed that disk (of the sun, in the shape of the Vai<i>s</i>vânara), he bestows those rays on it by calling them by their names.


<span id="v9_3_2"><sup><small>9:3:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

#### THE SHOWER OF WEALTH AND OTHER OBLATIONS.

<span id="v9_3_2_11"><sup><small>9:3:2:11.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon [^353] he (the Sacrificer [^354]) offers the Vasor dhârâ. That whole Agni has now been completed, and he is here the Vasu (good one): to that Vasu the gods offered this shower (dhârâ), whence it is called ‘Vasor dhârâ [^355];’ and in like manner this (Sacrificer) offers to him this shower, and gratifies him thereby.

<span id="v9_3_2_22"><sup><small>9:3:2:22.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he offers the ‘Vasor dhârâ;’—this is his (Agni's) Abhisheka [^356]; for the <span id="p214">[<sup><small>p. 214</small></sup>]</span> gods, having now completed him wholly and entirely, showered upon him those wishes (or, objects of desire), this ‘Vasor dhârâ;’ and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has completed him wholly and entirely, shower upon him those wishes, this ‘Vasor dhârâ.’ With ghee taken in five ladlings, and an offering-ladle of udumbara wood (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_3_2_33"><sup><small>9:3:2:33.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers it\] after offering the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake)—for the Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the head, and food is taken in from the head. (downwards); and, besides, it is from the head (downwards) that he who is anointed is anointed;—and after offering the Mâruta (cakes), for the Mârutas are the vital airs, and through (the channels of) the vital airs food is eaten; and, besides, it is at (the openings of) the vital airs that he who is anointed is anointed [^357].

<span id="v9_3_2_44"><sup><small>9:3:2:44.</small></sup></span>  And, furthermore, (it is offered) upon the Ara<i>n</i>yeऽnû<i>k</i>ya [^358]; for the Ara<i>n</i>yeऽnû<i>k</i>ya is speech, and it is through (the channel of) speech that food is eaten; and, besides, it is with speech that he who <span id="p215">[<sup><small>p. 215</small></sup>]</span> is anointed is anointed. And everything here is wealth (vasu), for all these (cake-offerings) are (connected with special) wishes [^359]; and in order that this shower, be it of milk or of ghee, (may be) fraught with wealth, this oblation of ghee is thus offered for the beginning; and inasmuch as this shower is fraught with wealth, it is called ‘shower of wealth.’

<span id="v9_3_2_55"><sup><small>9:3:2:55.</small></sup></span>  He (as it were) says, ‘This is mine, and that is mine;’—that is, ‘Herewith I gratify thee, and therewith;—herewith I anoint thee, and therewith;’ or, ‘Give me this, and that!’ And as soon as that shower reaches the fire, that prayer is fulfilled.

<span id="v9_3_2_66"><sup><small>9:3:2:66.</small></sup></span>  Now the gods, having gratified him (Agni) by this food, or by these objects of desire [^360], and having anointed him by this shower of wealth, solicited from him these objects of desire [^361]; and having received offering, and being gratified and anointed, he granted them these objects of desire; and in like manner this (Sacrificer), having gratified him by this food, and by these offerings of desire, and anointed him with this shower of wealth, now solicits from him these objects of desire; and having received offering, and being gratified and anointed, he (Agni) grants him these objects of desire. In order to avoid discontinuance, he each time embraces two wishes,—even as one would connect those living away from one another,—thinking, ‘In this way shall they prosper by sacrifice!’

<span id="v9_3_2_77"><sup><small>9:3:2:77.</small></sup></span>  The gods now spake, ‘Through whom shall we receive these objects of desire? By our own <span id="p216">[<sup><small>p. 216</small></sup>]</span> self,’ they said; for the sacrifice is the self of the gods, and so is the sacrifice that of the Sacrificer; and when he says, ‘By the sacrifice they shall prosper!’ he means to say, ‘By my own self they shall prosper!’

<span id="v9_3_2_88"><sup><small>9:3:2:88.</small></sup></span>  In twelve (things) he causes them to prosper [^362], the year consists of twelve months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him, and by so much food he thus consecrates him. In fourteen he causes them to prosper; in eight he causes them to prosper; in ten he causes them to prosper; in thirteen he causes them to prosper.

<span id="v9_3_2_99"><sup><small>9:3:2:99.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the Ardhendra (libations) [^363];the ardhendras are everything here [^364]: he thus gratifies him (Agni) with everything, and with everything he thus consecrates him.

<span id="v9_3_2_1010"><sup><small>9:3:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then offers (the libations relating to) the Grahas [^365];\—the grahas (cups of soma, offered to <span id="p217">[<sup><small>p. 217</small></sup>]</span> the deities), doubtless, are sacrifice: by sacrifice, by food, he thus gratifies him; and by sacrifice he thus consecrates him.


<span id="v9_3_3"><sup><small>9:3:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v9_3_3_11"><sup><small>9:3:3:11.</small></sup></span>  He then offers these Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>akratus [^366] (sacrificial rites), with,‘ May the Agni and the Gharma (prosper) for me!’—by these sacrificial rites he thus gratifies him, and by these sacrificial rites he thus consecrates him.

<span id="v9_3_3_22"><sup><small>9:3:3:22.</small></sup></span>  He then offers (the libations relating to) the Uneven Stomas [^367];—for the gods, having now obtained their desires, by means of the uneven Stomas went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, now that he has obtained all his desires, by means of the uneven Stomas go up to heaven.

<span id="v9_3_3_33"><sup><small>9:3:3:33.</small></sup></span>  Now this (set runs) up to the thirty-three-versed (hymn-form), for the Trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a is the last of the uneven Stomas: at the last the gods thus <span id="p218">[<sup><small>p. 218</small></sup>]</span> went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby at the last go up to heaven.

<span id="v9_3_3_44"><sup><small>9:3:3:44.</small></sup></span>  He then offers (those relating to) the Even (Stomas) [^368];—for the metres then said, ‘The uneven stomas are worn out, by means of the even ones we will go up to heaven!’ By means of the even stomas they went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thus, by means of the even stomas, go up to heaven.

<span id="v9_3_3_55"><sup><small>9:3:3:55.</small></sup></span>  This (set runs) up to the forty-eight-versed (hymn-form), for the Ash<i>t</i>â<i>k</i>atvâri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a is the last of the even stomas: at the last the metres thus went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby at the last go up to heaven.

<span id="v9_3_3_66"><sup><small>9:3:3:66.</small></sup></span>  He says, ‘May the One and the Three (prosper) for me!’—‘May the Four and the Eight (prosper) for me!’—even as one climbing a tree would climb up by taking hold of an ever higher branch, so is this. And as to why he offers the Stomas,—the stomas are food: it is with food he thus consecrates him.

<span id="v9_3_3_77"><sup><small>9:3:3:77.</small></sup></span>  He then offers (the libations relating to) the Age-grades [^369] (of cattle),—age-grades mean cattle: it is by cattle, for his food, that he thus gratifies <span id="p219">[<sup><small>p. 219</small></sup>]</span> him; and by cattle, for his food, he thus consecrates him.

<span id="v9_3_3_88"><sup><small>9:3:3:88.</small></sup></span>  He then offers whilst mentioning names [^370];—for the gods, having obtained all their wishes, now gratified him directly; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having obtained all his wishes, now gratify him directly. ‘To Strength, hail! to Gain, hail!’—these are his (Agni's) names: it is by mentioning his names that he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v9_3_3_99"><sup><small>9:3:3:99.</small></sup></span>  There are thirteen of these names,—a year consists of thirteen months, and the layers and fillings of the fire-altar amount to thirteen: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus gratifies him. And as to why he offers while mentioning names,—it is thus in mentioning his (Agni's) names that he consecrates him.

<span id="v9_3_3_1010"><sup><small>9:3:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then says, ‘This is thy realm; a supporter and sustainer art thou for the friend: for sustenance, for rain, for the lordship of creatures (do I consecrate) thee;’—sustenance, doubtless, means food, and rain means food: by food he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v9_3_3_1111"><sup><small>9:3:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  And when he says, ‘This is thy realm; a supporter and sustainer art thou for the friend: for sustenance, for rain, for the lordship of creatures—thee!’ this is to say, 'This is thy kingdom; thou art consecrated (anointed)! thou art thy friend's supporter and sustainer: for our sustenance art thou, for rain unto us art thou, for our lordship of <span id="p220">[<sup><small>p. 220</small></sup>]</span> creatures art thou!' They thereby entreat him, ‘For all this art thou unto us: for all this have we consecrated thee!’ And therefore people thus entreat a human king who has been consecrated.

<span id="v9_3_3_1212"><sup><small>9:3:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the Prospering [^371] (libations);—the prospering (libations) are the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus puts into him.—‘May the vital strength prosper by sacrifice! may the vital air prosper by sacrifice! . . .’ He thus puts proper vital airs into him.

<span id="v9_3_3_1313"><sup><small>9:3:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  Twelve prospering (libations) he offers,—a year consists of twelve months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts proper vital airs into him. And as to why he offers the prospering (libations),—the prospering (libations) are vital airs, and the vital airs are the immortal element: with the immortal element he thus consecrates him.

<span id="v9_3_3_1414"><sup><small>9:3:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then says, ‘The Stoma, and the Ya<i>g</i>us, and the <i>Ri</i>k, and the Sâman, and the B<i>ri</i>hat, and the Rathantara,’—this, doubtless, is the triple science, and the triple science is food: it is with food he thus gratifies him, and with food he thus consecrates him;—‘to the heavenly light we gods have gone, we have become immortal,’—for he indeed goes to the heavenly light, and becomes immortal;—'Pra<i>g</i>âpati's children have we become!'—for he indeed becomes Pra<i>g</i>âpati's child,—‘ve<i>t</i>! svâhâ!’—the Ve<i>t</i>\-call, doubtless, is <span id="p221">[<sup><small>p. 221</small></sup>]</span> esoterically the same as the Vasha<i>t</i>\-call, and either with the Vasha<i>t</i>\-call, or the Svâhâ-call is food offered to the gods: he thus gratifies him by both the Vasha<i>t</i> and the Svâhâ, and also consecrates him by both of them. He now throws the offering-ladle after (the ghee into the fire) lest what there is anointed with ghee should remain outside of the fire.

<span id="v9_3_3_1515"><sup><small>9:3:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  Now as to this same shower of wealth, the body (from which it flows) is the sky, the udder the cloud, the teat the lightning, and the shower (of ghee) is the (rain-) shower: from the sky it comes to the cow.

<span id="v9_3_3_1616"><sup><small>9:3:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  Its body is the cow, its udder the (cow's) udder, its teat the (cow's) teat, its shower the shower (of milk): from the cow (it comes) to the Sacrificer.

<span id="v9_3_3_1717"><sup><small>9:3:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  Its body is the Sacrificer, its udder his arm, its teat the offering-ladle, its shower (of milk) the shower of (ghee): from the Sacrificer (it goes) to the gods; from the gods to the cow, from the cow to the Sacrificer: thus circulates this perpetual, never-ending food of the gods. And, verily, for whosoever knows this, there will thus be perpetual, never-ending food. Now as to the (mystic) correspondence.

<span id="v9_3_3_1818"><sup><small>9:3:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘How does this wealth-shower of his obtain (conformity with) the year, and Agni? how does it correspond to the year, to Agni?’ Well, this shower of wealth consists of three hundred and sixty (libations), and of (other) six, and of thirty-five. Now, the three hundred and sixty which there are,—so many being the days in the year,—thereby it obtains the days of the year. And what six there are,—the seasons being <span id="p222">[<sup><small>p. 222</small></sup>]</span> six in number,—thereby it obtains the nights of the seasons: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And what thirty-five there are, they are the (intercalary) thirteenth month [^372], and that is the body,—the body (consists) of thirty (limbs), the feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing and up-breathing), and the head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year; and thus that shower of wealth of his obtains (conformity with) the year, and Agni; and thus it corresponds to the year, to Agni. And so many are the bricks with special formulas which are placed in the centre of a <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ila fire-altar; for these bricks indeed are the same as these different Agnis [^373]; and thus these Agnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the shower of wealth.

<span id="v9_3_3_1919"><sup><small>9:3:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘How does this shower of wealth of his attain to (conformity with) the Great Litany, how does it correspond to the Great Litany?’ Well, the first nine formulas of this shower of wealth are the threefold [^374] head; and the forty-eight which follow are the twenty-four-fold wings [^375]; and the twenty-five which follow are the twenty-five-fold body [^376]; and the twenty-one which follow are the tail, as the twenty-first [^377]; and the <span id="p223">[<sup><small>p. 223</small></sup>]</span> thirty-five which follow are the Va<i>s</i>a (hymn); and by the eighties (of verses) which follow those eighties (Of the mahad uktham) are obtained, for by eighties the Great Litany is counted; and what there is after the eighties, that to him (corresponds to) what, in the Great Litany, there is after the eighties [^378]; and thus this shower of wealth of his attains to (conformity with) the Great Litany, and corresponds to the Great Litany.

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v9_3_4_11"><sup><small>9:3:4:11.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya [^379] (set of fourteen libations),—‘vâ<i>g</i>a’ (strength, sustenance) means food (anna): it thus is an ‘anna-prasavîya’ for him, and it is food he thereby raises (pra-sû) for him (Agni).

<span id="v9_3_4_22"><sup><small>9:3:4:22.</small></sup></span>  For the gods, now that they had gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, (to wit) by that stream of wealth [^380], hereby gratified him once more; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, that shower of wealth, hereby gratify him once more. <span id="p224">[<sup><small>p. 224</small></sup>]</span> 9:3:4:33\. And, again, as to why he offers the Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya. This, to be sure, is his (Agni's) Abhisheka. For, the gods, having gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, (to wit) by that shower of wealth, then by this (offering) consecrated him once more; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), having gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, that shower of wealth, hereby consecrate him once more.

<span id="v9_3_4_44"><sup><small>9:3:4:44.</small></sup></span>  It consists of (seeds of) all (kinds of) plants,—that which consists of all plants is all food: he thus gratifies him with all food, and with all food he thus consecrates him. Let him set aside one of these kinds of food, and not eat thereof as long as he lives. With an udumbara (ficus glomerata) cup [^381] and an udumbara dipping-spoon (he offers): the significance of these two has been explained. They are both four-cornered,—there are four quarters: he thus gratifies him with food from every quarter, and by means of food from every quarter he thus consecrates him.

<span id="v9_3_4_55"><sup><small>9:3:4:55.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he performs the Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya;—he thereby gratifies those same deities who have been consecrated by this very rite of consecration by which he is now about to be consecrated, and, thus gratified by offering, they grant him permission (to perform) this rite of consecration, and, permitted by them, he becomes consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow to assume the royal dignity, but not he whom <span id="p225">[<sup><small>p. 225</small></sup>]</span> they do not (allow to do so). Thus when he offers in the fire he consecrates Agni, and when he offers to these deities, he gratifies those gods who rule over this consecration ceremony.

<span id="v9_3_4_66"><sup><small>9:3:4:66.</small></sup></span>  And, indeed, he offers here also the Pârtha [^382] (oblations);—for the gods now desired, ‘May we be consecrated even on this occasion by all the rites of consecration!’ They were indeed consecrated on this occasion by all the rites of consecration; and in like manner is the Sacrificer on this occasion consecrated by all the rites of consecration.

<span id="v9_3_4_77"><sup><small>9:3:4:77.</small></sup></span>  Now these Pârtha (oblations) are the Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya; and by offering these (oblations) he is consecrated by the Râ<i>g</i>asûya; and the first seven of the succeeding fourteen (Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya oblations) are the Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya ceremony of the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya [^383]: thus, by offering these he is consecrated by the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya. And what other seven there are, they belong to Agni (or, the Agni<i>k</i>ayana): by offering these, he is consecrated by the Agni-consecration.

<span id="v9_3_4_88"><sup><small>9:3:4:88.</small></sup></span>  He first offers those of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, then those of the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya; for by performing the Râ<i>g</i>asûya one becomes king (râ<i>g</i>â) and by the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya emperor (samrâ<i>g</i>), and the position of king is (obtained) first, and thereafter that of <span id="p226">[<sup><small>p. 226</small></sup>]</span> emperor [^384]: hence after performing the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, one could not perform the Râ<i>g</i>asûya,—it would be a descent, just as if one who is emperor were to become king.

<span id="v9_3_4_99"><sup><small>9:3:4:99.</small></sup></span>  Those (seven Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya oblations) of the fire-altar he offers last, for the Agni-consecration indeed is (equal to) all those rites of consecration, and he who is consecrated by the Agni-consecration rite becomes everything, king and emperor: therefore he offers those of the fire-altar last of all.

<span id="v9_3_4_1010"><sup><small>9:3:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then anoints him on a black antelope skin,—for the black antelope skin is (a symbol of) the sacrifice: it is thus at the sacrifice that he anoints him. On the hairy side (of the skin),—for the hairs are the metres: on the metres he thus anoints him. On the left (north) side (of the fire-altar he anoints him): the significance of this (will be explained) further on. On (the skin laid down) with the neck-part towards the front, for that (tends) godwards.

<span id="v9_3_4_1111"><sup><small>9:3:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  Some, however, anoint him on the right (south) side of the fire-altar, on the ground that it is from the right side that food is served, and that they thus anoint him from the food-side. But let him not do so, for that (southern) region belongs to the Fathers, and quickly he goes to that region whom they anoint in that way.

<span id="v9_3_4_1212"><sup><small>9:3:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  And some, indeed, anoint him on the Âhavanîya, on the ground that the Âhavanîya is the world of heaven, and that they thus anoint him in the world of heaven. But let him not do so, for that (Âhavanîya, the fire-altar,) is his (the Sacrificer's) <span id="p227">[<sup><small>p. 227</small></sup>]</span> divine body, and this (Sacrificer, or Sacrificer's real body) is his human one: they thus attach that divine body of his to this his mortal body, if they anoint him in this way.

<span id="v9_3_4_1313"><sup><small>9:3:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  Let him anoint him on the left (north) side and nowhere else, for that north-eastern region belongs to both gods and men: they thus anoint him whilst seated and established in his own region, for he who is established in his own seat suffers no injury.

<span id="v9_3_4_1414"><sup><small>9:3:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  One who has gained a position in the world should be anointed sitting, for one who has gained a position is seated, so to speak;—and one who is striving to gain one standing, for one who wishes to gain a position, stands, so to speak. On a he-goat's skin should be anointed one desirous of prosperity, on a black-antelope skin one desirous of spiritual lustre, on both (kinds of skins) one desirous of both: that (skin) he spreads north of the tail (of the fire-altar) with its hair uppermost and its neck-part towards the east.

<span id="v9_3_4_1515"><sup><small>9:3:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  Close to the enclosing-stones [^385]: inasmuch as the black-antelope skin is close to the enclosing-stones, so that divine body of his is consecrated on the black-antelope skin; and inasmuch as he is consecrated whilst keeping hold of the fire-altar he is not cut off from that divine consecration (of the Fire).

<span id="v9_3_4_1616"><sup><small>9:3:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  He anoints him after making offering on the fire-altar, for that (altar) is his divine body, and <span id="p228">[<sup><small>p. 228</small></sup>]</span> this (Sacrificer himself) is his human one; and the gods indeed were first, and thereafter the men: therefore, after making offering, he anoints him with what remains over of that same (offering-material) [^386]. He then throws the dipping-spoon after (the oblations into the fire).

<span id="v9_3_4_1717"><sup><small>9:3:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  Placing himself near the (Sacrificer's) right arm, he then anoints him [^387], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 3-7), ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, I anoint thee, by the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, by the hands of Pûshan, by the support of Sarasvatî Vâ<i>k</i>, the supporter, by the universal sovereignty of Agni!’—for Sarasvatî is Vâ<i>k</i> (speech), and hers is all this support. Impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>, he thus anoints him by all this support of Sarasvatî Vâ<i>k</i>, the supporter, and by the universal sovereignty of Agni. Here he throws the cup (into the fire), lest what is anointed (with offering material) should remain outside the fire.

<span id="v9_3_4_1818"><sup><small>9:3:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  He anoints him h the middle of the Pârtha oblations, for the Pârtha oblations are the year: he thus places him in the middle of the year. Six he offers before, and six after (the consecration ceremony), for there are six seasons: by the seasons he thus encloses (guards) him who is consecrated on both sides. B<i>ri</i>haspati is the last of the first (six [^388]), and Indra the first of the <span id="p229">[<sup><small>p. 229</small></sup>]</span> last (six),—B<i>ri</i>haspati is the priesthood (or priestly office), and Indra is the nobility (or political power): by the priesthood and the nobility he thus encloses him who is consecrated on both sides.

## Footnotes

[^353]: 207:1 Cp. VI, 6, 1, 6. Whilst the initiation-offering of the ordinary Soma-sacrifice consists only of a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, that of the Agni<i>k</i>ayana requires two further oblations, viz. a cake on twelve potsherds to Vai<i>s</i>vânara, and a rice-pap with ghee to the Âdityas; cf. part iii, p. 247 note.

[^354]: 208:1 Or, rather, in a low voice, the name of the deity being pronounced in an undertone while the oblation is poured into the fire; see VI, 6, 1, 11. No special formula is, however, used on either occasion.

[^355]: 209:1 See [VIII, 1, 1, 2](Book_4_8_1#v8_1_1_2). Also VI, 5, 3, 11, where the translation should be altered accordingly.

[^356]: 209:2 In baking the cakes, the Vai<i>s</i>vânara is placed on the centre of the fire, and the first two Mâruta cakes are placed north and south of it, then the following pair of cakes behind the first, but more closely together, and behind these the third pair, still more closely together, and finally the last cake forming, as it were, the apex of a phalanx of Mâruta cakes (or wind-deities) protecting (that of) Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara. In offering the cakes a similar method is to be followed; except that the first pair of Mâruta cakes may be offered, not in the fire itself, but on the previously flattened out Vai<i>s</i>vânara cake lying on the fire. Whilst the Kâtîya-sûtra (XVIII, 4, 23) admits this as an alternative mode (though not very clearly expressed), our passage seems to require it as the only possible mode. Both the Vai<i>s</i>vânara and the Mâruta cakes are offered whole.

[^357]: 210:1 ‘Ara<i>n</i>yeऽnû<i>k</i>ya’ is the technical term applied to the odd, or seventh, Mâruta oblation. According to Sâya<i>n</i>a it is so called after an anuvâka of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, to be recited only in the forest. Possibly, however, it is to the particular formula (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXIX, 7), also called ‘vimukha’ (? to be pronounced ‘with averted face’), and containing the names of the seven most terrible Maruts, that the name applies.

[^358]: 212:1 Probably, inasmuch as the Maruts (and the Mâruta oblations) represent the clansmen who are considered the legitimate ‘food’ or the chief, Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara.

[^359]: 213:1 That is, after offering all the seven Mâruta cakes, the formulas of the last six of which (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 81-85; XXXIX, 7) are not given in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a. At the end the Adhvaryu mutters the verse XVII, 86, and thereupon he either makes the Sacrificer mutter (or mutters himself) verses 87-99 in praise of Agni. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XVIII, 4, 25; 26.

[^360]: 213:2 Thus, according to Kâty. XVIII, 5, 1 (the Adhvaryu, according to Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 283).

[^361]: 213:3 It would rather seem to mean ‘stream, or shower, of wealth;’ cf. [paragraph 4](Book_4_9_3#v9_3_2_4).

[^362]: 213:4 That is, the consecration ceremony, in which the king is sprinkled' with sacred water, or, so to speak, anointed. The ‘Vasor dhârâ,’ or ‘shower of wealth,’ consisting of an uninterrupted series of 401 libations to Agni (through which all the powers of the god are to be secured to the Sacrificer), is intended as the p. 214 equivalent of that ceremony for the consecration of Agni as king; and, indeed, as a kind of superior consecration ceremony for the (royal) Sacrificer himself, more potent than the Râ<i>g</i>asûya and Vâ<i>g</i>apeya. There is thus to be noticed here the same tendency as elsewhere of exalting the efficacy of the Agni<i>k</i>ayana, and of making it take the place of the whole of the ordinary sacrificial ceremonial.

[^363]: 214:1 When anointed, or consecrated, the king is first sprinkled from the front and then from behind, and finally rubbed all over, with the consecrated water; see V, 4, 2, 1 seq.

[^364]: 214:2 That is, as soon as the Adhvaryu has put the Ara<i>n</i>yeऽnû<i>k</i>ya cake in the fire the Sacrificer begins to pour the ghee on it with a large offering-ladle of udumbara wood, and the Adhvaryu begins to mutter the formulas.

[^365]: 215:1 Or, all these (objects) for which offerings are made are objects of desire.

[^366]: 215:2 Or, perhaps, ‘for (prompted by) these objects of desire.’

[^367]: 215:3 Or, asked him these wishes (boons).

[^368]: 216:1 That is, he makes the objects of desire mentioned in the formulas used during the Vasor dhârâ, accrue to himself, or turn out well for himself. The formulas usually contain the names of twelve such objects (in six pairs), those in XVIII, 1 being—‘(may) strength and gain, endeavour and attempt, thought and wisdom, sound and praise, fame and hearing, light and heaven, prosper for (or accrue to) me by sacrifice!’ In XVIII, 4, however, fourteen objects are enumerated, in XVIII, 15 (and 27) eight, in XVIII, 23 (and 26). ten, in XVIII, 28 thirteen.

[^369]: 216:2 Literally, ‘the half-Indra ones,’ the technical term for the formulas of three sets of libations (XVIII, 16-18), in which three sets of twelve deities are named, each pair of whom consists of Indra coupled with some other deity, thus ‘May Agni and Indra, Soma and Indra, &c., prosper for (or accrue to) me by sacrifice!’

[^370]: 216:3 Viz. inasmuch as Indra represents the ruling power, and everything submits to him (III, 9, 4, 15); or inasmuch as Indra and Agni are the whole universe (IV, 2, 2, 14).

[^371]: 216:4 These are three sets of libations (still forming part of the continuous p. 217 ‘Vasor dhârâ,’ or ‘wealth-stream’), the formulas of which (XVIII, 19-21) enumerate each six pairs of cups of Soma (graha) and of sacrificial implements.

[^372]: 217:1 These are two sets of libations in the formulas of which (XVIII, 22; 23) objects connected with ‘special sacrifices’ are enumerated. Thus, of the first pair, ‘Agni and Gharma,’ ‘Agni,’ according to Mahîdhara, represents either the Agni<i>k</i>ayana or the Agnish<i>t</i>oma (ordinary Soma-sacrifice); whilst the ‘Gharma (cauldron)’ stands for the Pravargya offering (part i, p. 44 note).

[^373]: 217:2 The formula of this set of libations (XVIII, 24) enumerates the seventeen uneven numbers (in the feminine gender) from 1 to 33, repeating the second number of each pair, so as to be the first number of the next pair (thus, 1 and 3, 3 and 5, &c.). These numbers are meant to represent the corresponding Stomas, consisting of an uneven number of verses, up to the Trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, or thirty-three-versed hymn-form.

[^374]: 218:1 The formula of this set of libations (XVIII, 25) enumerates (the twelve quadruples of 4 (in the feminine gender), from 4 to 48 again repeating each number, except the first and last), as representing the Stomas consisting of an even number of verses, up to the Ash<i>t</i>â<i>k</i>atvâri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, or forty-eight-versed hymn-form.

[^375]: 218:2 The two formulas relating to these two sets of libations (XVIII, 26; 27) contain respectively five and four pairs of teams of cattle of different ages, beginning with ‘tryavi and tryavî,’ ‘an eighteen-months bull and an eighteen-months cow;’ and ending with ‘a bullock and a milch cow.’

[^376]: 219:1 This set of thirteen libations (XVIII, 28) is offered to the months Vâ<i>g</i>a, Prasava, &c., here apparently considered as manifestations of Agni (the year). Each name is followed by ‘svâhâ (hail!);’ and the last of these dedicatory formulas is followed by the special benedictory formula, referred to in [paragraph 10](Book_4_9_3#v9_3_3_10).

[^377]: 220:1 This final set of twelve (? sixteen) libations is called thus (kalpa), because, in the formulas used with them (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 29), the verb ‘k<i>li</i>p (to prosper, to be right and proper)’ is repeated each time. At the conclusion of these twelve formulas the priest mutters the final benediction given in full in [paragraph 14](Book_4_9_3#v9_3_3_14).

[^378]: 222:1 See [p. 167](Book_4_9_1#p167), note [1](Book_4_9_1#fn283).

[^379]: 222:2 Viz. the different forms, or powers, of Agni, to which the 401 libations are offered. See [IX, 1, 1, 43](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_43), where the very same calculations are applied to the <i>S</i>atarudriya.

[^380]: 222:3 See [p. 114](Book_4_8_6#p114), note [1](Book_4_8_6#fn207).

[^381]: 222:4 Paksha, wing, also means half-month, fortnight, of which there are twenty-four in the year.

[^382]: 222:5 See [p. 168](Book_4_9_1#p168), note [3](Book_4_9_1#fn287).

[^383]: 222:6 Apparently in addition to the fingers and toes (? of monkeys).

[^384]: 223:1 See pp. [110](Book_4_8_6#p110), note [3](Book_4_8_6#fn202); [112](Book_4_8_6#p112), n. [1](Book_4_8_6#fn204); [113](Book_4_8_6#p113), n. [1](Book_4_8_6#fn206).

[^385]: 223:2 That is, oblations capable of promoting or quickening strength (or food,—vâ<i>g</i>a); see part iii, p. 37 (where read Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya). While the formulas of the first seven of these oblations are the same as those used for those of the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya (see V, 2, 2, 5-11), the formulas of the last seven of these oblations are Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 30-36 (for the first of which, being the same as IX, 5, see VI, 1, 4, 4).

[^386]: 223:3 This seems to be in apposition to both ‘that food,’ and ‘those objects of desire.’

[^387]: 224:1 Or, pan. It has a handle, and serves on this occasion in place of the offering-ladle as well as for anointing the Sacrificer.

[^388]: 225:1 In the same way as, at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, six Pârtha oblations were offered before, and as many immediately after, the Consecration ceremony, or ‘anointment’ (see part iii, p. 8 1 seq.), so also on the present occasion, except that, between the first six Pârthas and the consecration ceremony, the Vâ<i>g</i>aprasavîya set, referred to in the preceding paragraphs, is inserted.

[^389]: 225:2 For these seven oblations, see V, 2, 2, 6-11. Only the second set of seven thus is peculiar to the Agni<i>k</i>ayana.

[^390]: 226:1 See V, 1, 1, 12.

[^391]: 227:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a takes ‘âsp<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>am pari<i>s</i>rita<i>h</i>’ to mean ‘lightly touched (just touched) by an enclosing-stone.’ The participle would rather seem here to have an active meaning, like ‘anvârabdha’ in the same paragraph.

[^392]: 228:1 That is, with the remainder of the mess of different kinds of seed mixed with milk and water.

[^393]: 228:2 That is, by sprinkling him with the liquid, or pouring it on him.

[^394]: 228:3 The formulas of the twelve Pârtha oblations are the same as those used on the occasion of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya (V, 3, 5, 8. 9), the sixth of which is ‘To B<i>ri</i>haspati hail!’ and the seventh ‘To Indra hail!’
