## EIGHTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

#### C. THE OBLATIONS.

<span id="v3_8_1_11"><sup><small>3:8:1:11.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the Hot<i>ri</i>, having sat down on the Hot<i>ri</i>'s seat whereon he sits down after being chosen [^464], <span id="p185"><sup><small>[ p. 185 ]</small></sup></span> urges, and thus urged the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons.

<span id="v3_8_1_22"><sup><small>3:8:1:22.</small></sup></span>  They then proceed with the Âprî (verses). The reason why they proceed with the Âprîs is this. With his whole mind, with his whole self, forsooth, he who consecrates himself prepares and endeavours to prepare the sacrifice. His self is, as it were, emptied out; with those Âprîs they fill it again; and because they fill [^465] it therewith, therefore they are called Âprî. For this reason they proceed with the Âprîs.

<span id="v3_8_1_33"><sup><small>3:8:1:33.</small></sup></span>  Now there are here eleven fore-offerings; for here in man there are ten vital airs, and the eleventh is the self wherein those vital airs are contained; this is the whole man; thus they fill his whole self, and therefore there are eleven fore-offerings.

<span id="v3_8_1_44"><sup><small>3:8:1:44.</small></sup></span>  \[The Adhvaryu\] having called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite to) the kindling-sticks [^466]!’ Thus he proceeds with ten fore-offerings, <span id="p186"><sup><small>[ p. 186 ]</small></sup></span> saying, ‘Prompt . . .’ at each, and pouring the ghee together at every fourth fore-offering [^467]. Having performed ten fore-offerings, he says, ‘Bring the slayer!’ ‘Slayer,’ namely, the (butcher's) knife is called.

<span id="v3_8_1_55"><sup><small>3:8:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He then takes the (svaru) chip of the sacrificial stake, and having anointed both (the slaughtering-knife and the chip) at the top (with ghee) from the guhû-spoon, he touches the forehead of the victim with them, saying (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 11), ‘Anointed with ghee, protect ye the animals!’ for the chip of the stake is a thunderbolt, and the slaughtering-knife is a thunderbolt, and ghee is a thunderbolt; having thus fitted together the entire thunderbolt [^468] he appoints it the keeper of this (victim), lest the evil spirits should injure it. He again conceals the chip of the stake (under the girding-rope of the stake). In handing the slaughtering-knife to the butcher, he says, ‘Be this thine approved edge!’ and deposits the two spoons.

<span id="v3_8_1_66"><sup><small>3:8:1:66.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite to Agni circumambient [^469]!’ Having taken a firebrand, <span id="p187"><sup><small>[ p. 187 ]</small></sup></span> the Agnîdh carries the fire round (the victim). Why he carries the fire round, is that he encircles it (the victim) by means of the fire with an unbroken fence, lest the evil spirits should seize upon it; for Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas; therefore he carries the fire round. He carries it round the place where they cook it (the victim [^470]).

<span id="v3_8_1_77"><sup><small>3:8:1:77.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘Let him take back that firebrand (to the Âhavanîya); and having there (at the <i>S</i>âmitra) churned out a new fire, let them cook it (the victim) thereon. For this (firebrand), surely, is âhavanîya (fit to offer upon); it is not for the purpose that they should cook uncooked (food) thereon, but for this that they should sacrifice cooked (food) thereon.’

<span id="v3_8_1_88"><sup><small>3:8:1:88.</small></sup></span>  Let him, however, not do this. For in that he carries fire round it, it (the victim) becomes as food swallowed by that (firebrand), and it would be as if he were to seize and tear out food that has been swallowed and offer it to some one else; let them, therefore, crumble some coals off that same firebrand, and thereon cook that (victim).

<span id="v3_8_1_99"><sup><small>3:8:1:99.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the Agnîdh, taking a (new) firebrand, walks in front: whereby he places Agni in front, thinking, ‘Agni shall repel the evil spirits in front!’ and <span id="p188"><sup><small>[ p. 188 ]</small></sup></span> they lead the victim after him (to the slaughtering-place) on a (way) free from danger and injury. The Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> holds on to it from behind by means of the two spits [^471], and the Adhvaryu (holds on to) the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>, and the Sacrificer to the Adhvaryu.

<span id="v3_8_1_1010"><sup><small>3:8:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘That (victim) must not be held on to by the sacrificer, for they lead it unto death; therefore let him not hold on to it.’ But let him nevertheless hold on to it; for that (victim) which they lead to the sacrifice they lead not to death; therefore let him hold on to it. Moreover he would cut himself off from the sacrifice, were he not to hold on to it; therefore let him hold on to it. It is held on to in a mysterious way; by means of the spits the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> (holds on to it); to the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> the Adhvaryu, to the Adhvaryu the Sacrificer; thus then it is held on to in a mysterious way.

<span id="v3_8_1_1111"><sup><small>3:8:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered altar, and having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘O Hot<i>ri</i>, prompt again (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite for) the offerings to the gods [^472]!’ This is what belongs to the All-gods at the animal offering.

<span id="v3_8_1_1212"><sup><small>3:8:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  He then makes (the Sacrificer) say the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 11), ‘O thou prosperous! upon <span id="p189"><sup><small>[ p. 189 ]</small></sup></span> the Sacrificer,’—the prosperous one, forsooth, is Speech, it is because she speaks much, that Speech is prosperous,—‘bestow thou what is agreeable unto him! Approach thou,’—thereby he means to say, ‘Approach thou an existence free from affliction,’—‘from the wide air, along with the divine wind;’ for the Rakshas moves about the air rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as man here moves about the air rootless and unfettered on both sides: he means to say, ‘Meeting together with the wind, protect thou this one from the wide air,’ when he says ‘from the wide air, along with the divine wind.’

<span id="v3_8_1_1313"><sup><small>3:8:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  ‘Offer thou with the self of this oblation!’ whereby he means to say to Speech, ‘Offer thou with the soul of this unblemished oblation;’—‘Unite thou with its body!’ whereby he means to say to Speech, ‘Unite thou with the body of this unblemished oblation!’

<span id="v3_8_1_1414"><sup><small>3:8:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  In front [^473] of the place where they cut it up, he throws down a stalk of grass, with, ‘O great one, lead the lord of sacrifice unto greater sacrifice!’ he thus strews barhis (an underlayer of sacrificial grass) for it, that no sacrificial food may be spilt; whatever may now be spilt of it when it is cut up, that settles thereon and thus is not lost.

<span id="v3_8_1_1515"><sup><small>3:8:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  They then step back (to the altar) and sit down turning towards the Âhavanîya, ‘lest they should be eye-witnesses to its being quieted (strangled).’ They do not slay it on the frontal bone [^474], for that is human <span id="p190"><sup><small>[ p. 190 ]</small></sup></span> manner; nor behind the ear, for that is after the manner of the Fathers. They either choke it by merely keeping its mouth closed, or they make a noose. Therefore he says not, ‘Slay! kill!’ for that is human manner, but, ‘Quiet it! It has passed away!’ for that is after the manner of the gods. For when he says, ‘It has passed away,’ then this one (the Sacrificer) passes away to the gods: therefore he says, ‘It has passed away.’

<span id="v3_8_1_1616"><sup><small>3:8:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  When they hold it down, then, before the strangling, he offers with ‘Hail, to the gods!’ And when (the butcher) says, ‘Quieted is the victim,’ he offers with, ‘To the gods, Hail!’ Thus some of the gods are preceded by ‘Hail,’ and others followed by ‘Hail;’ he thereby gratifies them, and thus gratified both kinds of gods convey him to the heavenly world. These are the so-called ‘paripa<i>s</i>avya [^475]’ oblations; he may offer them if he choose; or, if he choose, he need not mind them.


<span id="v3_8_2"><sup><small>3:8:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_8_2_11"><sup><small>3:8:2:11.</small></sup></span>  When he (the slaughterer) announces, ‘The victim has been quieted!’ the Adhvaryu says, ‘Nesh<i>t</i>ar, lead up the lady!’ The Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> leads up the (sacrificer's) wife bearing a vessel of water for washing the feet.

<span id="v3_8_2_22"><sup><small>3:8:2:22.</small></sup></span>  He makes her say (Vâg . S. VI, 12), ‘Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched!’—the wide-stretched one, forsooth, is the sacrifice; for they stretch the sacrifice (over the sacrificial ground): <span id="p191"><sup><small>[ p. 191 ]</small></sup></span> hence the wide-stretched one is the sacrifice. But that wife, forsooth, is the hind-part of the sacrifice, and he wants her, thus coming forward, to propitiate the sacrifice. Thereby, then, she makes amends to that sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice does not injure her: therefore she says, ‘Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched!’

<span id="v3_8_2_33"><sup><small>3:8:2:33.</small></sup></span>  ‘Advance, unresisted!’ whereby she means to say, ‘Advance on (a way) free from injury!’ ‘Unto the rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred truth!’ whereby she means to say, ‘Unto good.’ \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 13\], ‘Ye divine, pure waters, carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods, well-prepared! May we be well-prepared preparers!’ Thereby she purifies the water.

<span id="v3_8_2_44"><sup><small>3:8:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the wife cleanses with the water the (openings of the) vital airs of the victim. The reason why she thus cleanses with water the (openings of the) vital airs is this: the food of the gods is living, is immortal (ambrosia) for the immortals; but in quieting and cutting up that victim they kill it. Now the vital airs are water; hence she now puts into it those vital airs, and thus that food of the gods becomes truly living, becomes immortal for the immortals.

<span id="v3_8_2_55"><sup><small>3:8:2:55.</small></sup></span>  Then as to why it is the wife that cleanses. The wife is a woman, and from woman progeny is born here on earth; thus he causes that (creature) to be born from that woman; and therefore the wife cleanses (the victim).

<span id="v3_8_2_66"><sup><small>3:8:2:66.</small></sup></span>  With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 14) ‘Thy speech I cleanse’ she wipes the mouth; with ‘Thy breath I cleanse,’ the nostrils; with ‘Thine eye I cleanse,’ the eyes; with ‘Thine organ of hearing I cleanse,’ the <span id="p192"><sup><small>[ p. 192 ]</small></sup></span> ears; with ‘Thy navel I cleanse,’ that mysterious (opening of a) vital air; or with ‘Thy sexual organ I cleanse;’ with ‘Thy hind-part I cleanse,’ that (opening of a) vital air behind. Thus she puts the vital airs into it, revives it. Thereupon, holding the legs together, (she wipes them) with ‘Thy feet I cleanse;’ for it is on its feet chat it stands firmly; she thus makes it stand (on its feet) for the sake of a firm position.

<span id="v3_8_2_77"><sup><small>3:8:2:77.</small></sup></span>  With one half or the whole of the water that is left, he (the Adhvaryu) and the Sacrificer [^476] then sprinkle it, beginning from the head; thereby they put those vital airs into it, and revive it (beginning) from that part.

<span id="v3_8_2_88"><sup><small>3:8:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Thus, wherever they wound it [^477], wherever they hurt it—water being a means of soothing—there they soothe it by that means of soothing, water, there they heal it with water.

<span id="v3_8_2_99"><sup><small>3:8:2:99.</small></sup></span>  They sprinkle with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 15), ‘May thy mind grow full! may thy speech grow full! may thy breath grow full! may thine eye grow full! may thine ear grow full!’ Thus they put the vital airs into it and revive it: ‘Whatever is sore, whatever hurt in thee, may that fill up and become firm.’

<span id="v3_8_2_1010"><sup><small>3:8:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  Thus, wherever they wound it, wherever they hurt it—water being a means of soothing—they soothe it by that means of soothing, water, there <span id="p193"><sup><small>[ p. 193 ]</small></sup></span> they heal it with water: ‘May that become pure in thee!’ thereby they render it sacrificially pure. With ‘Auspicious be the days!’ they pour out (the remaining water) behind the victim.

<span id="v3_8_2_1111"><sup><small>3:8:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  Thus, wherever they wound it, wherever they hurt it,—lest thereafter the days and nights should be inauspicious [^478],—they pour out (the water) behind the victim with, ‘Auspicious be the days.’

<span id="v3_8_2_1212"><sup><small>3:8:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon they turn the victim over so as to lie on its back. He (the Adhvaryu) puts the (other) stalk of grass thereon, with, ‘O plant, protect!’ for the knife is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the knife, does not injure it (the victim). He then applies the edge of the knife to it (and cuts through it) with, ‘Injure it not, O blade!’ for the knife is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the knife, does not injure it.

<span id="v3_8_2_1313"><sup><small>3:8:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  He applies that approved edge of his, for that has been made sacrificially pure by a text [^479]. That which is the top part of the stalk he puts in his left hand, and that which is the bottom part he takes with his right hand.

<span id="v3_8_2_1414"><sup><small>3:8:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  And where he skins (the victim), and whence the blood spirts out, there he smears it (the bottom part with blood) on both ends with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, I6), ‘Thou art the Rakshas’ share!‘ for that blood is indeed the Rakshas’ share.

<span id="v3_8_2_1515"><sup><small>3:8:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  Having thrown it away (on the utkara), he treads on it with, ‘Herewith I tread down the Rakshas! herewith I drive away the Rakshas! herewith I consign the Rakshas to the <span id="p194"><sup><small>[ p. 194 ]</small></sup></span> nethermost darkness!’ Thus it is by means of the sacrifice that he drives away the evil spirits, the Rakshas. And as to its being rootless and severed on both sides,—rootless, forsooth, and severed on both sides, the Rakshas moves about in the air, even as man here moves about in the air rootless and severed on both sides: therefore it (the grass-end) is rootless and severed on both sides.

<span id="v3_8_2_1616"><sup><small>3:8:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon they pull out the omentum, and envelop the two spits [^480] therein with, ‘May ye envelop heaven and earth with ghee!’ whereby he endows those two, heaven and earth, with strength and sap, and puts strength and sap into them; and upon those two, thus filled with sap and affording the means of subsistence, these creatures subsist.

<span id="v3_8_2_1717"><sup><small>3:8:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  The two omentum-spits are made of kârshmarya wood. For when the gods in the beginning seized (slew) a victim, then, as it was drawn upwards, its sacrificial essence [^481] flowed downwards, and from it sprang a tree; and because it flowed down from the (victim) as it was drawn (karsh) upwards, therefore (it became) a kârshmarya tree [^482]. With that <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> same sacrificial essence he now perfects it, and makes it whole; therefore the two omentum-spits are of kârshmarya wood.

<span id="v3_8_2_1818"><sup><small>3:8:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  He cuts it (the omentum) off on all sides (from the belly) and heats it at the cooking-fire: thus it becomes cooked for him already at this (fire) [^483]. The Agnîdh again takes a firebrand (from the <i>S</i>âmitra, and walks in front). They go behind the pit (<i>k</i>âtvâla) and proceed to the Âhavanîya. The Adhvaryu throws that (top part of the) grass-stalk into the Âhavanîya with, ‘O Vâyu, graciously accept the drops!’ for this is the kindler (samidh) of the drops [^484].

<span id="v3_8_2_1919"><sup><small>3:8:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he heats the omentum while standing on the north side; for he is about to pass by the fire and to roast (the omentum) after walking round to the south side. Hereby then he propitiates it, and thus that fire does not injure him while passing by; this is why he heats the omentum while standing on the north side.

<span id="v3_8_2_2020"><sup><small>3:8:2:2020.</small></sup></span>  They take it along between the sacrificial stake and the fire. The reason why they do not take it across the middle (of the altar) [^485], where they take other sacrificial dishes, is lest they should bring the sacrifice in the middle into contact with the uncooked (omentum). And why they do not take it there outside (the altar) along the front of the sacrificial stake, is that they would thereby put it outside the sacrifice; therefore they take it along <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> between the sacrificial stake and the fire. Having gone round to the south side, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> roasts it.

<span id="v3_8_2_2121"><sup><small>3:8:2:2121.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having taken ghee with the dipping-spoon, pours it upon the omentum, with, ‘May Agni graciously accept the ghee, Hail!’ Thus those drops thereof reach the fire after becoming cooked offerings, made with Svâhâ (hail)!

<span id="v3_8_2_2222"><sup><small>3:8:2:2222.</small></sup></span>  He then says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a [^486]), ‘Recite to the drops!’ He recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni [^487]. The reason why he recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni, is that rain originates from gifts made from this earth, for from here it is that Agni obtains the rain; by means of these drops (falling from the omentum) he obtains those (rain) drops, and those drops rain down; therefore he recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni. When it is roasted,—

<span id="v3_8_2_2323"><sup><small>3:8:2:2323.</small></sup></span>  The Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> says, ‘It is roasted: proceed [^488]!’ The Adhvaryu, having taken the two spoons and stept across (to the north side of the fire) and called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘Prompt for the Svâhâs [^489]!’ and offers (the ghee) when the Vasha<i>t</i> has been pronounced [^490]. <span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span> 3:8:2:2424\. Having offered, he bastes first the omentum, then the clotted ghee. Now the Karaka-Adhvaryus, forsooth, baste first the clotted ghee, arguing that the clotted ghee is the breath; and a <i>K</i>araka-Adhvaryu, forsooth, cursed Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya for so doing, saying, ‘That Adhvaryu has shut out the breath; the breath shall depart from him!’

<span id="v3_8_2_2525"><sup><small>3:8:2:2525.</small></sup></span>  But he, looking at his arms, said, 'These hoary arms—what in the world has become of the Brâhman's word [^491]!' Let him not heed that (objection of the Karakas); for this is the last fore-offering,—and this being a havis-offering, at the last fore-offering he first pours ghee into the dhruvâ, being about to offer the first two butter-portions with it [^492]. Now, on the present occasion, he will first offer the omentum; therefore let him first baste the omentum, then the clotted ghee. And though he does not baste the victim with ghee, ‘lest he should baste the uncooked,’ that whole victim of his yet becomes (as it were) basted with ghee in that he bastes the omentum; let him therefore first baste the omentum, then the clotted ghee.

<span id="v3_8_2_2626"><sup><small>3:8:2:2626.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he makes an ‘underlayer’ of ghee (in the <i>g</i>uhû-spoon), and lays a piece of gold thereon. Then, cutting off the omentum (from the spits and putting it into the spoon), he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma <span id="p198"><sup><small>[ p. 198 ]</small></sup></span> for the omentum and fat of the buck!’ He then lays (another) piece of gold on (the omentum) and bastes it twice with ghee above.

<span id="v3_8_2_2727"><sup><small>3:8:2:2727.</small></sup></span>  The reason why there is a piece of gold on both sides is this. When they offer the victim in the fire they slay it; and gold means immortal life: hence it (the victim) rests in immortal life. And so it rises from hence, and so it lives; for this reason there is a piece of gold [^493] on both sides. Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite the offering-prayer [^494] on) the omentum and fat of the buck for Agni and Soma!’ He does not say, ‘. . . (the omentum and fat) brought forward;’ when the Soma has been pressed he says, ‘brought forward [^495].’ He offers when the Vasha<i>t</i> has been pronounced.

<span id="v3_8_2_2828"><sup><small>3:8:2:2828.</small></sup></span>  Having offered the omentum, he lays the two spits together and throws them after (the omentum into the fire), with, ‘Consecrated by Svâhâ, go ye to Ûrdhvanabhas [^496], son of the Maruts!’ He does so, thinking, ‘Lest these two wherewith we have cooked the omentum should come to nought.’

<span id="v3_8_2_2929"><sup><small>3:8:2:2929.</small></sup></span>  The reason why they perform with the omen-tum is this. For whatever deity the victim is seized, that same deity he pleases by means of that fat (part); and that same deity, thus pleased with that fat, waits <span id="p199"><sup><small>[ p. 199 ]</small></sup></span> patiently for the other sacrificial dishes being cooked; this is why they perform with the omentum.

<span id="v3_8_2_3030"><sup><small>3:8:2:3030.</small></sup></span>  They then cleanse themselves over the pit [^497]. For in quieting and cutting up (the victim) they wound it; and water being a means of soothing, they now soothe it by means of water, heal it by means of water; therefore they cleanse themselves over the pit.


<span id="v3_8_3"><sup><small>3:8:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_8_3_11"><sup><small>3:8:3:11.</small></sup></span>  For the same deity for which there is a victim, he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake [^498]. The reason why he subsequently prepares a cake is this. Rice and barley, truly, are the sacrificial essence of all animals (victims) [^499]; with that same essence he now completes that (victim) and makes it whole. This is why he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake.

<span id="v3_8_3_22"><sup><small>3:8:3:22.</small></sup></span>  And why he proceeds with that cake after performing (offering) with the omentum is this. It is from the middle (of the victim) that this omentum is pulled out, and from the middle he now completes that (victim) by means of that sacrificial essence and makes it whole; therefore he proceeds with that cake after performing with the omentum. The relation of <span id="p200"><sup><small>[ p. 200 ]</small></sup></span> this (cake to the animal offering), indeed, is one and the same everywhere; that cake is prepared after (and supplementary to) a victim.

<span id="v3_8_3_33"><sup><small>3:8:3:33.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he cuts up the victim: ‘Move thrice [^500], and make the heart the uppermost of the thrice-moved!’ thus (he says to the slaughterer), for threefold is the sacrifice.

<span id="v3_8_3_44"><sup><small>3:8:3:44.</small></sup></span>  He then instructs the slaughterer: ‘If one ask thee, “Is the sacrificial food cooked, O <i>S</i>amitar?” say thou only “Cooked!” not “Cooked, reverend sir!” nor “Cooked, forsooth!”’ <span id="p201"><sup><small>[ p. 201 ]</small></sup></span> 3:8:3:55\. Having then taken clotted ghee with the <i>g</i>uhû, the Adhvaryu, stepping up (from the altar) to (the <i>S</i>âmitra), asks, ‘Is the sacrificial food cooked, O <i>S</i>âmitar?’ ‘Cooked,’ he says. ‘That is of the gods,’ says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.

<span id="v3_8_3_66"><sup><small>3:8:3:66.</small></sup></span>  The reason why he asks is this. Cooked, forsooth, not uncooked (must be) the gods' food; and the <i>S</i>amit<i>ri</i> indeed knows whether it is cooked or uncooked.

<span id="v3_8_3_77"><sup><small>3:8:3:77.</small></sup></span>  And again, why he asks. ‘I will perform with cooked (food),’ so he thinks; and if that sacrificial food be uncooked, it is yet cooked food for the gods, and is cooked as regards the Sacrificer; and the Adhvaryu is guiltless; on the slaughterer that guilt lies. Thrice he asks, for threefold is the sacrifice. And as to his saying, ‘That is of the gods,’ that which is cooked, indeed, belongs to the gods; therefore he says, ‘That is of the gods.’

<span id="v3_8_3_88"><sup><small>3:8:3:88.</small></sup></span>  The heart he bastes (with clotted ghee) first of all; for the heart is the self (soul), the mind; and the clotted ghee is the breath; he thus puts the breath into its (the victim's) self, into its mind; and thus it verily becomes the living food of the gods, and immortal for the immortals.

<span id="v3_8_3_99"><sup><small>3:8:3:99.</small></sup></span>  He bastes it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 18), ‘May thy mind unite with the mind; thy breath with the breath!’ He utters no Svâhâ (‘hail’), for this is not an oblation. They remove the victim (from the cooking-fire) [^501].

<span id="v3_8_3_1010"><sup><small>3:8:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  'They take it along the back of the pit, and <span id="p202"><sup><small>[ p. 202 ]</small></sup></span> between the sacrificial stake and the (Âhavanîya) fire. The reason why, though it is cooked, they do not take it across the middle (of the altar), as they take other sacrificial dishes, is ‘lest they should bring the sacrifice in the middle in connection with that which is cut up by limbs and mangled.’ And why they do not take it outside (the altar) in front of the stake, is that they would thereby put it outside the sacrifice: therefore they take (the flesh) along between the stake and the fire. When they have put it down south (of the fire), the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> cuts off (the portions). There are Plaksha branches [^502] (Ficus Infectoria) by way of an upper barhis (covering of altar); thereon he cuts. The reason why there are Plaksha branches by way of an upper barhis is this.

<span id="v3_8_3_1111"><sup><small>3:8:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  For when the gods, at first, seized an animal to sacrifice), Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> first spat upon its head, thinking, ‘Surely, thus they will not touch it!’ for animals belong to Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>. That (spittle became) the brain in the head and the marrow in the neck-bone [^503]: hence that (substance) is like spittle, for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> spat it. Let him therefore not eat that, since it was spitten by Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>.

<span id="v3_8_3_1212"><sup><small>3:8:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  Its sacrificial essence flowed down and there a tree sprang up. The gods beheld it; wherefore it (was called) ‘prakhya’ (visible), for ‘plaksha,’ <span id="p203"><sup><small>[ p. 203 ]</small></sup></span> doubtless, is the same as ‘prakhya.’ With that same sacrificial essence he now completes it (the victim), and makes it whole: hence there are Plaksha branches as an upper covering.

<span id="v3_8_3_1313"><sup><small>3:8:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then makes an ‘underlayer’ of ghee both in the <i>g</i>uhû and the upabh<i>ri</i>t, and in the vasâhomahavanî [^504], and the samavattadhânî [^505]; and puts a piece of gold [^506] both in the <i>g</i>uhû and the upabh<i>ri</i>t.

<span id="v3_8_3_1414"><sup><small>3:8:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he addresses (the Hot<i>ri</i>) for the recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity [^507]. The reason why he addresses him for the recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity is this. All the deities draw nigh to the victim while it is immolated, thinking, ‘My name he will choose, my name he will choose!’ for the animal victim is sacrificial food for all deities. The minds (manas), then, of all those deities are, fixed upon (ota) that victim; those (minds of theirs) he thereby satisfies, and thus the minds of the gods have not drawn nigh in vain. For this reason he addresses him for the recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity. <span id="p204"><sup><small>[ p. 204 ]</small></sup></span> 3:8:3:1515\. He first makes a portion of the heart [^508]. The reason why he first makes a portion of the heart which is in the middle, is that the heart is the breath, since it is from there that this breath moves upward [^509]; and the animal is breath, for only so long does the animal (live) as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.

<span id="v3_8_3_1616"><sup><small>3:8:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  The heart, then, is the animal; thus he first makes a portion of its very self (or soul). And, accordingly, if any portion were omitted, he need not heed this, since it is of his entire animal victim that the first portion is made which is made of the heart. He therefore first makes a portion of the heart, that being in the middle. Thereupon according to the proper order.

<span id="v3_8_3_1717"><sup><small>3:8:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  Then of the tongue, for that stands out from its fore-part. Then of the breast, for that also (stands out) therefrom [^510]. Then of the simultaneously moving (left) fore-foot [^511]. Then of the flanks. Then of the liver. Then of the kidneys.

<span id="v3_8_3_1818"><sup><small>3:8:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  The hind-part he divides into three parts; the broad piece (he reserves) for the by-offerings [^512]; the middle one he cuts into the guhû after dividing it in two; the narrow piece (he reserves) for the <span id="p205"><sup><small>[ p. 205 ]</small></sup></span> tryaṅga [^513]. Then of the simultaneously moving (right) haunch [^514]. This much, then, he cuts into the <i>g</i>uhû.

<span id="v3_8_3_1919"><sup><small>3:8:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  Then into the upabh<i>ri</i>t, he makes a portion of the upper part of the fore-foot belonging to the tryaṅga (viz. the right one); of the (narrow piece of the) hind-part, after dividing it in two; and of the haunch belonging to the tryaṅga (viz. the left). Thereupon he puts two pieces of gold on (the flesh oblations in the spoons) and pours ghee thereon.

<span id="v3_8_3_2020"><sup><small>3:8:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  He then takes the oblation of gravy [^515] with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 18), ‘Thou art trembling,’ for quivering, as it were, is the broth: hence he says, ‘Thou art trembling;’—‘May Agni prepare [^516] thee!’ for the fire does indeed cook it: hence he says, ‘May Agni prepare thee!’—‘The waters have washed thee together,’ for the water indeed gathers together that (fat) juice from the limbs: hence he says, ‘The waters have washed thee together.’

<span id="v3_8_3_2121"><sup><small>3:8:3:2121.</small></sup></span>  ‘For the sweeping of the wind—thee!’ for verily yonder blower sweeps along the air, and for the air he takes it: hence he says, ‘For the sweeping of the wind (I take) thee.’

<span id="v3_8_3_2222"><sup><small>3:8:3:2222.</small></sup></span>  ‘For the speed of Pûshan,’—Pûshan's speed, forsooth, is yonder (wind) [^517], and for that he takes it: hence he says, ‘For the speed of Pûshan.’ <span id="p206"><sup><small>[ p. 206 ]</small></sup></span> 3:8:3:2323\. ‘From the hot vapour may totter—;’ the hot vapour, namely, is yonder (wind), and for that he takes it: hence he says, ‘From the hot vapour may totter—.’ Thereupon he bastes it twice with ghee above.

<span id="v3_8_3_2424"><sup><small>3:8:3:2424.</small></sup></span>  He then mixes it either with the crooked knife or with the chopping-knife [^518], with ‘—Confounded hatred [^519]!’ whereby he chases away from here those evil spirits, the Rakshas.

<span id="v3_8_3_2525"><sup><small>3:8:3:2525.</small></sup></span>  The broth which is left he pours into the Samavattadhânî, and therein he throws the heart, tongue, breast, the broad piece (of the back part), the kidneys, and the rectum. He then bastes it twice with ghee above.

<span id="v3_8_3_2626"><sup><small>3:8:3:2626.</small></sup></span>  The reason why there is a piece of gold on each side is this. When they offer up the victim in the fire, they slay it, and gold means immortal life: thereby then it rests in immortal life; and so it rises from hence, and so it lives. This is why there is a piece of gold on each side.

<span id="v3_8_3_2727"><sup><small>3:8:3:2727.</small></sup></span>  And because he cuts crossways,—of the left fore-foot and the right haunch; and of the right forefoot and the left haunch,—therefore this animal draws forward its feet crossways. But were he to cut straight on, this animal would draw forward its feet (of the same side) simultaneously: therefore he cuts crossways. Then as to why he does not make cuttings of the head, nor the shoulders, nor the neck, nor the hind-thighs. <span id="p207"><sup><small>[ p. 207 ]</small></sup></span> 3:8:3:2828\. Now the Asuras, in the beginning, seized a victim. The gods, from fear, did not go near it [^520]. The Earth [^521] then said unto them, ‘Heed ye not this: I will myself be an eye-witness thereof, in whatsoever manner they will perform this (offering).’

<span id="v3_8_3_2929"><sup><small>3:8:3:2929.</small></sup></span>  She said, ‘Only one oblation have they offered, the other they have left over.’ Now that which they left over are these same portions. Thereupon the gods made over three limbs to (Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, whence the Tryaṅga oblations. The Asuras then made portions of the head, the shoulders, the neck, and the hind-thighs: therefore let him not make portions of these. And since Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> spat upon the neck, therefore let him not make a portion of the neck. Thereupon he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma for the havis of the buck!’ Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite the offering-prayer [^522] for) the havis of the buck to Agni and Soma!’ He does not say ‘(the havis) made ready:’ when the Soma has been pressed he says ‘made ready.’

<span id="v3_8_3_3030"><sup><small>3:8:3:3030.</small></sup></span>  In the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer he offers the oblation of gravy. It is from out of this that that essence (juice) has risen upwards here,—that sap of this earth whereby creatures exist on this side of the sky [^523]; for the <span id="p208"><sup><small>[ p. 208 ]</small></sup></span> oblation of gravy is sap, and essence is sap: thus he renders the sap strong by means of sap, whence this sap when eaten does not perish.

<span id="v3_8_3_3131"><sup><small>3:8:3:3131.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he offers the oblation of gravy in the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer,—one half-verse, forsooth, is this earth, and the other half-verse is yonder sky. Now between the sky and the earth is the air, and it is to the air that he offers: therefore he offers the oblation of gravy between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer.

<span id="v3_8_3_3232"><sup><small>3:8:3:3232.</small></sup></span>  He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 19), ‘Drink the ghee, ye drinkers of ghee! Drink the gravy, ye drinkers of gravy! thou art the havis of the air, Hail!’ With this prayer to the All-gods he offers, for the air belongs to the All-gods: because creatures move about here in the air breathing in and breathing out therewith, therefore it belongs to the All-gods. As the Vasha<i>t</i> (of the offering-prayer for the meat portions) is pronounced, he offers the portions that are in the <i>g</i>uhû.

<span id="v3_8_3_3333"><sup><small>3:8:3:3333.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon, while taking clotted ghee with the <i>g</i>uhû, he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the Lord of the forest!’ Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite the offering-prayer) to the lord of the forest!’ and offers, as the Vasha<i>t</i> is pronounced [^524]. The reason why he offers to the lord of the forest (the tree) is,—he thereby makes that thunderbolt, the sacrificial stake, a sharer (in the sacrifice); and, the lord of the forest being Soma [^525], <span id="p209"><sup><small>[ p. 209 ]</small></sup></span> he thereby makes the victim to be Soma. And as to his offering (to the tree) between the two oblations, he thus fills both completely: therefore he offers between the two oblations.

<span id="v3_8_3_3434"><sup><small>3:8:3:3434.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon, while pouring together the meat portions that are for the upabh<i>ri</i>t, he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (the maker of good offering)!’ Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘Prompt for Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is pronounced.

<span id="v3_8_3_3535"><sup><small>3:8:3:3535.</small></sup></span>  With what is left of the offering of gravy, he then sprinkles the quarters, with, ‘The regions,—the fore-regions,—the by-regions,—the intermediate regions,—the upper regions,—to the regions, Hail!’ For the offering of gravy is sap: thus he imbues all the regions with sap, and hence sap is obtained here on earth in every region.

<span id="v3_8_3_3636"><sup><small>3:8:3:3636.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he touches (what remains of) the victim [^526]: now is the time for the touching. And whether he has touched it before, fearing ‘those (evil spirits) that hover near will tear it about,’ or whether he be not afraid [^527] of its being torn about, let him in any case now touch (the victim). <span id="p210"><sup><small>[ p. 210 ]</small></sup></span> 3:8:3:3737\. \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 20\], ‘To Indra belongeth the out-breathing: may it attend [^528] to every limb! To Indra belongeth the in-breathing: it is attended to in every limb.’ Where it has been cut up limb by limb, there he heals it by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing.—‘O divine Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, let thine ample (forms) closely unite together, that it be uniform what is of different shape:’ whereby he makes it completely enclosed (in its limbs and flesh). ‘May thy friends, thy father and mother [^529], to please thee, joyfully welcome thee going to the gods!’ Thus, having made it whole wherever he has offered (a piece of) it, he afterwards unites it firmly, and that body (self) of it is complete in yonder world.


<span id="v3_8_4"><sup><small>3:8:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_8_4_11"><sup><small>3:8:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Now there are three elevens at the animal offering,—eleven fore-offerings, eleven after-offerings, and eleven by-offerings: ten fingers, ten toes, ten vital airs, and the out-breathing, in-breathing and through-breathing—this much constitutes man, who is the highest of animals, after whom [^530] are all animals. <span id="p211"><sup><small>[ p. 211 ]</small></sup></span> 3:8:4:22\. Now they say,‘ What, then, is done at the sacrifice whereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs?’

<span id="v3_8_4_33"><sup><small>3:8:4:33.</small></sup></span>  When he divides the hind-part into three portions,—the hind-part being (an opening of the) vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it all through.

<span id="v3_8_4_44"><sup><small>3:8:4:44.</small></sup></span>  And in that he cuts the hind-part into three portions,—one third for the by-offerings, one third into the <i>g</i>uhû, and one third into the upabh<i>ri</i>t,—thereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs.

<span id="v3_8_4_55"><sup><small>3:8:4:55.</small></sup></span>  He alone, however, may slay an animal who can supply it with the sacrificial essence [^531]. And if it be lean, let him stuff into the hind-part whatever may be left of the fat of the belly: the hind-part being (an opening of) the vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it all through. The animal, forsooth, is breath; for only so long (does) the animal (live), as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.

<span id="v3_8_4_66"><sup><small>3:8:4:66.</small></sup></span>  The hind-part is (part of) the animal, and fat means sacrificial essence [^532]: thus he supplies it with the sacrificial essence. But if it be tender (juicy), then it has itself obtained the sacrificial essence.

<span id="v3_8_4_77"><sup><small>3:8:4:77.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he takes clotted ghee; for twofold indeed is this (clotted ghee),—to wit, both ghee <span id="p212"><sup><small>[ p. 212 ]</small></sup></span> and sour milk [^533],—and a productive union means a couple: thus a productive union is thereby effected.

<span id="v3_8_4_88"><sup><small>3:8:4:88.</small></sup></span>  Therewith they perform at the after-offerings. The after-offerings mean cattle, and clotted ghee means milk: hence he thereby puts milk into the cattle, and thus milk is here contained (or beneficial, Nita) in the cattle; for clotted ghee means breath, because clotted ghee is food, and breath is food.

<span id="v3_8_4_99"><sup><small>3:8:4:99.</small></sup></span>  Therewith he (the Adhvaryu) performs in front (on the Âhavanîya) at the after-offerings,—-whereby he puts into (the victim) that vital air which is here in front;—and therewith he (the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>) performs behind (the altar) at the by-offerings [^534],—whereby he puts into it that vital air which is here behind: thus two vital airs are here contained (or beneficial) on both sides, the one above and the one below.

<span id="v3_8_4_1010"><sup><small>3:8:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  Here now, one (Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces the Vasha<i>t</i> for two,—for the Adhvaryu (who performs the after-offerings) <span id="p213"><sup><small>[ p. 213 ]</small></sup></span> and for him (the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>) who performs the by-offerings. And because he offers them by (in addition to) the offering (Adhvaryu), therefore they are called by-offerings. And in performing the by-offerings, he produces (offspring) [^535], since he performs the by-offerings behind (the altar), and from behind offspring is produced from woman.

<span id="v3_8_4_1111"><sup><small>3:8:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  He offers the by-offerings with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 21), ‘Go thou to the sea, Hail!’ The sea is water, and seed is water: he thereby casts seed.

<span id="v3_8_4_1212"><sup><small>3:8:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘Go thou to the air, Hail!’ It is into (along) the air that offspring is born: into the air he produces (offspring).

<span id="v3_8_4_1313"><sup><small>3:8:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  ‘Go thou to the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, Hail!’ Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> he thus produces creatures.

<span id="v3_8_4_1414"><sup><small>3:8:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  ‘Go thou to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, Hail!’ Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus bestows out-breathing and in-breathing on the creatures.

15\. 'Go thou to the day and the night, Hail! It is through (along) day and night that offspring is born: through day and night he causes creatures to be born.

<span id="v3_8_4_1616"><sup><small>3:8:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  ‘Go thou to the metres, Hail!’ There are seven metres; and there are seven domestic and seven wild animals: both kinds he thus causes to be produced.

<span id="v3_8_4_1717"><sup><small>3:8:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  ‘Go thou to heaven and earth, Hail!’ For, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having created the living beings, <span id="p214"><sup><small>[ p. 214 ]</small></sup></span> enclosed them between heaven and earth, and so these beings are enclosed between heaven and earth. And in like manner does this (offerer), having created living beings, enclose them between heaven and earth.

<span id="v3_8_4_1818"><sup><small>3:8:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  He then makes additional by-offerings (atiupaya<i>g</i>). Were he not to make additional by-offerings, there would only be as many living beings as were created in the beginning; they would not be propagated; but by making additional by-offerings he indeed propagates them; whence creatures are again born here repeatedly [^536].


<span id="v3_8_5"><sup><small>3:8:5</small></sup></span>

## FIFTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_8_5_11"><sup><small>3:8:5:11.</small></sup></span>  He makes the additional by-offerings:—with ‘Go thou to the sacrifice [^537], Hail!’ The sacrifice is water, and seed is water: he thus casts seed.

<span id="v3_8_5_22"><sup><small>3:8:5:22.</small></sup></span>  ‘Go thou to Soma, Hail!’ Soma is seed: he thus casts seed.

<span id="v3_8_5_33"><sup><small>3:8:5:33.</small></sup></span>  ‘Go thou to the heavenly ether, Hail!’ The heavenly ether is water, and seed is water: he thus casts seed.

<span id="v3_8_5_44"><sup><small>3:8:5:44.</small></sup></span>  ‘Go thou to Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, Hail!’ Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara (‘belonging to all men’) is this earth, and she is a safe resting-place: upon that safe resting-place he thus produces (creatures).

<span id="v3_8_5_55"><sup><small>3:8:5:55.</small></sup></span>  He then touches his mouth, with, ‘Give me mind and heart!’ thus indeed the by-offerer does not throw himself after (the oblations into the fire).

<span id="v3_8_5_66"><sup><small>3:8:5:66.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon [^538] they perform the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as <span id="p215"><sup><small>[ p. 215 ]</small></sup></span> with the tail (of the victim), for the tail is the hind-part, and from the hind-part of woman offspring is produced: hence offspring is produced by the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as being performed with the tail.

<span id="v3_8_5_77"><sup><small>3:8:5:77.</small></sup></span>  For the wives of the gods he cuts portions from the inside, since it is from the inside of woman that offspring is produced; for Agni the householder from above, since it is from above that the male approaches the female.

<span id="v3_8_5_88"><sup><small>3:8:5:88.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon they betake themselves, with the heart-spit, to the purificatory bath [^539]. Now, the anguish of the victim, in being slaughtered, concentrates itself into the heart, and from the heart into the heart-spit; and whatever part of cooked (food) is pierced that becomes palatable [^540]: therefore let him roast it on the spit after piercing it. Uppermost on the thrice-moved (portions of the) victim he places that heart after pulling it off (the spit).

9\. He (the slaughterer) then hands the heart-spit (to the Adhvaryu). Let him not throw it on the <span id="p216"><sup><small>[ p. 216 ]</small></sup></span> ground, nor into the water; for were he to throw it on the ground, that anguish would enter into the plants and trees; and were he to throw it into the water, that anguish would enter into the water: hence neither on the ground, nor into the water.

<span id="v3_8_5_1010"><sup><small>3:8:5:1010.</small></sup></span>  But on going down to the water, let him bury it at the place where the dry and the moist meet. But if he feel disinclined to going down (to the water), he pours out a vessel of water in front of the sacrificial stake and buries (the spit) at the place where the dry and the moist meet, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 22), ‘Injure thou not the waters nor the plants!’ thus it injures neither the waters nor the plants; ‘From every fetter [^541]\—therefrom deliver us, O king Varu<i>n</i>a! That they say, we swear by the “Inviolable (cows),” by “Varu<i>n</i>a [^542],” <span id="p217"><sup><small>[ p. 217 ]</small></sup></span> therefrom deliver us, O Varu<i>n</i>a!’ Thereby he delivers him [^543] from every noose of Varu<i>n</i>a, from all (guilt) against Varu<i>n</i>a.

<span id="v3_8_5_1111"><sup><small>3:8:5:1111.</small></sup></span>  He then addresses (the water) [^544] with, ‘May the waters and plants be friendly unto us, unfriendly to him who hateth us, and whom we hate!’ For when they proceed with that (spit), the waters, forsooth, as well as the plants, keep as it were receding from him; but hereby he now makes a covenant with them, and so they again approach to him, and that expiation is performed (to them). He does not perform (the spit-bath) at the animal offering to Agni and Soma, nor at that to Agni, but only at that of the Anûbandhyâ-cow [^545], for therewith the whole sacrifice attains to completion. And in that they perform (the ceremony) with the heart-spit at the cow (offering), thereby indeed it comes to be performed also for the animal offering to Agni and Soma, as well as for that to Agni.

## Footnotes

[^466]: 184:2 Viz. at the north-west corner (or left hip) of the altar. For the formulas used by him, see I, 5, 1, 24-2, 1.

[^467]: 185:1 The text has only ‘âpyâyayanti,’ but the verb with which the author connects the verb ‘âprî’ is either â-p<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âti, he fills; or (more correctly) ‘â-prî<i>n</i>âti,’ he gratifies, propitiates, corresponding to the Zand âfrînaiti. Perhaps some words have been lost here. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has: sa yad etâbhir âprîbhi<i>h</i> punar âpyâyata etâbhir enam âpri<i>n</i>âti tasmâd âpriyo nâma. On the Âprî verses, which form the offering-prayers (yâ<i>g</i>yâs) at the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice, and vary according to different families, see Ait. Br. II, 4; Max Müller, Hist. of A. S. L., p. 463 seq.; Haug, Essays, p. 24r.

[^468]: 185:2 See I, 5, 3, 8. The Adhvaryu calls out to the Agnîdh, ‘O <i>s</i>râvaya (make listen)!’ The Agnîdh calls out, ‘Astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i> (yea, may one hear)!’ The Adhvaryu calls on the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a, ‘Preshya samidha<i>h</i> (prompt as to the kindling-sticks)!’ \[or, ‘Preshya Tanûnapâtam or Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sam’ &c. in the succeeding fore-offerings.\] The Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a calls out, ‘Hotâ yakshat samidham \[Tanûnapâtam, &c.\], (let the Hot<i>ri</i> pronounce the offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks, &c,!)’ Each offering-prayer (Âprî) is introduced p. 186 with the formula ‘Ye ya<i>g</i>âmahe, &c.’ See part i, p.148 note. The divine objects of these oblations of ghee are: 1. the Samidhs or kindling-sticks; 2. either Tanûnapât or Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa; 3. the I<i>d</i>as; 4. the Barhis (sacrificial grass on the altar); 5. the gates (of heaven and worshipping ground); 6. Dawn and Night; 7. the two divine Hot<i>ri</i>s; 8. the three goddesses (Sarasvatî, I<i>d</i>â, and Bhâratî); 9. Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>; 10. Vanaspati (the tree, or lord of the forest); 11. the Svâhâk<i>ri</i>tis (calls of ‘All-hail,’ which at this, the last offering-prayer, are repeated before the names of the principal deities of the sacrifice). For this last fore-offering, see [III, 8, 2, 23](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_2_23) seq.

[^469]: 186:1 See I, 5, 3, 16.

[^470]: 186:2 For the three parts of the thunderbolt, see [p. 108](Book_2_3_4#p108), note [2](Book_2_3_4#fn285).

[^471]: 186:3 The Hot<i>ri</i> recites the triplet, Rig-veda IV, 15, 1-3.

[^472]: 187:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to take ‘abhipariharati’ in the sense of ‘he takes it round to the place where they cook.’ According to Kâty. VI, 5, 2, 3, the Agnîdh circumambulates thrice from left to right, either the place comprising the victim, the ghee, the slaughtering-place, the sacrificial post, the <i>k</i>âtvâla, and Âhavanîya; or only the ghee, the victim, and slaughtering-place. He then throws the firebrand back on the Âhavanîya, and performs the circumambulation as many times in the opposite direction. On the Paryagnikara<i>n</i>a, see also part i, p. 45 note.

[^473]: 188:1 For the two omentum-spits, see note on [III, 8, 2, 16](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_2_16).

[^474]: 188:2 The Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's additional cue or order (upapraisha) is ‘Agni has been victorious; he has won wealth!’ On the Hot<i>ri</i>'s recitation—the so-called Adhrigu litany—commencing ‘Ye divine quieters (slaughterers), commence, as well as ye that are human!’ and consisting of formulas usually pronounced by the Adhvaryu (and hence perhaps going back to a time when the Hot<i>ri</i> had to perform all but the menial parts of the sacrificial service), see Ait. Br. II, 6-7; Roth, Yâska XXXVII seq.

[^475]: 189:1 According to Kâty. VI, 5, 15, the stalk is put down behind the <i>S</i>âmitra (i.e. the fire at the slaughtering-place) with the top towards the east.

[^476]: 189:2 Lit. ‘by means of the frontal bone.’ Sâya<i>n</i>a explains it by ‘in p. 190 seizing it by the horn;’ Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 222, ‘by striking it with a horn.’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, tasya na kû<i>t</i>ena praghnanti mânusha<i>m</i> ha kuryâd yad asya kû<i>t</i>ena prahanyu<i>h</i>.

[^477]: 190:1 That is, surrounding, relating to, the victim.

[^478]: 192:1 Or, perhaps, she and the sacrificer, as Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it (ya<i>g</i>amâna<i>h</i> patnî <i>k</i>a). Kâty. VI, 6, 4 leaves it doubtful; but the commentator interprets the rule as referring to the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer, in accordance with the reading of the Kâ<i>n</i>va text—‘atha yâ<i>h</i> pari<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>â âpo bhavanti tâbhir adhvaryu<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a ya<i>g</i>amâna<i>s</i> <i>k</i>ânushi<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ata<i>h</i>.’

[^479]: 192:2 Âsthâpayanti = sa<i>m</i><i>g</i><i>ñ</i>apayanti, Sâya<i>n</i>a.

[^480]: 193:1 Ned idam anv ahorâtrâ<i>n</i>i <i>s</i>o<i>k</i>ân iti, Kâ<i>n</i>va recension.

[^481]: 193:2 See [III, 8, 1, 5](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_1_5).

[^482]: 194:1 The two vapâ<i>s</i>rapa<i>n</i>îs (omentum-roasters) consist of sticks of kârshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea), one of them being quite straight, while the other is bifurcate at the top, thus resembling a prop.

[^483]: 194:2 Or, its flesh-juice, medha. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads throughout medhas.

[^484]: 194:3 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has the preferable reading,—Sa yat k<i>ri</i>shyamâ<i>n</i>ât samabhavat tasmât kârshmaryo nâma, ‘and because it sprang from that drawn-up (victim), therefore it is called kârshmarya.’

[^485]: 195:1 \[He does so, thinking\], ‘Lest I should cook it on the Âhavanîya uncooked.’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^486]: 195:2 ‘For it is for the drops that he thus lights it.’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^487]: 195:3 That is, across the altar immediately behind the fire or high altar.

[^488]: 196:1 Thus according to the commentator on Kâty. VI, 6, 18. See also note on [IV, 2, 5, 22](Book_2_4_2#v4_2_5_22), and Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 101 note.

[^489]: 196:2 The (invitatory) formulas are Rig-Veda I, 75, 1, and III, 21, 1-5; Ait. Br. II, 12; Â<i>s</i>v. Sr. III, 4, 1.

[^490]: 196:3 The Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> withdraws the omentum from the fire, and takes it (between fire and stake) to the north of the pit, where the Adhvaryu in the first place performs the so-called prâ<i>n</i>adâna (vol. i, p. 438 note), after which he deposits it on the altar. Kâty. VI, 6, 20.

[^491]: 196:4 That is, for the offering-prayer or yâ<i>g</i>yâ of the last fore-offering, being the last verse of whatever âprî hymn may be used; followed by a number of Svâhâs, each with the name of some deity or deities (cf. I, 8, 3, 22-23).

[^492]: 196:5 Cf. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 100, note 4.

[^493]: 197:1 That is, so much time has gone by since I first adopted that practice, and here I am grown old and still in full vigour, Sây. 'But he, lying old and worn out, said, “These two arms have become gray—what in the world has become of the Brahman's word!”' Kâ<i>n</i>va text.

[^494]: 197:2 On the two butter-portions to Agni and Soma, succeeding the fore-offerings, see part i, p. 174 note.

[^495]: 198:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has ‘hira<i>n</i>ya<i>s</i>alká (masc.)’ here and elsewhere.

[^496]: 198:2 The anuvâkyâ and yâ<i>g</i>yâ for the omentum are Rig-veda I, 93, 1 and 5 respectively.

[^497]: 198:3 At the animal offerings on the Soma-days he adds to his praisha (order) the word ‘prasthitam,’ lit. standing before (the altar). Kâty. VI, 6, 27. See also <i>S</i>. Br. IV, 4, 3, 9.

[^498]: 198:4 Ûrdhvanabhas, ‘he who drives the clouds upwards’ (or, keeps the clouds above), or, perhaps, ‘he who is above (in) the welkin,’ is apparently a name of Vâyu, the wind. Cf. [III, 6, 1, 16](Book_2_3_6#v3_6_1_16).

[^499]: 199:1 They do so with the mantra, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 17 (Atharva-veda VII, 89, 3; cf. Rig-veda I, 23, 22; X, 9, 8).

[^500]: 199:2 The technical name of this cake to Indra and Agni is pa<i>s</i>u-purodâ<i>s</i>a (animal-cake). The anuvâkyâ and yâ<i>g</i>yâ for the chief oblation, are Rig-veda I, 93, 2 and 6 respectively; for the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, III, I, 23, and III, 54, 22; Adv. III, 8, 1; 5, 9. For a similar performance, described in detail, see note on III, 2, 5, 22.

[^501]: 199:3 On the sacrificial essence passing successively from man into the horse, the ox, the goat, and finally into the rice and barley, see I, 2, 3, 6-7.

[^502]: 200:1 The order of proceeding is not quite clear from the context, and seems to have puzzled the later ritualists. From Kâty. VI, 7-8 it would seem that the author of the Sûtras means the performance of the cake-offering to go on simultaneously with the cutting up of the victim (and the cooking of the portions and roasting of the beast). The comm. on Kâty. VI, 7, 29, however, protests against this arrangement as contrary to the order laid down in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a; and insists especially on the ‘atha (now)’ at the beginning of this paragraph. This particle is, however, often used in a vague sense; as very frequently when, after sketching the chief course of performance, the author turns back to fill in the details. There seems also a difference of opinion as to the exact meaning of the above direction given by the Adhvaryu to the Samitar after (as would seem) the portions have been cooked. The commentator on Kâty. VI, 8, 1 apparently takes ‘tri<i>h</i> pra<i>k</i>yâvaya’ in the sense of ‘shake thrice’ or ‘turn thrice.’ Sâya<i>n</i>a, on the other hand, explains it as meaning that the <i>S</i>amit<i>ri</i> is to divide the portions into three parts, according to whether they are destined for the chief offerings, or the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, or the by-offerings (?). As the direction cannot refer to the taking out of the portions from the cooking-vessel (ukhâ) it would seem that the <i>S</i>amitar is either to move (shake) the vessel itself, or to stir the contents, perhaps hereby separating the respective portions. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, Tri<i>h</i> pra<i>k</i>yâvayâd ity uttame pra<i>k</i>yâva uttamârdhe h<i>ri</i>daya<i>m</i> kurutâd iti. The heart, when done, is to be removed from the spit and laid on the portions; whereupon the Adhvaryu pours ghee on the portions ([paragraph 8](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_3_8)).

[^503]: 201:1 The Adhvaryu removes the dish northwards from the fire, takes the portions out of it, puts them into some kind of basket, and performs ‘prâ<i>n</i>adâna’ ([p. 196](Book_2_3_8#p196), note [3](Book_2_3_8#fn488)) on them.

[^504]: 202:1 Or, the Plaksha branches with which the altar was covered on the preceding night. See [p. 120](Book_2_3_5#p120), note [3](Book_2_3_5#fn320). The Kâ<i>n</i>va text (as Taitt. S. VI, 3, 10, 2) speaks of one Plaksha branch put on the barhis.

[^505]: 202:2 Anûka, of which anûkya is the adjective, means ‘the forepart of the spinal column.’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads,—yan mastishko yad anûke ma<i>g</i><i>g</i>â.

[^506]: 203:1 That is, the ladle used (as a substitute for the <i>g</i>uhû) for offering the fat-liquor or gravy. See [paragraph 20](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_3_20).

[^507]: 203:2 That is, the vessel used for holding the cuttings (samavatta) of the i<i>d</i>â; also called i<i>d</i>âpâtrî, see part i, p. 219, note 3.

[^508]: 203:3 See [p. 198](Book_2_3_8#p198), note [1](Book_2_3_8#fn493).

[^509]: 203:4 Thereupon he says, ‘Recite to the manotâ (deity) the invitatory prayer for (of) the havis which is being cut in portions (havisho ’vadîyamânasya).’ Kâ<i>n</i>va text; cf. Ait. Br. II, 10.—While the sacrificial portions are being cut into the respective spoons, the Hot<i>ri</i> recites the Hymn to Agni, Rig-veda VI, 1, 1-13, beginning, ‘Thou, O wondrous Agni, the first thinker (manot<i>ri</i>) of this hymn, wert verily the priest. . . .’ From the occurrence of this word manotâ, the latter has come to be the technical name both of the hymn itself and of the deity (Agni) to whom it is recited.

[^510]: 204:1 Literally, he makes a cutting of the heart (h<i>ri</i>dayasya-avadyati), that is to say, he puts the entire heart into the <i>g</i>uhû as an offering-portion.

[^511]: 204:2 Etasmâd dhy ayam ûrdhva<i>h</i> prâ<i>n</i>a u<i>k</i><i>k</i>arati, Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^512]: 204:3 Or, that (comes) after that (tongue): tad dhi tato ’nvak, Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^513]: 204:4 According to Kâty. VI, 7, 6, it is the foremost (or upper) joint (pûrvana<i>d</i>aka) of the left fore-foot which is taken. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has simply ‘atha dosh<i>n</i>a<i>h</i>.’

[^514]: 204:5 See [III, 8, 4, 9](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_4_9) seq.

[^515]: 205:1 Literally, the three-limbs, the technical name of the portion for Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t.

[^516]: 205:2 For ‘athaika<i>k</i>arâyai <i>s</i>ro<i>n</i>e<i>h</i>’ the Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads ‘áthấdhyûdhasa<i>h</i> <i>s</i>ró<i>n</i>e<i>h</i>,’ of the hip above the udder.

[^517]: 205:3 Vasâ, i.e. the melted fat (and juice) mixed with the water in which the portions have been cooked, and forming a rich gravy, offered with the Vasâhomahavanî.

[^518]: 205:4 Literally, ‘mix’—<i>s</i>rî, this root being here, as usual, confounded with <i>s</i><i>ri</i>, to cook.

[^519]: 205:5 Esha viva pûshâ yo ’yam pavata etasmâ u hi g_ri<i>h</i>n_âti, Kâ<i>n</i>va recension.

[^520]: 206:1 <i>S</i>âsena vâ pâr<i>s</i>vena vâ, Kâ<i>n</i>va text.

[^521]: 206:2 This forms part of the preceding formula (as subject to the verb ‘may totter’), though the author seems to separate it therefrom, as does Mahîdhara. The meaning of the formula seems to be, ‘May the enemies perish, confounded by (?) the hot vapour!’

[^522]: 207:1 The St. Petersburg Dict. takes ‘Na-upâveyu<i>h</i>’ in the sense of ‘they did not fall in therewith; they did not feel inclined for it;’ as above, [III, 7, 3, 3](Book_2_3_7#v3_7_3_3). Sâya<i>n</i>a explains it by ‘nopâgatâ<i>h</i>’ (MSS. nâpâgatâ<i>h</i>).

[^523]: 207:2 That is, Aditi, according to the Kâ<i>n</i>va recension.

[^524]: 207:3 The yâ<i>g</i>yâ and anuvâkyâ are I, 93, 3 and 7 respectively.

[^525]: 207:4 Ito vâ ayam ûrdhva u<i>k</i><i>kh</i><i>ri</i>to raso yam idam imâ<i>h</i> pra<i>g</i>â upa<i>g</i>îvanty arvâg divo ’sminn antarikshe, Kâ<i>n</i>va recension.

[^526]: 208:1 For the formulas used with this oblation, as well as the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. pp. 95-96 notes.

[^527]: 208:2 Or, Soma being a tree (plant).

[^528]: 209:1 This touching takes place either before or after the invocation of I<i>d</i>â (see I, 8, I, I seq.), whereupon the priests and sacrificer eat their respective portions; the straight gut being the Agnîdh's, the part above the udder (adhyndhnî) the Hot<i>ri</i>'s, the kloman (apparently the right lung) the Brahman's, the pericardium (? purîtat) the Adhvaryu's, and the spleen the sacrificer's share, while the I<i>d</i>â is eaten by all of them.

[^529]: 209:2 Or perhaps,—And as to his touching it before this, (he did so) fearing lest those (evil spirits) that hover near would tear it about; and even if he be not (any longer?) afraid of its being torn about, let him now touch it in any case. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has simply,—p. 210 This is the time for touching; but if he think, ‘Those standing about here will meddle with it,’ he may also touch it before: but this is certainly the time for touching.

[^530]: 210:1 The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that ‘nidîdhyat’ and ‘nidhîta’ are probably corruptions of forms from ‘dhâ;’ the Taitt. S. (I, 3, 10) having ‘ni dedhyat—vi bobhuvat’ instead. Mahîdhara also takes ‘nidîdhyat’ from ‘dhî’ in the sense of ‘dhâ,’—'Indra's out-breathing is infused into every limb; Indra's in-breathing has been infused into every limb.‘ The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has ’-nidhîta<i>h</i>, -nidîdhe.’

[^531]: 210:2 Rather, ‘the mothers (or mother) and fathers.’ The Taitt. S. separates mâtâ pitara<i>h</i>, ‘the mother and the fathers.’

[^532]: 210:3 That is, inferior to whom, or, after the manner of whom.

[^533]: 211:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a takes ‘medham’ as apposition to ‘enam,’ and explains it by ‘medhârha, prav<i>ri</i>ddha,’ and ‘upanayet’ by ‘prâpnuyât’ (it is, doubtless, ‘zuführen’). The Kâ<i>n</i>va text, however, reads,—Tad âhu<i>h</i> sa vai pa<i>s</i>u<i>m</i> labheteti ya ena<i>m</i> medha upanayed iti.

[^534]: 211:2 Gudo vai pa<i>s</i>u<i>h</i>, medo vai medhas; this is one of many exceptions to the rule laid down by Professor Delbrück regarding the order of subject and predicate, Synt. Forsch., III, p. 26. Copulative sentences with a tertium comparationis likewise do not generally conform to that rule.

[^535]: 212:1 See [p. 156](Book_2_3_6#p156), note [3](Book_2_3_6#fn414).

[^536]: 212:2 When the priests and sacrificer have eaten their portions of the I<i>d</i>â, the Agnîdh fetches hot coals from the <i>S</i>âmitra (or, at the animal offering connected with the Soma-sacrifice), optionally from the Âgnîdhra, and puts them on the Hot<i>ri</i>'s hearth ([p. 148](Book_2_3_6#p148), note [4](Book_2_3_6#fn392)),—or at the ordinary animal offering (nirû<i>dh</i>a pa<i>s</i>u), on the north hip (north-west corner) of the altar after removing the sacrificial grass. On these coals the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> performs the by-offerings (upaya<i>g</i>), while the Adhvaryu performs the after-offerings (anuyâ<i>g</i>a) on the Âhavanîya. For the by-offerings the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> cuts the respective part and the hind-quarter ([III, 8, 3, 18](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_3_18)) into eleven parts, and at each Vasha<i>t</i> throws one piece thereof with his hand into the fire. The recipients of the first eight and the last after-offerings, on the other hand, are the same as those of the nine after-offerings at the Seasonal sacrifices (part i, p. 404). The Hot<i>ri</i>'s formulas for the additional two offerings, inserted before the last, are: 9. The divine lord of the forest \[10. The divine barhis of water-plants\] may graciously accept (the offering) for abundant obtainment of abundant gift! Vausha<i>t</i>!' (cf. part i, p. 235; Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. III, 6, 13.)

[^537]: 213:1 Praivaina<i>m</i> ta<i>g</i> <i>g</i>anayati, ‘he causes it (the victim) to be born (again).’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec. The above passage has apparently to be understood in a general sense, ‘he causes birth to take place among living creatures.’

[^538]: 214:1 Or, ‘by making additional by-offerings he reproduces them: whence creatures are born here returning again and again’ (metempsychosis).

[^539]: 214:2 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text (as the Taitt. S.) reverses the order of this and the following formula. Nor does it begin a new Brâhma<i>n</i>a here.

[^540]: 214:3 Having completed the last after-offering, the Adhvaryu, in the p. 215 first place, throws the first chip of the sacrificial stake into the fire, in accordance with [III, 7, 1, 32](Book_2_3_7#v3_7_1_32). For the four Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as, the deities of which are Soma, Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, the wives of the gods, and Agni the householder, see part i, p. 256, The first two offerings may consist only of ghee, or, as the last two, of a piece of the tail.

[^541]: 215:1 The technical term for this purificatory ceremony is <i>s</i>ûlâvabh<i>ri</i>tha, or spit-bath.' On the present occasion it is not performed (see [paragraph 11](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_5_11)), but it is inserted here because it forms the conclusion of the ordinary animal offering, not connected with the Soma-sacrifice (nirû<i>dh</i>a-pa<i>s</i>u), as well as of the offering of a sterile cow (termed anûbandhyâ) to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, which concludes the Soma-sacrifice. See part i, p. 379, note 1, and [IV, 5, 2, 1](Book_2_4_5#v4_5_2_1) seq.

[^542]: 215:2 ? Ala<i>m</i><i>g</i>usha, ‘sufficient for eating,’ Sâya<i>n</i>a, ‘sufficient in itself,’ St. Petersburg Dict. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has the probably preferable reading,—atha ala<i>m</i>gusha<i>m</i> <i>s</i>ritam eva parit<i>ri</i>ndanti,—they then pierce (with the spit) what is already sufficiently cooked.

[^543]: 216:1 This is a doubtful rendering in accordance with the suggestion in the St. Petersburg Dict., that ‘dhâmno-dhâmna<i>h</i>’ in this passage is an old corruption of ‘dâmno-dâmna<i>h</i>.’ The Taitt. S. has the sane reading. Sâya<i>n</i>a and Mahîdhara take it in the sense of ‘from every place (infested by enemies, or, rendered fearful by thy noose) deliver us!’ Could ‘dhâmno-dhâmna<i>h</i>’ be taken as gen. to ‘râ<i>g</i>an?’

[^544]: 216:2 ? Or, ‘That they say (i.e. mention the word) “Cows,”—that we swear by “Varu<i>n</i>a,”—therefrom deliver us, O Varu<i>n</i>a!’ If the mentioning of words for cow (as well as the taking in vain of Varu<i>n</i>a's name) is meant to he censured in this passage, <i>S</i>at. Br. II, 2, 4, 14 (part i, p. 326 note) may be compared. It seems, however, doubtful whether the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a took the term aghnyâ<i>h</i> as referring to ‘cows’ here. The St. Petersburg Dict., s.v. <i>s</i>ap, translates, ‘when we swear by the name of Varu<i>n</i>a.’ Instead of ‘Yad âhur aghnyâ iti varu<i>n</i>eti <i>s</i>apâmahe,’ the Taitt. S (I, 3, 11, 1) reads ‘Yad âpo aghniyâ varu<i>n</i>eti <i>s</i>apâmahe,’ which Sâya<i>n</i>a explains by ‘O ye waters, O ye Aghnyâ<i>h</i> (? inviolable ones, cows, waters), O Varu<i>n</i>a! thus we solicit thee (to avert evil from us);’ adding a passage to the effect that he who approaches his better (addressing him) by name, wishes him ‘pu<i>n</i>yârti;’ while in the present mantra, he contends there is no mere ‘taking the name of Varu<i>n</i>a in vain.’

[^546]: 217:2 According to the Kâ<i>n</i>va text and Kâty. VI, 10, 5 they (the priests and sacrificer) touch the water while muttering the formula—‘From every fetter . . . . and whom we hate.’
