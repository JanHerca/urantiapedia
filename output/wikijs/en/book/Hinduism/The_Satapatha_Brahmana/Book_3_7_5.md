## FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v7_5_1_11"><sup><small>7:5:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He then puts down a (living) tortoise;—the tortoise means life-sap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that life-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the waters [^720]: that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni). As far as the life-sap extends, so far the body extends: that (tortoise) thus is these worlds.

<span id="v7_5_1_22"><sup><small>7:5:1:22.</small></sup></span>  That lower shell of it is this (terrestrial) world; it is, as it were, fixed; for fixed, as it were, is this (earth-)world. And that upper shell of it is yonder sky; it has its ends, as it were, bent down; for yonder sky has its ends, as it were, bent down. And what is between (the shells) is the air;—that (tortoise) thus is these worlds: it is these worlds he thus lays down (to form part of the altar).

<span id="v7_5_1_33"><sup><small>7:5:1:33.</small></sup></span>  He anoints it with sour curds, honey, and ghee,—sour curds doubtless are a form of this (earth-)world, <span id="p390"><sup><small>[ p. 390 ]</small></sup></span> ghee of the air, and honey of yonder sky: he thus supplies it (the tortoise) with its own form. Or, sour curds are the life-sap of this (earth-)world, ghee that of the air, and honey that of yonder sky: he thus supplies it with its own life-sap.

<span id="v7_5_1_44"><sup><small>7:5:1:44.</small></sup></span>  \[He anoints it, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 27-29; <i>Ri</i>k S. I, 90, 6-8\] ‘Honey the winds pour forth for the righteous, honey the rivers; full of honey may the plants be for us!—Honey by night and morn, rich in honey may the region of the earth be for us, honey the father Heaven!—rich in honey may the tree be for us, rich in honey the sun, full of honey the kine!’ To whatever deity a Rik-verse, and to whatever (deity) a Ya<i>g</i>us formula applies, that very deity the verse is, and that very deity the sacrificial formula is [^721]. This triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap he thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gâyatrî verses (he performs): the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_5_1_55"><sup><small>7:5:1:55.</small></sup></span>  And as to its being called ‘kûrma’ (tortoise);Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having assumed that form, created living beings. Now what he created, he made; and inasmuch as he made (kar), he is (called) ‘kûrma;’ and ‘kûrma’ being (the same as) ‘ka<i>s</i>yapa’ (a tortoise), therefore all creatures are said to be descended from Ka<i>s</i>yapa.

<span id="v7_5_1_66"><sup><small>7:5:1:66.</small></sup></span>  Now this tortoise is the same as yonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus lays down (on the altar). He lays it down in front with the head towards the back (west): he thus places yonder sun in the east <span id="p391"><sup><small>[ p. 391 ]</small></sup></span> looking thitherwards (or moving westward); and hence yonder sun is placed in the east looking thitherwards. On the right (south) of the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â (he places it), for the tortoise (kûrma, masc.) is a male, and the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female;—at a cubit's distance [^722], for at a cubit's distance the male lies by the female. That Ashâ<i>dh</i>â is the consecrated queen (mahishî) of all the bricks, hence being on the right (south) side of her, it (the tortoise) is on the right side of all the bricks.

<span id="v7_5_1_77"><sup><small>7:5:1:77.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts down a tortoise;—the tortoise (kûrma) is the breath, for the breath makes (kar) all these creatures: it is breath he thus puts into him (Agni). He puts it down in front looking towards the back: he thus puts in the breath in front tending towards the back; whence the breath is taken in from the front backwards. \[He puts it down so as to be\] turned towards the (gold) man: he thus puts breath into the Sacrificer. South of the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â (he puts it), for the tortoise is breath, and the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â speech; and the breath (prâ<i>n</i>a, masc.) is the male, the mate, of speech (vâ<i>k</i>, fem.).

<span id="v7_5_1_88"><sup><small>7:5:1:88.</small></sup></span>  \[He sets it down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 30-32\] Seat thee in the depth of the waters for that indeed is the deepest (place) of the (heavenly) waters where yonder (sun) burns;—‘lest the sun, lest Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara should scorch thee!’ that is, lest the Sun, lest Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara injure thee;—‘Overlook the creatures with unbroken wings,’ that is, overlook all these uninjured, unharmed creatures, that is, these bricks;—'may <span id="p392"><sup><small>[ p. 392 ]</small></sup></span> heaven's rain favour thee!' this he says in order that the rain of heaven may favour him.

<span id="v7_5_1_99"><sup><small>7:5:1:99.</small></sup></span>  He then makes it move [^723], with, ‘Over the heaven-reaching three oceans he crept,’ the three heaven-reaching oceans doubtless are these worlds, and over them he crept in the shape of a tortoise;—‘the lord of waters, the bull of the bricks,’ for he (the tortoise) indeed is the lord of waters, and the bull of the bricks;—‘induing the covering of him, the well-made, in the world,’ the covering (purîsha) means the cattle: thus, entering the (form of the) cattle of the well-made (Agni) in the world;—‘go thither whither the former have passed away!’ that is, go thither whither by this performance former (tortoises) went.

<span id="v7_5_1_1010"><sup><small>7:5:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  ‘The mighty sky and the earth,’ that is, the great sky and the earth;—‘shall mix (prepare) this our sacrifice!’ that is, shall favour this sacrifice;—‘they shall fill us with nourishments!’ that is, they shall nourish us with nourishments! With the last (verse) relating to heaven and earth he puts it down, for the tortoise represents heaven and earth.

<span id="v7_5_1_1111"><sup><small>7:5:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  With three (formulas) he puts it on (the altar);—three are these worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts it on. With three (formulas) he anoints it; that makes six: the significance of this (number) has been explained. There are avakâ-plants [^724] below and avakâ-plants above (the <span id="p393"><sup><small>[ p. 393 ]</small></sup></span> tortoise),—the avakâ-plant means water: he thus places it in the midst of water. Having ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_5_1_1212"><sup><small>7:5:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  He then puts down a mortar and pestle. Vish<i>n</i>u desired, ‘May I be an eater of food!’ He saw these two bricks, the mortar and pestle. He placed them on (the altar); and by placing them thereon, he became an eater of food. In like manner, when the Sacrificer now places a mortar and pestle thereon, (he does so) thinking, ‘I want to be an eater of food by the same means (rûpa), by performing the same rite by which Vish<i>n</i>u became an eater of food.’ Now the mortar and pestle mean all (kinds of) food; for by the mortar and pestle food is prepared, and by means of them it is eaten.

<span id="v7_5_1_1313"><sup><small>7:5:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  He puts them down at the distance of the two reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> [^725],—the reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle: he thus puts food into the middle of him (Agni);—on the north (upper) side (of the central brick): he thus puts the food upon him;—at the distance of a cubit, for from a cubit's distance food is (taken by the hand and) eaten.

<span id="v7_5_1_1414"><sup><small>7:5:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  They measure a span, for Vish<i>n</i>u, when an embryo, was a span long; and these (mortar and pestle) being food, he thus puts food into him (Agni-Vish<i>n</i>u) proportionate to his body. And indeed the food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, <span id="p394"><sup><small>[ p. 394 ]</small></sup></span> and does no harm; but that which is excessive does harm; and that which is too little does not satisfy.

<span id="v7_5_1_1515"><sup><small>7:5:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  They are made of Udumbara wood;—the Udumbara (ficus glomerata) being strength, life-sap, he thus puts strength, life-sap into him. And, again, the Udumbara being all the trees, by putting on those two, he puts all trees on (the altar). At the distance of the two reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (bricks, he places the mortar and pestle),—the ‘seed-shedders’ being these two (worlds [^726]), he thus puts the trees in these two (worlds), and hence there are trees in these two (worlds). It (the mortar) is four-cornered,—there being four quarters, he thus places trees in all the quarters; whence there are trees in all the quarters. It is contracted in the middle, to give it the form of a (real) mortar.

<span id="v7_5_1_1616"><sup><small>7:5:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he places a mortar and pestle thereon. From Pra<i>g</i>âpati, when relaxed, the breath wanted to go out from within. He kept it back by means of food: hence the breath is kept back by food, for he who eats food, breathes.

<span id="v7_5_1_1717"><sup><small>7:5:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  The breath being kept back, the food wanted to go out of him. He kept it back by means of the breath: hence food is kept back by the breath, for he who breathes, eats food.

<span id="v7_5_1_1818"><sup><small>7:5:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  Those two being kept back, strength wanted to go out of him. He kept it back by those two: hence strength is kept back by those two; for he who eats food, breathes; and to him it gives strength.

<span id="v7_5_1_1919"><sup><small>7:5:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  Strength being kept back, those two wanted <span id="p395"><sup><small>[ p. 395 ]</small></sup></span> to go out of him. He kept them back by means of strength: hence those two are kept back by strength; for he to whom one gives strength, breathes and eats food.

<span id="v7_5_1_2020"><sup><small>7:5:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  Those (energies) thus were kept back by one another. Having kept them back by one another, he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) caused them to enter his own self; and that food having entered, all the gods entered along with it; for everything here lives on food.

<span id="v7_5_1_2121"><sup><small>7:5:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  It is thereto that this verse applies,—‘Then, indeed, he became that breath,’—for that breath he then indeed became;—‘having become the great Pra<i>g</i>âpati,’—for great he indeed then became, when those gods entered him;—‘having obtained the benefits, the beneficial,’—the benefits doubtless are the vital airs (breaths), and the beneficial are the food: thus, having obtained all that;—‘when he breathed the breaths in the stronghold;’—the stronghold doubtless is the self (body), and inasmuch as he breathed the breaths, the gods are the breaths; and inasmuch as Pra<i>g</i>âpati breathed, the breath also is Pra<i>g</i>âpati; and verily he who is that breath, he is that Gâyatrî;—and as to that food, that is Vish<i>n</i>u, the deity; and as to that strength, that is the Udumbara (tree).

<span id="v7_5_1_2222"><sup><small>7:5:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  He said, ‘Verily this one has lifted me from out of all evil;’ and because he said he has lifted me out (udabhârshît),' hence (the name) ‘udumbhara;’—‘udumbhara’ doubtless being what is mystically called Udumbara, for the gods love the mystic. ‘Wide space (uru) shall it make (karat) for me!’ he said, hence ‘urukara;’ ‘urukara’ doubtless being what is mystically called ‘ulûkhala’ (the mortar); for the gods love the mystic. Now that mortar is <span id="p396"><sup><small>[ p. 396 ]</small></sup></span> the birth-place of all breaths; and the birth-place of the breaths being the head-

<span id="v7_5_1_2323"><sup><small>7:5:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  It (the mortar) is of the measure of a span, for the head is, as it were, of the measure of a span;—four-cornered, for the head is, as it were, four-cornered;—contracted in the middle, for the head is, as it were, contracted in the middle.

<span id="v7_5_1_2424"><sup><small>7:5:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  Now when the gods restored him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati-Agni), they put all that inside him—breath, food, strength; and in like manner this (Sacrificer) now puts that into him. At the distance of the two reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (he places it),—the reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> being the ribs, and the ribs the middle, it is thus in the middle of (or, inside) him that he puts all that.

<span id="v7_5_1_2525"><sup><small>7:5:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  \[^727], with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 33; <i>Ri</i>k S. I, 22, 191 ‘See ye the deeds of Vish<i>n</i>u’—deed doubtless means power: thus, see ye the powers of Vish<i>n</i>u;—‘whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances,’—ordinance means food: thus, whereby he did behold the food;—'Indra's allied friend,' for he is indeed Indra's allied friend. With a (verse) relating to two deities he sets them down, for the mortar and pestle are two. Once he ‘settles’ them: he thereby makes them one and the same; for one and the same is that food. Having ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_5_1_2626"><sup><small>7:5:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  He then places the fire-pan thereon,—the fire-pan is a womb: a womb (birth-place) he thus gives to him (Agni). He places it on the mortar,—the mortar is the air, and everything that is above this <span id="p397"><sup><small>[ p. 397 ]</small></sup></span> earth is air; and the air is the middle: he thus places the womb in the middle; whence the womb of all beings, even of trees [^728], is in the middle.

<span id="v7_5_1_2727"><sup><small>7:5:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he places the fire-pan thereon;—that same Pra<i>g</i>âpati who became disjointed doubtless is this same fire-pan, for the fire-pan is these worlds, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is these worlds. He places it on the mortar: he thereby establishes him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) in all that—breath, food, strength; and thus he places him se as not to be separated from all that.

<span id="v7_5_1_2828"><sup><small>7:5:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon, having pounded the remainder (of the clay), and having put the fire-pan in its place, he throws (the pounded clay) in front of the fire-pan; for this is the place of that (remainder [^729]), and thus that (remainder) is not separated therefrom [^730]. <span id="p398"><sup><small>[ p. 398 ]</small></sup></span> 7:5:1:2929\. Here now they say, ‘How does that (remainder) of his come to be put on as cooked, as baked?’—In that it is prepared with a sacrificial formula; and, moreover, whatever comes in contact with Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara even thereby comes to be put on as something cooked, as baked.

<span id="v7_5_1_3030"><sup><small>7:5:1:3030.</small></sup></span>  \[He sets the fire-pan down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 34-35\] ‘Steady thou art, supporting,’ the meaning of this has been explained [^731];—‘from here he was at first born, from these wombs, the knower of beings;’ for from these wombs the knower of beings (Agni) was indeed born at first;—‘by the Gâyatrî, the Trish<i>t</i>ubh, and the Anush<i>t</i>ubh, may he, the knowing, bear the offering to the gods!’—by means of these metres he, the knowing, indeed bears the offering to the gods.

<span id="v7_5_1_3131"><sup><small>7:5:1:3131.</small></sup></span>  ‘For sap, for wealth, do thou rest, for might in glory, for strength, for offspring!’ that is, for all that do thou rest!—‘all-ruling thou art, self-ruling thou art!’ for both all-ruling and self-ruling he (Agni) indeed is;—‘may the two Sârasvata wells cheer thee!’ Sarasvat (m.) is the Mind, and Sarasvatî (f.) Speech,—these two are the Sârasvata wells: thus, may these two cheer thee! With two (formulas) he sets it down: the significance of this has been explained; and, moreover, twofold is that form, (consisting as it does of) clay and water. Having ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_5_1_3232"><sup><small>7:5:1:3232.</small></sup></span>  He then offers upon it;—now seed was poured into it before, (in the shape of) sand [^732]; that he now <span id="p399"><sup><small>[ p. 399 ]</small></sup></span> fashions [^733], whence the seed injected into the womb is fashioned. He offers with the dipping-spoon, with ‘Hail!’ with two Gâyatrî verses relating to Agni: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_5_1_3333"><sup><small>7:5:1:3333.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 36-37; <i>Ri</i>k S. VI, 16, 43 VIII, 75,1\] ‘O Agni, harness those good steeds of thine: they draw equal to thy mettle!—Like a chariot-fighter, harness thou the steeds, the best callers of the gods, O Agni! take thy seat as the old Hot<i>ri</i>!’ with two (verses) containing the (verb) ‘yu<i>g</i>’ (to harness, fasten),—he thus settles that seed injected into the womb, whence the seed settled in the womb does not escape.

<span id="v7_5_1_3434"><sup><small>7:5:1:3434.</small></sup></span>  If (the fire in the pan) has been carried about for a year [^734], in that case he should now offer; for (the fire) which has been carried about for a year is everything, and that also whereon he offers is everything. But if it has not been carried about for a year, let him only stand by (worshipping) it; for (the fire) which has not been carried about for a year is not everything; and that by which he stands (worshipping) is not everything. Let him nevertheless offer thereon.

<span id="v7_5_1_3535"><sup><small>7:5:1:3535.</small></sup></span>  Now that Agni is an animal, and even now he is (being) made up whole and complete: the naturally-perforated (brick) is his lower vital air, the <span id="p400"><sup><small>[ p. 400 ]</small></sup></span> dviya<i>g</i>us the hip, the two reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> the ribs, the vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis the breast-bone, the two seasonal ones the back, the ashâ<i>dh</i>â the neck, the tortoise the head, and the vital airs in the tortoise are those vital airs in the head.

<span id="v7_5_1_3636"><sup><small>7:5:1:3636.</small></sup></span>  Now that (Agni) he builds upwards from here (as flying) towards the east, and that Agni being yonder sun, he thereby places yonder sun upwards from here in the east; whence yonder sun is placed upwards from here in the east.

<span id="v7_5_1_3737"><sup><small>7:5:1:3737.</small></sup></span>  He then turns him towards the right [^735],—he thereby turns yonder sun towards the right, whence yonder sun moves round these worlds (from left) to right.

<span id="v7_5_1_3838"><sup><small>7:5:1:3838.</small></sup></span>  The fire-pan is the belly, the mortar the womb;—the fire-pan is above, and the mortar below; for the belly is above, and the womb below. The pestle is the <i>s</i>i<i>s</i>na; it is round-like, for the <i>s</i>i<i>s</i>na is round-like. He places it to the right (south of the mortar), for the male lies on the right side of the female. And what food there is for the consecrated animal, that is the dûrvâ-brick. The left (north) side of that (Agni or altar) is more raised,—that Agni is an animal, and hence the left side of the belly of a well-filled beast is more raised (than the right side).


<span id="v7_5_2"><sup><small>7:5:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v7_5_2_11"><sup><small>7:5:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He puts the heads of the victims in (the fire-pan),—the heads of the victims being animals (or cattle), it is animals he thus puts thereon. He puts them in the fire-pan;—the pan being these worlds, and the heads of the victims being beasts, he thus <span id="p401"><sup><small>[ p. 401 ]</small></sup></span> puts animals in these worlds; whence there are animals in these worlds.

<span id="v7_5_2_22"><sup><small>7:5:2:22.</small></sup></span>  And as to why (he puts the heads) in the fire-pan;—the fire-pan being a womb, and the heads of the victims being animals, he thus establishes the animals in the womb: hence animals, though being eaten and cooked, do not diminish, for he establishes them in the womb.

<span id="v7_5_2_33"><sup><small>7:5:2:33.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims therein;—what (animal) perfections (<i>s</i>rî) [^736] there were, they are these victims’ heads; and what rumps there were, they are those five layers (of the altar). Now those five layers are these worlds, and these worlds are this very fire-pan: thus, when he puts the heads of the victims in the fire-pan, he thereby unites those rumps with those heads.

<span id="v7_5_2_44"><sup><small>7:5:2:44.</small></sup></span>  He puts them in the fore-part, so as to look towards the back (west). For when, on that (former) occasion, Pra<i>g</i>âpati wanted to slaughter these animals, they, being about to be slaughtered, wanted to run away. He seized them by (the organs of) the vital airs [^737]; and having seized them by the vital airs, he took them into himself from the front (mouth) towards the back (inside).

<span id="v7_5_2_55"><sup><small>7:5:2:55.</small></sup></span>  Now the same thing which the gods did is done here. The animals do not, indeed, want to run away from him; but when he does this, it is because he wants to do what the gods did: having thus seized them by (the outlets of) the vital airs, he takes them into himself from the front towards the back. <span id="p402"><sup><small>[ p. 402 ]</small></sup></span> 7:5:2:66\. And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims thereon. Pra<i>g</i>âpati alone was here at first [^738]. He desired, ‘May I create food, may I be reproduced!’ He fashioned animals from his vital airs, a man from his soul (mind), a horse from his eye, a cow from his breath, a sheep from his ear, and a goat from his voice; and inasmuch as he created them from the vital airs, people say that ‘Animals are vital airs.’ The soul is the first of the vital airs; and inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that ‘Man is the first, and strongest of animals.’ The soul is all the vital airs, for in the soul all the vital airs are established. And inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that ‘Man is all animals,’ for they all belong to man.

<span id="v7_5_2_77"><sup><small>7:5:2:77.</small></sup></span>  Having created that food, he took it into himself from the front towards the back; and hence whosoever prepares for himself food, takes it into himself from the front towards the back (inside). That (animal food being put) in the fire-pan, and the fire-pan being the belly, he thus puts the food into the belly.

<span id="v7_5_2_88"><sup><small>7:5:2:88.</small></sup></span>  He now (in the first place [^739]) thrusts gold chips into each of them,—gold is vital air, and the vital airs go out of these animals when slaughtered: thus, when he thrusts gold chips into each of them, he puts the vital airs into them.

<span id="v7_5_2_99"><sup><small>7:5:2:99.</small></sup></span>  Seven (chips) he thrusts into each,—seven vital airs there are in the head: these he thereby puts into it. And if there are five victims, let him thrust in five times seven (chips); for those five victims he puts on (the fire-pan), and there are seven vital <span id="p403"><sup><small>[ p. 403 ]</small></sup></span> airs in each victim: he thus puts the vital airs into all of them.

<span id="v7_5_2_1010"><sup><small>7:5:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  Now, even if there is only one victim [^740], some people thrust five times seven (into that one head), thinking, ‘Those five victims he puts down (symbolically), and there are seven vital airs in each victim: thus we put the vital airs into all of them.’ Let him not do so, for in this animal the form of all animals is contained [^741]; and when he thrusts (seven chips) into this one, he thereby puts the vital airs into all of them.

<span id="v7_5_2_1111"><sup><small>7:5:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  The first (chip) he thrusts into the mouth, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 38; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 58, 6, 5), ‘Fitly flow the draughts of milk like rivers,’—draughts of milk are food, and that indeed flows fitly into this mouth;—‘purified within by the heart, by the mind,’—for the food is indeed purified by the heart and mind within him who is righteous;—‘the streams of ghee I behold,’ he thereby means the libations he is about to offer on that fire;—‘the golden reed (is) in the middle of Agni,’ he thereby means that gold man.

<span id="v7_5_2_1212"><sup><small>7:5:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 39), ‘For praise thee!’ (he thrusts one in) here (into the right nostril); praise (or splendour) means breath, for with breath one praises;—with, ‘For sheen thee!’ here (into the left nostril); sheen means breath, for by breath one shines; and also because everything here shines for breath;—with, ‘For brightness thee!’ here (into the right eye);—with, ‘For lustre thee!’ here <span id="p404"><sup><small>[ p. 404 ]</small></sup></span> (into the left eye), for bright and lustrous these two eyes indeed are;—with, ‘This hath become the fiery spirit of all the world, and of Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara,’ here (into the right ear);—with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 40), ‘Agni, bright with brightness, the golden disk, lustrous with lustre,’ here (into the left ear),—thus with two (formulas) containing ‘all [^742]’; for the ear is all.

<span id="v7_5_2_1313"><sup><small>7:5:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then lifts up the human head—he thereby exalts it—with, ‘Giver of a thousand thou art: for a thousand thee!’ a thousand means everything: thus, ‘the giver of everything, for everything (I bestow) thee!’

<span id="v7_5_2_1414"><sup><small>7:5:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then puts them (the heads) in (the fire-pan), first (that of) the man—having taken possession of the man by strength he sets him up;—the man in the middle; on both sides the other victims: he thus sets the man, as the eater, in the midst of cattle; whence man is the eater in the midst of cattle.

<span id="v7_5_2_1515"><sup><small>7:5:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  The horse and ram on the left (north) side: he thereby puts those two (kinds of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle are most plentiful in that region.

<span id="v7_5_2_1717"><sup><small>7:5:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  The (head of the) man he places on the milk [^743],—milk means cattle: he thus establishes the Sacrificer among cattle,—with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 41), ‘With <span id="p405"><sup><small>[ p. 405 ]</small></sup></span> milk anoint thou Âditya, the unborn child!’ that unborn child, the man, is indeed the sun: thus, Him anoint thou with milk!—‘the all-shaped maker of a thousand,’ the maker [^744] of a thousand is man; for to him belong a thousand;—‘spare him with thy heat, harbour not evil thoughts against him!’ that is, spare him with thy fire, do not hurt him!—‘make him live a hundred years, while thou art built!’ he thereby makes man the one among animals (capable of) living a hundred years; whence man, among animals, lives up to- a hundred years.

<span id="v7_5_2_2222"><sup><small>7:5:2:2222.</small></sup></span>  These are the victims; separately he puts them down, separately he ‘settles’ them, and separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas on them; for separate from one another are those animals.

<span id="v7_5_2_2323"><sup><small>7:5:2:2323.</small></sup></span>  He then offers on the human head,—sacrifice is offering: he thus makes man the one among animals fit to sacrifice; whence man alone among animals performs sacrifice.

<span id="v7_5_2_2424"><sup><small>7:5:2:2424.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he offers thereon:—he thereby lays vigour into the head. He offers with ghee,—ghee is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: he thus lays vigour into it. With ‘Hail’ (he offers),—the ‘Hail’ (svâhâkâra, m.) is a male, and the male means vigour: he thus lays vigour into it. With a trish<i>t</i>ubh verse (he offers);the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt <span id="p408"><sup><small>[ p. 408 ]</small></sup></span> means vigour; the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is vigour: with vigour he thus lays vigour into it.

<span id="v7_5_2_2525"><sup><small>7:5:2:2525.</small></sup></span>  Having run through [^753] the (first) half-verse, he pronounces the Svâhâ;—the <i>ri</i><i>k</i> (verse) is a bone: having cleft asunder that skull-bone which is here inside the head, he there lays vigour into it.

<span id="v7_5_2_2626"><sup><small>7:5:2:2626.</small></sup></span>  Having then run through the (second) half-verse, he pronounces the Svâhâ,—having joined together that skull-bone which is here on the top of the head, he there lays vigour into it.

<span id="v7_5_2_2727"><sup><small>7:5:2:2727.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 46; <i>Ri</i>k S.

<span id="v7_5_2_2828"><sup><small>7:5:2:2828.</small></sup></span>  He then stands by (the heads, revering them) with the Utsargas [^754]. For at that time when Pra<i>g</i>âpati wanted to slaughter the victims, they, being about to be slaughtered, were distressed (or pained); and by these Utsargas he drove out their distress [^755], their evil. In like manner does this one, by these Utsargas, now drive out their distress, their evil.

<span id="v7_5_2_2929"><sup><small>7:5:2:2929.</small></sup></span>  Now some remove the distress of whichever (head of a) victim they put down, thinking lest they might put distress, evil, thereon; but it is they that <span id="p409"><sup><small>[ p. 409 ]</small></sup></span> put distress, evil, thereon; for the distress they remove from the preceding one, they put on (the altar) with the succeeding one.

<span id="v7_5_2_3030"><sup><small>7:5:2:3030.</small></sup></span>  And some revere (the heads) whilst moving round them, thinking, ‘we remove distress upwards;’ but these indeed follow the distress, the evil, upwards; for upwards he (the Sacrificer) goes by this performance [^756], and upwards they remove the distress.

<span id="v7_5_2_3131"><sup><small>7:5:2:3131.</small></sup></span>  Let him remove it outside the fire (-altar); that fire (-altar) being these worlds, he thus puts distress outside these worlds;—outside the Vedi; the Vedi being this earth, he thus puts distress outside this earth; (he does so) standing with his face towards the north; for in that region those animals are, and he thus puts distress into them in the region in which they are.

<span id="v7_5_2_3232"><sup><small>7:5:2:3232.</small></sup></span>  He first removes that of the man—for him he puts down first—with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

<span id="v7_5_2_3636"><sup><small>7:5:2:3636.</small></sup></span>  Then that of the he-goat, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

<span id="v7_5_2_3737"><sup><small>7:5:2:3737.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say,—The pain (heat), the evil of these animals, which Pra<i>g</i>âpati drove out, became these five animals; they, with their pith (sacrificial essence) gone out of them, are pithless, unfit for sacrifice; a Brâhma<i>n</i>a should not eat of them: he consigns them to that region; whence Par<i>g</i>anya does not rain in that region where these are.

<span id="v7_5_2_3838"><sup><small>7:5:2:3838.</small></sup></span>  He returns (to the offering-fire) and stands thereby worshipping it;—for when he goes outside the Vedi, whilst Agni (the fire-altar) is only half built up, he does what is improper; he now makes amends to him to prevent his doing injury. With <span id="p413"><sup><small>[ p. 413 ]</small></sup></span> a verse to Agni (he worships): it is to Agni he thereby makes amends;—with an undefined one; the undefined means everything: by means of everything he thus makes amends to him;—with (a verse) containing the word ‘youngest:’ this indeed, to wit, the youngest, is his favourite form.;—inasmuch as when born he took possession (yu) of everything here, he is the youngest (yavish<i>th</i>a).

<span id="v7_5_2_3939"><sup><small>7:5:2:3939.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 52; <i>Ri</i>k S.

<span id="v7_5_2_4040"><sup><small>7:5:2:4040.</small></sup></span>  Having stepped on the altar and walked round behind the naturally-perforated (brick), he lays down the Apasyâ<i>h</i> (water-bricks);—now the Apasyâ<i>h</i> are the same as water, and the water has gone out of these victims: he thus puts water into these victims, when he lays down the Apasyâ<i>h</i> (bricks). He lays them down close to the (heads of the) animals: he thereby puts the water together with the animals. He lays down five (bricks) in each quarter, for five are those victims. He lays them down in every (quarter): everywhere he thus puts water into them.

<span id="v7_5_2_4141"><sup><small>7:5:2:4141.</small></sup></span>  Now the first fifteen are the Apasyâ<i>h</i>,—water is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold;—hence wherever the waters flow, there they destroy evil; and verily the thunderbolt destroys the evil of this place: hence, when it rains one should go about uncovered, thinking, ‘May that thunderbolt remove evil from me!’ <span id="p414"><sup><small>[ p. 414 ]</small></sup></span> 7:5:2:4242\. And the last five are the <i>Kh</i>andasyâ<i>h</i> (the metres’ bricks);—the metres are cattle, and cattle is food; or rather the flesh of cattle is food, and the flesh has departed from these victims: he therefore puts flesh on those cattle when he lays down the <i>Kh</i>andasyâ<i>h</i>. He places them close to the victims: he thereby puts the flesh close to the (bones of the) cattle. The Apasyâ<i>h</i> are inside, the <i>Kh</i>andasyâ<i>h</i> outside; for the water is inside, and the flesh outside.

<span id="v7_5_2_4343"><sup><small>7:5:2:4343.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘If there are that water and that flesh, where then is the skin, and where the hair?’ Well, the skin of cattle is food, and the hair of cattle is food; and when he lays down the <i>Kh</i>andasyâ<i>h</i>, that is the skin of the victims, that is their hair. Or, again, those goats’ hair which are in the fire-pan [^763], they are hair. The fire-pan is outside, and the victims’ heads are inside, for outside is the hair, and inside is the body. ‘Whether in the one way, or whether in the other,’ so <i>S</i>ândilya was wont to say, ‘in any case we make up the victims wholly and completely.’

<span id="v7_5_2_4444"><sup><small>7:5:2:4444.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he lays down the Apasyâ<i>h</i>. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was disjointed the water went from him; that being gone, he sank down; and because he sank down (vi<i>s</i>), therefore there are twenty (vi<i>m</i><i>s</i>ati, viz. such bricks). It flowed from his fingers,—the fingers being the end, it (the water) went from him in the end.

<span id="v7_5_2_4545"><sup><small>7:5:2:4545.</small></sup></span>  Now the Pra<i>g</i>âpati who became disjointed is this very Agni who is now being built up; and the water (âpa<i>h</i>) which went from him is these very <span id="p415"><sup><small>[ p. 415 ]</small></sup></span> Apasyâ<i>h</i>;—hence when he lays them down, he thereby puts back into him that very water which went from him: therefore he now lays these down.

## Footnotes

[^723]: 389:1 See [VI, 1, 1, 12](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_12).

[^724]: 390:1 That is to say, each Vedic text is identical with the deity to which it is addressed. Cf. [VI, 5, 1, 2](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_1_2).

[^725]: 391:1 While the bricks generally measure a pâda or foot square, the cubit measures about two feet.

[^726]: 392:1 He sets the tortoise down with three verses; and in muttering the second verse he makes it move while he still holds it in his hand.

[^727]: 392:2 Blyxa octandra, a grassy plant growing in marshy land (‘lotus-flower,’ Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 250).

[^728]: 393:1 The mortar and pestle are to be placed as far north of the central (naturally-perforated) brick, as the two reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> lie in front (towards the east) of it. This distance is ascertained by means of a cord stretched across the bricks hitherto laid down (from the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â to the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â), and knots made in the cord over the centre of the respective bricks.

[^729]: 394:1 I do not see what else could here be referred to than the heaven and the earth (cf. [VII, 4, 2, 22](Book_3_7_4#v7_4_2_22)), though in that case one might rather expect ‘imau (lokau)’ instead of ‘ime.’ Possibly, however, the earth and atmosphere may be intended.

[^730]: 396:1 The mortar, according to the commentaries to Katy., is partly dug into the ground, with the open part upwards; the pestle being then placed to the right (south) of it.

[^731]: 397:1 Viz., according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, because they spring from the germ in the centre of the fruit.

[^732]: 397:2 ? Or, of it (the fire-pan). There is some uncertainty regarding this item of the ceremonial. Kâtyâyana's rule (XVII, 5, 4)—‘Having placed the Ukhâ (pan) on the mortar, pounded the remainder of clay, and thrown it down in front, with the text “Dhruvâ asi,” (of) the Ukhâ’—is evidently intentionally vague. Mahîdhara (on Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 34) gives the following interpretation of it,—‘Having first silently placed the Ukhâ on the mortar, then pounded the remaining clay, and thrown it down on the ground in front of the Ukhâ, let him place the Ukhâ thereon with two formulas.’ According to this, the Ukhâ would only temporarily be placed on the mortar, its proper and permanent place (loka) being on the powdered clay in front (to the east) of the mortar. The text of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, as it stands, however, cannot possibly be construed so as to accord with Mahîdhara's interpretation. This would require some such reading as,—athopa<i>s</i>ayâm pish<i>t</i>vâ, purastâd ukhâyâ upanivapya lokabhâ<i>g</i>am ukhâm karoti. See, however, paragraph [38](Book_3_7_5#v7_5_1_38) below, which evidently applies to the permanent position of the pan.

[^733]: 397:3 For the genitive ‘asya’ (viz. lokasya) with ‘antarita’—instead p. 398 of the more usual ablative—see [VI, 2, 2, 38](Book_3_6_2#v6_2_2_38), ‘prâ<i>n</i>asya tad antariyât.’

[^734]: 398:1 [VII. 4, 2, 5](Book_3_7_4#v7_4_2_5).

[^735]: 398:2 See [VII, 1, 1, 41](Book_3_7_1#v7_1_1_41).

[^736]: 399:1 The verb ‘abhi-k<i>ri</i>’ is here taken in the sense of ‘vi-k<i>ri</i>’ (he gives form to it); and in that sense I would now take it at II, 3; I, 4, ‘he fashions (gives human shape to) that embryo,’ instead of ‘he benefits that embryo.’ The St. Petersburg dictionary proposes the meaning, ‘to do something with reference to (or, for the benefit of).’ The proper German meaning would rather seem to be ‘bearbeiten.’ The preposition ‘abhi’ is probably used here with reference to the ‘abhi-<i>g</i>uhoti.’

[^737]: 399:2 See [p. 269](Book_3_6_7#p269), note [3](Book_3_6_7#fn510).

[^738]: 400:1 ? Viz. by filling up the vacant spaces of the altar from left to right.

[^739]: 401:1 See [VI, 1, 1, 4](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_4); [2, 1, 7](Book_3_6_2#v6_2_1_7).

[^740]: 401:2 That is, by the head, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a.

[^741]: 402:1 See J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, V, p. 391.

[^742]: 402:2 That is, before putting the heads in the fire-pan.

[^743]: 403:1 Viz. a he-goat, as the animal sacrifice to either Pra<i>g</i>âpati, or (Vâyu) Niyutvat; see pp. [178](Book_3_6_2#p178), [184](Book_3_6_2#p184).

[^744]: 403:2 See [VI, 2, 2, 15](Book_3_6_2#v6_2_2_15).

[^745]: 404:1 Only the first of the two formulas, however, contains the word ‘vi<i>s</i>va,’ all.

[^746]: 404:2 The pan was partly filled with sand and milk, see [VII, 1, 1, 41](Book_3_7_1#v7_1_1_41), [44](Book_3_7_1#v7_1_1_44).

[^747]: 405:1 ‘Pratimâ’ is perhaps taken here by the dogmatic expositor in the sense of ‘likeness, counterpart;’ in which case one would have to translate, ‘the counterpart of a thousand, the all-shaped one.’

[^748]: 406:1 See [VI, 4, 3, 10](Book_3_6_4#v6_4_3_10).

[^749]: 406:2 Or, ‘they attend upon him (Agni, the fire-altar) who tends towards the front (east);’ inasmuch as the altar is built in the shape of a bird flying eastwards.

[^750]: 406:3 Or, harm not the cow, the wide-ruling (or wide-shining) Aditi!

[^751]: 406:4 After the two premises (with ‘vai’) the inference seems here to be introduced without any particle. Similarly in paragraph [24](Book_3_7_5#v7_5_2_24); while in paragraph [19](Book_3_7_5#v7_5_2_19) the particle ‘u’ is used to perform that office. Cf. however [VII, 4, 2, 1](Book_3_7_4#v7_4_2_1), where a third parallel clause (which logically might have been the inference) is introduced by ‘u vai.’

[^752]: 406:5 Sâya<i>n</i>a refers to the legend in Taitt. S. II, I, 2, 2, here alluded to:—Svarbhânu, the Âsura, struck the sun with darkness. The gods sought an expiation for that (darkness): the first darkness of his which they dispelled became a black ewe, the second a red one, the third a white one; and what they cut off from the surface of the bone (?) that became a barren sheep, &c.

[^753]: 407:1 Viz. inasmuch as the fire to be ultimately deposited on the fire-altar was taken from the original (hall-door) fire.

[^754]: 407:2 See [VI, 1, 1, 9](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_9).

[^755]: 407:3 That is, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the lord of procreation; see [VI, 1, 2, 6](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_2_6) seq.

[^756]: 408:1 That is, having rapidly muttered it.

[^757]: 408:2 That is, (means of) deliverance or removal, a term applied to the next five mantras.

[^758]: 408:3 Lit. their burning heat (<i>s</i>u<i>k</i>); cf. [par. 32](Book_3_7_5#v7_5_2_32) seq.

[^759]: 409:1 The Sacrificer builds the fire-altar with a view to his securing for himself a place in heaven.

[^760]: 409:2 It is doubtful what is meant here by this term, unless it be a monkey, or a counterfeit human head; cf. [p. 197](Book_3_6_3#p197), note [4](Book_3_6_3#fn405).

[^761]: 410:1 This paraphrase does not make it clear how the author construes and interprets this part of the formula; especially in what sense he takes ‘nishîda.’

[^762]: 410:2 Thus Mahîdhara (gauravar<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> m<i>ri</i>gam). In the St. Petersburg dictionary ‘gaura’ is taken here in the sense of ‘buffalo, bos gavæus.’ The parallelism in the next two formulas might indeed seem to point to that meaning.

[^763]: 411:1 Viz. inasmuch as its wool serves as a cover for man and beast.

[^764]: 412:1 ‘A<i>g</i>a,’ he-goat, is here again taken in the sense of ‘a-<i>g</i>a,’ unborn. As to the gods having sprung from Vâ<i>k</i>, see [VI, 1, 2, 6](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_2_6) seq.

[^765]: 412:2 A fabulous animal with eight legs.

[^766]: 414:1 See [VI, 4, 4, 22](Book_3_6_4#v6_4_4_22); [5, 1, 4](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_1_4).

[^767]: 417:1 The four sets of bricks are placed in the middle of the four sides of the square ‘body’ of the altar-site, or at the ends of the two spines' intersecting each other.
