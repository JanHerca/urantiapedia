## THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_3_1_11"><sup><small>3:3:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He follows her, stepping into seven foot-prints of hers [^157]; he thereby takes possession of her: that <span id="p59">[<sup><small>p. 59</small></sup>]</span> is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints. For when the metres were produced from Vâ<i>k</i> (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the <i>S</i>akvarî, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now draws down towards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints.

<span id="v3_3_1_22"><sup><small>3:3:1:22.</small></sup></span>  It is as Vâ<i>k</i> [^158] that he steps into them; (with the text, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 21), 'Thou art a Vasvî, thou art Aditi, thou art an Âdityâ, thou art a Rudrâ, thou art <i>K</i>andrâ; for she is indeed a Vasvî and Aditi, an Âdityâ, a Rudrâ, <i>K</i>andrâ. ‘May B<i>ri</i>haspati make thee rest in happiness!’—B<i>ri</i>haspati being the Brahman, he thereby means to say, ‘May B<i>ri</i>haspati lead thee hither by means of the good (work) [^159]!’ ‘Rudra, together with the Vasus, is well-pleased with thee:’ this he says to secure her (the cow's) safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra.

<span id="v3_3_1_33"><sup><small>3:3:1:33.</small></sup></span>  They now sit down [^160] round the seventh footprint; and having laid down the piece of gold in the foot-print, he offers. For offering is made on nothing but fire, and the gold has sprung from Agni's seed: and thus that offering of his is indeed made over <span id="p60">[<sup><small>p. 60</small></sup>]</span> the fire. And the clarified butter being a thunderbolt, he now delivers her (the cow) by means of that thunderbolt, the butter; and by delivering her he makes her his own.

<span id="v3_3_1_44"><sup><small>3:3:1:44.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) offers (with the text, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 22), 'On Aditi's head I pour thee;' for Aditi being this earth, it is on the head of the latter that he offers;—‘on the worshipping-ground of the earth’—for on the worshipping-ground of the earth he indeed offers;—'Thou art I<i>d</i>â's footprint, filled with butter, Hail!' for I<i>d</i>â being the cow [^161], he indeed offers on the cow's foot-print; and ‘filled with butter, Hail!’ he says, because it indeed becomes filled with butter when offered upon.

<span id="v3_3_1_55"><sup><small>3:3:1:55.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he takes the wooden sword and draws lines round (the foot-print): the wooden sword being a thunderbolt, it is with the thunderbolt that he draws round it. Thrice he draws round it, so that he encompasses it on all sides with a threefold thunderbolt, for no one to trespass upon it.

<span id="v3_3_1_66"><sup><small>3:3:1:66.</small></sup></span>  He draws the lines (with the texts), ‘Rejoice in us!’ whereby he means to say, ‘Rejoice in the sacrificer!’ Having then, by tracing, cut out the foot-print all round [^162], he throws it into the pan, with, ‘In us is thy kinship,’ whereby he means to say, ‘In the sacrificer is thy kinship.’

<span id="v3_3_1_77"><sup><small>3:3:1:77.</small></sup></span>  He then pours some water on (the place whence the earth has been removed). Wherever in digging they hurt her (the earth) and knock off anything <span id="p61">[<sup><small>p. 61</small></sup>]</span> from her,—water being (a means of) soothing,—that he now soothes by means of water, that he heals by means of water: that is why he pours water thereon.

<span id="v3_3_1_88"><sup><small>3:3:1:88.</small></sup></span>  He then hands (the dust of) the foot-print to the sacrificer, with, ‘In thee is wealth,’—wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, ‘in thee is cattle.’ The sacrificer receives it with, ‘With me [^163] is wealth,’—wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, ‘with me is cattle.’

<span id="v3_3_1_99"><sup><small>3:3:1:99.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu then touches himself (near the heart), with, ‘May we not be deprived of prosperity!’ Thus the Adhvaryu does not exclude himself from (the possession of) cattle.

<span id="v3_3_1_1010"><sup><small>3:3:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon they hand (the dust of) the footprint over to the (sacrificer's) wife. The house being the wife's resting-place, he thereby establishes her in that safe resting-place, the house: for this reason he hands over the (earth of the) foot-print to the wife.

<span id="v3_3_1_1111"><sup><small>3:3:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  The Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> makes her say, ‘Thine, thine [^164] is wealth;’ whereupon he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow. Now, Soma is a male, and the wife is a female, and that Soma-cow becomes here (exchanged for) Soma: a productive union is thus effected;—this is why he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow.

<span id="v3_3_1_1212"><sup><small>3:3:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  He causes her to be looked at (while she pronounces the text, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 23), ‘I have seen eye to eye with the divine intelligence, with the far-seeing Dakshi<i>n</i>â: take <span id="p62">[<sup><small>p. 62</small></sup>]</span> not my life from me, neither will I take thine; may I obtain a hero [^165] in thy sight!’ She thereby asks a blessing: a hero meaning a son, she thereby means to say, ‘May I obtain a son in thy sight!’

<span id="v3_3_1_1313"><sup><small>3:3:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  One that is brown, with red-brown eyes, is (fit to be) a Soma-cow. For when Indra and Vish<i>n</i>u divided a thousand (cows) into three parts, there was one left [^166], and her they caused to propagate herself in three kinds; and hence, even now, if any one were to divide a thousand by three, one would remain over.

<span id="v3_3_1_1414"><sup><small>3:3:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  The brown one, with red-brown eyes, is the Soma-cow; and that ruddy one is the V<i>ri</i>tra-killer's (India's) own, whom the king here chooses for himself [^167] after winning the battle; and the ruddy one with reddish-white eyes [^168] is the Fathers' own whom they slay here for the Fathers.

<span id="v3_3_1_1515"><sup><small>3:3:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  Let, then, the brown one, with red-brown eyes, be the Soma-cow. And if he be unable to obtain a brown one with red-brown eyes, let it be a dark-red [^169] one. And if he be unable to obtain a dark-red one, let it be a ruddy one, one of the <span id="p63">[<sup><small>p. 63</small></sup>]</span> V<i>ri</i>tra-killer's own. But let him nowise turn his fancy upon a ruddy one with reddish-white eyes.

<span id="v3_3_1_1616"><sup><small>3:3:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  Let it be one that is not impregnated. For that Soma-cow is in reality Vâ<i>k</i>, and this Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) is of unimpaired vigour; and of unimpaired vigour is one not (yet) impregnated: let it therefore be one not impregnated. Let it be one that is neither tailless, nor hornless, nor one-eyed, nor ear-less [^170], nor specially marked, nor seven-hoofed [^171];—for such a one is uniform, and uniform is this speech.


<span id="v3_3_2"><sup><small>3:3:2</small></sup></span>

### THE BUYING OF SOMA.

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_3_2_11"><sup><small>3:3:2:11.</small></sup></span>  Having thrown the (earth of the) foot-print (into the pan), he (the Adhvaryu) washes his hands. Now as to why he washes his hands;—clarified butter being a thunderbolt, and the Soma being seed, he washes his hands lest [^172] he should injure the seed, Soma, with the thunderbolt, the ghee.

<span id="v3_3_2_22"><sup><small>3:3:2:22.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he ties the piece of gold to this (finger [^173]). Now, twofold indeed is this (universe),—there is no third,—the truth and the untruth: the gods are the truth and men are the untruth. And gold having sprung from Agni's seed, he ties the gold to this (finger), in order that he may touch the twigs (of the Soma) with the truth, that he may handle the Soma by means of the truth. <span id="p64">[<sup><small>p. 64</small></sup>]</span> 3:3:2:33\. He then orders (the sacrificer's men), ‘Bring thou the Soma-cloth! bring thou the Soma-wrapper! bring thou the head-band!’ Let some shining (cloth) be the Soma-cloth; for this is to be his (king Soma's [^174]) garment, and shining indeed is his garment: and whosoever serves him with a shining (garment), he truly shines. But he who says, ‘(Bring) anything whatsoever,’ he will indeed be anything whatsoever: let the Soma-cloth, therefore, be some splendid (cloth), and the Soma-wrapper one of any kind.

<span id="v3_3_2_44"><sup><small>3:3:2:44.</small></sup></span>  If he can get a head-band, let there be a headband; but if he cannot get a head-band, let him cut off from the Soma-wrapper a piece two or three fingers long, to serve as the head-band. Either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer takes the Soma-cloth, and some one or other the Soma-wrapper.

<span id="v3_3_2_55"><sup><small>3:3:2:55.</small></sup></span>  Now, in the first place, they pick the king (Soma). A pitcher of water is placed close to him, and a Brâhman sits beside him [^175]. Thither they (the priests and sacrificer) now proceed eastward.

<span id="v3_3_2_66"><sup><small>3:3:2:66.</small></sup></span>  While they go there, he (the Adhvaryu) makes <span id="p65">[<sup><small>p. 65</small></sup>]</span> (the sacrificer) say the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 24), ‘Say thou, for me, unto Soma, “This is thy gâyatrî-part (bhâga) [^176]!” Say thou, for me, unto Soma, “This is thy trish<i>t</i>ubh-part!” Say thou, for me, unto Soma, “This is thy <i>g</i>ayatî-part!” Say thou, for me, unto Soma, “Obtain thou the supreme sovereignty of the names of metres!”’ Now, when he (king Soma) is bought, he is bought for one (destination [^177])—for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres; and when they press him, they slay him: hereby now he says to him, ‘It is for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres that I buy thee, not for slaying thee.’ Having gone there, he sits down (behind the Soma) with his face towards the east.

<span id="v3_3_2_77"><sup><small>3:3:2:77.</small></sup></span>  He touches (the Soma-plants), with, ‘Ours thou art,’—thereby he (Soma), now that he has come (as a guest), becomes as it were one of his (the sacrificer's) own (people): for this reason he says, ‘Ours thou art;’—‘Thy pure (juice) is meet for the draught,’ for he will indeed take therefrom the ‘pure draught [^178].’ ‘Let the pickers pick thee!’ this he says for the sake of completeness.

<span id="v3_3_2_88"><sup><small>3:3:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Now some, on noticing any straw or (piece of) wood (among the Soma-plants), throw it away. But let him not do this; for—the Soma being the nobility and the other plants the common people, and the <span id="p66">[<sup><small>p. 66</small></sup>]</span> people being the nobleman's food—it would be just as if one were to take hold of and pull out some (food) he has put in his mouth, and throw it away. Hence let him merely touch it, with, ‘Let the pickers pick thee!’ Those pickers of his do indeed pick it.

<span id="v3_3_2_99"><sup><small>3:3:2:99.</small></sup></span>  He then spreads the cloth (over the ox-hide), either twofold or fourfold, with the fringe towards the east or north. Thereon he metes out the king (Soma); and because he metes out the king, therefore there is a measure,—both the measure among men and whatever other measure there is.

<span id="v3_3_2_1010"><sup><small>3:3:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  He metes out, with a verse to Savit<i>ri</i>; for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods, and so that (Soma) becomes for him impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> to the purchase.

<span id="v3_3_2_1111"><sup><small>3:3:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  He metes out with an ati<i>kh</i>andas-verse; for that one, viz. the ati<i>kh</i>andas [^179], embraces all metres; and so that (Soma) is meted out for him by means of all the metres: therefore he metes out with an ati<i>kh</i>andas-verse.

<span id="v3_3_2_1212"><sup><small>3:3:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  He metes out, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 25), ‘Unto that divine Savit<i>ri</i> within the two bowls [^180], the sage, I sing praises, to him of true <span id="p67">[<sup><small>p. 67</small></sup>]</span> impulse, the bestower of treasures, the wise and thoughtful friend;—he at whose impulse the resplendent light shone high, the golden-handed sage hath measured the ether with his form.’

<span id="v3_3_2_1313"><sup><small>3:3:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  Therewith [^181] he metes out (the Soma) with all (five fingers), therewith with four, therewith with three, therewith with two, therewith with one; therewith with one, therewith with two, therewith with three, therewith with four, therewith with all (fingers); having laid (the two hands) together [^182] he throws (Soma) thereon with the joined open hands.

<span id="v3_3_2_1414"><sup><small>3:3:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  He metes out while bending up and bending down (the fingers). The reason why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down is that he thereby makes those fingers of separate existence, and therefore they are born separate (from each other); and as to his meting out with all (fingers) together, these (fingers) are to be born, as it were, united. This is why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.

<span id="v3_3_2_1515"><sup><small>3:3:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,—he thereby renders them of varied power, and hence these (fingers) are of varied <span id="p68">[<sup><small>p. 68</small></sup>]</span> power. That is why he metes out in bending them up and down.

<span id="v3_3_2_1616"><sup><small>3:3:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,—he thereby harnesses a virâ<i>g</i> [^183] (to ply) thitherwards and hitherwards: going thither-wards, namely, it conveys the sacrifice to the gods, and coming hitherwards it assists men. This is why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.

<span id="v3_3_2_1717"><sup><small>3:3:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  And as to his meting out ten times,—the virâ<i>g</i> is of ten syllables, and the Soma is of virâ<i>g</i> nature: for this reason he metes out ten times.

<span id="v3_3_2_1818"><sup><small>3:3:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  Having gathered up the ends of the Soma-cloth, he (the Adhvaryu) ties them together by means of the head-band, with, ‘For descendants (I tie) thee;’—for it is indeed for (the purpose of obtaining) descendants that he buys it (Soma): what (part of man) here is, as it were, compressed between the head and the shoulders, that he thereby makes it to be for him (the sacrificer) [^184].

<span id="v3_3_2_1919"><sup><small>3:3:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  He then makes a finger-hole in the middle (of the knot), with the text, ‘Let the descendants breathe after thee!’ For, in compressing (the cloth), he, as it were, strangles him (Soma and the sacrificer) and renders him breathless; hereby now he emits his breath from inside, and after him breathing the descendants also breathe: for this reason he says, ‘Let the descendants breathe after thee.’ Thereupon he hands him (Soma) to the Soma-seller. Now, then, of the bargain.


<span id="v3_3_3"><sup><small>3:3:3</small></sup></span>

<span id="p69">[<sup><small>p. 69</small></sup>]</span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_3_3_11"><sup><small>3:3:3:11.</small></sup></span>  He bargains for the king (Soma); and because he bargains for the king, therefore any and everything is vendible here. He says, ‘Soma-seller, is thy king Soma for sale?’—‘He is for sale,’ says the Soma-seller.—‘I will buy him of thee!’—‘Buy him!’ says the Soma-seller.—‘I will buy him of thee for one-sixteenth (of the cow).’—‘King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!’ says the Soma-seller.—‘Yea, King Soma is worth more than that; but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,’ says the Adhvaryu.

<span id="v3_3_3_22"><sup><small>3:3:3:22.</small></sup></span>  'From the cow (comes) fresh milk, from her boiled milk, from her cream, from her sour curds, from her sour cream, from her curdled milk, from her butter, from her ghee, from her clotted curds, from her whey:

<span id="v3_3_3_33"><sup><small>3:3:3:33.</small></sup></span>  ‘I will buy him of thee for one hoof [^185]!’—‘King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!’ says the Soma-seller.—‘Yea, King Soma is worth more than that, but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,’ replies the Adhvaryu; and, having (each time) enumerated the same ten virtues, he says, ‘I will buy him of thee for one foot,’—‘for half (the cow),’—‘for the cow!’—‘King Soma has been bought!’ says the Soma-seller, ‘name the kinds!’

<span id="v3_3_3_44"><sup><small>3:3:3:44.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) says, ‘Gold is thine, a cloth is thine, a goat is thine, a milch cow is thine, a pair of kine is thine, three other (cows) are thine!’ And because they first bargain and afterwards come to terms, therefore about any and everything that is for sale here, people first bargain and afterwards <span id="p70">[<sup><small>p. 70</small></sup>]</span> come to terms. And the reason why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma, is that Soma is already glorified, since Soma is a god. And the Adhvaryu thereby glorifies the cow, thinking, ‘Seeing her virtues he shall buy her!’ This is why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma.

<span id="v3_3_3_55"><sup><small>3:3:3:55.</small></sup></span>  And as to his bargaining five times:—the sacrifice being of equal measure with the year, and there being five seasons in the year, he thus obtains it (the sacrifice, Soma) in five (divisions), and therefore he bargains five times.

<span id="v3_3_3_66"><sup><small>3:3:3:66.</small></sup></span>  He then makes (the sacrificer) say on the gold [^186] (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 26), ‘Thee, the pure, I buy with the pure,’ for he indeed buys the pure with the pure, when (he buys) Soma with gold;—‘the brilliant with the brilliant,’ for he indeed buys the brilliant with the brilliant, when (he buys) Soma with gold;—‘the immortal with the immortal,’ for he indeed buys the immortal with the immortal, when (he buys) Soma with gold.

<span id="v3_3_3_77"><sup><small>3:3:3:77.</small></sup></span>  He then tempts [^187] the Soma-seller (with the gold): ‘In compensation [^188] for thy cow,’ whereby he means to say, ‘With the sacrificer (be) thy cow!’ <span id="p71">[<sup><small>p. 71</small></sup>]</span> He then draws it (the gold) back towards the sacrificer, and throws it down, with, ‘Ours be thy gold!’ whereby he (the sacrificer) takes unto himself the vital energy, and the Soma-seller gets only the body. Thereupon the Soma-seller takes it [^189].

<span id="v3_3_3_88"><sup><small>3:3:3:88.</small></sup></span>  He then makes him (the sacrificer) say on the she-goat, which stands facing the west, ‘Thou art the bodily form of fervour,’—that she-goat was indeed produced as the bodily form of fervour, of Pra<i>g</i>âpati; hence he says, ‘Thou art the bodily form of fervour,’—'Pra<i>g</i>âpati's kind,' because she brings forth three times in the year, therefore she is Pra<i>g</i>âpati's kind. ‘Thou art bought with the most excellent animal,’ because she brings forth three times in the year, she is the most excellent of animals. ‘May I increase with a thousandfold increase!’ Thereby he implores a blessing: a thousand meaning abundance, he thereby means to say, ‘May I obtain abundance!’

<span id="v3_3_3_99"><sup><small>3:3:3:99.</small></sup></span>  With that (text) he gives the she-goat, with that he takes the king [^190]; for a<i>g</i>â (goat) doubtless <span id="p72">[<sup><small>p. 72</small></sup>]</span> means the same as â<i>g</i>â (driving thither [^191]), since it is through her (the she-goat) that he finally drives him (Soma) thither. It is thus in a mystic sense that they call her ‘a<i>g</i>â.’

<span id="v3_3_3_1010"><sup><small>3:3:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  He takes the king, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 27), ‘Come to us, a friend, bestowing good friends!’ whereby he means to say, ‘Come to us, as a kind and propitious one!’ Having pushed back the garment on the sacrificer's right thigh, he lays him (Soma) down thereon, with the text, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh,'—for he, the sacrificer, is at present Indra [^192]: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh;'—‘willing on the willing,’ whereby he means to say, ‘beloved on the beloved one;’—‘tender on the tender!’ whereby he means to say, ‘propitious on the propitious one.’

<span id="v3_3_3_1111"><sup><small>3:3:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he (the sacrificer) assigns (to the Gandharvas) the objects constituting the purchase price for the Soma, with the text, ‘O Svâna, Bhrâ<i>g</i>a, Aṅghâri, Bambhâri, Hasta, Suhasta, K<i>ri</i><i>s</i>ânu! these are your wages for Soma: keep them! may they not fail you!’ Now those (Gandharvas) are instead of the hearth-mounds—these being the names of the hearth-mounds—it is these very (names) that he thereby has assigned to them [^193]. <span id="p73">[<sup><small>p. 73</small></sup>]</span> 3:3:3:1212\. He now uncovers (his head [^194]); for he who is consecrated becomes an embryo, and embryos are enveloped both in the amnion and the outer membrane: him (the sacrificer or sacrifice) he has now brought forth, and therefore he uncovers himself. Now it is he (Soma [^195]) that becomes an embryo, and therefore he is enveloped, since embryos are, as it were, enveloped both in the amnion and the outer membrane.

<span id="v3_3_3_1313"><sup><small>3:3:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then makes (the sacrificer) say the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 28), ‘Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right ways.’ Now he (Soma) approaches him while he is seated, and when he has come, he rises: thereby he does wrong and breaks the vow. This, then, is his expiation of that (transgression), and thus no wrong is thereby done, and he breaks not the vow: therefore he says, ‘Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right ways!’

<span id="v3_3_3_1414"><sup><small>3:3:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  Having then taken the king, he rises, with the text, ‘With new life, with good life, am I risen after the immortals;’ for he who rises after the bought Soma, rises indeed after the immortal: therefore he says,‘ With new life, with good life, am I risen after the immortals.’

<span id="v3_3_3_1515"><sup><small>3:3:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he takes the king and goes towards the car, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 29), ‘We have <span id="p74">[<sup><small>p. 74</small></sup>]</span> entered upon the path that leadeth to wellbeing, free from danger; whereon he escheweth all haters, and meeteth with good [^196].’

<span id="v3_3_3_1616"><sup><small>3:3:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They perceived that prayer for a safe journey; and having warded off the evil spirits by means of that prayer, they attained wellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. And so does he now ward off the evil spirits by means of that prayer, and attain wellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. For this reason he says, ‘We have entered upon the path that leadeth to well-being, free from danger; whereon he escheweth all haters and meeteth with good.’

<span id="v3_3_3_1717"><sup><small>3:3:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  They carry him thus [^197], and (afterwards) drive him about on the cart; whereby they exalt him: for this reason they carry the seed on their head (to the field), and bring in (the corn) on the cart.

<span id="v3_3_3_1818"><sup><small>3:3:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  Now the reason why he buys (the Soma) near water [^198] is that—water meaning sap—he thereby buys Soma sapful; and as to there being gold, he thereby buys him lustrous; and as to there being a cloth, he thereby buys him with his skin; and as to there being a she-goat, he thereby buys him fervid; and as to there being a milch cow, he thereby buys him with the milk to be mixed with him; and as to there being a pair (of kine), he thereby buys him with a mate.—He should buy him with ten (objects), and <span id="p75">[<sup><small>p. 75</small></sup>]</span> not with other than ten, for the virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten syllables, and Soma is of virâ<i>g</i> nature: therefore he should buy him with ten (objects) and not with other than ten.


<span id="v3_3_4"><sup><small>3:3:4</small></sup></span>

### PROCESSION AND ENTRANCE OF KING SOMA.

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_3_4_11"><sup><small>3:3:4:11.</small></sup></span>  In the enclosed space (of the cart) [^199] he (the Adhvaryu) lays down the black deer-skin, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 30), 'Thou art Aditi's skin;' its significance is the same (as before) [^200]. Thereon he places him (Soma), with, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!' for Aditi being this (earth), and she being indeed a safe resting-place, he thereby places him on that safe resting-place: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!’

<span id="v3_3_4_22"><sup><small>3:3:4:22.</small></sup></span>  He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), ‘The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin [^201].’ For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. Now by what he says, ‘The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin,’ <span id="p76">[<sup><small>p. 76</small></sup>]</span> thereby they rendered it (the sacrifice or Soma) superior to the deadly shaft [^202].

<span id="v3_3_4_33"><sup><small>3:3:4:33.</small></sup></span>  ‘He hath measured the breadth of the earth;’—thus he gains through him (Soma) these worlds, for there is no slayer, no deadly shaft for him by whom these worlds have been gained: therefore he says, ‘He hath measured the breadth of the earth.’

<span id="v3_3_4_44"><sup><small>3:3:4:44.</small></sup></span>  ‘As all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing (bhuvana);’—thus he gains through him this All, for there is no slayer, no deadly shaft for him by whom this All has been gained: therefore he says, ‘As all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing.’

<span id="v3_3_4_55"><sup><small>3:3:4:55.</small></sup></span>  'Verily, all these are Varu<i>n</i>a's ordinances;'—thereby he makes here everything whatsoever obedient to him, and every one that is refractory: therefore he says, 'Verily, all these are Varu<i>n</i>a's ordinances.’

<span id="v3_3_4_66"><sup><small>3:3:4:66.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he wraps (the Soma) up in the Soma-wrapper, lest the evil spirits should touch him. For this one doubtless is an embryo, and hidden (tiras), as it were, are embryos, and hidden also is that (which is) wrapped up;—hidden, as it were, are the gods to men, and hidden is that which is wrapped up: therefore he wraps him up.

<span id="v3_3_4_77"><sup><small>3:3:4:77.</small></sup></span>  He wraps him up, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 31; Rig-veda V, 85, 2), ‘Over the woods he hath stretched the welkin,’ for over the woods, over the tops of the trees, that welkin (or air) is indeed stretched;—‘strength (hath he laid) into the coursers, milk into the kine,’—strength means <span id="p77">[<sup><small>p. 77</small></sup>]</span> manliness and the coursers are the men: he thereby bestows manliness upon men; and ‘milk into the kine’ he says, because this milk is indeed contained in the kine;—‘Into the hearts Varu<i>n</i>a (hath laid) wisdom, into the homesteads [^203] fire;’ for into the hearts that wisdom, the swiftness of thought, has indeed entered; and ‘into the homesteads fire’ he says, because that fire is in the homesteads, with the people;—‘Into the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock;’ for that sun is indeed placed in the heaven; and ‘Soma on the rock’ he says, because Soma is in the mountains. This is why he says, ‘In the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock.’

<span id="v3_3_4_88"><sup><small>3:3:4:88.</small></sup></span>  If there are two deer-skins [^204], he then puts up the other by way of a flag [^205];—and if there is only one, he cuts off the neck of the deer-skin and puts it up by way of a flag;—with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 32), ‘Mount thou the eye of Sûrya, the eye-ball of Agni, where thou fliest along with the dappled (horses), shining through the wise (Sûrya).’ He thereby places Sûrya (the sun) in front, thinking, ‘May Sûrya, in front, ward off the evil spirits!’ They now drive (Soma) about on a safe (cart), unmolested by evil spirits.

<span id="v3_3_4_99"><sup><small>3:3:4:99.</small></sup></span>  At the fore-part of the shafts two boards have been put up: between them the Subrâhma<i>n</i>yâ [^206] <span id="p78">[<sup><small>p. 78</small></sup>]</span> stands and drives. He (Soma), indeed, is too high for (the driver) mounting beside him, for who is worthy of mounting beside him? Therefore he drives while standing between (the boards).

<span id="v3_3_4_1010"><sup><small>3:3:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  He drives with a palâ<i>s</i>a branch. Now when Gâyatrî flew towards Soma [^207], a footless archer aiming at her while she was carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (or leaves, par<i>n</i>a), either of Gâyatrî or of king Soma; and on falling down it became a par<i>n</i>a (palâ<i>s</i>a) tree; whence its name par<i>n</i>a. ‘May that which was there of the Soma nature, be here also now!’ so he thinks, and for this reason he drives with a palâ<i>s</i>a branch.

<span id="v3_3_4_1111"><sup><small>3:3:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  He urges on the two oxen. If they be both black, or if either of them be black, then let him know that it will rain, that Par<i>g</i>anya will have abundance of rain that year: such indeed is science.

<span id="v3_3_4_1212"><sup><small>3:3:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) first yokes them, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 33), ‘Ye oxen, come hither, patient of the yoke!’ for they are indeed oxen, and they are patient of the yoke;—‘Let yourselves be yoked, tearless!’ for they are now being yoked; and tearless means unscathed;—‘not man-slaying,’ this means ‘not doing wrong;’—‘speeding the Brahman,’ for they are indeed speeders of the Brahman (worship, or the priests);—'Go ye happily to the sacrificer's dwelling!' this he says in order that the evil spirits may not injure them on the way.

<span id="v3_3_4_1313"><sup><small>3:3:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  Having then gone round to the back (of the <span id="p79">[<sup><small>p. 79</small></sup>]</span> cart) and taken hold of the drag [^208], he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>) [^209], ‘Recite to the bought Soma!’ or,‘—to Soma, now driven about!’ whichever way he pleases.

<span id="v3_3_4_1414"><sup><small>3:3:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then makes (the sacrificer [^210]) say the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 34), ‘Thou art gracious unto me, go forth, O Lord of the world—,’ for he (Soma) is indeed gracious to him, wherefore he heeds no other but him. Even his (Soma's own) kings [^211] come (to <span id="p80">[<sup><small>p. 80</small></sup>]</span> him) to attend the assembly, and he is the first to salute the kings, for he is gracious. This is why he says, ‘Thou art gracious.’ ‘Go forth, O Lord of the world,’ he says, because he (Soma) is the lord of beings. ‘To all dwellings,’ ‘all dwellings’ doubtless means the limbs; with reference to his limbs he says this, ‘May no prowling enemies meet thee! may no waylayers meet thee! May no malicious wolves meet thee!’ this he says lest the evil spirits should meet him on his way.

<span id="v3_3_4_1515"><sup><small>3:3:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  ‘Having become a falcon, fly away!’ he thereby makes him fly forward after becoming a falcon; for the evil spirits fly not after what is fearful: now he, the falcon, forsooth is the most fearful, the strongest of birds, and as such a one he makes him (Soma) fly forwards when he says, ‘Having become a falcon, fly away!’

<span id="v3_3_4_1616"><sup><small>3:3:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  Now they (can) only hit his body [^212]. 'Go to the sacrificer's dwelling,—that is the place prepared for us.' In this there is nothing obscure. <span id="p81">[<sup><small>p. 81</small></sup>]</span> 3:3:4:1717\. Thereupon he recites the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ litany. Even as one would say to those for whom he intends to prepare a meal, ‘On such and such a day I will prepare a meal for you;’ so does he thereby announce the sacrifice to the gods. ‘Subrahma<i>n</i>yôm! Subrahma<i>n</i>yôm! Subrahma<i>n</i>yôm!’ thus he calls, for the Brahman indeed moves the gods onward. Thrice he says it, because the sacrifice is threefold.

<span id="v3_3_4_1818"><sup><small>3:3:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  ‘Come, O Indra!’ Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, ‘Come, O Indra!’ ‘Come, O lord of the bay steeds! Ram of Medhâtithi [^213]! Wife of V<i>ri</i>sha<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>va [^214]! Bestriding buffalo! Lover of Ahalyâ [^215]!’ Thereby he wishes him joy in those affairs of his. <span id="p82">[<sup><small>p. 82</small></sup>]</span> 3:3:4:1919\. ‘O Kau<i>s</i>ika [^216], Brahman, thou who callest thee Gautama [^217].’ Just so has this (formula) been devised in these days by Âru<i>n</i>i, to wit, ‘thou who callest thee Gautama:’ he may say it, if he choose, and if he does not choose, he need not attend to it [^218]. ‘In so and so many days, to the Soma-feast,’ (stating) in how many days from hence the pressing is to be.

<span id="v3_3_4_2020"><sup><small>3:3:4:2020.</small></sup></span>  ‘Ye gods and priests, come hither [^219]!’ This he says to the gods and Brâhmans, because it is of these two, the gods and Brâhmans, that he has need.

<span id="v3_3_4_2121"><sup><small>3:3:4:2121.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> steps up to the front of the hall with the victim for Agni and Soma. Now Agni and Soma have seized him, who consecrates himself, between their jaws, for that consecration-offering above [^220] belongs to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, and Vish<i>n</i>u, forsooth, is no other than <span id="p83">[<sup><small>p. 83</small></sup>]</span> Soma, and the offering is he himself who is consecrated: thus they have seized him between their jaws; and by this victim he now redeems himself [^221].

<span id="v3_3_4_2222"><sup><small>3:3:4:2222.</small></sup></span>  Now, some take a firebrand from the Âhavanîya, saying, ‘Here is Agni, and here is Soma: with these two thus being together we will redeem ourselves.’ But let him not do this; for wheresoever these two are, there they are indeed together.

<span id="v3_3_4_2323"><sup><small>3:3:4:2323.</small></sup></span>  It (the victim) is two-coloured, because it belongs to two deities: ‘For the sake of concord between the two deities let it be a black-spotted (buck)!’ they say; ‘for that is most like those two (gods).’ If he be unable to obtain a black-spotted buck, it may be a red-spotted one.

<span id="v3_3_4_2424"><sup><small>3:3:4:2424.</small></sup></span>  Thereon he makes (the sacrificer) say (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 35; Rig-veda X; 37, 1); ‘Homage be to the eye of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a! perform ye diligently this holy service to the god! sing ye unto the far-seeing, god-born light, to Sûrya, the son of the sky!’ Thereby he renders homage to it (the victim) and makes it a token of the covenant.

<span id="v3_3_4_2525"><sup><small>3:3:4:2525.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu then removes the Soma-wrapper. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 36) 'Thou art Varu<i>n</i>a's stay,' he props (the cart) with the prop. With 'Ye two are the rest of Varu<i>n</i>a's stay,' he pulls out the two wedges. The reason why he says, 'Ye two are the rest of Varu<i>n</i>a's stay [^222],' is that he, the bought Soma, now indeed is of Varu<i>n</i>a [^223]. <span id="p84">[<sup><small>p. 84</small></sup>]</span> 3:3:4:2626\. Thereupon four men take up the king's throne; two men, it is true, take it up for the human king, but four take up this for him who rules over everything here.

<span id="v3_3_4_2727"><sup><small>3:3:4:2727.</small></sup></span>  It is of udumbara wood—udumbara meaning sap and food—for (the sacrificer's) obtainment of sap and food: therefore it is of udumbara wood.

<span id="v3_3_4_2828"><sup><small>3:3:4:2828.</small></sup></span>  It reaches up to his navel, for it is there that the food settles, and Soma is food: therefore it reaches up to his navel. Moreover, there is the seat of the seed, and Soma is seed: therefore it reaches up to his navel.

<span id="v3_3_4_2929"><sup><small>3:3:4:2929.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) touches it with, ‘Thou art the rightful seat (<i>ri</i>tasadanî) of Varu<i>n</i>a!’ He then spreads on it the black deerskin with, ‘Thou art the rightful seat (<i>ri</i>tasadanam) of Varu<i>n</i>a!’ and places him (Soma) thereon with, ‘Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varu<i>n</i>a!’ The reason why he says, ‘Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varu<i>n</i>a,’ is that he (Soma) is now of Varu<i>n</i>a's nature.

<span id="v3_3_4_3030"><sup><small>3:3:4:3030.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he makes him (king Soma) enter the hall; and in making him enter, he causes (the sacrificer) to say (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 37; Rig-veda I, 91, 19), ‘Whatsoever powers of thine they worship with offering, may they all encompass the sacrifice [^224]! Go forth to our dwellings, O Soma, prospering our homes, ever helpful, bestowing abundance of men, not slaying our <span id="p85">[<sup><small>p. 85</small></sup>]</span> men!’ dwellings meaning houses, he thereby means to say, ‘Go forth to our houses, kind, propitious, not doing evil.’

<span id="v3_3_4_3131"><sup><small>3:3:4:3131.</small></sup></span>  Some now pour out a vessel of water beside him, saying that this would be as. one would bring water for a king that has come to him. But let him not do this, for they (who do this) do at the sacrifice what is human, and inauspicious for the sacrifice forsooth is that which is human: let him therefore not pour out water, lest he should do at the sacrifice what is inauspicious.

## Footnotes

[^158]: 58:2 Viz. into seven foot-prints of her right fore-foot. According to p. 59 Taitt. S. VI, 1, 8, 1 he steps into six foot-prints and offers on the seventh. According to Kâty. VII, 6, 17 they pass (or overstep, atikram) six foot-prints and sit down round the seventh.

[^159]: 59:1 Literally, ‘by a form (rûpe<i>n</i>a) of Vâ<i>k</i> (speech),’ viz. the text which is pronounced.

[^160]: 59:2 This can scarcely be the correct reading. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has the more acceptable reading, ‘B<i>ri</i>haspati being the Brahman, and felicity the sacrifice, he thereby says, “May the Brahman make thee rest (or delight, ramayatu) in the good (work), the sacrifice!”’

[^161]: 59:3 According to the comm. on Kâty. VII, 6, 17 the Brahman and the Sacrificer are to sit on the south, the Adhvaryu on the west, and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> on the north side of the foot-print.

[^162]: 60:1 See the legend, part i, p. 216 seq.; especially I, 8, 1, 7; 20; and p. 226, note 3.

[^163]: 60:2 According to the comm. on Kâty. VII, 6, 20, it would rather seem that he scratches with the sphya all over the foot-print and then takes out the loose dust (pâ<i>m</i>sûn) and throws it into the pan.

[^164]: 61:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text (Sa<i>m</i>hitâ and Br.) has asme instead of me.

[^165]: 61:2 See St. Petersb. Dict. s. v. totas. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text explains it similarly: ‘tvayi tvayi pa<i>s</i>ava<i>h</i>.’ The Taitt. S. VI, 1, 8, 5 has ‘Tote râya<i>h</i>’—“Thine (?) is wealth” thus for the wife, for she, the wife, is one half of himself.’

[^166]: 62:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads ‘may I obtain heroes.’

[^167]: 62:2 This arithmetical feat of Indra and Vish<i>n</i>u is apparently already referred to in Rig-veda VI, 69, 8, though nothing is said there as to the difficulty regarding the odd cow. The threefold division seems to refer to Vish<i>n</i>u's three steps, by which (as the sun) he measures the sky; or to the division of the universe into the three worlds (?). See also Ait. Br. VI, 15.

[^168]: 62:3 Or, drives forth (from the enemy's stables). The red cows are compared with the red clouds, which appear after the thunderstorm (i.e. after king Indra's battle with V<i>ri</i>tra).

[^169]: 62:4 Sâya<i>n</i>a takes ‘<i>s</i>yetâkshî’ as ‘black-eyed (k<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>alo<i>k</i>anâ).’

[^170]: 62:5 ‘Aru<i>n</i>â;’ the Kâ<i>n</i>va text adds, ‘for that one nearest to it (the brown one, or Soma-cow proper) in appearance.’

[^171]: 63:1 ‘Akar<i>n</i>â;’ the Kâ<i>n</i>va text has ‘anupârsh<i>t</i>akar<i>n</i>â (one whose ears are not perforated?),’ and instead of ‘alakshitâ (not specially marked),’ it reads ‘a<i>s</i>ro<i>n</i>â (a<i>s</i>lo<i>n</i>â), not lame.’

[^172]: 63:2 That is, with one hoof undivided (seven-toed).

[^173]: 63:3 The construction in the original is as usual in the oratio directa.

[^174]: 63:4 Viz. to the nameless (or ring) finger. Kâty. VII, 6, 27.

[^175]: 64:1 I do not think ‘asya’ could refer to the sacrificer, in opposition to ‘etasya’ (Soma); nor can the latter be construed with the following relative clause ‘sa yo . . .’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, Tad yad eva <i>s</i>obhanatama<i>m</i> tat somopanahana<i>m</i> syâd, vâso by asyaitad bhavati; sa yo haita<i>k</i> <i>kh</i>obhanatama<i>m</i> kurute, <i>s</i>obhate haiva sa<i>h</i>, &c.

[^176]: 64:2 The Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>, in the first place, takes the Soma-plants (from the seller) and puts them on an ox-hide, dyed red and spread on the ground at the place (in the east of the hall) where the ‘sounding-holes’ will be dug (see [III, 5, 4, 1](Book_2_3_5#v3_5_4_1) seq.). The seller of the Soma, who is to be either of the Kutsa tribe or a <i>S</i>ûdra, then picks the Soma, breaking the plants at the joints. A jar filled with water is placed in front of the Soma, and a Brâhman (or the assistant of the Brahman, viz. the Brâhma<i>n</i>â_kh<i>a</i>m_sin) sits down by the (right or south) side of the Soma. Kâty. VII, 6, 1-6.

[^177]: 65:1 The three parts refer to the three Savanas, at which the respective metres are used. See [IV, 3, 2, 7](Book_2_4_3#v4_3_2_7) seq.

[^178]: 65:2 Bhâgam appears to have been lost here, since a play on that word seems to be intended, which might perhaps be reproduced by lot.' It is given both at the Kâ<i>n</i>va text and at [III, 4, 1, 7](Book_2_3_4#v3_4_1_7).

[^179]: 65:3 For the <i>S</i>ukra-graha, see [IV, 2, 1, 1](Book_2_4_2#v4_2_1_1) seq.

[^180]: 66:1 Ati<i>kh</i>andas (‘over-metre’) is the generic name for the metres which number more than forty-eight syllables: hence it is said to include all the other metres which consist of fewer syllables. See VIII, 6, 2, 23, where the term is explained by atti-<i>kh</i>andâ<i>h</i> (metre-eater).’

[^181]: 66:2 Or, that divine invigorator of the two ‘o<i>n</i>i.’ According to the St. Petersb. Dict., ‘o<i>n</i>i’ would seem to refer to two parts of the Soma-press. Professor Ludwig takes it to mean ‘press-arm’ and the ‘arm’ generally, which suits very well some of the passages in which the word occurs. Here, in the loc. or gen. case, it can scarcely mean ‘arms’ (though Savit<i>ri</i>'s two arms are often referred to as dispelling the darkness and keeping asunder the spaces, cf. Rig-veda II, 38, 2; IV, 53, 3; 4; VI, 75, 1; 5; VII, 45, 2), but apparently refers to ‘heaven and earth’ being thus equivalent to p. 67 the two <i>k</i>amû (originally the two receptacles or bowls into which the pressed Soma flows) in Rig-veda III, 55, 20.

[^182]: 67:1 Viz. with the same formula, repeating it each time. The meting out of the Soma is done with the fingers of the right hand, first with all five, and then successively turning in one (beginning with the thumb), till the little finger remains with which he takes Soma twice, whereupon he again successively releases the fingers.

[^183]: 67:2 There is some doubt as to whether this refers to the preceding ‘with all (viz. ten fingers);’ or whether he is to take for the tenth time some Soma with the five fingers of the right hand, and then once more (without muttering the text) with the joined hands. See Kâty. VII, 7, 18, 29. The text seems to be purposely vague.

[^184]: 68:1 The virâ<i>g</i> (the shining' or ‘ruling’ metre) consists of (generally three or four) pâdas of ten syllables each: hence it is here connected with the ten metings out of Soma.

[^185]: 68:2 The Soma representing offspring, he gives the bundle a shape resembling the human body.

[^186]: 69:1 That is, for one-eighth of a cow, each foot consisting of two hoofs (or toes, <i>s</i>apha).

[^187]: 70:1 That is, according to Kâty. VII, 8, 5, in making him touch the gold. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has, ‘Thereupon he buys him (Soma) with gold.’

[^188]: 70:2 Or, according to the commentaries, ‘he frightens the Soma-seller (by threatening to take back the money).’

[^189]: 70:3 ? Sagme (? compact), explained by the commentators as meaning the sacrificer. Perhaps it may mean, ‘one of the parties to an agreement,’ and hence here the sacrificer as the bargainee. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, He then takes it back again (punar âdatte) with ‘Sagme to go<i>h</i>,’ and throws it down with ‘Ours thy gold.’

[^190]: 71:1 According to some authorities, the gold is again taken away forcibly from the Soma-seller by the Adhvaryu, after the sacrificer has uncovered his head (paragraph a 2), and the seller is driven away by blows with a speckled cane. Kâty. VII, 8, 27. According to Âpastamba (ib.), he buys off the Soma-cow with another cow, and then dismisses her to the cow-pen; and if the Soma-seller objects, he is to be beaten with a speckled cane. The Mânava-sûtra merely says, that they are to give the Soma-seller something for compensation. The whole transaction was evidently a feigned purchase, symbolising the acquisition of the Soma by the gods from the Gandharvas. The real bargain was probably concluded before the sacrificial performance. See also Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 59, note 2.

[^191]: 71:2 While making over the she-goat to the Soma-seller with his left hand, he receives the Soma with the right.

[^192]: 72:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a takes â-a<i>g</i> in the sense of ‘to go to, to come’ (â<i>g</i>â, the corner); because the sacrificer through her comes to Soma.

[^193]: 72:2 See part i, introduction, p. xix, note 4.

[^194]: 72:3 ‘For those same Gandharvas, the overseers of the Guardians of Soma, they are (meant) in lieu of those (? hearth-mounds), for those are their names: it is to them that he thereby assigns those (objects constituting the purchase-price), and thus he becomes debtless towards them.’ Kâ<i>n</i>va text. See also part i, p. 183, note 2.

[^195]: 73:1 See [III, 2, 1, 16](Book_2_3_2#v3_2_1_16). His wife does the same.

[^196]: 73:2 According to a former passage ([III, 1, 3, 28](Book_2_3_1#v3_1_3_28)), the sacrificer is supposed to remain in the embryonic state till the pressing of the Soma. The Kâ<i>n</i>va recension reads, ‘Sa etam ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>am a<i>g</i>î<i>g</i>anat sa esha garbho bhavaty â sutyâyâ<i>h</i>;’ where ‘a<i>g</i>î<i>g</i>anat’ seems to mean ‘he has begotten.’ I am not quite certain whether Soma himself is really implied. See [III, 3, 4, 6](Book_2_3_3#v3_3_4_6).

[^197]: 74:1 Compare the slightly different verse, Rig-veda VI, 51, 16.

[^198]: 74:2 The sacrificer carries the bundle of Soma on his hand resting on his head.

[^199]: 74:3 Viz. the vessel of water mentioned [III, 1, 2, 2](Book_2_3_1#v3_1_2_2).

[^200]: 75:1 The cart stands south of the place where the purchase of Soma took place, with the shafts towards the east, fitted with all the appliances, and yoked with a pair of oxen. The antelope skin is spread with the hairy side upwards, and the neck part towards the east.

[^201]: 75:2 See I, 1, 4, 1 seq. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has: ‘the significance of this ya<i>g</i>us is the same.’

[^202]: 75:3 In Rig-veda VIII, 42, 1, this verse relates to Varu<i>n</i>a. In adapting it to the present sacrificial requirements, ‘v<i>ri</i>shabho (<i>ri</i>shabho, K.) antariksham’ has been substituted for the original ‘asuro vi<i>s</i>vavedâ<i>h</i>;’ Soma being meant by ‘the bull.’

[^203]: 76:1 Or, superior to (beyond the reach of) the slayer (or the blow), ‘<i>g</i>yâyâ<i>m</i>sa<i>m</i> vadhât.’

[^204]: 77:1 ‘Into the waters (apsu),’ Rig-veda.

[^205]: 77:2 See [III, 2, 1, 1](Book_2_3_2#v3_2_1_1) seq.

[^206]: 77:3 He is to fasten it to a staff fixed to the pole of the cart near the yoke. Kâty. VII, 9, 9.

[^207]: 77:4 The Subrâhma<i>n</i>yâ is one of the assistants of the Udgât<i>ri</i> (chanter of Sâma-hymns). He stands on the ground between the two shafts in front of the yoke; the two planks, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, reaching up to his chin.

[^208]: 78:1 See I, 7, 1, I; part i, p. 183. According to Ait. Br. III, 26, K<i>ri</i>sânu the Soma-keeper's arrow cut off one of the talons of Gâyatrî's left foot, which was turned into a porcupine.

[^209]: 79:1 Apâlamba, a piece of wood fastened to the back part of the cart to prevent its running backwards when going up-hill; or, according to others, a rope used for retarding the progress of the cart in going down-hill. Kâty. VII, 9, 15 comm. The cart stands with the oxen towards the east; it is then wheeled round towards the right to the west and driven to the hall, in front of which it is turned towards the north; the Soma being then taken down. See Ait. Br. I, 14.

[^210]: 79:2 The duties of the Hot<i>ri</i>, while the Soma-cart is driven to the hall, are set forth Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>rautas. IV, 4: He stands three feet behind the cart between the two wheel tracks, and throws thrice dust towards the south with the fore-part of his foot without moving the heel, with the formula, ‘Thou art wise, thou art intelligent, thou upholding all things: drive away the danger arising from men!’ Thereupon, after uttering the sound ‘Him,’ he recites eight verses, or, the first and last being recited thrice each, in all twelve verses. Cf. Ait. Br. I, 13. He first remains standing in the same place and recites thrice the first verse. Then in following the cart he recites the five following verses. The cart having now stopped, he walks round it on its right (south) side, and while looking on the Soma follows it while it is placed on the throne. He then touches it and completes his recitation by the last two verses. The first of these two verses is the same which the sacrificer is to mutter (with the Adhvaryu) while Soma is carried into the hall, and which is given in [paragraph 30](Book_2_3_3#v3_3_4_30).

[^211]: 79:3 While the Soma is driven to the hall, the sacrificer has to hold on to it from behind.

[^212]: 79:4 ‘Asya râ<i>g</i>âna<i>h</i> sabhâgâ<i>h</i>;’—Soma seems to be compared here with an emperor or overlord of kings (adhirâ<i>g</i>o râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âm, V, 4,2,2), who is holding a royal court (ra<i>g</i>asabhâ), or a Darbar, to which the under-kings are flocking. Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to interpret the passage differently: apy asya râ<i>g</i>âna<i>h</i> iti sabhâgâ ity anena râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âm anatikrama<i>n</i>îyam p. 80 uktam bhavati; api sambhâvanâyâm madhuparkam âha ‘râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>e <i>k</i>â<i>k</i>ârya<i>s</i>va<i>s</i>urapit<i>ri</i>vyamâtulâna<i>m</i> <i>k</i>eti’ (Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>hyas. I, 24) sambhâvanîyânâm madhye râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âm prathamato nirdi<i>s</i>ena (!) <i>s</i>resh<i>th</i>yâvagamâd itarapû<i>g</i>yopalakshakatvenâpy asya râ<i>g</i>âna iti nirde<i>s</i>a iti mantavyam, râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a âgatân svayam prahva eva san pûrvas tebhya<i>h</i> prâg evâbhivadati vâgvyavahâra<i>m</i> karoti. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads: For he is his gracious lord, therefore he heeds not even a king; and yet (?) he is the first to salute the kings: thus he is indeed gracious to him: ‘esha vâ etasya bhadro bhavati, tasmâd esha na râ<i>g</i>âna<i>m</i> <i>k</i>anâdriyate ’tho pûrvo râ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>o ’bhivadati tathâsyaisha eva bhadro bhavati(!).’

[^213]: 80:1 Or, they can only shoot after his body, ‘<i>s</i>arîram evânvavahanti.’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has athâsyeda<i>m</i> <i>s</i>arîram evânasâ ’nvâvahanti,' i.e. ‘Now they only bring his body with the cart.’ The MS. of Sâya<i>n</i>a also has ‘anvâvahanti,’ but it explains it by ‘<i>s</i>yenîbhâvâd upâdeyasya sârâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>asya bâdhâbhâvâd dhantâ <i>s</i>arîram evânugatya hanti nâtmânam.’

[^214]: 81:1 This myth, according to which Indra was supposed to have assumed the form of a ram and to have carried off Medhâtithi, the Kâ<i>n</i>va (or, according to others, to have robbed him of his Soma), appears to be alluded to in Rig-veda VIII, 2, 40. On the possible connection of the myth with the Greek one of Ganymede, see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 40. Sâya<i>n</i>a does not explain the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ formula, but remarks, that he has already done so in the Sâma-brâhma<i>n</i>a (viz. in the Sha<i>d</i>vi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a).

[^215]: 81:2 According to Rig-veda I, 51, 13, Indra became the wife (menâ) of V<i>ri</i>sha<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>va (Mena); the reason for this transformation being, according to the Sha<i>d</i>vi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a Br., that he was in love with Menâ or Menakâ, the daughter of that king (or sage). Ind. Stud. I, p. 38. The later explanation of the simple statement of the <i>Ri</i>k seems of doubtful authenticity, unless the choice of the word menâ for ‘wife’ was intended by the bard as an allusion to the name of the king's daughter. It is more likely that the myth alluded to in the <i>Ri</i>k had been forgotten at the time of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and a new version of it was invented, based on the ‘menâ’ of the original. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 383, takes Menâ here as a name.

[^216]: 81:3 This is another of Indra's love-myths about which very little is known. Ahalyâ (Maitreyî) is said to have been the wife of the <i>Ri</i>shi Gautama (or of Kau<i>s</i>ika, according to Sha<i>d</i>v. Br.) and to have been loved by Indra.

[^217]: 82:1 According to Sâya<i>n</i>a on Rig-veda I, 10, 11 (where Indra is called Kau<i>s</i>ika, ‘favourable to the Ku<i>s</i>ikas’) Ku<i>s</i>ika desired to have a son equal to Indra, whence the latter was born as Ku<i>s</i>ika's son Gâthin (Gâdhin). Differently Sây. on Taitt. Âr. I, 12, 4.

[^218]: 82:2 The Sha<i>d</i>v. Br. (Ind. Stud. I, p. 38) explains this as follows:—The Gods and Asuras were at war with each other. Gotama was performing austerities between them. Indra went up to him and said, ‘Go out as our spy.’ ‘I cannot,’ he replied. ‘Then I will go in your form.’ ‘As thou thinkest fit!’ And because he (Indra) went about in the form of Gotama, passing himself off as Gotama, therefore he says, ‘thou who callest thee Gotama.’

[^219]: 82:3 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text also states that this last portion of the formula was devised by Âru<i>n</i>i, but nothing is said as to its use being optional.

[^220]: 82:4 For variations of this concluding part of the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ in different schools, see Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. I, 3, 3 seq.; also notes to [III, 9, 3, 10](Book_2_3_9#v3_9_3_10); IV, 9, 6, 25 (?); Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 383.

[^221]: 82:5 See [III, 1, 3, 1](Book_2_3_1#v3_1_3_1) seq.

[^222]: 83:1 ‘By this victim he redeems himself, the victim, and with that redeemed self, now his own, he sacrifices.’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^223]: 83:2 Skambha visar<i>g</i>anî (‘support or pin of the prop’) is taken by Sâya<i>n</i>a in the sense of ‘offshoot of the prop’ or ‘that which is let go (s<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>a) by the prop.’

[^224]: 83:3 I.e. belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a or is of Varu<i>n</i>a's nature (varu<i>n</i>yo p. 84 bhavati). Sâya<i>n</i>a (if the MS. is correct) takes it in the sense of ‘is Varu<i>n</i>a himself,’ etasmin krîtâvasare somo varu<i>n</i>o bhavati.

[^225]: 84:1 Or, ‘may the sacrifice encompass them all,’ if, with Grassmann and Ludwig, we read ‘ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>h</i>’ instead of ‘ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>am.’ This verse is likewise recited (? at the same time) by the Hot<i>ri</i>, see [p. 79](#p79), note [^209].
