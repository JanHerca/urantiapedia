### PREPARATION OF THE SOMA ALTAR WITH THE HIGH ALTAR [^290].

## FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_5_1_11"><sup><small>3:5:1:11.</small></sup></span>  From that post which is the largest on the east side (of the hall) [^291] he now strides three steps forwards (to the east), and there drives in a peg,—this is the intermediate (peg) [^292]. <span id="p112"><sup><small>[ p. 112 ]</small></sup></span> 3:5:1:22\. From that middle peg he strides fifteen steps to the right, and there drives in a peg,—this is the right hip.

<span id="v3_5_1_33"><sup><small>3:5:1:33.</small></sup></span>  From that middle peg he strides fifteen steps northwards, and there drives in a peg,—this is the left hip.

<span id="v3_5_1_44"><sup><small>3:5:1:44.</small></sup></span>  From that middle peg he strides thirty-six steps eastwards, and there drives in a peg,—this is the fore-part [^293].

<span id="v3_5_1_55"><sup><small>3:5:1:55.</small></sup></span>  From that middle peg (in front) he strides twelve steps to the right, and there drives in a peg, this is the right shoulder.

<span id="v3_5_1_66"><sup><small>3:5:1:66.</small></sup></span>  From that middle peg he strides twelve steps to the north, and there drives in a peg,—this is the left shoulder. This is the measure of the altar.

<span id="v3_5_1_77"><sup><small>3:5:1:77.</small></sup></span>  Now the reason why it is thirty steps broad behind is this: the Virâ<i>g</i> metre consists of thirty syllables, and by means of the Virâ<i>g</i> the gods obtained a firm footing in this world; and even so does he now, by means of the Virâ<i>g</i>, obtain a firm footing in this world.

<span id="v3_5_1_88"><sup><small>3:5:1:88.</small></sup></span>  But there may also be thirty-three (steps); for of thirty-three syllables also consists the Virâ<i>g</i>; and by means of the Virâ<i>g</i>, he obtains a firm footing in this world.

<span id="v3_5_1_99"><sup><small>3:5:1:99.</small></sup></span>  Then as to why the ‘easterly line [^294]’ is thirty-six steps long;—the B<i>ri</i>hatî consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the B<i>ri</i>hatî the gods obtained <span id="p113"><sup><small>[ p. 113 ]</small></sup></span> the heavenly world: and so does he now, by means of the B<i>ri</i>hatî, obtain the heavenly world and that offering-fire (Âhavanîya) of his is in the sky.

<span id="v3_5_1_1010"><sup><small>3:5:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  And as to (the altar) being twenty-four steps broad in front;—the Gâyatrî consists of twenty-four syllables, and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice: this is why it is twenty-four steps broad in front. This is the measure of the altar.

<span id="v3_5_1_1111"><sup><small>3:5:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  And why it is broader behind,—‘Wider behind, broad-hipped,’ thus they praise a woman. And by its being wider behind, he makes that womb at the hind-part (of the altar) wider, and from that wider womb these creatures are born.

<span id="v3_5_1_1212"><sup><small>3:5:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  That high altar (Uttaravedi [^295]) is the nose of the sacrifice; because they throw it up so as to be higher than the altar, therefore it is called ‘high altar.’

<span id="v3_5_1_1313"><sup><small>3:5:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  Now, in the beginning there were two kinds of beings here, the Âdityas and the Aṅgiras. The Aṅgiras then were the first to prepare a sacrifice, and having prepared the sacrifice they said to Agni, 'Announce thou to the Âdityas this our to-morrow's Soma-feast, saying, “Minister ye at this sacrifice of ours!”’

<span id="v3_5_1_1414"><sup><small>3:5:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  The Âdityas spake (to one another), ‘Contrive ye how the Aṅgiras shall minister unto us, and not we unto the Aṅgiras!’

<span id="v3_5_1_1515"><sup><small>3:5:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Verily by nothing but sacrifice is there a way out of this [^296]: let us undertake another <span id="p114"><sup><small>[ p. 114 ]</small></sup></span> Soma-feast!’ They brought together the (materials for) sacrifice, and having made ready the sacrifice, they said, ‘Agni, thou hast announced to us a Soma-feast for to-morrow; but we announce to thee and the Aṅgiras a Soma-feast even for to-day: it is for us that thou art (to officiate as) Hot<i>ri</i> [^297]!’

<span id="v3_5_1_1616"><sup><small>3:5:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  They sent back some other (messenger) to the Aṅgiras; but the Aṅgiras going after Agni, were exceeding angry with him, saying, ‘Going as our messenger, why didst thou not mind us [^298]?’

<span id="v3_5_1_1717"><sup><small>3:5:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  He spake, ‘The blameless chose me: as the chosen of the blameless, I could not go away.’ And let not therefore the chosen (priest) of a blameless man turn away from him. The Aṅgiras then officiated for the Âdityas in the sacrifice with Soma bought (krî) on the same day (sadyas); whence this Sadya<i>h</i>krî [^299].

<span id="v3_5_1_1818"><sup><small>3:5:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  They brought Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) to them for their sacrificial fee. They accepted her not, saying, ‘We shall be losers if we accept her.’ And so the performance of that sacrifice was not discharged (completed), as it was one requiring a sacrificial fee.

<span id="v3_5_1_1919"><sup><small>3:5:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon they brought Sûrya (the sun) to them, and they accepted him. Wherefore the Aṅgiras say, ‘Verily, we are fit for the sacrificial office, we are worthy to receive Dakshi<i>n</i>âs; yea, even he that burns yonder has been received by us [^300]!’ <span id="p115"><sup><small>[ p. 115 ]</small></sup></span> Hence a white horse is the sacrificial fee for the Sadya<i>h</i>krî.

<span id="v3_5_1_2020"><sup><small>3:5:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  On the front of this (horse) there is a golden ornament, whereby it is made an image of him that burns yonder.

<span id="v3_5_1_2121"><sup><small>3:5:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  Now Vâ<i>k</i> was angry with them: ‘In what respect, forsooth, is that one better than I,—wherefore is it, that they should have accepted him and not me [^301]?’ So saying she went away from them. Having become a lioness she went on seizing upon (everything [^302]) between those two contending parties, the gods and the Asuras. The gods called her to them, and so did the Asuras. Agni was the messenger of the gods, and one Saharakshas for the Asura-Rakshas.

<span id="v3_5_1_2222"><sup><small>3:5:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  Being willing to go over to the gods, she said, ‘What would be mine, if I were to come over to you?’—‘The offering shall reach thee even before (it reaches) Agni.’ She then said to the gods, ‘Whatsoever blessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!’ So she went over to the gods.

<span id="v3_5_1_2323"><sup><small>3:5:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  And, accordingly, when he pours ghee on the high altar [^303], while the fire is held (over it)—since the gods said to her on that occasion, ‘The offering shall reach thee even before Agni’—then that offering does reach her even before (it reaches) Agni; for this (high altar) is in reality Vâ<i>k</i>. And when he raises <span id="p116"><sup><small>[ p. 116 ]</small></sup></span> the high altar, it is for the completeness of the sacrifice, for the sacrifice is Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) and that (high altar) is Vâ<i>k</i>.

<span id="v3_5_1_2424"><sup><small>3:5:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  He measures it with the yoke and pin;—namely with the yoke (that place) whither they take (the earth); and with a yoke-pin that, from whence they take (the earth [^304]), for the team is harnessed with the yoke and the pin: it is because she (Vâ<i>k</i>), as a lioness, at that time roamed about unappeased that he thus yokes her here at the sacrifice.

<span id="v3_5_1_2525"><sup><small>3:5:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  One must not therefore accept a Dakshi<i>n</i>â (sacrificial fee) that has been refused (by another priest [^305]), for, having turned into a lioness, it destroys him;—nor must he (the sacrificer) take it home again, for, having turned into a lioness, it destroys him;—nor must he give it to any one else, as he would thereby make over the sacrifice to some one other than himself. Hence if he have any wretched kinsman, let him give it to him; for in that he gives it away, it will not turn into a lioness and destroy him; and in that he gives it to a kinsman, he does not make over (the sacrifice) to one other than himself: and this is the settling of a refused Dakshi<i>n</i>â.

<span id="v3_5_1_2626"><sup><small>3:5:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  He now takes the yoke-pin and the wooden sword; and from where the northern peg of the front side is, he strides three steps backwards and there marks off the pit (<i>k</i>âtvâla). The measure for the pit is the same (as for the high altar) [^306]; there <span id="p117"><sup><small>[ p. 117 ]</small></sup></span> is no (other) measure in regard to it: wherever he himself may think fit in his mind (to fix it), in front of the heap of rubbish (utkara), there let him mark off the pit.

<span id="v3_5_1_2727"><sup><small>3:5:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  From the (north) edge of the altar he lays down the pin from south to north, and draws the (western) outline, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 9), ‘Thou art for me the resort of the afflicted!’ Thereby he means this (earth), for it is thereon that he walks afflicted.

<span id="v3_5_1_2828"><sup><small>3:5:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he lays down the pin in front from south to north, and draws the outline with, ‘Thou art my wealth-resort.’ Thereby he means this (earth), for it is thereon that he walks having acquired (wealth).

<span id="v3_5_1_2929"><sup><small>3:5:1:2929.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down the pin along the (north) edge of the altar from west to east, and draws the outline with, ‘Preserve me from being in want [^307]!’ Thereby he means this (earth): ‘Wherever there is want, from that preserve me!’

<span id="v3_5_1_3030"><sup><small>3:5:1:3030.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down the pin on the north side from west to east, and draws the outline with, ‘Preserve me from being afflicted [^307]!’ Thereby he <span id="p118"><sup><small>[ p. 118 ]</small></sup></span> means this (earth): ‘wherever there is affliction, from that preserve me!’

<span id="v3_5_1_3131"><sup><small>3:5:1:3131.</small></sup></span>  He then flings (the wooden sword) [^308]; at the place where he flings [^309], the Agnîdh sits. He flings while mentioning the names of the Agnis [^310]. For those (three) Agnis whom the gods at first chose for the office of Hot<i>ri</i> passed away: they crept into these very earths,—namely, into this one and the two beyond it. It is really with this one [^311] that he now flings.

<span id="v3_5_1_3232"><sup><small>3:5:1:3232.</small></sup></span>  He flings with the texts, ‘May the Agni called Nabhas [^312] know (thee)! Go thou, O Agni, Aṅgiras, with the name of Âyu (life)!’ What life they passed away from [^313] that he bestows, that he re-animates. Having with, ‘Thou who art in this earth,’ taken (the loose soil dug up by the wooden sword), he puts it down (on the altar [^314]), with, ‘Whatever inviolate, holy name of thine, <span id="p119"><sup><small>[ p. 119 ]</small></sup></span> therewith I lay thee down!’ whereby he means to say, ‘whatever holy name, unviolated by the Rakshas, is thine, thereby I lay thee down [^315].’—With ‘Thee, moreover, for the delight of the gods,’ he takes (earth) a fourth time [^316]; whereby he means to say, ‘I take thee well-pleasing to the gods.’ He takes that (high altar) from a quadrangular pit, for there are four quarters: thus he takes it from all the four quarters.

<span id="v3_5_1_3333"><sup><small>3:5:1:3333.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he shifts (the earth) asunder, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 10), ‘Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies; be thou meet for the gods!’ Inasmuch as, on that occasion, she became a lioness and roamed about unappeased, therefore he says to her, ‘Thou art a lioness;’ and by ‘overcoming the enemies’ he means to say, ‘Through thee may we worst our enemies.’ ‘Be thou meet for the gods’ he says, because the high altar is a woman: her he thus renders meet for the gods.

<span id="v3_5_1_3434"><sup><small>3:5:1:3434.</small></sup></span>  He makes it on each side either of the size of the yoke, or ten feet of the sacrificer's [^317]; for the <span id="p120"><sup><small>[ p. 120 ]</small></sup></span> Virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten syllables, and the Virâ<i>g</i> is speech, and the sacrifice is speech. In the middle [^318] he makes, as it were, a navel, thinking, ‘Seated in one and the same place, I shall sprinkle (ghee) all round [^319].’

<span id="v3_5_1_3535"><sup><small>3:5:1:3535.</small></sup></span>  He sprinkles it with water: inasmuch as, on that occasion, she became a lioness and roamed about unappeased—water being (a means of) appeasement—he appeases her with water. And, the high altar being a woman, he thereby fits her for the gods: this is why he sprinkles it with water.

<span id="v3_5_1_3636"><sup><small>3:5:1:3636.</small></sup></span>  He sprinkles it with, ‘Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies: get thee pure for the gods!’ He then bestrews it with gravel. Now gravel certainly is an ornament, because gravel is rather shining. And that gravel being the ashes of Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, he is now about to place Agni thereon, and so Agni does not injure it: this is why he bestrews it with gravel. He bestrews it with, ‘Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies: array thee for the gods!’ He then covers it [^320], and thus covered it remains during that night.

### THE AGNI-PRA<i>N</i>AYANA, OR LEADING FORWARD OF THE FIRE [^321] TO THE HIGH ALTAR.

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_5_2_11"><sup><small>3:5:2:11.</small></sup></span>  They put fire-wood on (the Âhavanîya fire), and prepare the underlayer (of gravel [^322]). He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the Gârhapatya to melt), and cleans both the dipping-spoon and the offering-spoon. Having then clarified the ghee, he ladles five times thereof (into the offering-spoon). When the fire-wood is ablaze-

<span id="v3_5_2_22"><sup><small>3:5:2:22.</small></sup></span>  They lift the (burning) fire-wood, and place it on the underlayer [^323]. Thereupon he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite for Agni as he is taken forward [^324]!’ (and to the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>), ‘Come up after me with the single sword(-line)!’ The Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> goes up after him with the single sword(-line) as far <span id="p122"><sup><small>[ p. 122 ]</small></sup></span> as that middle peg on the hind-part of the altar [^325]: whatever part of the Gârhapatya [^326] is cut off from the altar by that intermediate (peg), that he thereby carries on to (connects with) it.

<span id="v3_5_2_33"><sup><small>3:5:2:33.</small></sup></span>  Now some walk up behind (and draw a line) as far as the high altar; but let him not do that: let him walk up only as far as that middle peg. They proceed and come up to the high altar [^327].

<span id="v3_5_2_44"><sup><small>3:5:2:44.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water. He first sprinkles (the high altar) in front, while standing (south of it) facing the north, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 11), 'May Indra's noise [^328] shield thee in front with the Vasus!' whereby he means to say, 'May Indra's noise protect thee in front with the Vasus.’

<span id="v3_5_2_55"><sup><small>3:5:2:55.</small></sup></span>  He then sprinkles it behind with, ‘May the Wise [^329] shield thee from behind with the Rudras!’ whereby he means to say, ‘May the Wise One protect thee from behind with the Rudras!’

<span id="v3_5_2_66"><sup><small>3:5:2:66.</small></sup></span>  He then sprinkles on the right (south) side with, ‘May the Thought-swift shield thee with the Fathers on the right!’ whereby he means <span id="p123"><sup><small>[ p. 123 ]</small></sup></span> to say, ‘May he swift as thought [^330] protect thee on the right with the Fathers!’

<span id="v3_5_2_77"><sup><small>3:5:2:77.</small></sup></span>  He then sprinkles on the left side with, ‘May Vi<i>s</i>vakarman (the All-shaper) shield thee with the Âdityas on the left!’ whereby he means to say, ‘May Vi<i>s</i>vakarman protect thee on the left with the Âdityas!’

<span id="v3_5_2_88"><sup><small>3:5:2:88.</small></sup></span>  The sprinkling-water which is left he pours outside the altar close to where is the southern of those two front corners (of the high altar) with, ‘This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice.’ Because she (Vâ<i>k</i>\—the altar) on that occasion became a lioness and roamed about unappeased [^331], he thus dismisses from the sacrifice that sorrow of hers,—if he do not wish to exorcise. But should he wish to exorcise, let him indicate it by saying, ‘This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice against so and so!’ He then smites him with that sorrow, and sorrowing he goes to yonder world.

<span id="v3_5_2_99"><sup><small>3:5:2:99.</small></sup></span>  Now as to why he pours ghee on the high altar, while the fire is held (over it). Because the gods said to her on that occasion, ‘The offering shall reach thee before Agni,’ therefore the offering now does reach her before (it reaches) Agni. And because she said to the gods, ‘Whatsoever blessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!’ therefore the priests now invoke through her that blessing upon the sacrificer, and it is fully accomplished unto him.

<span id="v3_5_2_1010"><sup><small>3:5:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  When he pours ghee on the high altar, he <span id="p124"><sup><small>[ p. 124 ]</small></sup></span> does it twofold even while doing it in one [^332]. Now that which is the southern of the two front corners of that navel, so to say, which is in the middle of these (sides of the high altar)—

<span id="v3_5_2_1111"><sup><small>3:5:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  On that [^333] he pours ghee, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 12), ‘Thou art a lioness; Hail!’ Then on the northern of the two back corners with, ‘Thou art a lioness, winning the Âdityas [^334], Hail!’ Then on the southern of the two back corners with, ‘Thou art a lioness, winning the Brahman, winning the Kshatra, Hail!’ Manifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the sacrificial texts: by this one he prays [^335] for the Brahman (priesthood) and the Kshatra. (nobility), those two vital forces.

<span id="v3_5_2_1212"><sup><small>3:5:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  Then on the northern of the front corners with, ‘Thou art a lioness, winning abundant offspring, winning growth of wealth, Hail!’ In that he says, ‘winning abundant offspring,’ he prays for offspring; and in that he says, ‘winning growth of wealth’—growth of wealth meaning abundance—he prays for abundance.

<span id="v3_5_2_1313"><sup><small>3:5:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then pours ghee into the middle with, ‘Thou art a lioness, bring thou hither the gods for the sacrificer! Hail!’ whereby he causes the gods to be brought to the sacrificer. He then raises the offering-spoon with, ‘To the <span id="p125"><sup><small>[ p. 125 ]</small></sup></span> beings thee! Hail!’—beings meaning offspring—he thereby means to say, ‘To offspring thee!’

<span id="v3_5_2_1414"><sup><small>3:5:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then lays the enclosing-sticks [^336] round (the navel); with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 13), ‘Thou art firm, steady thou the earth!’ the middle one; with, ‘Thou art firmly settled, steady thou the air!’ the right one; with, ‘Thou art immovably settled, steady thou the sky!’ the left one. With, 'Thou art Agni's provision' he throws the ‘equipments’ upon (the high altar). Wherefore are the equipments?—for Agni's completeness.

<span id="v3_5_2_1515"><sup><small>3:5:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  The pine-wood, namely, is his body [^337]: hence in that there are enclosing-sticks of pine-wood, thereby he supplies him with a body, makes him whole.

<span id="v3_5_2_1616"><sup><small>3:5:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  And the bdellium, forsooth, is his flesh: hence in that there is bdellium, thereby he supplies him with flesh, makes him whole.

<span id="v3_5_2_1717"><sup><small>3:5:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  And the fragrant reed-grass (sugandhi-te<i>g</i>ana), forsooth, is his fragrance: hence in that there is fragrant reed-grass, thereby he supplies him with fragrance, makes him whole.

<span id="v3_5_2_1818"><sup><small>3:5:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  And as to why there is a wether's hair-tuft,—Agni, forsooth, dwelt once for one night between the two horns of a wether: 'Whatever of Agni's nature is inherent therein, let that be here too,' so he thinks, and therefore there is a wether's hair-tuft. Let him, therefore, cut off that (tuft) which is nearest to the head, and bring it; and if he be unable to procure that, let him bring any kind (of wether's hair). And why there are enclosing-sticks?—for the <span id="p126"><sup><small>[ p. 126 ]</small></sup></span> protection (of Agni): for it is somewhat long before the next enclosing-sticks will come nigh to him [^338].


<span id="v3_5_3"><sup><small>3:5:3</small></sup></span>

### CONSTRUCTION OF SHEDS, AND PREPARATION OF PRESSING-PLACE AND HEARTHS (DHISH<i>N</i>YAS).

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_5_3_11"><sup><small>3:5:3:11.</small></sup></span>  The sacrifice is a man; it is a man for the reason that a man spreads (prepares) it. In being spread it is made just as large [^339] as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a man.

<span id="v3_5_3_22"><sup><small>3:5:3:22.</small></sup></span>  The Soma-cart (shed) is no other than his head, and has Vish<i>n</i>u for its deity [^340]. And because Soma is therein—Soma being havis (material for offering) for the gods—therefore it is called Havirdhâna (receptacle of havis).

<span id="v3_5_3_33"><sup><small>3:5:3:33.</small></sup></span>  The Âhavanîya is no other than his mouth: hence, when he offers on the Âhavanîya, it is as if he poured (food) into the mouth.

<span id="v3_5_3_44"><sup><small>3:5:3:44.</small></sup></span>  The sacrificial stake is no other than his crest-lock; and the Âgnîdhrîya and Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya [^341] are his arms. <span id="p127"><sup><small>[ p. 127 ]</small></sup></span> 3:5:3:55\. The Sadas [^342] (tent for the priests) is no other than his belly: wherefore they feed in the Sadas, for whatever food is eaten here on earth all that settles down here in the belly. And because all the gods sat (sad) in it therefore it is called Sadas: and so do these Brahmans of every family now sit therein.

<span id="v3_5_3_66"><sup><small>3:5:3:66.</small></sup></span>  And the two fires which are behind [^343] it are his feet. In being spread it is made just as large as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a man.

<span id="v3_5_3_77"><sup><small>3:5:3:77.</small></sup></span>  The cart-shed has doors on both sides; and so has the Sadas doors on both sides: hence this man is perforated from one end to the other. He steps to the Soma-carts when they have been -washed down.

<span id="v3_5_3_88"><sup><small>3:5:3:88.</small></sup></span>  They turn them round, the southern one on the south side, and the northern one on the north side [^344]. The larger of the two should be the southern (or right) one [^345].

<span id="v3_5_3_99"><sup><small>3:5:3:99.</small></sup></span>  Over them, having been turned round (and placed on the altar), they put a mat of reed-grass; or, if he cannot procure a reed-mat, a frame of split cane <span id="p128"><sup><small>[ p. 128 ]</small></sup></span> made in like manner as a reed-mat. They fasten a front-band (to the posts of the front door [^346]). They enclose (the carts) within two upright hurdles; and lay a (second) reed-mat, or a frame of split cane made in like manner as a reed-mat, behind (the first mat [^347]).

<span id="v3_5_3_1010"><sup><small>3:5:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  Now [^348], having again entered (the hall), and <span id="p129"><sup><small>[ p. 129 ]</small></sup></span> taken ghee in four ladlings, he makes offering to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion, for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) of the gods: ‘We will perform the sacrifice, for one impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>,’ thus (the priest thinks and) therefore he makes offering to Savit<i>ri</i>.

<span id="v3_5_3_1111"><sup><small>3:5:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  He offers with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 14; Rig-veda V, 81, 1), ‘They harness the mind and they harness the thoughts’—with the mind and with speech they truly perform the sacrifice. When he says, ‘They harness the mind,’ he harnesses the mind; and when he says, ‘and they harness the thoughts (dhî),’ he harnesses speech; for it is thereby [^349] that people seek to make their living in accordance with their respective intelligence (dhî), either by reciting (the Veda), or by readiness of speech, or by songs,—with these two thus harnessed they perform the sacrifice.

<span id="v3_5_3_1212"><sup><small>3:5:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘The priests of the priest, of the great inspirer of devotion,’—the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred writ, truly, are the priests: it is regarding them that he says this. And ‘of the great inspirer of devotion [^350],’—the great inspirer of devotion, truly, is the sacrifice: it is regarding the sacrifice that he says this. ‘The knower of rites alone hath assigned the priestly offices,’ for, in performing <span id="p130"><sup><small>[ p. 130 ]</small></sup></span> the sacrifice, they indeed assign the priestly offices. ‘Great is the praise of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>; Hail!’ Thus he offers to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion.

<span id="v3_5_3_1313"><sup><small>3:5:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  Having then taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, he walks out (of the hall by the front door). The (sacrificer's) wife is led out by the south door. He then lays down a piece of gold in the right wheel-track of the southern Sonia-cart, and offers thereon, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 15; Rig-veda I, 22, 17), ‘Vish<i>n</i>u strode through this(universe),thrice he put down his foot: it is enveloped in his dust; Hail!’ The residue (of ghee) he pours into the wife's hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle [^351] with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 17), ‘Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!’ He hands to his assistant both the offering-spoon and the melting-pot. They lead the wife round by the back of the two fires [^352].

<span id="v3_5_3_1414"><sup><small>3:5:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  Having taken ghee in four ladlings, the assistant lays down a piece of gold in the right wheel-track of the northern Soma-cart, and offers thereon, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 16; Rig-veda VII, 99, 3), ‘Be ye too abundant in food and milch kine and pastures, through benevolence to man! Thou proppedst asunder these two worlds, O Vish<i>n</i>u; with beams of light didst thou hold fast [^353] the earth on all sides; Hail!’ The residue (of ghee) he pours into the wife's hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle with, <span id="p131"><sup><small>[ p. 131 ]</small></sup></span> ‘Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!’ Then as to why he thus offers.

<span id="v3_5_3_1515"><sup><small>3:5:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas; and, the ghee being a thunderbolt, they kept off the evil spirits from the south by that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they came not after them on their way. And in like manner does he now keep off the evil spirits from the south by that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they do not come after him on his way. And the reason why he offers with two verses relating to Vish<i>n</i>u, is that the Soma-cart belongs to Vish<i>n</i>u.

<span id="v3_5_3_1616"><sup><small>3:5:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  And in that the wife anoints the burning (part) of the axle, thereby a productive union is effected; for when woman and man become heated, the seed flows, and thereupon birth takes place. She anoints in a direction away (from the cart), for away the seed is cast. He then says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite to the Soma-carts as they are wheeled forward [^354]!’

<span id="v3_5_3_1717"><sup><small>3:5:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  He makes (the sacrificer) say, ‘Go ye both forward, furthering the cult!’ The cult, namely, is the sacrifice: ‘go ye both forward, furthering the sacrifice’ he thereby means to say. ‘Convey ye the sacrifice upward; lead it not astray [^355]!’ whereby he means to say, ‘convey this sacrifice upward to the world of the gods;’ and by saying ‘lead it not astray,’ he prays for this (sacrificer) that he may not <span id="p132"><sup><small>[ p. 132 ]</small></sup></span> stumble. Let them wheel (the carts) forward, as it were lifting them, so that they may not creak; for of the Asuras is that voice which is in the axle [^356]: ‘Lest the Asuras’ voice should speak here!’ so he thinks. But if they should creak,—

<span id="v3_5_3_1818"><sup><small>3:5:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  Let him make (the sacrificer) say this, ‘Speak ye unto your own cow-pen, ye divine resorts; speak not my life away, speak not my offspring away!’ This, then, is the expiation thereof.

<span id="v3_5_3_1919"><sup><small>3:5:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘Let him stride three steps from the high altar westward and make the Soma-carts stop there: this is the measure for the Soma-carts.’ But there is no (fixed) measure in this; wherever he himself may think fit in his mind, only not too near [^357], nor too far (from the high altar), there let him stop them.

<span id="v3_5_3_2020"><sup><small>3:5:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  He salutes them with, ‘May ye rejoice here on the height of the earth!’ for this (altar) is verily the height [^358] (top) of the earth, since his offering-fire is in the heaven. He makes them rest on their naves [^359] for that is the appearance of repose. <span id="p133"><sup><small>[ p. 133 ]</small></sup></span> 3:5:3:2121\. The Adhvaryu, having gone round along the north side (of the carts), props the southern cart, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 18; Rig-veda I, 154, 1), ‘Now will I declare the heroic deeds of Vish<i>n</i>u, who measured out the earthly regions; who propped the upper seat, striding thrice, the wide-stepping! For Vish<i>n</i>u (I prop) thee!’ He fixes the prop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice [^360].

<span id="v3_5_3_2222"><sup><small>3:5:3:2222.</small></sup></span>  The assistant then props the northern cart, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 19), ‘Either from the heaven, O Vish<i>n</i>u, or from the earth, or from the great, wide airy region, O Vish<i>n</i>u, fill both thine hands with wealth and bestow on us from the right and the left! For Vish<i>n</i>u thee!’ He fixes the prop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice. The reason why he performs with prayers to Vish<i>n</i>u is that the Soma-cart belongs to Vish<i>n</i>u.

<span id="v3_5_3_2323"><sup><small>3:5:3:2323.</small></sup></span>  He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching the middle reed-mat [^361] (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 20; Rig-veda I, 154, 2), ‘Let Vish<i>n</i>u then be praised for his power, terrible like a wild beast prowling about the mountains, on whose three wide strides all beings abide!’ Now that (mat-covering) indeed is his (Vish<i>n</i>u, the shed's) upper skull-bone [^362] <span id="p134"><sup><small>[ p. 134 ]</small></sup></span> for thereon, as it were, the other skull-bones rest: this is why he says ‘they abide on.’

<span id="v3_5_3_2424"><sup><small>3:5:3:2424.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he makes him say, after touching the front-band (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 2), 'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's fillet;' for it indeed is his fillet. He then makes him say, after touching the two upright hurdles, 'Ye are the corners of Vish<i>n</i>u's mouth;' for they indeed are the corners of his mouth. Then that mat which is behind there, that indeed is that skull-bone of his here behind (viz. the occiput).

<span id="v3_5_3_2525"><sup><small>3:5:3:2525.</small></sup></span>  With 'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's sewer [^363],' he sews (the hurdles to the four door posts) with cord by means of a wooden pin. With, 'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's fixed (point) [^364],' he then makes a knot, ‘lest it should fall asunder.’ That same (knot) he undoes when the work is completed; and thus disease [^365] befalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. The completed (cart-shed) he touches with, 'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's own,' for the Soma-cart (and shed) belongs to Vish<i>n</i>u.

<span id="v3_5_4"><sup><small>3:5:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_5_4_11"><sup><small>3:5:4:11.</small></sup></span>  It is for a twofold reason that the sounding-holes are dug. The cart-shed, truly, is the head of the sacrificer; and what four holes there are here in the head—namely, these two and these two [^366]\—those he thereby makes: for this reason he digs the sounding-holes.

<span id="v3_5_4_22"><sup><small>3:5:4:22.</small></sup></span>  Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, were contending. The Asuras then by way of witchcraft buried charms [^367] within these worlds, thinking, ‘Peradventure we may thus overcome the gods.’

<span id="v3_5_4_33"><sup><small>3:5:4:33.</small></sup></span>  The gods then prevailed. By means of these (sounding-holes) they dug up those magic charms. Now, when a charm is dug up, it becomes inoperative and useless. And in like manner, if any malicious enemy buries here charms by way of witchcraft for this (sacrificer), does he thereby dig them up; this is why he digs sounding-holes. He digs just beneath the fore-part of the shafts of the southern cart.

<span id="v3_5_4_44"><sup><small>3:5:4:44.</small></sup></span>  He takes up the spade [^368], with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 22), <span id="p136"><sup><small>[ p. 136 ]</small></sup></span> ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, I take thee with the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, with the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman.’ The significance of this formula is the same (as before). That spade (abhri, fem.) is indeed a female: therefore he says ‘thou art a woman.’

<span id="v3_5_4_55"><sup><small>3:5:4:55.</small></sup></span>  He draws their outlines, saving [^369] the measure of a span, with, ‘Here do I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!’ For the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he thus cuts off the necks of the Rakshas.

<span id="v3_5_4_66"><sup><small>3:5:4:66.</small></sup></span>  Let him first mark off the right (southern) one of the two that are in front; then the left one of the two behind; then the right one of those behind; then the left one of those in front.

<span id="v3_5_4_77"><sup><small>3:5:4:77.</small></sup></span>  But they say conversely, that he should mark off first the left one of the two behind; then the right one of those in front; then the right one of those behind; and then the left one of those in front. Or he may also mark them off in one and the same direction [^370]: but let him, in any case, mark off last of all the one which is on the left of those in front.

<span id="v3_5_4_88"><sup><small>3:5:4:88.</small></sup></span>  He digs them, in the very same order in which they have been marked off, with, ‘Thou art great, <span id="p137"><sup><small>[ p. 137 ]</small></sup></span> of great sound!’—he praises and extols them, when he says, ‘Thou art great, of great sound;’—‘Utter thou the great voice unto Indra!’—Indra, forsooth, is the deity of the sacrifice; and the cart-shed belonging to Vish<i>n</i>u, he thereby makes it to be connected with Indra: therefore he says, ‘Utter thou the great voice unto Indra!’

<span id="v3_5_4_99"><sup><small>3:5:4:99.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Rakshas-killing, charm-killing (voice),’ for it is indeed for the killing of the charms of the Rakshas that these (holes) are dug;—‘Of Vish<i>n</i>u;’ for that voice in the cart-shed is indeed Vish<i>n</i>u's.

<span id="v3_5_4_1010"><sup><small>3:5:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  He throws out (the earth from) them in the order in which he has dug them, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 23), ‘Here do I cast out the charm which the alien, which the inmate of my house has buried for me!’ Either an alien or an inmate of his house buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.

<span id="v3_5_4_1111"><sup><small>3:5:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  ‘Here do I cast out the charm which my equal, which my unequal has buried for me!’ Either one equal, or one unequal, to him buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.

<span id="v3_5_4_1212"><sup><small>3:5:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘Here do I cast out the charm which the kinsman, which the stranger has buried for me!’ Either a kinsman or a stranger buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.

<span id="v3_5_4_1313"><sup><small>3:5:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  ‘Here do I cast out the charm which the countryman, which the foreigner has buried for me!’ Either a countryman or a foreigner buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out. With ‘I cast out witchcraft!’ he finally <span id="p138"><sup><small>[ p. 138 ]</small></sup></span> throws out (the earth remaining in the several holes [^371]), whereby he casts out witchcraft.

<span id="v3_5_4_1414"><sup><small>3:5:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  Let him dig them arm-deep; for that being the end (extreme limit to which he can reach) he thereby in the end brings witchcraft to naught. He connects them crossways by (underground) channels [^372]; or, if he cannot crossways, he may do so in one and the same direction. This is why these (openings of the) vital airs are connected by channels farther (inside).

<span id="v3_5_4_1515"><sup><small>3:5:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  In the same order in which he has dug them he makes (the sacrificer) touch them, with the texts (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 24), ‘Self-ruling thou art, a slayer of enemies! Ever-ruling thou art, a slayer of haters! Man-ruling thou art, a slayer of Rakshas! All-ruling thou art, a slayer of foe-men!’ This is the blessing of that work: he thereby invokes a blessing.

<span id="v3_5_4_1616"><sup><small>3:5:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu and Sacrificer then touch one another (with their right hands through the holes), the Adhvaryu is at the right one of those in front, and the Sacrificer at the left one of those behind. The Adhvaryu asks, ‘Sacrificer, what is here?’—‘Happiness!’ he says.—‘(Be) that ours in common!’ says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.

<span id="v3_5_4_1717"><sup><small>3:5:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the Adhvaryu is at the right one of those behind, and the Sacrificer at the left one of those in front. The Sacrificer asks, ‘Adhvaryu, what is here?’—‘Happiness!’ he says.—‘(Be) that mine!’ says the Sacrificer. Now in that they thus <span id="p139"><sup><small>[ p. 139 ]</small></sup></span> touch one another, thereby they make the vital airs yoke-fellows: hence these vital airs meet together farther (inside). And in that, when asked, he replies, ‘Happiness (bhadram),’ thereby he utters the wish of ‘prosperity (kalyâ<i>n</i>am)’ of ordinary speech: that is why, being asked, he replies, ‘Happiness.’ Thereupon he sprinkles (the holes with water): one and the same forsooth is the significance of sprinkling; he thereby renders them pure.

<span id="v3_5_4_1818"><sup><small>3:5:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  He sprinkles, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 25), ‘You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers;’ for they are indeed Rakshas-killers as well as charm-killers; 'Vish<i>n</i>u's own, I sprinkle;' for they indeed belong to Vish<i>n</i>u.

<span id="v3_5_4_1919"><sup><small>3:5:4:1919.</small></sup></span>  What remains of the sprinkling-water he then pours out into the pits;—what moisture there is here in the vital airs [^373], that he thereby puts into them: hence that moisture in the vital airs.

<span id="v3_5_4_2020"><sup><small>3:5:4:2020.</small></sup></span>  He pours it out with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vish<i>n</i>u's own, I pour out.' Thereupon he spreads barhis-grass, both such as is turned with its tops to the east and such as is turned to the north [^374]; what hair there is here at (the openings of) the vital airs, that he thereby bestows: hence that hair at (the openings of) the vital airs.

<span id="v3_5_4_2121"><sup><small>3:5:4:2121.</small></sup></span>  He spreads it with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vish<i>n</i>u's own, I spread.' He, as it were, covers the bodies on the top, for that (grass) is indeed his (Vish<i>n</i>u's) hair [^375]. <span id="p140"><sup><small>[ p. 140 ]</small></sup></span> 3:5:4:2222\. Thereon he lays two pressing-boards [^376] with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vish<i>n</i>u's own, I lay down;' they are indeed his (Vish<i>n</i>u's) jaws. He surrounds them (with earth) with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vish<i>n</i>u's own, I surround;' he thereby steadies them, makes them immovable.

<span id="v3_5_4_2323"><sup><small>3:5:4:2323.</small></sup></span>  Now the pressing-skin is cut straight all round and (dyed) red all over, for it is his (Vish<i>n</i>u's) tongue: the reason, then, why it is quite red, is because this tongue is, as it were, red. He lays it down with, 'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's own;' for it indeed belongs to Vish<i>n</i>u [^377].

<span id="v3_5_4_2424"><sup><small>3:5:4:2424.</small></sup></span>  He then brings down the (five) press-stones. The press-stones, doubtless, are his (Vish<i>n</i>u's) teeth: hence, when they press (the Soma) with the stones it is as if he chewed with his teeth. He puts them down with, 'Ye are Vish<i>n</i>u's own;' for they indeed belong to Vish<i>n</i>u. Thus, then, the head of the sacrifice is complete.

## Footnotes

[^291]: 111:2 The preparation of the special altars—viz. the large Soma altar (mahâ-vedi, or saumikî-vedi) and the ‘high altar’ (uttara-vedi) on the former—takes place on the last but one Upasad day, after the morning performance of the Upasads.

[^292]: 111:3 This post stands in the middle of the east door of the hall or Prâ<i>k</i>îna-va<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, just in front of the Âhavanîya-fire. See [p. 3](../Book_2_3_1#p3), note [2](../Book_2_3_1#fn27).

[^293]: 111:4 Anta<i>h</i>pâta, lit. ‘falling within or between,’ because it stands p. 112 between the (new) altar and the Prâ<i>k</i>îna-va<i>m</i><i>s</i>a fires and altar. See III, 5, 2, 2.

[^294]: 112:1 That is, the middle of the front side of the altar, or, as it were, its head, where the ‘high altar’ is to be raised.

[^295]: 112:2 The ‘prâ<i>k</i>î’ is the line drawn from the middle of the west side to that of the front side of the altar, forming as it were the spine (p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>yâ) of the altar.

[^296]: 113:1 On the uttara-vedi (lit. ‘higher, upper altar’), now about to be raised on the fore-part of the great altar (mahâ-vedi or saumikî vedi) described in the preceding paragraphs, see also part i, p. 392 note.

[^297]: 113:2 The Kâ<i>n</i>va MS. reads, nâpakrama<i>n</i>am astv iti, which, if correct, p. 114 would mean, ‘Let there be no going away!’ i.e. ‘Let us not go (to the Aṅgiras)!’ or perhaps, ‘Do not thou (Agni) go away!’

[^298]: 114:1 Teshâ<i>m</i> nas tva<i>m</i> hotâsîti, perhaps ‘thou wilt sacrifice for us.’

[^299]: 114:2 ‘Sent by us, why didst thou not return?’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^300]: 114:3 An ekâha (one day's) performance of the Soma-sacrifice at which the consecrations, buying and pressing of Soma, are compressed into one day.

[^301]: 114:4 Api vâ asmâbhir esha pratig<i>ri</i>hîta<i>h</i>, ‘Ist doch jener von uns empfangen worden.’

[^302]: 115:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, Na mad esha kena <i>k</i>ana <i>s</i>reyan iti na bandhunâ na kena <i>k</i>ana katham eta<i>m</i> prag_ri<i>h</i>n_îyur na mâm iti; ‘That one is not my superior by anything, not by kinship, not by anything, why should they accept him and not me?’

[^303]: 115:2 Âdadânâ <i>k</i>a<i>k</i>âra = <i>g</i>ighatsayâ samîpastha<i>m</i> sarva<i>m</i> svîkurvatî, Sây.

[^304]: 115:3 See [III](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_2_9), 5, 2, 9-[11](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_2_11).

[^305]: 116:1 That is to say, the pit (<i>k</i>âtvâla) whence the earth for the high altar is taken is measured with the yoke-pin, and the high altar with the yoke. Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to take it differently: Yatra yasmin de<i>s</i>e yugena haranti yato yasmât tatra <i>s</i>amyayâpi haranti.

[^306]: 116:2 Or perhaps, one must not take back a Dakshi<i>n</i>â, refused by a priest.

[^307]: 116:3 The earth taken from the pit being used for constructing the p. 117 high altar, both are of the same size or cubic content. The pit is to measure thirty-two aṅgulas (about two feet) on each side. As to the exact distance of the pit from the north-east peg, this is to be left to the discretion of the Adhvaryu, provided it be in front of the utkara, or heap of rubbish formed in making the large altar (on which the high altar is raised), and a passage be left between the utkara and the pit. The latter is contiguous to the north edge of the large altar. As described in the succeeding paragraphs, the west side is marked off first (by drawing the wooden sword along the inner side of the yoke-pin), then successively the front, the south, and the north sides.

[^309]: 117:1 For ‘nâthitât’ and ‘vyathitât,’ the Kâ<i>n</i>va text, as the Taitt. S. VI, 2, 7, 2, has the readings ‘nâthitam’ and ‘vyathitam.’

[^310]: 118:1 Compare the Stambaya<i>g</i>ur-hara<i>n</i>am (which has also to be performed on the present occasion, in preparing the large altar), I, 2, 4, 8 seq.

[^311]: 118:2 That is, at the place where the uttaravedi is to be raised, whence the Adhvaryu throws the sphya to where the pit is to be dug. While he throws (or thrusts in) the wooden sword, the sacrificer has to take hold of him from behind.

[^312]: 118:3 See I, 2, 3, 1.

[^313]: 118:4 I.e. with the Agni who entered into this earth.

[^314]: 118:5 Apparently ‘vapour, welkin.’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va rec. reads, 'Mayest thou know Agni's name Nabhas' (Vider Agner, &c.). The Taitt. S., on the other hand, reads ‘vider Agnir nabho nâma,’ which Sâya<i>n</i>a explains by ‘the Agni of the vedi (!) is Nabhas by name.’

[^315]: 118:6 Yat prâdhanva<i>m</i>s tad âyur dadhâti. Perhaps we ought to read with the Kâ<i>n</i>va text, Vat prâdhanvat tad asminn âyur dadhâti tad ena<i>m</i> samîrayati, ‘the life which passed away (?), that he bestows on him, therewith he re-animates him.’

[^316]: 118:7 He throws it on the fore-part of the altar, close to the peg marking the middle of the front side, where the ‘high altar’ is to be raised on it.

[^317]: 119:1 He repeats the same ceremony a second and a third time with the same texts, except that, instead of ‘Thou who art in this earth,’ he says, ‘Thou who art in the second (third) earth.’

[^318]: 119:2 He takes with the spade as much as is required to make the high altar of the proper size.

[^319]: 119:3 This statement seems to have greatly puzzled the later ritualists, as Kâty. V, 3, 32-35 and the comments thereon show. In rule 32 it is laid down, in accordance with [paragraph 26](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_1_26) above, that the Adhvaryu is to make the high altar of the size of the yoke-pin and the pit, i.e. about two feet square. The next rule then leaves an option between four other measurements, viz. he may make it either one third of the area of the large altar, or of unlimited size, or of the size of the yoke (86 aṅgulas = c. 5-5½ feet) or of ten of the sacrificer's feet. This latter measurement is explained rather ingeniously by Harisvâmin, as meaning that the high altar is to form p. 120 an oblong of three feet by one foot, when, in counting the number of sides of the three squares thus obtained, we obtain ten sides of one foot each. However, the repetition of ‘da<i>s</i>a’ in our text—which can only mean ‘ten feet on each side’—does not favour this explanation, The last two alternatives, according to rules 34-35, only apply to the Soma-sacrifice, because otherwise the altar (as in the case of the ‘northern altar’ at the <i>K</i>âturmâsya, cf. part i, p. 392) would not be large enough to contain a ‘high altar’ of that size.

[^320]: 120:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text wants it to be made at the back (<i>g</i>aghanena).

[^321]: 120:2 When he makes the libation of ghee on the high altar (III, 5, 2, 9-14 he pours it on the four corners of the ‘navel’ and thereby, as it were, on the whole ‘high altar.’

[^322]: 120:3 Viz. with branches of udumbara or plaksha (see III, 8, 3, 10), or with darbha grass.

[^323]: 121:1 The transferring of the Âhavanîya fire to the high altar takes place in the forenoon of the last Upasad day (that is, on the day preceding the pressing day, and called upavasatha, or preparation day). It is preceded by the double or combined performance of the Upasad offerings (one of which took place in the afternoon on the two preceding days).

[^324]: 121:2 Some gravel is put in a pan for the burning wood to lie upon, when it is to be transferred from the Âhavanîya to the new altar. The Taittirîyas mix with the gravel one-fourth part of the dust of the foot-print of the Soma-cow ([III, 3, 1, 6](../Book_2_3_3#v3_3_1_6)), the other three parts being used respectively for anointing the axle of the Soma-cart ([III, 5, 3, 13](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_3_13)), for the underlayer of the Âgnîdhra fire ([III, 6, 3, 4](../Book_2_3_6#v3_6_3_4)), and for scattering about behind the Gârhapatya ([III, 6, 3, 4](../Book_2_3_6#v3_6_3_4)\-[7](../Book_2_3_6#v3_6_3_7)).

[^325]: 121:3 Lit. they lift the underlayer underneath (the burning wood).

[^326]: 121:4 For the eight verses (or twelve, the first and last being recited thrice each) which the Hot<i>ri</i> has to repeat while the fire is carried eastward and laid down on the high altar, see Ait. Br. I, 28; Â<i>s</i>v. Sr. II, 17. For the Brahman's duties, see Kâty. XI, 1, 9.

[^327]: 122:1 See [III, 5, 1, 1](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_1_1).

[^328]: 122:2 The Âhavanîya or offering fire being now transferred to the new altar, the old Âhavanîya hearth is henceforward used as Gârhapatya; and a line is drawn from it up to the anta<i>h</i>pâta, marking the middle of the west side of the great altar.

[^329]: 122:3 In ‘leading forwards’ the fire they proceed along the north side of the large altar.

[^330]: 122:4 Indraghoshá, perhaps 'India's name;' Mahîdhara and Sâya<i>n</i>a take it as ‘he who is noised abroad as Indra’ (i.e. called Indra), which, however, would require the accent ‘índraghosha.’ Perhaps ‘the noise of Indra’ means Agni, the roaring fire: for Agni and the Vasus, see [III, 4, 2, 1](../Book_2_3_4#v3_4_2_1).

[^331]: 122:5 Pra<i>k</i>etas, here Varu<i>n</i>a according to Mahîdhara and Sâya<i>n</i>a. Cf. [III, 4, 2, 1](../Book_2_3_4#v3_4_2_1).

[^332]: 123:1 ‘Mano<i>g</i>avas’ is taken by Mahîdhara and Sâya<i>n</i>a as referring to Yama.

[^333]: 123:2 ‘<i>S</i>o<i>k</i>antî (sorrowing),’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^334]: 124:1 Viz. by pouring the ghee cross-wise on the corners of the ‘navel’ of the altar.

[^335]: 124:2 The south-east is sacred to Agni, the north-west to Vâyu.

[^336]: 124:3 Because the Âdityas brought her as a Dakshi<i>n</i>â, Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.; cf. [III, 5, 1, 18](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_1_18).

[^337]: 124:4 But for the lack of a demonstrative pronoun with â<i>s</i>î<i>h</i> one would like to take the passage thus: ‘Plenteous, forsooth, is this prayer for blessing among sacrificial texts: he thereby prays for the priesthood and the nobility.’ Cf. I, 2, 1, 7.

[^338]: 125:1 They are of pîtudâru (Pinus Deodora) wood, a span (of thumb and fore-finger) long.

[^339]: 125:2 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text makes it his bones.

[^340]: 126:1 Ordinarily the laying round of the paridhis takes place immediately before the fire is kindled for the offering; but as the next offering is not to come off for some time, the fire would be without a protection, if he were to leave it without the enclosing-sticks. Sâya<i>n</i>a takes ‘dûre’ in the sense of ‘in a long time,’ as above; but it might be taken of space ‘far off,’ when the passage would refer to the offering about to be performed on the old Âhavanîya ([III, 5, 3, 10](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_3_10) seq.); and it may be noticed in reference to this point, that, according to Kâty. VIII, 3, 30, that fire does not become the Gârhapatya till immediately after that offering.

[^341]: 126:2 Yâvat-tâvat would rather seem to mean here ‘of corresponding (or relatively the same) proportions’ as a man, viz. as the respective sacrificer. ‘Sa vai tâyamâno yâvân eva purushas tâvân vidhîyate, purushasyaiva vidhâm anu.’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^342]: 126:3 Soma himself is Vish<i>n</i>u.

[^343]: 126:4 See [III, 6, 1, 23](../Book_2_3_6#v3_6_1_23); [2, 21](../Book_2_3_6#v3_6_2_21).

[^344]: 127:1 See [III, 6, 2, 21](../Book_2_3_6#v3_6_2_21).

[^345]: 127:2 That is, the (old) Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya fires of the Prâ<i>k</i>îna-va<i>m</i><i>s</i>a.

[^346]: 127:3 The southern (and larger) cart is under the charge of the Adhvaryu and the northern one under that of his assistant, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>. Each now drives his cart westward along the south and north sides respectively; and when they are opposite the hall (<i>s</i>âla), they make the carts turn round from left to right; whereupon they drive back to the altar, and place them thereon with the shafts towards the east, near the anta<i>h</i>pâta (‘intermediate’ peg, see [III, 5, 1, 1](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_1_1)), south and north of the ‘spine’ (cf. [p. 112](../Book_2_3_5#p112), note [2](../Book_2_3_5#fn294)), each at the distance of one cubit from the latter.

[^347]: 127:4 In order to make the shed incline towards the north, cf. [III, 1, 1, 2](../Book_2_3_1#v3_1_1_2).

[^348]: 128:1 It is not clear to me whether the arrangements mentioned in this paragraph refer to the carts in the first place, and have then to be repeated after the shed has been erected, or whether, as I think, some of them refer to the shed only. Even at the time of the Kâty. Sûtras there seems to have been some confusion in this respect, and the rules VIII, 4, 7-12 (10-15, in edition) were entirely misunderstood by the commentator. It is, however, certain that the carts were covered with mats, previously to being shifted from the back to the front part of the altar. As regards the shed, it seems to have been constructed in the following way. In front of the carts, as well as behind them, beams are driven into the ground, six on each side, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a on T. S. I, 2, 13; the two middle ones, one cubit north and south of the ‘spine’ respectively, forming a gateway on each side (Kâty. VIII, 4, 24 scholl.). On these two rows of beams other beams are laid, running from south to north, and forming, as it were, the lintels of the gates; and thereon the tie-beams rest (west to east). This frame of timber is to form a square of nine (or ten) cubits. Over the tie-beams three mats of reed-grass(<i>k</i>adis)—measuring nine (or ten) cubits by three (3½)—are spread, from south to north; first the middle one and then the two others, behind and in front of it. Upright hurdles (or reed-mats) are then stretched between the respective corner-posts, so as to form the south and north sides of the shed; and are ‘sewn’ to the corner-posts. Between the tops of the two front door-posts a band or garland of plaited reed-tufts (or, according to Haug, a bunch of Darbha grass, consisting of dry and green stalks) is hung up, to represent either a fillet or wreath worn on the forehead (?), or as a door-garland.

[^349]: 128:2 This remark would seem to imply that there are only two mats (cf. parags. [23](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_3_23), [24](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_3_24)), but perhaps it is merely intended to show that two mats are spread behind and in front of the first mat (i.e. from south to north, and not west to east); not that there are only two mats.

[^350]: 128:3 If the preceding paragraph refers (at least partly) to the shed, p. 129 then the atha here means ‘Now, in the first place,’ thereby introducing details preliminary to what has just been stated.

[^351]: 129:1 See [III, 2, 4, 16](../Book_2_3_2#v3_2_4_16). I now refer ‘etayâ’ to ‘vâ<i>k</i>am,’ as does Sâya<i>n</i>a,—yadâ buddhir <i>g</i>âyate tadâ khalv etayâ vâ<i>k</i>â <i>g</i>u<i>g</i>yûshanti. He explains ‘prakâmodya’ by ‘mlai<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ika<i>m</i> laukikam bhâsha<i>n</i>am,’ barbarous, worldly speech.

[^352]: 129:2 Vipa<i>s</i><i>k</i>it, probably ‘thinker of hymns.’ It remains doubtful what meaning our author assigned to the word. Mahîdhara explains it by sarva<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, ‘all-knowing.’ Sâya<i>n</i>a, on Taitt. S. I, 2, 13, refers ‘viprasya b<i>ri</i>hato vipa<i>s</i><i>k</i>itah’ to the sacrificer.

[^353]: 130:1 That is, the iron pins driven into the axle, round which the naves of the wheels revolve. See also [p. 121](../Book_2_3_5#p121), note [2](../Book_2_3_5#fn322).

[^354]: 130:2 They make her enter the hall by the south door and walk round by the back of the (old) Gârhapatya fire-place to the wheel-tracks on the north side where the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> is about to offer.

[^355]: 130:3 The rays of the sun are apparently likened to ropes wherewith he keeps the earth straight and firm.

[^356]: 131:1 While reciting his hymn of eight verses (brought up, as usual, to twelve by repetitions of the first and last verses) the Hot<i>ri</i> has to follow the carts so as to have the north wheel-track of the south cart between his feet. Cf. [p. 79](../Book_2_3_3#p79), note [1](../Book_2_3_3#fn208). For the verses recited by him, see Ait. Br. I, 29; Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. IV, 9.

[^357]: 131:2 Or, ‘falter not!’

[^358]: 132:1 The Taitt. S. VI, 2, 9 refers it to Varu<i>n</i>a, on account of the axle being bound firmly with strings (thongs), resembling Varu<i>n</i>a's noose.

[^359]: 132:2 Rather, ‘not so very near,’ ‘nicht allzu nahe, nicht gar zu nahe.’

[^360]: 132:3 Both here, and on Taitt. S. I, 2, 13, Sâya<i>n</i>a takes ‘varshman’ in the sense of body (<i>s</i>arîra).’

[^361]: 132:4 Or rather, ‘nave-boards (nabhya).’ The cart wheels are described as consisting, after the fashion prevalent in Malaya (Kâty. VIII, 4, 5 scholl.), of three parallel boards: the two outer ones form segments, and the middle and largest one has the nave fixed to it, the axle-pin running through its centre. It is on this middle board that he is to make the carts stand. Perhaps ‘kshema’ should be taken in the sense of ‘security, firm position,’ instead of repose, rest,' in which case the upright position of the middle board would seem to be compared with a man in upright position; ‘nâbhi (nâbhya)’ meaning both ‘navel’ and ‘nave.’

[^362]: 133:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a, on Taitt. S. I, 2, 13, remarks:—‘The southern and northern parts of the yoke represent the ears of the cart. Through a hole (is effected) the firm tying (of the yoke parts) to the shafts. At the juncture (sandhi) at the (place of) fastening of the southern (part of the yoke) the prop is fixed.’ In ordinary practice the prop is put up to support the extreme end of the shafts or pole.

[^363]: 133:2 See [p. 128](#p128), note [^346].

[^364]: 133:3 Apparently the parietal bone is meant; or perhaps the frontal bone. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads: ‘He then touches that reed-mat, or p. 134 cane-frame, above, with “Let Vish<i>n</i>u . . .” for that is for him (Vish<i>n</i>u, the shed) what that skull-bone is up here. And when he says “they abide upon,” it is because that rest on the other skull-bones \[? adhi hy etad anyeshu kapâleshu kshiyanti!\]. Then what two reed-mats there are on the two carts, they indeed are for him what the two skull-bones are here on both sides. And that reed-mat, or cane-frame, which he puts on there behind (or behind that one), that is for him what the skull-bone behind is.’

[^365]: 134:1 Syû, explained by Sâya<i>n</i>a as ‘thread, cord,’ by Mahîdhara as ‘needle.’

[^366]: 134:2 ? Dhruva<i>h</i>, the ‘firm one,’ (? ‘pole-star.’) The St. Petersburg Dictionary gives the tentative meaning ‘knot.’ The Taitt. S. reads ‘dhruvam.’

[^367]: 134:3 Grâha, lit. ‘seizing.’ For Varu<i>n</i>a, whose attribute the knot is, (I, 3, 1, 16), seizing upon men by means of disease; see II, 5, 2, 2.

[^368]: 135:1 Viz. the ears and nostrils.

[^369]: 135:2 K<i>ri</i>tyâm valagân ni<i>k</i>akhnu<i>h</i>, ‘they dug in, as a charm, secret (magic) objects.’ Valaga is explained as charms, consisting of bones, nails, hair, foot-dust, and similar objects, tied up in a piece of worn matting or cloth, or the like, and dug into the ground arm-deep, for causing injury to enemies. See Taitt. S. VI, 2, 11, where Professor Weber refers to Wuttke, Der Deutsche Volksaberglaube, §492 seq.

[^370]: 135:3 The instrument used seems to be a kind of scoop or trowel, p. 136 sharpened on one side. For a fuller description, see VI, 3, 1, 30 seq.

[^371]: 136:1 Vinâ, i.e. leaving that space between each two adjoining uparavas. They are themselves to be round, a span in diameter. Hence by connecting the four centres by lines, a square of two spans (of thumb and forefinger), or one cubit, is obtained. See Baudh. <i>S</i>ulvas. 101.

[^372]: 136:2 That is, successively the south-eastern, the south-western, the north-western, and last, the north-eastern hole.

[^373]: 138:1 That is, these words are to be pronounced at the end of each of the preceding four formulas, and the remaining loose soil is therewith to be removed from the respective hole.

[^374]: 138:2 Lit. he inter-perforates, inter-channels.

[^375]: 139:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has <i>k</i>idra (‘holes, openings’) instead of prâ<i>n</i>a.

[^376]: 139:2 Cp. I, 3, 3, 7 seq.

[^377]: 139:3 Or, the hair of the sacrificial man; see [III, 5, 3, 1](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_3_1) seq.

[^378]: 140:1 The pressing-boards are a cubit long, and somewhat broader behind than in front. They are placed one south of the other, and so as to lie close together behind (sambaddhânte, Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.), or the space of two inches between them. The space between them is filled up with earth.

[^379]: 140:2 East of the ‘sound-holes’ he raises a square mound (khara), covered with gravel, for placing vessels on, Kâty. VIII, 5, 28.
