## SEVENTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v8_7_1_11"><sup><small>8:7:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He lays down two Ritavyâ (seasonal bricks). The seasonal (bricks) are the same as these seasons: it is the seasons he thereby lays down. And, indeed, the seasonal ones are everything here, for the seasonal ones are the year, and the year is everything here: he thus lays down everything here. And generative power they also are,—for the seasonal ones are the year, and the year means generative power: it is generative power he thus lays down (or bestows on Agni and the Sacrificer).

<span id="v8_7_1_22"><sup><small>8:7:1:22.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down seasonal (bricks),—the seasonal (ones) are the nobility and these other bricks are the peasantry: he thus places the nobility as the eater among the peasantry. He lays down (some of) them in all the layers: he thus places the nobility as the eater among the whole people [^226].

<span id="v8_7_1_33"><sup><small>8:7:1:33.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down seasonal (bricks),—this fire-altar is the year, and it is joined together by means of the seasonal (bricks): he thus makes the year continuous, and joins it together, by means of the seasons. These (formulas of the seasonal bricks) begin in a different way, but end in the same way; for the seasons were created, and, when created, they were different.

<span id="v8_7_1_44"><sup><small>8:7:1:44.</small></sup></span>  They spake, ‘While being thus, we shall not be <span id="p126">[<sup><small>p. 126</small></sup>]</span> able to procreate: let us unite with our forms!’ They united in each single season with their forms, whence there is in each single season the form of all the seasons. As to their (formulas) beginning in a different way, it is because they were created different (or separately); and as to their ending in the same way, it is because they united with their forms.

<span id="v8_7_1_55"><sup><small>8:7:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He lays them down, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 57), ‘Tapa and Tapasya, the two dewy seasons,’—these are the names of these two: it is thus by their names that he lays them down. Tapa (the burner), doubtless, is yonder sun: from him these two seasons are not separated; and inasmuch as these two seasons are not separated from him, they are called Tapa and Tapasya.

<span id="v8_7_1_66"><sup><small>8:7:1:66.</small></sup></span>  'Agni's coupling-link thou art,'—this fire-altar is the year, and it is joined together by means of the seasonal (bricks): he thus makes the year continuous, and joins it together by means of the seasons;—‘May Heaven and earth fit into one another! may the waters and plants fit into each other!’—he thereby makes everything here [^227] to fit in by means of the seasons:—‘May the fires fit into one another, each singly, working harmoniously together for my supremacy!’—for these single bricks are the same as those fires: he thus says this so that they may fit in with each other for the supremacy of those two seasons:—‘whatever fires there are, at one with each other, within these two, Heaven and Earth;’—as the text is, so is its meaning;—‘let them draw <span id="p127">[<sup><small>p. 127</small></sup>]</span> together, fitting in with the two dewy seasons, even as the gods draw together unto Indra;’—that is, ‘even as the gods are drawing together round Indra, so may they draw together for supremacy round these two seasons.’ Two bricks there are, because the season consists of two months. Only once he ‘settles’ them: he thereby makes the season to be one.

<span id="v8_7_1_77"><sup><small>8:7:1:77.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he now lays down these two;—this fire-altar is the year, and the year is these worlds: the fifth layer of this (altar) is the sky, and the dewy season of this (year) is the sky; and when he now lays down these two (bricks), he thereby restores to his (Agni's) body what these two are thereto: this is why he now lays down these two (bricks).

<span id="v8_7_1_88"><sup><small>8:7:1:88.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he now lays down these two;—this Agni (the fire-altar) is Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of generation), and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year: the fifth layer is his (Agni's) head, and the dewy season is its (the year's) head; and when he now lays down these two (bricks), he thereby restores to his (or its) body what these two are thereto: this is why he now lays down these two (bricks).

<span id="v8_7_1_99"><sup><small>8:7:1:99.</small></sup></span>  He lays down the two seasonal ones prior to the naturally-perforated one and to the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis; for the last naturally-perforated one is the sky [^228], and the last Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis [^229] (all-light brick) is <span id="p128">[<sup><small>p. 128</small></sup>]</span> the sun: he thus places the seasons on this side of the sky and the sun; whence the seasons are on this side thereof. But generative power there also is (in these seasonal bricks) [^230]: he thus places generative power on this side of the sky and the sun; whence procreation takes place only on this side of them, but stationary, indeed, is procreation beyond them, for just as many gods as there were of old, so many there are now.

<span id="v8_7_1_1010"><sup><small>8:7:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  Now, the (first) two seasonal (bricks) he lays down subsequently to the first naturally-perforated one, and to the first Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis; for the first naturally-perforated one is this (earth), and the first Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis is Agni: thereupon he places the seasons, whence the seasons are upwards from this (earth). But generative power there also is therein: he thus places generative power above this (earth); whence procreation only takes place above (upon, not under) this (earth).

<span id="v8_7_1_1111"><sup><small>8:7:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  Let him not derange these (seasonal bricks) [^231] lest he should derange the seasons, for deranged are <span id="p129">[<sup><small>p. 129</small></sup>]</span> the seasons for him who dies: hence, in whatever place he lays down the first two, there let him lay down all.

<span id="v8_7_1_1212"><sup><small>8:7:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  But the seasonal (bricks), indeed, are also these (three) worlds: by the (different) layers he thus builds up these worlds one above the other. And the seasonal (bricks), indeed, are also the nobility: by the (different) layers he thus builds up the nobility above (the peasantry). And the seasonal ones, indeed, are also the year: by the (different) layers he thus builds up the year. Let him not thereafter place over them any other brick with a sacrificial formula, lest he should place the peasantry above the nobility.

<span id="v8_7_1_1313"><sup><small>8:7:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  Now these same (bricks) are indeed steppingstones, for by means of the seasonal (bricks) the gods then stepped over these worlds, hath from hence upwards and from above downwards: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by means of the seasonal (bricks), step over these worlds, both from hence upwards and from above downwards.

<span id="v8_7_1_1414"><sup><small>8:7:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  Now, the <i>K</i>arakâdhvaryus lay down here yet other ‘stepping-stones’; but let him not do so, for they do what is redundant, and these are indeed (all) the stepping-stones.

<span id="v8_7_1_1515"><sup><small>8:7:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down a Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis (all-light brick);—the last Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis, doubtless, is the sun, for in yonder (celestial) world the sun, indeed, is ‘all the light’: it is the sun he thereby sets up.

<span id="v8_7_1_1616"><sup><small>8:7:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down a Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis:—the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis, doubtless, means progeny, for progeny indeed is all the light:—he thus lays generative power into it (or into him, Agni and the Sacrificer). <span id="p130">[<sup><small>p. 130</small></sup>]</span> 8:7:1:1717\. He lays down the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis prior to the naturally-perforated one;—for the last naturally-perforated one is the sky, and the last Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis is the sun: he thus places the sun on this side (below) the sky, whence he burns only on this side thereof. But there also is generative power therein: he thus places generative power on this side of the sky, whence procreation takes place only on this side thereof.

<span id="v8_7_1_1818"><sup><small>8:7:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  Now the (first) Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis he lays down subsequent to the first naturally-perforated one; for the first naturally-perforated one is this (earth), and the first Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis is Agni: he thus sets up Agni upwards from this (earth), whence the fire blazes upwards from here. But there also is generative power therein: he thus places generative power above this (earth), whence procreation only takes place above this (earth).

<span id="v8_7_1_1919"><sup><small>8:7:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  And the (second) Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis he lays down subsequent to the second naturally-perforated one (in the third, or central) layer; for the second naturally-perforated one is the air, and the second Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis is Vâyu (the wind): he thus places the wind in the air, whence that wind (has his abode) in the air.

<span id="v8_7_1_2020"><sup><small>8:7:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  These (three) then are the lights;—and when he lays down these (three Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis bricks) in this way, he thereby sets up those same lights so as to face each other; and hence the fire blazes upwards from this (earth), and yonder sun shines downwards, and that wind blows sideways in the air.

<span id="v8_7_1_2121"><sup><small>8:7:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  \[He ‘settles’ the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 58\], ‘May Paramesh<i>th</i>in settle thee’—for Paramesh<i>th</i>in saw this fifth layer;—‘on the back <span id="p131">[<sup><small>p. 131</small></sup>]</span> of the sky, thee, the luminous one!’—for on the back of the sky is yonder luminous sun.

<span id="v8_7_1_2222"><sup><small>8:7:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  ‘For all out-breathing, and off-breathing, and through-breathing,’—for the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis is the breath, and breath, indeed, is (necessary) for everything here;—‘bestow thou all the light!’—that is, ‘bestow thou the whole (or every) light;’—‘Sûrya is thine overlord,’—he thereby makes Sûrya (the sun) its overlord. Having ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: its (symbolical) meaning has been told [^232].

<span id="v8_7_1_2323"><sup><small>8:7:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  Now, these (bricks) are indeed stepping-stones, for by means of the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis (bricks) the gods then stepped over these worlds, both from hence upwards, and from above downwards: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by means of the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis, step over these worlds, both from hence upwards, and from above downwards.

<span id="v8_7_1_2424"><sup><small>8:7:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  Now, the <i>K</i>arakâdhvaryus lay down here yet other ‘stepping-stones’; but let him not do so, for they do what is redundant, and these are indeed the stepping-stones.


<span id="v8_7_2"><sup><small>8:7:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v8_7_2_11"><sup><small>8:7:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down a Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â [^233] (space-filling brick); the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â, doubtless, is yonder <span id="p132">[<sup><small>p. 132</small></sup>]</span> sun, for he fills these worlds: it is thus yonder sun he thereby sets up. He lays down this (Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â) in all the (five) layers, for those layers are these (three) worlds [^234]: he thus places the sun in (all) these worlds, whence he shines for all these worlds.

<span id="v8_7_2_22"><sup><small>8:7:2:22.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down a Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â,—the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â, doubtless, is the nobility (or chieftaincy) [^235], and these other bricks are the peasants (or clansmen): he thus places the nobility (or chieftain), as the eater, among the peasantry. He lays it down in all the layers: he thus places the nobility, as the eater, among the whole peasantry (or in every clan).

<span id="v8_7_2_33"><sup><small>8:7:2:33.</small></sup></span>  Now this is only a single (brick): he thus makes the nobility (or the chieftaincy) and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). And what second (such brick there is) that is its mate,—a mate, doubtless, is one half of one's own self, for when one is with a mate then he is whole and complete: (thus it is laid down) for the sake of completeness. With a single formula he lays down many bricks [^236]: he thereby endows the nobility preeminently <span id="p133">[<sup><small>p. 133</small></sup>]</span> with power [^237], and makes the nobility more powerful than the peasantry. And the other (bricks) he lays down singly, with separate formulas: he thereby makes the peasantry less powerful than the nobility, differing in speech, and of different thoughts (from one another).

<span id="v8_7_2_44"><sup><small>8:7:2:44.</small></sup></span>  The first two (Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs) he lays down in that (south-east) corner: he thereby places yonder sun in that quarter: from this (earth) he follows him (the sun) from that (place) there [^238]; from this (earth) he follows him from that (place) there; from this (earth) he follows hire from that (place) there; from this (earth) he follows him from that (place) there.

<span id="v8_7_2_55"><sup><small>8:7:2:55.</small></sup></span>  And in whatever place he lays down the first two (bricks), let him there lay down alongside of <span id="p134">[<sup><small>p. 134</small></sup>]</span> them the last two (bricks): for (otherwise) having once revolved round these worlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two last alongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that sun to pass by these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly round these worlds again and again (from left) to right.

<span id="v8_7_2_66"><sup><small>8:7:2:66.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays them down, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 59\], ‘Fill the space! fill the gap!’—that is, ‘fill up the space! fill up the gap;’—‘and lie thou steady!’—that is, ‘and lie thou firm, settled!’—‘Indra and Agni, and B<i>ri</i>haspati, have settled thee in this womb;’ that is, ‘Indra and Agni, and B<i>ri</i>haspati, have established thee in this womb.’ Thus (he establishes them) by an anush<i>t</i>ubh verse; for the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech, and Indra is speech, and the space-filler is Indra. He does not settle them, for that (sun) is unsettled. He pronounces the Sûdadohas on them, for the Sûdadohas is vital air: he thus makes him (Agni) continuous and joins him together by means of the vital air.

<span id="v8_7_2_77"><sup><small>8:7:2:77.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say, ‘How does that Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â become of unimpaired strength?’ Well, the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â is yonder sun, and he assuredly is of unimpaired strength. And the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â also is speech, and of unimpaired strength assuredly is speech.

<span id="v8_7_2_88"><sup><small>8:7:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Having laid down those (bricks) possessed of (special) sacrificial formulas, he covers (the altar) with the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â; for the bricks possessed of formulas mean food, and the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â means the body: he thus encloses the food in the body, whence food enclosed in the body is the body itself. <span id="p135">[<sup><small>p. 135</small></sup>]</span> 8:7:2:99\. Those (bricks) possessed of formulas he places on the body (of the altar) itself, not on the wings and tail: he thus puts food into the body; and whatever food is put into the body that benefits both the body and the wings and tail; but that which he puts on the wings and tail benefits neither the body, nor the wings and tail.

<span id="v8_7_2_1010"><sup><small>8:7:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  On the body (of the altar) he places both (bricks) possessed of formulas and Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs; whence that body (of a bird) is, as it were, twice as thick. On the wings and tail (he places) only Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs, whence the wings and tail are, as it were, thinner. On the body (of the altar) he places them both lengthwise and crosswise, for the bricks are bones: hence these bones in the body run both lengthwise and crosswise. On the wings and tail (he places them so as to be) turned away (from the body), for in the wings and tail there is not a single transverse bone. And this, indeed, is the difference between a built and an unbuilt (altar): suchlike is the built one, different therefrom the unbuilt one [^239].

<span id="v8_7_2_1111"><sup><small>8:7:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  The Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â (naturally-perforated brick) he encloses with Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â (bricks); for the naturally-perforated one is the breath, and the ‘space-filler’ is the sun: he thus kindles the breath by means of the sun, whence this breath (of ours) is warm. With that (kind of brick) he fills up the whole body: he thereby kindles the whole body by means of the sun, whence this whole body (of ours) is warm. And this, indeed, is the difference between one that will live and one that will die: <span id="p136">[<sup><small>p. 136</small></sup>]</span> he that will live is warm, and he that will die is cold.

<span id="v8_7_2_1212"><sup><small>8:7:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  From the corner in which he lays down the first two (Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs) he goes on filling up (the altar) by tens up to the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â. In the same way he goes on filling it up from left to right behind the naturally-perforated one up to (the brick on) the cross-spine [^240]. He then fills it up whilst returning to that limit [^241].

<span id="v8_7_2_1313"><sup><small>8:7:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  The body (of the altar) he fills up first, for of (a bird) that is produced, the body is produced first, then the right wing, then the tail, then the left (wing): that is in the rightward (sunwise) way, for this is (the way) with the gods, and thus, indeed, yonder sun moves along these worlds from left to right.

<span id="v8_7_2_1414"><sup><small>8:7:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  The Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â, doubtless, is the same as the vital air; he therewith fills up the whole body (of the altar): he thus puts vital air into the whole body. If he were not to reach any member thereof, then the vital air would not reach that member of him (Agni); and whatever member the vital air does not reach, that, assuredly, either dries up or withers away: let him therefore fill up therewith the whole of it.

<span id="v8_7_2_1515"><sup><small>8:7:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  The wings and tail he builds on to the body, for the wings and tail grow on to the body; but were he first to lay down those (bricks) turned away (from the body), it would be as if he were to take a limb from elsewhere and put it on again. <span id="p137">[<sup><small>p. 137</small></sup>]</span> 8:7:2:1616\. Let him not lay down either a broken (brick) or a black one; for one that is broken causes failure, and sickly is that form which is black: ‘Lest I should make up a sickly body,’ he thinks [^242]. Let him not throw aside an unbroken (brick), lest he should put what is not sickly outside the body. Whatever (bricks), in counting from the dhish<i>n</i>ya hearths, should exceed a Virâ<i>g</i> [^243], and not make up another, such (bricks) indeed cause failure: let him break them and throw them [^244] (ut-kir) on the heap of rubbish (utkara), for the heap of rubbish is the seat of what is redundant: thus he thereby settles them where there is. the seat of that which is redundant.

<span id="v8_7_2_1717"><sup><small>8:7:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  Now, then, of the measures of the bricks. In the first and last layers let him lay down (bricks) of a foot (square), for the foot is a support; and the hand is the same as the foot. The largest (bricks) should be of the measure of the thigh-bone, for there is no bone larger than the thigh-bone. Three layers should have (their bricks) marked with three lines, for threefold are these worlds; and two (layers <span id="p138">[<sup><small>p. 138</small></sup>]</span> may consist) of (bricks) marked with an indefinite number of lines, for these two layers are the flavour, and the flavour is indefinite; but all (the layers) should rather have (bricks) marked with three lines, for threefold are all these worlds.

<span id="v8_7_2_1818"><sup><small>8:7:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  Now, then, of the location [^245] of (special) bricks. Any (special) brick he knows, provided with a formula, let him place in the middle (third) layer; for the middle layer is the air, and the air, doubtless, is the location of all beings. Moreover, bricks with (special) formulas are food, and the middle layer is the belly: he thus puts food into the belly.

<span id="v8_7_2_1919"><sup><small>8:7:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  Here, now, they say, ‘Let him not lay down (such special bricks) lest he should do what is excessive.’ But he may, nevertheless, lay them down; for such bricks are laid down for (the fulfilment of special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. But let him rather not lay them down, for just that much the gods then did.


<span id="v8_7_3"><sup><small>8:7:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v8_7_3_11"><sup><small>8:7:3:11.</small></sup></span>  He now throws loose soil (on the layer); for the loose soil means flesh: he thus covers him (Agni) with flesh. \[He does so\] after having laid down the bricks;—the bricks are the bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh.

<span id="v8_7_3_22"><sup><small>8:7:3:22.</small></sup></span>  He also strews it on (the place where lies) the naturally-perforated (brick), for the naturally-perforated one means vital air, and the loose soil <span id="p139">[<sup><small>p. 139</small></sup>]</span> means food: he thus puts food into (the channels of) the vital air. In that manner [^246] he covers the whole body (of the altar); whence the food which is put into (the channels of) the vital air benefits the whole body, extends over the whole body.

<span id="v8_7_3_33"><sup><small>8:7:3:33.</small></sup></span>  ‘Let him not strew it on (the place of) the naturally-perforated one,’ say some, ‘lest he should stop up (the channels of) the vital airs, for the naturally-perforated one is the vital air.’ Let him, nevertheless, strew it, for the vital airs are sustained by food, and whoever eats no food his (channels of the) vital airs grow up (and close): hence he for whom they act thus, comes to exist in yonder world even like a dry, hollow tube. Let him, therefore, by all means strew (loose soil) on (the place of) the naturally-perforated one.

<span id="v8_7_3_44"><sup><small>8:7:3:44.</small></sup></span>  Having strewed it on the svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â (place) he goes on covering (the altar) from the (brick) on the cross-spine up to the enclosing-stones. In the same way he goes on covering it from left to right behind the naturally-perforated one up to the one on the cross-spine again.

<span id="v8_7_3_55"><sup><small>8:7:3:55.</small></sup></span>  The body (of the altar) he covers first, for of (a bird) that is produced, the body is the first to be produced; then the right wing, then the tail, then the left wing: that is in the rightward (sunwise) way, for this is (the way) with the gods.

<span id="v8_7_3_66"><sup><small>8:7:3:66.</small></sup></span>  Now this loose soil, indeed, is the vital air; he therewith covers the whole body: he thus puts vital air into the whole body. And, assuredly, whatsoever member thereof he should not reach, that member of him (Agni) the vital air would not <span id="p140">[<sup><small>p. 140</small></sup>]</span> reach; and whatever member the vital air does not reach that either dries up or withers away: let him, therefore, cover it entirely therewith.

<span id="v8_7_3_77"><sup><small>8:7:3:77.</small></sup></span>  \[^247], with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 56; <i>Ri</i>g-veda I, 11, 1\], ‘They all have magnified Indra,’—for all beings, indeed, magnify Indra;—‘the voices, him, of ocean-wide extent,’—he thereby alludes to his greatness;—‘the foremost of charioteers,’—for of charioteers he is the greatest charioteer;—‘the lordly lord of viands,’—viands mean food: thus, ‘the lordly lord of food.’ With this anush<i>t</i>ubh verse addressed to Indra he scatters it; for the loose soil belongs to Indra: that (layer of) loose soil is one half of Agni (the fire-altar), the (other) half is the collection of bricks.

<span id="v8_7_3_88"><sup><small>8:7:3:88.</small></sup></span>  Here, now, they say, ‘Whilst he lays down the bricks with all kinds of metres, and with (verses addressed to) all deities, he now scatters (the soil) with a single (verse) addressed to a single deity,—how is this one half of Agni?’ Indra, surely, is equal to all the gods; hence in that he scatters it with a (verse) addressed to Indra, this (soil) is one half of Agni. And as to its being (done) with an anush<i>t</i>ubh verse,—the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech, and all metres are speech: thereby also it is one half.

<span id="v8_7_3_99"><sup><small>8:7:3:99.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down the Vikar<i>n</i>î and Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â (bricks),—the Vikar<i>n</i>î is Vâyu (the wind), and the last naturally-perforated one is the sky: he thus sets up both the wind and the sky. He lays them down as the last (highest), for wind and sky are the highest; and close together, for wind and <span id="p141">[<sup><small>p. 141</small></sup>]</span> sky are close together. The Vikar<i>n</i>î he lays down first: he thereby places the wind on this side of the sky; whence that wind blows only on this side (thereof).

<span id="v8_7_3_1010"><sup><small>8:7:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down the Vikar<i>n</i>î. When, on that (former) occasion, they make the horse smell (the pile of bricks of) the (first) layer [^248], then yonder sun strings these worlds to himself on a thread. Now that thread is the same as the wind; and that wind is the same as this Vikar<i>n</i>î: thus when he lays down the latter, then yonder sun strings to himself these worlds on a thread.

<span id="v8_7_3_1111"><sup><small>8:7:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down the Vikar<i>n</i>î and the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â; the Vikar<i>n</i>î, doubtless, is vital power, and the naturally-perforated one is vital air: he thus bestows both vital power and vital air. He lays them down as the two last (highest bricks), because vital power and vital air are the two highest (endowments); and close together, because vital power and vital air are closely (bound) together. The upper (northern) Vikar<i>n</i>î he lays down first [^249]: he thereby encloses the vital air on both sides in vital power.

<span id="v8_7_3_1212"><sup><small>8:7:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays it down, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 62; <i>Ri</i>g-veda VII, 3, 2\], ‘When, like a snorting steed, that longeth for the pasture, he started forth from the great enclosure, then the wind fanned his flame, and black then was thy path;’—for when the wind fans his (Agni's) flame, <span id="p142">[<sup><small>p. 142</small></sup>]</span> then his path does become black. With a trish<i>t</i>ubh verse he lays it down, because Vâyu (the wind) is of trish<i>t</i>ubh nature; with one relating to Agni, because it is Agni's performance; with an undefined one, because Vâyu is undefined. And as to his saying ‘the wind,’ Vâyu indeed is the wind.

<span id="v8_7_3_1313"><sup><small>8:7:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 63), ‘I seat thee in the seat of the vital power,’—the vital power, doubtless, is yonder (sun), and his seat this is;—‘the animating,’—for he (the sun) animates all this universe;—‘in the shadow,’—for in his shadow all this universe is;—‘in the heart of the sea,’—for this, indeed, is the heart of the (aerial) sea [^250];—‘the radiant, the luminous,’—for radiant and luminous is the sky;—‘thou that illumines the sky, the earth and the wide air;’—for thus, indeed, does he (the sun) illumine these worlds.

<span id="v8_7_3_1414"><sup><small>8:7:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  ‘May Paramesh<i>th</i>in settle thee,’—for Paramesh<i>th</i>in saw this fifth layer [^251].

<span id="v8_7_3_1515"><sup><small>8:7:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays it down by means of Paramesh<i>th</i>in. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati had become disjointed, the deities took him and went off in different directions. Paramesh<i>th</i>in took his head, and kept going away from him.

<span id="v8_7_3_1616"><sup><small>8:7:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  He spake to him, ‘Come to me and restore unto me that wherewith thou hast gone from me!’—‘What will therefrom accrue to me?’—‘That part of my body shall be sacred to thee!’—‘So be it!’ So Paramesh<i>th</i>in restored that to him.

<span id="v8_7_3_1717"><sup><small>8:7:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  Now that last self-perforated (brick) is just <span id="p143">[<sup><small>p. 143</small></sup>]</span> that part of him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati-Agni); and when he now lays it down in this place, he thereby restores to him what part of his body this is: that is why he lays it down in this place.

<span id="v8_7_3_1818"><sup><small>8:7:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  ‘On the back of the sky, thee, the wide and broad one!’—for this (top of the altar) is indeed the back of the sky, and it is both wide and broad [^252];—‘Sustain thou the sky! make firm the sky! injure not the sky!’—that is, ‘Sustain thy self, make firm thy self, injure not thy self (body)!’

<span id="v8_7_3_1919"><sup><small>8:7:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  ‘For all out-breathing, off-breathing, through-breathing, up-breathing!’—the naturally-perforated (brick) is the vital air, and the vital air truly serves for everything here;—‘for a resting-place, for a moving-place!’—the naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds, and these worlds are the resting-place and the moving-place;—‘May Sûrya guard thee,’—that is, ‘May Sûrya protect thee,’—‘with mighty well-being,’—that is, ‘with great well-being;’—‘with the safest roof!’—that is, ‘with whatever roof (abode) is the safest.’

<span id="v8_7_3_2020"><sup><small>8:7:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  Separately he lays them down, for separate are wind and sky; and once only he ‘settles’ them: he thereby makes them the same, for vital power and vital air are the same. They are both of them stones and both of them naturally-perforated; for vital power and vital air are the same. He then pronounces the Sûdadohas over them,—the Sûdadohas means vital air; he thus makes them <span id="p144">[<sup><small>p. 144</small></sup>]</span> continuous, joins them together by means of the vital air.

<span id="v8_7_3_2121"><sup><small>8:7:3:2121.</small></sup></span>  ‘Those his well-like milking ones [^253]’—a well (sûda) means water, and milking means food;—‘the speckled ones mix the Soma,’—the speckled (cow) means food;—‘at the birth of the gods,’—the birth of the gods is the year;—‘the tribes,’ the tribes (vi<i>s</i>), doubtless, are the sacrifice, for all beings are ranged (vish<i>t</i>a) [^254] under the sacrifice;—‘in the three spheres of the heavens,’—the three spheres of the heavens, doubtless, are the (three) pressings (of Soma): he thus means the pressings. With an anush<i>t</i>ubh verse (he performs this rite), for the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech, and speech (includes) all vital airs; and by means of speech, that is vital air, he thus makes these two (bricks) continuous, and joins them together. This same Sûdadohas, whilst being a single (verse), extends over all the bricks, whence—the Sûdadohas being the vital air—this vital air, whilst being one only, extends over all the limbs, over the whole body.


<span id="v8_7_4"><sup><small>8:7:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v8_7_4_11"><sup><small>8:7:4:11.</small></sup></span>  On the (three) naturally-perforated (bricks) he (the Sacrificer) sings sâmans; for the naturally-perforated ones are these (three) worlds; and they <span id="p145">[<sup><small>p. 145</small></sup>]</span> are just these (ordinary) stones. The gods, having laid them down, saw them as such: that they were dry stones.

<span id="v8_7_4_22"><sup><small>8:7:4:22.</small></sup></span>  They spake, ‘Think ye upon this, how we may lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds!’ They spake, ‘Meditate ye!’ whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, ‘Seek ye a layer! seek ye how we may lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds!’

<span id="v8_7_4_33"><sup><small>8:7:4:33.</small></sup></span>  Whilst meditating, they saw these sâmans (hymn-tunes), and sang them; and by means of them they laid sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, when he sings these sâmans, lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds.

<span id="v8_7_4_44"><sup><small>8:7:4:44.</small></sup></span>  Over the naturally-perforated ones he sings them: the naturally-perforated ones being these worlds, it is into these worlds that he thereby lays sap, the means of subsistence.

<span id="v8_7_4_55"><sup><small>8:7:4:55.</small></sup></span>  He sings (the tunes) on the (mystic) words ‘Bhûs, Bhuvas, Svar’;—bhûs (earth), doubtless, is this world, bhuvas is the air-world, and svar (light) is yonder world: into these worlds he thereby lays sap, the means of subsistence.

<span id="v8_7_4_66"><sup><small>8:7:4:66.</small></sup></span>  They have different preludes, and the same finale [^255]; and as to their having different preludes, it <span id="p146">[<sup><small>p. 146</small></sup>]</span> is because they (the gods) saw them separately; and as to their having the same finale (nidhana), it is because there is only one foundation, only one finale to the sacrifice—even heaven: therefore they have ‘svar-<i>g</i>yotis (heaven-light)’ for their finale.

<span id="v8_7_4_77"><sup><small>8:7:4:77.</small></sup></span>  He then bestrews him (Agni, the fire-altar and Agni's body) with chips of gold. Now that whole Agni had been completed, and the gods bestowed on him immortality, that highest form; and in like manner does this one now bestow upon him that highest, immortal form [^256].

<span id="v8_7_4_88"><sup><small>8:7:4:88.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he bestrews him with chips of gold. Now on that former occasion he first lays into him that pleasing form, the gold plate and the (gold) man [^257]; and he now decks him all over with a pleasing form.

<span id="v8_7_4_99"><sup><small>8:7:4:99.</small></sup></span>  With two hundred (chips he bestrews him) each time,—two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni <span id="p147">[<sup><small>p. 147</small></sup>]</span> is the sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows upon him immortality, that highest form. Five times (he strews),—five-layered is the altar, five seasons make a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows upon him immortality, that highest form. With a thousand (chips he bestrews him),—a thousand means everything: with everything he thus confers upon him immortality, that highest form.

<span id="v8_7_4_1010"><sup><small>8:7:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  First (he scatters them) at the back whilst standing with his face towards the east; then on the left (north) side towards the south; then in front whilst facing the west; then, having gone round the back, from the south whilst facing the north: this is from left to right (sunwise), for that is (the way) with the gods. Then, having gone round, (he scatters chips) at the back whilst standing with his face to the east, for in this way that former performance of him [^258] took place.

<span id="v8_7_4_1111"><sup><small>8:7:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  \[He scatters, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 65\], ‘The fore-measure of a thousand thou art,—The counter-measure of a thousand thou art,—The up-measure of a thousand thou art,—The thousandfold thou art,—For a thousand thee!’—a thousand, doubtless, means everything: thus, ‘Everything thou art,—thee for everything!’

<span id="v8_7_4_1212"><sup><small>8:7:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  Now, then, the consideration of the layer-fillings. The first layer is this (terrestrial) world; and the filling of soil means cattle: thus, in <span id="p148">[<sup><small>p. 148</small></sup>]</span> covering the first layer with a filling of soil he covers this (terrestrial) world with cattle.

<span id="v8_7_4_1313"><sup><small>8:7:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  The second layer is the air, and the filling of soil means birds: thus, in covering the second layer with a filling of soil, he covers (fills) the air with birds.

<span id="v8_7_4_1414"><sup><small>8:7:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  The third layer is the sky, and the filling of soil means stars; thus, in covering the third layer with a filling of soil, he covers the sky with stars.

<span id="v8_7_4_1515"><sup><small>8:7:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  The fourth layer is the sacrifice, and the filling of soil means sacrificial gifts: thus, in covering the fourth layer with a filling of soil, he covers the sacrifice with sacrificial gifts (to the priests).

<span id="v8_7_4_1616"><sup><small>8:7:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  The fifth layer is the Sacrificer, and the filling of soil means progeny (or subjects) thus, in covering the fifth layer with a filling of soil, he covers (abundantly supplies) the Sacrificer with progeny (or subjects).

<span id="v8_7_4_1717"><sup><small>8:7:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  The sixth layer is the heavenly world, and the filling of soil means the gods: thus in covering the sixth layer with a filling of soil, he fills the heavenly world with gods.

<span id="v8_7_4_1818"><sup><small>8:7:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  The seventh layer is immortality,—that is the last (layer) he lays down, and thus bestows immortality as the highest thing of all this (universe): therefore immortality is the highest thing of all this (universe); therefore the gods are not separated therefrom; and therefore they are immortal. Thus much as to the deity [^259].

<span id="v8_7_4_1919"><sup><small>8:7:4:1919.</small></sup></span>  Now, as to the Self (body). The first layer is the legs, and the downward flowing vital air; and <span id="p149">[<sup><small>p. 149</small></sup>]</span> the filling of soil is the flesh: thus, in covering the first layer with a filling of soil, he covers that (part) of his (Agni's) body with flesh. \[He does so\] after laying down bricks, and bricks mean bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh. He does not cover (the altar-site) below (the first layer), whence these vital airs are not closed up below; but, he covers it above, and thereby covers that (part) of his body above with flesh; and hence that (part) of his body above, being covered with flesh, is not visible.

<span id="v8_7_4_2020"><sup><small>8:7:4:2020.</small></sup></span>  The second layer is that (part of the body) which is above the legs and below the waist; and the filling of soil is flesh: thus, in covering the second layer with a filling of soil, he covers that (part) of his body with flesh. \[He does so\] after laying down bricks, and bricks mean bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh. He places them on a filling of soil, and covers them with a filling of soil: he thus covers that (part) of his body on both sides with flesh; whence that part of his body, being on both sides covered with flesh, is not visible.

<span id="v8_7_4_2121"><sup><small>8:7:4:2121.</small></sup></span>  The third layer is the waist itself; the fourth layer is that (part of the body) which is above the waist and below the neck; the fifth layer is the neck, the sixth layer is the head, and the seventh layer is the vital airs. This he lays down as the last (or highest): he thus makes the vital airs the highest of all this (universe), and hence the vital airs are the highest thing of all this (universe). He places it on a filling of soil; and the filling of soil means flesh; he thus covers (the channels of) the vital airs with flesh. He does not cover it above, whence these (channels of the) vital airs are not closed up above.

## Footnotes

[^227]: 125:3 Or, he places the chieftaincy in every clan.

[^228]: 126:1 Or, all this universe.

[^229]: 127:1 For the symbolic meaning of the three svayam-ât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>âs, as the central bricks of the first and third layers, and the one lying on the centre of the fifth layer, see part iii, p. 155, note 8.

[^230]: 127:2 On the three Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis bricks, placed in the same layers, as representing the gods Agni, Vâyu and Âditya respectively, see VI, 3, 3, 16; 5, 3, 3.

[^231]: 128:1 Or, But these (bricks) also are (or mean) generative power, cf. [paragraph 1](Book_4_8_7#v8_7_1_1).

[^232]: 128:2 That is, he is not to shift them from their proper place, but place each subsequent pair exactly on those laid down before. As a matter of fact, however, these two bricks (if we determine their site by mere calculation) would seem, in the fifth layer, to lie by half a foot further away from the central point, than the <i>Ri</i>tavyâs of the other layers do. This is owing to the fact that whilst, in the layers in which a Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â lies in the middle, only one half of these central bricks lie on the east side of the central point, in the present layer the eastern -portion of the Gârhapatya (occupying the central part of the layer) consists of full-sized bricks. This discrepancy of half a foot was probably made good by some space being left, which was afterwards filled up with earth; unless, indeed, the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>âs, as apparently natural stones, were allowed to somewhat exceed the ordinary size of bricks.

[^233]: 131:1 For this verse see part iii, p. 307, note 2; for its symbolic meaning (as the breath, or vital air) VII, 1, 1, 15; 26. See also [VIII, 7, 3, 21](Book_4_8_7#v8_7_3_21), where the verse itself is explained.

[^234]: 131:2 In laying down the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs of the fifth layer, he begins, as in the first layer, from the right shoulder, or the south-east corner, of the altar, but so that in this case the first ‘space-filler’ is laid down, not at the corner, but a cubit to the west of it. Starting from that spot, he fills up the available spaces, in two turns, moving in the sunwise fashion.

[^235]: 132:1 Rather, the first, second, and third layers are the three worlds.

[^236]: 132:2 At VI, 1, 2, 25 Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya was made to maintain that the Ya<i>g</i>ushmatîs, or bricks laid down with special formulas, were the nobility, and that the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs, laid down with one and the same formula, were the peasants, and as the noble (or chieftain) required a numerous clan for his subsistence, there should be fewer of the former kind of bricks, than the established practice was. This view was however rejected by the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and here, in opposition to that view, the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â is identified with the nobility, and the Ya<i>g</i>ushmatîs with the clan.

[^237]: 132:3 The common formula used with these bricks, and from which they derive their name—beginning as it does ‘Lokam p<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a,’ ‘Fill the space!’ see [parag. 6](Book_4_8_7#v8_7_2_6)\—is pronounced once only after every ten such bricks, and after any odd ones at the end.

[^238]: 133:1 In the translation of VII, 5, 2, 14 (part iii, p. 404), the passage ‘having taken possession of the man by strength,’ which was based on a wrong reading (see Weber, Berl. Cat. II, p. 69), should read thus: ‘having pre-eminently endowed man with power’ (or, perhaps, ‘having placed him above (others) in respect of power,’ St. Petersb. Dict.)

[^239]: 133:2 I do not know whether ‘atas’ might be taken here in the sense of ‘thither,’ or whether it goes along with ‘tasmât,’ merely strengthening it. The meaning in either case would seem to be this. In the first turn of filling up the empty spaces he first moves along from the south-east corner (the point where the sun rises) to the back or west end of the spine (the place where the sun sets) and the central brick; and having thus, as it were, touched the earth again, he proceeds from there in the same sunwise fashion, filling up the north part of the altar until he reaches the east end of the spine, and there, as it were, touches the earth once more. In the second turn he again begins (with the second brick) in the south-east, and repeats the same process, in filling up the south part of the altar, and completing at the southeast corner. The laying down of the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs would thus be supposed to occupy the full space of two days and two nights.

[^240]: 135:1 That is, one not properly built.

[^241]: 136:1 This would seem to be the Vikar<i>n</i>î (see [VIII, 7, 3, 9](Book_4_8_7#v8_7_3_9) seqq.) which, however, like the central Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â, is only to be laid down after the layer has been levelled up.

[^242]: 136:2 Viz. to the east end of the ‘spine.’

[^243]: 137:1 Here, as so often before, the effect to be avoided is expressed by a clause in _oratio directa_ with ‘ned’; the inserted clause with ‘vai’ indicating the reason why that effect is to be dreaded. To adapt the passage to our own mode of diction, we should have to translate:—Let him not lay down either a broken brick or a black one, lest he should form a sickly body; for a brick which is broken comes to grief, and what is black is of sickly appearance.—In the next sentence of the translation, the direct form of speech has been discarded.

[^244]: 137:2 The pâda of the Virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten, and a whole Virâ<i>g</i> stanza of thirty (or forty), syllables. Hence the number of the bricks is to be divisible by ten.

[^245]: 137:3 Or, perhaps, dig them in.

[^246]: 138:1 Âvapana has also the meaning of ‘throwing in, insertion,’ which is likewise understood here, whilst further on in this paragraph (‘the air is the âvapanam of all beings’) it can scarcely have this meaning (? something injected). Cf. [IX, 4, 2, 27](Book_4_9_4#v9_4_2_27).

[^247]: 139:1 Or, therewith (with loose soil).

[^248]: 140:1 Taking it from the edge of the <i>K</i>âtvâla or pit, cf. VII, 1, 1, 36.

[^249]: 141:1 See VII, 3, 2, 13.

[^250]: 141:2 As ‘uttarâm’ means both ‘northern’ and ‘higher,’ so ‘pûrvâm’ means both ‘first’ and ‘eastern,’ hence, by a whimsical play on these double meanings, ‘on both (or two) sides.’

[^251]: 142:1 The topmost naturally-perforated brick represents the heavens.

[^252]: 142:2 See VI, 2, 3, 5; 10.

[^253]: 143:1 Though, in the text of the formula, the adjectives are feminine, and evidently refer to the brick, the author here makes them neuter, referring them to ‘p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>am,’ the back (of the sky).

[^254]: 144:1 Part iii, p. 307, note 2, the following translation of this difficult and obscure verse was proposed:—‘At his birth the well-like milking, speckled ones mix the Soma (draught), the clans of the gods in the three spheres of the heavens.’

[^255]: 144:2 Literally, have entered, or settled. At XIV, 8, 13, 3, the same etymological word-play occurs, only ‘food (anne)’ being substituted for ‘sacrifice (ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>e)’; where the St. Petersb. Dict. takes ‘vish<i>t</i>a’ in the sense of ‘entered, i. e. contained.’

[^256]: 145:1 These hymn-tunes are given, Sam. Ved. V, p. 487, in the way in which they are here to be chanted. They consist entirely of the respective words, separated four times by musical interjections (stobhas) inserted between them, ending with the common finale: thus, (r) bhû<i>h</i>\—bhû<i>h</i>\—hoyi—bhû<i>h</i>\—hoyi—bhû<i>h</i>\—hâ~ûvâ~e—suvar<i>g</i>yotî~<i>h</i>; (2) bhuvâ<i>h</i>\—bhuva<i>h</i>\—hoyi—bhuva<i>h</i>\—hâ~ûvâ~e—suvar<i>g</i>yotî~<i>h</i>; (3) suvâ<i>h</i>\—suva<i>h</i>\—hoyi—suva<i>h</i>\—hoyi—suva<i>h</i>\—hâ~ûvâ~e—suvar<i>g</i>yotî~<i>h</i>. Along with these, as to be chanted on the same model, are given, (4) the ‘satya<i>m</i> sâman,’ beginning ‘satyâm—satyam—hoyi’ &c., and p. 146 (5) the ‘purusha-sâman,’ beginning ‘purushâ<i>h</i>\—purusha—hoyi’ &c.; which are similarly chanted by the Sacrificer at the beginning of the first layer, when laying down the lotus leaf (part iii, p. 363, where note 1 should be corrected in accordance with the present note), and the gold man (ib. p. 369, where the note requires likewise to be corrected), as the ‘<i>k</i>itre gâyati,’ ‘he sings on the bright one,’ of the text cannot refer to the ‘<i>K</i>itra-sâman’ there referred to. Cf. Lâ<i>t</i>y. S. I, 5, 8.—In regard to these sâmans (hymn-verses), the text might lead one to suppose that they only consist of two, instead of the usual four parts (omitting the intermediate Udgîtha and Pratihâra, cf. part ii, p. 310 note). The sâman being, however, sung by the Sacrificer himself, the usual distinction into parts to be performed by different chanters was probably dispensed with.

[^257]: 146:1 That is, the Sacrificer bestows it on Agni; with probably, however, the _double entente_, ‘this Adhvaryu priest bestows it on the Sacrificer.’

[^258]: 146:2 See VII, 4, 1, 10 seq.; 15 seq.

[^259]: 147:1 Viz. of Agni (and the Sacrificer). The ceremony alluded to was the fivefold libation of ghee offered on the gold man (representing Agni and the Sacrificer), see VII, 4, 1, 34-35.

[^260]: 148:1 That is, so much as to the objects to which the different parts of the altar are sacred or dedicated.
