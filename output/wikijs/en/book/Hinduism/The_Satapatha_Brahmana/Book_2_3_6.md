## SIXTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_6_1_11"><sup><small>3:6:1:11.</small></sup></span>  The Sadas [^378] is no other than his (Vish<i>n</i>u, the sacrifice's) belly; therefore they feed (drink) in the <span id="p141"><sup><small>[ p. 141 ]</small></sup></span> Sadas; for whatever food is eaten here on earth, all that settles down in the belly. And because all the gods sat (sad) in it, therefore it is called sadas: and so do these Brâhmans of every family now sit therein. By way of deity it belongs to Indra.

<span id="v3_6_1_22"><sup><small>3:6:1:22.</small></sup></span>  In the middle of it he puts up a (post) of udumbara wood (Ficus Glomerata); for the udumbara means strength and food; now the Sadas being his (Vish<i>n</i>u's belly), he thereby puts food therein; this is why he puts up an udumbara (post) in the middle of it.

<span id="v3_6_1_33"><sup><small>3:6:1:33.</small></sup></span>  From the peg [^379] which stands in the middle on the hind-part of the altar, he strides six steps eastwards (along the ‘spine’); the seventh he strides away from it to the right, for the sake of completeness, and there marks off a pit.

<span id="v3_6_1_44"><sup><small>3:6:1:44.</small></sup></span>  He takes the spade with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 26), ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, I take thee with the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, with the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman;’ the significance of this formula is the same (as before). That spade, indeed, is a female (feminine): therefore. he says ‘thou art a woman.’

<span id="v3_6_1_55"><sup><small>3:6:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He then marks off the pit with, ‘Herewith <span id="p142"><sup><small>[ p. 142 ]</small></sup></span> I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!’ for the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he cuts off the necks of the evil spirits.

<span id="v3_6_1_66"><sup><small>3:6:1:66.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he digs: eastwards he throws up the heap of earth. Having made the udumbara (post) of the same size as the sacrificer [^380], he cuts it smooth all round, and lays it down, with the top to the east, in front (of the pit). Thereon he lays barhis-grass of the same length.

<span id="v3_6_1_77"><sup><small>3:6:1:77.</small></sup></span>  Now the sprinkling-water (used on this occasion) contains barley-corns. For the essence (sap) of plants is water; wherefore plants when eaten alone do not satiate; and the essence of water, on the other hand, are the plants; wherefore water when drunk alone does not satiate; but only when the two are united they satiate; for then they are sapful: ‘with the sapful I will sprinkle,’ so he thinks.

<span id="v3_6_1_88"><sup><small>3:6:1:88.</small></sup></span>  Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, were contending. Then all the plants went away from the gods, but the barley plants alone went not from them.

<span id="v3_6_1_99"><sup><small>3:6:1:99.</small></sup></span>  The gods then prevailed: by means of these (barley-grains) they attracted to themselves all the plants of their enemies; and because they attracted (yu) therewith, therefore they are called yava (barley).

<span id="v3_6_1_1010"><sup><small>3:6:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Come, let us put into the barley whatever sap there is of all plants!’ And, accordingly, whatever sap there was of all plants, that they put into the barley: therefore the latter thrives lustily where other plants wither, for in such wise <span id="p143"><sup><small>[ p. 143 ]</small></sup></span> did they put the sap into them. And in like manner does this one now by means of those (barley-grains) attract to himself all the plants of his enemies: this is why the sprinkling-water contains barley-corns.

<span id="v3_6_1_1111"><sup><small>3:6:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  He throws the barley-corns into it, with, ‘Thou art barley (yava): keep thou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!’ In this there is nothing obscure. He then besprinkles (the post);—the significance of the sprinkling is one and the same: he thereby renders it sacrificially pure.

<span id="v3_6_1_1212"><sup><small>3:6:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  He sprinkles (the top, middle, and bottom parts), with, ‘For the sky—thee! for the air—thee! for the earth—thee!’ He thereby endows these worlds with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.

<span id="v3_6_1_1313"><sup><small>3:6:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  And the sprinkling-water which remains he pours into the hole, with, ‘Be the worlds pure wherein the Fathers reside!’ for a pit that is dug is sacred to the Fathers: this he thereby renders sacrificially pure.

<span id="v3_6_1_1414"><sup><small>3:6:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  He now strews barhis-grass therein, both eastward-pointed and northward-pointed with, ‘Thou art the seat of the Fathers;’ for that part of it (the post) which is dug into the ground is sacred to the Fathers; as though it were (naturally) established [^381] among plants, and not dug in, so does it become established among those plants.

<span id="v3_6_1_1515"><sup><small>3:6:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  He raises it, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 27), ‘Prop thou the sky! fill the air! stand firm on the earth!’ Thereby he endows these worlds with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds. <span id="p144"><sup><small>[ p. 144 ]</small></sup></span> 3:6:1:1616\. He then sinks it (in the hole, with), ‘May Dyutâna, the son of the Maruts, plant thee!—’ Dyutâna the son of the Maruts, doubtless, is he that blows yonder (the wind): by means of him he thus plants it;—‘Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a with firm support!’ Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a are the in-breathing and out-breathing: he thus plants it with the in-breathing and out-breathing.

<span id="v3_6_1_1717"><sup><small>3:6:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  He then heaps up (earth) round it, with, ‘I enclose thee, winner of the priesthood, winner of the nobility, winner of growth of wealth!’ Manifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the sacrificial texts: by this one he prays for the priesthood and nobility, those two vital forces [^382]. ‘Winner of growth of wealth,’—growth of wealth means abundance: he thereby prays for abundance.

<span id="v3_6_1_1818"><sup><small>3:6:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  He then presses it firmly all round, with, ‘Uphold thou the priesthood! uphold the nobility, uphold our life, uphold our progeny!’ this is the blessing of this rite: that blessing he thereby invokes. He presses it so as to be level with the ground: with an (ordinary) hole (round trees for watering) it is higher than the ground, but in this way it is with the gods;—and thus it is not planted in an (ordinary) hole.

<span id="v3_6_1_1919"><sup><small>3:6:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  He then pours water thereon;—wherever, in digging, they wound or injure this (earth),—water being a means of soothing,—there he soothes it by that means of soothing, water, there he heals it by water: therefore he pours water thereon. <span id="p145"><sup><small>[ p. 145 ]</small></sup></span> 3:6:1:2020\. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, while touching it thus (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 28), ‘Thou art firm: may this sacrificer be firm in this homestead through progeny’—or, ‘through cattle!’ thus whatever wish he entertains that wish is accomplished unto him.

<span id="v3_6_1_2121"><sup><small>3:6:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon, having taken clarified butter with the dipping-spoon, he pours it upon the (forked) top [^383], with ‘O Heaven and Earth, be ye full of ghee!’ whereby he endows the heaven and the earth with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on them: upon them thus full of sap and affording subsistence, these creatures subsist.

<span id="v3_6_1_2222"><sup><small>3:6:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  He then lays on a mat [^384], with, 'Thou art Indra's mat,'—for the Sadas belongs to Indra,—‘a shelter to every one,’ for Brâhmans of all families sit therein. He adds two mats, one on each side thereof, and three north of them and three further (to the north): these make nine. For the sacrifice <span id="p146"><sup><small>[ p. 146 ]</small></sup></span> is threefold and nine also is threefold: for this reason there are nine.

<span id="v3_6_1_2323"><sup><small>3:6:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  That Sadas has its tie-beams running (from south) to north, and the cart-shed (from west) to east. For this, the cart-shed, belongs exclusively to the gods: hence neither food nor drink is taken therein, because it belongs exclusively to the gods; and were any one either to eat or to drink therein, his head would verily burst asunder. But those two, the Âgnîdhra and the Sadas, are common (to the gods and men): hence food and drink is taken in these two, because they are common (to the gods and men). Now the north is the quarter of men: therefore the Sadas has its tie-beams running (from south) to north.

<span id="v3_6_1_2424"><sup><small>3:6:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  They enclose it [^385], with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 29; Rig-veda I, 10, 12), ‘May these songs encompass thee on every side, O thou that delightest in songs! May these favours be favourably received by thee, invigorating the vigorous!’ He that delights in songs, forsooth, is Indra, and songs mean the people: he thus surrounds the nobility with the people, and therefore the nobility is here surrounded on both sides by the people.

<span id="v3_6_1_2525"><sup><small>3:6:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he sews (the hurdles to the posts) with a needle and cord [^386], with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 30), 'Thou art Indra's sewer.' With, 'Thou art Indra's fixed (point),' he then makes a knot, ‘lest it should fall asunder.’ He undoes it again, when the work is completed; and thus disease befalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. When completed, he <span id="p147"><sup><small>[ p. 147 ]</small></sup></span> touches it (the Sadas) with, 'Thou art Indra's own!' for the Sadas belongs to Indra.

<span id="v3_6_1_2626"><sup><small>3:6:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  In the north—with regard to the back part of the Soma-carts [^387]\—he then raises the Âgnîdhra (shed). One half of it should be inside the altar, and one half outside; or more than one half may be inside the altar and less outside; or the whole of it may be inside the altar. When completed, he touches it with, ‘Thou art the All-gods’ own!’ To the All-gods it belongs, because on the day before (the Soma feast) the All-gods abide in it by the Vasatîvarî water.

<span id="v3_6_1_2727"><sup><small>3:6:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. The Asura-Rakshas attacked them from the south and forced them out of the Sadas, and overturned those hearths (dhish<i>n</i>ya) of theirs which are within the Sadas.

<span id="v3_6_1_2828"><sup><small>3:6:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  For, indeed, all of those (hearths) at one time burnt as brightly as this Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya and the Âgnîdhrîya; but ever since that time when they (the Asuras) overturned them they do not burn. They forced them (the gods) back to the Âgnîdhra (fire) and even won from them one half of the Âgnîdhra. From there the All-gods gained immortality [^388],—whence it (the Âgnîdhra fire) is sacred to the All-gods. <span id="p148"><sup><small>[ p. 148 ]</small></sup></span> 3:6:1:2929\. The gods kindled them again, as one would (light the fire where he is going to) stay. Therefore they are kindled at every Soma feast. Wherefore the duties of the Agnîdh should be discharged by one who is accomplished. Now he who is known and learned in sacred lore [^389] is truly accomplished: hence they take to the Agnîdh his Dakshi<i>n</i>â first [^390], since it is from thence (from the Agnîdh's fire) that the gods gained immortality. And if weakness were to come upon one of those that are consecrated, let (the Adhvaryu) say, ‘Lead him to the Âgnîdhra!’—thinking ‘that is unscathed, there he will not meet with affliction [^391].’ And because the All-gods gained immortality from there, therefore it is sacred to the All-gods.


<span id="v3_6_2"><sup><small>3:6:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_6_2_11"><sup><small>3:6:2:11.</small></sup></span>  The Dhish<i>n</i>ya-hearths [^392], forsooth, are no other <span id="p149"><sup><small>[ p. 149 ]</small></sup></span> than its (the sacrifice's) congeners [^393]. They have the same marks, and those which have the same marks are congeners; and these, then, are those (corresponding limbs) of its trunk.

<span id="v3_6_2_22"><sup><small>3:6:2:22.</small></sup></span>  Now Soma was in heaven, and the gods were here on earth. The gods desired, ‘Would that Soma might come to us; we might sacrifice with him, when come.’ They produced those two illusions, Supar<i>n</i>î and Kadrû [^394]; Supar<i>n</i>î, forsooth, was Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) [^395], and Kadrû was this (earth). They caused discord between them.

<span id="v3_6_2_33"><sup><small>3:6:2:33.</small></sup></span>  They then disputed and said, ‘Which of us shall spy furthest, shall win the other [^396].’—‘So be it!’ Kadrû then said, ‘Espy thou!’

<span id="v3_6_2_44"><sup><small>3:6:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Supar<i>n</i>î said, ‘On yonder shore of this ocean there stands a white horse at a post, that I see; doest thou also see it?’—‘I verily do!’ Then said Kadrû ‘Its tail was just now hanging down; there, now the wind tosses it, that I see.’

<span id="v3_6_2_55"><sup><small>3:6:2:55.</small></sup></span>  Now when Supar<i>n</i>î said, ‘On yonder shore of this ocean,’ the ocean, forsooth, is the altar, she thereby meant the altar; ‘there stands a white horse at a post,’ the white horse, forsooth, is Agni, and the post means the sacrificial stake. And when Kadrû said, ‘Its tail was just now hanging down; <span id="p150"><sup><small>[ p. 150 ]</small></sup></span> there, now the wind tosses it, that I see;’ this is nothing else than the rope.

<span id="v3_6_2_66"><sup><small>3:6:2:66.</small></sup></span>  Supar<i>n</i>î then said, ‘Come, let us now fly thither to know which of us is the winner.’ Kadrû said, ‘Fly thou thither; thou wilt tell us, which of us is the winner.’

<span id="v3_6_2_77"><sup><small>3:6:2:77.</small></sup></span>  Supar<i>n</i>î then flew thither; and it was even as Kadrû had said. When she had returned, she (Kadrû) said to her, ‘Hast thou won, or I?’—‘Thou!’ she replied. Such is the story called Supar<i>n</i>î-Kâdrava [^397].’

<span id="v3_6_2_88"><sup><small>3:6:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Then said Kadrû, ‘Verily I have won thine own self; yonder is Soma in the heaven: fetch him hither for the gods, and thereby redeem thyself from the gods [^398]!’—‘So be it!’ She brought forth the metres; and that Gâyatrî fetched Soma from heaven.

<span id="v3_6_2_99"><sup><small>3:6:2:99.</small></sup></span>  He was enclosed between two golden cups [^399]; sharp-edged they closed together at every twinkling of the eye; and these two, forsooth, were Consecration and Penance. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched over him; they are these hearths, these fire-priests.

<span id="v3_6_2_1010"><sup><small>3:6:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  She tore off one of the two cups, and gave it to the gods,—this was Consecration: therewith the gods consecrated themselves, <span id="p151"><sup><small>[ p. 151 ]</small></sup></span> 3:6:2:1111\. She then tore off the second cup, and gave it to the gods,—this was Penance: therewith the gods underwent penance, to wit the Upasads, for the Upasads are penance.

<span id="v3_6_2_1212"><sup><small>3:6:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  She took possession (â-<i>k</i>akhâda) [^400] of Soma by means of (a stick of) khadira wood (Acacia Catechu), whence (the name) Khadira; and because she thereby took possession of him, therefore the sacrificial stake and the wooden sword (sphya) are of khadira wood.

She then carried him off while he was under the charge of the A<i>kh</i>âvâka, wherefore this A<i>kh</i>âvâka priest was excluded (from drinking Soma).

<span id="v3_6_2_1313"><sup><small>3:6:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures, whence the A<i>kh</i>âvâka priest belongs to Indra and Agni.

<span id="v3_6_2_1414"><sup><small>3:6:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  Therefore the consecrated keep charge of the king (Soma), ‘lest (the Gandharvas) should carry him off.’ Let him therefore guard him diligently, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is excluded (from the Soma).

<span id="v3_6_2_1515"><sup><small>3:6:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  Wherefore the students guard their teacher, his house, and cattle, lest he should be taken from them. Let him therefore guard him (Soma) diligently in that place, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is excluded therefrom. By means of him Supar<i>n</i>î redeemed herself from the gods; wherefore they say, ‘He who has sacrificed shares in the world of bliss.’ <span id="p152"><sup><small>[ p. 152 ]</small></sup></span> 3:6:2:1616\. Verily, even in being born, man, by his own self, is born as a debt (owing) to death. And in that he sacrifices, thereby he redeems himself from death, even as Supar<i>n</i>î then redeemed herself from the gods.

<span id="v3_6_2_1717"><sup><small>3:6:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  The gods worshipped with him. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens came after him; and having come up they said, ‘Do ye let us share in the sacrifice, exclude us not from the sacrifice; let there be for us also a share in the sacrifice!’

<span id="v3_6_2_1818"><sup><small>3:6:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘What will there be for us, then?’—‘Even as in yonder world we have been his keepers, so also will we be his keepers here on earth!’

<span id="v3_6_2_1919"><sup><small>3:6:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  The gods spake, ‘So be it!’ By saying, ‘(Here are) your Soma-wages . . .’ he assigns to them the price of the Soma [^401]. They then said unto them, ‘At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering!’ And accordingly, when he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots [^402], at the evening libation, that same offering of ghee falls to their share, but not one of Soma.

<span id="v3_6_2_2020"><sup><small>3:6:2:2020.</small></sup></span>  ‘And what they will offer in the fire that will satiate you;’ hence that which they offer in the fire satiates them. ‘And when they will move about, holding the Soma over each [^403], that will satiate you;’ hence when they move about, holding the Soma over each (hearth), that satiates them. <span id="p153"><sup><small>[ p. 153 ]</small></sup></span> Wherefore let not the Adhvaryu pass between [^404] the hearths, for the Adhvaryu carries the Soma, and they sit waiting for him (Soma) with open mouths, and he would enter into their open mouths; and either Agni would burn him, or else that god who rules over beasts (Rudra) would seek after him; hence whenever the Adhvaryu should have business in the hall, let him pass north of the Âgnîdhra shed.

<span id="v3_6_2_2121"><sup><small>3:6:2:2121.</small></sup></span>  Now it is for the protection of Soma that those (hearths) are thrown up, to wit the Âhavanîya in front (on the high altar), the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya in the south, and the Âgnîdhrîya in the north; and those that are in the Sadas (protect him) from behind.

<span id="v3_6_2_2222"><sup><small>3:6:2:2222.</small></sup></span>  They are in part raised [^405], in part they are assigned [^406]. And, in truth, they themselves insisted thereon, saying, ‘They shall in part raise us, and in part they shall assign us; thus we shall know again that heavenly world from which we have come, thus we shall not go astray.’

<span id="v3_6_2_2323"><sup><small>3:6:2:2323.</small></sup></span>  And whichever of them are raised they are <span id="p154"><sup><small>[ p. 154 ]</small></sup></span> thereby visibly in this world; but whichever of them are assigned they are thereby visibly in yonder world.

<span id="v3_6_2_2424"><sup><small>3:6:2:2424.</small></sup></span>  They have two names; for, in truth, they themselves insisted thereon, saying, ‘We have not prospered with these names, since Soma has been taken away from us; well, then, let us take each a second name!’ They took each a second name, and therewith prospered, inasmuch as they from whom the Soma-draught had been taken had a share in the sacrifice assigned to them; hence they have two names. Wherefore let a Brahman, if he prosper not, take a second name, for verily he prospers, whosoever, knowing this, takes a second name.

<span id="v3_6_2_2525"><sup><small>3:6:2:2525.</small></sup></span>  Now what he offers in the fire, that he offers unto the gods, thereby the gods exist; and what (Soma) is consumed in the Sadas, that he offers unto men, thereby men exist; and in that the Nârâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa [^407] cups of Soma) stand with the Soma-carts, thereby he offers unto the Fathers, thereby the Fathers exist.

<span id="v3_6_2_2626"><sup><small>3:6:2:2626.</small></sup></span>  But those creatures which are not admitted to the sacrifice are forlorn; wherefore he now admits to the sacrifice those creatures here on earth that are not forlorn; behind [^408] the men are the beasts; and behind the gods are the birds, the plants, and <span id="p155"><sup><small>[ p. 155 ]</small></sup></span> the trees; and thus whatsoever exists here on earth all that is admitted to the sacrifice. And verily both the gods and men, and the Fathers drink together [^409], and this is their symposium; of old they drank together visibly, but now they do so unseen.


<span id="v3_6_3"><sup><small>3:6:3</small></sup></span>

### THE VAISAR<i>G</i>INA OFFERINGS AND LEADING FORWARD OF AGNI AND SOMA.

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_6_3_11"><sup><small>3:6:3:11.</small></sup></span>  Verily he who consecrates himself, consecrates himself for the sake of this All; for he consecrates himself for the sacrifice, and this All indeed results from [^410] the sacrifice; having prepared the sacrifice for which he consecrates himself, he now sets free (or produces) this All.

<span id="v3_6_3_22"><sup><small>3:6:3:22.</small></sup></span>  The reason why he performs the Vaisar<i>g</i>ina offerings is this. They are called Vaisar<i>g</i>ina, because he sets free (vi-sar<i>g</i>) this All; wherefore let him who takes part in the rite [^411] touch (the sacrificer) from behind; but if he have to go elsewhere (on business) he need not heed this. When he sacrifices, he sets free this All.

<span id="v3_6_3_33"><sup><small>3:6:3:33.</small></sup></span>  And again why he performs the Vaisar<i>g</i>ina offerings. Vish<i>n</i>u, forsooth, is the sacrifice; by his strides he obtained (vi-kram) for the gods that all-pervading power (vikrânti) which now belongs to them; by his first step he gained this same (earth); by the second, the region of air; and by the last, <span id="p156"><sup><small>[ p. 156 ]</small></sup></span> the heaven. And that same pervading power Vish<i>n</i>u, the sacrifice, obtains by his strides for this (sacrificer) when he sacrifices: this is why he performs the Vaisar<i>g</i>ina offerings.

<span id="v3_6_3_44"><sup><small>3:6:3:44.</small></sup></span>  In the afternoon, having covered the altar (with sacrificial grass), and handed (to the sacrificer and his wife) one half of the fast-milk, they enter (the hall), put fire-wood on [^412], and prepare the under-layer (of gravel). He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the old Gârhapatya), and cleans the spoons. The sacrificer takes the king (Soma) on his lap. He (the Adhvaryu) scatters about the (dust of the) foot-print of the Soma-cow behind the (new) Gârhapatya for the sake of a firm standing, for it is with the foot that one stands firmly.

<span id="v3_6_3_55"><sup><small>3:6:3:55.</small></sup></span>  Now some divide it (the dust) into four parts [^413]: one fourth part (they put) into the under-layer whereon they take up the Âhavanîya (for transferring it to the high altar); with one fourth part they anoint the axle; one fourth part (they put) into this underlayer (for taking out the Âgnîdhrîya fire); and one fourth part he scatters about behind the Gârhapatya.

<span id="v3_6_3_66"><sup><small>3:6:3:66.</small></sup></span>  But let him not do this; let him rather scatter it about entirely behind the Gârhapatya. Having then purified the ghee, he takes thereof four ladlings (with the sruva), both in the <i>g</i>uhû and in the upabh<i>ri</i>t; and clotted ghee [^414] in five ladlings, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 35), <span id="p157"><sup><small>[ p. 157 ]</small></sup></span> ‘Thou art a light endowed with all forms, the flame of the All-gods;’ for the clotted ghee belongs to the All-gods. When the wood is well kindled, they hold the spoons for him.

<span id="v3_6_3_77"><sup><small>3:6:3:77.</small></sup></span>  He then offers [^415], with, ‘Thou, O Soma, wilt widely withhold thy protection from the life-injuring [^416] hatreds put forth by others, Hail!’ Thereby he takes a firm stand on this resting-place, the earth, and gains this world.

<span id="v3_6_3_88"><sup><small>3:6:3:88.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the second oblation to (Soma) the Nimble, with, ‘May the Nimble graciously accept the butter, Hail!’ For he (Soma) spake upon that time, ‘Verily I am afraid of the Rakshas: do ye make me to be too small for their deadly shaft, so that the evil spirits (the Rakshas) shall not injure me on the way; and take me across in the form of a drop, for the drop is nimble.’ And accordingly, having made him too small for the deadly shaft, they lead him safely across in the form of a drop, from fear of the Rakshas, for the drop is nimble: this is why he offers the second oblation to (Soma) the Nimble.

<span id="v3_6_3_99"><sup><small>3:6:3:99.</small></sup></span>  They lift the (burning) fire-wood, and place it on the support. He then says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite for Agni, taken forward!’ or (say some), ‘—for Soma, led forward.’ But let him say, ‘Recite for Agni, taken forward [^417]!’ <span id="p158"><sup><small>[ p. 158 ]</small></sup></span> 3:6:3:1010\. They take the pressing-stones, the Soma-trough (dro<i>n</i>a-kala<i>s</i>a); Vâyu's cups [^418], the (twenty pieces of) fire-wood, the enclosing-sticks of kârshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea), one prastara of a<i>s</i>vavâla grass [^419], and the two Vidh<i>ri</i>tis of sugarcane; that barhis (which was used before [^420]) is tied up therewith. Further, the two spits for (roasting) the omenta [^421], the two ropes (for binding the stake and victims), the two churning-sticks (for producing fire), the adhimanthana chip, and the two v<i>ri</i>sha<i>n</i>a [^422],—having taken up all these they go forward (to the Âgnîdhra): thus the sacrifice goes upwards [^423].

<span id="v3_6_3_1111"><sup><small>3:6:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  While they proceed thither, he makes (the sacrificer) say the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 36; Rig-veda I, 189, 1), ‘O Agni, lead us on a good path unto wealth, thou, O God, that knowest all works! keep thou from us the sin that leadeth astray, and we will offer unto thee most ample adoration!’ He thereby places Agni in front, and Agni marches in front repelling the evil spirits; and they take him thither on a (way) free from danger and <span id="p159"><sup><small>[ p. 159 ]</small></sup></span> injury. They proceed, and reach the Âgnîdhra; and he (the Adhvaryu) puts (the fire) down on the Âgnîdhra hearth.

<span id="v3_6_3_1212"><sup><small>3:6:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  Thereon, when laid down, he offers with the text (Vas. S. V, 37), ‘May this Agni make wide room for us; may he march in front smiting the haters! May he gain riches in the winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing, conquer the enemies, Hail!’ By means of him (Agni) he thus takes a firm stand in that resting-place, the aerial region, and gains that world.

<span id="v3_6_3_1313"><sup><small>3:6:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  In the same place they deposit the pressing-stones, the Soma-trough, and Vâyu's cups [^424]. Having then taken up the other (objects), they proceed and deposit them north of the Âhavanîya.

<span id="v3_6_3_1414"><sup><small>3:6:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water, and sprinkles first the fire-wood, and then the altar. They then hand to him the altar-grass. He puts it down with the knot towards the east, and sprinkles it. Having poured (the remaining sprinkling-water) upon (the root ends of the altar-grass), and untied the knot,—the Prastara-hunch of a<i>s</i>vavâla grass is tied together (with the altar-grass),—he takes that; and having taken the Prastara, he spreads the altar-grass in a single layer. Having spread the altar-grass, he lays the enclosing-sticks of kârshmarya-wood round (the fire). Having laid the enclosing-sticks around, he puts two kindling-sticks (on the fire); and having put on the two kindling-sticks,

<span id="v3_6_3_1515"><sup><small>3:6:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  He offers with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V., 38), ‘Stride thou widely, O Vish<i>n</i>u, make wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee, <span id="p160"><sup><small>[ p. 160 ]</small></sup></span> and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards, Hail!’ Thereby he takes a firm stand in that resting-place, the sky: he thus gains that world by offering with that (verse).

<span id="v3_6_3_1616"><sup><small>3:6:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  And as to his offering with a verse addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u, it was thus that they made him (Soma) to be too small for the deadly shaft and led him safely across in the form of a drop, for the drop is nimble. And having attained to safety, he now makes him the one he really is, namely, the sacrifice, for Vish<i>n</i>u is the sacrifice: therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u.

<span id="v3_6_3_1717"><sup><small>3:6:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  After depositing the spoons [^425] and touching water, he makes the king (Soma) enter (the Havirdhâna shed). The reason why he makes the king enter, after depositing the spoons and touching water, is this. The ghee is the thunderbolt, and Soma is seed: hence it is after depositing the spoons and touching water that he makes the king enter, lest he should injure the seed Soma with the thunderbolt, the ghee.

<span id="v3_6_3_1818"><sup><small>3:6:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  He spreads the black deer-skin on the enclosed part of the southern Soma-cart, and sets him down thereon with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 39), ‘O divine Savit<i>ri</i>, this is thy Soma: shield him; may they not injure thee!’ whereby he makes him over to the God Savit<i>ri</i> for protection.

<span id="v3_6_3_1919"><sup><small>3:6:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  Having quitted his hold of him, he (the sacrificer) renders homage to him with, ‘Now, O divine Soma, hast thou, a god, joined the gods, and <span id="p161"><sup><small>[ p. 161 ]</small></sup></span> here I the men with increase of wealth.’ Now Agni and Soma have seized him who consecrates himself between their jaws [^426], for that consecration-offering belongs to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, and Vish<i>n</i>u forsooth is no other than Soma; and he himself that consecrates himself is the food of the gods: thus they have seized him between their jaws, and he now expressly redeems himself from Soma, when he says, ‘Now, O divine Soma, hast thou, a god, joined the gods, and here (have I joined) the men with increase of wealth;’—increase of wealth means abundance: ‘with abundance’ he thereby means to say.

<span id="v3_6_3_2020"><sup><small>3:6:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  He then walks out (of the cart-shed), with, 'Hail! I am freed from Varu<i>n</i>a's noose!' For he, truly, is in Varu<i>n</i>a's noose who is in another's mouth: he now frees himself from Varu<i>n</i>a's noose, when he says, 'Hail! I am freed from Varu<i>n</i>a's noose.’

<span id="v3_6_3_2121"><sup><small>3:6:3:2121.</small></sup></span>  He then puts a kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya in this way [^427], ‘O Agni, protector of vows, on thee, O protector of vows—’ for Agni is lord of vows to the gods, wherefore he says, ‘O Agni, protector of vows, on thee, O protector of vows’—‘what bodily form of thine hath been on me, (may) that (be) on thee; what bodily form of mine has been on thee, (may) that (be) here on me! Our vows, O lord of vows, (have been performed) rightly: the lord of consecration hath <span id="p162"><sup><small>[ p. 162 ]</small></sup></span> approved my consecration; the lord of penance hath approved my penance.’ Thereby he frees himself visibly from Agni, and sacrifices with a self (body) now his own: hence they now partake of his food, for he is a man (again); hence they now use his (real) name, for he is a man. And as to their not eating (of his food) heretofore, it is as one would not eat of sacrificial food, before offering has been made thereof: therefore let no one partake of the food of one consecrated. He now loosens his fingers.

### THE ANIMAL SACRIFICE [^428] TO AGNI AND SOMA.

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

#### A. THE SETTING UP OF THE SACRIFICIAL STAKE.

<span id="v3_6_4_11"><sup><small>3:6:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Being about to cut the sacrificial stake, he offers [^429] with a verse addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u. For the stake belongs to Vish<i>n</i>u; therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u.

<span id="v3_6_4_22"><sup><small>3:6:4:22.</small></sup></span>  And again, why he offers with a verse addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u—Vish<i>n</i>u being the sacrifice, he thus approaches the stake by means of the sacrifice: therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u.

<span id="v3_6_4_33"><sup><small>3:6:4:33.</small></sup></span>  If he offers with the offering-spoon, he offers after taking ghee by four ladlings; and if he offers with the dipping-spoon, he offers after ‘cutting out’ (some ghee from the pot) with the dipping-spoon,—with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 41), ‘Stride thou widely, <span id="p163"><sup><small>[ p. 163 ]</small></sup></span> O Vish<i>n</i>u, make wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee, and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards! Hail!’

<span id="v3_6_4_44"><sup><small>3:6:4:44.</small></sup></span>  He takes the ghee which is left (in the melting-pot). Whatever chopping-knife the carpenter uses, that the carpenter now takes. They then proceed (to the wood). Whatever (tree) they select for the stake,

<span id="v3_6_4_55"><sup><small>3:6:4:55.</small></sup></span>  That he touches while muttering (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 42),—or he salutes it while standing behind it with his face towards the east,—‘I have passed over the others, I have not gone nigh the others—’ he does indeed pass over others and does not go near to others: wherefore he says, ‘I have passed over the others, I have not gone nigh the others.’

<span id="v3_6_4_66"><sup><small>3:6:4:66.</small></sup></span>  ‘Thee have I found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the farther side of the nearer;’ he does indeed fell it on the nearer side of the farther, of those that are farther away from it; and ‘on the farther side of the nearer,’ he says, because he does fell it on the farther side of the nearer, of those that are on this side of it. This is why he says, ‘Thee have I found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the farther side of the nearer.’

<span id="v3_6_4_77"><sup><small>3:6:4:77.</small></sup></span>  ‘Thee do we favour, O divine lord of the forest [^430], for the worship of the gods.’ As for the good work, he would favour (select) one from amidst many (men) and he (the chosen) would be well-disposed to that work, even so does he now, for the good work, favour that (tree) from amidst many, and it becomes well-disposed to the felling. <span id="p164"><sup><small>[ p. 164 ]</small></sup></span> 3:6:4:88\. ‘Thee may the gods favour for the worship of the gods!’ for that is truly successful which the gods favour for the good work: therefore he says, ‘Thee may the gods favour for the worship of the gods!’

<span id="v3_6_4_99"><sup><small>3:6:4:99.</small></sup></span>  He then touches it with the dipping-spoon, with, ‘For Vish<i>n</i>u, thee!’ for the stake belongs to Vish<i>n</i>u, since Vish<i>n</i>u is the sacrifice, and he fells this (tree) for the sacrifice: therefore he says, ‘For Vish<i>n</i>u, thee!’

<span id="v3_6_4_1010"><sup><small>3:6:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then places a blade of darbha-grass between [^431], with, ‘O plant, shield it!’ for the axe is a thunderbolt; but thus that thunderbolt, the axe, does not hurt it (the tree). He then strikes with the axe, with, ‘O axe, hurt it not!’ for the axe is a thunderbolt, but thus that thunderbolt, the axe, does not hurt it.

<span id="v3_6_4_1111"><sup><small>3:6:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  The first chip [^432] which he cuts off, he takes (and lays aside). Let him cut (the tree) so as to cause no obstruction to the axle [^433]. For, indeed, it is on a cart that they convey it, and in this way he does not obstruct the cart. <span id="p165"><sup><small>[ p. 165 ]</small></sup></span> 3:6:4:1212\. Let him cut it so as to fall towards the east, for the east is the quarter of the gods; or towards the north, for the north is the quarter of men; or towards the west. But let him take care to keep it from (falling towards) the southern quarter, for that is the quarter of the Fathers: therefore he must take care to keep it from the southern quarter.

<span id="v3_6_4_1313"><sup><small>3:6:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  The falling (tree) he addresses with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V; 43), ‘Graze not the sky! hurt not the air! unite with the earth!’ for verily that (tree) which they cut for the stake is a thunderbolt, and these worlds tremble for fear of that falling thunderbolt; but he thereby propitiates it for these worlds, and thus propitiated it injures not these worlds.

<span id="v3_6_4_1414"><sup><small>3:6:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  Now when he says, ‘Graze not the sky,’ he means to say, ‘Injure not the sky!’ In the words ‘hurt not the air’ there is nothing obscure. By ‘Unite with the earth,’ he means to say, ‘Be thou in harmony with the earth!’ ‘For this sharp-edged axe hath led thee forward unto great bliss,’ for this sharp axe indeed leads it forward.

<span id="v3_6_4_1515"><sup><small>3:6:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  Upon the stump he then offers ghee, ‘lest the evil spirits should rise therefrom after (the tree):’ ghee being a thunderbolt, he thus repels the evil spirits by means of the thunderbolt, and thus the evil spirits do not rise therefrom after it. And ghee being seed, he thus endows the trees with that seed; and from that seed (in) the stump trees are afterwards produced [^434].

<span id="v3_6_4_1616"><sup><small>3:6:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  He sacrifices with, ‘Grow thou out of this, O lord of the forest, with a hundred shoots! <span id="p166"><sup><small>[ p. 166 ]</small></sup></span> May we grow out with a thousand shoots!’ There is nothing obscure in this.

<span id="v3_6_4_1717"><sup><small>3:6:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he cuts it (the stake of the proper length): of whatever length he cuts it the first time, so long let it remain.

<span id="v3_6_4_1818"><sup><small>3:6:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  He may cut it five cubits long; for fivefold is the sacrifice and fivefold is the animal (victim), and five seasons there are in the year: therefore he may cut it five cubits long.

<span id="v3_6_4_1919"><sup><small>3:6:4:1919.</small></sup></span>  He may cut it six cubits long; for six seasons there are in the year; and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it six cubits long.

<span id="v3_6_4_2020"><sup><small>3:6:4:2020.</small></sup></span>  He may cut it eight cubits long, (for eight syllables has the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as the sacrificial stake is the fore-part of the sacrifice: therefore he may cut it eight cubits long.

<span id="v3_6_4_2121"><sup><small>3:6:4:2121.</small></sup></span>  He may cut it nine cubits long, for threefold is the sacrifice, and ‘nine’ is threefold: therefore he may cut it nine cubits long.

<span id="v3_6_4_2222"><sup><small>3:6:4:2222.</small></sup></span>  He may cut it eleven cubits long, for eleven syllables has the Trish<i>t</i>ubh, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it eleven cubits long.

<span id="v3_6_4_2323"><sup><small>3:6:4:2323.</small></sup></span>  He may cut it twelve cubits long, for twelve months there are in the year, and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it twelve cubits long.

<span id="v3_6_4_2424"><sup><small>3:6:4:2424.</small></sup></span>  He may cut it thirteen cubits long, for thirteen months there are in a year, and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it thirteen cubits long.

<span id="v3_6_4_2525"><sup><small>3:6:4:2525.</small></sup></span>  He may cut it fifteen cubits long, for the <span id="p167"><sup><small>[ p. 167 ]</small></sup></span> fifteen-versed chant is a thunderbolt [^435], as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it fifteen cubits long.

<span id="v3_6_4_2626"><sup><small>3:6:4:2626.</small></sup></span>  The sacrificial stake of the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya sacrifice is seventeen cubits long. Indeed, it may be unmeasured [^436], for with that same unmeasured thunderbolt did the gods conquer the unmeasured; and in like manner does he now conquer the unmeasured with that unmeasured thunderbolt: therefore it may even be unmeasured.

<span id="v3_6_4_2727"><sup><small>3:6:4:2727.</small></sup></span>  It is (made to be) eight-cornered, for eight syllables has the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as this (stake) is the forepart of the sacrifice: therefore it is eight-cornered.

## Footnotes

[^380]: 140:3 The Sadas is a shed or tent, facing the east with its long side, which is to measure eighteen (or twenty-one, or twenty-four, or, according to the <i>S</i>ulva-sûtra, twenty-seven) cubits, the breadth by p. 141 six cubits (or ten, or one half that of the long side). The udumbara post, according to some, is to stand exactly in the centre of the shed; or, according to others, at an equal distance from the (long) east and west sides; the ‘spine’ (cf. [p. 112](../Book_2_3_5#p112), note [2](../Book_2_3_5#fn294)) in that case dividing the building into two equal parts, a northern and a southern one. In the middle the shed is to be of the sacrificer's height, and from thence the ceiling is to slant towards the ends where it is to reach up to the sacrificer's navel. According to the Black Ya<i>g</i>us, the erection of the Sadas precedes the digging of the Uparavas, described in the preceding Brâhma<i>n</i>a. Taitt. S. VI, 2, 10, 11.

[^381]: 141:1 The anta<i>h</i>pâta, see [III, 5, I, 1](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_1_1).

[^382]: 142:1 It is the part which is to stand above ground that is to be of the sacrificer's size.

[^383]: 143:1 Svâru<i>h</i>, ‘naturally grown,’ Taitt. S. VI, 2, 10, 4.

[^384]: 144:1 See [III, 5, 2, 11](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_2_11) with note. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has, bahvî vâ â<i>s</i>îr ya<i>g</i>u<i>h</i>shu te asmâ ete â<i>s</i>ishâ vâ <i>s</i>âste yad brahma <i>k</i>a kshatra<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a.

[^385]: 145:1 The post is to be furcate at the top, and between the branch-stumps (forming as it were its ears) he is to put a piece of gold and pour the ghee thereon; when the ghee reaches the ground, he is to pronounce the final ‘Svâhâ!’ in accordance with the practice at the homas; the gold representing, as it were, the sacrificial fire. Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. I, 3, I; Kâty. VIII, 5, 37 seq.

[^386]: 145:2 That is, after putting up the posts of the front and back doors, and laying the beams on, both longways and crossways, in the same way as was done in erecting the Prâ<i>k</i>înava<i>m</i><i>s</i>a and Havirdhâna, he is to spread over the beams the nine mats that are to form the ceiling,—viz. first the middle, and then the two others, of the three southern ones, thereupon three alongside these, across the central part of the shed, and finally the three across the north side. According to some authorities the central mats are laid down first, and then those on the south and north sides. See Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. I, 3, 1 (p. 450).

[^387]: 146:1 Viz. with hurdles, or upright grass-mats, fastened to the doorposts by means of cord.

[^388]: 146:2 See [III, 5, 3, 25](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_3_25).

[^389]: 147:1 North of the clog (apalamba) of the carts, Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^390]: 147:2 They gained it, as would seem, by means of the other half of the Âgnîdhra fire. Cf. Ait. Br. II, 36. Sâya<i>n</i>a interprets ‘tân apy ardham âgnîdhrasya, <i>g</i>igyus’ by, ‘\[They forced those (gods) back to the Sadas:\] and they (the gods), having reached the side (ardham = samîpam) of the Âgnîdhra (fire), conquered the Asuras and won immortality.’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va rec. reads:—‘Te hâpy âgnîdhrasyârdha<i>m</i> <i>g</i>igyus to ’rdhân (! read ’rdhâd) etad vi<i>s</i>ve devâ am<i>ri</i>tatvam apâ<i>g</i>ayan.’

[^391]: 148:1 Or, as Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it, ‘he who is known (as well-conducted) and a repeater (reader) of the Veda.’

[^392]: 148:2 See [IV, 3, 4, 19](../Book_2_4_3#v4_3_4_19) seq.

[^393]: 148:3 Or, ‘that (fire) will not suffer evil’ (ârti<i>m</i> na labheta, Sâya<i>n</i>a).

[^394]: 148:4 There are altogether eight dhish<i>n</i>yas, two of which, viz. the Âgnîdhra and the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya, are raised north and south of the back part of the cart-shed (havirdhâna) respectively; while the other six are raised inside the Sadas along the east side of it, viz. five of them north of the ‘spine,’ belonging (from south to north) to the Hot<i>ri</i>, Brâhma<i>n</i>â_kh<i>a</i>m_si, Pot<i>ri</i>, Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, and A<i>kh</i>âvâka respectively; and one south of the spine, exactly south-east of the Udumbara post, for the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a (or Pra<i>s</i>âst<i>ri</i>) priest. These six priests, together with the Âgnîdhra, are called the ‘seven Hot<i>ri</i>s.’ The Âgnîdhra and Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya have square sheds with four posts erected over them, open on the east side and on the side facing the cart-shed. The Âgnîdhra hearth is thrown up first, and the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya last of all; and the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's immediately after that of the Hot<i>ri</i>. For the formulas by which they are consecrated, see Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 32, 32.

[^395]: 149:1 That is, the parts of the body corresponding to one another, as arms, loins, &c.

[^396]: 149:2 See [III, 2, 4, 1](../Book_2_3_2#v3_2_4_1) seq.; Oldenberg, Zeitsch. d. Deutsch. Morg. Ges. XXXVII, p. 67 seq.; Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 31.

[^397]: 149:3 In Taitt. S. VI, 1, 6; Kâ<i>th</i>. XXIII, 10, supar<i>n</i>î, ‘the well-winged,’ is identified with the sky.

[^398]: 149:4 Lit. ‘she shall win both of us,’ i.e. each saying that the other would win herself.

[^399]: 150:1 ‘And because these two there disputed, therefore the story called “Saupar<i>n</i>akâdrava” is here told,’ Kâ<i>n</i>va text. It is difficult to see how this statement came to be inserted here, unless it be because of a division in the text,—this paragraph being the nineteen hundredth in the Mâdhyandina recension. This explanation would not, however, apply to the Kâ<i>n</i>va text.

[^400]: 150:2 ‘Therewith redeem thee from death,’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^401]: 150:3 Ku<i>s</i>î? = ko<i>s</i>î, ‘pod’ (or case). Sâya<i>n</i>a explains it by ‘âyudha’ (? weapon, or vessel. sheath).

[^402]: 151:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it in the sense of ‘she swallowed (khâd),’ but I should feel inclined to refer it to the same verb ‘khid’ (? khad) as ‘âkhidat’ coming immediately after it. Could Pâ<i>n</i>ini's Sûtra VI, 1, 52 refer to this passage? \[Kâ<i>s</i>. V., Benares edition <i>k</i>ikhâda; MS. Indian Office <i>k</i>akhâda.\] The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has the same reading: â<i>k</i>akhâda-âkhidat.

[^403]: 152:1 See [III, 3, 3, 11](../Book_2_3_3#v3_3_3_11).

[^404]: 152:2 For these oblations poured upon burning bundles of chips and grass held over the several hearth-fires, see [IV, 4, 2, 7](../Book_2_4_4#v4_4_2_7).

[^405]: 152:3 Yad vâ uparyupari somam bibhrata<i>h</i> sa<i>m</i><i>k</i>arishyanti, Kâ<i>n</i>va rec. (? holding the Soma close above the dhish<i>n</i>yas). This passage p. 153 apparently refers to the <i>K</i>amasa-Adhvaryus or cup-bearers, who at the time of the Savanas hold up their cups filled with Soma, which, after libations have been made of it on the fire, is drunk by the priests.

[^406]: 153:1 Samayâ; the Kâ<i>n</i>va text has ‘pratyaṅ (in going to the back)’ instead.

[^407]: 153:2 That is, bestrewed with gravel.

[^408]: 153:3 When the dhish<i>n</i>yas have been completed, the Adhvaryu, standing east of the front door of the Sadas, has to point at the Âhavanîya, the Bahishpavamâna-place, the pit whence the earth for the hearths and high altar was taken, the slaughtering place, the Udumbara post, the Brahman's seat, the (old Âhavanîya at the) hall-door, the old Gârhapatya, and the Utkara (heap of rubbish) one by one with the texts, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 32, 2, &c. Kâty. VIII, 6, 23, 24.

[^409]: 154:1 Nârâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa, 'pertaining to Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa (man's praise, i.e. Agni, or Soma, or the Fathers),' is the name given to certain remains of Soma-libations (or potations) sacred to the Fathers, which, in the nine Soma-cups, are temporarily deposited under the axle of the southern Soma-cart, till they are drunk by the priests at the end of the libation.

[^410]: 154:2 Or, alongside of; corresponding to, included in, them (anu).

[^411]: 155:1 ‘Sma’ does not seem here to nave its usual force, which it has in the next sentence, combined with ‘purâ.’

[^412]: 155:2 Or, corresponds to (anu).

[^413]: 155:3 That is, a blood-relation of the sacrificer, dwelling together with him. Cf. also [p. 40](../Book_2_3_2#p40), note [1](../Book_2_3_2#fn111).

[^414]: 156:1 Viz. on the Âhavanîya of the Prâ<i>k</i>înava<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (hall) now serving as the Gârhapatya, and generally called <i>s</i>âlâdvârya, i.e. the one near the (front or eastern) hall-door.

[^415]: 156:2 See [p. 121](../Book_2_3_5#p121), note [2](../Book_2_3_5#fn322).

[^416]: 156:3 P<i>ri</i>shad-â<i>g</i>ya (lit. mottled butter) is clarified butter mixed with sour milk.

[^417]: 157:1 He offers some ghee from a substitute spoon (pra<i>k</i>aranî), as the proper offering-spoons now filled with ghee and clotted ghee have to be carried with the fire to the Âgnîdhra.

[^418]: 157:2 Mahîdhara explains ‘tanûk<i>ri</i>t’ by ‘tanû<i>m</i> k<i>ri</i>ntanti <i>k</i>indanti.’ It ought rather to mean ‘body-making,’—? from ‘the enemies that assume (various) forms.’

[^419]: 157:3 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text, on the contrary, enjoins that he is to say, ‘Recite for Soma . . .!’ In the Hot<i>ri</i>'s ritual this is called the p. 158 Agnîshoma-pra<i>n</i>ayana. For the seventeen verses (brought up to twenty-one by repetitions) of the Hot<i>ri</i>, see Ait. Br. I, 30 (Haug, Translation, p. 68); Â<i>s</i>v. IV, 10. The Soma is carried either by the Brahman himself or by the sacrificer. Kâty. XI, 1, 13, 14.

[^420]: 158:1 The ‘Vâyavya’ are wooden cups shaped like a mortar. It seems here to include all the Soma-cups, see IV, 1, 3, 7-10; Kâty, VIII, 7, 5.

[^421]: 158:2 See [III, 4, 1, 17](../Book_2_3_4#v3_4_1_17)\-[18](../Book_2_3_4#v3_4_1_18).

[^422]: 158:3 Viz. at the guest-offering, see [p. 103](../Book_2_3_4#p103), note [3](../Book_2_3_4#fn269). It was tied up with the three objects mentioned immediately before.

[^423]: 158:4 The vapâ<i>s</i>rapa<i>n</i>î are sticks of kârshmarya wood.

[^424]: 158:5 For these objects, see [p. 90](../Book_2_3_4#p90), note [5](../Book_2_3_4#fn241).

[^425]: 158:6 ‘Thus that sacrifice goes upwards to yonder heavenly world, and, the sacrifice being the sacrificer, the sacrificer thus goes thither,’ Kâ<i>n</i>va text. See [III, 6, 1, 28](../Book_2_3_6#v3_6_1_28), where the gods are said to have attained immortality from the Âgnîdhrîya.

[^426]: 159:1 Also the two fringed filtering-cloths (da<i>s</i>âpavitre), according to the Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^427]: 160:1 ‘He then deposits the Prastara on the mound ([p. 140](../Book_2_3_5#p140), note [2](../Book_2_3_5#fn377)), deposits there the <i>g</i>uhû and the upabh<i>ri</i>t and the p<i>ri</i>shadâ<i>g</i>ya; and having touched the sacrificial materials and touched water, he takes the king and enters (the cart-shed),’ &c. Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.

[^428]: 161:1 See [III, 3, 4, 21](../Book_2_3_3#v3_3_4_21).

[^429]: 161:2 Thus (iti), viz. with the following modifications of the corresponding formula, used at the ‘intermediary consecration,’ [III, 4, 3, 9](../Book_2_3_4#v3_4_3_9). Perhaps ‘iti’ may mean ‘thus,’ i.e. while still keeping his fingers turned in; or, it may mean ‘as such’ (as a free man).

[^430]: 162:1 On the Animal Sacrifice, cp. Dr. J. Schwab's dissertation, ‘Das altindische Thieropfer,’ 1882.

[^431]: 162:2 This oblation is called yûpâhuti, or ‘stake-offering.’

[^432]: 163:1 ‘Vanaspati’ is a common synonym of v<i>ri</i>ksha, tree.

[^433]: 164:1 Viz. he places or holds it against where he is about to strike the tree, so as first to cut the grass.

[^434]: 164:2 For the destination of this chip of the bark, see [III, 7, 1, 8](../Book_2_3_7#v3_7_1_8).

[^435]: 164:3 That is to say, he is not to cut the tree too high from the ground, so that the axle of the cart might readily pass over the remaining stump without touching it. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, ‘tam anakshastambhe v<i>ri</i><i>s</i><i>k</i>ed uta hy enam anasâ vakshyanto bhavanty uto svarga<i>m</i> hâsya loka<i>m</i> yate (sic) ’kshastambha<i>h</i> syât tasmâd anakshastambhe v<i>ri</i><i>s</i><i>k</i>et.’ Nothing is said anywhere about the yûpa being conveyed on a cart to the sacrificial ground, if, indeed, that statement refer to the yûpa at all. Sâya<i>n</i>a's comment is very corrupt here, but he seems to interpret the passage to the effect that some people might convey the stake on the cart (pakshe anasâ yûpa<i>m</i> nayeyu<i>h</i>) and that in that case the cart would be obstructed.

[^436]: 165:1 Or, ‘hence trees grow up again from the stump (? after felling, “â vra<i>s</i><i>k</i>anât”) out of seed.’

[^437]: 167:1 On the connection of the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a-stoma with Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, see part i, introduction, p. xviii.

[^438]: 167:2 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text leaves an option first between stakes six, eight, eleven, fifteen (and for the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya seventeen) cubits long; and finally lays down the rule that no regard is to be had to any fixed measure.
