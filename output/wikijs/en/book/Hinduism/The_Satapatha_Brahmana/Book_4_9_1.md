NINTH KÂ<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

#### THE BUILDING OF THE SACRED FIRE-ALTAR

####(continued).

####<i>S</i>ATARUDRIYA LUSTRATION, INSTALMENT AND CONSECRATION OF FIRE, AND SOMA-SACRIFICE.

## FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### THE SATARUDRIYA.

THIS solemn and awful ceremony consists of 425 oblations to Rudra, the representative of the fearful aspects of life and nature, accompanied by appropriate formulas addressed to the various forms of the terrible god, and his associates, with a view to appeasing their wrath. These formulas make up a complete kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a (XVI) of the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-sa<i>m</i>hitâ, and constitute a special Upanishad. Though only a few of the formulas are actually referred to in the text of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the different portions of which this dismal litany consists are otherwise alluded to, and for this reason, as well as on account of its intrinsic interest, as doubtless reflecting, to a considerable extent, the popular belief in demoniac agencies to which man is constantly exposed, a complete translation of the <i>S</i>atarudriya formulas is here given. For a German translation of the Taittirîya recension of the text, with the various readings of the Kâ<i>th</i>aka and Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyin versions, see A. Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 14 seqq.

I. 1. Reverence, O Rudra, be to thy wrath; and to thine arrow be reverence; and to both thine arms be reverence! 2. What auspicious form there is of thine, free from terror and boding of evil, with that most propitious form look down upon us, O mountain-dweller! 3. The shaft thou bearest in thy hand to hurl, O mountain-dweller, make it harmless, O protector of mountains, injure not man nor beast! 4. With auspicious speech we call upon thee, O mountain-dweller, that all these living beings of ours may <span id="p151">[<sup><small>p. 151</small></sup>]</span> be healthy and of good cheer! 5. May he plead for us as our intercessor, the first divine physician: crushing all serpents, turn thou aside all practices of witchcraft! 6. That tawny one, and the ruddy and the brown one, the auspicious—the Rudras that hover around him by thousands in the quarters: their wrath do we deprecate. 7. That one who glideth downwards (the sun) blood-red and blue-necked—the cowherds have seen him and the water-bearers (f. the clouds) have seen him—be he gracious unto us, when seen! 8. Reverence be to the blue-necked, thousand-eyed showerer; and what henchmen there are of his, to them do I render homage. 9. Loose thou the string from the ends of thy bow; and cast away the arrows in thy hand, O holy one! 10. Stringless be the bow of the coil-braided one, and arrowless his quiver! may his arrows be futile, axed empty his scabbard! 11. With that plague-repelling weapon in thy hand, with thy bow, protect us, O best of showerers, on all sides! 12. May the shaft of thy bow spare us on all sides, and far from us lay down that quiver of thine! 13. Unstringing the bow, and breaking off the points of thy shafts, be thou gracious and well-disposed unto us, O thousand-eyed lord of a hundred quivers! 14. Reverence be to thine unstrung weapon, the powerful one; and reverence be to thine arms and to thy bow! 15. Neither our full-grown, nor our little one, neither the virile, nor the unborn, neither our father strike thou, nor our mother: harm not our dear bodies, O Rudra! 16. Neither to our children, and our children's children, nor to our life, neither to our kine nor to our horses do thou injury! smite not our shining warriors: with offering we ever invoke thee, O Rudra!

Reverence be to the onward-rushing one with his (weapon) levelled everywhere, and to the lord of beings be reverence! reverence be to the victorious smiter, and to the lord of victorious (hosts) be reverence! reverence be to the matchless swordsman, and to the lord of thieves be reverence! reverence be to the prowling rover, and to the lord of the forest be reverence! 21.

Reverence be to him of the coiled hair and to the shaven-haired one! reverence be to the thousand-eyed and to the hundred-bowed one! reverence be to the mountain-dweller and to the bald one! reverence be to the chief of showerers and to the arrow-shooter! 30.

Reverence be to the swift and agile one! reverence be to the fast and nimble one! reverence be to the surging and roaring one! reverence be to the river-dweller and the isle-dweller!

V. 32. Reverence be to the eldest and to the youngest! reverence be to the firstborn and to the afterborn! reverence be to the middlemost and to the abortive (?) one! reverence be to the hindmost and to the bottommost one! 33. Reverence be to him dwelling in the air-castles, and to him in the magic cord-ring! reverence he to him who is in Yama's (death's) power, and to him who liveth in safety! reverence be to him in (the height of his) fame, and to him who is at his end! reverence be to him on the tilled land, and to him on the threshing-floor! 34.

IX. 47. Chaser, lord of the (Soma) plant! blue-red cleaver! fright and hurt not these people and these cattle: let none of us sicken! 48. These prayers we bring before the mighty Rudra, the coil-braided miter of heroes, that there may be safety for the two-footed and the four-footed, and that everything in this village may be healthy and thriving. 49. That friendly form of thine, O Rudra, friendly and ever healing, friendly and healing to the stricken: therewith be gracious unto us that we may live! 50. May the shaft of Rudra spare us, and the ill-will of the violent and malevolent <span id="p155">[<sup><small>p. 155</small></sup>]</span> one: unstring the strong (bow) from (hurting) our patrons, O showerer (of gifts), and be gracious unto our children and our children's children! 51. Be thou kindly _and_ well-disposed towards us, O kindliest chief of showerers, lay down thy weapon on the highest tree, and putting on the hide come and join us, bearing the spear! 52. O blood-red scatterer, reverence be unto thee, holy one, let those thousand shafts of thine lay low another than us! 53. The thousandfold thousand shafts of thine arms—turn thou away their heads from us, O holy lord! 54. What countless thousands of Rudras there are upon earth, their bows do we unstring (and cast away) at a thousand leagues. 55. The Bhavas in this great sea, the air: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 56. The blue-necked, white-throated Rudras seated in the sky: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 57. The blue-necked, white-throated <i>S</i>arvas dwelling below the earth: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 58. The grass-green in the trees, the blue-necked, blood-red ones: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 59. They who are the chiefs of spirits, hairless and coil-braided: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 60. They who are the guardians of roads, food-bearers, life-fighters (?): their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 61. They who haunt the bathing-places, wielders of spear and sword: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 62. They who strike men at their meals, and in their cups those that drink: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 63. What Rudras are scattered over the regions, so many and more: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues.—64. Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in the sky, whose arrows the rain is! to them (I stretch) ten (fingers) eastward, ten southward, ten westward, ten northward, ten upward: to them be reverence! may they be gracious unto us and help us: whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their jaws! 65. Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in the air, whose arrows the wind is! to them (I stretch) ten (fingers) eastward, ten southward, ten westward, ten northward, ten upward: to them be reverence! may they be gracious unto us and help us: whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their jaws! 66. Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling upon earth, whose arrows food is! to them (I stretch) ten (fingers) eastward, ten southward, ten westward, ten northward, ten upward: to them be reverence! may they be gracious unto us and help us: whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their jaws! <span id="p156">[<sup><small>p. 156</small></sup>]</span> 9:1:1:11\. He then performs the <i>S</i>atarudriya offering! This whole Agni has now [^260] been completed: he now is the deity Rudra. Upon him the gods bestowed that highest form, immortality. Flaming he there stood longing for food. The gods were afraid of him lest he should hurt them.

<span id="v9_1_1_22"><sup><small>9:1:1:22.</small></sup></span>  They spake, ‘Let us gather together food for him: therewith we will appease him!’ They gathered for him that food, the <i>S</i>ântadevatya [^261], and thereby appeased him; and inasmuch as they thereby appeased (<i>s</i>am) the god (deva), it is called <i>S</i>ântadevatya;—<i>S</i>ântadevatya, doubtless, is here called mystically ‘<i>S</i>atarudriya [^262],’ for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this Sacrificer now bestow upon him that highest form, immortality. Flaming he there stands, longing for food. He gathers for him that food, the <i>S</i>ântadevatya, and thereby appeases him.

<span id="v9_1_1_33"><sup><small>9:1:1:33.</small></sup></span>  He offers wild sesamum seeds. He (Agni) grows when he is being built up: he grows for (the consumption) of every kind of food. And wild sesamum seeds represent both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the wild-growing: inasmuch as they are sesamum seeds they are a cultivated (kind of food), and inasmuch as they ripen on unploughed land they are wild-growing; he thus satisfies him with both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the wild-growing. <span id="p157">[<sup><small>p. 157</small></sup>]</span> 9:1:1:44\. He offers by means of an arka-leaf [^263],—the Arka-tree (Calotropis gigantea) is food: he thus gratifies him with food.

<span id="v9_1_1_55"><sup><small>9:1:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He offers on (three) enclosing-stones:—these enclosing-stones are the (three) Agnis; and thus it is over Agni himself that these oblations of his become offered.

<span id="v9_1_1_66"><sup><small>9:1:1:66.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he performs the <i>S</i>atarudriya offering. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati had become disjointed, the deities departed from him. Only one god did not leave him, to wit, Manyu (wrath): extended he remained within. He (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) cried, and the tears of him that fell down settled on Manyu. He became the hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra. And the other drops that fell down, spread over these worlds in countless numbers, by thousands; and inasmuch as they originated from crying (rud), they were called Rudras (roarers). That hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra, with his bow strung, and his arrow fitted to the string, was inspiring fear, being in quest of food. The gods were afraid of him.

<span id="v9_1_1_77"><sup><small>9:1:1:77.</small></sup></span>  They spake unto Pra<i>g</i>âpati ‘We are afraid of this one, lest he should hurt us!’ He spake, ‘Gather food for him, and appease him therewith!’ They gathered for him that food, the <i>S</i>atarudriya (offering), and thereby appeased him; and inasmuch as they thereby appeased (<i>s</i>am) the hundred-headed (<i>s</i>ata<i>s</i>îrsha) Rudra, it is called <i>S</i>ata<i>s</i>îrsharudra<i>s</i>amanîya,—and <i>s</i>ata<i>s</i>îrsharudra<i>s</i>amanîya, doubtless, is what <span id="p158">[<sup><small>p. 158</small></sup>]</span> they mystically call <i>S</i>atarudriya, for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now gather for him that food, the <i>S</i>atarudriya, and appease him thereby.

<span id="v9_1_1_88"><sup><small>9:1:1:88.</small></sup></span>  He offers gavedhukâ flour; for from the place where that deity lay disjointed, gavedhukâ plants (coix barbata) sprang forth: he thus gratifies him by his own portion, by his own life-sap.

<span id="v9_1_1_99"><sup><small>9:1:1:99.</small></sup></span>  He offers by means of an arka-leaf; for that tree sprang from the resting-place of that god: he thus gratifies him by his own portion, by his own life-sap.

<span id="v9_1_1_1010"><sup><small>9:1:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  He offers on (three) enclosing-stones [^264], for the enclosing-stones are the hair, and neither poison nor anything else injures one at the hair. He offers whilst standing on the left (north) side of Agni (the altar), with his face to the north; for in that region lies the house of that god [^265]: it is thus in his own region that he gratifies him, in his own region he contents him with offering.

<span id="v9_1_1_1111"><sup><small>9:1:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  The first Svâhâ (‘hail’) he utters on the knee-high one,—-what is knee-high is, as it were, below, and below, as it were, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered this world.

<span id="v9_1_1_1212"><sup><small>9:1:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  Then on the navel-high one,—what is navel-high <span id="p159">[<sup><small>p. 159</small></sup>]</span> is, as it were, the middle; and the middle, as it were, is the air-world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered the air-world.

<span id="v9_1_1_1313"><sup><small>9:1:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  Then on the one reaching up to the mouth,—what reaches up to the mouth is, as it were, above, and above, as it were, is yonder world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered yonder world. \[He does so\] with Svâhâ,—the Svâhâ is food: with food he thus gratifies them.

<span id="v9_1_1_1414"><sup><small>9:1:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 1\], ‘Reverence, O Rudra, be to thy wrath!’ he thereby does reverence to that wrath which remained extended within him;—‘And to thine arrow be reverence, and to both thine arms be reverence!’ for it was by his arrow and his arms that he was inspiring fear.

<span id="v9_1_1_1515"><sup><small>9:1:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  That god who became the hundred-headed (Rudra) is the chief (kshatra [^266]), and those others who originated from the drops are the peasants (clansmen): those peasants in the first place assigned to that chief this as his special share, to wit, this first chapter of formulas [^267], and gratified him thereby. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now assign this to him as his special fore-share, and gratify him thereby. Hence this (section) is addressed to a single deity, to Rudra; for it is him he thereby gratifies.

<span id="v9_1_1_1616"><sup><small>9:1:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  There are here fourteen formulas,—thirteen months are a year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the fourteenth; <span id="p160">[<sup><small>p. 160</small></sup>]</span> and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Agni: as great as Agni is as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him. ‘Reverence! reverence!’ he says;—reverence being sacrifice, it is by sacrifice, by reverence, that he thus reveres him. Therefore he must not mention any one unworthy of sacrifice, for it would be just as if he were to say to him, ‘Sacrifice be to thee!’

<span id="v9_1_1_1717"><sup><small>9:1:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  He then makes offering to those forming pairs [^268]: ‘Reverence to so and so! reverence to so and so!’ It is as if he were to say, ‘Thou, N. N., and this one, do not ye two injure us!’ for in no wise does a man who is known and appealed to [^269] injure us.

<span id="v9_1_1_1818"><sup><small>9:1:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 17\], ‘Reverence be to the golden-armed leader of hosts, and to the lord of regions be reverence!’ for he (Rudra-Agni) is indeed the golden-armed [^270] leader of hosts, and the lord of regions. And in that everything in this second chapter of formulas applies to one and the same deity, thereby he gratifies that (god Rudra), and makes the chief to have a share in the people (or the clan): hence whatever belongs to the people [^271], in that the chieftain has a share. And those (Rudras) that spread over these worlds, countless, by thousands [^272], they are the deities to whom he now offers.

<span id="v9_1_1_1919"><sup><small>9:1:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  He thus makes offering to the tribes (of Rudras), for it was those tribes, those Rudras, that spread, and wheresoever they are there he thereby gratifies them. And thus, indeed, (he gratifies) those tribes of Rudras; and, men being after the <span id="p161">[<sup><small>p. 161</small></sup>]</span> manner of the gods, therefore also these tribes of men: tribe after tribe he thus gratifies them.

<span id="v9_1_1_2020"><sup><small>9:1:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  Now some of these (formulas) have ‘reverence’ on both sides, and others on one side only;—more terrible and more unappeased, indeed, are those (Rudras) that have ‘reverence’ on both sides: on both sides he thereby appeases them by sacrifice, by reverence.

<span id="v9_1_1_2121"><sup><small>9:1:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  With (each set of) eighty (formulas) he utters the Svâhâ [^273],—on the first anuvâka, and on eighty, and on eighty; and the formulas which follow as far as the ‘unstringing’-formulas (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 54-63),—eighties [^274] mean food: by means of food he thus gratifies them.

<span id="v9_1_1_2222"><sup><small>9:1:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  He thus mutters these formulas (the last four of Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 46), ‘Reverence be to you, the sparkling (hearts of the gods)!’ for this is his favourite resort, either as a dear son or the heart: hence whenever he should be in fear of that god (Rudra), let him offer with those mystic utterances, for he draws nigh unto the favourite resort of that god, and so that god does not injure him.

<span id="v9_1_1_2323"><sup><small>9:1:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  ‘Reverence be to you, the sparkling [^275],’ <span id="p162">[<sup><small>p. 162</small></sup>]</span> for those (Rudras) produce (kar) everything here,—‘hearts of the gods!’—Agni, Vâyu and Âditya (fire, wind and sun), these truly are the hearts of the gods;—‘Reverence to the discriminating!’—for those (gods) discriminate everything here;—‘Reverence to the destructive!’—for those (gods) destroy whom they wish to destroy;—‘Reverence to the irremovable!’—for those (gods) are not (to be) removed from these worlds.

<span id="v9_1_1_2424"><sup><small>9:1:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  He then mutters those that follow (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 47 seq.), ‘Chaser! lord of the (Soma) plant!’—that (god) is indeed a repeller, for he chases away whom he wishes to chase away;—‘lord of the plant’—that is, ‘lord of the Soma-plant;’—‘O blue-red cleaver [^276];’—these are names and forms of him: he thus gratifies him by calling him by his names;—‘frighten and hurt not these people and these cattle! let none of us sicken!’ as the text, so the sense.

<span id="v9_1_1_2525"><sup><small>9:1:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  That god (Rudra) is the kshatra (ruling power; chieftainship or chief); and for that chief these peasants set apart this special fore-share, to wit, that first section (of formulas); and now he (the Sacrificer) sets apart for him that after-share, and thereby gratifies him; and hence this (section) also belongs to a single deity, to wit, to Rudra; for it is him he thereby gratifies. <span id="p163">[<sup><small>p. 163</small></sup>]</span> 9:1:1:2626\. These are seven formulas,—of seven layers the fire-altar consists, and the year consists of seven months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him. These two kinds (of formulas) amount to twenty-one,—the twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-first (make up) this amount.

<span id="v9_1_1_2727"><sup><small>9:1:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  He then offers (the libations of the) ‘unstringing’-formulas [^277]. For at that time the gods, having gratified those (Rudras) by that food, unstrung their bows by means of these ‘unstringing’-formulas; and in like manner this (Sacrificer), having gratified them by that food, now unstrings their bows by means of these ‘unstringing’-formulas; for with an unstrung bow one injures no one.

<span id="v9_1_1_2828"><sup><small>9:1:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  Here now he says ‘at a thousand leagues,’ for a thousand leagues is the farthest distance; and he thus unstrings their bows at what is the farthest distance.

<span id="v9_1_1_2929"><sup><small>9:1:1:2929.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he says ‘at a thousand leagues,’—a thousand leagues means this Agni (fire-altar), for neither this way nor that way is there any other thing greater than he; and it is when he makes offering in the fire that he unstrings their bows at a thousand leagues.

<span id="v9_1_1_3030"><sup><small>9:1:1:3030.</small></sup></span>  ‘Countless thousands,—in this great sea,’—thus, wheresover they are, there he unstrings their bows. <span id="p164">[<sup><small>p. 164</small></sup>]</span> 9:1:1:3131\. There are ten of these ‘unstringing’-offerings he makes,—the Virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten syllables, and Agni is Virâ<i>g</i> (widely-shining or ruling); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus unstrings their bows.

<span id="v9_1_1_3232"><sup><small>9:1:1:3232.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the descending [^278] (series of oblations). For then (in the preceding oblations) he ascends these worlds upwards from hence: this is, as it were, an ascent away from here. But this (earth) is a firm resting-place: the gods returned to this resting-place; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now return to this resting-place.

<span id="v9_1_1_3333"><sup><small>9:1:1:3333.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he descends. Then (in the preceding oblations) he goes after those (gods), gratifying (propitiating) them. From thence he now recovers his own self unto life; and so does he by that self of his attain all vital power.

<span id="v9_1_1_3434"><sup><small>9:1:1:3434.</small></sup></span>  And., again, as to why he descends. He then (in the preceding oblations) gratifies those Rudras from hence upwards; he now does so again from thence hitherwards.

XVI 64\], ‘Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in the sky,’—he thereby does reverence to those Rudras who are in yonder world;—‘whose arrows the rain is,’ for the rain is <span id="p165">[<sup><small>p. 165</small></sup>]</span> indeed their arrows, and by the rain they injure whom they wish to injure.

<span id="v9_1_1_3636"><sup><small>9:1:1:3636.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

<span id="v9_1_1_3737"><sup><small>9:1:1:3737.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 66\], ‘Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling upon earth,’—he thereby does reverence to those Rudras who are in this (terrestrial) world;—‘whose arrows food is,’ for food is indeed their arrows, and by means of food they injure whom they wish to injure.

<span id="v9_1_1_3838"><sup><small>9:1:1:3838.</small></sup></span>  ‘To them (I stretch) ten (fingers) forwards, ten to the right, ten backwards, ten to the left, ten upwards [^279],’—of ten syllables consists the Virâ<i>g</i>, and Agni is Virâ<i>g</i>; there are ten seasons, and Agni is the seasons; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies them.

<span id="v9_1_1_3939"><sup><small>9:1:1:3939.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he says ‘ten-ten,’—there are ten fingers in the joined hands [^280]: he thus makes reverence to them in each direction; and hence he who is frightened places his hands together;—‘To them be reverence!’—he thus does reverence to them;—‘May they be gracious unto us!’—they thus are gracious unto him;—‘whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their jaws!’—thus he casts into their jaws <span id="p166">[<sup><small>p. 166</small></sup>]</span> whomsoever he hates, and whosoever hates him. He may say, ‘So-and-so I cast into their jaws!’ naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold upon him. But let him take no notice of this (injunction), for indicated of himself is he whom he who knows this hates.

<span id="v9_1_1_4040"><sup><small>9:1:1:4040.</small></sup></span>  In three turns he descends,—Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies them. With ‘Svâhâ’ (he makes offering), for the Svâhâ is food: with food he thus gratifies them. Thrice (in three turns) he ascends from hence upwards,—that makes six: the significance of this has been explained [^281].

<span id="v9_1_1_4141"><sup><small>9:1:1:4141.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he descends in three turns,—it is because he ascends in three turns: thus in as many turns as he ascends, in so many turns does he descend.

<span id="v9_1_1_4242"><sup><small>9:1:1:4242.</small></sup></span>  He then throws that arka-leaf [^282] into the pit; for it is therewith that he performs that sacrificial work sacred to Rudra, and that same (leaf) is inauspicious; he now puts it away, lest any one should tread on this inauspicious (leaf), and suffer injury thereby: hence (he throws it) into the pit. And, again, as to why (he throws it) into the pit,—the pit, doubtless, means the fire, and thus that fire consumes it. Now as to the (symbolic) correspondence.

<span id="v9_1_1_4343"><sup><small>9:1:1:4343.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘How does this <i>S</i>atarudriya of his attain to (conformity with) the year, and Agni? how does it correspond to the year, to <span id="p167">[<sup><small>p. 167</small></sup>]</span> Agni?’ Well, this <i>S</i>atarudriya includes three hundred and sixty (formulas); and (other) thirty, and thirty-five. Now, as to the three hundred and sixty which there are, so many are there days in the year: thereby it obtains the days of the year. And as to the thirty (formulas) which there are, they are the thirty nights of the month: thereby it obtains the nights of the month: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And as to the thirty-five (formulas) there are, they are the thirteenth month [^283], (Agni's) self,—the body (consists of) thirty (limbs [^284]), the feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing and off-breathing), and the head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year. And in this way this <i>S</i>atarudriya of his attains to (conformity with) the year, Agni, and corresponds to the year, Agni. And, indeed, in the <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ila fire-altar as many bricks with formulas attached to them are placed in the middle, for these bricks are indeed the same as these different Agnis (invoked in the <i>S</i>atarudriya); and thus these Agnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the <i>S</i>atarudriya.

<span id="v9_1_1_4444"><sup><small>9:1:1:4444.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘How does this <i>S</i>atarudriya of his attain to (conformity with) the Great <span id="p168">[<sup><small>p. 168</small></sup>]</span> Litany [^285]?—how does it correspond to the Great Litany?’ Well, those twenty-five formulas which there are on both sides of the eighties [^286], they are the twenty-five-fold body [^287]; and where the body (of the altar-bird) is, that (includes) the head, and the wings and tail. And what eighties (of formulas) there are (in the <i>S</i>atarudriya), thereby indeed the (corresponding) eighties (of the Mahad uktham) are obtained, for by eighties the Great Litany is recited. And what there is (in the <i>S</i>atarudriya) after the eighties that is for him the same as what there, in the Great Litany, is after the eighties [^288]; and in this way this <i>S</i>atarudriya <span id="p169">[<sup><small>p. 169</small></sup>]</span> of his attains to (conformity with) the Great Litany; in this way it corresponds to the Great Litany.

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v9_1_2_11"><sup><small>9:1:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He then sprinkles him (Agni-Rudra, the fire-altar). For the gods, having now appeased him by the <i>S</i>atarudriya, thereby appeased him still further; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has appeased him by the <i>S</i>atarudriya, still further appease him thereby.

<span id="v9_1_2_22"><sup><small>9:1:2:22.</small></sup></span>  With water he sprinkles him [^289],—water is a means of appeasing (soothing): he thus appeases him thereby. He sprinkles him all over; he thus appeases him all over. Thrice he sprinkles,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus appeases him.

<span id="v9_1_2_33"><sup><small>9:1:2:33.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he sprinkles him,—that Agni (the fire-altar), doubtless, is these worlds: by water he thus encompasses these worlds, by the ocean, indeed, he encompasses them. On every side (he sprinkles the altar): hence the ocean flows round these worlds on every side. From left to right (he sprinkles): hence the ocean flows round these worlds from left to right.

<span id="v9_1_2_44"><sup><small>9:1:2:44.</small></sup></span>  For safety from injury it is the Agnîdh who sprinkles, for the Agnîdh is the same as Agni, and no one injures his own self. From a stone (he sprinkles), for from the rock water springs forth;—from the arm-pit, for from the arm-pit water springs forth; from the right arm-pit [^290], for from the right arm-pit water springs forth. <span id="p170">[<sup><small>p. 170</small></sup>]</span> 9:1:2:55\. \[He sprinkles the stone, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 1\], ‘The food that is lying in the rock, in the mountain,’—for that food, water, is indeed contained in the rock, in the mountains;—‘the drink that is gathered from waters, plants and trees,’—for from all that that drink is indeed gathered;—‘that sap and food bring ye unto us, O Maruts, as bountiful givers!’—for the Maruts are the rulers of the rain. With ‘In the rock is thy hunger,’ he (after watering the altar) sets down (the pitcher on the stone): he thus lays hunger into the stone, whence the stone is not fit for eating. But hard also is the stone, and hard is hunger: he thus puts the hard along with the hard. With, ‘In me thy food!’ he takes up (the pitcher): he thereby takes up the food into his own self. Thus (he does) a second and a third time.

<span id="v9_1_2_66"><sup><small>9:1:2:66.</small></sup></span>  Having (finally) set down the pitcher, he perambulates thrice (the altar); for when (in sprinkling) he walks all round it, he, as it were, makes light of him (Agni-Rudra). He now makes amends to him, for (his own) safety.

<span id="v9_1_2_77"><sup><small>9:1:2:77.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he perambulates it,—he then (in sprinkling the altar) goes after him [^291] (Agni-Rudra): thereupon he now recovers his own self unto life, and so does he by that self of his obtain all vital power.

<span id="v9_1_2_88"><sup><small>9:1:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Thrice he perambulates it, for thrice he walks round it (whilst sprinkling): thus as many times as he walks round it, so many times does he perambulate it. <span id="p171">[<sup><small>p. 171</small></sup>]</span> 9:1:2:99\. Having thereupon put that stone into the water-pitcher, they throw it in that (south-western) direction, for that is Nir<i>ri</i>ti's region: he thus consigns pain [^292] to Nir<i>ri</i>ti's region.

<span id="v9_1_2_1010"><sup><small>9:1:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  For at that time, the gods, having appeased him by the <i>S</i>atarudriya and the water, thereby drove out his pain, his evil; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, after appeasing him by the <i>S</i>atarudriya and the water, cast away his pain, his evil.

<span id="v9_1_2_1111"><sup><small>9:1:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  Outside the fire-altar he throws it; for this fire-altar indeed is the same as these (three) worlds: he thus puts pain outside these worlds;—outside the sacrificial ground (vedi); for the Vedi is this (earth): he thus puts pain outside this earth.

<span id="v9_1_2_1212"><sup><small>9:1:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  Whilst standing at the right thigh of the Vedi, with his face to the east, he throws it southwards, with, ‘Let thy pain enter him whom we hate!’ and thus its pain enters whomsoever he hates. He may say, ‘Let thy pain enter so-and-so!’ naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold upon him; but let him take no notice of this, for indicated of himself is he whom he who knows this hates. If it [^293] should remain unbroken, let him bid (the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>) to break it; for only when it is broken, the pain enters him whom he hates. They return (to the altar) without looking back: they thus leave pain and evil behind without looking back to them.

<span id="v9_1_2_1313"><sup><small>9:1:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  Having returned, he makes the bricks his own <span id="p172">[<sup><small>p. 172</small></sup>]</span> milch cows; for the gods, having now appeased him (Agni-Rudra) by the <i>S</i>atarudriya and the water, and having driven out his pain and evil, returned (to the altar) and made the bricks their own milch cows; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, after appeasing him by the <i>S</i>atarudriya and the water, and casting off his pain and evil, return and make the bricks his own milch cows.

<span id="v9_1_2_1414"><sup><small>9:1:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  And some say, ‘Let him make them his own whilst sitting, for sitting one milks the cow.’ But let him rather make them his own standing; for that fire-altar is these worlds, and these worlds are, as it were, standing. And, moreover, one is stronger whilst standing.

<span id="v9_1_2_1515"><sup><small>9:1:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  \[He does so\], whilst standing (near the right thigh of the altar) with his face towards the north-east; in front stands that cow by the Sacrificer with her face towards the west (back), for from the right side they approach the cow which stands with its face towards the back (west).

<span id="v9_1_2_1616"><sup><small>9:1:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  And wherever he reaches (whilst stretching his arms over the altar), there he touches it and mutters this formula (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 2), ‘Let these bricks be mine own milch cows, O Agni!’ for Agni rules over this making of cows, whence he addresses Agni out of so many deities;—‘One, and ten [^294] . . . . and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion;’—for the one, to wit, one and ten, is the lowest quantity, and the other, to wit, a hundred thousand millions, and a billion, is the highest quantity; thus, having comprehended them by the <span id="p173">[<sup><small>p. 173</small></sup>]</span> lowest and the highest quantity, the gods made them their own milch cows; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), having thus comprehended them by the lowest and the highest quantity, make them his own milch cows. Hence also he need not care to make many (cows) his own [^295], for in yonder world that (Sacrificer), by means of the Brahman (holy writ), the Ya<i>g</i>us, will make many (cows) his own. And in that he carries on (the numbers) uninterruptedly, thereby he carries on, without interruption, his objects of desire.

<span id="v9_1_2_1717"><sup><small>9:1:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he makes the bricks his own milch cows,—this fire-altar is speech, for with speech it is built up; and when he says, ‘One, and ten, . . . and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion,’—‘one’ is speech, and a hundred thousand millions is speech, and a billion is speech: it is Speech herself that the gods thereby made their own milch cow; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby make Speech herself his own milch cow. And in that he carries on (the numbers) uninterruptedly, thereby it is Speech herself that he carries on:—‘Let these bricks be mine own milch cows, O Agni, hereafter in yonder world!’ He thereby makes them his own milch cows in this world, and he also makes them his own milch cows in yonder world; and thus they are profitable to him in both worlds, in this one and in the other.

<span id="v9_1_2_1818"><sup><small>9:1:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 3\], ‘The seasons ye are,’—for these (bricks) are indeed the seasons;—‘law-sustaining,’ that is, ‘truth-sustaining;’—'be ye season-abiding, law-sustaining!—for the bricks <span id="p174">[<sup><small>p. 174</small></sup>]</span> are the days and nights, and the days and nights indeed abide in the seasons;—‘fat-showering, honey-showering,’—he thereby makes them fat-showering and honey-showering for himself.

<span id="v9_1_2_1919"><sup><small>9:1:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  ‘The widely-shining by name,’—for the gods then called those bricks to them by their names, and in the same way in which they called them, they turned unto them; but the ‘space-fillers’ alone stood with averted faces discharging water, having no names applied to them. They called them by the name ‘the widely-shining,’ and they turned unto them. Hence, each time he has laid down ten bricks, he addresses them with the ‘space-filling [^296] (verse)’: he thereby makes them widely-shining (virâ<i>g</i>), for the Virâ<i>g</i> (metre) consists of ten syllables:—‘wish-milking, never-failing,’—he thereby makes them wish-milking and never-failing.

<span id="v9_1_2_2020"><sup><small>9:1:2:2020.</small></sup></span>  He then draws a frog, a lotus-flower, and a bamboo-shoot across (the central part of the altar). For the gods having now appeased him by the <i>S</i>atarudriya and the water, and having driven out his pain and evil, thereby still further appeased him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has appeased him by the <i>S</i>atarudriya and the water, and driven out his pain and evil, still further appease him thereby. In every direction he draws them: he thus appeases him everywhere.

<span id="v9_1_2_2121"><sup><small>9:1:2:2121.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he draws them across. Now, in the beginning, when the <i>Ri</i>shis, the vital airs, made up that Agni [^297], they sprinkled him with water: that water dripped off and became the frogs. <span id="p175">[<sup><small>p. 175</small></sup>]</span> 9:1:2:2222\. They (the waters) said to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, ‘Whatever moisture [^298] we had, has gone down.’ He said, ‘This tree shall know it!’—he shall know (vettu), he shall taste it (sa<i>m</i> vettu)—that one, indeed, they mystically call ‘vetasa’ (bamboo), for the gods love the mystic. And because they said, ‘Down (avâk) has gone our moisture (ka),’ they became avâkkâs;—‘avâkkâs,’ they mystically call ‘avakâs (lotuses),’ for the gods love the mystic. These, then, are those three kinds of water, to wit, the frog, the lotus-flower, and the bamboo-shoot: by means of these three kinds of water he appeases him.

<span id="v9_1_2_2323"><sup><small>9:1:2:2323.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he draws them across it;—when he (Agni, the fire-altar) is built up, he is being born, and he is born for every kind of food; and these are every kind of food, to wit, the frog, the lotus-flower, and the bamboo-shoot, for these, indeed, are animals, water, and trees: with all this food he gratifies him.

<span id="v9_1_2_2424"><sup><small>9:1:2:2424.</small></sup></span>  With the frog, on the part of animals, whence, of animals, the frog is the one affording least subsistence, for he is used up;—with the lotus-flower, on the part of water, whence of the kinds of water (plants), lotus-flowers are those affording least subsistence, for they are used up;—and with the bamboo-shoot, on the part of trees; whence, of trees, the bamboo is the one affording least subsistence, for it is used up.

<span id="v9_1_2_2525"><sup><small>9:1:2:2525.</small></sup></span>  Having tied them to a cane, he, in the first place, draws them eastwards along the right (south) part of the (body of the) altar inside the enclosing-stones, <span id="p176">[<sup><small>p. 176</small></sup>]</span> with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 4), ‘With the lotus-flower of the ocean we encompass thee, O Agni: be thou bright and propitious unto us!’ that is, ‘With the waters of the ocean we appease thee.’

<span id="v9_1_2_2626"><sup><small>9:1:2:2626.</small></sup></span>  Then northwards along the hind part (of the altar), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 5), ‘With an outer vesture of cold we encompass thee, O Agni: be thou bright and propitious unto us!’—that part of the cold which is frozen hard is an outer vesture of cold: thus, ‘By the frozen part of cold we appease thee!’

<span id="v9_1_2_2727"><sup><small>9:1:2:2727.</small></sup></span>  Then eastwards along the left (north) part, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 6), ‘Upon the earth, into the reed, into the rivers descend thou, O Agni, thou art the bile [^299] of waters: with them, come thou, O she-frog, and make the sacrifice bright-coloured and propitious for us!’ as the text, so the meaning.

<span id="v9_1_2_2828"><sup><small>9:1:2:2828.</small></sup></span>  Then southwards along the forepart, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 7), ‘Thou art the receptacle of waters, the abode of the ocean: let thy darts burn others than us! unto us be thou bright and propitious!’ as the text, so the meaning. He first draws them thus [^300], then thus, then thus, then thus: that is from left to right, for so it is with the gods.

<span id="v9_1_2_2929"><sup><small>9:1:2:2929.</small></sup></span>  Over the body (of the altar) he draws them <span id="p177">[<sup><small>p. 177</small></sup>]</span> first, for of (the bird, or Agni) that is born the body is born first, then the right wing, then the tail, then the left wing: that is from left to right, for so it is with the gods.

<span id="v9_1_2_3030"><sup><small>9:1:2:3030.</small></sup></span>  Over the wings and tail he draws them in the direction of the body (self): he thus lays calmness into his own self;—from the further end (he draws) hitherwards: he thus lays calmness into his own self from the further end hitherwards. The right wing, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 8), ‘O bright Agni, with thy light, (with thy dainty tongue, O god, bring hither the gods, and worship them)!’ The tail, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 9), ‘O bright and shining Agni, (bring hither the gods to our sacrifice and our offering)!’ The left wing, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 10), ‘He who with bright and glittering light (shineth upon the earth, as the dawns with their glow, who, the ever young, speeding, as in the race, in the battle, of the steed, thirsteth not in the heat).’ ‘Bright,’ he says each time, for whatever is kindly and propitious is bright: he thus propitiates him thereby.

<span id="v9_1_2_3131"><sup><small>9:1:2:3131.</small></sup></span>  With seven (formulas) he draws them across,—the altar consists of seven layers, and seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus crosses him. Having thrown the cane on the heap of rubbish;—

<span id="v9_1_2_3232"><sup><small>9:1:2:3232.</small></sup></span>  \[The Adhvaryu\] then sings hymns round it (the altar);—for therein that whole Agni is completed; and the gods laid into him that highest form, immortality; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby lay into him that highest form, immortality. Sâman-hymns are (used), for sâmans are vital airs, <span id="p178">[<sup><small>p. 178</small></sup>]</span> and the vital airs are immortality: immortality, that highest form, he thus lays into him. On every side he sings around it: everywhere he thus lays immortality, that highest form, into him.

<span id="v9_1_2_3333"><sup><small>9:1:2:3333.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he sings sâman-hymns round about it;—the gods then desired, ‘Let us make this body of ours boneless and immortal.’ They spake, ‘Think ye upon this, how we may make this body of ours boneless and immortal!’ They spake, ‘Meditate (<i>k</i>it) ye!’ whereby indeed they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer (<i>k</i>iti)! seek ye how we may make this body of ours boneless and immortal!

<span id="v9_1_2_3434"><sup><small>9:1:2:3434.</small></sup></span>  Whilst meditating, they saw those sâman-hymns, and sang them round about it, and by means of them they made that body of theirs boneless and immortal; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he sings the sâman-hymns round about it, make that body of his boneless and immortal. On every side he sings: everywhere he thus makes that body of his boneless and immortal. Standing he sings, for these worlds stand, as it were; and whilst standing one doubtless is stronger. He sings, after uttering (the syllable) ‘hi<i>m</i>,’ for therein the sâman-hymn becomes whole and complete.

<span id="v9_1_2_3535"><sup><small>9:1:2:3535.</small></sup></span>  He first sings the Gâyatra hymn [^301], for the Gâyatrî metre is Agni: he thus makes Agni his <span id="p179">[<sup><small>p. 179</small></sup>]</span> head, and that head of his (or of him, Agni) he thus makes boneless and immortal.

<span id="v9_1_2_3636"><sup><small>9:1:2:3636.</small></sup></span>  The Rathantara [^302] (hymn he sings) at the right wing; for the Rathantara is this (earth), and this (earth), doubtless, is the most essential (rasatama) of these worlds, for it is in her that all these essences (rasa) are contained, and ‘rasantama,’ indeed, they call mystically, ‘rathantara,’ for the gods love the mystic: he thus makes this (earth) his right wing, and that right wing of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.

<span id="v9_1_2_3737"><sup><small>9:1:2:3737.</small></sup></span>  The B<i>ri</i>hat [^302] (hymn he sings) at the left wing; the B<i>ri</i>hat (great), doubtless, is the sky, for the sky is the greatest (of worlds): he thus makes the sky his (Agni's) left wing, and that left wing of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.

<span id="v9_1_2_3838"><sup><small>9:1:2:3838.</small></sup></span>  The Vâmadevya [^302] (hymn he sings) on the body (of the altar); for the Vâmadevya is the breath, and the breath is air (vâyu, the wind), and he, Vâyu, doubtless, is the self (body) of all the gods: he thus makes the air (wind) his body, and that body of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.

<span id="v9_1_2_3939"><sup><small>9:1:2:3939.</small></sup></span>  The Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya [^302] (hymn he sings) near the tail;—the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya, doubtless, is the moon; for whenever a sacrifice becomes completed [^303], the essence of its oblations goes up to him (the moon); <span id="p180">[<sup><small>p. 180</small></sup>]</span> and inasmuch as sacrifice after sacrifice (ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a) goes up to him, the moon is the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya: he thus makes the moon his (Agni's) tail, and that tail of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.

<span id="v9_1_2_4040"><sup><small>9:1:2:4040.</small></sup></span>  He then sings the heart of Pra<i>g</i>âpati [^304];—the heart assuredly is yonder sun, for he (the sun) is smooth, and the heart is smooth; he is round, and the heart is round. On the body (of the altar) he sings, for the heart is in the body;—at the armpit [^305], for the heart is in (the vicinity of) the armpit;— <span id="p181">[<sup><small>p. 181</small></sup>]</span> at the right armpit, for the heart is nearer thereto [^306]: he thus makes the sun his (Agni's) heart, and that heart of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.

<span id="v9_1_2_4141"><sup><small>9:1:2:4141.</small></sup></span>  He sings about offspring (pra<i>g</i>â) and Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures and procreation);—when he sings about offspring, he lays the heart into offspring; and when he sings about Pra<i>g</i>âpati, he lays the heart into Agni.

<span id="v9_1_2_4242"><sup><small>9:1:2:4242.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he sings about offspring and Pra<i>g</i>âpati;—this Agni, doubtless, is both offspring and the lord of offspring, and hence, when he sings about Agni, he lays the heart both into the offspring and into the lord of offspring.

<span id="v9_1_2_4343"><sup><small>9:1:2:4343.</small></sup></span>  These (hymns) are the immortal bricks; he lays them down last (highest) of all:—he thereby makes immortality the highest thing of all this (universe), and hence immortality is the highest thing of all this (universe). Let none other but the Adhvaryu [^307] sing; for these (hymns) are bricks, and he (Agni, the fire-altar) would be built up in the wrong way [^308], were any other than the Adhvaryu to sing.

## Footnotes

[^261]: 156:1 Or, here, in this (atra), in the shape of this (altar) on which the fire is to be deposited.

[^262]: 156:2 That is, that whereby the deity is propitiated or appeased.

[^263]: 156:3 A fanciful etymology of <i>S</i>ata-rudriya, as if it were <i>s</i>ânta (propitiated) + rudriya, instead of ‘that which relates to a hundred Rudras’; cf. [paragraph 7](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_7).

[^264]: 157:1 That is to say, the leaf is used in lieu of the ordinary offering-spoon. Whilst making continual oblations on one of the three stones from this leaf, held in his right hand, the priest holds a piece of arka wood in his left hand. Mahîdh. on Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 1.

[^265]: 158:1 The site of the altar is enclosed within a continuous line of 261 pari<i>s</i>rits, about half a foot in width, running along its edge. Their height is indeterminate, with the exception of three of them, dug in at the back (west) corner of the left wing, of which one is to reach up to the knee, the second up to the navel, and the third up to the mouth; each of the latter two standing to the left (north) of the preceding one.

[^266]: 158:2 See I, 7, 3, 20, with note. Agni, in the form of the formidable Rudra (who is to be kept at a distance), is referred to.

[^267]: 159:1 Literally, the ruling power.

[^268]: 159:2 The first anuvâka of kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a XVI of the Vâ<i>g</i>. S. consists of sixteen verses; which of these the fourteen referred to in the next paragraph are is not clear to me.

[^269]: 160:1 That is from Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 17 seqq.

[^270]: 160:2 Or, who is appealed to as being known to us, i.e. in terms showing that he is known to us.

[^271]: 160:3 That is, aureis brachiis instructus.

[^272]: 160:4 Pra<i>g</i>âyâ yad dhanam asti, Sây.

[^273]: 160:5 See [paragraph 28](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_28).

[^274]: 161:1 The calculation here, as so often in regard to metres, is rather a loose one. Anuvâka I, consisting of sixteen verses, is taken as amounting to the first fourscore formulas; anuvâkas II and III, consisting of ten ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâs (each of which is calculated to consist of eight mantras), constitute the second fourscore; anuvâkas IV and V again form the third fourscore; anuvâkas VI-VIII (save the last four formulas, see [parag. 22](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_22)), the fourth fourscore; and from there to the ‘unstringing’-formulas, that is, from within XVI, 46 to 53, the fifth fourscore. At the end of each eighty formulas he is to utter one Svâhâ (sak<i>ri</i>t svâhâkâra<i>h</i>, Sây.).

[^275]: 161:2 An etymological play on the word ‘a<i>s</i>îti,’ as if derived from a<i>s</i>, to eat.

[^276]: 161:3 ? Or, scatterers, sprinklers (kirika), root k<i>rî</i>. The author of the p. 162 Brâhma<i>n</i>a, on the other hand, evidently takes it in the sense of ‘maker, producer.’

[^277]: 162:1 Thus (‘Zerspalter’) daridra is probably correctly interpreted (from root ‘dar,’ to split) by Prof. Weber; whilst the commentators take it in its ordinary sense of ‘poor’ (i.e. without an assistant, Mahîdh.); blue-red Rudra is called inasmuch as he is the ‘nîlaka<i>n</i><i>th</i>a’ blue-necked, and red all over the rest of his body.

[^278]: 163:1 Viz. Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 54-63: ‘What countless thousands of Rudras there are upon earth, their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues.—The Bhavas that are in this great sea, in the air, their bow do we unstring at a thousand leagues.’ Thus each formula ends with the ‘unstringing’ refrain.

[^279]: 164:1 Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 64-66. In making these three oblations to the Rudras in the sky, the air, and on earth respectively, the procedure is the reverse from that described in [paragraphs 11](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_11)\-[13](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_13), viz. first on the enclosing-stone which reaches up to his mouth, then on that reaching up to his navel, and lastly on that reaching up to his knee.

[^280]: 165:1 These words, as well as the spaced words in the next paragraph, are added to each of the three formulas in [paragraphs 35](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_35)\-[37](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_37).

[^281]: 165:2 The joining of the hollow of the hands, by placing the tips of the fingers together, is a sign of reverence.

[^282]: 166:1 Of objects numbering six, the seasons commonly occur, e. g. VI, 7, 1, 16.

[^283]: 166:2 See [paragraph 4](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_4). According to Kâty. <i>S</i>rautas. 18, 1, 6 both offering-utensils (the arka-leaf and the arka-stick) are thrown into the pit.

[^284]: 167:1 As Prof. Weber, ‘Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Nakshatra,’ p. 298, points out, this passage points to a six years’ period of intercalation, since, in counting 360 days in the year, the remainder accumulates in six years to an intercalary month of thirty-five days (or thirty-six according to Sat. Br. X, 5, 4, 5); and accordingly in Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXX, 15, and Taitt. Âr. IV, 19, 1, the names of the six years of such a period of intercalation are mentioned; while a five years’ period and the names of the respective years are more frequently referred to.

[^285]: 167:2 Viz. twenty fingers and toes, the upper and lower arms, the thighs and shanks, and the hands.

[^286]: 168:1 For the mahad uktham, or Great Litany, recited on the Mahâvrata day, see [p. 110](Book_4_8_6#p110), note [3](Book_4_8_6#fn202). According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, this does not refer to the Mahad uktham, or Great Litany, itself, but to its Stotra, the Mahâvrata-sâman (cf. note on [X, 1, 1, 5](Book_4_10_1#v10_1_1_5)), by the chanting of which it is preceded, and which, like the Great Litany itself, is represented as being composed of the different parts of Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati's bird-shaped body. Now, that part of the chant which corresponds to the god's trunk (âtman) is the only part of this Stotra which is chanted in the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>astoma, or twenty-five-versed hymn-form, which, indeed, is the characteristic Stoma of the Mahâvrata day, all other Stotras of that rite being chanted in that form. It is, however, doubtful to me whether it is not rather the opening part of the Great Litany itself representing the trunk that is here referred to, and which, indeed, consists of twenty-five verses; cf. F. Max Müller, Upanishads, I, p. 183. Besides, it has always to be borne in mind that the particular arrangement of the Great Litany which the authors of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a had before them, may have differed in some respects from those known to us.

[^287]: 168:2 See [p. 112](Book_4_8_6#p112), note [1](Book_4_8_6#fn204).

[^288]: 168:3 That is, the body with its twenty-four limbs, viz. the two arms, two legs, and the twenty fingers and toes.

[^289]: 168:4 According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stotra, chanted after the Mahad uktham, is here referred to. See [p. 111](Book_4_8_6#p111), note [1](Book_4_8_6#fn203). Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it to refer to the prose-formulas at the end of the Sastra, which, he says, represent the mind (buddhi) of Pra<i>g</i>âpati.

[^290]: 169:1 Or rather, he pours water on it (the altar).

[^291]: 169:2 That is, from the lower (or hindmost) point where the right p. 170 wing joins the body of the altar. Re there places a stone, from which he begins the sprinkling of the altar.

[^292]: 170:1 See [IX, I, 1, 33](Book_4_9_1#v9_1_1_33).

[^293]: 171:1 The burning heat of the fire, and all physical and mental suffering.

[^294]: 171:2 Viz. the stone, or the pot, according to others; cf. Katy. <i>S</i>rautas. XVIII, 2, 5-8. According to Prof. Weber the stone is meant to represent the hungry greed of the fire.

[^295]: 172:1 The intervening numbers here omitted increase by multiples of ten.

[^296]: 173:1 ? That is to say, he need not touch the altar more than once.

[^297]: 174:1 That is with the verse Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 54, beginning ‘Lokam p<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a,’ ‘Fill thou the space;’ see part iii, p. 153 note.

[^298]: 174:2 See VI, 1, 1, 1-5.

[^299]: 175:1 Thus, or essence (ra<i>s</i>a), according to Sâya<i>n</i>a; cf. [X, 6, 5, 1](Book_4_10_6#v10_6_5_1). The word ‘ka’ has, however, also the meaning ‘joy.’

[^300]: 176:1 That is, ‘the heat’ which is considered the chief property of the bilious humour.

[^301]: 176:2 The procedure in this case is an exact counterpart of the ploughing of the altar-site, for which see VII, 2, 2, 8-12, with notes. Hence also the verbs expressive of the two actions are closely analogous, viz. vik<i>ri</i>shati and vikarshati.

[^302]: 178:1 The Gâyatra-sâman is the hymn-tune composed on the verse called ‘the Gâyatrî,’ _par excellence_, or ‘Sâvitrî’ (tat savitur varenyam, Rig-veda III, 62, 10), which plays an important part in the religious fife of the Hindu. The verse, as figured for chanting, is given, Sâma-v. Calc. ed. vol. v, p. 60 1. On the present occasion, according to Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. I, 5, 11, a different text, viz. Sâma-v. II, 8, 14 (<i>Ri</i>g-veda IX, 66, 19, agna âyû<i>m</i>shi payase), is to be sung to this tune.

[^306]: 179:1 The Rathantara, B<i>ri</i>hat, Vâmadevya, and Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya tunes are apparently to be sung here on their original texts (Sâma-v. II, 30, 31, abhi tvâ <i>s</i>ûra nonuma<i>h</i>; II, 159, 160, tvâm id dhi havâmahe; II, 32, 33, kayâ na<i>s</i> <i>k</i>itra â bhuvat; and II, 53, 54, ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>â-ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>â vo agnaye), though hardly in their elaborate setting, as performed in chanting.

[^307]: 179:2 It should be remembered that the chanting of the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya (or Agnish<i>t</i>oma)-sâman marks the completion (sa<i>m</i>sthâ) of the ordinary (Agnish<i>t</i>oma) Soma-sacrifice.

[^308]: 180:1 The Pra<i>g</i>âpati-h<i>ri</i>daya, or Pra<i>g</i>âpater h<i>ri</i>dayam, as figured for chanting, is given, Sâma-v. Calc. ed. vol. ii, p. 499. It consists of the words, imâ<i>h</i> pra<i>g</i>â<i>h</i> pra<i>g</i>âpate(r) h<i>ri</i>dayam pra<i>g</i>ârûpam a<i>g</i>î<i>g</i>ane, with inserted stobhas and modulations. It is followed by a simpler form, which is perhaps the one used on the present occasion.

[^309]: 180:2 Viz. on the place where the right wing joins the body of the altar. According to other authorities, the <i>S</i>yaita hymn-tune is likewise to be sung near the left arm-pit (or, according to Sâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya, at the place where the Adhvaryu mounts the altar). For other variations, see Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 276. I do not think that the ritual of the White Ya<i>g</i>us, in omitting the left arm-pit, shows any gap or inconsistency, since the right arm-pit is marked out, not for any bodily parallelism, but for the simple reason that it is supposed to indicate the position of the heart. Whilst all the other places on which hymns are sung are essential parts of the bird Agni, the arm-pit is not an essential part, but is merely indicative of the central organ of the body. Lâ<i>t</i>y. I, 5, 11 seqq. supplies the following directions, apparently implying a somewhat different order of procedure from that followed in our text: He passes along the south, and whilst standing (east of the altar) with his face towards the west, he sings the Gâyatra at the head. Returning, he sings the Rathantara at the right wing. Going round behind, he sings the B<i>ri</i>hat at the left wing. Going back, and standing behind the tail, with his face towards the east, he sings the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya. The Vâmadevya he sings at the right, and the Pra<i>g</i>âpati-h<i>ri</i>daya at the left, arm-pit. Then follow different views held by different teachers.—With this ceremony, by which homage is paid to the different parts of Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati's body, compare the similar, but more elaborate, ceremony of the Parimâda<i>h</i> at the Mahâvrata, [X, 1, 2, 9](Book_4_10_1#v10_1_2_9) with note.

[^310]: 181:1 That is, by taking the auricles as parts of the heart.

[^311]: 181:2 According to Lâ<i>t</i>y. I, 5, 1 seq., it is the Prastot<i>ri</i> who sings these sâmans. A similar conflict of competence in this respect is referred to not only in regard to detached sâmans (cf. Kâty. IV, 9, 6-9), but even in regard to such solemn performances as the chanting of the Mahâvrata-sâman (cf. note on [X, 1, 1, 5](Book_4_10_1#v10_1_1_5)).

[^312]: 181:3 Vi-<i>k</i>ita, in this sense, appears to be a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to have read vi<i>g</i>ita (parâbhûta, defeated) instead.
