SATAPATHA-BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

FIFTH KÂ<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.
————————

### A. THE VÂ<i>G</i>APEYA.

## FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_1_1_11"><sup><small>5:1:1:11.</small></sup></span>  Once upon a time the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, strove together. And the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking, ‘Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?’ went on offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause [^28] of ruin.

<span id="v5_1_1_22"><sup><small>5:1:1:22.</small></sup></span>  But the gods went on making offerings unto one another. Pra<i>g</i>âpati gave himself up to them: thus the sacrifice [^29] became theirs; and indeed the sacrifice is the food of the gods [^30].

<span id="v5_1_1_33"><sup><small>5:1:1:33.</small></sup></span>  They then spake, ‘To which of us shall this [^31] belong?’ They did not agree together, saying, <span id="p2"><sup><small>[ p. 2 ]</small></sup></span> ‘To me! to me!’ Not being agreed, they said, ‘Let us run a race for it: whichever of us shall win, to him it shall belong!’—‘So be it!’ so they ran a race for it.

<span id="v5_1_1_44"><sup><small>5:1:1:44.</small></sup></span>  Then B<i>ri</i>haspati hasted up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion [^32],—Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) among the gods—saying, ‘Impel this for me, (so that) impelled by thee, I may win this!’ Then Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impelled it for him, and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>, he won: he became everything here, he won everything here; for he won Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures and procreation) indeed is everything here. By offering therewith he (B<i>ri</i>haspati) ascended to that upper region. Therefore who so knoweth, and who so knoweth not,—they say, ‘That upper region belongeth to B<i>ri</i>haspati.’

<span id="v5_1_1_55"><sup><small>5:1:1:55.</small></sup></span>  Thus they who of old used to offer the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, ascended to that upper region. From there Aupâvi <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruteya descended again: thenceforward (all men) descend again. <span id="p3"><sup><small>[ p. 3 ]</small></sup></span> 5:1:1:66\. Indra offered that (Vâ<i>g</i>apeya),—he became everything here, he won everything here; for he won Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati  is everything here: by offering therewith he ascended to that upper region.

<span id="v5_1_1_77"><sup><small>5:1:1:77.</small></sup></span>  Thus they who of old used to offer the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, ascended to that upper region. From there Aupâvi <i>G</i>âna<i>s</i>ruteya descended' again: thenceforward (all men) descend again.

<span id="v5_1_1_88"><sup><small>5:1:1:88.</small></sup></span>  And whosoever offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, he becomes everything here, he wins everything here; for he wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed is everything here.

<span id="v5_1_1_99"><sup><small>5:1:1:99.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say, ‘One must not offer the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins everything here,—for he wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is everything here,—he leaves nothing remaining here: his people (or offspring) is like to become worse (off).’

<span id="v5_1_1_1010"><sup><small>5:1:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  Let him none the less sacrifice: whatever (priests) thus know that sacrifice properly, in respect of the Ri<i>k</i>, the Ya<i>g</i>us, and the Sâman, and such as are proficient, let them assist him in offering it; for verily this is the perfection of that sacrifice, when wise (priests) assist him in offering it: let him therefore sacrifice by all means.

<span id="v5_1_1_1111"><sup><small>5:1:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  Now truly this (the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya) is the Brâhma<i>n</i>a's own sacrifice, inasmuch as B<i>ri</i>haspati (the lord of prayer and devotion) performed it; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or priestly dignity), and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman. And it is also that of the Râ<i>g</i>anya, inasmuch as Indri performed it; for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or ruling power), and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra. <span id="p4"><sup><small>[ p. 4 ]</small></sup></span> 5:1:1:1212\. To the king (râ<i>g</i>an) doubtless belongs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya; for by offering the Râ<i>g</i>asûya he becomes king; and unsuited for kingship is the Brâhma<i>n</i>a. And, moreover, the Râ<i>g</i>asûya is the lower, and the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya the higher (sacrifice).

<span id="v5_1_1_1313"><sup><small>5:1:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  For by offering the Râ<i>g</i>asûya [^33] he becomes king, and by the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya (he becomes) emperor (samrâ<i>g</i>); and the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher: a king might indeed wish to become emperor, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher; but the emperor would not wish to become king, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher.

<span id="v5_1_1_1414"><sup><small>5:1:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  Thus that (king) who, by performing the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, becomes emperor, possesses himself of everything here. Previously to each performance (of an ish<i>t</i>i [^34]) he offers that oblation to Savit<i>ri</i> (the sun), with the text, ‘O divine Savit<i>ri</i>, impel (prosper) the sacrifice, impel Pra<i>g</i>âpati for his portion!’ <span id="p5"><sup><small>[ p. 5 ]</small></sup></span> 5:1:1:1515\. And even as then B<i>ri</i>haspati hasted up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller among the gods—saying, ‘Impel this for me, (so that) impelled by thee I may win it!’ and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impelled it for him; and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> he won it; even so does this (sacrificing king) now haste up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion—Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller among the gods—saying, ‘Impel this for me: may I win it, impelled by thee!’ and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impels it for him, and he wins it impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>.

<span id="v5_1_1_1616"><sup><small>5:1:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  Wherefore he says (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 1), ‘God Savit<i>ri</i>, speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his portion! May the heavenly. thought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought! May the Lord of Speech render our meat palatable, hail!’ For the Lord of Speech is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and meat means food: ‘May Pra<i>g</i>âpati this day make palatable this our food!’ thus he thereby says. This same oblation he offers till the day before the Soma-feast, for thus that performance of his has been commenced; and he (Savit<i>ri</i>, the Sun) becomes serene during that sacrifice.


<span id="v5_1_2"><sup><small>5:1:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_1_2_11"><sup><small>5:1:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He draws the A<i>m</i><i>s</i>u [^35] (graha), just for completeness’ sake, for it is therefor that he draws <span id="p6"><sup><small>[ p. 6 ]</small></sup></span> the A<i>m</i><i>s</i>u. After that he draws those recognised Agnish<i>t</i>oma cups [^36] up to the Âgraya<i>n</i>a.

5:1:2:22, He then draws the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>yas [^37]: and whatever the gods (Agni, Indra, and Sûrya) won by them, even that he wins by them.

<span id="v5_1_2_33"><sup><small>5:1:2:33.</small></sup></span>  He then draws the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in: and whatever Indra won thereby, even that he (the sacrificer) wins thereby.

<span id="v5_1_2_44"><sup><small>5:1:2:44.</small></sup></span>  He then draws those five Vâ<i>g</i>apeya cups (for Indra; the first) with the text (V. S. IX, 2), ‘Thee, the firm-seated, the man-seated, the mind-seated! Thou art taken with a support [^38]: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb’ (i.e. thy home): thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for of these <span id="p7"><sup><small>[ p. 7 ]</small></sup></span> worlds this one, to wit the earth, is the firm one: this same world he thereby wins.

<span id="v5_1_2_55"><sup><small>5:1:2:55.</small></sup></span>  \[The second with,\] ‘Thee, the water-seated, the ghee-seated, the ether-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee most agreeable to Indra!’ therewith he deposits it; for among these worlds that ether (mentioned in the formula) is this air: he thereby wins this air-world.

<span id="v5_1_2_66"><sup><small>5:1:2:66.</small></sup></span>  \[The third with,\] ‘Thee, the earth-seated, the air-seated, the sky-seated, the god-seated, the heaven-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!’ therewith he deposits it; for god-seated, heaven-seated indeed is yonder world of the gods: the world of the gods he thereby wins.

<span id="v5_1_2_77"><sup><small>5:1:2:77.</small></sup></span>  \[The fourth with V. S. IX, 3,\] ‘The waters’ invigorating essence, being contained in the sun,—that which is the essence of the waters’ essence, that, the most excellent, I take for you! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!’ therewith he deposits it; for the waters’ essence is he that blows (or purifies) yonder (the wind), and he is contained in the sun, he blows from the sun: that same essence he thereby wins.

<span id="v5_1_2_88"><sup><small>5:1:2:88.</small></sup></span>  \[The fifth with IX, 4,\] ‘Ye cups, of strengthening libations, inspiring the sage with thought,—I have gathered together the pith and sap of you, the handleless! Thou art taken with a support: thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to <span id="p8"><sup><small>[ p. 8 ]</small></sup></span> Indra!’ therewith he deposits it;—pith means essence: it is the essence he thereby wins.

<span id="v5_1_2_99"><sup><small>5:1:2:99.</small></sup></span>  These, then, are five Vâ<i>g</i>apeya cups he draws; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati; and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year, and there are five seasons in the year,—he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati: therefore he draws five Vâ<i>g</i>apeya cups.

<span id="v5_1_2_1010"><sup><small>5:1:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) then draws seventeen (other) cups of Soma, and (the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>) seventeen cups of Surâ (spirituous liquor), for to Pra<i>g</i>âpati belong these two (saps of) plants, to wit the Soma and the Surâ;—and of these two the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the Surâ untruth, misery, darkness: both these (saps of) plants he thereby wins; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins everything here, since he wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed is everything here.

<span id="v5_1_2_1111"><sup><small>5:1:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  Now as to why he draws seventeen cups of Soma;—Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice [^39]: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is <span id="p9"><sup><small>[ p. 9 ]</small></sup></span> its measure, with that much he thus wins its truth, its prosperity, its light.

<span id="v5_1_2_1212"><sup><small>5:1:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  And why he draws seventeen cups of Surâ;—Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, with that much he thus wins its untruth, its misery, its darkness.

<span id="v5_1_2_1313"><sup><small>5:1:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  These two amount to thirty-four cups; for there are thirty-three gods, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the thirty-fourth: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.

<span id="v5_1_2_1414"><sup><small>5:1:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  Now when he buys the king (Soma), he at the same time buys for a piece of lead the Parisrut (immature spirituous liquor) from a long-haired man near by towards the south. For a long-haired man is neither man nor woman; for, being a male, he is not a woman; and being long-haired (a eunuch), he is not a man. And that lead is neither iron nor gold; and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Surâ [^40]: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long-haired man.

<span id="v5_1_2_1515"><sup><small>5:1:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  And on the preceding day they prepare two <span id="p10"><sup><small>[ p. 10 ]</small></sup></span> earth-mounds [^41], the one in front of the axle, and the other behind the axle: ‘Lest we should deposit together the cups of Soma, and the cups of Surâ,’—this is why, on the preceding day, they prepare two mounds, one in front, and the other behind the axle.

<span id="v5_1_2_1616"><sup><small>5:1:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  Now, when they take the Vasatîvarî water [^42] (into the havirdhâna shed) by the front door, the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> takes in the Parisrut-liquor by the back door. From the south they bring in the drinking vessels. The Adhvaryu, seated in front of the axle, with his face towards the west, draws the cups of Soma; and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, seated behind the axle, with his face towards the east, draws the cups of Surâ. The Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> a cup of Surâ; the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> a cup of Surâ: in this way they draw them alternately.

<span id="v5_1_2_1717"><sup><small>5:1:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  Neither does the Adhvaryu hold the Soma-cup beyond the axle towards the back, nor the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> the Surâ-cup beyond the axle towards the front, thinking, ‘Lest we should confound light and darkness!’

<span id="v5_1_2_1818"><sup><small>5:1:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu holds the Soma-cup just over the axle, and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> the Surâ-cup just below <span id="p11"><sup><small>[ p. 11 ]</small></sup></span> the axle, with (V. S. IX, 4), ‘United ye are: unite me with happiness!’ Thinking, ‘Lest we should say “evil”,’ they withdraw them again, with, ‘Disunited ye are: disunite me from evil!’ Even as one might tear a single reed from a clump of reed-grass, so do they thereby tear him from out of all evil: there is not in him so much sin as the point of a grass-blade. They deposit the two (cups each time on the mounds).

<span id="v5_1_2_1919"><sup><small>5:1:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the Adhvaryu draws the Madhu-graha (honey-cup) in a golden vessel, and deposits it in the middle of the Soma-grahas. He then draws the Ukthya, then the Dhruva. And when, at the last chant (of the evening press feast [^43]), he has poured those Soma-grahas one by one into the cups of the officiating priests, they make offering and drink them. At the midday-pressing it is told regarding the honey-cup, and the cups of Surâ: thereof then [^44].


<span id="v5_1_3"><sup><small>5:1:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_1_3_11"><sup><small>5:1:3:11.</small></sup></span>  At the Agnish<i>t</i>oma (Sâman [^45]) he seizes a (victim) for Agni, for the Agnish<i>t</i>oma (i.e. 'Agni's <span id="p12"><sup><small>[ p. 12 ]</small></sup></span> praise [^46]) is Agni: he thereby wins Agni. For the Ukthas [^47] he seizes one for Indra and Agni; for the hymns (uktha) relate to Indra and Agni [^48]: the hymns he thereby wins. For the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>i n he seizes one for Indra; for the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in is Indra: the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in (Indra) he thereby wins.

<span id="v5_1_3_22"><sup><small>5:1:3:22.</small></sup></span>  For the seventeenth (or seventeenfold) stotra [^49] he seizes one for Sarasvatî: thereby, while there is no over-night performance [^50], it is yet made like the night (performance); for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya <span id="p13"><sup><small>[ p. 13 ]</small></sup></span> wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year: by that (victim) for Sarasvatî he now wins the night: hence, while there is no night performance, it is made like the night.

<span id="v5_1_3_33"><sup><small>5:1:3:33.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he seizes a spotted sterile cow for the Victorious Maruts; for the spotted sterile cow is this (earth): whatever food, rooted and rootless, is here established on her, thereby she is a spotted cow. Now, he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins food, for vâ<i>g</i>a-peya [^51] doubtless means the same as anna-peya (food and drink); and the Maruts are the peasants, and the peasants are food (for the noble). ‘To the Victorious (Maruts)!’ he says, even for the sake of victory. It is difficult to obtain an invitatory and offering prayer containing the word ‘victorious:’ if he should be unable to obtain such as contain the word ‘victorious,’ any other two verses to the Maruts will do. Difficult to obtain also is a spotted sterile cow: if he cannot obtain a spotted sterile cow, any other sterile cow will do.

<span id="v5_1_3_44"><sup><small>5:1:3:44.</small></sup></span>  The course of procedure thereof (is as follows). When the Hot<i>ri</i> recites after the Mâhendra libation, then let them proceed with (the offering of) her omentum, for that, the Mâhendra [^52], is Indra's special (nishkevalya) libation; and his also are the Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra. Now the sacrificer is Indra: thus he thereby puts strength into the sacrificer in the very middle (of the sacrifice): <span id="p14"><sup><small>[ p. 14 ]</small></sup></span> that is why they should proceed with her omentum at that particular time.

<span id="v5_1_3_55"><sup><small>5:1:3:55.</small></sup></span>  They cook the portions [^53] in two lots. Of the one lot thereof, after making an ‘under-layer’ of ghee (clarified butter) in the <i>g</i>uhû spoon, he makes two cuttings from each (portion), bastes them once, and replenishes with ghee (the empty places of) the cuttings. Thereupon he makes one cutting from each into the upabh<i>ri</i>t spoon, bastes them twice, but does not replenish (the places of) the cuttings. Now, when of the one lot (of portions) he makes two cuttings from each, thereby that (sterile cow) becomes whole; and when he proceeds with those (portions), thereby he wins the divine race. He then presents the (other) half to the human kind: and thereby he wins the human kind (people, vi<i>s</i>).

<span id="v5_1_3_66"><sup><small>5:1:3:66.</small></sup></span>  But let him not do it in this wise; for verily he who departs from the path of the sacrifice, stumbles; and he who does it in this wise certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice. Hence when they proceed with the omenta of the other victims, only then let them proceed with the omentum of that (cow). They cook the portions in one lot, and do not present any to the human kind.

<span id="v5_1_3_77"><sup><small>5:1:3:77.</small></sup></span>  He then seizes seventeen victims for Pra<i>g</i>âpati. They are all hornless, all dark-grey [^54], all (uncastrated) males; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati; but Pra<i>g</i>âpati is food, and the victim (cattle) is food: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati. And Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Soma, and the victim is the visible <span id="p15"><sup><small>[ p. 15 ]</small></sup></span> Soma: he thus wins the visible Pra<i>g</i>âpati. There are seventeen (victims), because Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.

<span id="v5_1_3_88"><sup><small>5:1:3:88.</small></sup></span>  Now, they are all hornless;—for man is nearest to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and he is hornless, unhorned; and Pra<i>g</i>âpati also is hornless, unhorned; and these (victims) belong to Pra<i>g</i>âpati: therefore they are all hornless.

<span id="v5_1_3_99"><sup><small>5:1:3:99.</small></sup></span>  They are all dark-grey. Now, the dark-grey has two forms, the light hair and the black; and a couple means a productive pair, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of generation) represents productiveness, and those (victims) belong to Pra<i>g</i>âpati: therefore they are all dark-grey.

<span id="v5_1_3_1010"><sup><small>5:1:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  They are all males;—for the male means productiveness, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati represents productiveness: hence they are all males. Difficult to obtain are victims with these perfections: if he cannot obtain them (all) with these perfections, even some with these perfections will do; for verily Pra<i>g</i>âpati is everything here.

<span id="v5_1_3_1111"><sup><small>5:1:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  Now, some seize the last (victim) for Vâ<i>k</i> (Speech), thinking, ‘If there be anything beyond Pra<i>g</i>âpati, that is Speech: we thus win Speech.’ But let him not do it in this wise; for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is everything here,—these worlds and everything there is;—whatever speech speaks in these worlds, that speech he wins: therefore he need not heed this.

<span id="v5_1_3_1212"><sup><small>5:1:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  The course of procedure regarding these (victims is as follows). When the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a recites after the Vâmadevya [^55], let them then proceed <span id="p16"><sup><small>[ p. 16 ]</small></sup></span> with their omenta; for the Vâmadevya means productiveness, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati means productiveness, and these (victims) belong to Pra<i>g</i>âpati: therefore let them proceed with their omenta at that time.

<span id="v5_1_3_1313"><sup><small>5:1:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  And (when) the after-offerings have been performed, and the spoons have not yet been shifted (separated) [^56], then they proceed with the (chief) oblations of those (victims). That (point in the performance) is the end, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the end: thus he wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati at the very end. But were he to proceed therewith sooner, it would be just as if a man had already gone the way he still intends to go,—and where would he be after that [^57]?—therefore <span id="p17"><sup><small>[ p. 17 ]</small></sup></span> they proceed with their (chief) oblations at that time.

<span id="v5_1_3_1414"><sup><small>5:1:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  But let him not do it in this wise for he who departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles; and he who does it in this wise certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice. Hence whenever they proceed with the omenta of the other victims, let them at the same time proceed with the omenta of these; and whenever they proceed with the (chief) oblations of the other victims, let them at the same time proceed with the oblations of these. There is but one invitatory prayer, and one offering prayer; for (these offerings) belong to one deity. He says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘To Pra<i>g</i>âpati’—saying this (name) in a low voice—‘recite the invitatory prayer for the offering of the bucks!’—‘To Pra<i>g</i>âpati’ saying this in a low voice—‘urge the ready-standing offering of the bucks!’ and as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered, he makes the offering.


<span id="v5_1_4"><sup><small>5:1:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_1_4_11"><sup><small>5:1:4:11.</small></sup></span>  At the midday Soma-feast he consecrates (the Sacrificer) by sprinkling; and at the midday Soma-feast they run a race; for, verily, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is that sacrifice [^58] which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,—and indeed, they are even now produced after this one: thus he thereby wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati in the very centre (of the sacrifice).

<span id="v5_1_4_22"><sup><small>5:1:4:22.</small></sup></span>  The Mâhendra cup being not yet drawn,—for <span id="p18"><sup><small>[ p. 18 ]</small></sup></span> that, the Mâhendra, is Indra's special (nishkevalya) cup, and so also are his that Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra; and the Sacrificer is Indra: thus he consecrates him at his own dwelling-place. Hence, the Mâhendra cup being not yet drawn,—

<span id="v5_1_4_33"><sup><small>5:1:4:33.</small></sup></span>  He takes down the chariot [^59], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 5), 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt;' for the chariot is indeed a thunderbolt, and the sacrificer is Indra: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt;'—‘a winner of wealth,’ for the chariot is indeed a winner of wealth;—‘May this one win wealth by thee!’—wealth means food: ‘may this one gain food by thee,’ is what he thereby says.

<span id="v5_1_4_44"><sup><small>5:1:4:44.</small></sup></span>  That chariot, seized by the pole, he turns (from left to right) so as to make it stand inside the vedi [^60], with, ‘In the winning of wealth, the great Mother’—wealth means food: ‘in the winning of food, the great Mother’—is what he thereby says;—‘Aditi by name, we praise with speech;’ now Aditi is this earth: therefore he says, ‘Aditi by name, we praise with speech,’—‘whereon all this being hath settled;’ for indeed thereon all being here is settled;—‘thereon may the divine Savit<i>ri</i> prosper our stay!’ whereby he means to say, ‘thereon may the divine Savit<i>ri</i> prosper our Sacrificer!’

<span id="v5_1_4_55"><sup><small>5:1:4:55.</small></sup></span>  He then sprinkles the horses with water, either when being led down to be watered, or when brought <span id="p19"><sup><small>[ p. 19 ]</small></sup></span> up after being watered. Now in the beginning the horse was produced from the water; while being produced from the water, it was produced incomplete, for it was indeed produced incomplete: hence it does not stand on all its feet, but it stands lifting one foot on each side. Thus what then was left behind of it in the water, therewith he now completes it, and makes it whole: therefore he sprinkles the horses with water, either when being led down to be watered, or when brought up after being watered.

<span id="v5_1_4_66"><sup><small>5:1:4:66.</small></sup></span>  He sprinkles them, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. .IX, 6), ‘Within the waters is ambrosia, in the waters is medicine: at the praises of the waters may ye wax strong, ye horses!’ And with this also, ‘O divine waters, what rushing, high-peaked, wealth-winning wave ye have, therewith may this one win wealth!’ wealth is food: he thus says, ‘May he thereby gain food!’

<span id="v5_1_4_77"><sup><small>5:1:4:77.</small></sup></span>  He then yokes (the team of) the chariot. The right horse he yokes (puts to) first; for in human (practice) they indeed put to the left horse first, but with the gods in this way.

<span id="v5_1_4_88"><sup><small>5:1:4:88.</small></sup></span>  He yokes it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 7), Either the wind, or thought—‘for there is nothing swifter than the wind, and nothing swifter than thought:’ therefore he says, ‘Either the wind, or thought;—’(or) the seven and twenty Gandharvas [^61], <span id="p20"><sup><small>[ p. 20 ]</small></sup></span> they yoked the horse at first;' for the Gandharvas indeed yoked the horse at first: ‘May they who yoked the horse at first yoke thee!’ this he thereby says they;—‘laid speed into him,’—he thereby says, ‘May they who laid speed into it, lay speed into thee!’

<span id="v5_1_4_99"><sup><small>5:1:4:99.</small></sup></span>  He then yokes the left horse, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 8), ‘Become thou swift as the wind, O courser, being yoked!’—thereby he says, ‘Become quick as the wind, O courser, being yoked;’—'be thou as Indra's right (steed) in beauty!'—he thereby says, 'Even as Indra's right (steed) for beauty, so be thou that of the sacrificer for beauty!'—‘May the all-knowing Maruts yoke thee!’ he thereby says, ‘may gods yoke thee!’—‘May Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> lay speed into thy feet!’ in this there is nothing obscure. He then yokes the right side-horse; for in human (practice) they indeed yoke the left side-horse first, but with the gods in this way.

<span id="v5_1_4_1010"><sup><small>5:1:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  He yokes it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 9), ‘What speed hath been secretly laid into thee, O courser, and what (speed), bestowed on the eagle, went along in the wind;’—he thereby says, ‘what speed of thine, O courser, is hidden away even elsewhere, therewith win this our sacrifice, Pra<i>g</i>âpati!’—‘with that strength be thou strong and wealth-winning for us, O courser, and victorious at the gathering!’—wealth means food: he thus means to say, ‘And be thou a food-winner for us at this our <span id="p21"><sup><small>[ p. 21 ]</small></sup></span> sacrifice, at the gathering of the gods win thou this sacrifice, Pra<i>g</i>âpati!’

<span id="v5_1_4_1111"><sup><small>5:1:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  Now only those three (horses) are yoked, for what is threefold belongs to the gods, and this (sacrifice is) with the gods. Alongside the yoke (laid) on the side-horse [^62] goes a fourth (horse), for that one is human. When he is about to give that (chariot to the Adhvaryu), he gives it after yoking the fourth (horse) thereto. Hence also at any other sacrifice only those three (horses) are yoked; for what is threefold belongs to the gods, and this (sacrifice is) with the gods. Alongside the yoke of the side-horse goes a fourth (horse), for that one is human. When he is about to give that (chariot) away, he gives it after yoking the fourth (horse) thereto.

<span id="v5_1_4_1212"><sup><small>5:1:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  He now takes out material for a wild-rice pap of seventeen plates for B<i>ri</i>haspati; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins food,—vâ<i>g</i>a-peya being doubtless the same as anna-peya (food and drink): thus whatever food he has thereby won, that he now prepares for him.

<span id="v5_1_4_1313"><sup><small>5:1:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it belongs to B<i>ri</i>haspati:—B<i>ri</i>haspati won it in the beginning, therefore it belongs to B<i>ri</i>haspati.

<span id="v5_1_4_1414"><sup><small>5:1:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  And why it is prepared of wild rice:—B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman (priesthood), and those wild-rice grains are cooked with the Brahman (prayer),—therefore it is of wild rice. It is one of seventeen plates, <span id="p22"><sup><small>[ p. 22 ]</small></sup></span> because Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.

<span id="v5_1_4_1515"><sup><small>5:1:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  He makes the horses smell it, with ‘Ye coursers—;’ for horses are coursers (vâ<i>g</i>in): therefore he says, ‘Ye coursers,’—‘wealth-winners,’—wealth is food: ‘food-winners’ he thereby says;—‘starting upon the course;’ for they are about to run a race;—'smell ye B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion!' for this indeed is B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion: therefore he says, 'smell ye B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion!' And why he makes the horses smell it: he thinks, ‘may I win Him [^63]!’ therefore he makes the horses smell it.


<span id="v5_1_5"><sup><small>5:1:5</small></sup></span>

## FIFTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_1_5_11"><sup><small>5:1:5:11.</small></sup></span>  Now when they run a race, he thereby wins this same (terrestrial) world. And when the Brahman sings a Sâman on the cart-wheel set up on (a post) reaching to his navel, he thereby wins the air-world. And when he erects the sacrificial post, he thereby wins the world of the gods. Hence that threefold performance.

<span id="v5_1_5_22"><sup><small>5:1:5:22.</small></sup></span>  The Brahman mounts a cart-wheel, set up on (a post) as high as his navel [^64], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 10), <span id="p23"><sup><small>[ p. 23 ]</small></sup></span> ‘At the impulse (sava) of the god Savit<i>ri</i>, of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the highest heaven of B<i>ri</i>haspati!’ thus, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a sacrifices; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or sanctity), and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman.

<span id="v5_1_5_33"><sup><small>5:1:5:33.</small></sup></span>  And if a Râ<i>g</i>anya sacrifices, (he does so) with, ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the highest heaven of Indra!’ for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or power), and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.

<span id="v5_1_5_44"><sup><small>5:1:5:44.</small></sup></span>  Thrice he sings the Sâman [^65]. Having thrice sung it, he descends with, ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, of true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven of B<i>ri</i>haspati!’—thus, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a sacrifices, for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman.

<span id="v5_1_5_55"><sup><small>5:1:5:55.</small></sup></span>  And if a Râ<i>g</i>anya sacrifices,—with, ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, of true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven of Indra!’ for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.

<span id="v5_1_5_66"><sup><small>5:1:5:66.</small></sup></span>  They put up seventeen drums along the edge of the altar, from the Âgnîdhra backwards (towards <span id="p24"><sup><small>[ p. 24 ]</small></sup></span> the west); for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati; but Pra<i>g</i>âpati is speech, and that doubtless is the supreme speech which is (the outcome) of seventeen drums: he thus wins the supreme speech, the supreme Pra<i>g</i>âpati. Seventeen there are, because Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.

<span id="v5_1_5_77"><sup><small>5:1:5:77.</small></sup></span>  One of these drums he (the Brahman) beats (while praying) with a sacrificial formula: thereby all of them become beaten with a sacrificial formula.

<span id="v5_1_5_88"><sup><small>5:1:5:88.</small></sup></span>  He beats it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 11), ‘O B<i>ri</i>haspati, win the race! lift ye up your voice unto B<i>ri</i>haspati: make ye B<i>ri</i>haspati win the race!’ thus, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a sacrifices; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman.

<span id="v5_1_5_99"><sup><small>5:1:5:99.</small></sup></span>  And if a Râ<i>g</i>anya sacrifices, (he does so) with, ‘O Indra, win the race! lift ye up your voice unto Indra: make ye Indra win the race!’ for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.

<span id="v5_1_5_1010"><sup><small>5:1:5:1010.</small></sup></span>  And when those race-running chariots [^66] have come up again, he takes down one of those drums with a sacrificial formula; whereby they all become taken down with a formula.

<span id="v5_1_5_1111"><sup><small>5:1:5:1111.</small></sup></span>  He takes it down, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. I X, 12), ‘This hath been your true concord whereby ye (drums) have caused B<i>ri</i>haspati to win the race;—B<i>ri</i>haspati ye have caused to win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!’ thus, if a Brâhma<i>n</i>a <span id="p25"><sup><small>[ p. 25 ]</small></sup></span> sacrifices; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the Brahman.

<span id="v5_1_5_1212"><sup><small>5:1:5:1212.</small></sup></span>  And if a Râ<i>g</i>anya sacrifices, with, ‘This hath been your true concord whereby ye have caused Indra to twin the race;—Indra ye have caused to win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!’ for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râ<i>g</i>anya is the Kshatra.

<span id="v5_1_5_1313"><sup><small>5:1:5:1313.</small></sup></span>  A Râ<i>g</i>anya then [^67] shoots seventeen arrow's ranges northwards from the edge of the altar; for as much as is one arrow's range, so much is Pra<i>g</i>âpati crosswise; and as much as are seventeen arrow's ranges, so much is Pra<i>g</i>âpati lengthwise.

<span id="v5_1_5_1414"><sup><small>5:1:5:1414.</small></sup></span>  And as to why a Râ<i>g</i>anya shoots,—he, the Râ<i>g</i>anya is most manifestly of Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures): hence, while being one, he rules over many; and because ‘pra<i>g</i>âpati’ has four syllables, and ‘râ<i>g</i>anya [^68]’ also has four syllables, therefore a Râ<i>g</i>anya shoots. He shoots seventeen arrow's ranges, because Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold: he thereby wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.

<span id="v5_1_5_1515"><sup><small>5:1:5:1515.</small></sup></span>  And whichever (horse) he yokes with a formula, up to that the Sacrificer now steps [^69], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 13), ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, <span id="p26"><sup><small>[ p. 26 ]</small></sup></span> of true impulsion, may I win the race of the race-winning B<i>ri</i>haspati!’

<span id="v5_1_5_1616"><sup><small>5:1:5:1616.</small></sup></span>  And even as then B<i>ri</i>haspati hasted up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion,—Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller among the gods—saying, ‘Impel this for me: impelled by thee, may I win this!’ and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impelled it for him, and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>, he won; in like manner does he thereby haste up to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion,—Savit<i>ri</i> being the impeller among the gods,—saying, ‘Impel this for me: impelled by thee, may I win!’ and Savit<i>ri</i>, as the impeller, impels it for him, and impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> he wins.

<span id="v5_1_5_1717"><sup><small>5:1:5:1717.</small></sup></span>  And if a pupil of the Adhvaryu's or some (other) theological student were to know that prayer, stepping up he makes (the Sacrificer) say, ‘O coursers!’—for horses are indeed coursers: therefore he says, ‘O coursers’—‘wealth-winners!’ for wealth is food: ‘food-winners’ he thereby says;—‘keeping the roads,’ for they indeed run keeping (within) the roads;—‘measuring the stages;’ for measuring the stages they run over the course;—‘go ye to the winning-post!’ In order that the evil-doers, the Rakshas, may not hurt them midways, he thus says this.—They run the race, they beat the drums, and he (the Brahman) sings the Sâman.

<span id="v5_1_5_1818"><sup><small>5:1:5:1818.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) then [^70] either offers or addresses (the horses) with those two <i>g</i>agatî-verses: whether he offers, or whether he addresses (the <span id="p27"><sup><small>[ p. 27 ]</small></sup></span> horses), the significance (of the performance) is the same.

<span id="v5_1_5_1919"><sup><small>5:1:5:1919.</small></sup></span>  He offers, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 14; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 40, 4), ‘That courser speedeth after the whip, fettered at the neck and shoulder and mouth: may Dadhikrâ win according to his power; may he run along the windings of the roads, hail!’

<span id="v5_1_5_2020"><sup><small>5:1:5:2020.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 15; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 40, 3\], ‘And of him, the running, speeding, there fanneth like the wing of the eager bird,—as of the gliding eagle,—about the breast of Dadhikrâvan passing along with might, hail!’

<span id="v5_1_5_2121"><sup><small>5:1:5:2121.</small></sup></span>  He then either offers or addresses (the horses) with the following tristich: this is twofold, because he either offers or addresses. Whether he offers, or addresses (the horses), the significance is the same: he thereby speeds those running horses, imbues them with energy. There are here three earths, namely this one, and two beyond it: these he thereby wins.

<span id="v5_1_5_2222"><sup><small>5:1:5:2222.</small></sup></span>  He addresses (the horses, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 16; <i>Ri</i>k S. VII, 38, 7), ‘Auspicious be the coursers unto us at the invocations in the divine service, running their measured course, with beautiful song; swallowing the dragon, the wolf, the evil spirits: may they ever keep away from us affliction!’

<span id="v5_1_5_2323"><sup><small>5:1:5:2323.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 17; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 64, 6\], ‘Those racers, wont to hear the calls, may they all hear our call, the coursers running their measured course: they, the winners of thousands, eager to win at the winning of oblations, who have carried off great gain in the contests.’

<span id="v5_1_5_2424"><sup><small>5:1:5:2424.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 18; <i>Ri</i>k S. VII, 38, 8\], ‘In <span id="p28"><sup><small>[ p. 28 ]</small></sup></span> every race, help us, ye racers, at the prizes, ye wise, immortal knowers of the divine law: drink of this mead, be gladdened, and satisfied walk ye on the paths trodden by the gods!’

<span id="v5_1_5_2525"><sup><small>5:1:5:2525.</small></sup></span>  He then [^71] steps over against (the horses) with the Bârhaspatya pap, and touches it; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins food, since ‘vâ<i>g</i>a-peya’ is the same as ‘anna-peya:’ whatever food he has thus gained that he now, having reached that goal, brings in contact with himself, puts within himself.

<span id="v5_1_5_2626"><sup><small>5:1:5:2626.</small></sup></span>  He touches it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 19), ‘May gain of wealth come to me!’ wealth means food: he thus says, ‘May gain of food come (accrue) to me;’—‘May these two, Heaven and Earth, the all-shaped, come to me!’ for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Heaven and Earth;—‘May father and mother come to me!’ for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is both father and mother;—‘May Soma come to me with immortality!’ for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Soma.

<span id="v5_1_5_2727"><sup><small>5:1:5:2727.</small></sup></span>  He makes the horses smell it, with, ‘Ye coursers!’ for horses are coursers: therefore he says, ‘Ye coursers! wealth-winners!’ wealth is food: ‘food-winners’ he thereby says;—‘having run the course—’ for ‘starting (upon the course)’ he said before, as then they were indeed starting; but now he says, ‘having run,’ for they indeed have run (the race): therefore he says, ‘having run;’—'smell ye B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion—' for this is B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion: therefore he says, 'Smell ye B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion;'—‘taking (it) in!’ whereby. he imbues the Sacrificer with energy. And as to why <span id="p29"><sup><small>[ p. 29 ]</small></sup></span> he makes the horses smell,—he made them smell before, thinking, ‘May I win this (world);’ and now (he does so) thinking, 'I have won this (world) that is why he makes the horses smell.

<span id="v5_1_5_2828"><sup><small>5:1:5:2828.</small></sup></span>  Now on one of those race-running (rival) chariots there has been standing either a Vai<i>s</i>ya, or a Râ<i>g</i>anya; he now sits down on the northern hip of the altar. Thereupon the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer, taking the honey-cup, step out by the front, door (of the cart-shed), and place it in the Vai<i>s</i>ya's, or Râ<i>g</i>anya's, hand. And the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, taking the cups of Surâ, steps out by the back door. He walks round by the back of the hall, and placing one (of the cups) in the Vai<i>s</i>ya's, or Râ<i>g</i>anya's, hand, he says, ‘With this I buy Him of thee!’ For the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the Surâ is untruth, misery, darkness: he thus imbues the Sacrificer with truth, prosperity, and light; and smites the Vai<i>s</i>ya with untruth, misery, and darkness;—whatever benefit (or enjoyment) he desires, he obtains for himself by those (cups of Surâ). But that cup of honey he presents to the Brahman, together with the golden vessel. In presenting it to the Brahman, he imbues himself with immortal life; for gold is immortal life;—and whatsoever benefit he desires that he thereby obtains for himself.

## Footnotes

[^28]: 1:1 Lit. ‘the mouth,’ i.e. the opening or beginning, of ruin. The St. Petersburg Dict. compares Prov. xvi. 18: ‘Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.’

[^29]: 1:2 Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures or generation) is both the sacrifice and the year (time); see III, 2, 2, 4.

[^30]: 1:3 See II, 4, 2, 1. To them (the gods) he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) said, ‘The sacrifice (shall be) your food, immortality your sustenance (ûr<i>g</i>), and the sun your light!’

[^31]: 1:4 For the neuter idam—hardly here ‘this universe,’ or ‘vâ<i>g</i>apeyam,’ p. 2 but rather ‘this thing, it’—the Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads ayam ‘he,’ i.e. Pra<i>g</i>âpati, or the sacrifice (ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, masc.); cf. note on [V, 1, 4, 15](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_4_15).

[^32]: 2:1 For want of a simpler and more homely set of terms for the derivatives of the verb sû ‘to animate’ here used, those used in the preceding volumes are here generally adhered to, though, as there, somewhat reluctantly. The simple ‘to bless, blessing, &c.’ might sometimes fit quite well, though no doubt they imply an idea altogether foreign to the etymological meaning of this verb, and could not possibly be used, as is the case here, of the animating influence of the sun. Sometimes ‘to speed’ has been chosen, where the etymological connection with Savit<i>ri</i> is not insisted upon; while in other passages ‘to consecrate, consecration, &c.’ might probably come nearer to the meaning of the original. Cp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 256.

[^33]: 4:1 Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XV, I, 1-2, lays down the rule that the Râ<i>g</i>asûya is to be performed by a king who has not yet performed the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya. Â<i>s</i>val. <i>S</i>r. IX, 9, 19, on the other hand, rules: ‘After performing it (the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya) let a king perform the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a the B<i>ri</i>haspati-sava’ (cf. V, 2, 1, 19). See also Kâty. XIV, 1, 2 seq. Cf. Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. VIII, 11, 1 seq.

[^34]: 4:2 During the bright fortnights (of the waxing moon) preceding and following the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya ceremony proper, the sacrificer has to perform a number of so-called pariya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a (‘surrounding or enclosing sacrifices’) consisting of one-day Soma-sacrifices of different kinds, each of which is preceded by a special dîkshâ, or initiation ceremony (cf. III, 1, 2, 1 seq.; Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. VIII, 11, 2). It is to the ish<i>t</i>is (dîksha<i>n</i>îyesh<i>t</i>i, prâya<i>n</i>îyesh<i>t</i>i) of these pariya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as that the above injunction regarding the performance of the Sâvitrî âhuti refers.

[^35]: 5:1 Regarding this cup, or libation (consisting, it would seem, of imperfectly pressed Soma-plants in water), see part ii, p. 424, note 1. Here, and in the sequel, the author only refers to those points of ceremonial in which the performance differs from that of the ordinary Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice, as described in part ii.

[^36]: 6:1 Viz. the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma; the Aindravâyava, Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a and Â<i>s</i>vina; the <i>S</i>ukra and Manthin; and the Âgraya<i>n</i>a. Part ii, pp. 256 seq.

[^37]: 6:2 That is, the three Atigrâhyas (part ii, p. 402, note 2), required for the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotras at the midday feast, when performed in their proper ‘p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a’ form, as they are at the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya sha<i>d</i>aha, and at a Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it-ekâha with all the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as. See IV, 5, 4, 24. The authorities of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us adopt a somewhat different arrangement. The Vâ<i>g</i>apeya cups are likewise called by them Atigrâhyas (Taitt. S. I, 7, 22; T. B. I, 3, 9), and these are apparently drawn by them immediately after the second of the ordinary three Atigrâhyas, the one belonging to Indra (T. S. vol. i, p. 996,—but see ib. p. 1955, where it is stated that they are drawn immediately after the Âgraya<i>n</i>a,—that is, probably, if the ordinary Atigrâhyas are not required). Then follows (the third ordinary Atigrâhya?), then the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in, and thereupon the seventeen cups for Pra<i>g</i>âpati.—Sâya<i>n</i>a remarks on our passage,—teshâm (atigrâhyâ<i>n</i>âm) prak<i>ri</i>tigatâ tritvasa<i>m</i>khyaiva <i>s</i>âkhântaravat sa<i>m</i>khyântarânupade<i>s</i>ât. MS. I. O. 657.

[^38]: 6:3 For an explanation of these notions, see part ii, p. 260, notes 1 and 2.

[^39]: 8:1 See I, 5, 2, 17, where the principal formulas used in making oblations are computed as consisting together of seventeen syllables. Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>. Br. 18, 6 insists especially on the symbolic identity of Pra<i>g</i>âpati and the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya on the double ground that the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya consists of seventeen stotras, and has for its characteristic mode of chanting the Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma, or seventeen-versed hymn. That this is indeed so will appear from a glance at the chief chants. The Bahishpavamâna-stotra, which in the ordinary Agnish<i>t</i>oma is chanted in the triv<i>ri</i>t-stoma, consisting of three triplets, or nine verses (see part ii, p. 310), is at the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya made to consist of seventeen verses, by the insertion of eight verses (S.V. II, 180-82; 186-90) between the second and third triplets. Again, the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna, ordinarily chanted in fifteen verses (part ii, p. 333), here consists of seventeen, viz. II, 105-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 663 (one verse); II, 663-4 (sung as triplet, in two tunes = six verses); II, 663, in a different tune again (one verse); II, 821-23 p. 9 (three verses)—making together seventeen verses. Similarly, the Ârbhava-pavamâna (chanted at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma also in the Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma, cf. part ii, p. 315; but here with modifications) consists of II, 165-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 42, 44 (two verses); II, 47-9 (in two tunes = six verses); II, 720-22 (three verses)—making together seventeen verses. For the similarly constructed Vâ<i>g</i>apeya hymn see page 11, note 1. See also Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. VIII, 11, 15 seq., where the number of officiating priests, as well as that of the various sacrificial fees, is fixed at seventeen. Similarly, Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. IX, 9, 2-3 says that there are either to be seventeen dikshâs, or the whole ceremony is to be performed in seventeen days.

[^40]: 9:1 According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, the difference between surâ and parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.

[^41]: 10:1 The mounds (khara) thrown up in the havirdhâna cart-shed, are used for placing the cups of Soma (and Surâ) after they are drawn, until they are used for the libations. See the plan of the sacrificial ground at the end of part ii; only that on the present occasion there is to be a second mound, for the placing of the Surâ-cups, under or just behind the axle of the southern Soma-cart (in the place where the Nârâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa cups to the Fathers were temporarily deposited at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma; see III, 6, 2, 25 with note). On this occasion a small door is also made in the southern wall of the cart-shed, by breaking through the hurdle.

[^42]: 10:2 Part ii, p. 222 seq.

[^43]: 11:1 The last chant (at the evening feast) of the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya sacrifice is the so-called Vâ<i>g</i>apeya-sâman, or B<i>ri</i>hat-stotra (Sâmav. II, 975-7), chanted, to the B<i>ri</i>hat tune, in the Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma; the three verses being, by repetitions, raised to the number of seventeen.—‘When he has poured . . . they offer it:’ this is apparently a case of the absolute construction of the gerund in ‘-ya,’ cf. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 108.

[^44]: 11:2 On these cups, or libations, see [V, I, 5, 28](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_5_28).

[^45]: 11:3 Of the seven fundamental forms (sa<i>m</i>sthâ) of Soma-sacrifice, each higher, or more complex, form is obtained by some additional ceremony, or ceremonies, being added on to one of the simpler forms of sacrifice. In the present paragraph, the author briefly reviews the lower forms of Soma-sacrifice, contained in the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, p. 12 with the view of enumerating the victims to be slaughtered at its performance; viz. the Agnish<i>t</i>oma with twelve chants and one victim; the Ukthya with fifteen stotras and two victims; and the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in with sixteen chants and three victims. For further particulars, see part ii, p. 397, note 2.

[^46]: 12:1 The Agnish<i>t</i>oma-sâman, the last (twelfth) and distinctive stotra of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice, is in praise of Agni (see part ii, p. 368, note 2). At the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya the ordinary (ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ŷâ) hymn is not chanted, but S.V. II, 973-4, sung to the Vâravantîya tune (Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 144), takes its place. Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>. Br. 18, 6, 16.

[^47]: 12:2 The three Uktha stotras (chants) and <i>s</i>astras (recitations) constitute the distinctive element of the Ukthya sacrifice; as the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>i-stotra and <i>s</i>astra (part ii, p. 401, note 3; p. 402, note i) constitute that of the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in sacrifice.

[^48]: 12:3 On the important place assigned to these two deities in the traditional arrangement of the Rigveda-sa<i>m</i>hitâ, see the introduction to part i, p. xvi.

[^49]: 12:4 That is the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya-sâman, see note [1](Book_3_5_1#fn43), [p. 11](Book_3_5_1#p11).

[^50]: 12:5 The author here alludes to another form of Soma-sacrifice, not contained in the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, viz. the Atirâtra, which is obtained by following up the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in (with its sixteen chants) with the so-called râtri-paryâya<i>h</i>, or night-rounds, consisting of three rounds of four chants each, or together twelve chants. These are succeeded, at day-break, by the Sandhi-stotra (or twilight chants), consisting of three chants. Although this night performance does not take place on the present occasion—the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya-sâman taking its place—the author claims for this form of sacrifice also the moral benefits which would accrue to the sacrificer from the Atirâtra, for the reason that the same victim (a be-goat for Sarasvatî) is offered on both occasions.

[^51]: 13:1 In Taitt. Br. I, 3, 2, 3, on the other hand, vâ<i>g</i>apeya (which doubtless means ‘drink of strength’) is explained first by vâ<i>g</i>âpya, ‘that through which the gods wished to obtain (aipsan) strength (vâ<i>g</i>am),’ and then by ‘drink of strength,’ i.e. Soma ‘by drinking (pîtvâ) which one becomes strong (vâ<i>g</i>in).’

[^52]: 13:2 For this libation, and the accompanying Nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra, at the midday Soma-feast, see part ii, pp. 338, 339, note 2.

[^53]: 14:1 For particulars regarding the meat portions, see part ii, p. 204 seq.

[^54]: 14:2 Or, black and white (<i>s</i>ukla-k<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a-var<i>n</i>a), as ‘<i>s</i>yâma’ is explained by Sâya<i>n</i>a.

[^55]: 15:1 The Vâmadevya-sâman (Sâmav. II, 32-34) is the second P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotra, after the chanting of which, at the midday feast, p. 16 the first assistant of the Hot<i>ri</i>, the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a, has to recite his (the second) Nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra; see part ii, p. 325, note 2; p. 339, note 2.—As regards the Hot<i>ri</i>'s P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotra, the Rathantara-sâman (S. V. II, 30, 31) is used for it; while the Abhîvarta tune (S. V. ed. Bibl. Ind. III, p. 93) is employed in the chanting of the Brahma-sâman (S. V. II, 35, 36; see part ii, p. 434, note I) instead of the ordinary Naudhasa tune. Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>. Br. 18, 6, 11-14.

[^56]: 16:1 On this ceremony with which the concluding rites of the ish<i>t</i>i commence, see I, 8, 3, 1 seq.

[^57]: 16:2 Or possibly, what would then become of him? The author's reasoning seems to be that, if the sacrificer were to offer any of the chief oblations at an earlier point in the performance, he would thereby anticipate the results he wants to obtain from the whole performance,—or, so to speak, he would then already reach the goal for the attainment of which the subsequent oblations are likewise intended. For the same reason the offering of the omentum of the sterile cow, previously to and independently of the omenta of the other victims, was discountenanced in paragraph [6](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_3_6). Our present passage is interpreted rather differently by Professor Delbrück in his Altindische Syntax, p. 550:—Wenn er vorher damit vorginge, so wäre das so, als ob er, nach Betretung des Pfades, den er zu betreten beabsichtigt, wo? ware (d. h. in’s Unglück geriethe): ‘Were he to proceed therewith sooner, it would be just as if, after entering on the path he intends to enter upon, he would be where? (i.e. would get into trouble).’

[^58]: 17:1 In the original, ‘pra<i>g</i>âpati<i>h</i>’ is the predicate, not the subject, of the sentence; but considerations of construction seem to render the change desirable in English.

[^59]: 18:1 The Adhvaryu takes it down from the vâhana, or car-stand.

[^60]: 18:2 It is to be placed in the north-eastern part of the vedi, so as to be ready to start on the race northwards along the space between the <i>k</i>âtvâla (or pit) and the utkara (heap of rubbish); the horses thus being close to where the Brahman will have to mount a cartwheel put up on the utkara ([V, 1, 5, 2](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_5_2)).

[^61]: 19:1 Professor Weber (in his essay on the Nakshatras, II, 278; Abhandl. of Berlin Academy, 1861) takes this passage (—Taitt. S. 1, 7, 7, 2; Kâ<i>th</i>aka 13, 14; Maitr. S. I, 11, 1) to contain the first allusion to the system of Nakshatras, or lunar mansions marking the daily stations occupied by the moon (masc.) during his circuit round the heavens.—In the ritual of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us (Taitt. S. 1, 7, 7, 2) p. 20 this formula runs thus: ‘Either Vâyu, or Manu, or the Gandharvas, the twenty-seven, harnessed the horse at first, laid speed into him,’—which Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, interprets as meaning, ‘Vâyu, and Manu, and the (twenty-five) Gandharvas,—these seven and twenty. &c.’

[^62]: 21:1 Or, of the leader, as would appear from Sâya<i>n</i>a to Taitt. S. I, 7, 8 (p. 1024),—‘Between the right-hand and the left-hand horse he allows the shafts to project, and between them he puts the horse called “sapti” (in the text)’ No fourth horse is, however, apparently mentioned in the ritual of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us.

[^63]: 22:1 That is, B<i>ri</i>haspati; unless ‘lokam’ has to be supplied to ‘imam’ (‘this world’), as might appear probable from the next paragraph. See also [V. 1, 5, 27](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_5_27)\-[28](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_5_28).

[^64]: 22:2 According to the Taittirîya ritualists, as quoted by Sâya<i>n</i>a (Taitt. S. I, 7, 8), the wheel after being mounted by the Brahman is to be turned round thrice in a sunwise motion;—the (pointed) end of the post being apparently inserted in the navel of the wheel, lying horizontally upon it. The turning wheel is there compared with the Va<i>g</i>ra, or disk-shaped thunderbolt. While the wheel is turning round its axle, the Brahman sings the Sâman. Cf. also Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. V, 12, 9 seq., according to which authority, however, the Brahman p. 23 would seem only to put his arms on the wheel, and turn it round, while singing.

[^65]: 23:1 Viz. the ‘vâ<i>g</i>inâ<i>m</i> sâman’ (Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>y. Br. 18; 7, 12), Sâmav. I, 435 ‘àvir maryâ â vâ<i>g</i>am vâ<i>g</i>ino agman,’ &c. ‘The fiery steeds have gathered fiery mettle, the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i>; win ye the heaven, O coursers!’ Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. V, 12, 14. This singing of the Sâman takes place while the race lasts, the Brahman remaining all the time on the cart-wheel put up on a short post on (or near) the utkara, or heap of rubbish.—The author then anticipates in this and the next two paragraphs what the Brahman is to do when he descends from the wheel after the race is over. The placing of the drums next referred to must also be imagined as taking place whilst the Brahman is mounting the wheel.

[^66]: 24:1 Besides the Sacrificer's chariot inside the vedi, sixteen others, each drawn by four horses, have been got ready, outside the vedi, for the race to the udumbara branch, as its goal and turning-point. In paragraphs [10](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_5_10)\-[12](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_5_12) the author again anticipates what is to be done with the drums after the race has taken place, just in order to deal with that item of the ceremonial as a whole.

[^67]: 25:1 That is, after (or at the same time when) the drums are put up. He is to shoot northwards through the space between the utkara and <i>k</i>âtvâla. At the end of the seventeenth arrow's range he plants an udumbara branch in the ground to serve as the goal round which the chariots are to turn sunwise on their way back to the sacrificial ground.

[^68]: 25:2 Pronounce ‘râ-<i>g</i>a-ní-a.’

[^69]: 25:3 In the Taittirîya ritual (Taitt. S. I, 7, 7, 2; Taitt. Br. I, 3, 5, 4) the Sacrificer steps up to the chariot with the three Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, with appropriate formulas.

[^70]: 26:1 That is, he does so whilst the cars are running; the offering or prayers being intended to make the Sacrificer's car win the race.

[^71]: 28:1 That is, after the cars have come back, that of the Sacrificer keeping ahead of the others.
