### THE DÎKSHÂ, OR INITIATION.

## SIXTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_6_1_11"><sup><small>6:6:1:11.</small></sup></span>  Many [^481] are the oblations, in the building of the fire-altar, as well as at any other (special ceremony) than the building of the fire-altar. For there are supernumerary rites,—supernumerary are those which are (performed) over and above another rite: of these [^482] are the building of the altar (Agni<i>k</i>ityâ), the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha; and because they are over and above the other (normal) rites, therefore they are supernumerary. <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> 6:6:1:22\. A cake [^483] on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u,—that is the initiation (offering) of the (Soma) sacrifice;—one on twelve potsherds to Vai<i>s</i>vânara, and a pap to the Âdityas,—these two belong to Agni.

<span id="v6_6_1_33"><sup><small>6:6:1:33.</small></sup></span>  Now were he to prepare only the one for Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, and not the other two oblations, then only the initiation (offering) of the (Soma) sacrifice would be performed, and not those of Agni (the fire-altar); and were he to prepare only the other two oblations, and not the one to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, only the initiation (offering) of Agni would be performed, and not that of the sacrifice.

<span id="v6_6_1_44"><sup><small>6:6:1:44.</small></sup></span>  He prepares both that of the sacrifice, and those of Agni, for this rite is both a rite of sacrifice, and a rite of fire: first (comes) that of the sacrifice, and then that of the fire, for the rite of the fire is an accessory rite.

<span id="v6_6_1_55"><sup><small>6:6:1:55.</small></sup></span>  Now as regards that (cake) for Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, its mystic import is the same as what is (implied) in a preparatory ceremony. And the (cake) on twelve potsherds for Vai<i>s</i>vânara is for <span id="p248"><sup><small>[ p. 248 ]</small></sup></span> the obtainment of all the fires, Vai<i>s</i>vânara being all the fires;—it is one of twelve potsherds, for twelve months are a year, and Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the year.

<span id="v6_6_1_66"><sup><small>6:6:1:66.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he prepares one for Vai<i>s</i>vânara,—it is because he is about to produce Agni as Vai<i>s</i>vânara (belonging, or dear to, all men): in the initiation offering he first pours him forth as seed, and whatlike the seed is that is poured into the womb, suchlike is (the child) born therefrom; and inasmuch as he now pours forth that (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara as seed, therefore he is born hereafter as Vai<i>s</i>vânara.

<span id="v6_6_1_77"><sup><small>6:6:1:77.</small></sup></span>  And why he prepares those two (other) oblations,—Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the ruling power, and that Âditya pap is the people: he thus makes both the ruling power and the people. The Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake) he prepares first, and having thereby made the ruling power, he makes the people.

<span id="v6_6_1_88"><sup><small>6:6:1:88.</small></sup></span>  That (Vai<i>s</i>vânara cake) is one single (oblation), having one single deity: he thus makes the ruling power to be concentrated in one (person), and excellence to be concentrated in one. The other, the pap, has many deities, for the pap is a multiplicity of rite-grains, and those Âdityas are a multiplicity of gods: he thus bestows multiplicity on the people. Thus much as to the deities.

<span id="v6_6_1_99"><sup><small>6:6:1:99.</small></sup></span>  Now as regards the self (or body of Agni). The Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake) is the head, and that Âditya pap is the body: he thus makes both the head and the body. The Vai<i>s</i>vânara (cake) he prepares first; and having thereby made the head, he then makes the body.

<span id="v6_6_1_1010"><sup><small>6:6:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  That (Vai<i>s</i>vânara cake) is one single (oblation), for the head is, as it were, one only; and the <span id="p249"><sup><small>[ p. 249 ]</small></sup></span> other, the pap, has many deities, for that pap is a multiplicity of rice-grains, and this body is a multiplicity of limbs: he thus bestows on the body a multiplicity of limbs.

<span id="v6_6_1_1111"><sup><small>6:6:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  That (pap) is (prepared) on ghee, for the Âdityas are consumers of ghee: he thus gratifies them, each by his own share, by his own liquor. These offerings are (made) silently, for here in the sacrifice there is seed, and silently seed is infused.

<span id="v6_6_1_1212"><sup><small>6:6:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the Audgrabha<i>n</i>a (libations) [^484], for by the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as (elevatory libations) the gods raised themselves from this world to the heavenly world: and inasmuch as (thereby) they raised themselves (ud-grabh), they are called ‘audgrabha<i>n</i>a;’—and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as, now raise himself from this world to the heavenly world.

<span id="v6_6_1_1313"><sup><small>6:6:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  There are many of these, in the building of the fire-altar as well as at any other (special ceremony): the significance of this has been told. They are of both kinds: (the significance) of this has been told;—first those of the sacrifice, and then those of the fire: (the significance) of this also has been told.

<span id="v6_6_1_1414"><sup><small>6:6:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  He offers five of the sacrifice [^485],—the sacrifice is fivefold: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, by so much he thus pours it forth as seed. Seven (libations) of the fire,—the fire(-altar) consists of seven layers [^486]; seven seasons are a year, and <span id="p250"><sup><small>[ p. 250 ]</small></sup></span> Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Those two kinds (of libations) amount to twelve,—twelve months are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

<span id="v6_6_1_1515"><sup><small>6:6:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  He offers [^487], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 66-67), ‘The Purpose, Agni, the Impulse, hail!’—from purpose, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels (yokes, uses) it for this rite.

<span id="v6_6_1_1616"><sup><small>6:6:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  ‘Mind, Wisdom, Agni, the Impulse, hail!’—from the mind indeed this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.

<span id="v6_6_1_1717"><sup><small>6:6:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  ‘Thought, knowledge, Agni, the Impulse, hail!’—from thought, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.

<span id="v6_6_1_1818"><sup><small>6:6:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  ‘The distinction of Speech, Agni, the Impulse, hail!’—from speech, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.

<span id="v6_6_1_1919"><sup><small>6:6:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  ‘To Pra<i>g</i>âpati, to Manu, hail!’—Mann, forsooth, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, for he thought out (man) all this (universe); and Pra<i>g</i>âpati, indeed, of old performed this rite, and he now makes use of him for this rite.

<span id="v6_6_1_2020"><sup><small>6:6:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  ‘To Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, hail!’—Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, doubtless, is the year; and the year, indeed, <span id="p251"><sup><small>[ p. 251 ]</small></sup></span> of old performed this rite; and he now makes use thereof for this rite.

<span id="v6_6_1_2121"><sup><small>6:6:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the one to Savit<i>ri</i>, for Savit<i>ri</i>, indeed, of old performed this rite, and he now makes use of him for this rite,—(Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 67; <i>Ri</i>k S. V, 50, 1), ‘Every mortal would choose the friendship of the divine Guide; every one craves riches, and would have glory for him to prosper, hail!’ He who chooses the friendship of the god Savit<i>ri</i>, chooses both glory and prosperity; and he who performs this rite, indeed chooses his friendship.

<span id="v6_6_1_2222"><sup><small>6:6:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  Now some offer these Audgrabha<i>n</i>a libations into the fire-pan itself, saying, 'These, surely, are offered for (special) objects of desire, and that fire-pan is the Sacrificer's self: we thus secure for the Sacrificer's self all his objects of desire.' Let him not do so; for the fire which is kindled (in the fire-pan) is the essence of the completed sacrifice and of those libations, and when he puts the fire-pan on the fire, after the sacrifice has been completed and the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as offered, then the sacrifice mounts it (the pan), and it bears the sacrifice: let him, therefore, put the fire-pan on the fire only after the sacrifice is complete, and the Audgrabha<i>n</i>as have been offered.

<span id="v6_6_1_2323"><sup><small>6:6:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  It is covered with a layer of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass, just for the purpose that it may blaze up. And as to why it is with a layer of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass, (it is done) to avoid injury, for that Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass is a womb, and the womb does not injure the child; for he who is born, is born from a womb: ‘May he (Agni), when he is born, be born from the womb,’ thus he thinks. <span id="p252"><sup><small>[ p. 252 ]</small></sup></span> 6:6:1:2424\. Inside [^488] there is a layer of hemp, just for the purpose that it may blaze up. And as to its being a layer of hemp,—the inner membrane (amnion) of the womb from which Pra<i>g</i>âpati was born consists of flax, and the outer membrane (chorion) of hemp: hence the latter is foul-smelling, for it is the outer membrane of the embryo. \[It is so used\] to avoid injury, for the outer membrane does not injure the embryo; and it is from the outer membrane of the embryo that he who is born is born: ‘May he (Agni), when he is born, be born from the outer membrane of the embryo!’ thus he thinks.


<span id="v6_6_2"><sup><small>6:6:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_6_2_11"><sup><small>6:6:2:11.</small></sup></span>  Standing he puts it (the pan) on the fire, for the fire-pan is these worlds, and these worlds stand, as it were. And, moreover, whilst standing one is strongest.

<span id="v6_6_2_22"><sup><small>6:6:2:22.</small></sup></span>  Standing (with his face) towards north-east, for standing towards north-east Pra<i>g</i>âpati created creatures.

<span id="v6_6_2_33"><sup><small>6:6:2:33.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why (he does so) standing towards north-east;—that (quarter), the north-east, is the quarter of both gods and men.

<span id="v6_6_2_44"><sup><small>6:6:2:44.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why standing towards north-east,—in that quarter is the gate of the world of heaven, hence it is standing with his face towards northeast that one offers libations, and standing towards north-east that one leads up the dakshi<i>n</i>âs: it is by the gate that he thus makes him enter into the world of heaven. <span id="p253"><sup><small>[ p. 253 ]</small></sup></span> 6:6:2:55\. \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 68\] ‘Break not! Suffer not injury!’—as the text, so its meaning;—‘O mother, bear up bravely!’—for the fire-pan (ukhâ, f.) is a woman; and ‘O mother’ is a term for addressing a woman: ‘bear up well, indeed!’—(Thou) and Agni will do this (work)!'—for (the fire-pan) and Agni will indeed be doing this (sacred work).

<span id="v6_6_2_66"><sup><small>6:6:2:66.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 69\] ‘Stand firm, divine Earth, for our well-being!’ as the text, so its meaning;—‘A divine (âsura) contrivance thou art made in the wonted manner;’—the vital spirit (asu) is the breath, and this (are-pan) has indeed been made its contrivance in the wonted manner;—‘May this offering be agreeable to the gods!’ he thereby means those libations which he intends to offer in that fire; and moreover, that (fire-pan) itself is an offering;—‘unharmed rise thou in this sacrifice!’ this he says with the view that it may rise unharmed, uninjured, in this sacrifice.

<span id="v6_6_2_77"><sup><small>6:6:2:77.</small></sup></span>  With two (verses) he heats it on the fire,—the Sacrificer is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus heats it (the pan). \[He does so\] with a gâyatrî and a trish<i>t</i>ubh verse,—the Gâyatrî is the vital air, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh the body; and the animal is as much as the vital air and the body: thus by as much as the animal (consists of) he puts that (pan) on the fire. And, again, the Gâyatrî is Agni, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is Indra; and the fire relates to Indra and Agni: as great as the fire is, as great as is its measure, by so much he thus heats it. These two (verses) have seven feet (viz. three and four respectively),—the fire-altar consists of seven <span id="p254"><sup><small>[ p. 254 ]</small></sup></span> layers [^489]; seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

<span id="v6_6_2_88"><sup><small>6:6:2:88.</small></sup></span>  When the fire heats it, then the flame mounts up to it; for the fire-pan is a female, and the fire is a male: hence when the male heats the female, he infuses seed into her.

<span id="v6_6_2_99"><sup><small>6:6:2:99.</small></sup></span>  Now, if the flame is too long in mounting up, some throw coals on (the pan), thinking, ‘There is fire now on both sides.’ But let him not do so; for the animal is indeed born with bones [^490]; but it is not forced in with bones, as it were, at first; but it is introduced only as seed. Now that flame is boneless seed: hence the flame alone should mount up to it.

<span id="v6_6_2_1010"><sup><small>6:6:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  When the flame mounts up to it, he places a kindling-stick thereon: thereby the seed enters it (the fire-pan), and that fire imparts growth to that seed (in the shape of) this (kindling-stick).

<span id="v6_6_2_1111"><sup><small>6:6:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  It should be one of k<i>ri</i>muka wood. Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, strove together. The gods, having placed Agni in front, went up to the Asuras. The Asuras cut off the point of that flame held forward. It settled down on this earth, and became that k<i>ri</i>muka tree: hence it is sweet, for there is vital essence (in it). Hence also it is red, for it is a flame, that k<i>ri</i>muka <span id="p255"><sup><small>[ p. 255 ]</small></sup></span> tree being the same as this Agni: it is (in the shape of) fire that he imparts growth to it.

<span id="v6_6_2_1212"><sup><small>6:6:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  It (the kindling-stick) is a span long, for Vish<i>n</i>u, as an embryo, was a span long: he thus imparts to it growth equal to his body.

<span id="v6_6_2_1313"><sup><small>6:6:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  It is soaked in ghee;—the inner membrane of the womb from which Agni was produced consisted of ghee: hence he now blazes up towards it, for it (the stick) is his self (body); and hence it (the k<i>ri</i>muka) has no ashes: (Agni) himself now enters into his own self,—to avoid injury [^491], for the inner membrane does not injure the embryo; and it is from the inner membrane that he who is born is born: ‘When he (Agni) is born, may he be born from the inner membrane!’ thus he thinks.

<span id="v6_6_2_1414"><sup><small>6:6:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  He puts it (the kindling-stick) on, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 60; <i>Ri</i>k S. II, 7, 6), ‘The wood-eating, ghee-drinking,’—that is, he who has wood for his food, and ghee for his drink,—‘the primeval, desirable Hot<i>ri</i>,’—that is, ‘the old, desirable Hot<i>ri</i>;’—‘the wonderful son of power,’—power is strength: thus, ‘the wonderful son of strength.’ Standing he puts it on with the ‘Svâhâ:’ the meaning of this (will be explained) hereafter [^492].

<span id="v6_6_2_1515"><sup><small>6:6:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  Now the fire-pan is the body, the reed-grass (fuel) the womb, the hemp the inner membrane [^493], <span id="p256"><sup><small>[ p. 256 ]</small></sup></span> the ghee the outer membrane, and the kindling-stick the embryo.

<span id="v6_6_2_1616"><sup><small>6:6:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  The pan is outside, and the reed-grass (fuel) is inside; for the body is outside, and the womb inside. The reed-grass is outside, and the hemp inside; for the womb is outside, and the outer membrane is inside. The hemp is outside, and the ghee is inside; for the outer membrane is outside, and the inner membrane is inside. The ghee is outside, and the kindling-stick is inside; for the inner membrane is outside, and the embryo is inside. It is from these that he who is born is born, and from them he thus causes him (Agni) to be born.


<span id="v6_6_3"><sup><small>6:6:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_6_3_11"><sup><small>6:6:3:11.</small></sup></span>  He then puts on a vikaṅkata (flacourtia sapida) one. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati performed the first offering, a vikaṅkata tree sprang forth from that place where, after offering, he cleansed (his hands). That vikaṅkata, then, is that first offering; it is that he now offers on this (fire), and he therewith gratifies him (Agni). \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 71; <i>Ri</i>k S. VIII, 75, 15\] ‘From the far region come thou over to the near one: do thou protect that wherein I am!’ as the text, so its meaning.

<span id="v6_6_3_22"><sup><small>6:6:3:22.</small></sup></span>  He then puts on an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, strove together. Now all the trees sided with the Asuras, but the udumbara tree alone did not forsake the gods. The gods, having conquered the Asuras, took possession of their trees.

<span id="v6_6_3_33"><sup><small>6:6:3:33.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Come, let us lay into the udumbara tree whatever pith, whatever vital sap there is in these trees: were they then to desert us, they would <span id="p257"><sup><small>[ p. 257 ]</small></sup></span> desert us worn out, like a milked-out cow, or like an ox that has been (tired out by) drawing (the cart).’ Accordingly they laid into the udumbara tree what pith and essence there was in those trees; and on account of that pith it matures (fruit) equal to all the (other) trees [^494]: hence that (tree) is always moist, always full of milky sap,—that udumbara tree, indeed, (being) all the trees, is all food: he thus gratifies him (Agni) by every kind of food, and kindles him by all trees (kinds of wood).

<span id="v6_6_3_44"><sup><small>6:6:3:44.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 72\] ‘From the farthest distance,’—that is, ‘(from) what farthest distance there is;’—‘O red-steeded, come hither!’ for red, indeed, is Agni's horse;—‘Purîshya, much-loved,’—that is, ‘favourable to cattle, dear to many;’—‘O Agni, overcome thou the scorners!’ that is, ‘O Agni, overcome all evil-doers!’

<span id="v6_6_3_55"><sup><small>6:6:3:55.</small></sup></span>  He then puts on one not cut by an axe,—that (Agni) is born when he is built up: it is for all (kinds of) food that he is born. Now that (wood) not cut by an axe is one kind of food (for the fire): it is thereby that he now gratifies him. \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 73; <i>Ri</i>k S. VIII, 102, 20\] ‘Whatsoever wood we lay upon thee, O Agni, let all that be ghee unto thee, do thou relish that, O youngest!’ as the text, so its meaning: whatever (wood there is) not cut by the axe, that he makes palatable to him; and having made it food for him, he sets it before him.

<span id="v6_6_3_66"><sup><small>6:6:3:66.</small></sup></span>  He then puts on one that has lain on the ground,—he (Agni) is born when he is built up: it is for all (kinds of) food that he is born. Now that <span id="p258"><sup><small>[ p. 258 ]</small></sup></span> (wood) which has lain on the ground is one kind of food (for the fire): it is thereby he now gratifies him. \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 74; <i>Ri</i>k S. VIII, 102, 21\] ‘What the red ant eats, what the white ant crawls over,’—for either the red ant eats it, or the white ant crawls over it;—‘let all that be ghee for thee, do thou relish that, O youngest!’ as the text, so its meaning: whatever (wood) has lain on the ground, that he makes palatable for him; and having made it food for him, he sets it before him.

<span id="v6_6_3_77"><sup><small>6:6:3:77.</small></sup></span>  The remaining (kindling-sticks) are of palâ<i>s</i>a wood (butea frondosa);—the Palâ<i>s</i>a tree is the Brahman, it is by the Brahman he thus kindles him (Agni). And, again, why they are palâ<i>s</i>a ones—;the Palâ<i>s</i>a tree is Soma, and he, Soma, doubtless is the supreme offering: it is that he now offers on this (fire), and by that he gratifies him (Agni).

<span id="v6_6_3_88"><sup><small>6:6:3:88.</small></sup></span>  \[He puts them on, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 75-82\] ‘Day by day bearing unremittingly,’—that is, ‘Day by day bringing not unmindful;’—‘food to him like unto a standing horse,’—that is, ‘food as to a standing (resting) horse;’—‘we, rejoicing in wealth-thrift and sap,’—that is, ‘rejoicing in wealth, and thrift, and sap;’—‘O Agni, let not us, thy associates, suffer injury!’ this he says with a view that his (Agni's) associate (the Sacrificer) may not suffer injury.

<span id="v6_6_3_99"><sup><small>6:6:3:99.</small></sup></span>  'While Agni is kindling on the earth's navel,'—that (place) where he is now being kindled is indeed the navel of the earth;—‘we call for great wealth-thrift,’—that is, ‘we call for wealth and great thrift;’—‘Unto him, the draught-delighted,’—for he is indeed delighted (or, inebriated) <span id="p259"><sup><small>[ p. 259 ]</small></sup></span> by the draught,—‘of high praise,’—for he is indeed highly praised;—‘the adorable’—that is, ‘worthy of adoration;’—‘Agni, the conqueror, overpowering in battles;’—for Agni is indeed a conqueror, and overpowering in battles.

<span id="v6_6_3_1010"><sup><small>6:6:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  ‘Whatever aggressive armies there are, onrushing with drawn-up lines; whatever thieves and robbers, those I cast into thy mouth, O Agni.’—‘Devour thou in a lump the waylayers with thy two tusks, the thieves with thy teeth, and the robbers with thy jaws, O holy one!’—‘What waylayers there are among men, what thieves and robbers in the wood, what miscreants in the lurking-places, I throw them into thy jaws.’—‘Whatever man may plot against us, and whosoever may hate us, or abuse and seek to hurt us, every one of them burn thou to ashes!’

<span id="v6_6_3_1111"><sup><small>6:6:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  For the gods then made food of whosoever hated them, and of whomsoever they hated, and gave them up to him (Agni), and thereby gratified him; and this, then, became his food, and he burnt up the evil of the gods: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now make food of whosoever hates him, and of whomsoever he hates, and give them up to him (Agni), and thereby gratify him; and this, then, becomes his food, and he burns up the Sacrificer's evil.

<span id="v6_6_3_1212"><sup><small>6:6:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  These eleven (kindling-sticks) he puts on for one who is not either a noble, or a domestic chaplain (purohita); for incomplete are those eleven, and incomplete is he who is not either a noble, or a domestic priest.

<span id="v6_6_3_1313"><sup><small>6:6:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  Twelve (he puts on) for a noble or a domestic <span id="p260"><sup><small>[ p. 260 ]</small></sup></span> chaplain; for those twelve are a complete whole (or everything), and he who is either a noble or a domestic chaplain is everything.

<span id="v6_6_3_1414"><sup><small>6:6:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  In the case of a Purohita, he puts it on, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 80, ‘Perfected is my sanctity (brahman), perfected the vigour, the strength, perfected the victorious power (kshatra) whose Purohita I am!’—he thus perfects both his sanctity and power [^495].

<span id="v6_6_3_1515"><sup><small>6:6:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  And in the case of a nobleman, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 82),‘I have raised their arms, their lustre and strength: by the spiritual power I destroy the enemies, and elevate mine own (relatives)!’ this he says with the view that he may destroy his enemies, and elevate his own relatives. Let him put on both these (kindling-sticks); for both the Brahman and the Kshatra are this Agni; and it is this Agni he thus kindles by those two, by the Brahman and the Kshatra.

<span id="v6_6_3_1616"><sup><small>6:6:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  These (kindling-sticks) amount to thirteen;—thirteen months are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v6_6_3_1717"><sup><small>6:6:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  They are a span long, for Vish<i>n</i>u, as an embryo, was a span long; and this is (Agni's or Vish<i>n</i>u's) food: he thus gratifies him with food proportionate to his own body. But the food which is proportionate to one's body satisfies, and does no injury; but what is too much that does injury, and what is too little that does not satisfy. Standing he puts them on—the significance of this (will be explained) <span id="p261"><sup><small>[ p. 261 ]</small></sup></span> further on;—and with the Svâhâ (‘hail!’); for seed is infused here (in the sacrifice,—to wit,) this Agni; and were he to put on the logs unconsecrated by Svâhâ, he would injure him (Agni). Now inasmuch as they are kindling-sticks, they are not oblations; but inasmuch as (they are put on) with the Svâhâ, they are food, for the Svâhâ is food; and thus he does not injure him (Agni).


<span id="v6_6_4"><sup><small>6:6:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_6_4_11"><sup><small>6:6:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Having then stridden the Vish<i>n</i>u strides, and reverentially stood by (the fire) with the Vâtsapra [^496] (hymn), after the sun has set, he in the first place throws out the ashes (from the fire-pan). For at that (former) time he regales him (Agni) with that food, those kindling-sticks; and the foul part of that eaten food sinks to the bottom as ashes. He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech into him [^497], thus freed from foulness. Having infused speech, he puts on a kindling-stick,—and thereby regales him with food for the night,—with, ‘Night for night bearing unremittingly [^498]’—the meaning of this has been told: he prays for that same security and wellbeing for the night; and whatsoever he puts on 'thereafter by night, that he puts on as a libation offered to him [^499].

<span id="v6_6_4_22"><sup><small>6:6:4:22.</small></sup></span>  And in the morning, when the sun has risen, he in the first place throws out the ashes. For at that (former) time he regales him with that food, that kindling-stick; and the foul part of that eaten food which he puts on during the night sinks to the <span id="p262"><sup><small>[ p. 262 ]</small></sup></span> bottom as ashes. He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech into him thus freed from foulness. Having infused speech, he puts on a kindling-stick,—and thereby regales him with food for the day—with, ‘Day by day bearing unremittingly;’—the meaning of this has been told: he prays for that same security and well-being for the day; and whatsoever he puts on thereafter by day, that he puts on as a libation offered to him.

<span id="v6_6_4_33"><sup><small>6:6:4:33.</small></sup></span>  Verily, day and night passing on come up to a year, and the year is everything here: he prays for that security and well-being for a succession of days.

<span id="v6_6_4_44"><sup><small>6:6:4:44.</small></sup></span>  And when they give him (the Sacrificer) the fast-milk, he puts on a kindling-stick, after dipping it into the fast-milk. Some, however, say, ‘Let him not dip it into the fast-milk: he would be offering a libation, and it would be improper were one who is initiated to offer a libation.’

<span id="v6_6_4_55"><sup><small>6:6:4:55.</small></sup></span>  Let him nevertheless dip it in, for that (Âhavanîya fire) is his (the Sacrificer's) divine body, and this (real body of his) is his human one. Now were he not to dip it in, he would not be satisfying that divine body of his; but when he clips it in, he does so satisfy that divine body. And in that it is a kindling-stick, it is not a libation; and in that it is dipped into the fast-milk, it is food, for the fast-milk is food.

<span id="v6_6_4_66"><sup><small>6:6:4:66.</small></sup></span>  And having put on the kindling-stick, he drinks the fast-milk; for that (fire) is his divine body, and this (body of his) is the human one; and the gods (come) first, and then men: hence he drinks the fast-milk after putting the kindling-stick on (the fire).

<span id="v6_6_4_77"><sup><small>6:6:4:77.</small></sup></span>  \[He puts it on, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 83\] ‘O <span id="p263"><sup><small>[ p. 263 ]</small></sup></span> Lord of food; give us of thy food!’—that is, ‘O Lord of viands, give us of thy viands!’—‘of the pain-allaying, strengthening’—that is, ‘of the hunger-allaying, strengthening (food),’—‘Onward, onward lead thou the giver!’—the giver, doubtless, is the Sacrificer: thus, ‘Onward lead thou the Sacrificer!’—‘Give us sustenance for the two-footed and the four-footed!’—he thereby asks a blessing. Now as to the expiation in case of (the fire-pan being) broken which, he said, would be explained ‘in a subsequent chapter [^500].’

<span id="v6_6_4_88"><sup><small>6:6:4:88.</small></sup></span>  If the fire-pan were to break, let him pour that (fire in the pan) into any such unbroken, new pot with a wide mouth as there may be; for the pan which is broken indeed suffers injury, but uninjured is this deity (Agni): ‘Uninjured I will bear him in the uninjured!’ so he thinks. Into that (pot) he first throws a potsherd of the (broken) pan, and thus he (Agni) is not deprived of that womb of his.

<span id="v6_6_4_99"><sup><small>6:6:4:99.</small></sup></span>  He then takes the (remaining [^501]) clay, and having pounded both the (broken) pan and that remainder, and mixed it, he makes a (new) pan in the very same way, without using any formula, quite silently. Having baked it, he pours (the fire) over. The expiation in this case is one of performance only. Having again thrown that potsherd into the (new) pan, and pounded both the (temporary) pan and the remaining clay, and mixed it, he lays it aside for expiation.

<span id="v6_6_4_1010"><sup><small>6:6:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  And if the fire in the pan (Ukhya Agni) were to go out, it is doubtless to the Gârhapatya that it goes, for from the Gârhapatya it has been taken. Having then taken it out of the Gârhapatya eastwards (to the place of the Âhavanîya), and put fuel on it, let him <span id="p264"><sup><small>[ p. 264 ]</small></sup></span> put the fire-pan on it in the same way (as before), without using any formula, quite silently. When the fire rises up to it,—

<span id="v6_6_4_1111"><sup><small>6:6:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  He performs two expiations. For it is for (the obtainment of) all his wishes that he makes up that (fire); and whatever part of his wishes is here cut off when the fire goes out, that he thereby joins together and heals. He performs both expiations, that of the (Soma) sacrifice and that of the fire-altar,—first that of the sacrifice, then that of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained [^502].

<span id="v6_6_4_1212"><sup><small>6:6:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  Having cut out with a kindling-stick some of the butter, he offers sitting a libation, with (Vâg;. S. XII, 4,), ‘To Vi<i>s</i>vakarman, hail!’ Then stepping near he puts the kindling-stick on the fire, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 44), ‘Again the Âdityas, the Rudras, the Vasus may kindle thee, again the Brahmans with sacrifices, O bringer of good things!’—that is, ‘May those deities again kindle thee!’—‘With ghee make thou grow thy body, let the wishes of the Sacrificer be true!’—that is, ‘With ghee indeed make thou grow thy body, and for whatever wishes the Sacrificer makes up a fire, may they all come true!’

<span id="v6_6_4_1313"><sup><small>6:6:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  And if the Gârhapatya fire were to go out, it is doubtless to the churning-sticks that it goes, for from the churning-sticks it has been taken. Having churned it out with the churning-sticks, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations.

<span id="v6_6_4_1414"><sup><small>6:6:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  And if the Âhavanîya fire were to go out whilst the pressing (of Soma) proceeds, it is doubtless to the Gârhapatya that it goes, for from the Gârhapatya it has been taken. Having taken it straightway <span id="p265"><sup><small>[ p. 265 ]</small></sup></span> eastward from the Gârhapatya, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations: whatever (kind of Soma) sacrifice may be (performed) at the time, the expiation of that sacrifice he should perform; and of like kind is the expiation of the fire-altar.

<span id="v6_6_4_1515"><sup><small>6:6:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  And if the Âgnîdhrîya fire were to go out, it is doubtless to the Gârhapatya that it goes, for from the Gârhapatya it has been taken. Having taken it from the Gârhapatya eastward along the north of the Sadas, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations. And if the Gârhapatya were to go out, the meaning (procedure) of that has been explained.

## Footnotes

[^483]: 246:1 Or rather, too many, more (than are required at one of the normal Soma-sacrifices),—âdhvarikebhyo bahutarâni, Sây.

[^484]: 246:2 That is, as would seem from Sâya<i>n</i>a, of such ceremonies as have supernumerary, or additional, oblations to the normal ones connected with them. This discussion seems to be introduced here on account of the additional oblation (that to Vai<i>s</i>vânara) offered at the initiation ceremony. As an ‘additional’ or special, oblation at the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, Sâya<i>n</i>a refers to the pap of wild rice ([V, 1, 4, 12](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_4_12)); whilst at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya the one to Anumati ([V, 2, 3, 4](Book_3_5_2#v5_2_3_4)) is said to belong to the same category.

[^485]: 247:1 These and the subsequent offerings form part of the Dîkshâ, or initiation ceremony, for the Soma-sacrifice to be performed after the completion of the fire-altar. This initiation ceremony commences on the day of new moon, a week after the preparation of the ukhâ, or fire-pan. An integral part of (the first day of) this ceremony is the kindling of a fire in the ukhâ—the ‘Ukhya Agni’—which ultimately serves to supply the fires for the brick altars built on the completion of the period of initiation. The Dîkshâ is, as a rule, to be performed daily for a year, during which time the fire has to be kept up in the ukhâ, and carried about by the Sacrificer for a time each day. while the cake to Agni-Vish<i>n</i>u here mentioned is the ordinary cake-offering prescribed for the Dîkshâ of the normal Soma-sacrifice (see III, 1, 3, 1), the Vai<i>s</i>vânara cake is peculiar to the Agni<i>k</i>ayana.

[^486]: 249:1 See III, 1, 4, 1.

[^487]: 249:2 Viz. the five Audgrabha<i>n</i>a libations of the ordinary Soma-sacrifice offered in the manner there described. See part ii, p. 20, note.

[^488]: 249:3 Though Agni, or the fire-altar, is commonly called the five-layered one (pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>itika), consisting as it does of five complete p. 250 layers of bricks, on the top of these there is a small additional pile of two layers, the lower one (puna<i>s</i><i>k</i>iti) in the form of the Gârhapatya hearth ([VII, 1, 1, 1](Book_3_7_1#v7_1_1_1) seq.), and the upper one, consisting of two bricks, on which the fire is ultimately laid down. See [p. 188](Book_3_6_2#p188), note [4](Book_3_6_2#fn389). Hence Agni is also called ‘sapta<i>k</i>itika.’

[^489]: 250:1 Viz. the seven special Audgrabha<i>n</i>a libations of the Agni<i>k</i>ayana.

[^490]: 252:1 That is, underneath the layer of mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a. Both the reed-grass and the hemp are to be crushed and reduced to the condition of powder previously to their being strewed into the fire-pan.

[^491]: 254:1 See [p. 249](Book_3_6_6#p249), note [3](Book_3_6_6#fn486).

[^492]: 254:2 The fire ultimately to be placed on the new Gârhapatya hearth ([VII, 1, 1, 1](Book_3_7_1#v7_1_1_1) seq.)—whence the Âhavanîya on the great fire-altar has to be kindled—is to be produced in the ukhâ, or pan, as it were in its womb; but the material (grass and hemp) which has already been put in the pan, is only to be kindled by the blaze of the fire on which the pan has been placed, without any burning coals being applied to the fuel within the pan.

[^493]: 255:1 The dative ‘ahi<i>m</i>sâyai’ again doubtless belongs to the first sentence of the paragraph (‘it is soaked in ghee’), the intervening clauses being inserted for explanation. For a similar construction, see above, [p. 198](Book_3_6_3#p198), note [2](Book_3_6_3#fn407).

[^494]: 255:2 See [VI, 7, 2, 1](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_2_1).

[^495]: 255:3 The inverted order of the words ‘<i>s</i>a<i>n</i>â <i>g</i>arâyu’ is peculiar. It seems to have been resorted to with the view of keeping together the two pairs of subjects, ‘mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>â<i>h</i>\-<i>s</i>a<i>n</i>â<i>h</i>’ and ‘<i>g</i>arâyu-ulbam.’

[^496]: 257:1 According to Ait. Br. V, 24, its fruits ripen three times a year.

[^497]: 260:1 Or, his spiritual and political power, his priesthood and nobility.

[^498]: 261:1 See [VI, 7, 4, 1](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_4_1) seq.

[^499]: 261:2 Or, sets free the speech in him.

[^500]: 261:3 See above, [VI, 6, 3, 8](Book_3_6_6#v6_6_3_8).

[^501]: 261:4 Lit. ‘made into a libation for him.’

[^502]: 263:1 See [VI, 5, 2, 22](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_2_22).

[^503]: 263:2 See [VI, 5, 3, 7](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_3_7).

[^504]: 264:1 See [VI, 6, 1, 3](Book_3_6_6#v6_6_1_3) seq.
