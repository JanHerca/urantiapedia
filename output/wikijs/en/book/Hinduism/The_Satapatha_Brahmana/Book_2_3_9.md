## NINTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_9_1_11"><sup><small>3:9:1:11.</small></sup></span>  Now Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures), having created living beings, felt himself as it were exhausted [^546]. The creatures turned away from him; the creatures [^547] did not abide with him for his joy and food.

<span id="v3_9_1_22"><sup><small>3:9:1:22.</small></sup></span>  He thought within him, ‘I have exhausted <span id="p218"><sup><small>[ p. 218 ]</small></sup></span> myself, and the object for which [^548] I have created has not been accomplished: my creatures have turned away from me, the creatures have not abode with me for my joy and food.’

<span id="v3_9_1_33"><sup><small>3:9:1:33.</small></sup></span>  Pra<i>g</i>âpati thought within him, ‘How can I again strengthen myself: the creatures might then return to me; the creatures might abide with me for my joy and food!’

<span id="v3_9_1_44"><sup><small>3:9:1:44.</small></sup></span>  He went on praising and toiling, desirous of creatures (or progeny). He beheld that set of eleven (victims). By offering therewith Pra<i>g</i>âpati again strengthened himself; the creatures returned to him, his creatures abode for his joy and food. By offering he truly became better.

<span id="v3_9_1_55"><sup><small>3:9:1:55.</small></sup></span>  Therefore, then, let him offer with the set of eleven (victims), for thus he truly strengthens himself by offspring and cattle the creatures turn unto him, the creatures abide with him for his joy and food;—he truly becomes better by offering: therefore, then, let him offer with the set of eleven (victims).

<span id="v3_9_1_66"><sup><small>3:9:1:66.</small></sup></span>  In the first place he seizes [^549] a victim for Agni. For Agni is the head, the progenitor of the gods, he is the lord of creatures: and thereby the sacrificer truly becomes Agni's own.

<span id="v3_9_1_77"><sup><small>3:9:1:77.</small></sup></span>  Then one for Sarasvatî. For Sarasvatî is speech: by speech Pra<i>g</i>âpati then again strengthened himself; speech turned unto him, speech he made subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by speech, and speech turns unto him, and he makes speech subject to himself.

<span id="v3_9_1_88"><sup><small>3:9:1:88.</small></sup></span>  Then one for Soma. For Soma is food: by <span id="p219"><sup><small>[ p. 219 ]</small></sup></span> food Pra<i>g</i>âpati then again strengthened himself; food turned unto him, and he made food subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by food; food turns unto him, and he makes food subject to himself.

<span id="v3_9_1_99"><sup><small>3:9:1:99.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it comes after that for Sarasvatî,—Sarasvatî is speech, and Soma is food: he who is incomplete by (having only) speech, now becomes indeed an eater of food.

<span id="v3_9_1_1010"><sup><small>3:9:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  Then one for Pûshan. For Pûshan means cattle; by means of cattle Pra<i>g</i>âpati then again strengthened himself; cattle turned unto him, he made cattle subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of cattle; the cattle turn unto him, and he makes the cattle subject to himself.

<span id="v3_9_1_1111"><sup><small>3:9:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  Then one for B<i>ri</i>haspati. For B<i>ri</i>haspati means the priesthood (brahman); by means of the priesthood Pra<i>g</i>âpati then again strengthened himself; the priesthood turned unto him, he made the priesthood subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of the Brahman; the priesthood turns unto him, he makes the priesthood subject to himself.

<span id="v3_9_1_1212"><sup><small>3:9:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it comes after that for Pûshan,—Pûshan means cattle, and B<i>ri</i>haspati the priesthood; hence the Brâhma<i>n</i>a (priest) has the most power over beasts, because they are placed in front (are protected) by him [^550], because they are placed at the head (or in his mouth); therefore <span id="p220"><sup><small>[ p. 220 ]</small></sup></span> having given all that, he walks clad in sheepskin [^551].

<span id="v3_9_1_1313"><sup><small>3:9:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  Then one for the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâ<i>h</i>. For the All-gods mean everything (or the All); with everything Pra<i>g</i>âpati then again strengthened himself; everything turned unto him, and he made everything subject to him. And so does this one now become strong by everything; everything turns to him, and he makes everything subject to himself.

<span id="v3_9_1_1414"><sup><small>3:9:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it comes after that for B<i>ri</i>haspati,—B<i>ri</i>haspati means the priesthood, and the All-gods this All; he then makes the priesthood the head of this All; wherefore the Brahman is the head of this All.

<span id="v3_9_1_1515"><sup><small>3:9:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  Then one for Indra. For Indra means power (indriya) and vigour; by power and vigour Pra<i>g</i>âpati then again strengthened himself; power and vigour turned unto him, and he made power and vigour subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of power and vigour; power and vigour turn to him, and he makes power and vigour subject to himself.

<span id="v3_9_1_1616"><sup><small>3:9:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it comes after that for the All-gods,—Indra is the nobility, and the All-gods are the clans (people); he thus places the food before him.

<span id="v3_9_1_1717"><sup><small>3:9:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  Then one for the Maruts. For the Maruts mean the clans, and a clan means abundance; with abundance Pra<i>g</i>âpati then again strengthened himself; abundance turned unto him, and he made abundance subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by abundance; abundance <span id="p221"><sup><small>[ p. 221 ]</small></sup></span> turns unto him, and he makes abundance subject to himself.

<span id="v3_9_1_1818"><sup><small>3:9:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it comes after that for Indra,—Indra is the nobility, and the All-gods are the clans, and the Maruts are the clans; he thus guards the nobility by the clan, and hence the nobility here is on both sides guarded by the clan.

<span id="v3_9_1_1919"><sup><small>3:9:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  Then one for Indra and Agni. For Agni means penetrating brilliance, and Indra means power and vigour; with these two energies Pra<i>g</i>âpati then again strengthened himself; both energies turned unto him, and he made both energies subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by both these energies; both energies turn unto him, and he makes both energies subject to himself.

<span id="v3_9_1_2020"><sup><small>3:9:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  Then one for Savit<i>ri</i>. For Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) of the gods; and so all those wishes become accomplished for him, impelled as they are by Savit<i>ri</i>.

<span id="v3_9_1_2121"><sup><small>3:9:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  Then finally he seizes one for Varu<i>n</i>a; thereby he delivers him (the sacrificer) from every noose of Varu<i>n</i>a, from every (guilt) against Varu<i>n</i>a [^552],

<span id="v3_9_1_2222"><sup><small>3:9:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  Hence if there be eleven sacrificial stakes, let him bind Agni's (victim) to the one opposite the fire; and let them lead up the others one by one in the proper order.

<span id="v3_9_1_2323"><sup><small>3:9:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  But if there be eleven victims [^553], let them only immolate at the stake that for Agni, and after that the others in the proper order. <span id="p222"><sup><small>[ p. 222 ]</small></sup></span> 3:9:1:2424\. When they lead them northwards, they lead the one for Agni first, and then the others in the proper order.

<span id="v3_9_1_2525"><sup><small>3:9:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  When they throw them down, they throw down first the one for Agni, as the southernmost; then the others after leading them round northwards in the proper order.

<span id="v3_9_1_2626"><sup><small>3:9:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  When they perform (offerings) with the omenta, they perform first with the omentum of Agni's (victim); then with those of the others in the proper order.

<span id="v3_9_1_2727"><sup><small>3:9:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  When they perform with those (chief oblations), they perform first with that to Agni; then with the others in the proper order.


<span id="v3_9_2"><sup><small>3:9:2</small></sup></span>

### THE VASATÎVARÎ WATER.

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_9_2_11"><sup><small>3:9:2:11.</small></sup></span>  Now, when the head of the sacrifice (victim) was struck off, its sap, running, entered the waters. It is by that very sap that those waters flow; that very sap is believed to be flowing there [^554].

<span id="v3_9_2_22"><sup><small>3:9:2:22.</small></sup></span>  And when he goes for the Vasatîvarî water, he fetches that same sap and puts it into the sacrifice, and makes the sacrifice sapful; this is why he goes for the Vasatîvarî water.

<span id="v3_9_2_33"><sup><small>3:9:2:33.</small></sup></span>  He distributes it over all the Savanas (Soma-pressings) [^555]; thereby he imbues all the pressings <span id="p223"><sup><small>[ p. 223 ]</small></sup></span> with that sap, makes all the pressings sapful: this is why he distributes it over all the pressings.

<span id="v3_9_2_44"><sup><small>3:9:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Let him take it from flowing (water); for that sap of the sacrifice was moving [^556]: let him therefore take it from flowing (water).

<span id="v3_9_2_55"><sup><small>3:9:2:55.</small></sup></span>  Moreover, it is taken for the purpose of protection. Now, everything else here on earth, whatever it be, takes rest, even yonder blowing (wind); but these (waters) alone take no rest: therefore let him take it from flowing (water).

<span id="v3_9_2_66"><sup><small>3:9:2:66.</small></sup></span>  Let him take it by day, thinking, ‘Seeing, I will take the sap of the sacrifice [^557]:’ therefore let him take it by day. For it is for him that burns yonder (the sun) that he takes it, since he takes it for all the gods, and all the gods are his rays of light: therefore let him take it by day. For it is by day alone that he (shines): therefore, then, let him take it by day.

<span id="v3_9_2_77"><sup><small>3:9:2:77.</small></sup></span>  And again, all the gods, forsooth, now come to the sacrificer's house; and if one takes the Vasatîvarî water before the setting of the sun, it is as when one's better comes to visit one, he would honour him by trimming his house. They draw nigh to that sacrificial food, and abide (upa-vas) in that Vasatîvarî [^558] water,—that is the Upavasatha (preparation-day).

<span id="v3_9_2_88"><sup><small>3:9:2:88.</small></sup></span>  And if the sun were to set on any one's (Vasatîvarîs) not having been taken, then expiation is made. If he have performed a (Soma-)sacrifice before this, let him (the Adhvaryu) take it from his tank [^559], since <span id="p224"><sup><small>[ p. 224 ]</small></sup></span> that (water) of his has been taken before (sunset) by day. But should he not have offered before, if there be one who has offered (Soma) settled close by or somewhere thereabout [^560], let him take it from his tank, since that (water) of his has been taken before, by day.

<span id="v3_9_2_99"><sup><small>3:9:2:99.</small></sup></span>  But if he cannot obtain either kind (of water), let him seize a firebrand and betake himself (to the flowing water), and let him take thereof while holding that (firebrand) close above it; or let him take it while holding a piece of gold close above it: thus it is made like yonder burning (sun).

<span id="v3_9_2_1010"><sup><small>3:9:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  He takes therefrom with the text (V4;. S. VI, 23), ‘Rich in havis are these waters,’—for the sap of the sacrifice entered into them, wherefore he says, ‘Rich in havis (sacrificial food) are these waters;’—‘One rich in havis wooeth for (them),’ for the sacrificer, rich in havis, woos for (wishes to obtain) them; wherefore he says, ‘One rich in havis wooeth for (them).’

<span id="v3_9_2_1111"><sup><small>3:9:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  ‘Rich in havis (may be) the divine cult;’ cult, namely, means the sacrifice; thus he makes the sacrifice for which he takes it rich in sacrificial food, therefore he says, ‘Rich in havis is the divine cult.’

<span id="v3_9_2_1212"><sup><small>3:9:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘May Sûrya be rich in havis!’ For he takes it for yonder burning (sun), since he takes it for all the gods, and all the gods are his (the sun's) rays of light; therefore he says, ‘May Sûrya (the sun) be rich in havis!’

<span id="v3_9_2_1313"><sup><small>3:9:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  Having fetched it, he deposits it behind the Gârhapatya [^561], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 24), ‘I seat you in <span id="p225"><sup><small>[ p. 225 ]</small></sup></span> the seat of Agni, the safe-housed;’ whereby he means to say, ‘I seat you (waters) in the seat of Agni, whose house is unimpaired.’ And when the animal offering to Agni and Soma comes to a close, then he carries (the Vasatîvarî water) round. He says (thrice), ‘Disperse!’ The sacrificer is seated in front of the Soma-carts (holding Soma on his lap [^562]). He (the Adhvaryu) takes it (the water standing behind the Gârhapatya).

<span id="v3_9_2_1414"><sup><small>3:9:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  He walks out (of the hall) by the south (door), and puts it down on the south hip (of the high altar), with, 'Ye (waters) are Indra and Agni's share!' for he takes it for all the gods, and Indra and Agni are all the gods. He takes it up again and puts it down in front of the lady (who, seated behind the Gârhapatya, touches the water-jar). Walking round behind the lady he (again) takes it.

<span id="v3_9_2_1515"><sup><small>3:9:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  He walks out (of the hall by the east door), along the north side (of the altar), and puts down (the water) on the north hip (of the high altar), with, 'Ye are Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a's share!' Let him not put it down in this way [^563] that is redundant, and no fitting conclusion is thus attained. Let him rather (here also) say, 'Ye are Indra and Agni's share!' only thus there is nothing redundant, and so a fitting conclusion is obtained.

<span id="v3_9_2_1616"><sup><small>3:9:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  That (Vasatîvarî water) is carried round for the sake of protection; Agni is in front (of the sacrificial ground), and now that (water) moves about all round, repelling the evil spirits. He puts it <span id="p226"><sup><small>[ p. 226 ]</small></sup></span> down in the Âgnîdhra (fire-house) with, ‘Ye are all the gods’ share!' whereby he makes all the gods enter it. It is a desirable object (vara) to the dwellers (vasat), hence the name Vasatîvarî [^564], and verily he who knows this, becomes a desirable object to the dwellers.

<span id="v3_9_2_1717"><sup><small>3:9:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  Now there are here seven formulas; with four he takes (the water), with one he puts it down behind the Gârhapatya, with one he carries it round, with one (he puts it down) in the Âgnîdhra,—this makes seven. For when the metres were produced from Vâ<i>k</i> (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the <i>S</i>akvarî, was the last (highest) of them;—that completeness (he brings about): hence there are seven formulas.


<span id="v3_9_3"><sup><small>3:9:3</small></sup></span>

### THE SOMA FEAST.

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

#### A. PRÂTAR-ANUVÂKA (MORNING-PRAYER) AND PREPARATORY CEREMONIES.

<span id="v3_9_3_11"><sup><small>3:9:3:11.</small></sup></span>  They (the priests) are wakened (towards morning). Having touched water [^565], they proceed together to the Âgnîdhra (fire-house) and take the portions of ghee (for the Savanîya animal offerings). Having taken the portions of ghee, they betake themselves (to the high altar). When they have deposited the ghee,— <span id="p227"><sup><small>[ p. 227 ]</small></sup></span> 3:9:3:22\. He (the Adhvaryu) takes down the king (Soma) [^566]. Now this (earth) is a safe resting-place, and the birth-place of living beings; it is to this safe resting-place that he now takes him down; he spreads him thereon, produces him therefrom.

<span id="v3_9_3_33"><sup><small>3:9:3:33.</small></sup></span>  He takes him down between the shafts; for the cart is (a means of) the sacrifice, and thus alone he does not put him outside the sacrifice. He puts him on the pressing stones lying there with their heads (mukha, mouths) [^567] towards each other; for Soma is the nobility, and the stones are the clans (people); he thereby raises the nobility over the clan. And as to why they are lying with their heads together,—he thereby makes the clan of one head (or mouth) with, and uncontentious towards, the nobles; therefore they are lying with their heads towards each other.

<span id="v3_9_3_44"><sup><small>3:9:3:44.</small></sup></span>  He takes (Soma) down, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 25), ‘Thee for the heart, thee for the mind!’ This he says for the (accomplishment of the) sacrificer's wish, since it is with the heart and mind that the sacrificer entertains the wish for which he sacrifices; therefore he says, ‘Thee for the heart, thee for the mind!’

<span id="v3_9_3_55"><sup><small>3:9:3:55.</small></sup></span>  ‘Thee for the sky, thee for the sun!’ This, on the other hand, he says with a view to the world of the gods. When he says, ‘Thee for the sky, thee <span id="p228"><sup><small>[ p. 228 ]</small></sup></span> for the sun,’ he means to say, ‘Thee for the gods!’ ‘Upwards convey thou to the sky, to the gods, this cult, these invocations!’ Cult, doubtless, means sacrifice: he thereby means to say, ‘Upwards carry thou this sacrifice to the sky, to the gods!’

<span id="v3_9_3_66"><sup><small>3:9:3:66.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 26\], ‘O Soma, king, descend unto all thy people!’ whereby he brings him down for the lordship, for the sovereignty of these people (creatures).

<span id="v3_9_3_77"><sup><small>3:9:3:77.</small></sup></span>  Having quitted his hold (of Soma) he sits down by him, with, ‘May all thy people descend to thee.’ Now, in saying, ‘Descend unto all thy people,’ he does what is unseemly, for Soma being the nobility, he thereby, as it were, confounds good and bad [^568],—and, indeed, in consequence thereof, people now confound good and bad. But in this (formula) he does what is right and according to order,—in saying, ‘May all thy people descend to thee,’ he makes all his subjects go down (on their knees) before him; and hence when a noble approaches, all these subjects, the people, go down before him, crouch down by him on the ground [^569]. Sitting near (Soma), the Hot<i>ri</i> is about to recite the morning-prayer.

<span id="v3_9_3_88"><sup><small>3:9:3:88.</small></sup></span>  Then, while putting a kindling-stick (on the fire), he (the Adhvaryu) says, ‘Recite to the gods <span id="p229"><sup><small>[ p. 229 ]</small></sup></span> the early-coming!’ Now the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the metres; and the after-offerings are performed with, ‘Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite) to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!’

<span id="v3_9_3_99"><sup><small>3:9:3:99.</small></sup></span>  And so some say, ‘Recite to the gods [^570]!’ But let him not say so; for the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the metres, and the after-offerings are performed with, ‘Prompt—to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!’ therefore let him say, ‘Recite to the gods, the early-coming!’

<span id="v3_9_3_1010"><sup><small>3:9:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  And when he puts on a kindling-stick, it is the metres he thereby kindles. And when the Hot<i>ri</i> recites the morning-prayer [^571], he thereby <span id="p230"><sup><small>[ p. 230 ]</small></sup></span> again strengthens the metres, makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; for the metres had their vigour impaired by the gods, since it was through the metres that the gods reached the heavenly worlds; they neither sing praises (chants) nor recite (<i>s</i>astras) here. Hereby he now again strengthens the metres and makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; and by means of them, thus unimpaired in vigour, they <span id="p231"><sup><small>[ p. 231 ]</small></sup></span> perform the sacrifice; this is why the Hot<i>ri</i> recites the morning-prayer.

<span id="v3_9_3_1111"><sup><small>3:9:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say, 'What is the (Adhvaryu's) response to the morning-prayer [^572]?' The Adhvaryu should wait through (the prayer) waking, and when he blinks, this is his response. But let him not do this; if he fall asleep (again) he may as well sleep. When the Hot<i>ri</i> brings his morning-prayer to a close [^573],—there is an offering-spoon called Pra<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>î,—having therein taken ghee in four ladlings, he (the Adhvaryu) offers it.

<span id="v3_9_3_1212"><sup><small>3:9:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  For when the head of Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a (the sacrifice) was struck off, his sap, running, entered the waters; that (sap) he fetched yesterday with the Vasatîvarî water; and he now goes for what sap of the sacrifice remains therein.

<span id="v3_9_3_1313"><sup><small>3:9:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  And when he offers that offering, he pours out (the ghee) towards that same sap of the sacrifice (in the water) and draws it to him. And, indeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that offering, and thus satisfied and pleased, they fit that sap of the sacrifice together [^574] for him.

<span id="v3_9_3_1414"><sup><small>3:9:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  He offers with, ‘May Agni, with his flame, hear my prayer;’ whereby he means to say, ‘May he hear this prayer of mine, may he vouchsafe it to me;’—‘May the waters and the Soma-bowls hear, the divine!’ whereby he means to say, ‘May the waters hear this (prayer) of mine, may they vouchsafe it to me.’—‘Hear me, ye stones, <span id="p232"><sup><small>[ p. 232 ]</small></sup></span> as knowing the sacrifice!’ whereby he means to say, ‘May the (pressing) stones hear this (prayer) of mine, may they vouchsafe it to me;’ and ‘as knowing the sacrifice,’ he says, because the stones are indeed knowing [^575]. ‘May the divine Savit<i>ri</i> hear my prayer, Hail!’ whereby he means to say, ‘May the divine Savit<i>ri</i> hear this (prayer) of mine, may he vouchsafe it to me;’ for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods; impelled by him he goes for that sap of the sacrifice.

<span id="v3_9_3_1515"><sup><small>3:9:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  Having then a second time taken ghee by four ladlings, he says, while going forth towards the north, ‘Summon the waters!’ whereby he means to say, ‘Desire the waters, O Hotar!’ The reason why the Hot<i>ri</i> then recites [^576] is this: by that <span id="p233"><sup><small>[ p. 233 ]</small></sup></span> (oblation) he (the Adhvaryu) pours out (the ghee) towards that sap of the sacrifice (in the water), and draws it to him; and he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) then stands by those (Ekadhana pitchers) lest the evil spirits should injure them on the way.

<span id="v3_9_3_1616"><sup><small>3:9:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) then gives directions, 'Come hither, cup-bearer of the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a! Nesh<i>t</i>ar, lead up the wives! Ye bearers of the Ekadhana (cups), come hither! Agnîdh, step ever against the pit with the Vasatîvarî water and the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup!' this is a composite direction.

<span id="v3_9_3_1717"><sup><small>3:9:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  They walk northwards out (of the sacrificial ground)—by the back of the pit and the front side of the Âgnîdhra; whereupon they proceed in the direction in which the water is. They go thither together with the wives. The reason why they go thither with the wives is this.

<span id="v3_9_3_1818"><sup><small>3:9:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  When the head of the sacrifice was struck off, its sap, running, entered the waters; those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched it.

<span id="v3_9_3_1919"><sup><small>3:9:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  The gods then said, ‘Those Gandharvas, surely, are a great danger to us here, how can we carry off the sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury?’

<span id="v3_9_3_2020"><sup><small>3:9:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Well, the Gandharvas are fond of women; let us go together with the wives! The Gandharvas, surely, will hanker after the wives, and we shall carry off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.’

<span id="v3_9_3_2121"><sup><small>3:9:3:2121.</small></sup></span>  They went with the wives; the Gandharvas did indeed hanker after the wives, and they (the <span id="p234"><sup><small>[ p. 234 ]</small></sup></span> gods) carried off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.

<span id="v3_9_3_2222"><sup><small>3:9:3:2222.</small></sup></span>  And so does that (Adhvaryu) now go (to the water) with the wives; the Gandharvas hanker after the wives, and he carries off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.

<span id="v3_9_3_2323"><sup><small>3:9:3:2323.</small></sup></span>  He offers (the ghee) upon the water; for that sap of the sacrifice, indeed, draws near to that oblation, when offered; it rises (to the surface) to meet it; and having thus brought it to light, he seizes it.

<span id="v3_9_3_2424"><sup><small>3:9:3:2424.</small></sup></span>  And again why he offers this oblation: he thereby pours out (ghee) towards that sap of the sacrifice, and draws it to him, and craves it of the waters. And, indeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that oblation, and thus satisfied and pleased they fit that sap of the sacrifice together for him.

<span id="v3_9_3_2525"><sup><small>3:9:3:2525.</small></sup></span>  He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 27), ‘Ye divine waters,—the son of waters;’ the waters are indeed divine, hence he says, ‘Ye divine waters,—the son of waters;’ ‘That wave of yours, suitable for offering;’ whereby he means to say, ‘That wave of yours which is suitable for the sacrifice;’ ‘Mighty, most grateful;’ by ‘mighty’ he means to say ‘powerful,’ and by ‘most grateful’ he means to say ‘most sweet;’ ‘Give ye that unto those gods among the gods,’ in saying this he has craved it of them; ‘The drinkers of the pure (Soma);’ the pure, doubtless, is the truth; in saying, ‘the drinkers (pa) of the pure,’ he means to say, ‘the defenders (pa) of the truth;’ ‘Whose portion ye are, Hail!’ for this indeed is their portion.

<span id="v3_9_3_2626"><sup><small>3:9:3:2626.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he makes that oblation (ghee) float away by means of the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's cup, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 28), ‘Thou art furrowing!’ Even <span id="p235"><sup><small>[ p. 235 ]</small></sup></span> as a coal is consumed by Fire, so is that oblation consumed by that deity. Now that water, which is in the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's cup, he will have to pour on the king (Soma); and ghee being a thunderbolt, and Soma seed, he makes (the ghee) float away lest he should injure that seed, Soma, by that thunderbolt, the ghee.

<span id="v3_9_3_2727"><sup><small>3:9:3:2727.</small></sup></span>  He then takes (water) with, ‘I draw thee up for the imperishableness of the ocean;’ for the ocean is water; he thus confers imperishableness upon the waters; wherefore, in spite of so much food (and drink) being consumed, the waters are not diminished. Thereupon they draw (water in) the Ekadhana pitchers, and thereupon the vessels for washing the feet [^577].

<span id="v3_9_3_2828"><sup><small>3:9:3:2828.</small></sup></span>  The reason why he takes (water) with the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's cup is this. When the sacrifice escaped from the gods, the gods endeavoured to call it up by means of (sacrificial) calls (praisha) [^578]; by means of the puroru<i>k</i> (‘shining before’) formulas [^579] they pleased it (pra-ro<i>k</i>aya), and by the nivids they made (their wishes) known (ni-vid) to it. Therefore he takes (water) with the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's cup.

<span id="v3_9_3_2929"><sup><small>3:9:3:2929.</small></sup></span>  They come back. The Agnîdh takes up his position opposite to the pit with the Vasatîvarî water and the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup. Close over the pit he <span id="p236"><sup><small>[ p. 236 ]</small></sup></span> (the Adhvaryu) makes the Vasatîvarî water and the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's cup touch one another, with, ‘Water hath united with water, plants with plants!’ the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day, both kinds he thereby mixes together.

<span id="v3_9_3_3030"><sup><small>3:9:3:3030.</small></sup></span>  Now some indeed pour (some of) the Vasatîvarî water into the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's cup, and from the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's cup (back) to the Vasatîvarî water, arguing, ‘Thereby we mix together both the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day.’ But let him not do this; for when he pours (the water) together into the Âdhavanîya trough [^580], then both kinds of sap are mixed together. Thereupon he pours the Vasatîvarî water into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup for the Nigrâbhyâs [^581]. And as to why he makes them touch one another close over the pit, it was from thence, forsooth, that the gods rose to heaven; he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.

<span id="v3_9_3_3131"><sup><small>3:9:3:3131.</small></sup></span>  They return (to the Havirdhâna). The Hot<i>ri</i> asks him, ‘Adhvaryu, hast thou gained the waters?’ whereby he means to say, ‘Hast thou obtained the waters?’ He replies to him, ‘Yea, they have yielded themselves!’ whereby he means to say, ‘I have obtained them and they have yielded to me.’

<span id="v3_9_3_3232"><sup><small>3:9:3:3232.</small></sup></span>  And if it be an Agnish<i>t</i>oma, and there be left a residue (of ghee poured together) in the pra<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>î <span id="p237"><sup><small>[ p. 237 ]</small></sup></span> spoon sufficient for an oblation, let him offer that. But if it be not sufficient for an oblation, he takes another portion of ghee in four ladlings and offers it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 29; Rig-veda I, 27, 7), ‘Whatever mortal thou favourest in battles, whomsoever thou speedest in the race, he winneth unfailing strength, Hail!’ He offers with (a prayer) to Agni, because the Agnish<i>t</i>oma ('Agni's praise') means Agni; thus he establishes the Agnish<i>t</i>oma in Agni. \[He offers\] with (a verse) containing the word ‘mortal,’ because the Agnish<i>t</i>oma is of the same measure as man. Let hire then offer in this manner, if it be an Agnish<i>t</i>oma.

<span id="v3_9_3_3333"><sup><small>3:9:3:3333.</small></sup></span>  And if it be an Ukthya, let him touch the middle enclosing-stick,—there are three enclosing-sticks and three recitations (uktha) [^582]; and by means of them the sacrifice is there established. And if it be either an Atirâtra or a Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in [^583], let him neither make an oblation nor touch the middle enclosing-stick; having merely muttered (the above verse), let him silently betake himself (to the Havirdhâna) and enter it [^584]. In this way he duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice from one another.

<span id="v3_9_3_3434"><sup><small>3:9:3:3434.</small></sup></span>  The Ekadhana pitchers are always of uneven number,—either three, or five, or seven, or nine, or eleven, or thirteen, or fifteen [^585]. Now two and two <span id="p238"><sup><small>[ p. 238 ]</small></sup></span> (an even number) means a productive pair; and the one that remains over, remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity. And, moreover, that which remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity is the common property (sa-dhana) of these (others); and because it is the common property of these, therefore they are called Ekadhana (having one as their common property).


<span id="v3_9_4"><sup><small>3:9:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### B. THE PRÂTA<i>H</i>SAVANA, OR MORNING-PRESSING.

####1\. UPÂ<i>M</i><i>S</i>U-GRAHA.

<span id="v3_9_4_11"><sup><small>3:9:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon they sit down round the two press-boards [^586]. He (the Adhvaryu) then ties a piece of gold to that (nameless finger). For twofold, verily, is this; there is no third, namely, the truth and the untruth; the gods, forsooth, are the truth, and men are the untruth. And the gold has sprung from Agni's seed: ‘With the truth I will touch the stalks, with the truth I will take hold of Soma,’ thus he thinks, and therefore he ties a piece of gold to that (ring-finger).

<span id="v3_9_4_22"><sup><small>3:9:4:22.</small></sup></span>  He then takes a press-stone [^587]. Now those <span id="p239"><sup><small>[ p. 239 ]</small></sup></span> press-stones are of rock, and Soma is a god—for Soma was in the sky, Soma was V<i>ri</i>tra; those mountains, those rocks are his body—he thus perfects him by means of his body, makes him whole; therefore they are of rock. Moreover, in pressing him they slay him, they slay him by means of that (stone, Soma's own body); thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; therefore the press-stones are of rock.

<span id="v3_9_4_33"><sup><small>3:9:4:33.</small></sup></span>  He takes it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 30), ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i> I take thee with the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, with the hands of Pûshan; thou art a giver!’ For Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods; thus he takes it, impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>. ‘With the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins,’ he says,—the A<i>s</i>vins are the Adhvaryus (of the gods): with their arms he thus takes it, not with his own. ‘With the hands of Pûshan,’ he says,—Pûshan is the distributor of portions: with his hands he thus takes it, not with his own. Moreover, that (stone) is a thunderbolt, and no man can hold it: by means of those deities he takes it.

<span id="v3_9_4_44"><sup><small>3:9:4:44.</small></sup></span>  ‘I take thee: thou art a giver,’ he says; for when they press him by means of that (stone), then there is an oblation; and when he offers an oblation, then he gives sacrificial gifts,—thus, then, that (stone) gives twofold, oblations and sacrificial gifts; wherefore he says, ‘Thou art a giver.’

<span id="v3_9_4_55"><sup><small>3:9:4:55.</small></sup></span>  ‘Perform thou this deep cult!’ Cult means sacrifice; he thereby means to say, ‘Perform thou this great sacrifice!’—‘well-gotten for Indra;’ by ‘well-gotten’ he means to say, ‘well-produced;’ and Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, wherefore he says, ‘for Indra;’—‘by the most excellent bolt,’ <span id="p240"><sup><small>[ p. 240 ]</small></sup></span> for he, Soma, is indeed the most excellent bolt [^588], therefore he says, ‘by the most excellent bolt;’—‘the (cult) rich in food and sweetness and drink,’ whereby he means to say, ‘the (cult) rich in sap.’

<span id="v3_9_4_66"><sup><small>3:9:4:66.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he restrains-speech. For once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, ‘Let us sacrifice in a low voice, let us restrain speech!’ They sacrificed (with formulas muttered) in a low voice and restrained speech.

<span id="v3_9_4_77"><sup><small>3:9:4:77.</small></sup></span>  He then fetches the Nigrâbhyâs (waters), and makes him (the sacrificer) mutter over them [^589], ‘Ye are the Nigrâbhyâs, heard by the gods; satisfy me, satisfy my mind, satisfy my speech, satisfy my breath, satisfy mine eye, satisfy mine ear, satisfy my soul, satisfy mine offspring, satisfy my flocks, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!’ For water is sap, and over it he invokes this blessing, ‘Satisfy ye my whole self, satisfy my offspring, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!’ Now that Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>usavana (stone), forsooth, is in reality Âditya Vivasvant (the sun), it is the pervading vital air (vyâna) of this (sacrifice).

<span id="v3_9_4_88"><sup><small>3:9:4:88.</small></sup></span>  Thereon he metes out (the Soma). For in pressing him they slay him, they slay him by means of that (stone); thus [^590] he rises from hence, thus he <span id="p241"><sup><small>[ p. 241 ]</small></sup></span> lives. And because he metes him out, therefore there is a measure,—both the measure among men [^591], and what other measure there is.

<span id="v3_9_4_99"><sup><small>3:9:4:99.</small></sup></span>  He metes out with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 32), ‘Thee for Indra, with the Vasus, with the Rudras!’ For Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, ‘Thee for Indra;’ and by saying ‘with the Vasus, with the Rudras,’ he assigns a share, along with (or after) Indra, to the Vasus and the Rudras.—‘Thee for Indra, with the Âdityas!’ whereby he assigns a share to the Âdityas along with Indra.—‘Thee for Indra, the slayer of foes!’ a foe is an enemy: ‘Thee for Indra, the slayer of enemies,’ he means to say. This is his (Indra's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is this his special share apart from the (other) gods.

<span id="v3_9_4_1010"><sup><small>3:9:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  ‘Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon!’ this he metes out for Gâyatrî.—‘Thee for Agni, the bestower of growth of wealth!’ Now Agni is Gâyatrî: he metes this out for Gâyatrî. And since Gâyatrî, as a falcon, fetched Soma from heaven, therefore she is (called) the Soma-bearing falcon: for that prowess of hers he metes out (for her) a second portion.

<span id="v3_9_4_1111"><sup><small>3:9:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  Now as to why he metes out five times [^592],—the sacrifice is of the same measure as the year, and there are five seasons in the year: he takes possession of it in five (divisions); hence he metes out five times. <span id="p242"><sup><small>[ p. 242 ]</small></sup></span> 3:9:4:1212\. He touches it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 33), ‘What light of thine there is in the heavens, O Soma, what on earth, and what in the wide air, therewith make wide room for this sacrificer, for his prosperity: speak thou for the giver!’ Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods, he thought within himself, ‘I must not become sacrificial food for the gods with my whole self!’ Accordingly he deposited those three bodies of his in these worlds.

<span id="v3_9_4_1313"><sup><small>3:9:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  The gods then were victorious. They obtained those bodies by means of this same (formula), and he became entirely the sacrificial food of the gods. And in like manner does this (priest) now thereby obtain those bodies of his, and he (Soma) becomes entirely the food of the gods: this is why he thus touches it.

<span id="v3_9_4_1414"><sup><small>3:9:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then pours Nigrâbhyâ water on it. Now the waters, forsooth, slew V<i>ri</i>tra and by virtue of that prowess of theirs they now flow. Wherefore nothing whatsoever can check them when they flow; for they followed their own free will, thinking, ‘To whom, forsooth, should we submit (or stop), we by whom V<i>ri</i>tra was slain!’ Now all this (universe), whatsoever there is, had submitted [^593] to Indra, even he that blows yonder.

<span id="v3_9_4_1515"><sup><small>3:9:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  Indra spake, ‘Verily, all this (universe), whatsoever there is, has submitted unto me: submit ye also to me!’—They said, ‘What shall be our (reward) then?’—‘The first draught of king Soma shall be yours!’—‘So be it!’ thus they submitted to <span id="p243"><sup><small>[ p. 243 ]</small></sup></span> him; and they having submitted, he drew (ni-grabh) them to his breast; and because he thus drew them to his breast, therefore they are called Nigrâbhyâs. And in like manner does this sacrificer now draw them to his breast: and this is their first draught of king Soma, in that he pours Nigrâbhyâ water thereon.

<span id="v3_9_4_1616"><sup><small>3:9:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  He pours it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 34), ‘Ye are grateful, the subduers of V<i>ri</i>tra;’—the waters indeed are propitious: therefore he says, ‘Ye are grateful;’ and ‘the subduers of V<i>ri</i>tra’ he says because they did slay V<i>ri</i>tra;—‘the beneficent wives of the immortal (Soma);’ for the waters are immortal;—‘Ye goddesses, lead this sacrifice to the gods!’ there is nothing obscure in this; ‘Invited, drink ye of Soma!’ Thus invited they drink the first draught of king Soma.

<span id="v3_9_4_1717"><sup><small>3:9:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  Being about to beat (the Soma with the pressing-stone), let him think in his mind of him he hates: ‘Herewith I strike N.N., not thee!’ Now whosoever kills a human Brâhman here, he, forsooth, is deemed guilty [^594],—how much more so he who strikes him (Soma), for Soma is a god. But they do kill him when they press him;—they kill him with that (stone): thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; and thus no guilt is incurred.. But if he hate no one, he may even think of a straw, and thus no guilt is incurred.

<span id="v3_9_4_1818"><sup><small>3:9:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  He beats with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 35), ‘Fear not, tremble not!’ whereby he means to say, ‘Be not afraid, do not tremble, it is N.N. I strike, not thee!’—‘Take thou strength!’ whereby he means to say, ‘Take sap!’—‘Both ye bowls, that are <span id="p244"><sup><small>[ p. 244 ]</small></sup></span> firm, remain firm, take strength!’—‘Surely, it is those two (pressing-)boards that are thereby meant,’ so say some;—what, then, if one were to break those two boards [^595]? But, forsooth, it is these two, heaven and earth, that tremble for fear of that raised thunderbolt (the stone): hereby now he propitiates it for those two, heaven and earth; and thus propitiated it does not injure them. By ‘Take strength!’ he means to say, ‘Take sap!’—‘The evil is slain, not Soma!’ he thereby slays every evil of his.

<span id="v3_9_4_1919"><sup><small>3:9:4:1919.</small></sup></span>  Thrice he presses [^596], thrice he gathers together, <span id="p245"><sup><small>[ p. 245 ]</small></sup></span> four times he performs the Nigrâbha,—this makes ten, for of ten syllables consists the virâ<i>g</i>, and Soma is of virâ<i>g</i> nature: therefore he completes (the ceremony) in ten times.

<span id="v3_9_4_2020"><sup><small>3:9:4:2020.</small></sup></span>  Then as to why he performs the Nigrâbha. Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods, he set his heart on those (four) regions, thinking, ‘Could I but consort with those regions as my mate, my loved resort!’ By performing the Nigrâbha, the gods then made him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort; and in like manner does this (sacrificer) now, by performing the Nigrâbha, make him (Soma) consort with those regions as his mate, his loved resort.

<span id="v3_9_4_2121"><sup><small>3:9:4:2121.</small></sup></span>  He performs with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 36), ‘From east, from west, from north, from south—from every side may the regions resort to thee!’ whereby he makes him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort. ‘O mother, satisfy (him)! may the noble meet together [^597]!’ A mother <span id="p246"><sup><small>[ p. 246 ]</small></sup></span> (ambâ) is a woman, and the regions (di<i>s</i>, fem.) are women: therefore he says, ‘O mother, satisfy (him)!—May the noble meet together!’ The noble doubtless means people (creatures, offspring): he thus means to say, ‘May the people live in harmony with each other!’ Even the people that are far away (from each other) live in harmony with each other: therefore he says, ‘May the noble meet together.’

<span id="v3_9_4_2222"><sup><small>3:9:4:2222.</small></sup></span>  Now as to why he is called Soma. When he first became sacrificial food for the gods, he thought within him, ‘I must not become, sacrificial food for the gods with my whole self!’ That form of his which was most pleasing he accordingly put aside. Thereupon the gods were victorious; they said, ‘Draw that unto thee, for therewith shalt thou become our food!’ He drew it to him even from afar, saying, verily, that is mine own (svâ me): hence he was called Soma.

<span id="v3_9_4_2323"><sup><small>3:9:4:2323.</small></sup></span>  Then as to why he is called Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a (sacrifice). Now, when they press him, they slay him; and when they spread him [^598], they cause him to be born. He is born in being spread along, he is born moving (yan gâyate): hence yan-<i>g</i>a, for ‘ya<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a’ they say, is the same as ‘ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a.’

<span id="v3_9_4_2424"><sup><small>3:9:4:2424.</small></sup></span>  Also this speech did he then utter (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 37; <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> Rig-veda I, 84, 19), ‘Verily thou, a god, shalt extol the mortal, O most mighty! than thee there is no other giver of joy [^599], O lord! unto thee do I speak this word, O Indra!’ For it was indeed as a mortal that he uttered this, ‘Thou alone wilt produce (me) from here, no other but thee!’

<span id="v3_9_4_2525"><sup><small>3:9:4:2525.</small></sup></span>  And from the Nigrâbhyâ water they draw the several grahas (cups or libations of Soma). For it was the waters that slew V<i>ri</i>tra, and in virtue of this prowess they flow; and it is from flowing water that he takes the Vasatîvarî water, and from the Vasatîvarî the Nigrâbhyâ water; and from the Nigrâbhyâ water the several grahas are drawn. In virtue of that prowess, then, the grahas are drawn from the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup. Now the Hot<i>ri</i> means the <i>Ri</i>k (fem.), a woman; and from woman creatures are born here on earth: hence he makes him (Soma) to be born from that woman, the <i>Ri</i>k, the Hot<i>ri</i>; wherefore (he takes the grahas) from the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup.

[^559]: 223:2 Or perhaps, ‘I will take it while I see the sap of the sacrifice.’

[^560]: 223:3 ‘Vasatîvarî’ seems to mean ‘affording dwelling;’ or perhaps, ‘that (water) which abides, remains (over night).’ Cf. [par. 16](../Book_2_3_9#v3_9_2_16).

[^566]: 226:1 Cf. Taitt. S. VI, 4, 2, ‘devâ<i>h</i> . . . abruvan, vasatu nu na idam iti, tad vasatîvarî<i>n</i>â<i>m</i> vasatîvaritvam.’

[^567]: 226:2 After performing their ablutions they have to perform the preliminary work and ceremonies, such as preparing the Gârhapatya, fetching and arranging the vessels, cleaning of spoons, &c. up to the depositing of the ghee, near the high altar.

[^568]: 227:1 According to Kâty. VIII, 9, 24-25, on the previous evening,—immediately after the carrying round And depositing of the Vasatîvarî water,—the Soma is placed on a seat (âsandi) in the Âgnîdhra fire house, where the sacrificer has to watch over it during that night. This is not mentioned in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and from what follows it would rather seem that the Soma is taken down from the cart (see III, 6, 3, 17 seq.). Otherwise we might translate, ‘He brings him down (from the Âgnîdhra).’

[^569]: 227:2 That is, with their broad sides turned towards each other.

[^570]: 228:1 ‘He commits a pâpavasyasa<i>m</i>,’ i.e. according to Haug, Ait. Br. p. 413, ‘a breach of the oath of allegiance,’ (where Sâya<i>n</i>a explains it by ‘exceedingly bad’); or ‘an (act of) perversity,’ Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 300. Sâya<i>n</i>a, to our passage, explains it by ‘mixing the bad with the good (or better).’ The literal translation is ‘a bad-bettering.’ What is chiefly implied in the term is evidently the showing of disrespect by an inferior to a superior person.

[^573]: 229:2 The Prâtar-anuvâka, or morning-prayer (matin chant), has to be recited by the Hot<i>ri</i> in the latter part of the night before any sound (of birds, &c.) is to be heard. It may begin immediately after midnight, and conclude as soon as daylight appears. When called upon by the Adhvaryu to recite the morning-prayer, the Hot<i>ri</i> first makes an oblation of ghee on the Âgnîdhra fire, with the mantra, ‘Protect me from the spell of the mouth, from every imprecation, Hail!’ and then two oblations on the Âhavanîya with appropriate mantras. Thereupon he betakes himself to the Havirdhâna (cart-shed), in entering which, by the east door, he touches successively the front-wreath (rarâ<i>t</i>â, cf. [III, 5, 3, 9](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_3_9)) and the doorposts, with formulas. He then squats down between the yoke-pieces of the two Soma-carts, and begins his recitation with Rig-veda X, 30, 12, ‘Ye, O wealthy waters, verily possess good things; ye confer desirable energy and immortality; ye command riches with abundant offspring: may Sarasvatî (the river S., and Speech) bestow on the bard that vital vigour!’ The ‘early-coming’ deities to whom the recitation is successively addressed, are Agni, Ushas (the dawn), and the two A<i>s</i>vins (the precursors of the sun); the prayer thus consisting of three sections, termed kratu (Agnikratu p. 230, &c.). The hymns and detached verses making up these sections are arranged according to the seven metres (thus forming seven sub-sections of each), viz. gâyatrî, anush<i>t</i>ubh, trish<i>t</i>ubh, b<i>ri</i>hatî, ush<i>n</i>ih, <i>g</i>agatî, and paṅkti. The prayer may consist of as many verses as can be recited between midnight and daybreak; but there should be at least one hymn in each of the seven metres to each of the three deities; nor should the recitation consist of less than a hundred verses. From the beginning of the recitation up to the end of the last hymn but one, Rig-veda I, 112, there is to be a gradual modulation of the voice so as to pass upwards through the seven tones (yama) of the deep scale (mandrasvara). Moreover, that hymn is to be repeated (if necessary) till daylight appears. As soon as this is the case, he passes on without any break from the last (25th) verse to the last hymn (v. 75, 1-9), which he intones in the lowest tone of the middle scale, after shifting his place further east towards the gate. The recitation of the first eight verses of this hymn again gradually ascends through the whole of the middle scale; when—after once more shifting his place so as to be seated between the two door-posts—he intones the last verse—‘The Dawn hath appeared with her shining kine, Agni hath been kindled at his appointed time: your car hath been yoked, ye mighty, mead-loving(?) A<i>s</i>vins, showerers of wealth, hear my call!’ in reciting which he makes his voice pass through the several tones of the high scale. The Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ, likewise, has to chant the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ litany (see [III, 3, 4, 17](../Book_2_3_3#v3_3_4_17) seq.)—as he had to do on the previous evening—inserting in it the names of the sacrificer's father and son. The Agnîdh, in the meantime, prepares the five havis-oblations (savanîyâ<i>h</i> puro<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>â<i>h</i>) to be offered at the morning-pressing (cf. [IV, 2, 4, 18](../Book_2_4_2#v4_2_4_18)), and the Unnet<i>ri</i> puts the numerous Soma-vessels in their respective places on the khara, and about the Soma-carts.

[^574]: 231:1 Cf. [IV, 3, 2, 1](../Book_2_4_3#v4_3_2_1) seq.

[^575]: 231:2 That is, when he recites the last verse, ‘Ushas hath appeared,’ &c.

[^576]: 231:3 Literally, ‘Bend together (sa<i>m</i>\-nam),’ which refers to the ‘bending together’ of the cups at the Aponaptrîya ceremony.

[^577]: 232:1 The text has rather to be construed, ‘Ye stones, hear (my prayer) as (of one) knowing the sacrifice.’

[^578]: 232:2 While the Adhvaryu and assistants go to the water to fill the Ekadhana pitchers, the Hot<i>ri</i> recites the so-called Aponaptrîya hymn (Rig-veda X, 30) to the waters, omitting verse twelve, which was already recited as the opening verse of the morning-prayer. The first verse is recited thrice, and the tenth verse is recited after the eleventh, while the priests are returning with the water. As soon as they are in sight, the Hot<i>ri</i> recites verse 13, followed by Rig-veda V, 43, 1; and (when the Ekadhanâ and Vasatîvarî waters meet together, [paragraph 29](../Book_2_3_9#v3_9_3_29)) Rig-veda II, 35, 3; and, in case some of the water is actually poured over into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup, I, 83, 2. When the water is brought to the Havirdhâna, the Hot<i>ri</i> addresses the Adhvaryu as stated in [paragraph 31](../Book_2_3_9#v3_9_3_31); whereupon he pronounces a ‘nigada’ (for which see Ait. Br. II, 20; Â<i>s</i>v. Sr. V, 1, 14-17), followed by Rig-veda I, 23, i6; while the Ekadhana pitchers are carried past him. The water in the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a cup and one third of both the Vasatîvarî and Ekadhanâ water having been poured into the Âdhavanîya trough (standing on the northern cart), the pitchers with the remaining water are then deposited in their respective places behind the axle of the northern cart, whereupon the Hot<i>ri</i> recites the two remaining verses (24 and 15) of the p. 233 Aponaptrîya hymn, and sits down in front of the Soma, behind the northern door-post of the Havirdhâna (cart-shed).

[^579]: 235:1 These are filled by the sacrificer's wife, or, if there be more than one sacrificer (or, if the sacrificer have more than one wife), by all the wives, each having two vessels. For the use of this water, see note on [IV, 4, 2, 18](../Book_2_4_4#v4_4_2_18).

[^580]: 235:2 The praishas or sacrificial directions to the Hot<i>ri</i>, for the recitations of offering-formulas, are given by the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a; see [p. 183](../Book_2_3_7#p183), note [2](../Book_2_3_7#fn462).

[^583]: 236:2 Nigrâbhyâ<i>h</i> is the technical name the Vasatîvarî water in the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup henceforth bears. It is handed to the sacrificer to carry to the Havirdhâna; and is afterwards used for moistening the Soma plants (or, for being poured thereon) at the time of the pressing. See [III, 9, 4, 14](../Book_2_3_9#v3_9_4_14) seq.

[^584]: 237:1 See note on IV, 4, 2, 18; Haug, Ait. Br., Transl. p. 251.

[^587]: 237:4 The original has,—either three, or five, or five, or seven, or seven, or nine, &e. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text, on the other hand, has merely,—either three, or five, or sevens or nine, or nineteen.

[^588]: 238:1 The Adhvaryu and sacrificer sit north of them, looking towards the south; and the assistants of the former—viz. the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>; Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, and Unnet<i>ri</i>\—on the south side, looking northwards. The press-boards were laid down on the ‘sound-holes,’ under the fore-part of the southern Soma-cart, and the pressing-skin was spread over them; see [III, 5, 4, 22](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_4_22)\-[23](../Book_2_3_5#v3_5_4_23). The Udgât<i>ri</i>s, or chanters, are seated behind the carts.

[^589]: 238:2 Viz. the upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>usavana, or ‘low-voiced pressing (stone),’ (see paragraph [6](../Book_2_3_9#v3_9_4_6),) with which the Soma for the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u libation (or cup, graha) is pressed.

[^590]: 240:1 It is doubtful what ‘pavi’ may mean here. It seems to mean originally a metallic mounting, especially of a shaft. The commentators explain it by ‘thunderbolt.’

[^591]: 240:2 The sacrificer holds the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup with the Nigrâbhyâ<i>h</i> to his breast.

[^592]: 240:3 Viz. by being placed upon the stone. which is identical with the sun (?); but cf. [III, 8, 2, 27](../Book_2_3_8#v3_8_2_27).

[^594]: 241:2 According to Taitt. S. VI, 4, 4 he metes out five times with the above texts, and five times silently.

[^595]: 242:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va MS. has twice ‘tatsthâna,’ as Ait. Br. VI, 5, and twice ‘tasthâna;’ cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 295.

[^596]: 243:1 ‘Pari<i>k</i>akshate’ ought rather to mean ‘they despise him.’

[^597]: 244:1 That is to say, in that case the formula would prove to have been a failure. According to the Taitt. Kalpas., quoted to Taitt. S. I, 4, 1 (p. 590), he presses the skin down upon the two press-boards while muttering this formula. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text argues somewhat differently,—ime evaitat phalake âhur iti haika âhus tad u kim âdriyeta yad athaite bhidyeyâtâm eveme haiva dyâvâp<i>ri</i>thivyâv etasmâd va<i>g</i>râd udyatât sa<i>m</i>re<i>g</i>ete,—‘Some say those two boards are thereby meant; but who would care if they should get broken; for it is rather those two, heaven and earth,’ &c.?

[^598]: 244:2 The pressing of the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u-graha—also called the ‘small’ pressing, distinguished from the ‘great pressing’ (mahâbhishava) for the subsequent cups or libations (graha)—consists of three turns of eight, eleven, and twelve single beatings respectively. Before each turn Nigrâbhyâ water is poured upon the Soma plants by the sacrificer from the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup. After each turn of pressing the Adhvaryu throws the completely-pressed stalks into the cup, and when they have become thoroughly soaked, he presses them out and takes them out again; this being the ‘gathering together’ referred to above. At the same time he mutters the Nigrâbha formula ([paragraph 21](../Book_2_3_9#v3_9_4_21)); after which the pressed-out juice, absorbed by the water, is poured into the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel in the following manner. Before the pressing the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> had taken six Soma-stalks, and put two each between the fingers of his left hand. After each turn of pressing he takes the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel with his right hand and holds one pair of the Soma-stalks over it (or, according to others, all six at the same time), through which (as through p. 245 a strainer) the Adhvaryu then pours the Soma-juice from the pressing-skin into the vessel. After the third turn the pressing-stone itself is put into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup, either with or without the muttering of the Nigrâbha formula. According to the commentary on Kâty. IX, 4, 27, the Soma-juice is transferred from the skin to the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u cup, by the straining-cloth being made to imbibe the juice and then being pressed out so as to trickle down through the plants between the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>'s fingers. The description given by Haug, Ait. Br., Transl. p. 489, is somewhat different.

[^599]: 245:1 The interpretation of this formula is very doubtful. The author evidently takes ‘arî<i>h</i>’ as nom. plur. of ‘ari’ (= ârya); but it does not appear how he takes ‘nishpara,’ while Mahîdhara explains it by ‘pûraya (give him, Soma, his fill).’ The St. Petersburg Dict. suggests that ‘nishpara’ may mean ‘come out!’ and that ‘arî<i>h</i>’ seems to be a nom. sing. here. I take the last part of the formula to mean, ‘May he (Soma) win (or, perhaps, join) the longing (waters)!’ p. 246 some of the Nigrâbhyâ water being poured on the Soma at each turn of pressing; and small stalks of Soma being, besides, thrown into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup containing that water. As to the first part of the formula, it may perhaps mean, ‘Well, pour out (or, pour forth, intrans.).’ Professor Ludwig, Rig-veda IV, p. xvi, thinks that ‘nishpara’ is a correction of the Taitt, reading ‘nishvara,’ which Sâya<i>n</i>a interprets, ‘O mother (Soma), come out (from the stalks, in the form of juice),’ and according to the Sûtra quoted by him, the sacrificer is at the same time to think of the wife he loves.

[^600]: 246:1 That is, when they perform the Soma-sacrifice.

[^601]: 247:1 This is the traditional meaning (sukhayit<i>ri</i>) assigned to mar<i>d</i>ayit<i>ri</i> (the merciful, comforter); but it is not quite clear how the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a interprets it.
