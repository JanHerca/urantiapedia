## FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v4_4_1_11"><sup><small>4:4:1:11.</small></sup></span>  Savit<i>ri</i>, forsooth, is his [^833] mind: therefore he draws the Sâvitra cup. And, forsooth, Savit<i>ri</i> is his breath (vital air);—when he draws the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u cup, then he puts into him that vital air in front; and when he draws the Sâvitra cup, then he puts into him that vital air behind: thus those two vital airs on both sides are beneficial (or, put into him), both that which is above and that which is below.

<span id="v4_4_1_22"><sup><small>4:4:1:22.</small></sup></span>  And the sacrifice, forsooth, is the seasons, the year. There, at the morning feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the cups for the seasons; and at the midday feast they are covertly attended to, in that he takes the Marutvatîya libations by means of the two Ritu vessels [^834]. Now here (at the evening feast) they neither draw any libation expressly for the seasons, nor is any libation taken with the two Ritu vessels. <span id="p358">[<sup><small>p. 358</small></sup>]</span> 4:4:1:33\. But Savit<i>ri</i>, forsooth, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and he indeed is all the seasons: thus the seasons, the year, are overtly attended to at the evening feast,—for this reason he draws the Sâvitra cup.

<span id="v4_4_1_44"><sup><small>4:4:1:44.</small></sup></span>  He draws it with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel. For Savit<i>ri</i> is his mind, and the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u is his breath: therefore he draws it with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel; or with the Antaryâma vessel, for that is one and the same, since the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma are the out-breathing and in-breathing [^835].

<span id="v4_4_1_55"><sup><small>4:4:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He draws it from the Âgraya<i>n</i>a graha; for Savit<i>ri</i> is his mind, and the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is his body (or self): he thus puts the mind into the body. Savit<i>ri</i> is his breath, and the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is his body: he thus puts the breath into the body.

<span id="v4_4_1_66"><sup><small>4:4:1:66.</small></sup></span>  He thus draws it therefrom with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 6; Rig-veda VI, 71, 6), 'Bring thou forth boons for us this day, O Savitar, boons to-morrow, boons day by day: O God, through this our prayer may we be sharers of boons, of a good and plenteous abode!—Thou art taken with a support!—Thou art Savit<i>ri</i>'s joy-giver, thou art a joy-giver: give me joy! speed the sacrifice; speed the lord of the sacrifice to (receive) his share!’

<span id="v4_4_1_77"><sup><small>4:4:1:77.</small></sup></span>  Having drawn it, he does not deposit it; for Savit<i>ri</i> is his (Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a's) mind, and hence this mind is restless. And Savit<i>ri</i> is his breath: hence this breath passes to and fro unrestingly. He then says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the god Savit<i>ri</i>!’ Having called for the <span id="p359">[<sup><small>p. 359</small></sup>]</span> <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite the offering prayer) to the god Savit<i>ri</i>!’ The Vasha<i>t</i> having been pronounced, he offers. He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces no Anuvasha<i>t</i> [^836],—for Savit<i>ri</i> is his mind,—‘lest he should consign his mind to the fire;’ and Savit<i>ri</i> being his breath,—‘lest he should consign his breath to the fire.’

<span id="v4_4_1_88"><sup><small>4:4:1:88.</small></sup></span>  Then with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom [^837], he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha. The reason why he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom, is this: on the Sâvitra graha he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces no Anuvasha<i>t</i>, and it is therefrom that he is about to draw the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha,—thus it is by means of the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva that it becomes supplied with the Anuvasha<i>t</i> for him.

<span id="v4_4_1_99"><sup><small>4:4:1:99.</small></sup></span>  And further why he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha. Savit<i>ri</i>, forsooth, is his rind, and the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i> (All-gods, or all the gods [^838]) are everything here: he thus makes everything here subservient and obedient to the mind, and hence everything here is subservient and obedient to the mind.

<span id="v4_4_1_1010"><sup><small>4:4:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  And again why he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha. Savit<i>ri</i>, forsooth, is his breath, and the All-gods are everything here: he thereby puts the out-breathing and in-breathing into everything here, and <span id="p360">[<sup><small>p. 360</small></sup>]</span> thus the out-breathing and in-breathing become beneficial (or put) in everything here.

<span id="v4_4_1_1111"><sup><small>4:4:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  And again why he draws the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha. The evening feast belongs to the All-gods: thus indeed it is called on the part of the Sâman, in that the evening feast is called Vai<i>s</i>vadeva on the part of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> [^839], and in the same way on the part of the Ya<i>g</i>us, by way of preparatory rite, when he draws that Mahâ-vai<i>s</i>vadeva graha.

<span id="v4_4_1_1212"><sup><small>4:4:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  He draws it from the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t; for the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t belongs to the All-gods, because therefrom they draw (Soma juice) for the gods, therefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers: hence the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t belongs to the All-gods.

<span id="v4_4_1_1313"><sup><small>4:4:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  He draws it without a puroru<i>k</i> [^840], for he draws it for the All-gods, and the All-gods are everything, the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Ya<i>g</i>us and Sâman; and even in that he draws it for the All-gods, thereby it becomes supplied with a puroru<i>k</i> for him: therefore he draws it without a puroru<i>k</i>.

<span id="v4_4_1_1414"><sup><small>4:4:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  He thus draws it therefrom with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 8), ‘Thou art taken with a support: thou art well-guarded, well-established,’—for well-guarded and well-established is the breath,—‘homage to the great bull!’—the great bull is Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures): ‘homage to Pra<i>g</i>âpati,’ he thereby means to say.—‘Thee to the All-gods! this is thy womb,—thee to the All-gods!’ Therewith he <span id="p361">[<sup><small>p. 361</small></sup>]</span> deposits it; for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. Thereupon he goes (to the Sadas) and sits down (in front of the Hot<i>ri</i>) with his face to the east [^841].

<span id="v4_4_1_1515"><sup><small>4:4:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  And when he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites this (verse), ‘With one and ten for thine own sake, with two and twenty for offering, with three and thirty for up-bearing (the sacrifice to the gods); with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou here unloose them!’—during (the recitation of) this verse to Vâyu the drinking-vessels are unyoked [^842], for beasts have Vâyu for their leader; and Vâyu <span id="p362">[<sup><small>p. 362</small></sup>]</span> (wind) is breath, since it is by means of the breath that beasts move about.

<span id="v4_4_1_1616"><sup><small>4:4:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  Now once on a time he went away from the gods with the beasts. The gods called after him at the morning pressing,—he returned not. They called after him at the midday pressing,—but he returned not. They called after him at the evening pressing.

<span id="v4_4_1_1717"><sup><small>4:4:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  Being about to return, he said, ‘If I were to return to you, what would be my reward? ’—‘By thee these vessels would be yoked, and by thee they would be unloosed!’—Hence those vessels are yoked by that (Vâyu), when he (the Adhvaryu) draws the (cups) for Indra and Vâyu and so forth [^843]. And now those vessels are unloosed by him, when he says, ‘with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou here unloose them;’—teams mean cattle: thus he unlooses those vessels by means of cattle.

<span id="v4_4_1_1818"><sup><small>4:4:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  Now, had he returned at the morning pressing—the morning pressing belonging to the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî being the priesthood [^844]\—then cattle would have come to be with priests only. And had he returned at the midday pressing—the midday pressing belonging to Indra, and Indra being the nobility—cattle would have come to be with nobles only. But in that he returned at the evening pressing—the evening pressing belonging to the All-gods, and the All-gods being everything here—therefore there are cattle everywhere here.


<span id="p363">[<sup><small>p. 363</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="v4_4_2"><sup><small>4:4:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v4_4_2_11"><sup><small>4:4:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He proceeds with (the offering of) Soma's rice-pap; for Soma is the sacrificial food of the gods; and here now sacrificial food is prepared for Soma on his part; and thus Soma is not excluded therefrom. It is a rice-pap (<i>k</i>aru), for rice-pap is food for the gods, since rice-pap is boiled rice, and boiled rice is clearly food: therefore it is a rice-pap.

<span id="v4_4_2_22"><sup><small>4:4:2:22.</small></sup></span>  Neither at the morning feast, nor at the midday feast does he offer it, for those two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are the exclusive feasts of the gods; and Soma is sacred to the Fathers [^845].

<span id="v4_4_2_33"><sup><small>4:4:2:33.</small></sup></span>  But were he to offer it at the morning feast, or at the midday feast, he would cause discord between the gods and Fathers. He offers it at the evening feast, because the evening feast belongs to the All-gods [^846]: thus he does not cause discord. He recites no invitatory prayer (but only an offering prayer), for the Fathers have passed away once for all: hence he recites no invitatory prayer.

<span id="v4_4_2_44"><sup><small>4:4:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Having, in the first place, taken ghee in four ladlings, and having called (on the Agnîdh) for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Recite the offering prayer of the ghee!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered. Whatever oblations have been offered previous to this (<i>k</i>aru), therefrom he separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord. <span id="p364">[<sup><small>p. 364</small></sup>]</span> 4:4:2:55\. Having poured (into the spoon) an ‘underlayer’ of ghee, he makes two cuttings from the rice-pap; and bastes them with ghee above. Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Recite the offering prayer of the Saumya (rice-pap)!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered.

<span id="v4_4_2_66"><sup><small>4:4:2:66.</small></sup></span>  He then takes ghee a second time by four ladlings, and having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Recite the offering prayer of the ghee!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered. From whatever oblations he intends to offer hereafter, he thereby separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord. If he chooses, he may offer (ghee) on both sides (before and after the Soma's rice-pap); or, if he chooses, he may offer on one side only [^847].

<span id="v4_4_2_77"><sup><small>4:4:2:77.</small></sup></span>  Now there is an offering-spoon called ‘pra<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>î.’ Therein the Adhvaryu takes ghee by four ladlings (with the dipping-spoon) and pours it on the Dhish<i>n</i>ya hearths by means of fagots (held over them). The reason why he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots is this. Because, on a former occasion [^848], the gods said to those (Gandharva <span id="p365">[<sup><small>p. 365</small></sup>]</span> Soma-wardens), ‘At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering,’ that same offering of ghee now falls to their share at the evening pressing, but not one of Soma, in that he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots. One after another, in the order in which they were thrown up, and with the same formulas [^849], he pours ghee upon them; on the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya last of all.

<span id="v4_4_2_88"><sup><small>4:4:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Now some make a second pouring on the Âgnîdhrîya hearth, thinking, ‘In the North (or upwards) shall this sacred work of ours be accomplished!’ but let him not do it in this way, but rather the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya last [^850].

<span id="v4_4_2_99"><sup><small>4:4:2:99.</small></sup></span>  Now, while the Adhvaryu pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> draws the Pâtnîvata [^851] cup. For from the sacrifice creatures are produced; and being produced from the sacrifice, they are produced from union; and being produced from union, they are produced from the hind part of the sacrifice;—hence he thereby produces them from a productive union, from the hind part of the sacrifice: therefore he draws the Pâtnîvata cup.

<span id="v4_4_2_1010"><sup><small>4:4:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  He draws it with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel. If he <span id="p366">[<sup><small>p. 366</small></sup>]</span> draws the Sâvitra libation with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel, (he draws) this one with the Antaryâma vessel; and if he draws the Sâvitra with the Antaryâma vessel (he draws) this one with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel;—for one and the same indeed are the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma, being breath, and that which is the out-breathing is also the in-breathing. Now the breath (prâ<i>n</i>a, masc.) is male, and the wife is female: a productive union is thus brought about.

<span id="v4_4_2_1111"><sup><small>4:4:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  He draws it without a puroru<i>k</i> [^852],—-the puroru<i>k</i> being manhood,—lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he draws it without a puroru<i>k</i>.

<span id="v4_4_2_1212"><sup><small>4:4:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  He thus draws it from that (Âgraya<i>n</i>a graha) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 9), ‘Thou art taken with a support: Of thee, divine Soma, begotten by B<i>ri</i>haspati’—B<i>ri</i>haspati is the priesthood: of thee, divine Soma, the priest-begotten' he thereby means to say—‘Of thee, the potent juice of the powerful (manly) juice’ he means to say when he says ‘of thee, the potent juice’—‘May I prosper the draughts of thee, the mated one [^853]!’ he does not now draw it for the wives, lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he does not now draw it for the wives.

<span id="v4_4_2_1313"><sup><small>4:4:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) then mixes it with the residue (of ghee) which is left in the pra<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>î spoon. Now other libations he completes by mixing, but this one he diminishes; for ghee is a thunderbolt, <span id="p367">[<sup><small>p. 367</small></sup>]</span> and by that thunderbolt, the ghee, the gods smote the wives and unmanned them, and thus smitten and unmanned they neither owned any self nor did they own any heritage. And in like manner does he now, by that thunderbolt, the ghee, smite the wives and unman them; and thus smitten and unmanned, they neither own [^854] any self nor do they own any heritage.

<span id="v4_4_2_1414"><sup><small>4:4:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  He mixes it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 9), ‘I am above, I am below; and what space there is between, that was my father;—I saw the sun on both sides: I am what is highest to the gods in secret.’ In that he mixes with ‘I—I,’ thereby he bestows manhood on men.

<span id="v4_4_2_1515"><sup><small>4:4:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  He then says, ‘Agnîdh, pronounce the offering prayer of the Pâtnîvata!’ The Agnîdh is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is brought about. He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 10), ‘O Agni, wife-leader [^855]!’—Agni is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is brought about.

<span id="v4_4_2_1616"><sup><small>4:4:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  ‘Together with the divine Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>’—for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> transforms the cast seed: thus he thereby transforms the cast seed;—‘drink the Soma, Hail!’ therewith he offers on the north (left) part (of the fire); what other offerings there are, they are the gods, and these are the wives: thus alone it is a proper union, since the woman lies on the left (north) side of the man. The Adhvaryu takes a draught of Soma to the Agnîdh, and the latter says, ‘Adhvaryu, invite me!’ \[It might be said <span id="p368">[<sup><small>p. 368</small></sup>]</span> that\] he should not invite him, since how can there be an invitation of one smitten and unmanned? He should nevertheless invite him: they offer in his fire, and utter the Vasha<i>t</i>,—therefore he should invite him.

<span id="v4_4_2_1717"><sup><small>4:4:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  He then gives orders, 'Agnîdh, sit in the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>'s lap! Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, lead up the lady, and make her exchange looks with the Udgât<i>ri</i>! Unnet<i>ri</i>, fill up the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup, and let no Soma-juice remain!' Thus, if it be an Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice.

<span id="v4_4_2_1818"><sup><small>4:4:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  But if it be an Ukthya [^856], let him say, ‘Lengthen out the Soma!’—Holding the same vessel (from which the Pâtnîvata libation was made, the Agnîdh) sits down in the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>'s lap,—for he, the Agnîdh, is in reality Agni, and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> is female: the Agnîdh is male, and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> female,—a productive union is thus brought about. The Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> leads up the lady and makes her exchange looks with the Udgât<i>ri</i> [^857], with ‘Thou art Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the <span id="p369">[<sup><small>p. 369</small></sup>]</span> male, the bestower of seed: lay thou seed into me!’ The Udgât<i>ri</i> is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the lady is a woman: a productive union is thus brought about.


<span id="v4_4_3"><sup><small>4:4:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v4_4_3_11"><sup><small>4:4:3:11.</small></sup></span>  The metres, forsooth, are the (draught) cattle of the gods. Even as harnessed cattle here on earth <span id="p370">[<sup><small>p. 370</small></sup>]</span> draw for men, so do the harnessed metres draw the sacrifice for the gods. And whenever the metres gratified the gods, then the gods gratified the metres. Now it has been previous to this, that the harnessed metres have drawn the sacrifice to the gods, that they have gratified them [^858]:

<span id="v4_4_3_22"><sup><small>4:4:3:22.</small></sup></span>  He now draws the Hâriyo<i>g</i>ana [^859] graha—the Hâriyo<i>g</i>ana being the metres—it is the metres he thereby gratifies: this is why he draws the Hâriyo<i>g</i>ana graha.

<span id="v4_4_3_33"><sup><small>4:4:3:33.</small></sup></span>  He draws it as an additional (libation); since <span id="p371">[<sup><small>p. 371</small></sup>]</span> he draws it when he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces the ‘All-hail and blessing [^860].’ For there are here the gods, and the metres in addition to them; and there are men, and beasts in addition to them: therefore he draws it as an additional one.

<span id="v4_4_3_44"><sup><small>4:4:3:44.</small></sup></span>  He draws it in the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a. Now Soma was V<i>ri</i>tra. When the gods slew him, his head rolled off [^861]: it became the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a. Thereinto flowed together so much of the juice as it could hold [^862]; that was in excess; and so is this graha in excess: he thus puts the excess. to the excess,—therefore he draws it in the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a.

<span id="v4_4_3_55"><sup><small>4:4:3:55.</small></sup></span>  He draws it without a puroru<i>k</i>\-formula, for he draws it for the metres; and in that he draws it for the metres, even thereby that (graha) of his becomes supplied with a puroru<i>k</i>: therefore he draws it without a puroru<i>k</i>.

<span id="v4_4_3_66"><sup><small>4:4:3:66.</small></sup></span>  He now draws it from that (Âgraya<i>n</i>a graha) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, it), ‘Thou art taken with a support: of bay colour art thou, meet for the team of bay steeds,—thee to the pair of bay steeds!’ Now, the two bay horses are the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Sâman: it is for the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Sâman that he draws it.

<span id="v4_4_3_77"><sup><small>4:4:3:77.</small></sup></span>  He then pours parched grain into it with, ‘Ye are the bays’ grains, united with the Soma for <span id="p372">[<sup><small>p. 372</small></sup>]</span> Indra!’ Whatever metres there are, both measured and unmeasured, they all thereby drink (of the Soma [^863]).

<span id="v4_4_3_88"><sup><small>4:4:3:88.</small></sup></span>  For this (libation) the Unnet<i>ri</i> [^864] calls for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>;—for the Unnet<i>ri</i> is in excess (additional), since he does not call for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i> for any other (libation); and this libation also is in excess: thus he puts the excess to the excess,—therefore the Unnet<i>ri</i> calls for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>.

<span id="v4_4_3_99"><sup><small>4:4:3:99.</small></sup></span>  Placing (the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a) on his head, he calls for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>,—for this (vessel) is his (Soma's) head. He first says (to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a), ‘Recite (the invitatory prayer) for the Soma-draughts with grains!’ Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Prompt (the Hot<i>ri</i> to pronounce the offering prayer on) the Soma-draughts with grain brought forward [^865]!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> and Anuvasha<i>t</i> are uttered. They then divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.

<span id="v4_4_3_1010"><sup><small>4:4:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  Now some take the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a over to the Hot<i>ri</i>, on the ground that ‘the draught belongs to the utterer of the Vasha<i>t</i>.’ But let him not do it thus; for the other draughts are (taken by the respective priests) according to the <i>k</i>amasa cups, but this one is in excess: therefore there is a draught in it for all of them,—for this reason they divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught. <span id="p373">[<sup><small>p. 373</small></sup>]</span> 4:4:3:1111\. They must not bite them with their teeth,—for these (grains) mean cattle,—thinking ‘lest we should do aught to crush our cattle!’ They only drink it in with their breath [^866], with (Vâ,;. S. VIII, 12), ‘What horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine [^867];’ for they are cattle: therefore he says, ‘what horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine;’—‘Of that draught, offered with Ya<i>g</i>us, praised by chants [^868],’—for Ya<i>g</i>us-prayers have indeed been offered, and chants have been chanted;—‘sung by hymns,’—for songs (<i>s</i>astras) have been sung;—‘Of the invited [^869] do I drink, invited,’—for invited, he now drinks of the invited.

<span id="v4_4_3_1212"><sup><small>4:4:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  They must not throw them into the fire, lest they offer remains (of offerings) in the fire. They rather throw them on the high altar: thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice.

<span id="v4_4_3_1313"><sup><small>4:4:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon they touch the vessels filled (with water [^870]) which some call Apsushomâ<i>h</i> (Soma-draughts in water). For even as a yoked (animal) draws, so <span id="p374">[<sup><small>p. 374</small></sup>]</span> do they who perform the priestly duties. But the yoked (animal) galls or scratches itself; and water is a means of soothing, a medicine: thus wherever in this (sacrifice) they gall or scratch themselves—water being a means of soothing—they soothe by that means of soothing, water; they heal it by water. This is why they touch the vessels filled (with water).

<span id="v4_4_3_1414"><sup><small>4:4:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  They touch them with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 14), ‘With lustre, with sap, with bodies [^871] have we united,—with the happy spirit: may Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and may he smooth what was injured in our body!’ thus they heal what was torn.

<span id="v4_4_3_1515"><sup><small>4:4:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  They then touch their faces. There is a twofold reason why they touch their faces;—water, forsooth, is the elixir of immortality: it is with the elixir of immortality that they thus touch themselves. And, moreover, they thus deposit that holy work into their own self: therefore they touch their faces.


## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

#### E. CONCLUDING CEREMONIES.

<span id="v4_4_4_11"><sup><small>4:4:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Now, it is nine Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us [^872] he offers on this occasion. The reason why he offers nine Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us is that those stotra-verses at the Bahishpavamâna [^873] chant amount to nine. Thus there is at both ends an inferior (incomplete) virâ<i>g</i> [^874], for the <span id="p375">[<sup><small>p. 375</small></sup>]</span> sake of production: it was from that same inferior (lower) source of production on both sides that Pra<i>g</i>âpati produced the creatures,—from the one (he created) the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground. And in like manner does he (the Adhvaryu) now create creatures from that lower source of production on both sides,—from the one the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground.

<span id="v4_4_4_22"><sup><small>4:4:4:22.</small></sup></span>  The call ‘Hi<i>m</i>’ is the tenth of stotra-verses, and the ‘Svâhâ’ (the tenth) of these (Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us): and thus does this incomplete virâ<i>g</i> come to consist of tens and tens.

<span id="v4_4_4_33"><sup><small>4:4:4:33.</small></sup></span>  And as to why they are called Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us. Whatever deities he invites at this sacrifice, and for whatever deities this sacrifice is performed, they all are thereby ‘sacrificed-to together’ (sam-ish<i>t</i>a); and because, after all those (deities) have been ‘sacrificed-to together,’ he now offers those (libations), therefore they are called Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us.

<span id="v4_4_4_44"><sup><small>4:4:4:44.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he offers the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us. Now, the self of him who has sacrificed has, as it were, become emptied, since he gives away of whatever is his: it is him he fills again by three out of these (oblations).

<span id="v4_4_4_55"><sup><small>4:4:4:55.</small></sup></span>  And as to the three following which he offers,—whatever deities he invites at this sacrifice, and for whatever deities this sacrifice is performed, they continue waiting till the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us are performed, thinking, ‘These, forsooth, he must offer unto us!’ It is these same deities he thereby dismisses in due form whithersoever their course lies.

<span id="v4_4_4_66"><sup><small>4:4:4:66.</small></sup></span>  And as to the three last which he offers,—in performing the sacrifice he has produced it, and, <span id="p376">[<sup><small>p. 376</small></sup>]</span> having produced it, he firmly establishes it where there is a safe resting-place for it: this is why he performs the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us.

<span id="v4_4_4_77"><sup><small>4:4:4:77.</small></sup></span>  He offers (the first) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 15; Rig-veda V, 42, 4), ‘With thought lead us, O Indra, to meet with kine,’—‘with thought him who was emptied he thereby fills with thought; with kine;’ him who was emptied he thereby fills with kine;—‘with patrons, O mighty Lord, with well-being; with prayer which is divinely inspired [^875],’—‘with prayer:’ him who was emptied he thereby fills with prayer;—‘with the favour of the adorable gods! Hail!’

<span id="v4_4_4_88"><sup><small>4:4:4:88.</small></sup></span>  \[The second with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 16\], ‘With lustre, with sap, with bodies,’—‘with lustre him who was emptied he thereby fills with lustre; with sap,’—sap is vigour—him who was emptied he thus fills with sap;—‘We have united, with the happy spirit: may Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and may he smooth what was injured in our body!’ Thus they heal what was torn.

<span id="v4_4_4_99"><sup><small>4:4:4:99.</small></sup></span>  \[The third with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, I7; Atharva-veda VII, 17, 4\], ‘May the gracious Dhât<i>ri</i>, Savit<i>ri</i>, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the guardian of treasures, and the divine Agni accept this (offering); and Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> and Vish<i>n</i>u: grant ye willingly to the sacrificer wealth together with children! Hail!’ Him who was emptied he fills again, when he says, ‘grant ye wealth to the sacrificer, Hail!’ <span id="p377">[<sup><small>p. 377</small></sup>]</span> 4:4:4:1010\. \[^876]\], ‘Accessible homes have we prepared for you, O gods, who graciously came to this Soma feast;’—whereby he means to say, ‘seats easy of access we have prepared for you, O gods, who have graciously come to this Soma feast;’—‘Carrying and driving the offerings,’ thereby he dismisses the several deities; ‘Those forsooth who are without cars may go away carrying; and those who have cars may go away driving,’ this is what he means to say; therefore he says, ‘Carrying and driving the offerings;’—‘bestow goods on him, ye good! Hail!’

<span id="v4_4_4_1111"><sup><small>4:4:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  \[The fifth with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 19; Atharva-veda VII, 97, 3\], ‘The willing gods whom thou, O God, broughtest hither, speed them each to his own abode, O Agni!’ For to Agni he said, ‘Bring hither such and such gods! bring hither such and such gods!’ and to him he now says, ‘Whatever gods thou hast brought hither, make them go whithersoever their course lies!’—‘Ye have all eaten and drunk,’—for they have eaten the cakes of the animal offering, and they have drunk the king Soma: therefore he says, ‘ye have all eaten and drunk;’—‘Draw ye nigh to the air, to the heat, to the light! H ail!’ Hereby, then, he dismisses the deities.

<span id="v4_4_4_1212"><sup><small>4:4:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  \[The sixth with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 20\], ‘Thee, O Agni, have we chosen here for our Hot<i>ri</i> at the opening of this sacrifice: severally hast thou offered to them, and severally hast thou toiled; well-knowing the sacrifice, draw thou nigh [^877], thou the wise! Hail!’ by this (verse) he releases Agni, dismisses Agni. <span id="p378">[<sup><small>p. 378</small></sup>]</span> 4:4:4:1313\. \[The seventh with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 21\], ‘Ye path-finding gods,’—for the gods are, indeed, the finders of the path;—‘having found the path,’—‘having found the sacrifice,’ he thereby means to say;—‘go ye in the path!’ therewith he dismisses them in due form;—‘O divine Lord of mind, this sacrifice—Svâhâ!—give thou to the wind!’ for the sacrifice, indeed, is yonder blowing (wind): having thus completed this sacrifice, he establishes it in that sacrifice, and thus unites sacrifice with sacrifice,—hence he says, ‘Svâhâ! give (it) to the wind!’

<span id="v4_4_4_1414"><sup><small>4:4:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  \[The eighth with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 22\], ‘O sacrifice, go to the sacrifice, go to the lord of the sacrifice, go to thine own womb, Hail!’—the sacrifice, thus established, he thereby establishes in its own womb. \[The ninth he offers with\], ‘This is thy sacrifice, O lord of the sacrifice, bestowing numerous heroes, together with the song of praise: do thou accept it, Hail!’ the sacrifice, thus established, bestowing numerous heroes, together with the song of praise he thereby finally establishes in the sacrificer.


<span id="v4_4_5"><sup><small>4:4:5</small></sup></span>

## FIFTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v4_4_5_11"><sup><small>4:4:5:11.</small></sup></span>  He now betakes himself to the expiatory bath (avabh<i>ri</i>tha). The reason why he betakes himself to the expiatory bath is this. What vital sap there has been in him (Soma and the sacrificer), that (sap) of his he (the priest) has produced (extracted) for the offerings. Now that body (of Soma, i.e. <span id="p379">[<sup><small>p. 379</small></sup>]</span> the Soma-husks),—there is no sap in it; (yet) it is not to be cast away: they take it down to the water and—water being sap—he puts that sap into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and thus he produces him from it,—he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer) [^878]: and because they take it down (ava-h<i>ri</i> [^879]) to the water, therefore (the bath is called) avabh<i>ri</i>tha.

<span id="v4_4_5_22"><sup><small>4:4:5:22.</small></sup></span>  In the first place he performs the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us offerings, for the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us are the extreme end of the sacrifice. As soon as he has performed the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us, they go together to the <i>k</i>âtvâla (pit) with whatever he (the sacrificer) has about him [^880]: both the black-deer's horn [^881] and the girdle he throws into the pit,—

<span id="v4_4_5_33"><sup><small>4:4:5:33.</small></sup></span>  With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 23), ‘Be thou nor adder nor viper!’ Now when they take the Soma-husks down to the water, that forsooth is the wishing of ‘good-speed [^882]!’ to it, and this now is the ‘good-speed!’ to him (the sacrificer); for snakes are like rope, and snakes' haunts are like wells (pits), and there is as it were a feud between men and snakes: ‘Lest that should spring therefrom,’ he thinks, and therefore he says, ‘Be thou nor adder nor viper!’ <span id="p380">[<sup><small>p. 380</small></sup>]</span> 4:4:5:44\. He then makes (the sacrificer) say (Rig-veda I, 24, 8), ‘Broad forsooth is the path which king Varu<i>n</i>a hath made for the sun to walk along,’—whereby he means to say, ‘even as there is for the sun that broad path, free from danger and injury, so may there be for me here a broad path, free from danger and injury.’

<span id="v4_4_5_55"><sup><small>4:4:5:55.</small></sup></span>  ‘For the footless hath he made feet to put down [^883],’ for, although he (the sun) is footless, yet he is able to walk;—‘And the forbidder is he of all that woundeth the heart,’—thus he frees him from every guilt and evil of the heart.

<span id="v4_4_5_66"><sup><small>4:4:5:66.</small></sup></span>  He then says, ‘Sing the Sâman!’ or ‘Speak the Sâman!’ but let him rather say ‘Sing,’ for they do sing the Sâman. The reason why he sings the Sâman is that the evil spirits may not injure that body of his outside the sacrifice, for the Sâman is a repeller of the evil spirits.

<span id="v4_4_5_77"><sup><small>4:4:5:77.</small></sup></span>  He (the Prastot<i>ri</i>) sings a (verse) to Agni, for Agni is a repeller of the evil spirits. He sings in the Ati<i>kh</i>andas; for this, the Ati<i>kh</i>andas, is all the metres [^884]: therefore he sings in the Ati<i>kh</i>andas.

<span id="v4_4_5_88"><sup><small>4:4:5:88.</small></sup></span>  He sings, ‘Agni burneth, Agni encountereth with flames,—Ahâva<i>h</i>! Ahâva<i>h</i> [^885]!’ Thus he drives the evil spirits away from here. <span id="p381">[<sup><small>p. 381</small></sup>]</span> 4:4:5:99\. They walk out (from the sacrificial ground) northwards, along the back of the pit and the front side of the Âgnîdhra: then they proceed in whatever direction the water is.

<span id="v4_4_5_1010"><sup><small>4:4:5:1010.</small></sup></span>  Where there is a standing pool of flowing water, there let him (the sacrificer) descend into the water—for whatsoever parts of flowing water flow not, these are holden by Varu<i>n</i>a; and the expiatory bath belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a—to free himself from Varu<i>n</i>a. But if he does not find such, he may descend into any water.

<span id="v4_4_5_1111"><sup><small>4:4:5:1111.</small></sup></span>  While he makes him descend into the water, he bids him say, 'Homage be to Varu<i>n</i>a: downtrodden is Varu<i>n</i>a's snare!' thus he delivers him from every snare of Varu<i>n</i>a, from every (infliction [^886]) of Varu<i>n</i>a.

<span id="v4_4_5_1212"><sup><small>4:4:5:1212.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon, taking ghee in four ladlings, and throwing down a kindling-stick (on the water), he offers thereon, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 24), ‘The face of Agni, the waters, have I entered, escaping from the power of demons, O son of the waters! In every homestead offer thou the log, O Agni! let thy tongue dart forth towards the ghee,—Hail!’

<span id="v4_4_5_1313"><sup><small>4:4:5:1313.</small></sup></span>  Now, once on a time, the gods made so much of Agni, as would go in [^887], enter the water, in order that the evil spirits should not rise therefrom; for Agni is the repeller of evil spirits. It is him he kindles by this kindling-stick and by this <span id="p382">[<sup><small>p. 382</small></sup>]</span> oblation, thinking ‘On the kindled (fire) will I offer to the gods!’

<span id="v4_4_5_1414"><sup><small>4:4:5:1414.</small></sup></span>  Then, having taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, and having called for the (Âgnîdhra's) <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Pronounce the offering prayer to the Kindling-sticks!’ He offers four fore-offerings, omitting that to the Barhis [^888]\—the Barhis being offspring, and the expiatory bath belonging to Varu<i>n</i>a—lest Varu<i>n</i>a should seize upon his offspring. This is why he offers four fore-offerings, omitting that to the Barhis.

<span id="v4_4_5_1515"><sup><small>4:4:5:1515.</small></sup></span>  Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Varu<i>n</i>a. For whatever sap there had been in him (Soma), that sap of his he has produced (extracted) for the offerings. Now that body: there is no sap in it. But the cake is sap: that sap he puts into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and so produces him from it,—he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer): hence there is a cake on -one potsherd for Varu<i>n</i>a.

<span id="v4_4_5_1616"><sup><small>4:4:5:1616.</small></sup></span>  Having made an ‘underlayer’ of ghee (in the offering-spoon), he says, while making the cuttings from the cake [^889], ‘Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Varu<i>n</i>a!’ Here now some make two cuttings from the Soma-husks, but let him not do so; for that (heap of husks) is an empty body, unfit for offering. He makes two cuttings (from the cake) and bastes them once with ghee, and anoints (replenishes the places whence) the cuttings (have been made). Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Recite the <span id="p383">[<sup><small>p. 383</small></sup>]</span> offering prayer to Varu<i>n</i>a!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered.

<span id="v4_4_5_1717"><sup><small>4:4:5:1717.</small></sup></span>  Then, having made an underlayer of ghee, he says, while putting the (remainder of the) cake (into the spoon), ‘Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni and Varu<i>n</i>a!’ This is for (Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t [^890]; and as to why he does not say ‘To Agni,’ it is lest Varu<i>n</i>a might seize upon Agni. If before he has cut twice from the Soma-husks, he now does so once, but if (he did) not, he need not heed it. He then bastes it twice with butter on the upper side; and having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Recite the offering prayer to Agni and Varu<i>n</i>a!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered.

<span id="v4_4_5_1818"><sup><small>4:4:5:1818.</small></sup></span>  Now these are six oblations; for there are six seasons in the year, and Varu<i>n</i>a is the year: hence there are six oblations.

<span id="v4_4_5_1919"><sup><small>4:4:5:1919.</small></sup></span>  This is the course of the Âdityas [^891]; and these Ya<i>g</i>us, they say, belong to the Âdityas. Let (the Adhvaryu) endeavour to perform as much of it as is his (the sacrificer's) wish. And if the sacrificer tell him to do otherwise, then he should do otherwise. He may also perform those same four fore-offerings,—omitting that to the Barhis—two butter-portions, (the oblations of cake) to Varu<i>n</i>a and Agni-Varu<i>n</i>a, and two after-offerings,—omitting the one to the Barhis;—this makes ten. Now the virâ<i>g</i> consists <span id="p384">[<sup><small>p. 384</small></sup>]</span> of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is virâ<i>g</i>: thus he makes the sacrifice to be like the virâ<i>g</i>.

<span id="v4_4_5_2020"><sup><small>4:4:5:2020.</small></sup></span>  This is the course of the Aṅgiras. Having performed the offerings either way, (the Adhvaryu) makes the pot, in which the husks are, float with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 25), ‘In the ocean, in the waters, is thy heart (O Soma)’—for the ocean is the waters, and water is sap: that sap he now puts into him (Soma), and thus he unites him with that sap, and produces him therefrom; and he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer);—‘May the plants and the waters unite with thee!’—thereby he puts two kinds of sap into him, that which is in plants, and that which is in water,—‘that we may serve thee, O lord of the sacrifice, in the singing of praises and the utterance of worship [^892], with Svâhâ!’ Whatever is good in the sacrifice, that he thereby puts into him.

<span id="v4_4_5_2121"><sup><small>4:4:5:2121.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon, letting it go, he stands by it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 26), ‘Ye divine waters, this is your child,’—for he (Soma) indeed is the child of the waters,—‘bear ye him, well-beloved, well-nourished!’ he thereby makes him over to the waters for protection—‘This, O divine Soma, is thine abode: thrive thou well therein, and thrive thou [^893] thoroughly!’ whereby he means to say, ‘Be thou therein for our happiness, and shield us from all inflictions!’ <span id="p385">[<sup><small>p. 385</small></sup>]</span> 4:4:5:2222\. He then immerses it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 27), ‘O laving bath, laving thou glidest along: with the help of the gods may I wipe out the sin committed against the gods; and with the help of the mortals that committed against mortals!’—for the sin committed against the gods he has indeed wiped out with the help of the gods, namely, with the help of king Soma; and the sin committed against mortals he has wiped out with the help of mortals, namely, by means of the animal victim and the sacrificial cake—‘Preserve me, O god, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!’ whereby he means to say, ‘Preserve me from all inflictions!’

<span id="v4_4_5_2323"><sup><small>4:4:5:2323.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon both (the sacrificer and his wife) having descended, bathe, and wash each other's back. Having wrapped themselves in fresh garments [^894] they step out: even as a snake casts its skin, so does he cast away all his sin,—there is not in him even as much sin as there is in a toothless child. By the same way by which they came out (from the sacrificial ground), they return thither [^895]; and, having returned, he puts a kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya (at the front hall-door) with, ‘Thou art the kindler of the gods!’ He thereby kindles the sacrificer himself, <span id="p386">[<sup><small>p. 386</small></sup>]</span> for along with the kindling of the gods the sacrificer is kindled [^896].

  Sûkta to Heaven and Earth, I, 159, with the Nivid ‘May Heaven and Earth delight in the Soma!’ &c., inserted before the last verse; the Adhvaryu's response being thrice Madâmo daiva,' see [p. 330](Book_2_4_3#p330), note [3](Book_2_4_3#fn782).
  Dhâyyâ verse, I, 4, 1.

  Ukthavîrya, ‘Praise has been sung to Indra, to the gods, to hear thee!’
  Then follows the recitation of the offering prayer VI, 52, 13, after which the libation is made, the remaining juice being then drunk, as well as that in the <i>k</i>amasas.

[^845]: 361:2 That is, having been rinsed in the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya, the three dvidevatya are deposited on the khara by the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>.

[^846]: 362:1 See [IV, 1, 3](Book_2_4_1#v4_1_3).

[^847]: 362:2 Perhaps we ought to read, with the Kâ<i>n</i>va text, gâyatra<i>m</i> vai prâta<i>h</i>savana<i>m</i> gâyatra<i>m</i> agne<i>s</i> <i>kh</i>ando brahma vâ agnir, brâhma<i>n</i>eshu haiva pa<i>s</i>avo ’bhavishyan, ‘the morning pressing relating to the gâyatrî, and the gâyatrî metre belonging to Agni, and Agni being the priesthood.’

[^848]: 363:1 Probably, because Soma is slain in being sacrificed (see [IV, 3, 4, 1](Book_2_4_3#v4_3_4_1)), and therefore belongs to the Fathers or Departed Spirits.

[^849]: 363:2 And the All-gods (or all he gods) mean everything. See [IV, 4, 1, 4](Book_2_4_4#v4_4_1_4).

[^850]: 364:1 The homa of ghee, made-before the rice-pap oblation to Soma, belongs to Agni, and the one made after the oblation, to Vish<i>n</i>u. If only one homa be made, it belongs to Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, ‘Tad vâ âhur anyatarata eva pariya<i>g</i>et purastâd eveti,’ now they say, ‘He should offer on one side only, and that in front (previously to the <i>k</i>aru).’ For the offering formulas, see Â<i>s</i>v. V, 19, 3; Ait. Br. III, 32. After the completion of these offerings, the Adhvaryu pours ordinary ghee on the rice-pap and presents it to the Hot<i>ri</i>, who looks at it while pronouncing some formulas (Â<i>s</i>v. V, 19, 4, 5), and he smears his eyes with the ghee on the pap, after which the latter is handed to the chanters (udgât<i>ri</i>) to be eaten by them.

[^851]: 364:2 See [III, 6, 2, 19](Book_2_3_6#v3_6_2_19).

[^852]: 365:1 Viz., Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 31, 32. The Âgnîdhra hearth is prepared first, and the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya last of the eight dhish<i>n</i>yas. See [p. 148](Book_2_3_6#p148), note [4](Book_2_3_6#fn392).

[^853]: 365:2 Or, uppermost (uttamam; the Kâ<i>n</i>vas read ‘antamâm’).

[^854]: 365:3 The meaning of the term pâtnîvata is ‘relating to the patnîvant (i.e. wived or mated one),’ the ‘patnîvant’ being probably Soma with the water mixed with it; or Agni with the wives of the gods, (with special reference to the sacrificer's wife); cf. Taitt. S. VI, 5, 8, I, 2. According to the Kâ<i>n</i>va text, Agni associated with the goddess Speech (Vâ<i>k</i> patnî) seems to be understood.

[^855]: 366:1 See [p. 268](Book_2_4_1#p268), note [1](Book_2_4_1#fn643).

[^856]: 366:2 In the St. Petersburg Dictionary ‘patnîvata<i>h</i>’ seems to be taken as qualifying ‘grahân;’ but cp. Rig-veda VIII, 82, 22, ‘United with their wives (i.e. the water mixed with the Soma-juice?) these Soma-draughts (sutâ<i>h</i>) go longing to the rejoicing.’

[^857]: 367:1 ‘î<i>s</i>,’ etymologically connected with ‘own.’

[^858]: 367:2 Or, wived, mated one, ‘patnîvan;’ the Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads ‘Agne Vâ<i>k</i> patni.’ See preceding page, note [^853].

[^859]: 368:1 But if it be an Ukthya, or Shoda<i>s</i>in, or Atirâtra, or Vâ<i>g</i>apeya, Kâ<i>n</i>va text. See towards the end of next note.

[^860]: 368:2 Kâty. X, 7 and schol. supply the following details. The Unnet<i>ri</i> puts down the <i>k</i>amasa cups behind the high altar, and pours into them the entire Soma-juice remaining in the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t, putting but little into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup, to leave room in it for the dhruva libation. Besides this the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is the only Soma that remains. The Adhvaryu then, by touching the Soma in the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup with two stalks of grass, gives the signal for the chanting of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma Sâman (viz. the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya, Sâmav. II, 53, 54), wrapping up his head, if he chooses, in the same way as the Udgât<i>ri</i>s. Meanwhile the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> leads up the lady through the back door into the Sadas, makes her sit down north of the Udgât<i>ri</i> and exchange looks with the latter three times (at the ‘Hi<i>m</i>,’ see [p. 308](Book_2_4_2#p308), note [2](Book_2_4_2#fn745)). Three times also (at every Nidhana) she uncovers her right leg and pours on it some of the pânne<i>g</i>anî water fetched by her in the morning (see [III, 9, 3, 27](Book_2_3_9#v3_9_3_27)), p. 369 whereupon she returns to her own tent. Then follows the recitation of the Âgnimâruta <i>s</i>astra, consisting of the following parts:—
  Sûkta (hymn), Rig-veda III, 3, to Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, with Nivid (‘May Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara feast on this Soma,’ &c.) inserted before the last verse.
  Dhâyyâ, I, 43, 6; or (verse to Rudra) II, 33, 1.
  Sûkta, I, 87, to Maruts, with Nivid (‘May the Maruts feast on this Soma,’ &c.) before the last verse.
  Stotriya pragâtha, VI, 48, 1-2 (identical with the text of the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya Sâman).
  Anurûpa pragâtha, VII, 16, II-12 (antistrophe).
  Sûkta to Agni <i>G</i>âtavedas, I, 143, with Nivid before the last verse.
  Tristich to Âpa<i>h</i> (waters), X, 9, 1-3, recited in breaks, the Hot<i>ri</i> having previously uncovered his head (as do the other priests) and touched water, and the others holding on to him from behind. This and the following parts also have the Âhâva (‘<i>s</i>o<i>m</i>sâvom’) before each of them.
  Verse VI, 50, 14 to Agni Budhnya.
  Verses V, 46, 7-8 to wives of gods.
  Verses II, 32, 4-5 to Râkâ.
  Verse VI, 49, 7 to Pâviravî (daughter of lightning).
  Verse X, 14, 4 to Yama.
  Verse X, 14, 3 to Kavyas (manes).
  Verses X, 15, 1, 3, 2 to Pitara<i>h</i> (fathers), with the Âhâva before each verse.
  Anupânîya (or Svâdushkilîya) verses VI, 47, I-4 to Indra. After each of the first three the Adhvaryu may respond to the Hot<i>ri</i>'s Âhâva, with ‘madâmo daiva’ (instead of ‘<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sâmo daiva’). See note on [IV, 3, 2, 11](Book_2_4_3#v4_3_2_11).
  Verse to Vish<i>n</i>u and Varu<i>n</i>a (Atharva-veda VII, 25, 1). p. 370
  Verse to Vish<i>n</i>u, Rig-veda I, 154, 1.
  Verse to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, X, 53, 6.
  Paridhânîyâ (concluding verse) IV, 17, 20, in reciting which the Hot<i>ri</i> touches the ground; and during the recitation of the last pâda the Dhruva graha is poured into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup.
  Ukthavîrya, ‘Praise has been sung to Indra, to the gods, for hearing (?) thee!’
  Yâ<i>g</i>yâ (offering prayer) V, 60, 8, at the conclusion of which libations are made to Agni and the Maruts, both at the Vasha<i>t</i> and Anuvasha<i>t</i>.
  Then follow the after-offerings of the animal sacrifice (see [III, 8, 4, 1](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_4_1) seq.).
  At the Ukthya (and other Soma-sacrifices) the Ukthya graha is drawn immediately after the drawing of the Âgraya<i>n</i>a (see [IV, 3, 5, 24](Book_2_4_3#v4_3_5_24), with note). Previous to the after-offerings the Ukthya graha is divided, as at the morning and midday performances (see [p. 293](Book_2_4_2#p293), note [2](Book_2_4_2#fn706)), between the three Hotrakas, with a view to the recitation of their <i>s</i>astras which form the distinctive feature of the Ukthya sacrifice, bringing up the number of <i>s</i>astras (and stotras) from twelve (of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma) to fifteen. Besides, the Ukthya requires the immolation of at least two victims on the Soma-day, viz. a he-goat to Indra and Agni, besides the one to Agni.

[^861]: 370:1 See I, 8, 2, 8; the translation has been amended in accordance with Professor Whitney's suggestions, American Journal of Philology, III, p. 406.

[^862]: 370:2 That is, referring to the ‘hari-yo<i>g</i>ana,’ or (Indra's) team of bay steeds.

[^863]: 371:1 For the <i>S</i>am-yos, see part i, p. 254, note. The pronunciation of that formula takes place after the offering proper is completed.

[^864]: 371:2 ? Or burst (udvavarta), as the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads.—V<i>ri</i>tro vai soma âsît ta<i>m</i> yatra devâ<i>h</i> pâtreshu vyag_ri<i>h</i>n_ata tasya mûrdhno (!) vyavartta sa dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>o ’bhavat.

[^865]: 371:3 Yâvân vâ yâvân vâ rasa<i>h</i>, (? some indeterminate quantity of the juice:) Cf. [IV, 4, 5, 13](Book_2_4_4#v4_4_5_13).

[^866]: 372:1 The text might also be taken in the sense of ‘Whatever metre there is, both measured and unmeasured, all that he thereby consumes.’ The libation is, however, taken out for the metres or cattle, represented by the grain.

[^867]: 372:2 Instead of the Âgnîdhra, see I, 5, 2, 16, with note.

[^868]: 372:3 Regarding ‘prasthitam,’ see [p. 198](Book_2_3_8#p198), note [3](Book_2_3_8#fn495).

[^869]: 373:1 They are only to smell the grains steeped in the Soma-juice.

[^870]: 373:2 The Kâ<i>n</i>va recension adds, ‘O divine Soma!’

[^871]: 373:3 Lit., having Ya<i>g</i>us offered, and chants chanted for it.

[^872]: 373:4 ? I.e. ‘that to which I am invited.’

[^873]: 373:5 That is, the ten <i>K</i>amasins touch their respective <i>k</i>amasa cups, filled with water and placed in the proper order from south to north, behind the pit (kâtvâla), after putting fresh ku<i>s</i>a stalks on them. Those priests who have no cups of their own touch the cups of those with whom they are most nearly connected, viz. the four Adhvaryus that of the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> the Udgât<i>ri</i>'s assistants that of their principal, the Grâvastut that of the Hot<i>ri</i>. Thereupon they touch their faces and betake themselves to the Âgnîdhra fire-house, to partake of sour milk. Then follow, on the Gârhapatya (at the front hall door), the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as of the cakes of the animal offering, followed by the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us, See also Lâ<i>t</i>y. <i>S</i>r. II, 11, 16 seq.

[^874]: 374:1 See I, 9, 3, 6. Cf. Atharva-veda VI, 53, 3. The Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya Br. I, 3, 9 reads ‘sa<i>m</i> tapobhi<i>h</i>’ (with fervour).

[^875]: 374:2 See I, 9, 2, 25 seq.

[^876]: 374:3 See [p. 310](Book_2_4_2#p310), note [1](Book_2_4_2#fn747).

[^877]: 374:4 The virâ<i>g</i> consists of pâdas of ten syllables. For the same speculation, see II, 5, I, 20.

[^878]: 376:1 ? The author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a would rather seem to take it in the sense of ‘with the priestly authority (sacerdotium) instituted by the gods.’

[^879]: 377:1 Cf. Atharva-veda VII, 97, 4.

[^880]: 377:2 That is, according to Mahîdhara, ‘knowing that the sacrifice p. 378 is accomplished, go thou to thine own house!’ Cf. Atharva-veda VII, 97, 1 (‘draw near to Soma!’).

[^881]: 379:1 ? That is, as the Soma plants become juicy again, so the sacrificer has his vital sap or spirit restored.

[^882]: 379:2 Or, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, ‘they throw it into the water.’

[^883]: 379:3 Or, whatever is connected with Soma (?). According to Kâty. X, 8, 12, 19 the throne (âsandî) and Audumbarî, as well as the Soma vessels, Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a, &c., are to be carried in the first place to the <i>k</i>âtvâla, and from there to the water.

[^884]: 379:4 See [III, 2, 1, 18](Book_2_3_2#v3_2_1_18). The Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> is silently to throw after the lady's zone and peg (for scratching herself).

[^885]: 379:5 For the ‘svagâkâra,’ see I, 8, 3, 11.

[^886]: 380:1 Or, ‘To the footless he has given to put down his feet:’ in either sense it seems to be taken by the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a (and the St. Petersburg Dictionary). Perhaps, however, ‘apade’ had better be taken, with Mahîdhara (and Sâya<i>n</i>a?), in the sense of ‘padarahite,’ i.e. ‘in the trackless (ether) he caused him (the sun) to plant his feet.’ Similarly Ludwig, ‘Im Ortlosen hat er sie die Füsse niedersetzen lassen.’

[^887]: 380:2 ‘Eshâ vai sarvam ati yad ati<i>kh</i>anda<i>h</i>,’ Kâ<i>n</i>va text. Ati<i>kh</i>andas, i.e. over-metre, redundant metre, is the generic term for metres consisting of more than forty-eight syllables.

[^888]: 380:3 All the priests, as well as the sacrificer, are to join in the p. 381 nidhana (finale, or concluding word of the Sâman). According to Kâty. X, 8, 16, 17 the Sâman is chanted thrice, viz. in starting from the <i>k</i>âtvâla, midway, and at the water-side.

[^889]: 381:1 Or guilt against Varu<i>n</i>a. See [p. 221](Book_2_3_9#p221), note [1](Book_2_3_9#fn552).

[^890]: 381:2 Agner yâvad vâ yâvad vâ. Cf. [p. 371](Book_2_4_4#p371), note [3](Book_2_4_4#fn862).

[^891]: 382:1 For the usual five prayâ<i>g</i>as, see I, 5, 3, 8-13.

[^892]: 382:2 As a rule, cakes on one potsherd are to be offered entire. The present cake, however, is to be an exception, and the usual two portions are to be cut from it. See part i, p. 192, note.

[^893]: 383:1 See I, 7, 3, 7 seq.

[^894]: 383:2 Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 393, refers us to XIV, 9, 4, 33, where it is stated that the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyin Adhvaryu has to study the Ya<i>g</i>us of the Âditya <i>Ri</i>shi. One might also be inclined to think that, by ‘Adityânâm ayanam’ and ‘Aṅgirasâm ayanam’ the author intended to connect the Agnish<i>t</i>oma with the sacrificial sessions designated by those terms, for which see Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. XII, 1-2; Ait. Br. IV, 17, with Haug's notes.

[^895]: 384:1 See part i, p. 249, note 1.

[^896]: 384:2 ‘Vakshva’ is by Mahîdhara (and apparently by the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a) referred to ‘vah;’ by the St. Petersburg Dictionary to ‘vas’ for ‘vatsva.’ I have referred it to ‘vaksh.’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads, Pari <i>k</i>a vakshi <i>s</i>a<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a vakshîti pari <i>k</i>a no gopâya <i>s</i>a<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a na edhîty evaitad âha.

[^897]: 385:1 According to the Mânava Sûtra, as quoted on Kâty. X, 9, 6, the sacrificer wraps himself in the cloth in which the Soma stalks were tied (somopanahana), and his wife in the outer cloth tied round the Soma bundle (paryâ<i>n</i>ahana). The Soma vessels and implements are likewise thrown into the water.

[^898]: 385:2 While going thither they all mutter the Âmahîyâ verse, Rig-veda VIII, 48, 3, ‘We have drunk Soma, we have become immortal, we have gone to the light, we have attained to the gods: what now can the enemy do unto us, what the guile, O immortal, of the mortal?’

[^899]: 386:1 The sacrificer sits down behind the <i>s</i>âlâdvârya fire and spreads the black deer-skin over his knees; the Adhvaryu then making an oblation of ghee from the dipping-spoon.
