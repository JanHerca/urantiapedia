### THE ALTAR OF NIR<i>RI</i>TI.

## SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v7_2_1_11"><sup><small>7:2:1:11.</small></sup></span>  They now take the Nir<i>ri</i>ti (bricks) from there. For, having built the Gârhapatya, the gods then ascended it,—the Gârhapatya being this (earth-) world, it is this world they ascended after completing it. They saw nothing but darkness not to be seen through.

<span id="v7_2_1_22"><sup><small>7:2:1:22.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Think ye upon this, how we may dispel that darkness, evil!’ They said, ‘Meditate ye (<i>k</i>etay)!’—whereby indeed they said, ‘Seek ye to build an altar (kitim)!’—‘Seek ye so that we may dispel that darkness, evil!’

<span id="v7_2_1_33"><sup><small>7:2:1:33.</small></sup></span>  Whilst meditating, they saw those Nir<i>ri</i>ti bricks; they piled them up, and by them dispelled that darkness, evil; for Nir<i>ri</i>ti (corruption, or destruction) is evil; and inasmuch as by them they dispelled Nir<i>ri</i>ti, evil, these are Nir<i>ri</i>ti's (bricks).

<span id="v7_2_1_44"><sup><small>7:2:1:44.</small></sup></span>  Now that same thing which the gods did, is done here: even now that darkness, that evil, has indeed been dispelled by the gods themselves; but when he now does this, it is because he thinks, ‘I must do what the gods did.’ And, besides, he removes, by means of these (bricks), whatever evil, whatever corruption there is; and because he removes by them evil, corruption (nir<i>ri</i>ti), therefore these are Nir<i>ri</i>ti's (bricks).

<span id="v7_2_1_55"><sup><small>7:2:1:55.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why they take these (bricks) of Nir<i>ri</i>ti;—when the gods restored the relaxed Pra<i>g</i>âpati, they cast him as seed into the fire-pan, the <span id="p320"><sup><small>[ p. 320 ]</small></sup></span> womb; the fire-pan being indeed a womb. In the course of a year they prepared for him this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world; the Gârhapatya (hearth) being this world: therein they generated him. And whatever evil there was in him, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer membrane, that they removed from him by means of these (bricks); and inasmuch as thereby they removed his evil, his corruption, these are Nir<i>ri</i>ti's (bricks).

<span id="v7_2_1_66"><sup><small>7:2:1:66.</small></sup></span>  In like manner the Sacrificer now casts his own self [^608], as seed, into the fire-pan, the womb; the fire-pan being indeed a womb. In the course of a year he prepares for that (self of his) this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world; the Gârhapatya being this world: therein he generates it. And whatever evil there is of it, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer membrane, that he removes therefrom by these (bricks); and inasmuch as he thereby removes its evil, its corruption, these are Nir<i>ri</i>ti's (bricks).

<span id="v7_2_1_77"><sup><small>7:2:1:77.</small></sup></span>  They measure a foot (square): he thus treads evil, corruption, under foot. They are unmarked; for whatever is not, that is unmarked (by characteristics): he thus makes evil, corruption to be non-existent. They get baked by (rice) husks, for husks belong to Nir<i>ri</i>ti: by Nir<i>ri</i>ti's own (objects) he thus performs Nir<i>ri</i>ti's rite. They are black, for black was that darkness; and black in truth is Nir<i>ri</i>ti (corruption).

<span id="v7_2_1_88"><sup><small>7:2:1:88.</small></sup></span>  With them they proceed towards that (southwestern) quarter, for that is Nir<i>ri</i>ti's quarter: he thus places Nir<i>ri</i>ti (corruption) in Nir<i>ri</i>ti's quarter. <span id="p321"><sup><small>[ p. 321 ]</small></sup></span> And anywhere where there is a self-produced hollow [^609] or cleft in the ground, he lays down those (bricks); for on whatever part of this (earth) there is a cleaving, or in whatever part of it plants are not produced, verily that part of it Nir<i>ri</i>ti seizes upon: he thus places corruption in a (part) of the earth set aside for Nir<i>ri</i>ti. Having put them in their places in a direction away from himself [^610], he lays them down [^611].

<span id="v7_2_1_99"><sup><small>7:2:1:99.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays them down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 62-64\] ‘Seek thou him that offereth not Soma, nor other offering!’ him who neither presses Soma nor makes offering Nir<i>ri</i>ti indeed visits;—‘Of the thief do thou follow the way, of the robber!’ that is, ‘follow the way both of the thief and the robber, and even as a thief or a robber remains concealed, so do thou remain concealed!’—‘Seek thou some one other than us: this is thy way;’ that is, ‘seek him who is ignorant of this (sacred work);’—‘Homage be to thee, O divine Nir<i>ri</i>ti!’ he thus turns Nir<i>ri</i>ti aside by rendering homage to her.

<span id="v7_2_1_1010"><sup><small>7:2:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  ‘Homage be unto thee full well, O sharp-edged Nir<i>ri</i>ti!’ for Nir<i>ri</i>ti is indeed sharp-edged: to her he thereby renders homage;—‘loose thou <span id="p322"><sup><small>[ p. 322 ]</small></sup></span> this iron bond!’ for it is indeed with an iron bond that Nir<i>ri</i>ti binds him whom she binds;—‘being of one mind with Yama and Yamî,’—Yama doubtless is Agni, and Yam is this (earth), and by these two everything here is kept in check: thus, ‘being of one mind with those two,’—‘raise him unto the highest firmament!’ the firmament is the heavenly world: thus, ‘raise the Sacrificer up to the heavenly world!’

<span id="v7_2_1_1111"><sup><small>7:2:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  ‘Thee, O awful (goddess), into whose mouth I offer—’ Nir<i>ri</i>ti is indeed awful, and into her mouth he now offers when he performs this divine rite;—‘for the unloosing of these bonds;’ that is, of those bonds with which he has been bound;—‘Thee whom people rejoice in calling Earth,’—the Earth is this (world), and he who exists, exists thereon,—‘but I know thee to be Nir<i>ri</i>ti everywhere!’ that is, in every respect I know that thou art Nir<i>ri</i>ti. Now Nir<i>ri</i>ti is this earth, and this earth makes him decay who becomes corrupted: in speaking thus, it is as if he were to say, ‘Thou art So and So, the son of So and So, I know thee, do not injure me!’ for in no wise does he who is known injure one when spoken to.

<span id="v7_2_1_1212"><sup><small>7:2:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  He does not touch (the bricks),—Nir<i>ri</i>ti being evil,—lest he put himself in contact with evil. He does not ‘settle’ them,—settlement being a firm footing—lest he give a firm footing to evil. He does not pronounce the Sûdadohas verse upon them,—the Sûdadohas being the vital air,—lest he should join Nir<i>ri</i>ti (corruption) together, and restore her.

<span id="v7_2_1_1313"><sup><small>7:2:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  Now some lay (the bricks) down from the farther end towards themselves,—Nir<i>ri</i>ti (corruption) being evil,—lest they themselves should go the way <span id="p323"><sup><small>[ p. 323 ]</small></sup></span> to corruption. Let him not do so, but let him lay them down in the direction away from him: he thus drives evil, corruption, away from him.

<span id="v7_2_1_1414"><sup><small>7:2:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  Three bricks he lays down,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus repels evil, corruption.

<span id="v7_2_1_1515"><sup><small>7:2:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  The seat, the netting, the sling of the gold plate, and the two pads he throws down on the farther side (of the bricks),—the sling [^612] is sacred to Nir<i>ri</i>ti: from Nir<i>ri</i>ti's sling he is thus freed. \[He throws them down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 65\] ‘The indissoluble bond which the divine Nir<i>ri</i>ti hath fastened upon thy neck,’—indissoluble indeed for him who does not know this;—‘that (bond) of thine I unloose, as from the middle of Âyus,’—Âyus [^613] doubtless is Agni, and his middle (body) is that Gârhapatya which has been built;—not yet built is the Âhavanîya: hence whether a youth builds the altar, or an old man, he says ‘as from the middle of Âyus;’—‘now, being urged forward, eat thou this nourishment!’ nourishment means food: thus, ‘now, set free, eat thou this food.’ With Trish<i>t</i>ubh verses (he performs this rite), for the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is a thunderbolt: it is thus with a thunderbolt that he repels evil, corruption.

<span id="v7_2_1_1616"><sup><small>7:2:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  There are three bricks, the seat, the netting, the sling of the gold plate, and the two pads; that makes eight;—the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, <span id="p324"><sup><small>[ p. 324 ]</small></sup></span> and Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus repels evil, corruption.

<span id="v7_2_1_1717"><sup><small>7:2:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  On the space between (the Sacrificer and the bricks) he pours out a jarful of water,—water is a thunderbolt: with a thunderbolt he thus separates from himself evil, corruption. With ‘Homage to (the goddess of) Prosperity who hath done this!’ they rise, for it was with a view to prosperity that the gods at first performed this rite, and to that (goddess) they then rendered homage; and for prosperity indeed this (Sacrificer) now performs this rite, and to that (goddess) he now renders homage. They go back (to the sacrificial ground) without looking back: they thus abandon evil, corruption, even without looking back to it.

<span id="v7_2_1_1818"><sup><small>7:2:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  Having returned, he stands worshipping by the fire; for when he goes into that (south-western) direction whilst Agni is only half built up, he does what is improper: he now makes amends to him to prevent his doing any harm.

<span id="v7_2_1_1919"><sup><small>7:2:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  And again, why he stands by (the fire). The Gârhapatya (hearth) is this (terrestrial) world; for the Gârhapatya is a foundation, and the foundation doubtless is this (earth). Now when he goes into that direction, he goes where there is no path; and when he stands by (the fire), he thereby returns to this (earth), the foundation, and establishes himself upon this foundation.

<span id="v7_2_1_2020"><sup><small>7:2:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  \[He worships, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 66\] ‘The harbourer and gatherer of riches,’ for a harbourer this world indeed is, a gatherer of riches;—‘all form he watches over with his favours,’—that is, ‘all forms (of being) he watches over with <span id="p325"><sup><small>[ p. 325 ]</small></sup></span> his favours;’—‘like the god Savit<i>ri</i>, like Indra, he of true covenant stood at the meeting of ways [^614];’ as the text, so its meaning.


<span id="v7_2_2"><sup><small>7:2:2</small></sup></span>

### PREPARATION OF THE SITE OF THE GREAT (ÂHAVANÎYA) ALTAR.

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v7_2_2_11"><sup><small>7:2:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He then prepares the Prâya<i>n</i>îya [^615] (opening sacrifice). With the Havishk<i>ri</i>t of that (oblation) he releases (the Sacrificer's) speech [^616]. Having released his speech, he throws away the grass-bush (stambaya<i>g</i>us [^617]). Having thrown away the grass-bush, and drawn the first line of enclosure [^618], and the lines (across the mahâ-vedi), he says, ‘Throw thrice!’ and the Âgnîdhra throws thrice (the wooden sword) [^619].

<span id="v7_2_2_22"><sup><small>7:2:2:22.</small></sup></span>  Having returned (to the offering, or hall-door <span id="p326"><sup><small>[ p. 326 ]</small></sup></span> fire) he proceeds with the opening sacrifice. Having performed the opening sacrifice, he yokes a plough. For the gods at that time, being about to heal him (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati), first supplied him with food, and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now that he is about to heal him, first supply him with food. It (the food) is the plough (sîra), for ‘sîra’ is the same as ‘sera [^620]:’ he thus puts food into him.

<span id="v7_2_2_33"><sup><small>7:2:2:33.</small></sup></span>  It is made of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood,—the Udumbara tree being sustenance, life-sap: he thus supplies him with sustenance, with life-sap. The cordage of the plough consists of mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass, triply twisted: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_2_2_44"><sup><small>7:2:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Standing behind the right (southern) hip of Agni (the site of the fire-altar) he (the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>) addresses it (the plough) while being yoked (by the Adhvaryu) in front of the left (northern) shoulder, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 67, 68; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 101, 4, 3), ‘The skilful yoke [^621] the ploughs, and stretch across the yokes,’—the skilful are those who know, and they do yoke the plough and stretch the yokes across;—‘the wise, with mind devoted to the gods,’—devotion means sacrifice: thus, ‘the wise, performing sacrifice to the gods.’

<span id="v7_2_2_55"><sup><small>7:2:2:55.</small></sup></span>  ‘Yoke ye the ploughs, and stretch across the yokes!’—they indeed yoke the plough, and stretch the yokes across;—‘into the ready womb here cast ye the seed!’ it is for the seed that that womb, the furrow, is made; and if one casts <span id="p327"><sup><small>[ p. 327 ]</small></sup></span> (seed) into unploughed (ground), it is just as if one were to shed seed elsewhere than into the womb. ‘And plentiful yield [^622] be there through our song!’—the song is speech, and yield means food;—‘and let the ripe crop go anigh the sickle!’ for when food gets ripe, people approach it with the sickle. With two (verses) he yokes, a Gâyatrî and a Trish<i>t</i>ubh one: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_2_2_66"><sup><small>7:2:2:66.</small></sup></span>  He yokes the right (ox) first, then the left one: thus it is (done) with the gods, differently in human (practice). It is a team of six oxen, or one of twelve oxen, or one of twenty-four oxen: it is the year (he obtains) as the consummation.

<span id="v7_2_2_77"><sup><small>7:2:2:77.</small></sup></span>  He then ploughs through it,—ploughing means food; and the gods at that time when they were about to heal him (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati) first put food into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now when he is about to heal him, first put food into him.

<span id="v7_2_2_88"><sup><small>7:2:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Only the body (of the altar-site) he ploughs through, not the wings and tail: he thus puts food into the body. And, indeed, the food which is put into the body benefits the body as well as the wings and tail; but that which (is put) into the wings and tail does not benefit either the body or the wings and tail.

<span id="v7_2_2_99"><sup><small>7:2:2:99.</small></sup></span>  On the right (south) side of the fire-altar, he ploughs first a furrow eastwards [^623] inside the enclosing-stones, with (Vâr. S. XII, 69; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 57, 8), ‘Right luckily may the plough-shares plough up the ground, luckily the tillers ply with their <span id="p328"><sup><small>[ p. 328 ]</small></sup></span> oxen!’—‘luckily—luckily,’ he says, ‘for what is successful that is lucky:’ he thus makes it (the furrow) successful.

<span id="v7_2_2_1010"><sup><small>7:2:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  Then on the hindpart (he ploughs a furrow) northwards [^624], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 70), ‘With sweet ghee let the furrow be saturated,’—as the text so its meaning;—‘approved of by the All-gods, by the Maruts!’ for both the All-gods and the Maruts have power over the rain;—‘sapful, and teeming with milk,’—milk means life-sap: thus, ‘teeming with life-sap and food;’—‘with milk, O furrow, turn thou unto us!’ that is, ‘with life-sap, O furrow, turn thou unto us!’

<span id="v7_2_2_1111"><sup><small>7:2:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  Then on the left (north) side (he ploughs a furrow) eastwards [^625], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 71), ‘The share-shod [^626] plough,’—that is, ‘the plough abounding in wealth,’—‘propitious, offering prospect for the Soma-cup [^627]’—for Soma is food;—‘it throweth up the cow, the sheep, the lusty wife, the swift-wheeled <span id="p329"><sup><small>[ p. 329 ]</small></sup></span> waggon,’ for all this the furrow throws up (yields).

<span id="v7_2_2_1212"><sup><small>7:2:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  Then on the forepart he ploughs a furrow) southwards [^628], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 72), ‘Milk out, O cow of plenty, their desire to Mitra, and to Varu<i>n</i>a, to Indra, to the A<i>s</i>vins, to Pûshan, to creatures and plants!’ husbandry is (beneficial) to all deities: thus, ‘Milk out for these deities all their desires!’—He first ploughs thus (south-west to southeast), then thus (south-west to north-west), then thus (north-west to north-east), then thus (north-east to south-east): that is (sunwise), for thus it is with the gods [^629].

<span id="v7_2_2_1313"><sup><small>7:2:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  Four furrows he ploughs with prayer: he thereby puts into him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati-Agni) what food there is in the four quarters; and that with prayer,—true is the prayer, and true (manifest) are those quarters. <span id="p330"><sup><small>[ p. 330 ]</small></sup></span> 7:2:2:1414\. He then ploughs (again) through the body: he thereby puts into him what food there is in the year. Silently (he does so), for what is silent is undetermined, and the undetermined is everything: by means of everything he thus puts food into him. He first ploughs thus (through the middle from south to north), then thus (south-west to north-east), then thus (east to west), then thus (north-west to south-east),—that is sunwise [^630], for thus it is with the gods.

<span id="v7_2_2_1515"><sup><small>7:2:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  Three furrows he ploughs each time,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food into him.

<span id="v7_2_2_1616"><sup><small>7:2:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  Twelve furrows he ploughs silently,—the year (consists of) twelve months, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts food into him.

<span id="v7_2_2_1717"><sup><small>7:2:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  Both kinds (of furrows) amount to sixteen,—of sixteen parts Pra<i>g</i>âpati consists, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Agni: he thus puts into him food proportionate to his body. And, indeed, the food which is proportionate to the body, satisfies, and does no harm; but that which is too much, does harm, and that which is too little, does not satisfy. <span id="p331"><sup><small>[ p. 331 ]</small></sup></span> 7:2:2:1818\. And, again, why he ploughs through him,—the gods being about to put him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) together, thereby in the first place put the vital airs into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), being about to put him together, thereby in the first place put the vital airs into him. They (the furrows) are lines, for these vital airs (move) in lines (channels).

<span id="v7_2_2_1919"><sup><small>7:2:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  Four furrows he ploughs with prayer: he thereby puts into him those four well-defined vital airs which are in the head; and this (he does) with prayer,—true is the prayer, and true (manifest, real) are these vital airs in the head.

<span id="v7_2_2_2020"><sup><small>7:2:2:2020.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he ploughs through the body: he thereby puts into him those vital airs which are inside the body. Silently (he does so), for who knows how many vital airs there are inside the body?

<span id="v7_2_2_2121"><sup><small>7:2:2:2121.</small></sup></span>  Having gained the object for which he yokes those (oxen), he now unyokes them, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 73), ‘Be ye unyoked, ye inviolable (oxen)!’ for inviolable [^631] they indeed are with the gods;—‘Ye god ward-striding!’ for with them he performs the divine work;—‘We have come to the end of this gloom;’—gloom doubtless means famine: thus, ‘we have come to the end of this famine;’—‘we have attained the light!’ for he who attains the gods, the sacrifice, indeed attains the light. He then lets them loose towards north-east—the significance of this has been explained [^632]. He gives them to the Adhvaryu, for it is he that does the work with them: let him assign them (to him) at the time of (the presentation of) the Dakshi<i>n</i>âs.


<span id="p332"><sup><small>[ p. 332 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="v7_2_3"><sup><small>7:2:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v7_2_3_11"><sup><small>7:2:3:11.</small></sup></span>  He then places a bunch of darbha (ku<i>s</i>a) grass (poa cynosuroides) on (the middle of the altar-site); for the gods then placed plants thereon, and in like manner does the Sacrificer now place plants thereon.

<span id="v7_2_3_22"><sup><small>7:2:3:22.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he places a bunch of grass thereon;—when he (Agni) is built up, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but these darbha plants (contain) both kinds of food, for they are both water and plants. Now the waters which, loathing V<i>ri</i>tra, rose up on the dry land forming bushes, became those grasses [^633],—inasmuch as they rose forming bushes (d<i>ri</i>bh), they are (called) darbha-grasses. These darbha-grasses, then, are the water (which remained) pure, and meet for sacrifice, when V<i>ri</i>tra flowed towards it; and inasmuch as they are darbha-grasses, they are plants: by both kinds of food he thus gratifies him (Agni).

<span id="v7_2_3_33"><sup><small>7:2:3:33.</small></sup></span>  \[He places it\] at the meeting of the furrows, for the meeting of furrows is speech (the mouth) [^634], and the furrows (channels) are the vital airs; and this is their place of meeting; and in the mouth food is put for the vital airs. In the middle (he places the bunch), whereby he puts it into the very <span id="p333"><sup><small>[ p. 333 ]</small></sup></span> middle of him; silently (he does so), for what is silent is undefined, and the undefined is everything: with everything he thus puts food into him.

<span id="v7_2_3_44"><sup><small>7:2:3:44.</small></sup></span>  He then offers thereon,—when he (Agni) is built, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but that ghee is the life-sap (essence) of this universe, for it is the life-sap of both the waters and plants: he thus gratifies him by the life-sap of this universe. And as far as the life-sap extends, so far extends the body: he thus gratifies him by this universe. With (ghee) taken in five (ladlings, he offers),—the fire-altar consists of five layers, five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v7_2_3_55"><sup><small>7:2:3:55.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he offers thereon;—when in the beginning the <i>Ri</i>shis, the vital airs [^635], put together this Agni, they gained for themselves that fore-share [^636] in him: hence they are the fore-sharers. Thus when he offers on (the grass-bush) he thereby gratifies those Rishis, the vital airs, who gained for themselves the fore-share in him (Agni). With fivefold-taken ghee (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.

With <span id="p334"><sup><small>[ p. 334 ]</small></sup></span> fivefold-taken ghee (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_2_3_77"><sup><small>7:2:3:77.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he offers thereon;—at that time the gods were afraid, thinking, ‘Long indeed is this performance: we hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!’ They saw this preliminary conclusion [^637] of this performance, and brought that whole (Agni) to completion even at that (point), and built him up then; and in like manner this (Sacrificer) brings that whole (Agni) to completion even at this (point), and builds him now.

<span id="v7_2_3_99"><sup><small>7:2:3:99.</small></sup></span>  There are thirteen utterings,—thirteen months are a year; thirteen in number are the layers of bricks and earth of the fire-altar: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. With butter he sacrifices,—butter is the <span id="p335"><sup><small>[ p. 335 ]</small></sup></span> same as Agni: it is Agni he thus builds up. With fivefold-taken (butter he offers),—the altar consists of five layers,—five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. He offers raising (the spoon) upwards: he thus builds Agni upwards by means of the layers (of the altar).

<span id="v7_2_4_11"><sup><small>7:2:4:11.</small></sup></span>  He then pours out jarfuls of water,—for the gods then said, ‘Meditate ye (<i>k</i>etay)!’ whereby they doubtless meant to say, ‘Seek ye a layer (<i>k</i>itim)!’ Whilst meditating they saw the rain to be a (suitable) layer, and put it on that (altar-site); and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put it thereon.

<span id="v7_2_4_22"><sup><small>7:2:4:22.</small></sup></span>  Jarfuls of water are (poured out); for rain is water: it is rain he thereby bestows on it. With an udumbara jar (he pours them on): the significance of this has been told;—with a four-cornered one;—four quarters there are: from all quarters he thus bestows rain thereon.

<span id="v7_2_4_33"><sup><small>7:2:4:33.</small></sup></span>  Three jarfuls he pours out each time [^638],—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows rain thereon.

<span id="v7_2_4_44"><sup><small>7:2:4:44.</small></sup></span>  Twelve jarfuls of water he pours on the ploughed ground,—twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus bestows rain thereon. <span id="p336"><sup><small>[ p. 336 ]</small></sup></span> 7:2:4:55\. On the ploughed ground he pours (water), whence it rains for (the benefit of) the ploughed land. Now were he only to pour it on the ploughed ground, and not on the unploughed, it would only rain for the ploughed land, not for the unploughed. And were he only to pour it on the unploughed ground, and not on the ploughed, it would only rain for the unploughed land, and not for the ploughed. He pours it both on the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground; whence it rains both for the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground.

<span id="v7_2_4_66"><sup><small>7:2:4:66.</small></sup></span>  Three (jarfuls) [^639] he pours both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground;—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows rain thereon.

<span id="v7_2_4_77"><sup><small>7:2:4:77.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he pours out jarfuls of water;—at that time the gods, being about to put him (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati) together, in the first place put water into him; and in like manner does this one now, being about to put him together, in the first place put water into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_88"><sup><small>7:2:4:88.</small></sup></span>  Three jarfuls he pours out each time,—threefold is Agni: as large as Agni is, as large as is his measure, by so much he thus puts water into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_99"><sup><small>7:2:4:99.</small></sup></span>  Twelve jarfuls he pours on the ploughed ground,—twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts water into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_1010"><sup><small>7:2:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  On the ploughed ground he pours it: he thereby puts water into the vital airs. But were he to pour (water) only on the ploughed ground, and <span id="p337"><sup><small>[ p. 337 ]</small></sup></span> not on the unploughed, there would be water only in (the channels of) the vital airs, and not in the other (parts of the) body. And were he to pour (water) only on the unploughed ground, and not on the ploughed, there would be water only in (the other parts of) the body, and not in the vital airs. He pours it both on the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground, whence there is water here both in (the channels of) the vital airs and in the body.

<span id="v7_2_4_1111"><sup><small>7:2:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  Three (jarfuls) he pours both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground;—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts water into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_1212"><sup><small>7:2:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  Fifteen jarfuls of water he pours out,—fifteenfold is the thunderbolt: by that fifteenfold thunderbolt of his he thus drives away all evil.

<span id="v7_2_4_1313"><sup><small>7:2:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then sows all (kinds of) herb (-seed);—for the gods then said, ‘Meditate ye!’ whereby doubtless they meant to say, ‘Seek ye a layer!’ whilst meditating, they saw food to be a (suitable) layer, and put that on (or, into) him (Agni); and in like manner does this one now put it into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_1414"><sup><small>7:2:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  It is (seed) of all herbs,—all herbs means all food; he thus puts all (kinds of) food into him. Let him omit one of those kinds of food, and not eat thereof as long as he lives. By means of the udumbara jar (he sows the seed): the significance of this has been explained;—with a four-cornered one,—there are four quarters: from all quarters he thus puts food into him (Agni). He sows it with anush<i>t</i>ubh (verses),—the Anush<i>t</i>ubh (metre) is speech, and by means of speech (the mouth [^640]) food is eaten. <span id="p338"><sup><small>[ p. 338 ]</small></sup></span> 7:2:4:1515\. With three verses he sows each time [^641],—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_1616"><sup><small>7:2:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  With twelve verses he sows on the ploughed ground,—twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_1717"><sup><small>7:2:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  On the ploughed ground he sows, whence food ripens on ploughed ground.

He sows on both the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground: hence food ripens both on ploughed, and on unploughed, ground.

<span id="v7_2_4_1818"><sup><small>7:2:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  With three (verses) he sows both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts food into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_1919"><sup><small>7:2:4:1919.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he sows all (kinds of) herb (-seed),—the gods at that time, being about to put him (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati) together, in the first place healed him by healing medicine; and in like manner does this one now, being about to put him together, first heal him with healing medicine.

<span id="v7_2_4_2020"><sup><small>7:2:4:2020.</small></sup></span>  It is (seed) of all herbs;—all herbs is the <span id="p339"><sup><small>[ p. 339 ]</small></sup></span> same as all (kinds of) medicine: by all (kinds of) healing medicine he thus heals him.

<span id="v7_2_4_2121"><sup><small>7:2:4:2121.</small></sup></span>  With three verses he sows each time,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus heals him.

<span id="v7_2_4_2323"><sup><small>7:2:4:2323.</small></sup></span>  On the ploughed ground he sows: he thereby heals the vital airs. And were he to sow only on the ploughed ground, and not on the unploughed, he would only heal the vital airs, and not the other (parts of the) body; and were he to sow only on the unploughed, and not on the ploughed, ground, he would only heal the body, and not the vital airs: he sows both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground; and thus he heals both the vital airs and the body.

<span id="v7_2_4_2424"><sup><small>7:2:4:2424.</small></sup></span>  With three (verses) he sows both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus heals him.

<span id="v7_2_4_2525"><sup><small>7:2:4:2525.</small></sup></span>  Fifteen jarfuls of water he pours out, and with fifteen verses he sows,—that makes thirty,—the Virâ<i>g</i> (metre) consists of thirty syllables, and the Virâ<i>g</i> (the far-shining, or far-ruling) is the whole food: the whole food he thus puts into him.

<span id="v7_2_4_2626"><sup><small>7:2:4:2626.</small></sup></span>  \[He sows, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 75 seq.; <i>Ri</i>k S.

<span id="v7_2_4_2727"><sup><small>7:2:4:2727.</small></sup></span>  ‘Yours, O Mother, are a hundred powers, and yours a thousand growths,’—inasmuch as (the plants) here are shooting out a hundredfold, and a thousandfold;—‘Ye of a hundred virtues, render ye free from sickness this one of mine!’ that is, him whom I am now healing.

<span id="v7_2_4_2828"><sup><small>7:2:4:2828.</small></sup></span>  These (verses) [^644] have one and the same explanation <span id="p341"><sup><small>[ p. 341 ]</small></sup></span> with regard to this (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati),how he may heal him, and preserve him. They are anush<i>t</i>ubh verses,—the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech, and speech is all healing medicine: by means of all healing medicine he thus heals him.

The outer forms are defined, and the inner ones are undefined; and Agni is the same as an animal: hence the outer forms of the animal are defined, and the inner ones undefined.

## Footnotes

[^610]: 320:1 Or (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's), Agni's self, or body.

[^611]: 321:1 Or probably, a barren spot, see [p. 43](../Book_3_5_2#p43), note [2](../Book_3_5_2#fn101).

[^612]: 321:2 That is, whilst himself remaining north of the place, and facing the south, he puts them down in the direction from north to south.

[^613]: 321:3 That is, he performs the formal ceremony of ‘laying down (upadhâna)’ whilst muttering the respective verses. In the present case the ‘laying down’ of the bricks is to be performed by him whilst muttering the formulas, but without touching the bricks themselves. The direction that the bricks are to be deposited in a direction ‘away from him’ perhaps refers to the ‘laying down’ instead of to the actual placing them.

[^614]: 323:1 According to Sâya<i>n</i>a the sling of the gold plate is here singled out, because the other objects have necessarily been damaged by the hot fire-pan and are consequently thrown away as a matter of course.

[^615]: 323:2 See III, 4, 1, 22. In the formula ‘âyus’ may rather have to be taken in the sense of ‘life,’ or ‘vital power.’ Mahîdhara takes ‘na’ in the sense of ‘now (samprati),’ instead of ‘as.’

[^616]: 325:1 Mahîdhara takes ‘samare pathînâm’ in the sense of ‘in the battle of (i.e. with) the waylayers (paripanthibhi<i>h</i> saha).’

[^617]: 325:2 See part ii, p. 47 seq.

[^618]: 325:3 Viz. by calling out three times ‘Havishk<i>ri</i>t, come hither,’ whereby the Adhvaryu summons one of the priests, or maidservants, to assist in preparing the material for offering. See part i, p. 27 seq.

[^619]: 325:4 Part i, p. 55 seq.

[^620]: 325:5 Part i, p. 59 seq.

[^621]: 325:6 See part i, p. 55. It must, however, be borne in mind that the passage here referred to relates to the construction of the Vedi of an ordinary ish<i>t</i>i, whilst in the present instance we have to do with a Mahâvedi, as prescribed for Soma-sacrifices (cf. part ii, p. 111 seq., where, however, only a few distinctive points are adverted to). The plan of the Mahâvedi, given at the end of part ii, shows at the eastern end a square mound, the so-called uttara-vedi, or higher, upper altar, on which the Âhavanîya, or offering, fire is maintained. On a similar earth mound, but raised in the centre of the square site (see [VII, 3, 1, 27](../Book_3_7_3#v7_3_1_27)), the Agni<i>k</i>ayana requires the erection of the large brick fire-altar, the preparation of the site of which is explained from the next paragraph.

[^622]: 326:1 That is ‘sa + irâ,’ with draught or food.

[^623]: 326:2 Or rather, put (the oxen) to the ploughs. Professor Ludwig takes ‘sîrâ’ in the sense of ‘straps, traces,’—the skilful fasten the traces.

[^624]: 327:1 Or, concession (Erhörung).

[^625]: 327:2 That is, from the right thigh to the right shoulder (south-west to south-east).

[^626]: 328:1 That is, from the right thigh to the left thigh (south-west to north-west). Whilst the first furrow was ploughed from the southwest to the south-east corner, the present and two following furrows are ploughed ‘sunwise’ from south-west to north-west, north-west to north-east, and north-east to south-east respectively. We are not told in what manner the plough is to be got back from the southeast to the south-west corner after the ploughing of the first furrow, whether it is to be carried there, or to be pulled back outside the enclosed square.

[^627]: 328:2 That is, from the left thigh to the left shoulder (north-west to north-east).

[^628]: 328:3 Or, the metal-shod. The author's reason for interpreting ‘pavîravat’ by ‘rayimat’ is not clear.

[^629]: 328:4 According to the St. Petersburg dictionary, ‘somapitsaru’ is probably a corrupt form, like the various readings ‘somasatsaru’ (Ath. S. III, 17, 3) and ‘sumatitsaru’ (Taitt. S. IV, 2, 5, 6 = ‘moving up and down,’ Sâya<i>n</i>a). Cf. Vâsish<i>th</i>a Dharma<i>s</i>âstra (Bühler's translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiv, p. 13), where ‘somapitsaru’ p. 329 is explained in the text as meaning ‘provided with a handle (tsaru) for the Soma-drinker’ (somapi). Also Indische Studien, XVII, p. 259, where Professor Weber proposes to divide the word ‘somasatsaru’ into ‘soma(n),’ with thongs, and ‘sa-tsaru,’ with handle. If ‘somapi-tsaru’ really represent the constituent elements, ‘tsaru,’ handle, may indeed be intended as having special reference to the handle of the Soma-cup (<i>k</i>amasa); though ‘somapi’ could only be taken in the sense of ‘Soma-drinker,’ and not in that of ‘Soma-cup,’ optionally suggested by Mahîdhara.

[^630]: 329:1 That is, from the left to the right shoulder (north-east to southeast).

[^631]: 329:2 Or, perhaps, thus it goes to the gods; this tends godward. Whilst the last three furrows are indeed ploughed ‘sunwise’ (east to south, &c.), the first furrow was ploughed in the opposite direction (south-west to south-east). The reason for this is that the whole performance is to take place in an easterly direction, so as to tend towards the gods. Were he to start at the south-east corner, and then plough right round, he would be moving away from the gods, who are supposed to reside in the east.

[^632]: 330:1 Here, again, the sunwise motion of the plough only applies to the three last furrows (or sets of furrows), which always move from left to right,—south-west to north-east, east to west, northwest to south-east. The first set of furrows—drawn from south to north, or along the ‘cross-spine’ (as distinguished from the real, or easterly spine running from west to east)—are apparently drawn in this way, in order to avoid the southerly direction, as that would imply speedy death to the Sacrificer,—his going to the Fathers, or deceased ancestors, who are supposed to reside in the south. In drawing the furrows in the way they do, the priests not only avoid that region, but at the very outset move away from it, and thereby assure long life to the Sacrificer.

[^633]: 331:1 See part ii, p. 216, note 2, where ‘aghnyâ’ was used of cows.

[^634]: 331:2 See [VI, 4, 4, 22](../Book_3_6_4#v6_4_4_22). The plough is put aside on the utkara (heap of rubbish).

[^635]: 332:1 The author here alludes to the legend given at I, 1, 3, 4-5,—V<i>ri</i>tra lay enveloping all that space which extends between heaven and earth, and because he lay enveloping (v<i>ri</i>) all that, he is called V<i>ri</i>tra. Him Indra slew. Being slain, he flowed stinking in all directions towards the water; for in every direction lies the ocean. Now some of the water loathed him, it rose higher and higher and flowed over: hence (sprang) these ku<i>s</i>a grasses,—they are indeed the water which was not putrified; but with the other water some (matter) has indeed become mixed when the putrid V<i>ri</i>tra flowed into it.

[^636]: 332:2 See [p. 200](../Book_3_6_3#p200), note [3](../Book_3_6_3#fn413).

[^637]: 333:1 See [VI, 1, 1, 1](../Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_1).

[^638]: 333:2 Literally, a share in front, in the first place, i.e. a preferential share, or fore-taste. Being accented separately, ‘purastât’ here, however, forms no compound with ‘bhâga;’ though it does in ‘purastâdbhâga,’ fore-sharer. Cf. Taitt. S. V, 6, 4, 2.

[^639]: 334:1 Literally, a conclusion previously, or at the beginning of the performance.

[^640]: 335:1 On every four of the sixteen furrows, in the order in which they have been ploughed, he is to empty three jarfuls of water, making altogether twelve jars of water.

[^641]: 336:1 These are additional three jarfuls poured over the whole Agnikshetra, or site of the altar.

[^642]: 337:1 See [p. 200](../Book_3_6_3#p200), note [3](../Book_3_6_3#fn413).

[^643]: 338:1 The sowing of the seed is done after the manner of the watering of the site, viz. so as to finish the sowing of every four furrows with the completion of the muttering of three verses (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 75-86); whereupon the remaining seed is scattered over the whole site with additional three verses (87-89).

[^644]: 339:1 Thus the St. Petersburg dictionary; while Professor Ludwig construes ‘triyugam purâ’ together,—‘the herbs first come from p. 340 the gods before the three ages;’—but is there any other example of ‘purâ’ with the accusative? The author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, on the other hand, takes ‘triyugam purâ’ as adverbs independent of each other,—‘formerly at three periods.’

[^645]: 340:1 Or, consists of herbs.

[^646]: 340:2 That is, the two verses just explained, as well as the remaining thirteen verses (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 77 seq.; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 97, 3 seq.), viz.:—
  3\. Rejoice ye at the plants, the full-budded, abounding in shoots: like victorious mares, the herbs are eager to win (or, to save).
  4\. As plants, O divine mothers, I call upon you: horse, and cow, and raiment would I win, and thine own self, O Purusha!
  5\. On the A<i>s</i>vattha tree is your abode, on the Par<i>n</i>a dwelling is made for you: possessed of cattle shall ye be, when ye save the Purusha.
  6\. Wherein the herbs have met together, even as the nobles in the assembly, that priest is called physician, demon-killer, pain-remover.
  7\. The (herb) rich in horses, the one rich in Soma, the p. 341 strengthening, most powerful,—all herbs have I found for healthfulness to him (the Purusha).
  8\. Forth rush the energies of the plants, like kine from the stable, eager to win wealth, eager to win wealth, O Purusha!
  9\. Strength-giving (ishk<i>ri</i>ti) is the name of your mother, hence ye are healing powers (nishk<i>ri</i>ti): winged furrows ye are; what ye make sick, ye heal.
  10\. All obstacles have they overcome, even as the thief the cow-pen; the herbs have expelled whatever defect of the body there was.
  11\. When, to give strength, I take these herbs in my hand, the self of Yakshman (consumption) perishes, as from the clutches of the living (? i.e. from death, Ludw.).
  12\. Whose every limb, whose every joint ye, O herbs, flow through, from him ye chase away (the demon) Yakshman,—mighty (he is) and, as it were, abiding in the core.
  13\. Fly forth, O Yakshman; together with the garrulous jay; vanish with the gliding of the wind, with the whirlwind (?)!
  14\. May one of you help the other, may ye lend help to one another! Of one mind, help ye forward this word of mine!
  15\. Those bearing fruit, and those without fruit, the flowerless and the flowering, urged forward by B<i>ri</i>haspati, may they preserve us from trouble!
  The Vâ<i>g</i>. S. also gives the remaining verses of the hymn, which are not, however, required on the present occasion.
