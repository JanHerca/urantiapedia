## THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_3_1_11"><sup><small>5:3:1:11.</small></sup></span>  Having taken up both (the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya) fires on the two kindling-sticks [^126], he goes to the house of the Commander of the army, and prepares a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Anîkavat; for Agni is the head (anîka) of the gods, and the commander is the head of the army: hence for Agni Anîkavat. And he, the commander, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels [^127]: it is for <span id="p59"><sup><small>[ p. 59 ]</small></sup></span> him that he is thereby consecrated (or quickened), and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel-offering) consists in gold; for Agni's is that sacrifice, and gold is Agni's seed: therefore the sacrificial fee consists in gold.

<span id="v5_3_1_22"><sup><small>5:3:1:22.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Purohita (the king's court chaplain), and prepares a pap for B<i>ri</i>haspati; for B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Purohita of the gods, and that (court chaplain) is the Purohita (‘praepositus’) of that (king): hence it is for B<i>ri</i>haspati. And he, the Purohita, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this is a white-backed bullock; for to B<i>ri</i>haspati belongs that upper region, and there above lies that path of Aryaman (the sun) [^128]: therefore the fee for the Bârhaspatya (oblation) is a white-backed (bullock).

<span id="v5_3_1_33"><sup><small>5:3:1:33.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra at the dwelling of him who is being consecrated (the king); for Indra is the Kshatra (ruling power), and he who is consecrated is <span id="p60"><sup><small>[ p. 60 ]</small></sup></span> the Kshatra: hence it is for Indra. The sacrificial fee for this is a bull, for the bull is Indra's own (animal).

<span id="v5_3_1_44"><sup><small>5:3:1:44.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day, he goes to the dwelling of the Queen, and prepares a pap for Aditi; for Aditi is this Earth, and she is the wife of the gods; and that (queen) is the wife of that (king): hence it is for Aditi. And she, the Queen, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for her that he is thereby consecrated, and he makes her his own faithful (wife). The sacrificial fee, on her part, is a milch cow; for this (earth) is, as it were, a milch cow: she yields to men all their desires; and the milch cow is a mother, and this (earth) is, as it were, a mother: she bears (or sustains) men. Hence the fee is a milch cow.

<span id="v5_3_1_55"><sup><small>5:3:1:55.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Sûta (court-minstrel and chronicler), and prepares a barley pap for Varu<i>n</i>a; for the Sûta is a spiriter (sava), and Varu<i>n</i>a is the spiriter of the gods: therefore it is for Varu<i>n</i>a. And he, the Sûta, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated; and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this one is a horse, for the horse is Varu<i>n</i>a's own.

<span id="v5_3_1_66"><sup><small>5:3:1:66.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Headman (Grâma<i>n</i>î [^129]), and prepares a cake <span id="p61"><sup><small>[ p. 61 ]</small></sup></span> on seven potsherds for the Maruts; for the Maruts are the peasants, and the headman is a peasant: therefore it is for the Maruts. And he, the headman, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a spotted bullock, for in such a spotted bullock there is abundance of colours; and the Maruts are the clans (or peasants), and the clan means abundance; therefore the sacrificial fee is a spotted bullock.

<span id="v5_3_1_77"><sup><small>5:3:1:77.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day he goes to the house of the Chamberlain (kshatt<i>ri</i>), and prepares a cake on either twelve, or eight, potsherds for Savit<i>ri</i>; for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) of the gods, and the chamberlain is an impeller: hence it is for Savit<i>ri</i>. And he, the chamberlain, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he thereby is consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a reddish-white draught-bullock; for Savit<i>ri</i> is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed moves along; and the draught-bullock also moves along, when yoked. And as to why it is a reddish-white one;—reddish-white indeed is he (the sun) both in rising and in setting: therefore the sacrificial fee is a reddish-white draught-bullock.

<span id="v5_3_1_88"><sup><small>5:3:1:88.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day he goes to the house <span id="p62"><sup><small>[ p. 62 ]</small></sup></span> of the Charioteer (sa<i>m</i>grahît<i>ri</i>), and prepares a cake on two potsherds for the A<i>s</i>vins; for the two A<i>s</i>vins are of the same womb; and so are the chariot fighter [^130] and the driver (sârathi) of the same womb (standing-place), since they stand on one and the same chariot: hence it is for the A<i>s</i>vins. And he, the charioteer, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a pair of twin bullocks, for such twin bullocks are of the same womb. If he cannot obtain twins, two bullocks produced by successive births (of the same cow) may also form the sacrificial fee, for such also are of the same womb.

<span id="v5_3_1_99"><sup><small>5:3:1:99.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day he goes to the house <span id="p63"><sup><small>[ p. 63 ]</small></sup></span> of the Carver (bhâgadugha [^131]), and prepares a pap for Pûshan, for Pûshan is carver to the gods; and that (officer) is carver to that (king): therefore it is for Pûshan. And he, the carver, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a dark-grey bullock: the significance of such a one being the same as at the Trisha<i>m</i>yukta [^132].

<span id="v5_3_1_1010"><sup><small>5:3:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day, having brought together gavedhukâ (seeds) from the houses of the Keeper of the dice (akshâvâpa [^133]) and the Huntsman (govikartana [^134]), he prepares a gavedhukâ pap for Rudra at the house of him who is consecrated. These two, while being two jewels (of the king), he makes one for the purpose of completeness. And as to why he performs this offering,—Rudra is hankering after that (cow) which is killed here in this hall; <span id="p64"><sup><small>[ p. 64 ]</small></sup></span> now Rudra is Agni (fire), and the gaming-board being fire, and the dice being its coals, it is him (Rudra) he thereby pleases. And verily whosoever, that knows this thus, performs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, in his house that approved (cow) is killed. And he, the keeper of dice, and the huntsman, are (each of them) assuredly one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for these two that he is thereby consecrated, and these two he makes his own faithful followers. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a bicoloured bullock—either one with white fore-feet, or a white-tailed one,—a claw-shaped knife, and a dice-board [^135] with a horsehair band [^136]; for that is what belongs to those two [^137].

<span id="v5_3_1_1111"><sup><small>5:3:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day he goes to the house of the Courier, and having taken ghee in four ladlings, he offers the ghee to the way, with, ‘May the way graciously accept of the ghee, hail!’ For the courier is to be dispatched, and when dispatched goes on his way: therefore he offers the ghee to the way. And he, the courier, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) consists in a skin-covered bow, leathern quivers, and a red turban, for that is what belongs to him.

<span id="v5_3_1_1212"><sup><small>5:3:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  These are the eleven jewels (ratna) he completes; for of eleven syllables consists the Trish<i>t</i>ubh, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is vigour: it is for the sake <span id="p65"><sup><small>[ p. 65 ]</small></sup></span> of vigour that he completes the (eleven) jewels. Then as to why he performs the oblations of the Ratnins: it is their king he becomes; it is for them that he thereby is consecrated, and it is them he makes his own faithful followers.

<span id="v5_3_1_1313"><sup><small>5:3:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  And on the following day he goes to the house of a discarded (wife), and prepares a pap for Nir<i>ri</i>ti;—a discarded wife is one who has no son. He cooks the pap for Nir<i>ri</i>ti of black rice, after splitting the grains with his nails. He offers it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 3), ‘This, O Nir<i>ri</i>ti, is thy share: accept it graciously, hail!’ For a wife that is without a son, is possessed with Nir<i>ri</i>ti (destruction, calamity); and whatever of Nir<i>ri</i>ti's nature there is in her, that he thereby propitiates, and thus Nir<i>ri</i>ti does not take possession of him while he is consecrated. The fee for this (oblation) consists of a black, decrepit, diseased cow; for such a one also is possessed with Nir<i>ri</i>ti. He says to her (the wife), 'Let her not dwell this day in my dominion [^138]! thus he removes evil from himself.


<span id="v5_3_2"><sup><small>5:3:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_3_2_11"><sup><small>5:3:2:11.</small></sup></span>  After the ‘jewels’ he offers (a pap) to Soma and Rudra. It is cooked in milk from a white (cow) which has a white calf. And as to why, after the ‘jewels,’ he offers (a pap) to Soma and Rudra.

<span id="v5_3_2_22"><sup><small>5:3:2:22.</small></sup></span>  Now, once upon a time, Svarbhânu, the Âsura, struck the sun with darkness, and stricken with darkness he did not shine [^139]. Soma and Rudra <span id="p66"><sup><small>[ p. 66 ]</small></sup></span> removed that darkness of his; and freed from evil he burns yonder. And in like manner does that (king) thereby enter darkness,—or darkness enters him,—when he puts those unworthy of sacrifice [^140] in contact with the sacrifice; and he does indeed now put those unworthy of sacrifice—either <i>S</i>ûdras or whomever else—in contact with the sacrifice. It is Soma and Rudra who remove that darkness of his; and freed from evil he becomes consecrated. And as to why it is cooked in milk from a white (cow) which has a white calf,—darkness is black: that darkness he removes. The sacrificial fee for this (oblation) is a white (cow) which has a white calf.

<span id="v5_3_2_33"><sup><small>5:3:2:33.</small></sup></span>  Even he who, while being qualified for fame, is not yet famous, may perform that offering. Now he who is learned (in the Veda), while being qualified for fame, is not famous; and he who is not famous, is covered with darkness: that darkness of his Soma and Rudra thereby remove; and freed from evil he becomes a very light by his prosperity and renown.

<span id="v5_3_2_44"><sup><small>5:3:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he prepares a pap for Mitra and B<i>ri</i>haspati [^141]. For verily he who departs from the <span id="p67"><sup><small>[ p. 67 ]</small></sup></span> path of the sacrifice stumbles; and he does indeed depart from the path of the sacrifice, when he puts those unworthy of sacrifice in contact with the sacrifice, and he does indeed now put those unworthy of sacrifice—either <i>S</i>ûdras or whomever else—in contact with the sacrifice. And the path of the sacrifice is Mitra and B<i>ri</i>haspati; for Mitra is the Brahman, and the Brahman is the sacrifice; and B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and the Brahman is the sacrifice. Thus he, returns again to the path of the sacrifice; and as soon as he has returned to the path of the sacrifice he is consecrated: therefore he prepares a pap for Mitra and B<i>ri</i>haspati.

<span id="v5_3_2_55"><sup><small>5:3:2:55.</small></sup></span>  The course of this (is as follows). Any a<i>s</i>vattha branch broken off by itself, either on the eastern or on the northern side (of the tree), from that he makes a vessel (to hold the pap) for Mitra; for that which is hewn by the axe belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a; but that which is broken off by itself belongs to Mitra: therefore he makes the vessel for Mitra from a branch broken off by itself.

<span id="v5_3_2_66"><sup><small>5:3:2:66.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon having curdled the (milk into) curds, and poured it into a leathern bag; and having put (the horses) to the cart, and fastened (the bag on the cart), he tells it to ‘fly away.’ This is that (kind of) fresh butter which is self-produced [^142]; for that which is churned belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a, and that which is self-produced belongs to Mitra: therefore it is self-produced butter.

<span id="v5_3_2_77"><sup><small>5:3:2:77.</small></sup></span>  They divide the rice-grains into two parts: the smaller and broken ones belong to B<i>ri</i>haspati, <span id="p68"><sup><small>[ p. 68 ]</small></sup></span> and the larger and unbroken ones to Mitra. For Mitra injures no one, nor does any one injure Mitra; neither a ku<i>s</i>a stalk nor a thorn pricks him, nor has he any scar; for Mitra is every one's friend (mitram).

<span id="v5_3_2_88"><sup><small>5:3:2:88.</small></sup></span>  He then puts the pap for B<i>ri</i>haspati on (the fire), covers it with the vessel for Mitra's (pap), pours the butter (into the latter), and throws in the (larger) rice-grains. It is cooked merely by the hot steam [1](../Book_3_5_3#fn143); for what is cooked by fire belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a, and what is cooked by hot steam belongs to Mitra: therefore it is cooked by hot steam. Making cuttings from both these sacrificial dishes, he says, ‘Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Mitra and B<i>ri</i>haspati!’ Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to Mitra and B<i>ri</i>haspati!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered.


<span id="v5_3_3"><sup><small>5:3:3</small></sup></span>

### THE ABHISHE<i>K</i>ANÎYA [^144], OR CONSECRATION CEREMONY.

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_3_3_11"><sup><small>5:3:3:11.</small></sup></span>  He performs the initiation ceremony. On the day of preparation he seizes the victim for Agni <span id="p69"><sup><small>[ p. 69 ]</small></sup></span> and Soma. Having performed the offering of the omentum thereof; he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma [^145]. Thereupon the offerings of the Divine Quickeners (Devasû) are prepared.

<span id="v5_3_3_22"><sup><small>5:3:3:22.</small></sup></span>  For Savit<i>ri</i> Satyaprasava (of true impulse) he prepares a cake from fast-grown (plâ<i>s</i>uka) rice [^146], on either twelve, or eight, potsherds; for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) of the gods: ‘May I be quickened [^147], impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>!’ thus (he thinks). And as to (its being) of fast-grown rice: ‘May they quickly impel me!’ he thinks.

<span id="v5_3_3_33"><sup><small>5:3:3:33.</small></sup></span>  For Agni G<i>ri</i>hapati (the house-lord) he then prepares a cake on eight potsherds from quick-grown (â<i>s</i>u) rice [^148]; for the house-lord's position means prosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, over <span id="p70"><sup><small>[ p. 70 ]</small></sup></span> that Agni, the house-lord, leads him to hold the position of a master of the house. And as to its being of quick-grown rice: ‘May they quickly lead me!’ so he thinks.

<span id="v5_3_3_44"><sup><small>5:3:3:44.</small></sup></span>  For Soma Vanaspati (the wood-lord or tree) he then prepares a pap of <i>s</i>yâmâka millet: thereby Soma, the wood-lord, quickens him for the plants. And as to its being prepared of <i>s</i>yâmâka,—they, the <i>s</i>yâmâkas among plants doubtless are most manifestly Soma's own: therefore it is prepared of <i>s</i>yâmâka grain.

<span id="v5_3_3_55"><sup><small>5:3:3:55.</small></sup></span>  For B<i>ri</i>haspati Vâ<i>k</i> [^149] (speech) he then prepares a pap of wild rice: thereby B<i>ri</i>haspati quickens him for speech. And as to its being prepared of wild rice,—B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman, and they, the wild rice-plants, are ripened by the Brahman [^150]: hence it is prepared of wild rice.

<span id="v5_3_3_66"><sup><small>5:3:3:66.</small></sup></span>  For Indra <i>G</i>yesh<i>th</i>a (the most excellent) he then prepares a pap of red rice-grains (hâyana) [^151]: thereby Indra, the most excellent, leads him to excellence (or, lordship). And as to its being prepared of red rice: outstanding doubtless are those plants, the red rice, and outstanding is Indra: therefore it is prepared of red rice.

<span id="v5_3_3_77"><sup><small>5:3:3:77.</small></sup></span>  For Rudra Pa<i>s</i>upati (lord of beasts) he then prepares a Raudra pap of gavedhukâ seeds (coix barbata): thereby Rudra, the lord of beasts, quickens <span id="p71"><sup><small>[ p. 71 ]</small></sup></span> him for cattle. And as to its being prepared of gavedhukâ seed;—that God is (the recipient of) refuse (remains of offering), and gavedhukâ seeds are refuse: therefore it is (prepared) of gavedhukâ seed.

<span id="v5_3_3_88"><sup><small>5:3:3:88.</small></sup></span>  For Mitra Satya (the True) he then prepares a pap of Nâmba [^152] seed: thereby Mitra the True quickens him for the Brahman. And as to its being prepared of Nâmba seed,—to Varu<i>n</i>a, no doubt, belong those plants which grow in ploughed ground; but those, the Nâmba plants, belong to Mitra: therefore it is (prepared) of Nâmba seed.

<span id="v5_3_3_99"><sup><small>5:3:3:99.</small></sup></span>  For Varu<i>n</i>a Dharmapati (the lord of the law) he then prepares a Varu<i>n</i>a pap of barley: thereby Varu<i>n</i>a, the lord of the law, makes him lord of the law; and that truly is the supreme state, when one is lord of the law; for whosoever attains to the supreme state, to him they come in (matters of) law: therefore to Varu<i>n</i>a Dharmapati.

<span id="v5_3_3_1010"><sup><small>5:3:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then proceeds with the cake for Agni-Soma. The Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of that (oblation) remains yet unoffered, when he proceeds with those (other) oblations.

<span id="v5_3_3_1111"><sup><small>5:3:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon, taking hold of him (the Sacrificer) by the right arm, he mutters (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 39, 40), ‘May Savit<i>ri</i> quicken thee for (powers of) quickening (ruling) [^153], Agni for householders, Soma for trees, B<i>ri</i>haspati for speech, Indra for lordship, Rudra for cattle, Mitra for truth, Varu<i>n</i>a for the lord of the law.’

<span id="v5_3_3_1212"><sup><small>5:3:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘Quicken him, O gods, to be unrivalled!’ <span id="p72"><sup><small>[ p. 72 ]</small></sup></span> —he thereby says, ‘Quicken him, O gods, so as to be without an enemy; for great chiefdom, for great lordship!’ in this there is nothing obscure;—‘for man-rule!’ ‘for the ruling of men,’ he thereby says;—'for Indra's energy!' ‘for vigour’ he means to say when he says, 'for Indra's energy;'—‘him, the son of such and such (a man), the son of such and such (a woman),’—whatever be his parentage, with reference to that he says this;—‘of such and such a people,’ that is to say, of the people whose king he is;—‘this man, O ye (people) [^154], is your king, Soma is the king of us Brahmans!’ He thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the king); the Brâhman alone he excepts: therefore the Brâhman is not to be fed upon, for he has Soma for his king.

<span id="v5_3_3_1313"><sup><small>5:3:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  Now those gods have the power of quickening, whence their name ‘devasû’ (Divine Quickeners). It is those gods who now quicken him thus, and quickened (consecrated) by them he will be consecrated on the morrow.

<span id="v5_3_3_1414"><sup><small>5:3:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  They are double-named, for a coupling means strength: ‘May the strong quicken (him),’ thus he thinks, and therefore they are double-named.

<span id="v5_3_3_1515"><sup><small>5:3:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  He now says, ‘Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t.’ And as to why that ceremony is performed here between two offerings [^155],—verily Pra<i>g</i>âpati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which all these creatures were produced,— <span id="p73"><sup><small>[ p. 73 ]</small></sup></span> and so they are even now produced after this one. Thus he places him (the Sacrificer) in the very middle of that Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and quickens him in the middle: this is why that ceremony is performed between two offerings. Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>. he says, ‘Urge for Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t!’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is pronounced.


<span id="v5_3_4"><sup><small>5:3:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_3_4_11"><sup><small>5:3:4:11.</small></sup></span>  He collects (various kinds of) water. The reason why he collects water, is that—water being vigour—he thereby collects vigour, the essence of die waters.

<span id="v5_3_4_22"><sup><small>5:3:4:22.</small></sup></span>  In a vessel of udumbara wood,—the udumbara (ficus glomerata) being sustenance, (that is) food—-for the obtainment of sustenance, food: hence in an udumbara vessel (he mixes the different liquids).

<span id="v5_3_4_33"><sup><small>5:3:4:33.</small></sup></span>  He first takes (water) [^156] from the (river) Sarasvatî, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, i), ‘The gods took honey-sweet water,’—whereby he says, ‘the gods took water full of essence;’—‘sapful, deemed king-quickening,’—by ‘sapful’ he means to say, ‘full of essence;’ and by ‘deemed king-quickening’ he means to say, ‘(water) which is recognised as king-quickening;’—‘wherewith they anointed Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a,’ for therewith they did anoint (sprinkle) Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a;—‘wherewith they guided <span id="p74"><sup><small>[ p. 74 ]</small></sup></span> Indra past his enemies,’ for therewith they indeed guided Indra past the fiends, the Rakshas. Therewith he sprinkles him,—Sarasvatî being (the goddess of) Speech: it is with speech he thereby sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_44"><sup><small>5:3:4:44.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having taken ghee in four ladlings, steps down into the water, and takes the two waves which flow away (in different directions) after an animal or a man has stept (or plunged) into it.

<span id="v5_3_4_55"><sup><small>5:3:4:55.</small></sup></span>  The one which rises in front of him he catches up with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 2), 'Thou art the male's wave, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on me, hail!—Thou art the male's wave, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on N.N.!’

<span id="v5_3_4_66"><sup><small>5:3:4:66.</small></sup></span>  He then catches up that (wave) which rises up behind him with, ‘Thou art the lord of a host of males, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on me, hail!—Thou art the lord of a host of males, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles; for indeed that is the vigour of the water which rises when either beast or man plunges into it: it is with vigour he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_77"><sup><small>5:3:4:77.</small></sup></span>  He then takes flowing (water) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 3), ‘Task-plying ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Task-plying ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles; for with vigour these (waters) flow, whence nothing stops them flowing along: it is <span id="p75"><sup><small>[ p. 75 ]</small></sup></span> with vigour he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_88"><sup><small>5:3:4:88.</small></sup></span>  He then takes such (water) as flows against the stream of the flowing water with, ‘Powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles, for with vigour indeed those (waters) flow against the stream of the flowing ones: it is with vigour he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_99"><sup><small>5:3:4:99.</small></sup></span>  He then takes (water) that flows off (the main current) with, ‘Overflowing waters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Overflowing waters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles. Now that (flow of water), after separating itself from that (main current), comes to be that again [^157]; and so there is in his kingdom even one belonging to some other kingdom, and even that man from another kingdom he absorbs: thus he (the Adhvaryu) bestows abundance upon him (the king), and it is with abundance that he thus consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1010"><sup><small>5:3:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then takes the lord of rivers (sea-water) with, ‘Thou art the lord of waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on me, hail!—Thou art the lord of waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on N.N.!’ <span id="p76"><sup><small>[ p. 76 ]</small></sup></span> With that (water) he sprinkles him; and that lord of rivers (the ocean) being the same as the lord of waters, he thereby makes him (the king) the lord of the people. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1111"><sup><small>5:3:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  He then takes (water from) a whirlpool with, ‘Thou art the offspring of the waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on me, hail!—Thou art the offspring of the waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles. Now the waters enclose the offspring (embryo): he thus makes him the offspring of the people. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1212"><sup><small>5:3:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  Then what standing pool of flowing water there is in a sunny spot, that (water) he takes with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 4), ‘Sun-skinned ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Sun-skinned ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles: it is with lustre he thereby sprinkles him, and makes him sun-skinned. Now it is to Varu<i>n</i>a that those waters belong which, (whilst being part) of flowing water, do not flow: and Varu<i>n</i>a's quickening (sava) is that Râ<i>g</i>asûya: therefore he sprinkles him therewith. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1313"><sup><small>5:3:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then catches such (water) as it rains while the sun shines, with, ‘Lustrous as the sun ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Lustrous as the sun ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With this (water) he sprinkles: it is with lustre he thereby sprinkles him, and lustrous <span id="p77"><sup><small>[ p. 77 ]</small></sup></span> as the sun he thereby makes him. And pure indeed is such water as it rains while the sun shines, for before it has reached this (earth), he catches it: he thus makes him pure thereby. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1414"><sup><small>5:3:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then takes (water) from a pond with, ‘Pleasing ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me!—Pleasing ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles: he thereby makes the people steady and faithful to him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1515"><sup><small>5:3:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  He then draws (water) from a well with, ‘Fold-dwellers ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Fold-dwellers ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With this (water) he sprinkles. He thereby brings (some of) the water which is beyond this (earth), and also (he does so) for the completeness of the waters, this is why he sprinkles him therewith. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1616"><sup><small>5:3:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  He then takes dew-drops [^158] with, ‘Devoted [^159] <span id="p78"><sup><small>[ p. 78 ]</small></sup></span> ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Devoted ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles: it is with food he thereby consecrates him, and food he thereby bestows upon him, For even as this fire burns up (the wood) so does that sun yonder, even in rising, burn up the plants, the food. But those waters coming down, quench that (heat), for if those waters were not to come down, there would be no food left remaining here: it is with food he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1717"><sup><small>5:3:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  He then takes honey with, ‘Most powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Most powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With this (water) he sprinkles, and it is by the essence of the waters and plants that he thereby sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1818"><sup><small>5:3:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  He then takes embryonic (waters) of a calving cow with, ‘Mighty ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Mighty ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles: it is with cattle he thereby consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_1919"><sup><small>5:3:4:1919.</small></sup></span>  He then takes milk with, ‘Man-supporting ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—Man-supporting ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles: <span id="p79"><sup><small>[ p. 79 ]</small></sup></span> it is with cattle he thereby consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_2020"><sup><small>5:3:4:2020.</small></sup></span>  He then takes clarified butter with, ‘All-supporting ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!—All-supporting ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ With that (water) he sprinkles: it is with the essence of cattle he thereby consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_2121"><sup><small>5:3:4:2121.</small></sup></span>  Having then caught up (moist) sun-motes with the hollow of his hands, he mixes them (with the other kinds of water), with, ‘Self-ruling waters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!’ For those sun-motes are indeed self-ruling waters, since they are flowing, as it were, and, not yielding to one another's superiority, keep being now higher now lower: he thus thereby bestows self-ruling power upon him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.

<span id="v5_3_4_2222"><sup><small>5:3:4:2222.</small></sup></span>  These then are seventeen (kinds of) water he brings together, for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: that is why he brings together seventeen kinds of water.

<span id="v5_3_4_2323"><sup><small>5:3:4:2323.</small></sup></span>  Now sixteen kinds of water are those he offers upon; and he offers sixteen oblations: that makes thirty-two. On two of them he does not offer, viz. on the water from the Sarasvatî and on the sun-motes: that makes thirty-four. For three and thirty are the gods, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the thirty-fourth: he thus makes him to be Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures).

<span id="v5_3_4_2424"><sup><small>5:3:4:2424.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he takes (water) each time after offering,—the ghee, to be sure, is a thunderbolt: <span id="p80"><sup><small>[ p. 80 ]</small></sup></span> having won them, one by one, by means of that thunderbolt, the ghee, and made them his own, he takes them.

<span id="v5_3_4_2525"><sup><small>5:3:4:2525.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he does not offer on the (water) from the Sarasvatî,—Sarasvatî, to be sure, is (the goddess of) Speech, and the ghee is a thunderbolt: 'Lest I should injure (the goddess of) Speech! thus (he thinks, and) therefore he does not offer on the water from the Sarasvatî.

<span id="v5_3_4_2626"><sup><small>5:3:4:2626.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he does not offer on the sun-motes: ‘Lest I should offer that oblation in a doubtful way [^160]!’ thus (he thinks, and) therefore he does not offer on the sun-motes.

<span id="v5_3_4_2727"><sup><small>5:3:4:2727.</small></sup></span>  He pours them together into an udumbara vessel with, ‘Let the honey-sweet mix with the honey-sweet!’—‘Let those full of essence mix with those full of essence!’ he thereby says;—‘Winning great power (kshatra) for the Kshatriya!’ in saying this he prays in a covert way for power to the Sacrificer.

<span id="v5_3_4_2828"><sup><small>5:3:4:2828.</small></sup></span>  He deposits them in front of the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's hearth, with, ‘Unimpaired rest ye, the strengthful!’—‘unimpaired by the Rakshas rest ye!’ he thereby says; and by ‘strengthful’ he means to say 'powerful; ‘bestowing great power on the Kshatriya;’—in saying this he prays in an overt way for power to the Sacrificer.


## Footnotes

[^156]: 73:1 This water gathered from an adjacent river and pond, with some admixture of genuine water from the sacred river Sarasvatî-whence the whole water is also called ‘sârasvatya âpa<i>h</i>’—is to be used partly in the place of the ordinary Vasatîvarî water, and partly for the consecration or anointment (sprinkling) of the king. The different kinds of water or liquids are first taken in separate vessels of palâ<i>s</i>a (butea frondosa) wood, and then poured together into the udumbara vessel.

[^157]: 75:1 That is to say, it ultimately flows back and mingles again with the main current.

[^158]: 77:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a explains ‘prushvâ’ by ‘nîhârâ<i>h</i>’ (mist water), the commentators on Kâty. XV, 4, 38, by ‘hoar-frost.’

[^159]: 77:2 It is difficult to see in what sense the author takes vâ<i>s</i>a. While Mahîdhara (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 4) explains it by ‘pleasing’ or ‘desirable’ (u<i>s</i>yante <i>g</i>anai<i>h</i> kâmyanteऽnnanishpattihetutrât); Sâya<i>n</i>a leaves a choice between that meaning (sarvai<i>h</i> kâmyamânâ) and that of ‘obedient, submissive’ (yadvâ va<i>s</i>yâ stha, nîhâro hi nadîpravâhavan manushyâdigatim na pratibadhnâti, ato va<i>s</i>yatvam prushvâ<i>n</i>âm annâdyâtmakatvam upapâdayati; MS. I. O. 657). The St. Petersburg dictionary gives the meaning ‘submissive,’ but leaves it doubtful whether it may not be derived from va<i>s</i>a, ‘fat, grease.’

## FIFTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_3_5_11"><sup><small>5:3:5:11.</small></sup></span>  He consecrates him at the midday Soma-feast. Now Pra<i>g</i>âpati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and whence these creatures have been <span id="p81"><sup><small>[ p. 81 ]</small></sup></span> produced,—and so they are even now produced after this one: he thus places him in the very middle of that Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and consecrates him in the middle.

<span id="v5_3_5_22"><sup><small>5:3:5:22.</small></sup></span>  Before the Mâhendra (cup) has been drawn,—for that Mâhendra cup is Indra's special (nishkevalya) cup, and so is that Nishkevalya Stotra (hymn) and Nishkevalya <i>S</i>astra (recitation); and the Sacrificer is Indra: he thus consecrates him—in his own resting-place. Hence before the Mâhendra (cup) has been drawn,—

<span id="v5_3_5_33"><sup><small>5:3:5:33.</small></sup></span>  He spreads a tiger-skin in front of the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's hearth [^161], with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 5), 'Thou art Soma's beauty.' For because when Soma flowed through Indra he (Indra) thereupon became a tiger, therefore he is Soma's beauty: this is why he says, 'Thou art Soma's splendour;'—‘may my beauty become like unto thine!’ He thus bestows the tiger's beauty on him: therefore he says, ‘May my beauty become like unto thine!’

<span id="v5_3_5_44"><sup><small>5:3:5:44.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the Pârtha oblations. Now P<i>ri</i>thin Vainya was consecrated first of men. He desired that he might appropriate to himself all food. They offered up for him those (oblations), and he appropriated to himself all the food here on earth. They would even call forest beasts to him, saying, ‘Come hither thou (beast) so and so, the king wants to cook thee!’ Thus he appropriated all food here on earth; and verily he appropriates to himself all food for whom that knows this those (oblations) are offered.

<span id="v5_3_5_55"><sup><small>5:3:5:55.</small></sup></span>  There are twelve of them,—for there are <span id="p82"><sup><small>[ p. 82 ]</small></sup></span> twelve months in the year: therefore there are twelve of them.

<span id="v5_3_5_66"><sup><small>5:3:5:66.</small></sup></span>  Six he offers before, and six after, the consecration: he thereby places him in the very middle of that Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and consecrates him in the middle.

<span id="v5_3_5_77"><sup><small>5:3:5:77.</small></sup></span>  Now of those which he offers before the consecration, B<i>ri</i>haspati is the last (recipient), and of those which he offers after the consecration, Indra is the first;—but B<i>ri</i>haspati is priestly dignity (brahma), and Indra is might, vigour: with these two kinds of vigour he thus encloses him on both sides.

<span id="v5_3_5_88"><sup><small>5:3:5:88.</small></sup></span>  Those which he offers before the consecration, he offers (resp.) with, ‘To Agni hail!’—Agni is brightness (te<i>g</i>as): with brightness he thus sprinkles (endows) him;—‘To Soma hail!’—Soma is princely power (kshatra): with princely power he thus sprinkles him;—‘To Savit<i>ri</i> hail!’—Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> he thus consecrates him;—‘To Sarasvatî hail!’—Sarasvatî is Speech: he thus sprinkles him with Speech;—‘To Pûshan hail!’—Pûshan is cattle: with cattle he thus sprinkles him;—‘To B<i>ri</i>haspati hail!’—B<i>ri</i>haspati is priestly dignity: with priestly dignity he thus sprinkles him. These he offers before the consecration: these are called the Agni-named ones.

<span id="v5_3_5_99"><sup><small>5:3:5:99.</small></sup></span>  Those which he offers after the consecration, he offers (resp.) with, ‘To Indra hail!’—Indra is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;—‘To the roar hail!’—roar means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;—'To the noise hail! 'noise means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;—‘To A<i>m</i><i>s</i>a hail!’—A<i>m</i><i>s</i>a is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;—‘To Bhaga hail!’—Bhaga is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles <span id="p83"><sup><small>[ p. 83 ]</small></sup></span> him;—‘To Aryaman hail!’—he thus makes him the friend (aryaman) of everything here. These he offers after the consecration: these are called the Âditya-named [^162] ones.

<span id="v5_3_5_1010"><sup><small>5:3:5:1010.</small></sup></span>  In front of the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's hearth are the (four) consecration vessels in which that consecration water is contained [^163].

<span id="v5_3_5_1111"><sup><small>5:3:5:1111.</small></sup></span>  There is a palâ<i>s</i>a (butea frondosa) one: with (the water of) that (vessel) a Brâhman sprinkles;—the Palâ<i>s</i>a tree is priestly dignity (brahman): it is with priestly dignity that he sprinkles (endows) him.

<span id="v5_3_5_1212"><sup><small>5:3:5:1212.</small></sup></span>  There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: therewith one of his own (kinsmen, or brothers) sprinkles. The udumbara tree means sustenance, (that is) food, and the ‘own’ means sustenance, for as far as a man's own goes, so far he does not hunger: thereby his ‘own’ is sustenance, and therefore one of his own (kinsmen) sprinkles with an udumbara (vessel).

<span id="v5_3_5_1313"><sup><small>5:3:5:1313.</small></sup></span>  There is one made of the foot (stem) of the nyagrodha (ficus indica): therewith a friendly (mitrya) Râ<i>g</i>anya sprinkles: for by its feet [^164] the <span id="p84"><sup><small>[ p. 84 ]</small></sup></span> nyagrodha tree is supported, and by the friend (mitra) the Râ<i>g</i>anya (nobleman or king) is supported: therefore a friendly Râ<i>g</i>anya sprinkles with (the water of a vessel) made of the foot of a nyagrodha.

<span id="v5_3_5_1414"><sup><small>5:3:5:1414.</small></sup></span>  There is an a<i>s</i>vattha (ficus religiosa) one: therewith a Vai<i>s</i>ya sprinkles. Because Indra on that (former) occasion called upon the Maruts staying on the A<i>s</i>vattha tree [^165], therefore a Vai<i>s</i>ya sprinkles with an a<i>s</i>vattha (vessel). These are the consecration vessels.

<span id="v5_3_5_1515"><sup><small>5:3:5:1515.</small></sup></span>  He then prepares two strainers (pavitra), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 6), 'Purifiers ye are, Vish<i>n</i>u's own;'—the significance is the same (as before [^166]). He weaves gold (threads) into them. With them he purifies those consecration waters. As to why he weaves gold (threads) in,—gold is immortal life: that immortal life he lays into these (waters), and hence he weaves gold (threads) in.

<span id="v5_3_5_1616"><sup><small>5:3:5:1616.</small></sup></span>  He purifies with, ‘By the impulse of Savit<i>ri</i> I purify you with a flawless purifier, with the rays of the sun.’ The significance is the same (as before [^167]). ‘Not downfallen thou art, the friend of Speech, born of heat,’—unimpaired by the Rakshas he means to say when he says, ‘not downfallen;’—‘the friend of Speech’—as long as there is water in the vital airs, so long (man) speaks with speech: therefore he says, ‘the friend of Speech.’ <span id="p85"><sup><small>[ p. 85 ]</small></sup></span> 5:3:5:1717\. ‘Born of heat’ he says, for from fire springs smoke, from smoke the cloud, from the cloud rain,—it is from fire that these are produced: hence he says, ‘born of heat.’

<span id="v5_3_5_1818"><sup><small>5:3:5:1818.</small></sup></span>  'Soma's portion thou art;' for when they consecrate him with those (waters), then there is an oblation: therefore he says 'Soma's portion thou art;'—‘Hail, spiriters of kings!’—it is with ‘Hail’ that he thus purifies them.

<span id="v5_3_5_1919"><sup><small>5:3:5:1919.</small></sup></span>  He distributes them over those (consecration) vessels, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 7), ‘Playmates are these glorious waters;’—‘not overbearing’ he means to say, when he says ‘playmates;’ and by ‘these glorious waters’ he means to say ‘the powerful ones;’—‘unimpaired, active, enveloping,’ he thereby means to say ‘ye are unimpaired by the Rakshas;’—‘In the habitations Varu<i>n</i>a hath made a home;’—the habitations are the people (clans): ‘in the people Varu<i>n</i>a has made a support’ he thereby says;—‘he, the child of the waters, in the best of mothers;’—for he who performs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya is indeed the child of the waters: therefore he says, ‘the child of the waters, in the best of mothers.’

<span id="v5_3_5_2020"><sup><small>5:3:5:2020.</small></sup></span>  He then makes him (the king) put on garments. There is that one called târpya [^168]; therein are <span id="p86"><sup><small>[ p. 86 ]</small></sup></span> wrought [^169] all forms of sacrifice: that he makes him put on, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 8), ‘Thou art the inner caul of knighthood (kshatra)!’ He thus causes him to be born from out of what is the inner caul (amnion) of knighthood.

<span id="v5_3_5_2121"><sup><small>5:3:5:2121.</small></sup></span>  He then makes him put on one of undyed wool, with, ‘Thou art the outer caul of knighthood!’ He thus causes him to be born from what is the outer caul (chorion) of knighthood.

<span id="v5_3_5_2222"><sup><small>5:3:5:2222.</small></sup></span>  He then throws over the mantle, with, ‘Thou art the womb of knighthood!’ He thus causes him to be born from what is the womb of knighthood.

<span id="v5_3_5_2323"><sup><small>5:3:5:2323.</small></sup></span>  He then draws the head-band together, and conceals it (tucks it under) in front [^170], with, ‘Thou art the navel of knighthood!’ He thus places him in what is the navel of knighthood.

<span id="v5_3_5_2424"><sup><small>5:3:5:2424.</small></sup></span>  Now some wind it quite round about (the navel) saying, ‘that (band) is his navel, and this navel goes all round.’ But let him not do this, but let him merely tuck it under in front, for this navel is in front. And as to why he makes him put on the garments;—he thereby causes him to be born [^171], <span id="p87"><sup><small>[ p. 87 ]</small></sup></span> thinking, ‘I will anoint him when born:’ that is why he makes him put on the garments.

<span id="v5_3_5_2525"><sup><small>5:3:5:2525.</small></sup></span>  Now some put off those garments [^172], and make him put on again the garment of initiation. But let him not do this; for, the limbs [^173] being his natural vestments, they deprive him of his limbs, of his native bodily form. The garment of initiation belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a. Let him put on one of those same garments: he (the priest) thereby causes him to be furnished with his limbs, his native bodily form. The garment of initiation belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a: he thus saves him from the Varu<i>n</i>ic garment of initiation.

<span id="v5_3_5_2626"><sup><small>5:3:5:2626.</small></sup></span>  And when he enters the bath [^174] they throw it into (the water). This is a congruous [^175] performance. After putting on one of those same garments he comes out (of the bath). Let him give away those (garments) either when the omentum of the barren cow has been offered [^176], or at the completing oblation [^177].

<span id="v5_3_5_2727"><sup><small>5:3:5:2727.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) then strings the bow, with, 'Thou art Indra's V<i>ri</i>tra-killer;' for the bow <span id="p88"><sup><small>[ p. 88 ]</small></sup></span> is indeed a V<i>ri</i>tra-killer, and the Sacrificer is Indra,—he is Indra in a twofold way, both as a Kshatriya, and as Sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's V<i>ri</i>tra-killer.’

<span id="v5_3_5_2828"><sup><small>5:3:5:2828.</small></sup></span>  He then strokes the two arms [^178], with, 'Mitra's thou art,—Varu<i>n</i>a's thou art;' for the bow is within the two arms, and by his two arms the Râ<i>g</i>anya pertains to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a: therefore he says, 'Mitra's thou art, Varu<i>n</i>a's thou art.' He hands it to him, with, ‘May he slay V<i>ri</i>tra by thee!’ whereby he means to say, ‘May he slay by thee his spiteful enemy!’

<span id="v5_3_5_2929"><sup><small>5:3:5:2929.</small></sup></span>  He then hands him three arrows. That first-one by which he pierces on shooting [^179], that is one, that one is this earth, that one is called ‘d<i>ri</i>bâ.’ And the one by which (the enemy) being pierced lies either living or dead, that is the second, that is this air, that is called ‘ru<i>g</i>â.’ And the one with which he misses (his aim) [^180], that is the third, that is yonder sky, that is called ‘kshumâ.’ For these are the three (kinds of) arrows: therefore he hands him three arrows.

<span id="v5_3_5_3030"><sup><small>5:3:5:3030.</small></sup></span>  These he hands to him with, ‘Protect ye him in front [^181]!—Protect ye him from behind!—Protect ye him from the side!—Protect ye <span id="p89"><sup><small>[ p. 89 ]</small></sup></span> him from (all) quarters!’ Thus he makes all the quarters safe from arrows for him. And as to why he hands the bow to him;—this, the bow, truly is the nobleman's strength: it is because he thinks, ‘I will consecrate him when endowed with strength!’ that he hands the weapon to him [^182].

<span id="v5_3_5_3131"><sup><small>5:3:5:3131.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he makes him pronounce the âvid formulas [^183] (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 9), 'In sight, ye mortals! This is mysterious for mysterious is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: he thus announces him to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and this one approves of his consecration; and approved by him he is consecrated.

<span id="v5_3_5_3232"><sup><small>5:3:5:3232.</small></sup></span>  ‘Present is Agni, the house-lord;’—-Agni is the priesthood (brahman); he thus announces him to the priesthood; and it approves of his consecration, and approved by it he is consecrated.

5:3:5:3333 ‘Present is Indra, the far-famed;’—Indra is the nobility: he thus announces him to the nobility; and, it approves of his consecration, and approved by it he is consecrated.

<span id="v5_3_5_3434"><sup><small>5:3:5:3434.</small></sup></span>  ‘Present are Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, the upholders of the law;’—Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus announces him to the out-breathing and in-breathing, and they approve of his consecration, and approved by them he is consecrated.

<span id="v5_3_5_3535"><sup><small>5:3:5:3535.</small></sup></span>  ‘Present is Pûshan, the all-possessing;’ <span id="p90"><sup><small>[ p. 90 ]</small></sup></span> Pûshan is (the lord of) cattle: he thus announces him to the cattle, and they approve of his consecration; and approved by them he is consecrated.

<span id="v5_3_5_3636"><sup><small>5:3:5:3636.</small></sup></span>  ‘Present are Heaven and Earth, the all-propitious;’—he thus announces him to those two, the heaven and the earth, and they approve of his consecration; and approved by them he is consecrated.

Thus to whatever deities he announces him, they approve of his consecration, and approved by them he is consecrated.

## Footnotes

[^126]: 58:1 Each of the two ‘ara<i>n</i>is’ is held for a moment to one of the two fires, which are thereby supposed to become inherent in them till they are ‘churned out’ again for the new offering fire required. For this ‘mounting’ of the fire see part i, p. 396.

[^127]: 58:2 Ratna, jewel, precious thing; whence the eleven offerings described in this section are called ratna-havis, or ratninâ<i>m</i> havî<i>m</i>shi; the recipients of these sacrificial honours, on the part of the newly-consecrated king, being called ratnina<i>h</i>, ‘possessed of the Jewel (offering).’—In the ritual of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us (Taitt. S. I, 8, 9; Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3) the order of the Ratnina<i>h</i>, at whose houses these oblations are performed on successive days, is as follows—1. Brahman priest (a pap to B<i>ri</i>haspati); 2. Râ<i>g</i>anya (a cake of eleven kapâlas to Indra); 3. Consecrated Queen (pap to p. 59 Aditi); 4. The king's favourite wife (pap to Bhaga); 5. A discarded wife (pap to Nir<i>ri</i>ti); 6. Commander of the army (cake of eight kap. to Agni); 7. Sûta (charioteer, Sây.—cake of ten kap. to Varu<i>n</i>a); 8. Grâma<i>n</i>î (cake of seven kap. to Maruts); 9. Kshatt<i>ri</i> (chamberlain, or superintendent of seraglio, Sây.—cake of twelve kap. to Savit<i>ri</i>); 10. Sa<i>m</i>grahît<i>ri</i> (treasurer, Sây.—cake of two kap. to A<i>s</i>vins); 11. Bhâgadugha (collector of taxes, Sây.—pap to Pûshan); 12. Akshavâpa (dyûtakara, superintendent of gambling, Sây.—gavîdhuka pap to Rudra).—Finally the king offers in his own house two cake-oblations (of eleven kapâlas) to Indra Sutra-man (the good protector) and Indra A<i>m</i>homu<i>k</i> (the deliverer from trouble).

[^128]: 59:1 Whence the back of that upper region is white, or bright.

[^129]: 60:1 The exact function of this officer is not clearly defined. Though the term is also used of an ordinary village headman (Patel, Adhikârin, Adigar), this could hardly apply here. Sâya<i>n</i>a, on one passage, indeed explains the term by ‘Grâma<i>m</i> nayati,’ but elsewhere he explains it by ‘Grâmâ<i>n</i>â<i>m</i> netâ;’ and some such meaning it may perhaps have here,—the head of communal administration, either for a district (like one of Manu's lords of a hundred, or a p. 61 thousand villages), or for the whole country. If, however, the headman of a single village be intended (as the coupling of the office with the Maruts might lead one to suppose), he would probably be a hereditary territorial proprietor residing near the place where the inauguration ceremony takes place. Cf. [V, 4, 4, 18](../Book_3_5_4#v5_4_4_18); and Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, p. 171.

[^130]: 62:1 Savyash<i>th</i>ri (otherwise savyesh<i>th</i><i>ri</i>, savyesh<i>th</i>a;—savyastha, Kâ<i>n</i>va rec.) is explained by the commentaries as a synonym of sârathi, charioteer (with which it is compounded in savyesh<i>th</i>asârathî, Taitt. Br. I, 7, 9, 1, where Sâya<i>n</i>a makes them the two charioteers standing on the left and right side of the warrior), but it seems more probable that the former terms refer to the warrior (παραβάτης) himself (as savyash<i>th</i>â, Atharva-veda VIII, 8, 23, undoubtedly does), who stands on the left side of the driver (sârathi, ἡνίοχος); the Change of meaning being perhaps due to caste scruples about so close an association between the Kshatriya warrior and his <i>S</i>ûdra servant, as is implied in this and other passages. (Cf. V, 3, 2, 2 with note.)—On Taitt. S. I, 8, 9, Sâya<i>n</i>a explains sa<i>m</i>grahît<i>ri</i> as the treasurer (dhanasa<i>m</i>grahakartâ ko<i>s</i>âdhyaksha<i>h</i>), but on I, 8, 16 optionally as treasurer or charioteer; while the Sûta is I, 8, 9 identified by him with the charioteer (sârathi). It is more probable, however, that at the time of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a the Sûta occupied much the same position as that assigned to him in the epics, viz. that of court-bard and chronicler. The connection of the sa<i>m</i>grahît<i>ri</i> with the A<i>s</i>vins can also scarcely be said to favour the interpretation of the term proposed by Sâya<i>n</i>a (who, moreover, is himself compelled, on Taitt. S. I, 8, 15; Taitt. Br. I, 7, 10, 6, to take it in the sense of charioteer).

[^131]: 63:1 The meaning ‘tax-gatherer, collector of tithes (or rather, of the sixth part of produce)’ assigned to the term by Sâya<i>n</i>a, both here, and on Taitt. S. I, 8, 9, might seem the more natural one, considering the etymology of the term. See, however, the explanation given of it in our Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 1, 2, 17:—‘Pûshan is bhâgadugha (distributor of portions) to the gods, who places with his hands the food before them.’ This clearly is Homer's δαιτρός, Od. I, 141-2:

δαιτρὸς δὲ κρειῶ πίνακας παρέθηκεν ἀείρας
παντοίων, παρὰ δέ σφι τίθει χρύσεια κύπελλα

[^132]: 63:2 See [V, 2, 5, 8](../Book_3_5_2#v5_2_5_8).

[^133]: 63:3 ‘The thrower, or keeper, of the dice,’ according to Sâya<i>n</i>a. At V, 4, 4, 6 the verb â-vap is used of the throwing the dice into the hand of the player; and it is perhaps that function of the keeper of the dice which is meant to be expressed by the term (‘der Zuwerfer der Würfel’).

[^134]: 63:4 Literally, the cutter up of cows, the (beef-) butcher. But according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, this official was the constant companion of his master in the chase.

[^135]: 64:1 Or, a dice-box, as ‘akshâvapanam’ is explained by some commentaries.—akshâ upyanteऽsminn ity akshâvapanam aksha(?akshadyûta-)sthânâvapanapâtram, Sây.

[^136]: 64:2 Or, fastened with a hair-chain (romasra<i>g</i>â prabaddham, Sây.).

[^137]: 64:3 That is to say, the knife and the dice-board are the objects those two officials have chiefly to do with.

[^138]: 65:1 According to the commentary on Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XV, 3, 35 she has to betake herself to a Brahman's house, where the king has no power.

[^139]: 65:2 According to Rig-veda V, 40, 5-9 (cf. <i>S</i>at. Br. IV, 3, 4, 23 p. 66 with note) it was Atri who restored the light of the sun. Professor Ludwig (Bohemian Academy of Sciences, Sitzungsber., May, 1885) has tried to prove that solar eclipses (partly available for chronological purposes) are referred to in this and some other passages of the hymns. Compare also Professor Whitney's remarks thereon, Proceedings of Am. Or. Soc., Oct. 1885, p. xvii.

[^140]: 66:1 That is, some of those officials of his to whom the ratna-havis were offered; Sâya<i>n</i>a specifying ‘the Commander of the army and others’ as <i>S</i>ûdras; and the ‘Huntsman and others’ as of whatsoever (low) caste.

[^141]: 66:2 According to the Taittirîya ritualists this double oblation forms part of the dîkshâ, or initiation ceremony (V, 3, 3, 1). See Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 108.

[^142]: 67:1 That is, produced in the leathern bottle without further direct human agency, and by the mere motion of the cart.

[^143]: 68:1 That is, by the steam rising from the B<i>ri</i>haspati pap in the bottom vessel.

[^144]: 68:2 The Abhishe<i>k</i>anîya (or Abhisheka, literally ‘the sprinkling’), the Consecration ceremony (corresponding to the Anointment of modern times), requires for its performance five days, viz. one dîkshâ (initiation ceremony), three upasads, and one sutyâ or Soma-day, the particular form of Soma-sacrifice being the Ukthya (part ii, p. 325, note 2). The Dîkshâ is performed immediately after the expiration of the dark fortnight following the full-moon of Phalgunî, that is to say, on the first day of <i>K</i>aitra (about the middle of March).—According to Katy. XV, 3, 47 both the Abhishe<i>k</i>anîya and Da<i>s</i>apeya require special offering-places, the latter being north of the former. Cf. note on [V, 4, 5, 13](../Book_3_5_4#v5_4_5_13).—As regards p. 69 the chants (stotra) of the Consecration ceremony, the Pavamâna-stotras are chanted in the thirty-twofold, the Â<i>g</i>ya-stotras in the fifteenfold, the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotras in the seventeenfold, and the Agnish<i>t</i>oma-sâman and Uktha-stotras in the twenty-onefold mode of chanting (stoma). Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>. Br, 18, 10, 9. The Bahishpavamâna is specially constructed so as to consist of the following parts,—Sâma-veda II, 978-80; further six so-called sambhâryâ verses further II, 125-27; II, 4-6; II, 431-3; II, 128-30; II, 555-59; II, 7-9; II, 981-83; see Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>. Br. 18, 8, 7 seq.—The Taittirîya ritual (Taitt. Br. I, 8, 7 seq.), on the other hand, prescribes for the Pavamâna-stotras, the thirty-four-versed stoma, commencing the Bahishpavamâna by II, 920; II, 431, &c.

[^145]: 69:1 This is the ordinary Pa<i>s</i>u-purodâ<i>s</i>a, or cake of animal (offering). See part ii, p. 199, note 2 (where read Agni and Soma. instead of Indra and Agni).

[^146]: 69:2 That is, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, rice which has sprung up again and ripens very rapidly. Taitt. S. I, 8, 10 has ‘â<i>s</i>u’ instead, for which see [next paragraph](../Book_3_5_3#v5_3_3_4).

[^147]: 69:3 Or, consecrated (sû).

[^148]: 69:4 That is, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, rice ripening in sixty days. The Taitt. S. prescribes a cake of black rice for Agni.

[^149]: 70:1 B<i>ri</i>haspati Vâkpati (lord of speech), according to the Black Ya<i>g</i>us, where the order of the ‘Divine Quickeners’ is moreover somewhat different.

[^150]: 70:2 ? Or cooked by the Brahman, that is by Brâhmans, when living the life of hermits or ascetics.

[^151]: 70:3 The Taitt. S. prescribes a cake prepared of large rice (mahâvrîhi).

[^152]: 71:1 The Taitt. S. and Br. read ‘âmba’ instead, ‘a kind of grain,’ according to Sâya<i>n</i>a.

[^153]: 71:2 Or, perhaps, ‘on the part of the quickeners (rulers, savânâm).’

[^154]: 72:1 Here the name of the people, e. g. ‘O ye Kurus, O ye Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âlas!’ is inserted. The Taitt. S. reads, ‘O ye Bharatâ<i>h</i>.’

[^155]: 72:2 That is to say, the oblations to the ‘Divine Quickeners,’ which were inserted between the chief oblation of the (Agnîshomîya) pa<i>s</i>upurodâ<i>s</i>a and the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of it; see above, [parag. 10](../Book_3_5_3#v5_3_3_10).

[^161]: 81:1 Viz. before the ‘waters’ deposited there, according to [V, 3, 4, 28](../Book_3_5_3#v5_3_4_28).

[^162]: 83:1 Viz. because three of the recipients of these libations—A<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, Bhaga and Aryaman—belong to the deities called Âdityas, or sons of Aditi.

[^163]: 83:2 The water in the Udumbara vessel is now distributed into these four (smaller) vessels.

[^164]: 83:3 That is, by its pendant branches. It is well known that the ficus indica, or banyan-tree, as it is ordinarily called, has the habit of bending its branches down to the ground, which then strike root and develop new secondary trunks, so that a single tree may in course of time form a large grove. Hence the name here used for the tree (nyag-rodha, the downward-growing one). ‘A family tends to multiply families around it, till it becomes the centre of a tribe, just as the banyan tends to surround itself with a forest of its own offspring.’ Maclennan, Primitive Marriage, p. 269.

[^165]: 84:1 See above, [p. 34](../Book_3_5_2#p34), note [1](../Book_3_5_2#fn80). The Maruts are constantly identified with the Vi<i>s</i>, or people (peasants, &c.) generally, whilst Indra is taken as the divine representative of the ruling class (the king and nobleman).

[^166]: 84:2 See I, 1, 3, 1 (part i, p. 19).

[^167]: 84:3 See I, 1, 3, 6 (part i, p. 21).

[^168]: 85:1 This is variously explained, by Kâtyâyana and Sâya<i>n</i>a, as a linen one, or simply one soaked in ghee, or a tripâ<i>n</i>a one—i.e. one made of tripar<i>n</i>a plants, or a thrice saturated one (with ghee)—or one woven out of materials derived from the t<i>ri</i>pâ plant. It is quite evident that they did not exactly know what to make of it. Indeed, it would almost seem as if the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a himself was already doubtful as to the meaning of the term. Goldstücker (s.v. abhishe<i>k</i>anîya) perhaps rightly takes it to mean a silk under-garment.

[^169]: 86:1 According to the commentators, figures of sacrificial spoons, cups, &c., are sewn in by means of a needle.

[^170]: 86:2 The commentators do not seem to be quite in accord in regard to this particular item of the ceremonial. The most natural explanation, however, seems to be this: the head-band (turban, ush<i>n</i>îsha) is wound (? once) round the head and tied behind; the ends being then drawn over the shoulders so as to hang down from the neck in the manner of a brahmanical cord (or like the ribbon of an order); and being finally tucked in under the mantle somewhere near the navel.

[^171]: 86:3 Viz. inasmuch as the garments are intended to symbolically represent the vestures of the embryo and stages of birth.

[^172]: 87:1 This change of garments takes place optionally when the Mâhendra libation is about to be offered. Katy. XV, 5, 16; 7, 23-26.

[^173]: 87:2 That is, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, the skin, &c.

[^174]: 87:3 That is, at the end of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya. In case of the change of garments before the Mâhendra libation, the king keeps on the initiation garment in entering and coming out of the bath. This paragraph is of course put in here by anticipation, merely in order to state all that relates to the garments.

[^175]: 87:4 Viz. inasmuch as it is in accordance with what is done at an ordinary Soma-sacrifice, at the end of which the Sacrificer and his wife enter the bath and come forth with fresh garments. See part ii, p. 385. In the present case the king is to enter the bath clothed in one of those three garments, and in coming out he is to put on another of them.

[^176]: 87:5 See part ii, pp. 391-2.

[^177]: 87:6 For the Udavasânîyâ-ish<i>t</i>i, see ib. p. 389.

[^178]: 88:1 Viz. the arms of the king, as it would seem, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a; but the arms (or ends) of the bow, according to Karka and Mahîdhara.

[^179]: 88:2 Literally, on fixing (the arrow on the string); or perhaps, on hitting (the enemy).

[^180]: 88:3 Sâya<i>n</i>a takes apa-râdhnoti in the sense of ‘he hurts (or hits)’ the enemy. In the Kâ<i>n</i>va text (Grantha MS.) the three arrows are called ru<i>g</i>â, d<i>ri</i>vâ, and kshupâ resp.

[^181]: 88:4 Or perhaps,—whilst (he is) moving forward,—whilst moving backward,—whilst moving sideways.

[^182]: 89:1 For a sham fight with arrows forming part of the ceremony in the Black Ya<i>g</i>us ritual, see [p. 100](../Book_3_5_4#p100). note [1](../Book_3_5_4#fn199).

[^183]: 89:2 That is, as would seem, the formulas of information (or perhaps of announcement, introduction); the first of these formulas beginning with âvis (in sight), the others with the participle âvitta, i.e. ‘obtained, present;’ Sâya<i>n</i>a and Mahîdhara, however, taking it in the sense of ‘informed,’—a meaning which, indeed, the word may perhaps have been intended to convey in these formulas.
