## FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_4_1_11"><sup><small>5:4:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He puts a piece of copper [^184] into the mouth of a long-haired man, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 10), ‘Removed by sacrifice are the mordacious.’ For verily he who performs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya escapes all kinds of death, all murderous blows, and old age alone is his death: hence whatever kind of death, whatever murderous blow there is, past that he now guides him, as past the mordacious ones.

<span id="v5_4_1_22"><sup><small>5:4:1:22.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it is of a long-haired man,—such a long-haired man is neither woman nor man; for being a male, he is not a woman, and being longhaired (a eunuch), he is not a man. And copper (or bronze) is neither iron nor gold; and those mordacious ones (snakes) are neither worms nor non-worms. And as to its being copper,—reddish <span id="p91"><sup><small>[ p. 91 ]</small></sup></span> to be sure are mordacious ones: therefore (he throws it in the face) of a long-haired man.

<span id="v5_4_1_33"><sup><small>5:4:1:33.</small></sup></span>  He then makes him ascend the regions, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 10-14), ‘Ascend thou the East! May the Gâyatrî (metre) protect thee, the Rathantara-sâman, the threefold stoma, the spring season, the Priesthood, that precious treasure!’

<span id="v5_4_1_44"><sup><small>5:4:1:44.</small></sup></span>  ‘Ascend thou the South! May the Trish<i>t</i>ubh protect thee, the B<i>ri</i>hat-sâman, the fifteenfold stoma, the summer season, the Knighthood, that precious treasure!’

<span id="v5_4_1_55"><sup><small>5:4:1:55.</small></sup></span>  ‘Ascend thou the West! May the <i>G</i>agatî protect thee, the Vairûpa-sâman, the seventeenfold stoma, the rainy season, the Peasantry, that precious treasure!’

<span id="v5_4_1_66"><sup><small>5:4:1:66.</small></sup></span>  ‘Ascend thou the North! May the Anush<i>t</i>ubh protect thee, the Vairâ<i>g</i>a-sâman, the twenty-onefold stoma, the autumn season, fruit, that precious treasure!’

<span id="v5_4_1_77"><sup><small>5:4:1:77.</small></sup></span>  ‘Ascend thou the upper region! May the Paṅkti protect thee, the Sâkvara and Raivata-sâmans, the thrice-ninefold and the three and thirtyfold stomas, the winter and dewy season, spiritual lustre, that precious treasure!’

<span id="v5_4_1_88"><sup><small>5:4:1:88.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he makes him ascend the quarters,—that is a form of the seasons: it is the seasons, the year, that he thereby makes him ascend; and having ascended the seasons, the year, he is high, high above everything here, and everything here is below him.

<span id="v5_4_1_99"><sup><small>5:4:1:99.</small></sup></span>  On the hind part of the tiger's skin [^185] a piece of <span id="p92"><sup><small>[ p. 92 ]</small></sup></span> lead is laid down. He kicks it off with his foot, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 14), 'Kicked off is Namu<i>k</i>i's head!' Now there was once an Âsura, Namu<i>k</i>i by name. Indra knocked him down, and trod with his foot upon him. And in that he, thus trodden upon, bulged out, that (is the origin of) a rupture. He tore off his head with his foot, and therefrom sprang a goblin (Rakshas). That one kept calling out to him, ‘Whither art thou going? Where wilt thou rid thyself of me?’

<span id="v5_4_1_1010"><sup><small>5:4:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  He beat it off with (a disk of) lead: hence lead is soft, for it has lost its spring, as it beat off (the goblin) with all its might. Hence also, while being like gold, it is not worth anything; for it has lost its spring, as it beat off (the goblin) with all its might. And so, indeed, he (Indra) thereby beat off the fiends, the Rakshas; and in like manner this one (the king) thereby beats off the fiends, the Rakshas.

<span id="v5_4_1_1111"><sup><small>5:4:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  He then makes him step upon the tiger's skin, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 15), 'Thou art Soma's beauty;'—For because when Soma flowed through Indra, he (Indra) thereupon became a tiger, and therefore he is Soma's beauty: this is why he says, 'Thou art Soma's beauty;'—‘May my beauty be like unto thine!’—The tiger's beauty he thereby bestows upon him: therefore he says, ‘May my beauty be like unto thine!’

<span id="v5_4_1_1212"><sup><small>5:4:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  Below (the king's foot) he throws a (small) gold plate, with, ‘Save (him) from death!’—Gold is immortal life: he thus takes his stand on immortal life.

<span id="v5_4_1_1313"><sup><small>5:4:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  Then there is (another) gold plate, perforated either with a hundred, or with nine, holes. If with <span id="p93"><sup><small>[ p. 93 ]</small></sup></span> a hundred holes,—man here lives up to a hundred (years), and has a hundred energies, a hundred powers; therefore it is perforated with a hundred holes. And if with nine holes,—there are in man those nine vital airs: therefore it is perforated with nine holes.

<span id="v5_4_1_1414"><sup><small>5:4:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  That (gold plate) he lays upon his head, with, ‘Might thou art, victory thou art, immortality thou art!’ Gold being immortal life, he thus lays immortal life into him. And as to why there are gold plates on both sides,—gold being immortal life,—he thus encloses him on both sides with immortal life: this is why there are gold plates on both sides.

<span id="v5_4_1_1515"><sup><small>5:4:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  He then lifts up his arms, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 16 [^186]), ‘Golden-bodied, ye two lords rise like the sun: mount ye the chariot, O Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, and thence behold Aditi and Diti!’ Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a verily are the two arms, and the chariot (-seat) is the man: therefore he says, ‘Mount ye the chariot, O Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a!’—‘thence behold Aditi and Diti!’ By this he means to say, ‘See ye your own (property) and that of others’’

<span id="v5_4_1_1616"><sup><small>5:4:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  Let him not lift up (the king's arms) with that one, but let him rather lift them up with, ‘Thou art Mitra, thou art Varu<i>n</i>a;’ for Mitra-Varu<i>n</i>a are the two arms, and by his arms the Râ<i>g</i>anya belongs to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a: let him therefore lift up his arms with, ‘Thou art Mitra, thou art Varu<i>n</i>a.’ <span id="p94"><sup><small>[ p. 94 ]</small></sup></span> 5:4:1:1717\. And as to why he anoints him (standing) with upstretched arms;—those arms in truth are the Râ<i>g</i>anya's power, and power also is that collected essence of the waters wherewith he now anoints him: ‘Lest that power, the collected essence of the waters, weigh down (paralyze) this power of mine, the arms,’ thus he thinks, and therefore he anoints him (standing) with upstretched arms.


<span id="v5_4_2"><sup><small>5:4:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_4_2_11"><sup><small>5:4:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He (the king) is anointed (sprinkled) whilst standing with his face turned towards the east. A Brâhman—either the Adhvaryu, or he who is his (the king's) court chaplain—sprinkles him in front, from behind;—

<span id="v5_4_2_22"><sup><small>5:4:2:22.</small></sup></span>  With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 17), 'With Soma's glory I sprinkle thee,'—‘with vigour’ he thereby says; 'With Agni's glow . . . [^187],'—‘with vigour’ he thereby says;—'With Sûrya's splendour . . .,'—‘with vigour’ he thereby says;—'With Indra's energy. . .,'—‘with vigour’ he thereby says;—‘Be thou the chieftain of chiefs!’—‘be thou the supreme king of kings’ he thereby says;—‘Guard (him) [^188] against darts!’—darts meaning arrows, it is past murder by arrows that he thus guides him: therefore he says, ‘guard him against darts!’

<span id="v5_4_2_33"><sup><small>5:4:2:33.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 18\] ‘Quicken him, O gods, to <span id="p95"><sup><small>[ p. 95 ]</small></sup></span> be unrivalled!’—he thereby says, ‘Quicken him, O gods, so as to be without an enemy;’—‘For great chiefdom, for great lordship!’—in this there is nothing obscure;—‘For man-rule!’—‘for the ruling of men’ he thereby says;—'For Indra's lordly sway!'—‘for power’ he means to say, when he says, 'for Indra's lordly sway!'—‘Him, the son of such and such (a man), the son of such and such (a woman),’—whatever be his parentage regarding that he says this;—‘of such and such a people’—that is to say, of the people whose king he is;—‘This man, O ye (people), is your king, Soma is the king of us Brahmans!’—he thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the king); the Brâhman alone he excepts: therefore the Brâhman is not to be fed upon, for he has Soma for his king [^189].

<span id="v5_4_2_44"><sup><small>5:4:2:44.</small></sup></span>  He (the king) then rubs the sprinkled water <span id="p96"><sup><small>[ p. 96 ]</small></sup></span> over himself with the horn of a black antelope; for that collected essence of the waters wherewith he now anoints him means vigour: ‘May this vigour of mine spread through my whole self,’ thus he thinks, and therefore he rubs it all over himself.

<span id="v5_4_2_55"><sup><small>5:4:2:55.</small></sup></span>  He rubs it over himself, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 19), Forth from the back of the mountain, of the bull,'—even as the mountain stands out here, even as the bull stands out beyond the cattle, so does he who performs the Râ<i>g</i>asûya stand out beyond everything here, and everything here is below him: therefore he says, ‘Forth from the back of the mountain, of the bull,’—‘The ships keep moving, the self-pouring; they, the upwards bent, have turned back downwards, flowing after the dragon of the deep [^190].’

<span id="v5_4_2_66"><sup><small>5:4:2:66.</small></sup></span>  He then makes him step the (three) Vish<i>n</i>u-steps within (the extent of) the tiger's skin, with, 'Vish<i>n</i>u's outstepping thou art! Vish<i>n</i>u's outstep thou art! Vish<i>n</i>u's step thou art!' Now Vish<i>n</i>u's outstepping (vikrama<i>n</i>a), Vish<i>n</i>u's outstep (vikrânta), and Vish<i>n</i>u's step (krânta) [^191] are these (three) worlds: thus having ascended these worlds, he is high above everything here, and everything here is below him.

<span id="v5_4_2_77"><sup><small>5:4:2:77.</small></sup></span>  He then pours the remainders (of the water) together into the Brâhman's vessel: he thereby makes the Brâhman an object of respect after the king, whence the Brâhman is an object of respect after the king. <span id="p97"><sup><small>[ p. 97 ]</small></sup></span> 5:4:2:88\. And to him who is his (the king's) dearest son, he hands that vessel, thinking, ‘May this son of mine perpetuate this vigour of mine!’

<span id="v5_4_2_99"><sup><small>5:4:2:99.</small></sup></span>  He then returns to the Gârhapatya fire, (his son) holding on to him behind, and offers, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 20), ‘O Pra<i>g</i>âpati, than thee none other hath encompassed all these forms: for whatsoever object we sacrifice, let that accrue unto us!—This one is the father of N.N.!’—him who is the son, he makes the father, and him who is the father, he makes the son [^192]: he thereby links together the vigour of both of them.—‘N.N. is the father of this one!’ him who is the father, he makes the father, and him who is the son, he makes the son: after linking together the vigour of these two, he puts it again in the proper way,—‘May we be the lords of riches, hail!’—this is the blessing of that ceremony a blessing he thereby invokes.

<span id="v5_4_2_1010"><sup><small>5:4:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  And any residue that is left over, he offers in the Âgnîdhrîya; for redundant is that residue, and redundant also is the Âgnîdhrîya,—in the Gârhapatya they cook the oblations, and in the Âhavanîya they offer, but that one is redundant: thus he puts the redundant to the redundant. He offers it on the north part (of the hearth), for that is the region of that god (Rudra): hence he offers it on the north <span id="p98"><sup><small>[ p. 98 ]</small></sup></span> part. He offers with, ‘O Rudra, whatever potent [1](Book_3_5_4#fn193), highest name is thine, therein thou art an offering, thou art a home-offering, hail!’


<span id="v5_4_3"><sup><small>5:4:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_4_3_11"><sup><small>5:4:3:11.</small></sup></span>  North of the Âhavanîya he places a hundred, or more than a hundred, cows of that relative of his. The reason why he does so is this:

<span id="v5_4_3_22"><sup><small>5:4:3:22.</small></sup></span>  When Varu<i>n</i>a was consecrated, his energy, his vigour departed from him. Probably [^194] that collected essence (life-sap) of the waters wherewith they were sprinkling him, drove out his energy, his vigour. He found it in the cattle, and because he found it in them, therefore cattle are an object of respect. And having found it in the cattle, he again took to himself his energy, his vigour. And in like manner this one;—that energy does not indeed depart from him, but he does it (thinking), 'This Râ<i>g</i>asûya is Varu<i>n</i>a's consecration, and Varu<i>n</i>a did so.’

<span id="v5_4_3_33"><sup><small>5:4:3:33.</small></sup></span>  He takes down the chariot (from the stand [^195]); for whatever turns away from the warrior (râ<i>g</i>anya) that he overtakes with his chariot: for this reason he takes down the chariot.

<span id="v5_4_3_44"><sup><small>5:4:3:44.</small></sup></span>  He takes it down with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 21), 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt!' The chariot is indeed a thunderbolt; and the Sacrificer is Indra;—he is Indra for a twofold reason, namely because he is a <span id="p99"><sup><small>[ p. 99 ]</small></sup></span> Kshatriya, and because he is a Sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art.’

<span id="v5_4_3_55"><sup><small>5:4:3:55.</small></sup></span>  Having turned it (so as to stand) inside the Vedi, he yokes it with, ‘I yoke thee by the direction of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, the directors [^196];’ for Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a are the two arms, and by his arms the Râ<i>g</i>anya belongs to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a that is why he says, ‘I yoke thee by direction of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, the directors.’

<span id="v5_4_3_66"><sup><small>5:4:3:66.</small></sup></span>  He yokes it with four (horses). He passes along by the same way as that on which the dakshi<i>n</i>âs [^197] go,—behind the Sadas, and in front of the hall. He stops it behind the <i>k</i>âtvâla, and in front of the Âgnîdhra.

<span id="v5_4_3_77"><sup><small>5:4:3:77.</small></sup></span>  He mounts it with, ‘For unfeebleness (I mount) thee, for svadhâ [^198] (I mount) thee!’—by ‘for unfeebleness thee’ he means to say, ‘for a state free from afflictions (I mount) thee;’ by ‘for svadhâ thee’ he means to say, ‘for life-sap (I mount) thee;’—‘I, the unharmed Ar<i>g</i>una!’ Now Indra is called Ar<i>g</i>una, which is his mystic name; and this (king) is Indra for a twofold reason, namely because he is a Kshatriya, and because he is a Sacrificer: therefore he says, ‘the unharmed Ar<i>g</i>una.’

<span id="v5_4_3_88"><sup><small>5:4:3:88.</small></sup></span>  He then goads on the right yoke-horse, with, ‘Conquer thou by the impulse of the Maruts!’ For the Maruts are the clansmen, and it is by his <span id="p100"><sup><small>[ p. 100 ]</small></sup></span> clan that the chieftain wins what he desires to win: therefore he says, ‘Conquer thou by the impulse of the Maruts!’

<span id="v5_4_3_99"><sup><small>5:4:3:99.</small></sup></span>  He then stops (the chariot) in the midst of the cows [^199], with, ‘May we obtain by the mind!’ For it is by the mind that everything here (that is obtained) is obtained; and by the mind therefore he now obtains everything: therefore he says, ‘May we obtain by the mind!’

<span id="v5_4_3_1010"><sup><small>5:4:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then touches a cow with the end of the bow, with, ‘Together with energy!’—energy means vigour, kine: it is energy, vigour, he thereby takes to himself. And he adds, ‘I overpower them, I seize them!’

<span id="v5_4_3_1111"><sup><small>5:4:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  Now as to why he stops amidst the cows of his relative,—whatever is tending away from a man, be it either fame, or anything else, that passes over to his relative foremost of all;—that energy, or vigour, he now takes again from his relative to himself: that is why he stops amidst the cows of his relative.

<span id="v5_4_3_1212"><sup><small>5:4:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  In return he presents to him just as many (cows) [^200], or more. For assuredly he, the Sacrificer, <span id="p101"><sup><small>[ p. 101 ]</small></sup></span> is not capable of a cruel deed; but cruelly indeed he acts when he says, ‘I overpower them, I seize them;’ and thus that is done by him without cruelty: this is why, in return, he presents to him just as many (cows) or more.

<span id="v5_4_3_1313"><sup><small>5:4:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then pulls the right-side (horses, or reins). He passes along on the same way as that on which the dakshi<i>n</i>â (cows) go,—in front of the sacrificial post, and along the south of the Vedi. Behind the Sadas, and in front of the hall, he stops that (car).

<span id="v5_4_3_1414"><sup><small>5:4:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 22\], ‘Lest, O Indra, overpowerer of the mighty, we be wanting thee, heedless through ungodliness,—mount thou, O divine wielder of the thunderbolt, the chariot which thou restrainest (as well as its) well-horsed reins [^201].’ With this (verse) he stops (the chariot);—reins (ra<i>s</i>mi) means bridle (abhî<i>s</i>u): therefore he says, ‘Thou restrainest the well-horsed reins [^202]???.’ Thereupon he offers the (four oblations) relating to the unyoking of the chariot. ‘Well-pleased the chariot shall be when unyoked,’ he thinks, and therefore he offers the (oblations) relating to the unyoking of the chariot.

<span id="v5_4_3_1515"><sup><small>5:4:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 23), ‘To Agni, the House-lord, hail!’ He thereby pleases the part of the chariot relating to Agni; and it is the shoulder-pieces of the chariot that relate to Agni it is the shoulder-pieces (of the yoke) he thereby pleases. And the house-lord's position means prosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, for <span id="p102"><sup><small>[ p. 102 ]</small></sup></span> the prosperity, the house-lordship, of that his kingship is thereby rendered free (unopposed).

<span id="v5_4_3_1616"><sup><small>5:4:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  ‘To Soma, the wood-lord (tree), hail!’ There are two kinds of (objects) coming from trees, the wheels of chariots and waggons, for both of these he thereby ensures safety. And the wood-lord (tree) being Soma,—whatever part of the chariot comes from the tree, that he thereby pleases. Now the parts of the chariot coming from trees are the wooden pieces of the chariot: hence it is the wooden pieces he thereby pleases. And Soma being the nobility, it is over the nobility that his kingship is thereby rendered free.

<span id="v5_4_3_1717"><sup><small>5:4:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  ‘To the strength of the Maruts, hail!’ He thereby pleases the part of the chariot belonging to the Maruts,—there are four horses, the chariot the fifth, and the warrior (chariot-fighter) and charioteer two—these are seven, and the host of the Maruts consists of (troops of) seven each: he thereby pleases the whole chariot; and the Maruts being the peasants, it is over the peasantry that his kingship is thereby rendered free.

<span id="v5_4_3_1818"><sup><small>5:4:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  'To Indra's energy, hail!' He thereby pleases the part of the chariot that belongs to Indra. Now the warrior relates to Indra, and it is the warrior he thereby pleases. And Indra's energy (indriya) means the vigour in Indra [^203]: it is in regard to energy, vigour, that his kingship is thereby rendered free.

<span id="v5_4_3_1919"><sup><small>5:4:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  He then puts on shoes of boar's skin. Now the gods once put a pot of ghee on the fire. Therefrom a boar was produced: hence the boar is fat, <span id="p103"><sup><small>[ p. 103 ]</small></sup></span> for it was produced from ghee. Hence also cows readily take to a boar: it is indeed their own essence (life-sap, blood) they are readily taking to. Thus he firmly establishes himself in the essence of the cattle: therefore he puts on shoes of boar's skin.

<span id="v5_4_3_2020"><sup><small>5:4:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  Looking down on this (earth) he then mutters, ‘O mother Earth, injure me not, nor I thee!’ For the Earth was once afraid of Varu<i>n</i>a, when he had been consecrated, thinking, ‘Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!’ And Varu<i>n</i>a also was afraid of the Earth, thinking, ‘I fear lest she may shake me off!’ Hence by that (formula) he entered into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother.

<span id="v5_4_3_2121"><sup><small>5:4:3:2121.</small></sup></span>  Now this Râ<i>g</i>asûya is Varu<i>n</i>a's consecration; and the Earth is afraid of him, thinking, ‘Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!’ And he also is afraid of her, thinking, ‘I fear lest she may shake me off.’ Hence he thereby enters into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother: therefore he mutters thus.

<span id="v5_4_3_2222"><sup><small>5:4:3:2222.</small></sup></span>  He steps down (from the chariot), muttering this ati<i>kh</i>andas verse (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 24; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 40, 5), ‘The swan dwelling in the light, the Vasu dwelling in the air, the priest seated on the altar, the guest dwelling in the retreat (house),—the man-dwelling, the space-dwelling [^204], the law-dwelling, the sphere-dwelling, the water-born, <span id="p104"><sup><small>[ p. 104 ]</small></sup></span> cow-born, law-born, rock-born (is) the great law.’ For that ati<i>kh</i>andas (or excessive metre) comprises all the metres: thus evil does not descend along with him.

<span id="v5_4_3_2323"><sup><small>5:4:3:2323.</small></sup></span>  Let not the charioteer get down along with (or, after) him, lest he should descend on the same world on which the anointed (king) has just descended. They put him up, along with the chariot, on the car-stand. Thence he leaps down: thus he does not descend on the same world on which the anointed has just descended [^205].

<span id="v5_4_3_2424"><sup><small>5:4:3:2424.</small></sup></span>  North of the Âhavanîya is the original fire, taken up (from the hearth [^206]). Behind the right hind-wheel of the cart-stand he fastens two round <i>s</i>atamânas [^207].

<span id="v5_4_3_2525"><sup><small>5:4:3:2525.</small></sup></span>  He then hides an udumbara (ficus glomerata) branch (in the wheel-track). He touches one of those two (plates), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 25), ‘So great thou art, life thou art: bestow life upon me! A yoke-mate thou art, lustre thou art: bestow lustre upon me!’ He thereby takes life and lustre to himself.

<span id="v5_4_3_2626"><sup><small>5:4:3:2626.</small></sup></span>  He then touches the udumbara branch, with, ‘Sustenance thou art: bestow sustenance upon me!’ He thereby takes sustenance (strength) to himself. Those same two round <i>s</i>atamânas are the fee for this ceremony. He gives them to the <span id="p105"><sup><small>[ p. 105 ]</small></sup></span> Brahman priest, for the Brahman protects the sacrifice from the south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman.

<span id="v5_4_3_2727"><sup><small>5:4:3:2727.</small></sup></span>  In front of the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's hearth the dish of curds for Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a has been deposited. He draws down to it his (the Sacrificer's) two arms [^208], with, ‘I draw you down, the arms of Indra, the doer of mighty deeds.’ Now curds are the essence of cattle: hence it is to the essence of cattle that he thereby brings down his (the Sacrificer's) arms. And as to its being for Mitra-Varu<i>n</i>a, it is because Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a are the two arms.


<span id="v5_4_4"><sup><small>5:4:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_4_4_11"><sup><small>5:4:4:11.</small></sup></span>  He proceeds with the curds for Mitra-Varu<i>n</i>a. Whilst the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of it remains yet unoffered, they bring a throne-seat for him (the king); for truly he who gains a seat in the air, gains a seat above (others): thus these subjects of his sit below him who is seated above,—that is why they bring him a throne-seat. It is of khadira (acacia catechu) wood, and perforated, and bound with thongs as that of the Bhâratas.

<span id="v5_4_4_22"><sup><small>5:4:4:22.</small></sup></span>  He places it (on the tiger's skin), in front of the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a's hearth, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 26), ‘Thou art pleasant, thou art soft-seated!’—he thereby renders it kindly and auspicious.

<span id="v5_4_4_33"><sup><small>5:4:4:33.</small></sup></span>  He then spreads a mantle over it, with, ‘Thou art the womb (seat) of knighthood!’—he thus <span id="p106"><sup><small>[ p. 106 ]</small></sup></span> makes it (the king's throne) the very womb of knighthood.

<span id="v5_4_4_44"><sup><small>5:4:4:44.</small></sup></span>  He then makes him sit down on it, with, ‘Seat thee on the pleasant one! seat thee on the soft-seated!’—whereby he says, ‘Seat thyself on the kindly and auspicious (seat)!’—‘Seat thee in the womb of knighthood!’—thus he places him in what is the very womb of knighthood.

<span id="v5_4_4_55"><sup><small>5:4:4:55.</small></sup></span>  Having touched him on the chest, he then mutters (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 27; <i>Ri</i>k S. I, 25, 10), ‘He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law,’—the king indeed is the upholder of the sacred law, for he is not capable of all and every speech, nor of all and every deed; but that he should speak only what is right, and do what is right, of that he, as well as the <i>S</i>rotriya (the Brâhman versed in sacred writ), is capable; for these two are the upholders of the sacred law among men: therefore he says, ‘He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law;’—‘Varu<i>n</i>a, in the home-steads,’—the home-steads are the peasants (clans, people): ‘among the peasants’ he means to say;—‘for supreme rule, he the wise!’—‘for kingship’ he means to say when he says, ‘for supreme rule, he the wise.’

<span id="v5_4_4_66"><sup><small>5:4:4:66.</small></sup></span>  He then throws the five dice [^209] into his hand, <span id="p107"><sup><small>[ p. 107 ]</small></sup></span> with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 28), ‘Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine prosper!’—now that <span id="p108"><sup><small>[ p. 108 ]</small></sup></span> one, the Kali, is indeed dominant over the (other) dice, for that one dominates over all the dice: therefore he says, ‘Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine prosper!’ for there are indeed five regions, and all the regions he thereby causes to prosper for him.

<span id="v5_4_4_77"><sup><small>5:4:4:77.</small></sup></span>  They (the Adhvaryu and his assistants) then silently strike him with sticks on the back;—by beating him with sticks (da<i>n</i><i>d</i>a) they guide him safely over judicial punishment (da<i>n</i><i>d</i>abadha): whence the king is exempt from punishment (ada<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya), because they guide him safely over judicial punishment.

<span id="v5_4_4_88"><sup><small>5:4:4:88.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he chooses a boon; and, verily, whatsoever boon he who has been anointed chooses, that is completely fulfilled for him: therefore he chooses a boon.

<span id="v5_4_4_99"><sup><small>5:4:4:99.</small></sup></span>  ‘O Brahman!’ thus he addresses (the priest) the first time [^210], thinking, ‘I will first utter the (word) <span id="p109"><sup><small>[ p. 109 ]</small></sup></span> Brahman, I will speak speech sped by the Brahman:’ this is why he first addresses him with ‘O Brahman!’ The other answers, ‘Thou art Brahman! Thou art Savit<i>ri</i> of true impulsion!’—he thereby lays vigour into him, and causes Savit<i>ri</i> to be of true impulsion.

<span id="v5_4_4_1010"><sup><small>5:4:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  ‘O Brahman!’ thus he addresses him the second time. The other answers, ‘Thou art Brahman! Thou art Varu<i>n</i>a of true power!’—he thereby lays vigour into him, and causes Varu<i>n</i>a to be of true power.

<span id="v5_4_4_1111"><sup><small>5:4:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  ‘O Brahman!’ thus he addresses him the third time. The other answers, ‘Thou art Brahman! Thou art Indra, mighty through the people [^211]!’—he thereby lays vigour into him, and causes Indra to be mighty through the people.

<span id="v5_4_4_1212"><sup><small>5:4:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘O Brahman!’ thus he addresses him the <span id="p110"><sup><small>[ p. 110 ]</small></sup></span> fourth time. The other answers, ‘Thou art Brahman! Thou art Rudra, the most kindly!’—he thereby lays into him (the king) those former energies, and he appeases him (Rudra); and he, Rudra, therefore, is gracious to every one, because he (the priest) appeases him.

<span id="v5_4_4_1313"><sup><small>5:4:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  ‘O Brahman!’ thus he addresses him the fifth time. The other answers (undefinedly), ‘Thou art Brahman!’—undefined means unlimited: thus heretofore he laid limited vigour into him; but now he answers undefinedly; and undefined meaning unlimited, he thereby lays complete, unlimited vigour into him: therefore he answers here undefinedly.

<span id="v5_4_4_1414"><sup><small>5:4:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then hails him as one bearing auspicious names,—‘Much-worker, better-worker, more-worker [^212]!’ Whoever bears such names speaks auspiciously even with a human voice.

<span id="v5_4_4_1515"><sup><small>5:4:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  A Brâhma<i>n</i>a then hands to him the sacrificial (wooden) sword,—either the Adhvaryu, or he who is his (the king's) domestic chaplain—with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!'—the sacrificial sword being a thunderbolt, that Brâhma<i>n</i>a, by means of that thunderbolt, makes the king to be weaker than himself; for indeed the king who is weaker than a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, is stronger than his enemies: thus he thereby makes him stronger than his enemies.

<span id="v5_4_4_1616"><sup><small>5:4:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  The king hands it to the king's brother, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the king makes his brother to be weaker than himself.

<span id="v5_4_4_1717"><sup><small>5:4:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  The king's brother hands it either to the <span id="p111"><sup><small>[ p. 111 ]</small></sup></span> Sûta (minstrel and chronicler), or to the Governor, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the king's brother makes the Sûta, or the Governor, to be weaker than himself.

<span id="v5_4_4_1818"><sup><small>5:4:4:1818.</small></sup></span>  The Sûta, or the Governor, hands it to the Grâma<i>n</i>î (village-headman [^213]), with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the Sûta, or the Governor, makes the headman to be weaker than himself.

<span id="v5_4_4_1919"><sup><small>5:4:4:1919.</small></sup></span>  The Grâma<i>n</i>î hands it to a tribesman [^214], with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the headman makes the tribesman to be weaker than himself. And as to why they mutually hand it on in this way, they do so lest there should be a confusion of classes, and in order that (society) may be in the proper order.

<span id="v5_4_4_2020"><sup><small>5:4:4:2020.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon the tribesman and the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> [^215], with that sacrificial sword, prepare the gaming-ground, (close) by the original fire [^216], with the puroru<i>k</i> verse of the <i>S</i>ukra [^217]. The <i>S</i>ukra is the eater: he thereby makes (him) the eater.

<span id="v5_4_4_2121"><sup><small>5:4:4:2121.</small></sup></span>  With the puroru<i>k</i> verse of the Manthin [^218] they then put up a shed (vimita). The Manthin cup is <span id="p112"><sup><small>[ p. 112 ]</small></sup></span> he that is to be eaten,—thus having first made (him) the feeder, they now make for him one to be fed upon: that is why they put up a shed with the puroru<i>k</i> verse of the Manthin cup.

<span id="v5_4_4_2222"><sup><small>5:4:4:2222.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu then takes clarified butter in four ladlings, places a piece of gold on the gaming-ground, and offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 29), ‘May ample Agni, the lord of rites, delighted,—may ample Agni, the lord of rites, accept of the butter, hail!’

<span id="v5_4_4_2323"><sup><small>5:4:4:2323.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) throws down the dice, with, 'Hallowed by Svâhâ, strive ye with Sûrya's rays for the middlemost place among brethren!' For that gaming-ground is the same as ‘ample Agni,’ and those dice are his coals, thus it is him (Agni) he thereby pleases; and assuredly in the house of him who offers the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, or who so knows this, the striking [^219] of that cow is approved of. On those dice he says, ‘Play for the cow!’ The two draught oxen of the original (hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.

<span id="v5_4_4_2424"><sup><small>5:4:4:2424.</small></sup></span>  He then says, ‘Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t!’ And as to why that ceremony is performed between two oblations,—verily, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,—and, indeed, they are even now produced after this one;—thus he places him (the Sacrificer) in the very middle of that Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and consecrates him in the very middle: that is why that ceremony is performed between two oblations. <span id="p113"><sup><small>[ p. 113 ]</small></sup></span> Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, ‘Pronounce the offering-formula to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t,’ and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered.

<span id="v5_4_4_2525"><sup><small>5:4:4:2525.</small></sup></span>  He then puts the i<i>d</i>â on (the fire). After the invocation of I<i>d</i>â, he touches water and draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup, he sets the chant agoing. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the chant (stotra), in attendance at the recitation (<i>s</i>astra).


<span id="v5_4_5"><sup><small>5:4:5</small></sup></span>

### THE DA<i>S</i>APEYA.

## FIFTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v5_4_5_11"><sup><small>5:4:5:11.</small></sup></span>  Now when Varu<i>n</i>a was consecrated, his lustre departed from him,—lustre means vigour: that Vish<i>n</i>u, the Sacrifice, it was he that departed from him,—probably that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is anointed on that occasion, drove out his lustre.

<span id="v5_4_5_22"><sup><small>5:4:5:22.</small></sup></span>  He stole after it with those deities [^220],—with Savit<i>ri</i>, the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>); with Sarasvatî, speech; with Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, the forms of being; with Pûshan, cattle; with Indra, on the part of him [^221] (the Sacrificer); with B<i>ri</i>haspati, holiness; with Varu<i>n</i>a, might; with Agni, fiery spirit; with Soma, the King; <span id="p114"><sup><small>[ p. 114 ]</small></sup></span> —but only through Vish<i>n</i>u [^222], the tenth deity, he found it.

<span id="v5_4_5_33"><sup><small>5:4:5:33.</small></sup></span>  And because he there stole after (anu-sam-s<i>ri</i>p) with those deities, hence the name Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>pa<i>h</i>. And because he becomes consecrated on the tenth day, therefore (this ceremony is called) Da<i>s</i>apeya [^223]. And because each time ten (men) steal along [^224] after each cup, therefore also it is called Da<i>s</i>apeya.

<span id="v5_4_5_44"><sup><small>5:4:5:44.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say,—‘Let him steal forth after enumerating ten Soma-drinking grandfathers [^225]: it is thus that he obtains for himself the Soma-draught of this (Da<i>s</i>apeya), for it is a “drinking of ten.”’ But that is an overburdening [^226], for people (will <span id="p115"><sup><small>[ p. 115 ]</small></sup></span> be able to) obtain only two or three Soma-drinking grandfathers: hence let him steal forth after enumerating those same deities [^227].

<span id="v5_4_5_55"><sup><small>5:4:5:55.</small></sup></span>  For, surely, it was by those same deities that Varu<i>n</i>a obtained the Soma-draught of that (Consecration-ceremony); and in like manner does this one now obtain the Soma-draught of that (ceremony): let him therefore steal forth after enumerating those same deities. Now as soon as the completing oblation [^228] of that Consecration-ceremony comes to an end,—

<span id="v5_4_5_66"><sup><small>5:4:5:66.</small></sup></span>  He prepares those (sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p) oblations,—a cake on twelve, or eight, potsherds for Savit<i>ri</i>; for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>, Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower [^229].

<span id="v5_4_5_77"><sup><small>5:4:5:77.</small></sup></span>  He then prepares a (rice) pap for Sarasvatî,—for Sarasvatî is speech, and it was with speech that Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with speech. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span id="v5_4_5_88"><sup><small>5:4:5:88.</small></sup></span>  He then prepares a cake on ten potsherds for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>,—for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> (the fashioner, creator) rules over living forms, and with Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, the living forms, Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in <span id="p116"><sup><small>[ p. 116 ]</small></sup></span> like manner does this one now steal along with Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, the living forms. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span id="v5_4_5_99"><sup><small>5:4:5:99.</small></sup></span>  He then prepares a pap for Pûshan;—for Pûshan is cattle, and with cattle Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with cattle. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span id="v5_4_5_1010"><sup><small>5:4:5:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra;—for Indriya means energy, vigour, and with vigour Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with energy, with vigour. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span id="v5_4_5_1111"><sup><small>5:4:5:1111.</small></sup></span>  He then prepares a pap for B<i>ri</i>haspati;—for B<i>ri</i>haspati means holiness, and with holiness Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in likes manner does this one now steal along with holiness. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span id="v5_4_5_1212"><sup><small>5:4:5:1212.</small></sup></span>  He then prepares a barley pap for Varu<i>n</i>a;—with what vehemence Varu<i>n</i>a seized the creatures, with that vehemence Varu<i>n</i>a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with vehemence. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span id="v5_4_5_1313"><sup><small>5:4:5:1313.</small></sup></span>  The deities of the Upasad are the (eighth, ninth, and) tenth [^230]. At these (oblations) he presents <span id="p117"><sup><small>[ p. 117 ]</small></sup></span> five lotus-flowers. That wreath of twelve lotus-flowers he puts on himself; that is the initiation: by that initiation he initiates himself.

<span id="v5_4_5_1414"><sup><small>5:4:5:1414.</small></sup></span>  And as to why there are twelve (flowers),—there being twelve months in the year, and the year being All, it is by the All that he thus initiates him: what flowers there are of the lotus, they are a form (an image) of the sky, they are a form of the stars; and what seed-stalks there are, they are a form of the air; and what suckers there are, they are a form of this (earth): thus he initiates him (to rule) over these worlds.

<span id="v5_4_5_1515"><sup><small>5:4:5:1515.</small></sup></span>  And having bought the King (Soma) [^231], and <span id="p118"><sup><small>[ p. 118 ]</small></sup></span> tied him up in two parts, they drive him around. Having then placed one-half on the throne-seat, he proceeds therewith. Having then placed on the throne-seat that portion which was deposited in the Brahman's house, he proceeds with the guest-meal. Whilst he is proceeding with the guest-meal, he performs the Upasads. Whilst he is performing the Upasads,—

<span id="v5_4_5_1616"><sup><small>5:4:5:1616.</small></sup></span>  He prepares those (three) oblations,—a cake on eight potsherds for Agni; a pap for Soma; and a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish<i>n</i>u. Thus he performs the sacrifice in this way, if it pleases him.

<span id="v5_4_5_1717"><sup><small>5:4:5:1717.</small></sup></span>  But let him not do it in this way; for he who departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who departs from the path of the Upasads certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice: let him therefore not depart from the path of the Upasads.

<span id="v5_4_5_1818"><sup><small>5:4:5:1818.</small></sup></span>  Now when he offers to Agni, he steals along with Agni, with fiery spirit; and when he offers to Soma, he steals along with Soma, the King; and when he offers to Vish<i>n</i>u,—Vish<i>n</i>u being the sacrifice,—he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own (or, takes it in).

<span id="v5_4_5_1919"><sup><small>5:4:5:1919.</small></sup></span>  This same (Da<i>s</i>apeya) is an Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice (performed) with the seventeenfold (stoma) [^232] for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the <span id="p119"><sup><small>[ p. 119 ]</small></sup></span> sacrifice [^233]: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.

<span id="v5_4_5_2020"><sup><small>5:4:5:2020.</small></sup></span>  Twelve heifers with first calf are the sacrificial fee for this (sacrifice); for twelve months there are in the year, and the year is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.

<span id="v5_4_5_2121"><sup><small>5:4:5:2121.</small></sup></span>  These (heifers) have twelve embryo calves,—that makes twenty-four; for twenty-four half-moons there are in the year, and the year is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.

<span id="v5_4_5_2222"><sup><small>5:4:5:2222.</small></sup></span>  He gives them to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman. To the Udgât<i>ri</i> (chanter) he gives the gold wreath, to the Hot<i>ri</i> the gold plate, to the two Adhvaryus two golden mirrors, to the Prastot<i>ri</i> (presenter) a horse, to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a a sterile cow, to the Brâhma<i>n</i>â_kh<i>a</i>m_sin a bull, to the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> and Pot<i>ri</i> two garments, to the A<i>kh</i>âvâka (a cart) laden with barley, and yoked (with an ox) on one side, to the Agnîdh an ox [^234].

<span id="v5_4_5_2323"><sup><small>5:4:5:2323.</small></sup></span>  Now there are here either twelve or thirteen [^235] presents,—for either twelve or thirteen are there months in the year, and the year is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it he makes it his own.

[^187]: 94:1 While the preceding formula is used by the priest, the present and two succeeding ones (each with the words ‘. . . I sprinkle thee; guard him against darts!’) are pronounced by the other three persons specified in [V, 3, 5, 12](Book_3_5_3#v5_3_5_12)\-[14](Book_3_5_3#v5_3_5_14), each sprinkling the king with the water in his respective vessel.

[^188]: 94:2 Mahîdhara explains: 'O Soma, protect him, the Sacrificer, in overcoming the enemy's missiles.’

[^189]: 95:1 Either at this juncture, or after the game at dice, the Hot<i>ri</i> recites the legend of <i>S</i>una<i>h</i><i>s</i>epha, as given Ait. Br. VII, 13-18.—‘King Hari<i>s</i><i>k</i>andra, of the race of Ikshvâku, being childless, made a vow that if he obtained a son he would sacrifice him to Varu<i>n</i>a. A son was born, who received the name of Rohita, but the father postponed, under various pretexts, the fulfilment of his vow. When at length he resolved to perform the sacrifice, Rohita refused to be the victim, and went out into the forest, where he lived for six years. He then met a poor Brâhman <i>Ri</i>shi called A<i>g</i>îgarta, who had three sons, and Rohita purchased from A<i>g</i>îgarta, for a hundred cows, the second son, named <i>S</i>una<i>h</i><i>s</i>epha, to be the substitute for himself in the sacrifice. Varu<i>n</i>a approved of the substitute, and the sacrifice was about to be performed, the father receiving another hundred cows for binding his son to the sacrificial post, and a third hundred for agreeing to slaughter him. Suna<i>h</i><i>s</i>epha, however, saved himself by reciting verses in honour of different deities, and was received into the family of Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra, who was one of the officiating priests.’ Dowson, Dict. of Hindu Mythology.

[^191]: 96:2 In the Black Ya<i>g</i>us ritual the three steps are called ‘krama, krânta, and vikrânta.’

[^192]: 97:1 By way of illustration, Mahîdhara explains what would have happened at the inauguration of king Da<i>s</i>aratha (of Ayodhyâ), the father of Râma; viz. in that case the first formula would run,—‘Râma is the father of Da<i>s</i>aratha;’ and the second—‘Da<i>s</i>aratha is the father of Râma.’ According to the ceremonial of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us the offering of the residue takes place at the house (first of the favourite son, according to Âpastamba, and then) of the queen.

[^193]: 98:1 The meaning of krivi (krayi, Taitt. S.) is doubtful. Mahîdhara derives it from ‘kar’ (to make or injure), in the sense of either ‘efficacious,’ or ‘destructive.’—A Grantha MS. of the Kâ<i>n</i>va text reads kavi, ‘wise.’

[^194]: 98:2 I am now inclined to think that some such meaning as ‘probably, perhaps’ (more nearly, German ‘wohl’), fits all the passages (in the Brâhma<i>n</i>as at all events) where <i>s</i>a<i>s</i>vat occurs.

[^195]: 98:3 See above, [V, 1, 4, 3](Book_3_5_1#v5_1_4_3) seq.

[^196]: 99:1 Pra<i>s</i>âst<i>ri</i>, ‘the director,’ is also another name for the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a priest.

[^197]: 99:2 That is, the cows given to priests as sacrificial fee. For particulars regarding the passage by which they are driven to their destination, see part ii, p. 344, note 1.

[^198]: 99:3 Probably here ‘for well-being;’ the author, however, evidently takes it here in the sense of ‘invigorating potion,’ the drink offered to the deceased ancestors.

[^199]: 100:1 In the ceremonial of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us a sham-fight takes place here. East or north of the sacrificial ground a Râ<i>g</i>anya has posted himself with bow in hand. The king discharges the arrows at him, with, ‘Obtained is the mind!’ and having thus, as it were, overpowered the enemy, ne wheels round in a sunwise direction, with, ‘I (have become endowed) with energy, with vigour!’ He then puts on shoes of boar's skin, with, ‘Thou art the mettle of cattle,’ gets down from the chariot, and puts on ornaments of silver, copper (as Sâya<i>n</i>a here interprets audumbara), and gold (afterwards to be given to the Brahman). Then follow the oblations relating to the unyoking of the chariot. Taitt. S. I, 8, 15, with commentary.

[^200]: 100:2 Viz. as many as he has taken from him, a hundred or more.

[^201]: 101:1 For a different version of this somewhat awkwardly constructed verse, see <i>Ri</i>k S. V, 33, 3.

[^202]: 101:2 The explanation is given because the word has also the meaning ‘ray.’

[^203]: 102:1 ? Or, means vigour, Indra.

[^204]: 103:1 Or perhaps, ‘in the best place (vara).’ See [VI, 7, 3, 11](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_3_11).

[^205]: 104:1 According to Taitt. Br. I, 7, 9, 6, the king, on returning to the Vedi, is supposed to have ascended to the heavenly world (suvargaloka), from which the charioteer is to be excluded by this expedient.

[^206]: 104:2 The Âhavanîya of the hall (the so-called ‘hall-door fire’) has been lifted and placed on a cart.

[^207]: 104:3 Or, two round (gold) plates, weighing a hundred mina (or berries of Gu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>â, or Abrus Precatorius, the average weight of which is stated to be 1 5/16 grains Troy).

[^208]: 105:1 Whilst this is done, the king stands on the tiger's skin, and the Adhvaryu hands him his bow and arrows. Thereupon the dish of curds is taken to the uttaravedi to be proceeded with. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XV, 6, 34-35.

[^209]: 106:1 The allusions to the game of dice in the early literature are not sufficiently definite to enable us to form a clear idea as to the manner in which the game was played. Sâya<i>n</i>a, on our passage (as on Taitt. S. I, 8, 16), remarks that the dice here used consisted either of gold cowries (shells) or of gold (dice shaped like) Vibhîtaka nuts. That the (brown) fruit of the Vibhîtaka tree (Terminalia Bellerica)—being of about the size of a nutmeg, nearly round, with five slightly flattened sides—was commonly used for this purpose in early times, we know from the Rig-veda; but we do not know in what manner the dice were marked in those days. According p. 107 to the commentators, the game is played with five dice, four of which are called k<i>ri</i>ta, whilst the fifth is called kali; and if all the dice fall uniformly (ekarûpa)—i.e. with the marked sides either upwards or downwards—then the player wins, and in that case the kali is said to overrule the other dice. In this case the kali would seem to represent the king. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XV, 7, 18-19, however, admits of another mode of playing, by which the kali represents the sa<i>g</i>âta (tribesman), whilst the king and those that come after him (in the enumeration in paragraphs 15-20) play the k<i>ri</i>ta, &c, To understand this mode, we have probably to turn to <i>Kh</i>andog. Up. IV, 1, 4, where it is said of the saint Raikva, that everything good fell to him, just as the lower dice (or casts) submit to the conquering k<i>ri</i>ta. Here the commentators assign the names k<i>ri</i>ta, tretâ, dvâpara, and kali to different sides of the die, marked respectively with 4, 3, 2, and 1 marks (aṅka).—In Taitt. Br. I, 7, 10 the game at dice, at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, is referred to as follows:—With, ‘This king has overcome the regions,’ he hands (to the king) five dice; for these are all the dice: he thereby renders him invincible. They engage (to play) for a dish of rice (odana), for that is (a symbol of) the chief: he thus makes him obtain every prosperity. He addresses them (with the epithets of) ‘far-famed, most prosperous, true king.’ The Commentary and Sûtras then supply the following explanations:—The keeper of the dice (akshâvâpa), having (marked off and) raised the gambling-ground (by means of the wooden sword), and sprinkled it, throws down more than a hundred—or more than a thousand—gold dice. From them he takes five dice and hands them to the king: these, as representing the five regions, are taken to include all those dice. These explanations, so far from clearing up the doubtful points, seem rather to add to them. It may be noted, however, that in the well-known hymn, <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 34, in which the gambler's state of mind is pictured in very expressive language, the dice of the game are apparently spoken of as tripa<i>ñ</i>kâ<i>s</i>a vrâta, or ‘the troop of fifty-three’ (or thrice five, according to Ludwig's rather improbable conjecture). For other particulars see R. Roth, Zeitsch. d. deutsch. morg. Ges. II, p. 122; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 284. According to Goldstücker (s.v. abhishe<i>k</i>anîya) this game of dice is intended to symbolize the victory of the present age, or kali-yuga, over the former ages; but the commentator rather takes it as symbolizing the king's dig-vi<i>g</i>aya, or victorious sway in every quarter.

[^210]: 108:1 If it were not for the clear and unmistakable interpretation of the commentators on the Brâhma<i>n</i>a and Kâtyâyana, one might feel inclined to translate, ‘thus he addresses the first—the second,’ &c., so as to bring it into accord with the practice of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us. This practice is as follows (Taitt. S. I, 8, 16, with commentary).—The priest moves the previously uplifted arms of the Sacrificer down to the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva dish of curds (cf. above, V, 4, 3, 27), with, ‘Thou art Mitra!—thou art Varu<i>n</i>a!’ He then places the khâdira throne-seat on the vedi, covers it with a leathern (or fur) cover, with, ‘Thou art the navel of the Kshatra, the womb of the Kshatra,’ and makes the king sit down with, ‘Seat thee on the pleasant one, seat thee on the soft-seated!’ The king sits down, with, ‘May it not injure thee! may it not injure me!’ The priest then addresses him, with, ‘He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law, Varu<i>n</i>a in the homesteads, for supreme rule, he the wise!’ The priests and Ratnins (see V, 3, 1, 1 seq.) then sit down in a circle round the king in. order to do homage to him,—the Adhvaryu being seated towards the east, the Brahman towards the south, the Hot<i>ri</i> p. 109 towards the west, the Udgât<i>ri</i> towards the north. The king then addresses the Adhvaryu, with, ‘O Brahman, (Om)!’ That priest replies, ‘Thou, O king, art Brahman, thou art Savit<i>ri</i> of true impulsion.’ In the same way the king addresses the Brahman, ‘O Brahman!’ and that priest replies, ‘Thou, O king, art Brahman, thou art Indra, of true energy!’ Then the Hot<i>ri</i>, who replies, ‘. . . thou art Mitra, the most kindly!’—the Udgât<i>ri</i>: ‘. . . thou art Varu<i>n</i>a, of true laws!’ Thereupon the Brahman hands the sacrificial sword to the king, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art!' He then hands to him five dice, with, ‘This king has overcome the regions!’ see next note.—The charioteer, treasurer, and chamberlain are invited by the king (to the game?) by auspicious epithets (‘far-famed one,’ ‘most prosperous one,’ ‘true king’). Thereupon the Hot<i>ri</i> recites the story of <i>S</i>una<i>h</i><i>s</i>epa, whereupon follows the offering of the svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of the cake of the Maruts, and the dish of curds to the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i>.

[^211]: 109:1 Or, he whose strength is the people (vi<i>s</i>, vi<i>s</i>a),—that is, the Maruts, in the case of Indra, and the subjects or peasantry in that of the king. Sây.

[^212]: 110:1 That is, increaser of the prosperity of himself and his people.

[^213]: 111:1 See [p. 60](Book_3_5_3#p60), note \*[1](Book_3_5_3#fn129)\*.

[^214]: 111:2 The sa<i>g</i>âta would seem to be one of the peasant proprietors or ‘sharers’ constituting the village ‘brotherhood’ ruled over by the headman, and often actually belonging to the same family as the latter (Gaugenosse, clansman).

[^215]: 111:3 The first assistant of the Adhvaryu.

[^216]: 111:4 That is, north of the Âhavanîya fire, where the cart stands, containing the original (hall-door) fire.

[^217]: 111:5 For this verse (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 12; <i>Ri</i>k S. V, 44, 1), preceding the ordinary formula with which the Soma-cups are drawn, see IV, 2, 1, 9 (part ii, p. 280).

[^218]: 111:6 Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 16; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 723, 7; see IV, 2, 7, 70.

[^219]: 112:1 Thus (not the slaying) according to the commentary on Kâty. Sr. XV, 7, 20, hanti<i>s</i> <i>k</i>âhananamâtro na mâra<i>n</i>ârtha<i>h</i>.—The cow is the one staked by the tribesman (sa<i>g</i>âta).

[^220]: 113:1 In the Black Ya<i>g</i>us ritual the order of deities to whom the ‘sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>pâ<i>m</i> havî<i>m</i>shi’ are offered is as follows,—Agni, Sarasvatî, Savit<i>ri</i>, Pûshan, B<i>ri</i>haspati, Indra, Varu<i>n</i>a, Soma, Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, Vish<i>n</i>u. Cf. Taitt. S. I, 8, 17; Taitt. Br. I, 8, 1.

[^221]: 113:2 Or, with Indra, for (the lost vigour) itself. Hardly, ‘for us.’ The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has ‘indre<i>n</i>âsmai,’ and so Sâya<i>n</i>a (MS. I. O. 657): asmai apas<i>ri</i>tâya vîryâya tadadhînakara<i>n</i>ârtham indre<i>n</i>a; yad vâ vibhaktivyatyaya<i>h</i>, anena vîrye<i>n</i>a vîryavatâ indre<i>n</i>a.

[^222]: 114:1 It seems rather strange that Varu<i>n</i>a and Vish<i>n</i>u should be included amongst the deities, with whose help Varu<i>n</i>a sought to recover his vigour, or Vish<i>n</i>u the sacrifice; but—’Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

[^223]: 114:2 That is, da<i>s</i>a (ten) and peya (drink, beverage).

[^224]: 114:3 For an explanation of the noiseless mode of moving with bent bodies, called sarpa<i>n</i>am, ‘creeping,’ see part ii, pp. 299, 450. It is in this way they are to move when they betake themselves to the respective fire-places for performing the sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p oblations; as they also do when betaking themselves to the Sadas to drink the cups of Soma at the Soma-feast on the next day. When libations of Soma-juice are made from the ten cups (<i>k</i>amasa, see part ii, p. 287), each cup is to be followed by ten Brâhmans who then take part in consuming the liquor in the Sadas—there being thus altogether one hundred Brâhmans taking part in these potations. The contents of the Sacrificer's cup, on the other hand, may be drunk by ten Ra<i>g</i>anyas (i.e. himself and nine others). See Kâty. XV, 8, 18-20; Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 179.

[^225]: 114:4 Sâya<i>n</i>a takes this literally as meaning that he is to call out the name of the Sacrificer's grandfather, then the grandfather of that one and so on. The commentary on Kâty. XV, 8, 16, on the other hand, apparently takes it to mean ten forefathers of the Sacrificer who have performed Soma-sacrifices, from the grandfather upwards.

[^226]: 114:5 That is, an excessive demand, or, a weighing down, or crushing of the Sacrificer, making it impossible for him to perform the ceremony at all.

[^227]: 115:1 That is to say, after pronouncing the mantra, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X, 30. agreeing partly with [paragraph 2](Book_3_5_4#v5_4_5_2) above, viz. beginning, ‘By Savit<i>ri</i>, the impeller; by Sarasvatî, speech,’ . . . and ending, ‘by Vish<i>n</i>u, the tenth deity, impelled I steal forth.’

[^228]: 115:2 For the Udavasânîyâ ish<i>t</i>i, see part ii, p. 389.

[^229]: 115:3 The lotus-flowers presented on this occasion are gold ones, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, or optionally ordinary white or gold ones, according to Kâty. XV, 8, 5-6.

[^230]: 116:1 For the Upasad, or preliminary oblations of ghee to Agni, Soma, and Vish<i>n</i>u, to be performed twice daily for (usually) three days preceding an ordinary Soma-sacrifice, see part ii, p. 104. At the Da<i>s</i>apeya, the ten Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblations take as it were the place of the ordinary Upasads, the latter being performed on the last three preliminary days along with, and to the same deities as, the last three Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblations; or, according to some authorities, p. 117 being substituted for them. There seems also some difference of opinion as to the exact time when the other preliminary ceremonies—the procession and entrance of king Soma, the guest-meal, &c.—are to take place, see [paragraph 15](Book_3_5_4#v5_4_5_15).—According to Kâty. XV, 8,14, these ceremonies are to take place on the seventh day (which the commentator, however, takes to mean the seventh day of the light fortnight of <i>K</i>aitra; the first seven Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblations being, according to him, performed on the day before). The Kâ<i>n</i>vas, however, perform these offerings on separate days.—The Taittirîya authorities seem also to be at variance with each other as to the exact relation of the Upasads and the last three Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblations, the deities of the two being, according to their scheme, only partly identical. According to Âpastamba (and Taitt. Br.) the first seven Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>ps are performed on so many days and, moreover, one Dîkshâ on the seventh day. Then on the last three days the Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>ps and Upasads are combined in this way, that the eighth day's Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p is performed previous to, the ninth between, the tenth after the two daily Upasad-performances.—Each of the ten oblations also requires a special set of fires for its performance, the first being laid down immediately north of the one used for the Abhishe<i>k</i>anîya ceremony, the second immediately north of the first, &c.; the last Sa<i>m</i>s<i>ri</i>p-oblation being performed in the fire-shed (<i>s</i>âlâ) of the Da<i>s</i>apeya proper. Kâty. XV, 8, 2-3; cf. Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 176.

[^231]: 117:1 Namely, at the beginning of the Abhishe<i>k</i>anîya, or Consecration-ceremony, when Soma-plants are purchased sufficient to last p. 118 for both that ceremony and the succeeding Da<i>s</i>apeya; the portion destined for the latter ceremony being meanwhile deposited in the Brahman's house.

[^232]: 118:1 All the chants (stotra) of the Da<i>s</i>apeya are to be executed in the seventeenfold mode of chanting, or Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma; for an example of which see part ii, p. 315, note 1.

[^233]: 119:1 See [p. 8](Book_3_5_1#p8), note \*[1](Book_3_5_1#fn39)\*.

[^234]: 119:2 The text has ‘gam agnîdhe,’ i.e. either ‘a bull,’ or ‘a cow.’ So also Katy. XV. 8, 27. Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, refers to another authority,—ana<i>d</i>vâham agnîdha iti sûtritam, . . . vahnir vâ ana<i>d</i>van iti hi taittirîyakam.

[^235]: 119:3 That is, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, counting the unborn calves.
