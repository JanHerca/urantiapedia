### THE FOURTH LAYER.

## FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v8_4_1_11"><sup><small>8:4:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He lays down the fourth layer. For the gods having laid down the third layer, now ascended; but, the third layer being the air; it was the air which, having completed it, they ascended.

<span id="v8_4_1_22"><sup><small>8:4:1:22.</small></sup></span>  They spake, ‘Meditate ye!’ whereby, indeed, <span id="p59"><sup><small>[ p. 59 ]</small></sup></span> they meant to say, ‘Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!’ Whilst meditating, they saw that fourth layer, (to wit) what is above the air and below the heavens; that world was to their minds, as it were, unstable and unsettled.

<span id="v8_4_1_33"><sup><small>8:4:1:33.</small></sup></span>  They said to the Brahman, ‘We will lay thee down (or, set thee up) here!’—‘What will therefrom accrue to me?’—‘Thou shalt be the highest of us!’—‘So be it!’ They accordingly laid the Brahman down here, whence people say that the Brahman is the highest of gods. Now, by this fourth layer these two, heaven and earth, are upheld, and the fourth layer is the Brahman, whence people say that heaven and earth are upheld by the Brahman. He lays down the Stomas (hymn-forms) [^130]: the stomas being the vital airs, and the Brahman also being the vital airs, it is the Brahman he thereby lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_44"><sup><small>8:4:1:44.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. The gods, at that time, said to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, ‘We will lay thee down here! So be it!’ He did not say, ‘What will therefrom accrue unto me?’ but whenever Pra<i>g</i>âpati wished to obtain anything from the gods, they said, ‘What will therefrom accrue to us?’ And hence even now if a father wishes to obtain anything from his sons, they say, ‘What will therefrom <span id="p60"><sup><small>[ p. 60 ]</small></sup></span> accrue unto us?’ and when the sons (wish to obtain anything) from the father, he says, ‘So be it!’ for in this way Pra<i>g</i>âpati and the gods used of old to converse together. He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati also being the vital airs, it is Pra<i>g</i>âpati he thus lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_55"><sup><small>8:4:1:55.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. Those vital airs, the <i>Ri</i>shis [^131], that saw this fourth layer [^132], and who stepped nigh with that essential element (of the altar), are these (vital airs): it is them he now lays down. He lays down the Stomas:—the stomas being the vital airs, and the <i>Ri</i>shis also being the vital airs, it is the <i>Ri</i>shis he thus lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_66"><sup><small>8:4:1:66.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati had become relaxed (disjointed), the gods took him and went away. Vâyu, taking that (part) of him which was above the waist and below the head, kept going away from him, having become the deities and the forms of the year.

<span id="v8_4_1_77"><sup><small>8:4:1:77.</small></sup></span>  He spake to him, ‘Come to me and restore to me that wherewith thou hast gone from me!’—‘What will therefrom accrue unto me?’—‘That part of my self shall be sacred unto thee!’—‘So be it!’ thus Vâyu restored that unto him.

<span id="v8_4_1_88"><sup><small>8:4:1:88.</small></sup></span>  Those eighteen (bricks [^133]) which there are at <span id="p61"><sup><small>[ p. 61 ]</small></sup></span> first, are that very (part) of his (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) body; and when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his body which these (form): therefore he places them in this (layer). He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Vâyu (the wind) also being the vital airs, it is Vâyu he thus lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_99"><sup><small>8:4:1:99.</small></sup></span>  In front he lays down one, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 23), ‘The swift one, the Triv<i>ri</i>t!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is triv<i>ri</i>t (threefold, or thrice-three-versed). And as to why he calls it ‘the swift one,’ it is because this, indeed, is the swiftest of stomas. But the swift threefold one, doubtless, is Vâyu: he exists in these three worlds. And as to why he calls him ‘the swift one,’ it is because he is the swiftest of all beings: being (or, in the form of) Vâyu it remained in front,—it is that form he now lays down,

<span id="v8_4_1_1010"><sup><small>8:4:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  \[^134], with\], ‘The bright one [^135], the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that <span id="p62"><sup><small>[ p. 62 ]</small></sup></span> hymn-form which is fifteenfold (fifteen-versed). And when he calls it ‘the bright one,’ it is that the bright one is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold. But the bright, fifteenfold one, doubtless, also is the Moon: he waxes during fifteen days, and wanes during fifteen days. And as to his calling him ‘the bright one,’ the Moon indeed shines: being the Moon it remained on the right side,—it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1111"><sup><small>8:4:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  \[The left (north) one, with\], ‘The (aerial) space, the Saptada<i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is seventeenfold. And as to his calling it ‘the space,’—the (aerial) space is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the seventeenfold one is Pra<i>g</i>âpati. But indeed the seventeenfold space also is the year: in it there are twelve months and five seasons. And as to his calling it space, the year indeed is space: being space, it remained on the left side,—it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1212"><sup><small>8:4:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  \[The right (south) one, with\], ‘The upholder, the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-one-fold. And as to his calling it ‘the upholder,’—the upholder means a foothold, and the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a is a foothold. But indeed the twenty-one-fold upholder also is yonder sun: to him belong the twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun himself is the upholder, the twenty-one-fold. And as to his calling him ‘the upholder,’—when he sets everything here holds its peace: being the sun, it remained at the back,—it is that form he now lays down; and the forms of the year he lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1313"><sup><small>8:4:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  ‘Speed, the Ash<i>t</i>âda<i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is eighteenfold. Now, <span id="p63"><sup><small>[ p. 63 ]</small></sup></span> speed, the eighteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, five seasons, and the year itself is speed, the eighteenfold. And as to his calling it ‘speed,’ the year indeed speeds all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1414"><sup><small>8:4:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  ‘Heat, the Navada<i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is nineteenfold. But heat, the nineteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, six seasons, and the year itself is heat, the nineteenfold. And as to his calling it ‘heat,’ the year indeed burns all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1515"><sup><small>8:4:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  ‘Victorious assault, the Savi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twentyfold. But victorious assault, the twentyfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, and the year itself is victorious assault, the twentyfold. And as to why he calls it ‘victorious assault,’ the year indeed assails all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1616"><sup><small>8:4:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  ‘Vigour, the Dvâvi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-two-fold. But vigour, the twenty-two-fold one, doubtless is the year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is vigour, the twenty-two-fold. And as to why he calls it ‘vigour,’ the year is indeed the most vigorous of all existing things: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1717"><sup><small>8:4:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  ‘The array, the Trayovi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-three-fold. But array, the twenty-three-fold one, doubtless, means the year: in it there are thirteen months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the array, the twenty-three-fold. <span id="p64"><sup><small>[ p. 64 ]</small></sup></span> And as to his calling it ‘array,’ the year is indeed arrayed over all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1818"><sup><small>8:4:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  ‘The womb, the <i>K</i>aturvi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-four-fold. But the womb, the twenty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months. And as to his calling it ‘the womb,’ the year is indeed the womb of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_1919"><sup><small>8:4:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  ‘The embryos, the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-five-fold. But the embryos, the twenty-five-fold one, doubtless; is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, and the year itself is the embryos, the twenty-five-fold. And as to his calling it ‘the embryos,’—the year, as an embryo, in the shape of the thirteenth month, enters the seasons: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_2020"><sup><small>8:4:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  ‘Strength, the Tri<i>n</i>ava!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thrice ninefold. And as to his calling it ‘strength,’—strength (o<i>g</i>as) means the thunderbolt (va<i>g</i>ra), and the Tri<i>n</i>ava is a thunderbolt. But strength also means the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, the two, day and night, and the year itself is strength, the thrice-ninefold. And as to his calling it ‘strength,’ the year indeed is the strength of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_2121"><sup><small>8:4:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  ‘Design, the Ekatri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-one-fold. But design, the thirty-one-fold, doubtless, means the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, and the year itself is design, the thirty-one-fold. And <span id="p65"><sup><small>[ p. 65 ]</small></sup></span> as to his calling it ‘design,’ the year indeed designs (makes, forms) all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_2222"><sup><small>8:4:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  ‘The foundation, the Trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-three-fold. And as to why he calls it ‘the foundation,’ the thirty-three-fold is indeed a foundation. But indeed the foundation, the thirty-three-fold, also is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the foundation, the thirty-three-fold. And as to his calling it ‘the foundation,’ the year is indeed the foundation of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_2323"><sup><small>8:4:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  ‘The range of the ruddy one, the <i>K</i>atustri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-four-fold. But the range of the ruddy one (the sun), the thirty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the range of the ruddy one, the thirty-four-fold. And as to his calling it ‘the range of the ruddy one,’ the range of the ruddy one, doubtless, means supreme sway, and the thirty-four-fold one means supreme sway: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_2424"><sup><small>8:4:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  ‘The firmament, the Sha<i>t</i>tri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-six-fold. But the firmament, the thirty-six-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-moons, and twelve months. And as to why he calls it ‘the firmament’ (nâkam), it is because there is no pain (na akam) for whosoever goes there. And the firmament indeed is the year, the heavenly world is the year: it is that form he now lays down. <span id="p66"><sup><small>[ p. 66 ]</small></sup></span> 8:4:1:2525\. ‘The revolving sphere, the Ash<i>t</i>â<i>k</i>atvâri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a!’ he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is forty-eight-fold. But the revolving sphere, the forty-eight-fold, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-six half-months, thirteen months, seven seasons, and the two, day and night. And as to his calling it ‘the revolving sphere,’ from the year all creatures indeed are evolved: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="v8_4_1_2626"><sup><small>8:4:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  ‘The stay, the <i>K</i>atush<i>t</i>oma!’ he therewith lays down the chant of praise consisting of four stomas [^136]. And as to his calling it ‘the stay,’—stay means support, and the <i>K</i>atush<i>t</i>oma is a support. But the stay, the <i>K</i>atush<i>t</i>oma, doubtless, is Vâyu (the wind), for he sings from all those four quarters. And as to his calling him ‘the stay,’—stay means support; and the wind indeed is the support of all beings: it is that form he now lays down. The wind he places first and last: by the wind he thus encloses all these beings on both sides.

<span id="v8_4_1_2727"><sup><small>8:4:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  These, then, are eighteen bricks he lays down; this makes two Triv<i>ri</i>ts,—the Triv<i>ri</i>t being breath, and breath being wind, this layer is Vâyu.

<span id="v8_4_1_2828"><sup><small>8:4:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  And as to why there are eighteen,—the year is eighteenfold: twelve months and six seasons. And Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed is the year, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is eighteenfold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he makes it when he lays it down.


<span id="v8_4_2"><sup><small>8:4:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v8_4_2_11"><sup><small>8:4:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down the Sp<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i> [^137] (freeing <span id="p67"><sup><small>[ p. 67 ]</small></sup></span> bricks). For when that (part) of his body had been restored, Pra<i>g</i>âpati became pregnant with all beings: whilst they were in his womb, evil, death, seized them.

<span id="v8_4_2_22"><sup><small>8:4:2:22.</small></sup></span>  He spake to the gods, ‘With you I will free all these beings from evil, from death [^138]!’—‘What will accrue unto us therefrom?’—‘Choose ye!’ said he.—‘Let there be a share for us!’ said some to him. ‘Let lordship be unto us!’ said others. Having bestowed a share on some, and lordship on others, he freed all beings from evil, from death; and inasmuch as he freed (sp<i>ri</i>) them, therefore (those bricks are called) ‘Sp<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i>.’ And in like manner does this Sacrificer, by bestowing a share on some, and lordship on others, now free all beings from evil, from death; and hence (the word) ‘sp<i>ri</i>tam (freed)’ recurs with all of them.

<span id="v8_4_2_33"><sup><small>8:4:2:33.</small></sup></span>  \[^139], with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 24-26\], Agni's share thou art, Dîkshâ's lordship!'—Dîkshâ, doubtless, is Speech: having bestowed a share on Agni, he bestows lordship on Speech;—‘the Brahman is freed; the Triv<i>ri</i>t-stoma!’—by means of the thrice-threefold hymn-form he freed <span id="p68"><sup><small>[ p. 68 ]</small></sup></span> the Brahman (priesthood) for living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_44"><sup><small>8:4:2:44.</small></sup></span>  'Indra's share thou art, Vish<i>n</i>u's lordship!'—Having bestowed a share on Indra, he bestowed lordship on Vish<i>n</i>u;—‘the Kshatra is freed; the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a-stoma!’—by means of the fifteenfold hymn-form he freed the Kshatra (nobility) for living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_55"><sup><small>8:4:2:55.</small></sup></span>  'The man-viewers’ share thou art, the creator's lordship!'—the man-viewers, doubtless, are the gods: having bestowed a share on the gods, he bestowed lordship on the creator;—‘the birthplace is freed, the Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma!’—the birthplace, doubtless, is the peasantry: by means of the seventeenfold hymn-form he frees the peasantry for living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_66"><sup><small>8:4:2:66.</small></sup></span>  'Mitra's share thou art, Varu<i>n</i>a s lordship!'—Mitra, doubtless, is the out-breathing, and Varu<i>n</i>a the down-breathing: having bestowed a share on the out-breathing, he bestowed lordship on the down-breathing;—'heaven's rain, the wind is freed; the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stoma!'—by means of the twenty-one-fold hymn-form he frees both rain and wind for living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_77"><sup><small>8:4:2:77.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Vasus’ share thou art, the Rudras’ lordship!'—having bestowed a share on the Vasus, he bestowed lordship on the Rudras;—‘the four-footed is freed, the <i>K</i>aturvi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stoma!’—by means of the twenty-five-fold hymn-form he freed the four-footed for living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_88"><sup><small>8:4:2:88.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Âdityas’ share thou art, the Maruts’ lordship!’—having bestowed a share on the Âdityas, he bestowed lordship on the Maruts;—‘the <span id="p69"><sup><small>[ p. 69 ]</small></sup></span> embryos are freed, the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stoma!’—by means of the twenty-five-fold hymn-form he freed the embryos for living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_99"><sup><small>8:4:2:99.</small></sup></span>  'Aditi's share thou art, Pûshan's lordship!'—Aditi, doubtless, is this (earth): having bestowed a share on her, he bestowed lordship on Pûshan,—‘vigour is freed; the Tri<i>n</i>ava-stoma!’ by means of the thrice-ninefold hymn-form he freed vigour for living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_1010"><sup><small>8:4:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  'God Savit<i>ri</i>'s share thou art, B<i>ri</i>haspati's lordship!'—having bestowed a share on the god Savit<i>ri</i>, he bestows lordship on B<i>ri</i>haspati;—‘the facing quarters are freed, the <i>K</i>atush<i>t</i>oma!’—by means of the chant of praise consisting of four stomas he freed all the (four) quarters for living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_1111"><sup><small>8:4:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Yavas’ share thou art, the Ayavas’ lordship!’—the Yavas, doubtless, are the first (light) fortnights, and the Ayavas the latter (dark) fortnights, for these gain (yu) and obtain (â-yu) everything here [^140]: having bestowed a share on the first fortnights, he bestowed lordship on the latter fortnights;—‘the creatures are freed, the <i>K</i>atus<i>k</i>atvâri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stoma!’—by means of the forty-four-fold hymn-form he freed all creatures from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_1212"><sup><small>8:4:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Ribhus’ share thou art, the All-gods’ lordship!’—having bestowed a share on the Ribhus, he bestowed lordship on the Vi<i>s</i>ve-Devâ<i>h</i>;— <span id="p70"><sup><small>[ p. 70 ]</small></sup></span> ‘the living being is freed, the Trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stoma!’—by means of the thirty-three-fold hymn-form he freed all living beings from evil, from death; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of the thirty-three-fold hymn-form, now free all living beings from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_1313"><sup><small>8:4:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  These, then, are ten bricks he lays down,—the Virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten syllables, and Agni is Virâ<i>g</i> (wide-shining); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus frees all these creatures from evil, from death.

<span id="v8_4_2_1414"><sup><small>8:4:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down two <i>Ri</i>tavyâs [^141] (seasonal bricks);—the seasonal ones being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus lays down;—with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 27), ‘Saha and Sahasya, the two winter-seasons!’ These are the names of those two, it is with their names he thus lays them down. There are two such bricks, for a season consists of two months. Only once he settles them: he thus makes (the two months) one season.

<span id="v8_4_2_1515"><sup><small>8:4:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he places these two (bricks) in this (layer),—this Agni (fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds: what part thereof is above the air, and below the sky, that is this fourth layer, and that is the winter-season thereof; and when he places these two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati-Agni, the year and fire-altar) what part of his body these two (constitute). This is why he places these two in this (layer). <span id="p71"><sup><small>[ p. 71 ]</small></sup></span> 8:4:2:1616\. And, again, as to why he places these two in this (layer),—this Agni is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year: what (part) of him there is above the waist, and below the head, that is this fourth layer, and that is the winter-season of him (or, of it, the year). And when he places these two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him what part of his body these two (constitute). This is why he places these two in this (layer).


<span id="v8_4_3"><sup><small>8:4:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v8_4_3_11"><sup><small>8:4:3:11.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down the Srish<i>t</i>is [^142] (creations). For Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having freed all beings from evil, <span id="p72"><sup><small>[ p. 72 ]</small></sup></span> from death, he now desired, ‘May I produce creatures, may I procreate!’

<span id="v8_4_3_22"><sup><small>8:4:3:22.</small></sup></span>  He spake unto the vital airs [^143], ‘Together with you, I will here bring forth creatures!’—‘Wherewith shall we sing praises [^144]?’—‘With me and with <span id="p73"><sup><small>[ p. 73 ]</small></sup></span> yourselves!’—‘So be it!’ So they sang praises both with the vital airs and with Pra<i>g</i>âpati; and whatsoever the gods do, that they do with praise, that—praise being sacrifice—they do with sacrifice. Hence (the words) ‘they sang praises’ recur with all (these bricks).

<span id="v8_4_3_33"><sup><small>8:4:3:33.</small></sup></span>  \[They lay them down, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

He lays them on all sides: from all sides he thus makes these creatures to enter him.


<span id="v8_4_4"><sup><small>8:4:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v8_4_4_11"><sup><small>8:4:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Now, then, as to the order of proceeding. That (brick) which contains the Triv<i>ri</i>t (thrice-threefold stoma) he places in front, that containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma) at the back, that containing the fifteenfold (stoma) on the right (south) side, that containing the seventeenfold (stoma) on the left (north) side.

<span id="v8_4_4_22"><sup><small>8:4:4:22.</small></sup></span>  Now when the one containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t had been laid down, Death lay in wait for Pra<i>g</i>âpati in the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma), thinking, ‘After that he will lay down this one: I will here seize upon him!’ He (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) was aware of him, and having seen him, he walked round and laid down (at the back) the (brick) containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma). Death came thither, and he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) laid down the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma). Death came to the fifteenfold one, and he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) laid down the one (on the north side) containing the seventeenfold (stoma). It was here [^146] that he put down and confounded Death; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now put down and confound all evils <span id="p78"><sup><small>[ p. 78 ]</small></sup></span> 8:4:4:33\. Then as to the subsequent (bricks). Alongside of the one (in front) containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t he lays down one containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t; alongside of that (at the back) containing the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (he lays down) one containing the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a; alongside of that (on the south, or right, side) containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a (he lays down) one containing the Saptada<i>s</i>a; alongside of that (on the north, or left, side) containing the Saptada<i>s</i>a (he lays down) one containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a. And because he thus changes in laying them down [^147], therefore they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas; and because these stomas are then otherwise with regard to the former ones [^148], therefore also they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas. And in this way the gods laid them down, and otherwise the Asuras; whereupon the gods succeeded, and the Asuras came to naught: he who knows this, succeeds of himself, and his hateful enemy comes to naught.

<span id="v8_4_4_44"><sup><small>8:4:4:44.</small></sup></span>  Now, this Agni (fire-altar) is an animal, and he is made up (restored) here whole and entire. His head is the two (bricks) containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t; and as to why these two are such as contain the Triv<i>ri</i>t,—the head is threefold (triv<i>ri</i>t). There are two of them, because the head consists of two bones (kapâla). He lays them down in front, for this head is in the front (of the animal).

<span id="v8_4_4_55"><sup><small>8:4:4:55.</small></sup></span>  The two (behind) containing the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a are the foundation (the feet). And as to why these are such as contain the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a,—the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a is <span id="p79"><sup><small>[ p. 79 ]</small></sup></span> a foundation. There are two of them,—because the foundation is a pair (of feet). He places them behind, because this foundation (the hind-feet) is behind.

<span id="v8_4_4_66"><sup><small>8:4:4:66.</small></sup></span>  The two containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a [^149] are the arms (or fore-feet). And as to why these are such as contain the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a,—the arms are fifteenfold. There are two of them, because these arms are two. He places them on the sides, because these two arms are at the sides.

<span id="v8_4_4_77"><sup><small>8:4:4:77.</small></sup></span>  The two containing the Saptada<i>s</i>a are food. And as to why they are such as contain the Saptada<i>s</i>a,—food is seventeenfold. There are two of them, because ‘anna’ (food) has two syllables. He lays them down close to those containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a he thus puts the food close to the arms. Those containing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a are on the outside, and those containing the Saptada<i>s</i>a on the inside: he thus encloses the food on both sides by the arms.

<span id="v8_4_4_88"><sup><small>8:4:4:88.</small></sup></span>  And those he places in the middle are the body (trunk). He places them on the range of the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (bricks), for—the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle (of the body)—this body is in the middle (of the limbs) [^150]. He places them in every direction, for this body (extends) in every direction. And as to what other (space) there is besides this, that is left over;—and what is left over for the gods, that is these metres;—and as to these <span id="p80"><sup><small>[ p. 80 ]</small></sup></span> metres, they are cattle;—and as to cattle, they are (objects of) good fortune;—and as to these (objects of) good fortune, they are yonder sun: he is that one to the south of them.

<span id="v8_4_4_99"><sup><small>8:4:4:99.</small></sup></span>  Now some lay down these (rows of bricks [^151]) immediately after the two containing the Triv<i>ri</i>t, saying, ‘They are the tongue and the jaws: those fourteen are the jaws, and those six are the tongue.’ Let him not do so: they cause a redundancy,—it would be just as if one were to put two other jaws to the already existing jaws, as if one were to put another tongue to the already existing tongue. That (brick) wherein the head is indeed (includes) the jaws and the tongue.

<span id="v8_4_4_1010"><sup><small>8:4:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  Now some lay down (these bricks) in the intermediate (south-eastern) space of it (the altar) [^152], saying, ‘This is the sun: we thus place yonder sun in that direction.’ Let him not do so: surely there are those other rites [^153] by which he places him in that (direction).

<span id="v8_4_4_1111"><sup><small>8:4:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  Some, again, lay them down on the right <span id="p81"><sup><small>[ p. 81 ]</small></sup></span> (south [^154]) side, saying, ‘We thus place these signs of good fortune (pu<i>n</i>yâ lakshmî) on the right side:’ whence he who has a mark [^155] (lakshman) on his right side is said to have good luck (pu<i>n</i>ya-lakshmîka), and on the left side in the case of a woman [^156]; for the woman has her position on the left side (of the man): therefore it is done thus. But let him place them in front; for where the head is there are also the jaws and the tongue: and thus he places the signs of good fortune at the head (or, in the mouth, mukhata<i>h</i>), whence they say that he who has a (peculiar) mark in his mouth [^157] has good luck.

<span id="v8_4_4_1212"><sup><small>8:4:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  This, indeed, is Brahman's layer: inasmuch as they (the gods) laid down the Brahman [^158], therefore it is Brahman's layer. It is Pra<i>g</i>âpati's layer: inasmuch as they laid down Pra<i>g</i>âpati [^159], it is Pra<i>g</i>âpati's layer. It is the <i>Ri</i>shis’ layer: inasmuch as they laid down the <i>Ri</i>shis [^160], it is the <i>Ri</i>shis’ layer. It is Vâyu's layer: inasmuch as they laid down Vâyu [^161], it is Vâyu's layer. It is the Stomas’ layer: inasmuch as they laid down the hymn-forms [^162], it is the Stomas’ <span id="p82"><sup><small>[ p. 82 ]</small></sup></span> layer. It is the layer of the vital airs: inasmuch as they laid down the vital airs [^163], it is the layer of the vital airs. Hence, whatsoever one may know, that comes to be included in the ancestry, in the kinship [^164] of this layer.—He then lays down two Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs (space-filling bricks) in that corner [^165]: the significance of these (will be explained) farther on [^166]. He throws loose soil thereon: the significance of this (will be explained) farther on [^167].

## Footnotes

[^131]: 59:1 This refers to the first eighteen bricks of the fourth layer; but as the names of the bricks (ish<i>t</i>akâ, f.) are invariably of the feminine gender, it is doubtful whether stoma (m.), in this case, is meant as the designation of these bricks, or merely as their symbolical analogon. In the former case, one would rather, from the analogy of other bricks, expect some such term as ‘stomyâ.’ To the first four of them Mahîdhara, on Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 23, applies the epithet m<i>ri</i>tyumohinî, or ‘confounders of death.’

[^132]: 60:1 See VI, 1, 1, 1; VII, 2, 3, 5.

[^133]: 60:2 See VI, 2, 3, 7. 8.

[^134]: 60:3 These eighteen bricks, representing the Stomas, or hymn-forms, are laid down in the following order. At each end of the spine (running from west to east) one brick, of the size of the shank (from knee to ankle), is placed, with its line-marks running from west to east; the eastern one being placed north, and the western one south, of the spine. Thereupon an ordinary brick, a foot square, is placed p. 61 at the southern end of the ‘cross-spine,’ so as to lie on the spine (though not apparently exactly in the middle, but so that only one-fourth of the brick lies on one side of the spine) with its line-marks running from south to north; and a second brick of the same size is placed on the north, but so as to leave the full space of another such brick between it and the northern edge of the altar. Behind (west of) the front brick, fourteen half-foot bricks are then laid down, in a row from north to south, seven on each side of the spine.

[^135]: 61:1 The formulas of the first four of these (stoma) bricks are not given here (in paragraphs [9](../Book_4_8_4#v8_4_1_9)\-[12](../Book_4_8_4#v8_4_1_12)) in the order in which the bricks are actually laid down, viz. E. W. S. N., but in the order E. S. N. W.; cp. Kâtyây. <i>S</i>rautas. XVII, 10, 6-9. For a symbolic explanation of this change of order see [VIII, 4, 4, 1](../Book_4_8_4#v8_4_4_1) seq.

[^136]: 61:2 Or, perhaps, ‘the angry one.’ The author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, however, evidently connects ‘bhânta’ with the root ‘bhâ,’ to shine.

[^137]: 66:1 For particulars on the <i>K</i>atush<i>t</i>oma, see note on [XIII, 1, 3, 4](../Book_4_8_1#v8_1_3_4).

[^138]: 66:2 The ten Sp<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i> are placed in close connection with the preceding set;—viz. at the front and back ends of the spine, two p. 67 bricks, exactly corresponding in size to those already lying there, are placed south and north of these respectively. Similarly two bricks, a foot square, are placed on the ‘cross-spine’ immediately north of the two stoma-bricks lying there. The remaining six bricks are then placed behind the row of fourteen ‘stomas’ in the front part of the altar, three on each side of the spine.

[^139]: 67:1 Or, from that evil, death.

[^140]: 67:2 In the case of the first four Sp<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i>, as in that of the corresponding Stomas (see p. 6r, note r), while the bricks themselves are laid down in the order E. W. N. S., the order in which the formulas are given in paragraphs 3-6, is that of E. N. S.W.—Cp. Kâty. <i>S</i>rautas. XVII, 10, 11-14. For a symbolical explanation of this change of order, see [VIII, 4, 4, 1](../Book_4_8_4#v8_4_4_1) seq.

[^141]: 69:1 This is clearly a fanciful etymology. If ‘yava’ and ‘ayava,’ in the sense of the bright and dark fortnights, are really genuine terms, it is more likely that they are derived from yu, ‘to keep off,’—the bright half of the moon being looked upon as capable of averting evil spirits, and the dark half as the reverse of this.

[^142]: 70:1 These are placed over the <i>Ri</i>tavyâs of the preceding layers, viz. in the fifth place to the east of the centre, south and north of the spine.

[^143]: 71:1 The seventeen S<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>is are to be placed round the centre, along the reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> range, in such a way that nine bricks lie south (Seventeen s<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i and two <i>ri</i>tavyâ.) and eight bricks north, of the spine; and that five bricks form the southern side, and four bricks each of the three other sides. Whilst the bricks of the south side are further specified as consisting of a brick, a foot square, lying on the cross-spine, being flanked on both sides by half-foot bricks, and these again by square bricks; no particulars are given regarding the other sides. Most likely, however, as indicated in the accompanying sketch, four square bricks, two on each side of the cross-spine, are to form the left (north) side, whilst the front and hind sides are to consist of two p. 72 square bricks lying north and south of the spine, and flanked by half-foot bricks.
  ![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FOURTH LAYER.](/image/book/Hinduism/The_Satapatha_Brahmana/07100.jpg)

[^144]: 72:1 That is, to the deities representing the vital airs, viz. the regions, &c. Mahîdh.

[^145]: 72:2 Professor Delbrück, in his Altindische Syntax, pp. 136, 257, 265, takes ‘stoshyâmahe’ in this passage in a passive sense—‘by whom shall we be praised?’ I think, however, that this is a mistake, and Harisvâmin's commentary certainly takes it in the same sense as I have done; and, indeed, the paragraphs which follow seem to me to make it quite clear that no other interpretation is possible. Pra<i>g</i>âpati is about to perform the ‘s<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>is,’ i. e. the creation of living beings by means of sacrifice (his own self). He requires the assistance of the Prâ<i>n</i>as (vital airs) in order to produce creatures endowed with breath, and he also appeals to (the three most prominent of) them in their capacity as <i>Ri</i>shis (VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.) to officiate as his (Udgât<i>ri</i>) priests. They ask, ‘Wherewith shall we sing praises?’ and he answers, ‘With me and with your own selves.’ The wherewith,' according to Harisvâmin, refers both to the ‘stotriyâ’ verses to be used, and to the deities of the s<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i-stotras. That the former, at all events, is indeed the case, a glance at the subsequent paragraphs shows, where the stotriyâs are identified with the vital airs, and, when their number (ten) becomes exhausted, with parts of the year (Pra<i>g</i>âpati), and of his (the Sacrificer's, or Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) body. As regards the deities whom Harisvâmin considers to be likewise implied, this also is by no means improbable, though I must confess that it did not occur to me, before I looked at the commentary. In the Udgât<i>ri</i>'s text-books, the chanting of stotras is usually interpreted as symbolising the production of ‘food’ (cf., for instance, Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya-Br. I, 3, 6, ‘anna<i>m</i> karishyâmy anna<i>m</i> pravishyâmy anna<i>m</i> <i>g</i>anayishyâmi’), whilst here it seems identified with the production of life, or breath itself (cf. ib. 5, ‘b<i>ri</i>haspatis tvâ yunaktu devebhya<i>h</i> prâ<i>n</i>âya &c.’); and, accordingly, in Sat. Br. X, 3, 1, 1, 7, the principal vital air, the breath proper, is called ‘pra<i>g</i>anana-prâ<i>n</i>a.’

[^146]: 76:1 That is, he makes them pass into his own power, makes them his own.

[^147]: 77:1 That is, in the laying down of these bricks. For the order followed in laying down the bricks, see also [p. 67](../Book_4_8_4#p67), note [2](../Book_4_8_4#fn139).

[^148]: 78:1 The Sanskrit text, as usual, makes our gerundial clause the principal clause: ‘because he lays them down in changing them.’

[^149]: 78:2 On the south side a Sp<i>ri</i>t representing the Saptada<i>s</i>a is placed immediately north of a stoma (brick) representing the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a; and vice versa on the north (left) side.

[^150]: 79:1 Viz. the southern one of the two on the south (right) side, and the northern one of the two on the north (left) side.

[^151]: 79:2 Atha yâ madhya npadadhâti sa âtmâ, tâ reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i>or velayopadadhâti—p<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>ayo vai reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i>au, madhyam u p<i>ri</i>shtayo—madhyato hy ayam âtmâ.—Here the two clauses with ‘vai’ are inserted to substantiate the reason introduced by ‘hi.’

[^152]: 80:1 Viz. the row of fourteen bricks lying behind the two front bricks, and the row of six bricks again placed behind these. It will he remembered that only the northern one of the two front bricks was laid down at first, and that then three others were placed in the different directions, after which the row of fourteen was laid down behind the front one; and similarly the laying down of the second front brick was separated from that of the second row by the laying down of three other bricks in the different quarters.

[^153]: 80:2 In that case, the two shank-sized bricks are laid down in the south-east corner, and the rows of smaller bricks are placed to the north of them. See Kâty. <i>S</i>rautas. XIV, I0, 4.

[^154]: 80:3 See, for instance, VI, 7, 3, 9 where the Ukhya Agni, representing the sun, is held up by the Agni<i>k</i>it (sacrificer) in the south-easterly direction. The south-east corner is sacred to Agni.

[^155]: 81:1 In that case, they are laid down north of the two bricks lying on the southern end of the cross-spine, first the row of fourteen, and then, north of these, the row of six.

[^156]: 81:2 Yasya dakshi<i>n</i>apâr<i>s</i>ve laksha<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> kâyasya vâ var<i>n</i>e vâ ki<i>m</i>tarâtmaka<i>m</i> (?) bhavati; comm.
