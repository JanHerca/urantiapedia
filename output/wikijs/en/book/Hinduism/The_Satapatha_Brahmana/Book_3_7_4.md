### THE BUILDING OF THE ALTAR.

### THE FIRST LAYER.

## FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v7_4_1_11"><sup><small>7:4:1:11.</small></sup></span>  Being about to build Agni (the fire-altar), he takes him up into his own self; for from out of his own self he causes him to be born, and wherefrom one is born, suchlike he becomes. Now were he to build up Agni without taking him up into his own self, he would beget man from man, mortal from mortal, one not freed from sin from one not freed from sin; but when he builds up Agni after taking him up into his own self, he causes Agni to be born from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless from the sinless.

<span id="v7_4_1_22"><sup><small>7:4:1:22.</small></sup></span>  He takes him in (by muttering, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. X III, 1), ‘Within me I first take Agni,’ he thereby first takes Agni into his own self;—‘for increase of wealth, for healthy progeny, for vigorous manhood!’ and hereby he takes all blessings to himself;—‘and may the deities stand by me!’ and hereby he takes all the gods to himself; and thus he takes into his own self all that he is about to generate from his own self. Having taken Agni <span id="p363">[<sup><small>p. 363</small></sup>]</span> into his own self whilst standing, he builds him up sitting;—Agni is an animal: hence the animal, having received the foetus standing, gives birth after lying down.

<span id="v7_4_1_33"><sup><small>7:4:1:33.</small></sup></span>  He now sings the Satya Sâman [^678] (true hymn). For the gods then said, ‘Let us make the truth (satya) his mouth (or beginning): thus we shall become the truth, truth will turn unto us, and true will become that wish of ours for which we are about to perform this rite!’

<span id="v7_4_1_44"><sup><small>7:4:1:44.</small></sup></span>  They sang that ‘true hymn’ at the outset, and thus made the truth his (Agni's) mouth; and they became the truth; the truth turned unto them, and true became that wish of theirs for which they performed this rite.

<span id="v7_4_1_55"><sup><small>7:4:1:55.</small></sup></span>  And in like manner when the Sacrificer now, at the outset, sings the ‘true hymn,’ he thereby makes the truth his (Agni's) mouth; and he (himself) becomes the truth; and truth turns unto him; and true becomes that wish of his for which he performs this rite.

<span id="v7_4_1_66"><sup><small>7:4:1:66.</small></sup></span>  Now that truth is the same as the waters, for the waters are the truth. Hence they say, ‘Whereby [^679] the waters flow, that is a form of the truth.’ It is the waters indeed that were made first of this universe: hence when the waters (rains) flow, then everything whatsoever exists is produced here.

<span id="v7_4_1_77"><sup><small>7:4:1:77.</small></sup></span>  He then puts down a lotus-leaf (in the centre of <span id="p364">[<sup><small>p. 364</small></sup>]</span> the altar-site);—the lotus-leaf is a womb: he hereby puts a womb to it (for Agni to be born from).

<span id="v7_4_1_88"><sup><small>7:4:1:88.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts down a lotus-leaf;—the lotus means the waters, and this earth is a leaf thereof: even as the lotus-leaf here lies spread on the water, so this earth lies spread on the waters. Now this same earth is Agni's womb, for Agni (the fire-altar) is this earth, since thereof the whole Agni is built up: it is this earth he thus lays down. He lays it down so as not to be separated from the truth: he thereby establishes this earth on the truth;—hence this earth is established on the truth; and hence the truth is this earth, for this earth is the most certain of these worlds.

<span id="v7_4_1_99"><sup><small>7:4:1:99.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays it down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 2\] ‘The waters’ back thou art, the womb of Agni,’ for this earth is indeed the back of the waters, and the womb of Agni;—‘around the swelling ocean,’ for the ocean indeed swells around this earth;—‘growing great on the lotus,’ that is, ‘growing, flourish thou on the lotus;’—‘spread out with the extent, with the breadth, of the sky!’ with this he strokes along (the leaf),—for this Agni is yonder sun, and no other extent but that of the sky is able to contain him: he thus says (to the leaf), Having become the sky, contain him! He lays it down with a Svarâ<i>g</i> verse, for self-rule (svârâ<i>g</i>ya) belongs to the waters. Having ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas [^680] upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_4_1_1010"><sup><small>7:4:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then puts the gold plate [^681] thereon. Now <span id="p365">[<sup><small>p. 365</small></sup>]</span> this gold plate is yonder sun, for he shines over all the creatures here on earth; and ‘ro<i>k</i>as’ (shine) they mystically call ‘rukma’ (gold plate), for the gods love the mystic: he thus lays down yonder sun (on the altar). It is golden, and round, with one and twenty knobs,—the significance of this has been explained. He puts it down with the knobs pointing downward; for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays (shine) downwards.

<span id="v7_4_1_1111"><sup><small>7:4:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  He puts it down on the lotus-leaf;—the lotus-leaf is a womb: in the womb he thus places him (Agni).

<span id="v7_4_1_1212"><sup><small>7:4:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf;—the lotus-leaf is a foundation, for the lotus-leaf is this earth, and this earth is the foundation: he who is not settled on this earth, is unsettled even as one who is far away. Now by means of his rays that (sun) is settled on this earth: he thus settles him (Agni) on this earth, as his foundation.

<span id="v7_4_1_1313"><sup><small>7:4:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf. When Indra had smitten V<i>ri</i>tra, he, thinking that he had not laid him low, entered the waters. He said to them, ‘I am afraid: make ye a stronghold for me!’ Now what essence of the waters there was that they gathered upwards (on the surface), and made it a stronghold for him; and because they made (kar) a stronghold (pû<i>h</i>) for him, therefore it is ‘pûshkara;’ ‘pûshkara’ being what is mystically called ‘push-kara’ (lotus-leaf), for the gods love the mystic. Now when he puts it (the gold plate) on the lotus-leaf, he then establishes him (Agni) in that essence which the waters gathered together for him (Indra), and in that stronghold which they made for him.

<span id="v7_4_1_1414"><sup><small>7:4:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  \[He puts it down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 3\] <span id="p366">[<sup><small>p. 366</small></sup>]</span> ‘The Brahman first born in front;’ the Brahman doubtless is yonder sun, and he is born day by day in front (in the east);—‘from the summit [^682] he, the longing, overspread the shining,’ the summit doubtless is the middle, the shining ones are these worlds, and the longing one is yonder sun,—he is the longing one inasmuch as he longed to be born; and in rising he overspreads [^683] these (worlds) from the summit, from the middle;—‘he (overspread) the nighest extents of the deep,’ his nighest extents of the deep doubtless are the regions, for he (the sun) does extend nigh to them;—‘the womb of the existent and of the non-existent did he overspread!’ the womb of the existent and of the non-existent doubtless are these worlds; for both what exists and what does not exist is born from these worlds. He puts it on with a trish<i>t</i>ubh verse, for yonder (sun) is related to the Trish<i>t</i>ubh [^684]. Having ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas [^685] verse upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_4_1_1515"><sup><small>7:4:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  He then lays the (gold) man thereon,—he is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, he is Agni, he is the Sacrificer. He is made of gold, for gold is light, and fire is light; gold is immortality, and fire is immortality. It is a man (purusha), for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the Man. <span id="p367">[<sup><small>p. 367</small></sup>]</span> 7:4:1:1616\. And, again, why he lays down the man. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was relaxed, his pleasing form went out from within; when it had gone out of him, the gods left him. When the gods restored him, they put that pleasing form into him, and the gods were pleased with that (form) of his; and inasmuch as the gods were pleased (ram) with that pleasing (ramya) form of his, it is called ‘hiramya;’ ‘hiramya’ being what is mystically called ‘hira<i>n</i>ya’ (gold), for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put that pleasing form into him (Agni), and the gods are pleased with that (form) of his. But that pleasing form of his is the vital air: it is that vital air he thus puts into him.

<span id="v7_4_1_1717"><sup><small>7:4:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  He lays him on the gold plate, for the gold plate is yonder sun: that same man who is in that (sun's) disk, it is him he now lays down (on the altar).

<span id="v7_4_1_1818"><sup><small>7:4:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  He lays him down on his back [^686];—for the gods at that time said, ‘If we lay down these two [^687] both looking hitherwards, they will burn up everything here; and if (we lay) both so as to be turned away from here, they will give warmth only in the opposite direction; and if facing each other, then there will be light only between those two, and they will injure each other.’ They laid down the one so as to look hitherwards, and the other so as to look away from here: that one (the sun), the gold disk, looking downwards, gives warmth by his rays, and <span id="p368">[<sup><small>p. 368</small></sup>]</span> that man (tends) upward by his vital airs [^688]. He lays him down (with the head) towards the east, for (with the head) towards the east this Agni (the fire-altar) is built up.

<span id="v7_4_1_1919"><sup><small>7:4:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays him down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 4; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 121, 1\] ‘Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha came first into existence,’ for that golden child did come first into existence;—‘born he was the one lord of being;’ for he indeed was born as the one lord of all this being;—‘he upholdeth this earth and the sky,’ for he (the sun) does uphold both the sky and the earth;—‘to the god Ka let us do homage by offering!’ Ka (Who?) is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: thus, ‘let us do homage to Him by offering!’

<span id="v7_4_1_2020"><sup><small>7:4:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 5; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 17, 11\] ‘The drop leaped along the earth and sky;’ the drop is yonder sun, and he leaps both to the sky and to the earth—thus (in rising) to that (sky), and thus (in setting) to this (earth);—‘along this seat, and that which was afore;’ that is, to this world, and to that one; or this (Âhavanîya altar) which is now being built, and that (Gârhapatya altar) which yonder was built before;—‘(the drop) moving along the common seat;’ for he (the sun) moves along that common seat;—‘the drop I offer along the seven hotrâs;’ the drop is yonder sun; and the seven hotrâs are the regions: he thus establishes yonder sun in the regions.

<span id="v7_4_1_2121"><sup><small>7:4:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  With two (verses) he lays him down;—two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays him down;—with two trish<i>t</i>ubh <span id="p369">[<sup><small>p. 369</small></sup>]</span> verses, for he (the sun) is related to the Trish<i>t</i>ubh. Having ‘settled’ him, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on him: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_4_1_2222"><sup><small>7:4:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  He then sings a Sâman. For the gods, having laid down that man, then saw him (looking) even suchlike as yonder dry plank.

<span id="v7_4_1_2323"><sup><small>7:4:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Think ye upon this, how we may put vigour into this man!’ They said, ‘Meditate ye (<i>k</i>etay)!’ whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, ‘Seek ye to build up (<i>k</i>itim ish)! seek ye how we shall put vigour into this man!’

<span id="v7_4_1_2424"><sup><small>7:4:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  Whilst meditating, they saw this Sâman, and sang it, and thereby put vigour into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put it into him: he sings on the man, he puts vigour into the man;—he sings on the bright one [^689], for Agni is all bright things. After he has laid him down, let him not walk round him in front, lest that Agni should injure him.

<span id="v7_4_1_2525"><sup><small>7:4:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  He (the Sacrificer) then stands by (the gold man) worshipping him with the Sarpanâma (serpent-named) formulas. The serpents doubtless are these worlds, for these glide along (sarp) with everything here whatsoever there is; and Agni is no other than the self (body) of all the gods. They, the gods, having laid down (on the altar) that self of theirs, were afraid lest these worlds should glide away with that self of theirs.

<span id="v7_4_1_2626"><sup><small>7:4:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  They saw those Sarpanâma and worshipped with them; by these (verses) they stopped these worlds for him, and caused them to bend themselves; and because they caused them to bend (nam) themselves, <span id="p370">[<sup><small>p. 370</small></sup>]</span> therefore (the formulas are called) Sarpanâma. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanâma formulas, stop these worlds for him, and cause these worlds to bend themselves; and so they do not glide away with that self of his.

<span id="v7_4_1_2727"><sup><small>7:4:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanâma formulas;—the serpents are these worlds, for whatever creeps (sarp), creeps in these worlds. Now when he worships with the Sarpanâma formulas—whatever fiend there is in these worlds, whatever devourer, whatever ogress,—all that he thereby appeases.

<span id="v7_4_1_2828"><sup><small>7:4:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 6-8\] ‘Homage be to the serpents, whichever are on earth, and they that are in the air, and they that are in the sky, to those serpents be homage!’ whatever serpents there are in these three worlds to them he thereby does homage.

<span id="v7_4_1_2929"><sup><small>7:4:1:2929.</small></sup></span>  ‘They that are the darts of demons,’ for some (of the serpents), sent by demons, bite;—‘and those on the trees, and those which lie in holes, to those serpents be homage!’ he thereby does homage to the serpents that lie both in trees, and in holes.

<span id="v7_4_1_3030"><sup><small>7:4:1:3030.</small></sup></span>  ‘Or those that are in the luminous sphere of the sky; or those in the rays of the sun; those by which abode is made in the waters, to those serpents be homage!’ he hereby does homage to them wheresoever they are. He does so by ‘homage, homage,’ for homage is sacrifice (worship): by sacrifice, by homage, he thus worships them. Let him therefore not say ‘homage be to thee,’ to one not worthy of sacrifice, for it <span id="p371">[<sup><small>p. 371</small></sup>]</span> would be just as if he said ‘sacrifice (or, worship) be to thee!’

<span id="v7_4_1_3131"><sup><small>7:4:1:3131.</small></sup></span>  With three (formulas) he worships,—three are these worlds, and threefold, also, is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus stops these worlds (from moving); and by so much does he appease everything here. Standing he worships, for these worlds stand, as it were; and besides, while standing one is stronger.

<span id="v7_4_1_3232"><sup><small>7:4:1:3232.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon, having sat down he offers on (the gold man) with fivefold-taken ghee,—the significance of this has been explained. On each side (of the fire he offers), moving round: he thus gratifies him (Agni) with food from all quarters.

<span id="v7_4_1_3333"><sup><small>7:4:1:3333.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he offers thereon. The gods, having laid down that body of theirs, now were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite that (body) of theirs. They saw those Rakshas-killing counter-charms [^690],—(Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 9-13; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 4, I-5), <span id="p372">[<sup><small>p. 372</small></sup>]</span> ‘Put forth thy power, like a broad army!’ slayers of Rakshas are the counter-charms: having, by means of these counter-charms, repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, in every quarter, they (the gods) restored that body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in like manner this Sacrificer, having, by means of these counter-charms, repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, in every quarter, now restores that body (of Agni) in a place free from danger and devilry.

<span id="v7_4_1_3434"><sup><small>7:4:1:3434.</small></sup></span>  He offers with ghee; for the ghee is a thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;—with fivefold-taken (ghee),—of five layers consists the fire-altar; five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;—with (five) verses addressed to Agni, for the Rakshas-killing light is Agni: by Agni he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;—with trish<i>t</i>ubh verses,—the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is a thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends. On each side (he offers) moving round: in every quarter he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends.

<span id="v7_4_1_3535"><sup><small>7:4:1:3535.</small></sup></span>  Behind the altar (he offers) while seated with his face towards the east; then on the left (north) side (looking) to the south; then in front (looking) to the west; then going round behind, (he offers) on the right (south) side while sitting with his face towards the north. Thus (he moves) to the right, for <span id="p373">[<sup><small>p. 373</small></sup>]</span> that (leads) to the gods. Thereupon, going back, (he offers) while sitting behind, with his face towards the east; and in this way that performance of his takes place towards the east [^691].

<span id="v7_4_1_3636"><sup><small>7:4:1:3636.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down two offering-spoons,—the offering-spoons are arms [^692]: it is his arms he thus restores to him (Agni). And as to why offering-spoons (are laid down), it is because the arms are offering-spoons,—that bowl and the handle are two, for there are two of these arms. He lays them down at the (left and right) sides, for these arms (of ours) are at the sides.

<span id="v7_4_1_3737"><sup><small>7:4:1:3737.</small></sup></span>  On the right (south) side he lays down one of kârshmarya (gmelina arborea) wood. For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should destroy their sacrifice from the south. They saw that Rakshas-killing tree, the Kârshmarya: having by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, they spread that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. And in like manner the Sacrificer, having by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, now spreads that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. It (the spoon) is filled with ghee;—the ghee is a thunderbolt: it is by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south.

<span id="v7_4_1_3838"><sup><small>7:4:1:3838.</small></sup></span>  On the left (north) side he then lays down one of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood; for the Udumbara means strength, life-sap: strength, life-sap he thus puts into him. It is filled with sour <span id="p374">[<sup><small>p. 374</small></sup>]</span> curds,—sour curds are life-sap: it is life-sap he thus puts into him.

<span id="v7_4_1_3939"><sup><small>7:4:1:3939.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he lays down two offering-spoons. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was relaxed, Agni took his (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) fiery spirit, and carried it off to the south, and there stopped; and because after carrying (karsh) it off he stopped (ud-ram), therefore the Kârshmarya (sprang up). And Indra took his (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) vigour and went away to the north: it became the Udumbara tree.

<span id="v7_4_1_4040"><sup><small>7:4:1:4040.</small></sup></span>  He (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) said to those two, ‘Come ye to me, and put back into me that (substance) of mine wherewith ye have gone off!’—‘Well then, bestow thou all food here on us two!’ they said.—‘Well then, join me, becoming these two arms of mine!’—‘So be it!’ He bestowed all food on them, and they joined him, becoming those two arms of his: hence it is by the arms that food is made, and by means of the arms that it is eaten, for he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) bestowed all food on the two arms.

<span id="v7_4_1_4141"><sup><small>7:4:1:4141.</small></sup></span>  The kârshmarya one he lays down on the right side, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 13), 'By Agni's fiery spirit I settle thee!'—that fiery spirit of his (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) which Agni then took and carried off to the south, he now puts back into him.—‘Agni, the head, the summit of the sky, he, the lord of the earth, animates the seeds of the waters,’ for Agni indeed is this (spoon). With a Gâyatrî verse (he performs),—Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays down that (spoon). It is filled with ghee, for ghee belongs to Agni: with his own share, with his own life-sap he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v7_4_1_4242"><sup><small>7:4:1:4242.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down the udumbara one on the <span id="p375">[<sup><small>p. 375</small></sup>]</span> left (north) side, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 14), 'By Indra's vigour I settle thee!' that vigour of his (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) which Indra then took and went away to the north, he now puts back into him.—(Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 15; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 8, 6), ‘Thou hast become the leader of the sacrifice, and of the sphere to which thou tendest with propitious teams; the light-giving head hast thou lifted to the sky; thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering;’—Indra indeed is this (spoon). And as to its being a verse addressed to Agni, it is because it is the performance of Agni (the fire-altar);—and a trish<i>t</i>ubh one, because Indra is connected with the Trish<i>t</i>ubh; and Agni includes Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down. Moreover, all the gods are Indra and Agni, and Agni belongs to all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down. It is filled with sour curds, for sour curds belong to Indra: with his own share, with his own life-sap he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v7_4_1_4343"><sup><small>7:4:1:4343.</small></sup></span>  Indra and Agni indeed are those two arms of his (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's): they join him with fiery spirit and vigour. Where he (the Sacrificer) touches (the ground with his arms), whilst viewing intently the gold man with his breast close to him [^693], there he <span id="p376">[<sup><small>p. 376</small></sup>]</span> (the Adhvaryu) makes a mark and lays down those (spoons); for that is the place of those two (arms).

<span id="v7_4_1_4444"><sup><small>7:4:1:4444.</small></sup></span>  Now some lay them down sideways (from south to north), saying, ‘Sideways run these two arms (of ours).’ Let him not do so, but let him lay them with the bowl towards the front (east), for this Agni (altar) is built with the head towards the front; and, besides, in this way the arms are stronger. Separately he lays them down, separately he ‘settles’ them, and separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas verse on them; for separate are these two arms.

<span id="v7_4_1_4545"><sup><small>7:4:1:4545.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘Let him make no arms to this (gold) man [^694], lest he should cause him to be redundant; for these two spoons are (in lieu of) his arms.’ Let him nevertheless make (him with arms), for those two spoons are (merely) after the manner of the two arms. Moreover, those two (arms of Agni) are wings; and whatever forms, whatever stomas, whatever p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as, whatever metres he will be applying to that fire-altar, that will be the perfection, that will be the growth of those two: let him therefore make arms to that (gold) man.

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v7_4_2_11"><sup><small>7:4:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He puts a Svayam-ât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â (naturally-perforated brick) on (the gold man);—the (first) naturally-perforated one being this earth, he thus puts this earth thereon. He puts it on so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one means food, and the naturally-perforated one means this earth, and this earth is food, since it is on her that all food ripens: he thus places food close to him (the man, Agni). Upon (the man he puts it): he thus places the food upon him [^695].

<span id="v7_4_2_22"><sup><small>7:4:2:22.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts on a naturally-perforated one;—the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath (or vital air), for the breath thus bores itself (svayam ât<i>ri</i>ntte) through the body: it is breath he thus bestows on it. He puts it so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one is the breath, and the naturally-perforated one is this earth, and this earth is the breath, since this earth bears everything that breathes: he thus puts the breath so as not to be separate from him. Upon (the man he places the brick): he thus puts the breath upon him [^695].

<span id="v7_4_2_33"><sup><small>7:4:2:33.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts thereon the naturally-perforated one. The deities, taking up the disjointed Pra<i>g</i>âpati, separated; and, having obtained a resting-place in them, thus separated, he settled down.

<span id="v7_4_2_44"><sup><small>7:4:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Now that Pra<i>g</i>âpati who became disjointed is this very Agni (fire-altar) that is now being built up; and that resting-place (or, foundation) is this first <span id="p378">[<sup><small>p. 378</small></sup>]</span> naturally-perforated (brick);—thus when he now puts it on, he thereby puts upon this (altar-site) that (foundation [^696]) which there was for his body: that is why he now puts it on.

<span id="v7_4_2_55"><sup><small>7:4:2:55.</small></sup></span>  He puts it on by means of Pra<i>g</i>âpati, for Pra<i>g</i>âpati thereby took back to himself (that foundation) of his body. \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 16\] ‘Steady thou art,’ that is, ‘Firm thou art, or established thou art;’—‘supporting,’ for that which supports is a foundation;—‘laid down by Vi<i>s</i>vakarman;’ Vi<i>s</i>vakarman is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, thus, ‘laid down by that one;’—‘May the ocean, may the bird not injure thee!’ the ocean doubtless is the gold plate, and the bird is the man: thus, ‘May those two not injure thee!’—‘Not shaking, steady thou the earth!’ as the text, so the meaning.

<span id="v7_4_2_66"><sup><small>7:4:2:66.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 17\] ‘May Pra<i>g</i>âpati settle thee’—for Pra<i>g</i>âpati saw this first layer [^697];—‘on the back of the waters, on the way of the ocean,’ the back of the waters doubtless is this earth, and the way of the ocean is this earth;—‘thee, the wide, the broad one!’ for this earth is both wide and broad;—‘broaden thou: thou art the broad one!’ that is, ‘broaden thou, and thou art the broad (earth, p<i>ri</i>thivî).’

<span id="v7_4_2_77"><sup><small>7:4:2:77.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 18\] ‘Thou art the earth (bhû),’ for this is the earth;—‘thou art the ground (bhûmi),’ for this is the ground;—‘Thou art Aditi,’—Aditi is this earth, for this earth gives (dad) <span id="p379">[<sup><small>p. 379</small></sup>]</span> everything here;—‘the all-containing,’ for on this earth everything is contained;—‘supporter of all the world,’ that is, supporter of the whole world;—‘sustain the earth, steady the earth, injure not the earth!’ that is, sustain thyself, steady thyself, injure, not thyself!

<span id="v7_4_2_88"><sup><small>7:4:2:88.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 19\] ‘For all breathing, out-breathing, through-breathing, and up-breathing;’ for the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath, and the breath serves for all that;—‘for a resting-place, for a moving-place;’ the naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds [^698], and these worlds are the resting-place, the moving-place;—‘May Agni guard thee’—that is, may Agni protect thee!—‘with mighty well-being!’ that is, with great well-being;—‘with the safest roof,’ that is, with whatever roof (abode) is the safest. Having ‘settled’ it [^699], he pronounces the Sûdadohas [^700] on it: the meaning of this has been explained. He then sings a Sâman: the meaning of this (will be explained) further on.

<span id="v7_4_2_99"><sup><small>7:4:2:99.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say, ‘How is it that that (gold) man is not held (weighed) down by the naturally-perforated (brick) [^701]?’ Well, the naturally-perforated (brick) is food and breath; and man is not held down either by food or by his breath.

<span id="v7_4_2_1010"><sup><small>7:4:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then lays the Darya-brick [^702] thereon;—the Dûrvâ-brick being cattle; it is with cattle he <span id="p380">[<sup><small>p. 380</small></sup>]</span> thus endows it: these are the same cattle together with which Agni on that former occasion approached [^703]; it is them he now puts thereon. He lays it down immediately on the naturally-perforated (brick); the naturally-perforated (brick) being this earth, he thus places the cattle immediately on this earth. Upon (the brick he places it): upon this earth he thereby places cattle.

<span id="v7_4_2_1111"><sup><small>7:4:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he lays down the Dûrvâ-brick. The hair of Pra<i>g</i>âpati which were lying on the ground when he was disjointed became these herbs. The vital air then went out from within him, and, that having gone out, he fell down.

<span id="v7_4_2_1212"><sup><small>7:4:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  He said, ‘Verily, this (vital air) has undone me!’ and because he said, ‘it has undone (dhûrv) me,’ hence (the name) ‘dhûrvâ;’ ‘dhûrvâ’ doubtless being what is mystically called ‘dûrvâ,’ for the gods love the mystic. That (dûrvâ grass) is the ruling power (Kshatra), for it is this vital sap, the breath; and the other plants are the hair: in laying down that (dûrvâ plant) he lays down all (kinds of) plants.

<span id="v7_4_2_1313"><sup><small>7:4:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  When the gods restored him, they put that life-sap, the breath, inside him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put it into him. He lays it down immediately on the naturally-perforated (brick); the naturally-perforated one being this earth, he thus places the plants immediately on this earth. Upon (the brick he lays it): upon this earth he thus places the plants. It should be with root and top, for completeness' sake. Let him lay it on in such manner that while lying on the naturally-perforated (brick) it touches the ground (with its <span id="p381">[<sup><small>p. 381</small></sup>]</span> tops) [^704], for on this earth those (plants) spring up, and along her they grow.

<span id="v7_4_2_1414"><sup><small>7:4:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  He lays it on, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 20-21), ‘Growing up joint by joint, knot by knot;’ for joint by joint, and knot by knot that (grass) does grow up;—‘so do thou prolong us, O Dûrvâ (plant), by a thousand, and a hundred (descendants)!’ as the text, so its meaning.

<span id="v7_4_2_1515"><sup><small>7:4:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  ‘Thou that spreadest by a hundred, and branchest out by a thousand (shoots);’ for by a hundred (shoots) it spreads, and by a thousand it branches out;—‘to thee, O divine brick, we will do homage by offering;’ as the text, so the meaning. With two (verses) he puts it on: the meaning of this has been explained. Having ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the meaning of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_4_2_1616"><sup><small>7:4:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  He then puts down a Dviya<i>g</i>us [^705] (brick). Indra and Agni desired, ‘May we go to the heavenly world!’ They saw that dviya<i>g</i>us brick, even this earth, and laid it down; and having laid it down, they went to the heavenly world from that foundation. In like manner when this Sacrificer lays down a dviya<i>g</i>us (brick), (he does so) thinking, ‘I want to go to the heavenly world by the same means (rûpa), by performing the same rite by which Indra and Agni went to the heavenly world!’ And as to its being called ‘dviya<i>g</i>us,’ it is because two deities saw it. And as to why he lays down a dviya<i>g</i>us one: the dviya<i>g</i>us doubtless is the Sacrificer. <span id="p382">[<sup><small>p. 382</small></sup>]</span> 7:4:2:1717\. Here now they say, ‘If (the dviya<i>g</i>us) is that same Sacrificer who is that gold man, which then is that (real) form of his?’ Well, that (gold man) is his divine body, and this (brick) is his human one. As to that gold man, that is his immortal form, his divine form; gold being immortal. And as to this (brick) being made of clay, it is because this is his human form.

<span id="v7_4_2_1818"><sup><small>7:4:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  Now were he only to lay down that (golden man), and not to let this dviya<i>g</i>us (brick) remain [^706], the Sacrificer surely would quickly pass away from this world; but now that he allows this (brick) to remain, he thereby leaves to him this human form of his; and so he attains with this body the full (measure of) life.

<span id="v7_4_2_1919"><sup><small>7:4:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  And were he not to put it on after (the gold man), he assuredly would not afterwards find out that divine body [^707]; but now that he puts it on thereafter, he does so afterwards find out that divine body. He lays it down close to the dûrvâ-brick the dûrvâ-brick being cattle, he thus establishes the Sacrificer in (the possession of) cattle.

<span id="v7_4_2_2020"><sup><small>7:4:2:2020.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say, ‘How do those two bodies of his come to be connected together by the breath, and not severed?’ Well, the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath, and the dûrvâ-brick is the breath, and the dviya<i>g</i>us (-brick) is the Sacrificer: <span id="p383">[<sup><small>p. 383</small></sup>]</span> and inasmuch as he lays down the dûrvâ-brick close to the naturally-perforated one, he thereby connects and joins breath with breath; and inasmuch as he lays down the dviya<i>g</i>us one close to the dûrvâ-brick—the dûrvâ-brick being the breath, and the dviya<i>g</i>us the Sacrificer—those two bodies of his (the human one and the divine one) thus become connected together by the breath, and not severed.

<span id="v7_4_2_2121"><sup><small>7:4:2:2121.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays down the dviya<i>g</i>us brick, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 22, 23\] ‘O Agni, what lights of thine in the sun overspread the sky by their beams, with all those help us to light and to people!—O ye gods, what lights of yours are in the sun, and what lights are in kine and horses, O Indra and Agni, with all those bestow light upon us, O B<i>ri</i>haspati!’ for ‘light’ he prays each time: light being immortality, it is immortality he thus bestows on him (Agni, and the Sacrificer). With two (verses) he lays it down: the significance of this has been explained. And, moreover, it is because that material form (of the brick) is a twofold one, (consisting as it does of) clay and water. Having ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_4_2_2222"><sup><small>7:4:2:2222.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down two Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (seed-shedding bricks);—the seed-shedders doubtless are these two worlds, for these two worlds do shed seed;—this (terrestrial world) sheds seed upwards from here (in the form of) smoke; it becomes rain in yonder world, and that rain yonder world (sheds) from above: hence (creatures) are born within these two worlds, and therefore these two worlds are seed-shedders.

<span id="v7_4_2_2323"><sup><small>7:4:2:2323.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays them down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 24\] <span id="p384">[<sup><small>p. 384</small></sup>]</span> ‘The wide-ruling one contained the light;’ the wide-ruling ones doubtless is this (terrestrial) world: it contains this fire, the light.—‘The self-ruling one contained the light,’ the self-ruling [^708] one doubtless is yonder world: it contains yonder sun, the light. And the wide-ruling one and the self-ruling one being these two worlds, he lays them down separately, for separate are these two worlds. He ‘settles’ them once: he thereby makes them one and the same (or, joined together), whence the ends of these two worlds meet.

<span id="v7_4_2_2424"><sup><small>7:4:2:2424.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he lays down two seed-shedders; the seed-shedders are the testicles, for only he who has testicles sheds seed. ‘The wide-ruling one contained the light;—the self-ruling one contained the light,’ he says; for the wide-ruling and the self-ruling ones are the testicles: they contain that light, the seed, Pra<i>g</i>âpati. He lays them down separately, for separate are these testicles. He ‘settles’ them once: he thereby makes them one and the same, whence they have a common connecting-part. He lays them down close to the dviya<i>g</i>us (brick) [^709]: the dviya<i>g</i>us being the Sacrificer, he thus puts the testicles together with the Sacrificer.

<span id="v7_4_2_2525"><sup><small>7:4:2:2525.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down a Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis (all-light brick) [^710];—the first ‘all-light’ (brick) [^711] is Agni, for Agni <span id="p385">[<sup><small>p. 385</small></sup>]</span> is all the light in this (terrestrial) world: it is Agni he thus lays down. He lays it down close to the seed-shedding ones,—the seed-shedding ones being these two worlds, he thus places Agni together with these two worlds. He lays it down between (the two Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> [^712]), for Agni (the fire) is within these two worlds.

<span id="v7_4_2_2626"><sup><small>7:4:2:2626.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he lays down an ‘all-light’ (brick);—the ‘all-light’ (brick) is progeny, for progeny is all the light: he thus lays generative power (into Agni). He lays it down so as not to be separated from the seed-shedding (bricks),—the seed-shedders being the testicles, he thus makes the generative power inseparable from the testicles. He lays it down between (those two), for within the testicles progeny is produced.

<span id="v7_4_2_2727"><sup><small>7:4:2:2727.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays it down, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 24\] ‘May Pra<i>g</i>âpati settle thee’—for Pra<i>g</i>âpati saw this first layer [^713];—‘on the back of the earth, thee the brilliant one!’ for on the back of the earth this brilliant Agni indeed is.

<span id="v7_4_2_2828"><sup><small>7:4:2:2828.</small></sup></span>  ‘For all breathing, out-breathing, through-breathing,’—the all-light (brick) is breath, and breath is (necessary) for this entire universe;—‘give all the light!’ that is, ‘give the whole light;’—‘Agni is thine over-lord,’ he thus makes Agni the over-lord of this earth. Having ‘settled’ it [^714], he <span id="p386">[<sup><small>p. 386</small></sup>]</span> pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_4_2_2929"><sup><small>7:4:2:2929.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down two <i>Ri</i>tavya (seasonal bricks);—the two seasonal (bricks) being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus lays down. \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 25\] ‘Madhu and Mâdhava, the two spring seasons,’—these are the names of those two: it is thus by their names that he lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for two months are a season. He ‘settles’ them once [^715]: he thereby makes (the two months) one season.

<span id="v7_4_2_3030"><sup><small>7:4:2:3030.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he now lays down these two;—this Agni (fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds; the first layer is this (terrestrial) world thereof, and the spring season also is this world thereof; and when he now lays down those two (bricks), he thereby puts back into him (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati) what those two (the first layer and the spring) are to that body of his [^716]: this is why he now lays down those two (bricks).

<span id="v7_4_2_3131"><sup><small>7:4:2:3131.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he now lays down these two;—this Agni is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year; the first layer is his foundation, and the spring season also is his foundation;—thus when he now lays down these two (bricks), he thereby puts back into him what those two are to that body of his: this is why he now lays down those two (bricks). He lays them down close to the ‘all-light’ brick: the ‘all-light’ brick being progeny, he thus lays progeny close together with the seasons; whence progeny is produced in accordance with the seasons, for by seasons people compute (the age of man) <span id="p387">[<sup><small>p. 387</small></sup>]</span> whilst in the state of embryo, and by seasons when he is born.

<span id="v7_4_2_3232"><sup><small>7:4:2:3232.</small></sup></span>  He then lays down the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â (invincible brick) [^717],—the ‘invincible one’ being this earth, it is this earth he thus lays down. He puts it on the fore-part (of the altar-site), for this earth was created first.

<span id="v7_4_2_3333"><sup><small>7:4:2:3333.</small></sup></span>  And as to its being called Ashâ<i>dh</i>â. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, strove together. The gods saw this invincible brick, even this earth; they put it on (the altar); and having put it on, they conquered (and drove) the Asuras, the enemies, the rivals, from this universe; and inasmuch as (thereby) they conquered (asahanta), it is called Ashâ<i>dh</i>â. In like manner the Sacrificer, after putting on that (brick), conquers (and drives) his spiteful rival from this universe (or, from everything here).

<span id="v7_4_2_3434"><sup><small>7:4:2:3434.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he lays down the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â. The Ashâ<i>dh</i>â is speech, and by speech [^718] the gods then indeed conquered (and drove) the Asuras, the enemies, the rivals, from this universe; and in like manner the Sacrificer, by means of speech, conquers (and drives) his spiteful rival from this universe: it was speech the gods then laid down (or bestowed on Agni), and in like manner the Sacrificer now lays down speech.

<span id="v7_4_2_3535"><sup><small>7:4:2:3535.</small></sup></span>  This earth is the bearer of what is desirable; for—the desirable being the vital airs—this earth bears everything that breathes, and for that reason this earth is the bearer of what is desirable. But <span id="p388">[<sup><small>p. 388</small></sup>]</span> speech (the mouth) also indeed is the bearer of what is desirable; for the desirable is the vital airs, and for the (channels of) the vital airs food is put into the mouth: therefore speech is the bearer of what is desirable.

<span id="v7_4_2_3636"><sup><small>7:4:2:3636.</small></sup></span>  Now the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â is the same as those vital airs; he lays it down in the fore-part (of the altar): he thus bestows (on Agni the organs of) the vital airs in front; whence there are here (organs of) the vital airs in front (of the body). Let him not in this layer enclose this (Ashâ<i>dh</i>â) in front by any other brick which has a special prayer of its own, lest he close up (the organs of) the vital airs.

<span id="v7_4_2_3737"><sup><small>7:4:2:3737.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he lays down in front five Apasyâs [^719],—water (ap) is food, and by food (the organs of) the vital airs are not closed up. He lays down (the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â) close to the two seasonal ones: he thereby establishes speech in the seasons, and hence speech (the mouth) speaks here, firmly established in the seasons.

<span id="v7_4_2_3838"><sup><small>7:4:2:3838.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say, ‘If the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis (brick) is progeny, and the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â speech, why does he put the two seasonal ones between them?’ Well, the seasonal ones being the year, he thus separates speech from progeny by the year, and hence children utter speech at the time (or age) of a year.

<span id="v7_4_2_3939"><sup><small>7:4:2:3939.</small></sup></span>  \[He lays down the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 26\] ‘Thou art Ashâ<i>dh</i>â, the conquering,’ for the gods thereby conquered the Asuras,—‘conquer the enemies! conquer the hostile!’ as the text, so the meaning;—‘thou hast a thousand energies: do thou speed me!’ a thousand means <span id="p389">[<sup><small>p. 389</small></sup>]</span> all: thus, ‘thou hast all energies, do thou speed me!’ When he has ‘settled’ it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v7_4_2_4040"><sup><small>7:4:2:4040.</small></sup></span>  Here now they say, ‘Why are those other bricks placed in front of the naturally-perforated one?’ Let him say, There are two wombs (birthplaces)—the one being the womb of the gods, the other the womb of men: the gods have their birthplace in the east, and men in the west; and when he lays down those (bricks) in front, he thereby causes the Sacrificer to be born from the womb of the gods.

[^689]: 367:2 Viz. both the gold plate (the sun), which was laid down with the embossed or front side downwards, and the gold man.

[^690]: 368:1 Cf. [VI, 7, 1, 11](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_1_11), where it is said that the immortal part of the vital air of man streams out by upward breathings. Cf. [p. 359](Book_3_7_3#p359), n. [1](Book_3_7_3#fn673).

[^691]: 369:1 That is, he sings the Kitra-sâman, Sâma-v. I, 169 (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXVII, 39), ‘With what favour will the bright one, the ever-growing friend, be with us; with what mightiest host?’

[^692]: 371:1 See p. 53, note 2. In the present instance, the sacrificial formulas themselves constitute these charms. The five verses, only the first pâda of the first of which is given in the text, are as follows:—

1\. Put forth thy power as (if it were) a broad host (or, net); go forth, like a mighty king with his following, following up the swift host! An archer thou art: pierce the Rakshas with thy fieriest (darts).

2\. Swiftly fly thy whirling (darts): fiercely burning attack thou boldly! Unfettered, O Agni, with thy tongue pour forth on all sides winged flames and firebrands.

3\. Thou, the most rapid, send forth thy spies: be thou an undaunted protector to this people (from him) who planneth evil against us from afar or from near by; O Agni, let none dare to attack us without thy cognizance.

4\. Rise, O Agni, spread thyself out, and burn down the foes, O sharp-darted: whosoever hath done us injury, burn him down, O flaming one, like dry brushwood. p. 372

5\. Stand up, O Agni; strike out for our sake, and manifest thy divine powers! unstring the strong (arrows, or bows) of the goblins: crush the enemies, be they kindred or strangers!

[^693]: 373:1 The order in which he offers would thus be,—west, north, east, (then going back along the north and west sides) south, west.

[^694]: 373:2 They are indeed of an arm's length, with bowls of the shape and size of the hand, see part i, p. 67, note 2.

[^695]: 375:1 There seems to be considerable difference of opinion between Kâtyâyana and Sâya<i>n</i>a regarding this point of the ceremonial. The gold man lies stretched out on his back with his head towards the east. According to Kâtyâyana, XVII, 4, 10, he (the Sacrificer) is to lie down so as to cover the gold man, but without actually touching him with his breast, and at the extreme end of where the arms touch (the ground) he is to make two marks, where the spoons are then to be laid down with the bowl towards the east. Sâya<i>n</i>a, p. 376 on the other hand, explains—‘Let the Adhvaryu lay down the two spoons close to the breast of the laid-down gold man. Having beheld (i.e. recognised)—or, whilst beholding (?)—that man, where-ever the laid-down pair of spoons reaches his breast there, having made a mark, let him lay down the two spoons: that part of the breast doubtless is the place of those two (spoons, or gods?) extolled as the arms.’ Perhaps the text of this comment is somewhat corrupt. The ceremony is apparently intended to symbolise the identification of the Sacrificer with the sacrificial man, or the sacrifice itself: The Sacrificer lies down so as to rest on his forearms; the spoons being afterwards laid down on the marks left by the fore-arms (and naturally running in an easterly direction).—For Professor Weber's view, see [p. 367](#p367), note [^686].

[^696]: 376:1 That is to say, Let it be a gold statuette without arms.

[^698]: 377:1 ? Viz. inasmuch as the food is introduced into the body from above. It might also mean, he makes the food superior to the body, inasmuch as the body cannot exist without it. Similarly as regards the breath in the next paragraph.

[^699]: 378:1 The ‘pratish<i>th</i>â’ (basis) of the bird-shaped Agni includes the parts on which the bird stands or sits, viz. the feet, and the hind-part of the body. Sâya<i>n</i>a, on the other hand, takes it to mean the ‘pu<i>m</i>liṅga,’ which seems very improbable.

[^700]: 378:2 See [VI, 2, 3, 1](Book_3_6_2#v6_2_3_1).

[^701]: 379:1 See [p. 155](Book_3_6_1#p155), note [8](Book_3_6_1#fn316).

[^702]: 379:2. That is, by adding the formula, ‘By that deity, Aṅgiras-like, lie thou steady!’

[^703]: 379:3 See [p. 301](Book_3_7_1#p301), note [3](Book_3_7_1#fn563).

[^704]: 379:4 That is to say, How will he (the Sacrificer) be able to rise upwards to heaven, when that brick is lying on him?

[^705]: 379:5 See [p. 187](Book_3_6_2#p187), note [3](Book_3_6_2#fn384).

[^706]: 380:1 See [VI, 2, 3, 2](Book_3_6_2#v6_2_3_2).

[^707]: 381:1 The root is to lie on the brick from which (as representing the earth) it is supposed to have sprung; the tops then spreading along the ground.

[^708]: 381:2 This brick is placed close beside the svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â (naturally-perforated one) in front (east) of it, on the ‘anûka’ or spine.

[^709]: 382:1 The verb ‘apa-<i>s</i>ish’ is taken similarly by Sâya<i>n</i>a (ava<i>s</i>eshayet); whilst the St. Petersburg dictionary assigns to it the meaning ‘to omit, leave out’ (weglassen), which can hardly be correct (? misprint for übriglassen). It might, however, possibly be taken in the sense of ‘vi-<i>s</i>ish,’ to specify, to single out.

[^710]: 382:2 That is to say, he would not, after quitting his mortal body, know or find out that divine body with which he wishes to invest himself.

[^711]: 384:1 Or, the wide-shining . . . the self-shining one.

[^712]: 384:2 The two Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> bricks are laid down immediately in front (east) of the Dviya<i>g</i>us one, one on each side of the ‘spine,’ which thus coincides with their line of separation.

[^713]: 384:3 See [VI, 5, 3, 3](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_3_3).

[^714]: 384:4 As in the case of the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>âs (naturally-perforated bricks, see pp. [155](Book_3_6_1#p155), note [8](Book_3_6_1#fn316); [187](Book_3_6_2#p187), note [2](Book_3_6_2#fn383)), so there are three Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis or ‘all-light’ bricks, placed in the first, third, and fifth layers p. 385 of the altar, and representing the light (or ruling deity) of the respective world represented by the svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â of the same layer.

[^715]: 385:1 In reality the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis brick is not placed between the two Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i>, but in front of the line separating them from each other.

[^716]: 385:2 He ‘saw’ the first naturally-perforated brick, which, as the central brick of the first layer, represents the latter, as well as the lowest of the three worlds, the earth. See [VI, 2, 3, 1](Book_3_6_2#v6_2_3_1).

[^717]: 385:3 Viz. by adding, ‘by that deity, Aṅgiras-like, lie thou steady!’

[^718]: 386:1 That is, he pronounces the sâdana-formula once only.

[^719]: 386:2 Viz. its foundation.

[^720]: 387:1 See [VI, 5, 3, 1](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_3_1)\-[2](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_3_2).

[^721]: 387:2 Viz. by threats, vituperation, &c., Sây.
