<span id="v3_7_1"><sup><small>3:7:1</small></sup></span>

## SEVENTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_7_1_11"><sup><small>3:7:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He takes the spade, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 1), ‘I take thee, at the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, with the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, with the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman.’ The significance of that formula is the same (as before); and that spade (abhri, fem.) is indeed female: therefore he says ‘thou art a woman.’

<span id="v3_7_1_22"><sup><small>3:7:1:22.</small></sup></span>  He thus draws the outline of the hole (for the stake [^437]), with, ‘Herewith I cut off the necks of <span id="p168"><sup><small>[ p. 168 ]</small></sup></span> the Rakshas!’ The spade is the thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he thus cuts off the necks of the Rakshas.

<span id="v3_7_1_33"><sup><small>3:7:1:33.</small></sup></span>  He then digs, and throws up a heap of earth towards the east. He digs the hole, making it equal (in depth) with the (unhewn) bottom part (of the stake). In front of it he lays down the stake with the top towards the east. Thereon he puts sacrificial grass of the same size, and thereupon he puts the chip of the stake. In front on the (north) side (of the stake) he puts down the head-piece [^438]. The sprinkling-water has barley-corns mixed with it: the significance of this is the same (as before [^439]).

<span id="v3_7_1_44"><sup><small>3:7:1:44.</small></sup></span>  He throws the barley-corns in with, ‘Thou art barley (yava), keep thou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!’ There is nothing obscure in this. He then sprinkles: the significance of the sprinkling is one and the same: he thereby renders it sacrificially pure.

<span id="v3_7_1_55"><sup><small>3:7:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He sprinkles (the top, middle, and bottom parts) with, ‘For the sky—thee! for the air—thee! for the earth—thee!’ the stake being a thunderbolt (he does so) for the protection of these worlds [^440]: ‘I sprinkle thee for the protection of these worlds,’ is what he thereby means to say.

<span id="v3_7_1_66"><sup><small>3:7:1:66.</small></sup></span>  The sprinkling-water that remains he then pours into the hole with, ‘Be the worlds pure <span id="p169"><sup><small>[ p. 169 ]</small></sup></span> wherein the Fathers reside!’ for a pit that is dug is sacred to the Fathers: this he thereby renders sacrificially pure.

<span id="v3_7_1_77"><sup><small>3:7:1:77.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he strews barhis-grass therein, both eastward-pointed and northward-pointed, with, ‘Thou art the seat of the Fathers!’ for that part of it (the stake) which is dug into the ground is sacred to the Fathers: as though it were (naturally) established among plants, and not dug in, so does it become established among those plants.

<span id="v3_7_1_88"><sup><small>3:7:1:88.</small></sup></span>  He then throws in the (first) chip [^441] of the stake. Now that chip of the outer (bark) doubtless is the vigour of trees; hence, when a chip of their outer (bark) is cut off they dry up, for it is their vigour. Hence, when he throws in the chip of the stake, he does so thinking, ‘I will plant it (the stake) full of vigour.’ The reason why it is this (chip) and no other, is that this one has been produced with a formula, is sacrificially pure: therefore he throws in the chip of the stake.

<span id="v3_7_1_99"><sup><small>3:7:1:99.</small></sup></span>  He throws it in with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 2), ‘Thou art a leader, easy of access to the Unnet<i>ri</i>s [^442];’ for that (chip) is cut from it in front, wherefore he says, ‘Thou art a leader, easy of access to the Unnet<i>ri</i>s.’ ‘Be thou mindful of this: it will stand upon thee!’ for it (the stake) will indeed stand on it, wherefore he says, ‘Be thou mindful of this: it will stand upon thee.’

<span id="v3_7_1_1010"><sup><small>3:7:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  Having then taken out ghee with the dipping-spoon, he offers it into the hole, ‘lest the evil spirits should rise from below:’ ghee is a thunderbolt, he <span id="p170"><sup><small>[ p. 170 ]</small></sup></span> thus repels the evil spirits by means of the thunderbolt, and thus the evil spirits do not rise from below. Having then gone round to the front, he sits down facing the north and anoints the stake. He says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite to the stake as it is anointed [^443]!’

<span id="v3_7_1_1111"><sup><small>3:7:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  He anoints it with, ‘The divine Savit<i>ri</i> anoint thee with sweet drink (milk)!’ for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) of the gods, and that stake is in reality the sacrificer himself; and sweet drink is everything here; he thus puts it in connection with all that, and Savit<i>ri</i>, the impeller, impels it for him: therefore he says, ‘The divine Savit<i>ri</i> anoint thee with sweet drink!’

<span id="v3_7_1_1212"><sup><small>3:7:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  Having then anointed the top-ring on both sides, he puts it on (the stake) with, ‘To the full-berried plants—thee!’ for that (top-ring) is as its berry. And as to its being, as it were, contracted in the middle, the berry [^444] here on trees is fastened (to the stalk) sideways; what connecting part there is between (the fruit and stalk) pressed in, as it were, that he thereby makes it. This is why it is, as it were, contracted in the middle.

<span id="v3_7_1_1313"><sup><small>3:7:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  He anoints from top to bottom the (corner) facing the fire; for the (corner) facing the fire is the sacrificer, and the ghee is sap: with sap he thus anoints the sacrificer; therefore he anoints from top to bottom the (corner) facing the fire. He then <span id="p171"><sup><small>[ p. 171 ]</small></sup></span> grasps the girding-part all round, and says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite to the (stake) being set up!’

<span id="v3_7_1_1414"><sup><small>3:7:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  He raises it with, ‘With thy crest thou hast touched the sky; with thy middle thou hast filled the air; with thy foot thou hast steadied the earth;’—the sacrificial stake being a thunderbolt, (he raises it) for the conquering of these worlds; with that thunderbolt he gains these worlds, and deprives his enemies of their share in these worlds.

<span id="v3_7_1_1515"><sup><small>3:7:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  He then plants it (in the hole) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 3), 'To what resorts of thine we long to go where are the swift-footed, many-horned kine; there, forsooth, was imprinted wide-striding Vish<i>n</i>u's highest mighty foot-step.' With this trish<i>t</i>ubh verse he plants it; the trish<i>t</i>ubh is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt; therefore he plants it with a trish<i>t</i>ubh verse.

<span id="v3_7_1_1616"><sup><small>3:7:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  That (corner which was) facing the fire he places opposite the fire; for the (corner) facing the fire is the sacrificer, and the sacrifice is fire. Hence were he to turn the fire-corner aside from the fire, the sacrificer would assuredly turn aside from the sacrifice; therefore he places the (corner which was) facing the fire opposite the fire. He then heaps up (earth) round it and presses it firmly all round, and pours water thereon [^445].

<span id="v3_7_1_1717"><sup><small>3:7:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he makes (the sacrificer) say while touching it (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 4; Rig-veda I, 22, 19), 'See ye the deeds of Vish<i>n</i>u, whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances, Indra's allied <span id="p172"><sup><small>[ p. 172 ]</small></sup></span> friend!' For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled the thunderbolt: 'See ye Vish<i>n</i>u's conquest!' he means to say when he says, 'See ye the deeds of Vish<i>n</i>u, whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances, Indra's allied friend.' Indra, forsooth, is the deity of the sacrifice, and the sacrificial stake belongs to Vish<i>n</i>u; he thereby connects it with Indra; therefore he says, 'Indra's allied friend.’

<span id="v3_7_1_1818"><sup><small>3:7:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  He then looks up at the top-ring with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 5; Rig-veda I, 22, 20), ‘The wise ever behold that highest step of Vish<i>n</i>u, fixed like an eye in the heaven.’ For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled the thunderbolt: ‘See ye that conquest of Vish<i>n</i>u!’ he means to say when he says, ‘The wise ever behold that highest step of Vish<i>n</i>u, fixed like an eye in the heaven.’

<span id="v3_7_1_1919"><sup><small>3:7:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  He then girds (the stake with a rope of ku<i>s</i>a-grass). Now it is to cover its nakedness that he girds it; wherefore he girds it in this place (viz. on a level with the sacrificer's navel), for it is thus that this (nether) garment is (slung round) [^446]. He thereby puts food into him, for it is there that the food settles; therefore he girds it at that place.

<span id="v3_7_1_2020"><sup><small>3:7:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  He girds it with a triple (rope), for threefold is food, and food means cattle; and (there is) the father and the mother, and what is born is the third; therefore he girds it with a triple (rope).

<span id="v3_7_1_2121"><sup><small>3:7:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  He girds it with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 6), ‘Thou art enfolded; may the heavenly hosts enfold <span id="p173"><sup><small>[ p. 173 ]</small></sup></span> thee! may riches enfold this sacrificer among men!’ He invokes a blessing on the sacrificer, when he says, ‘May riches enfold this sacrificer among men.’

<span id="v3_7_1_2222"><sup><small>3:7:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he inserts a chip of the stake (under the rope) with, ‘Thou art the son of the sky.’ For it is doubtless the offspring of that (sacrificial stake); hence if there be the full number of eleven stakes [^447], let him insert in each its own (chip) without confounding them; and his offspring is born orderly and not foolish. But whosoever inserts them in confusion, not its own in each, verily his offspring is born disorderly and foolish; therefore let him insert its own in each without confounding them.

<span id="v3_7_1_2323"><sup><small>3:7:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  Moreover, that chip of the stake is made an ascent to the heavenly world; there is this girdle-rope; after the rope the chip of the stake; after the chip of the stake the top-ring; and from the top-ring one reaches the heavenly world.

<span id="v3_7_1_2424"><sup><small>3:7:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it is called svaru (‘very sore’),—that (chip) is cut off from that (stake), and thus is its own (sva) sore (arus); therefore it is called ‘svaru.’

<span id="v3_7_1_2525"><sup><small>3:7:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  With that part of it which is dug in, he gains the world of the Fathers; and with what is above the dug-in part, up to the girdle-rope, he gains the world of men; and with what is above the rope, up to the top-ring, he gains the world of the gods; and what (space of) two or three fingers’ breadths <span id="p174"><sup><small>[ p. 174 ]</small></sup></span> there is above the top-ring,—the gods called the ‘Blessed [^448],’—their world he therewith gains; verily, whosoever thus knows this, he becomes one of the same world with the blessed gods.

<span id="v3_7_1_2626"><sup><small>3:7:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  That (sacrificial stake) he sets up on the fore-part (of the altar); for the stake is a thunderbolt, as the club is a thunderbolt. But in hurling the club one takes hold of its fore-part; and that (stake) is the fore-part of the sacrifice; therefore he sets it up on the fore-part (of the altar).

<span id="v3_7_1_2727"><sup><small>3:7:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield. They spake, ‘How may this (world) of ours be made unattainable to men?’ They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey, and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial stake, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (sacrificial stake). At the head stands intelligence, at the head swiftness of thought; therefore he sets it up on the fore-part (of the altar).

<span id="v3_7_1_2828"><sup><small>3:7:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  It is eight-cornered; for the gâyatrî  metre consists of eight syllables, and the gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as this (stake) is the forepart of the sacrifice; therefore it is eight-cornered.

<span id="v3_7_1_2929"><sup><small>3:7:1:2929.</small></sup></span>  Now the gods once threw it after (the prastara into the fire) even as now some throw it after, thinking, ‘So the gods did it.’ Thereupon the Rakshas sipped the sacrifice (Soma) after (the gods).

<span id="v3_7_1_3030"><sup><small>3:7:1:3030.</small></sup></span>  The gods said unto the Adhvaryu, ‘Offer thou only a chip of the stake; thereby this (sacrificer) <span id="p175"><sup><small>[ p. 175 ]</small></sup></span> will be bid good-speed [^449]; and thus the Rakshas will not hereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, “that (stake) surely is a raised thunderbolt.”’

<span id="v3_7_1_3131"><sup><small>3:7:1:3131.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu, then, offered up only a chip of the stake, and thereby that (sacrificer) was bid good-speed; and thus the Rakshas did not thereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, ‘that surely is a raised thunderbolt.’

<span id="v3_7_1_3232"><sup><small>3:7:1:3232.</small></sup></span>  And in like manner does he now only offer up that chip of the sacrificial stake [^450]; thereby this (sacrificer) is bid good-speed; and thus the Rakshas do not thereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, ‘that surely is a raised thunderbolt!’ He offers it [^451] with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 21), ‘May thy smoke rise up to the sky, thy light to the heavens! fill the earth with ashes, Hail!’


<span id="v3_7_2"><sup><small>3:7:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_7_2_11"><sup><small>3:7:2:11.</small></sup></span>  Verily, as large as the altar is, so large is the earth. The sacrificial stakes are thunderbolts; and by means of these thunderbolts he obtains possession of this earth, and excludes his enemies from sharing therein. Hence there are eleven stakes, and the twelfth lies aside rough-hewn; he puts it down south (of the altar). The reason why the twelfth lies aside is this.

<span id="v3_7_2_22"><sup><small>3:7:2:22.</small></sup></span>  Now the gods, while performing this sacrifice, <span id="p176"><sup><small>[ p. 176 ]</small></sup></span> were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. Those raised (sacrificial stakes), then, were as a discharged arrow,—therewith one either smites or smites not; as a hurled club,—therewith one either smites or smites not. But that twelfth (stake) lying aside,—even as an arrow drawn but not discharged, as (a weapon) raised but not hurled, so was that a thunderbolt raised for repelling the evil spirits on the south; therefore the twelfth (stake) lies aside.

<span id="v3_7_2_33"><sup><small>3:7:2:33.</small></sup></span>  He lays it down with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 6), ‘This is thy place on earth; thine is the beast of the forest.’ There are the animal (victim) and the sacrificial stake; to this one he thereby assigns of animals that of the forest, and thus it, too, is possessed of an animal (victim). That setting up of the eleven sacrificial stakes is said to be of two kinds,—some, namely, set (them all) up (on the previous day) for the morrow's Soma feast, and others set up (one) stake for the preparation [^452] of the morrow's Soma feast.

<span id="v3_7_2_44"><sup><small>3:7:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Let him, however, not do this; but let him only set up the one opposite the fire. For after setting it up the Adhvaryu does not quit his hold of it till the girding; but those (others) remain <span id="p177"><sup><small>[ p. 177 ]</small></sup></span> ungirt during that night. Thus there would be an offence, since it is for the victim that the stake is set up, and the victim is (only) slaughtered on the next morning: let him therefore set up (the others) on the next morning.

<span id="v3_7_2_55"><sup><small>3:7:2:55.</small></sup></span>  Let him first set up that (stake) which stands (immediately) north of the one opposite the fire, then the one on the south, then a northern one,—last of all the one on the southern flank: thus it (the row of stakes) inclines to the north.

<span id="v3_7_2_66"><sup><small>3:7:2:66.</small></sup></span>  But they also say conversely [^453], ‘Let him first set up that which is south of the one opposite the fire, then the northern one, then a southern one,—last of all the one on the northern flank: and thus indeed his work attains completion towards the north.’

<span id="v3_7_2_77"><sup><small>3:7:2:77.</small></sup></span>  Let the largest be the one forming the southern flank; then shorter and shorter; and the one forming the northern flank the shortest: thus (the row of stakes) inclines to the north.

<span id="v3_7_2_88"><sup><small>3:7:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon they set up the wife-stake for the wives. It is for the sake of completeness, forsooth, that the wife-stake is set up: there they seize (and bind) the victim for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> fashions the cast seed, and hence he fashions the seed now cast. It (the victim to Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>) is an animal with testicles, for such a one is a begetter. Let him not slay that one, but let him set it free after fire has been carried round it. Were he to slay it, there would assuredly be an end to offspring, but in this way he sets free the offspring. Therefore let him not <span id="p178"><sup><small>[ p. 178 ]</small></sup></span> slay it, but let him set it free after fire has been carried round it.


<span id="v3_7_3"><sup><small>3:7:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

#### B. THE KILLING OF THE VICTIM.

<span id="v3_7_3_11"><sup><small>3:7:3:11.</small></sup></span>  There are both an animal and a sacrificial stake, for never do they immolate an animal without a stake. And as to why this is so:—well, animals did not at first submit thereto that they should become food, as they are now become food; for just as man here walks two-footed and erect, so did they walk two-footed and erect.

<span id="v3_7_3_22"><sup><small>3:7:3:22.</small></sup></span>  Then the gods perceived that thunderbolt, to wit, the sacrificial stake; they raised it, and from fear thereof they (the animals) shrunk together and thus became four-footed, and thus became food, as they are now become food, for they submitted thereto: wherefore they immolate the animal only at a stake and never without a stake.

<span id="v3_7_3_33"><sup><small>3:7:3:33.</small></sup></span>  Having driven up the victim, and churned the fire, he binds it (to the stake). And as to why this is so:—well, animals did not at first submit thereto that they should become sacrificial food, as they are now become sacrificial food and are offered up in the fire. The gods secured them: even thus secured they did not resign themselves.

<span id="v3_7_3_44"><sup><small>3:7:3:44.</small></sup></span>  They spake, ‘Verily, these (animals) know not the manner of this, that it is in fire that sacrificial food is offered, nor (do they know) that secure resort (the fire): let us offer fire into the fire after securing the animals and churning the fire, and they will know that this truly is the manner of sacrificial food, <span id="p179"><sup><small>[ p. 179 ]</small></sup></span> this its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered: and accordingly they will resign themselves, and will be favourably disposed to the slaughtering.’

<span id="v3_7_3_55"><sup><small>3:7:3:55.</small></sup></span>  Having, then, first secured the animals, and churned the fire, they offered fire into the fire; and then they (the animals) knew that this truly is the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered. And accordingly they resigned themselves, and became favourably disposed to the slaughtering.

<span id="v3_7_3_66"><sup><small>3:7:3:66.</small></sup></span>  And in like manner does he now offer fire into the fire, after securing the animal and churning the fire. It (the animal) knows that this truly is the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered; and accordingly it resigns itself and becomes favourably disposed to the slaughtering. Therefore having driven up the victim and churned the fire, he binds it (to the stake).

<span id="v3_7_3_77"><sup><small>3:7:3:77.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘Let him not drive up (the victim), nor churn the fire; but having taken the rope and straightway gone thither and put (the rope) round it, let him bind it.’ Let him, however, not do this; for it would be as if he intended to commit secretly some lawless action. Let him therefore go round there.

<span id="v3_7_3_88"><sup><small>3:7:3:88.</small></sup></span>  Then, taking a straw, he drives it up, thinking, ‘having a companion, I will secure it;’ for he who has a companion is strong.

<span id="v3_7_3_99"><sup><small>3:7:3:99.</small></sup></span>  He takes the straw with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 7), ‘Thou art a cheerer!’ for a companion does cheer one: therefore he says, ‘Thou art a cheerer.’ ‘The celestial hosts have approached the gods;’ <span id="p180"><sup><small>[ p. 180 ]</small></sup></span> the celestial hosts, forsooth, are those beasts: ‘they have submitted to the gods’ he means to say, when he says, ‘The celestial hosts have approached the gods.’

<span id="v3_7_3_1010"><sup><small>3:7:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  ‘The considerate [^454], best of leaders;’ for the gods are wise: therefore he says, ‘The considerate, best of leaders.’

<span id="v3_7_3_1111"><sup><small>3:7:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  ‘O divine Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, settle the wealth!’ for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> is lord of beasts (cattle), and wealth means cattle, it is with regard to those which did not submit that the gods then said to Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, ‘Quiet them,’ when he says, ‘O divine Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, settle the wealth!’

<span id="v3_7_3_1212"><sup><small>3:7:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘May the offerings be relished by thee!’ Since they themselves submitted thereto that they should become sacrificial food, therefore he says, ‘May the offerings be relished by thee!’

<span id="v3_7_3_1313"><sup><small>3:7:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  ‘Rejoice, ye prosperous!’ for cattle are prosperous: therefore he says, ‘Rejoice ye prosperous.’ ‘O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!’ The Lord of prayer, forsooth, is the Brahman; and goods mean cattle: those, which did not submit, the gods on that occasion enclosed with the Brahman on the farther side, and they did not pass over it. And in like manner does he now enclose them with the Brahman on the farther side, and they do not pass over it: therefore he says, ‘O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!’ Having made a noose he throws it over (the victim) [^455]. Now then as to the binding itself.


<span id="p181"><sup><small>[ p. 181 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="v3_7_4"><sup><small>3:7:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v3_7_4_11"><sup><small>3:7:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Having made a noose, he throws it over (the victim) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 8), ‘With the noose of sacred order I bind thee, O oblation to the gods!’ for that rope, forsooth, is Varu<i>n</i>a's: therefore he thus binds it with the noose of sacred order, and thus that rope of Varu<i>n</i>a does not injure it.

<span id="v3_7_4_22"><sup><small>3:7:4:22.</small></sup></span>  ‘Be bold, O man [^456]!’ for at first man dared not [^457] to approach it (the victim); but now that he thus binds it with the noose of sacred order, as an oblation to the gods, man dares to approach it: therefore he says, ‘Be bold, O man!’

<span id="v3_7_4_33"><sup><small>3:7:4:33.</small></sup></span>  He then binds it (to the stake) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 9), ‘At the impulse of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, I bind thee with the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, with the hands of Pûshan, thee agreeable to Agni and Soma!’ Even as on that occasion [^458], when taking out an oblation for a deity, he assigns it, so does he now assign it to the two deities. He then sprinkles it,—one and the same, forsooth, is the <span id="p182"><sup><small>[ p. 182 ]</small></sup></span> significance of sprinkling: he thereby makes it sacrificially pure.

<span id="v3_7_4_44"><sup><small>3:7:4:44.</small></sup></span>  He sprinkles with, ‘For the waters—thee, for the plants!’ whereby it (the victim) exists, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure. For when it rains, then plants are produced here on earth; and by eating plants and drinking water that sap originates, and from sap seed, and from seed beasts: hence whereby it exists, wherefrom it springs, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure.

<span id="v3_7_4_55"><sup><small>3:7:4:55.</small></sup></span>  ‘May thy mother grant thee permission, and thy father—;’ for it is from its mother and father that it is born: hence wherefrom it is born, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure; ‘—thine own brother, thy fellow in the herd;’ whereby he means to say, ‘whatever kin there is of thine, with their approval I slay thee.’ ‘I sprinkle thee, agreeable to Agni and Soma;’ he thus makes it pure for those two deities for whom he slays it.

<span id="v3_7_4_66"><sup><small>3:7:4:66.</small></sup></span>  With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 10), ‘Thou art a drinker of water,’ he then holds (the lustral water) under (its mouth), whereby he renders it internally pure. He then sprinkles it underneath (the body), with, ‘May the divine waters make it palatable, a true palatable offering to the gods!’ he thus makes it sacrificially pure all over.

<span id="v3_7_4_77"><sup><small>3:7:4:77.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite to the fire being kindled!’ when he has made the second libation of ghee [^459], and returned (to his former place) without letting the two spoons touch one another [^460], he anoints the victim with the (ghee in the)

<span id="p183"><sup><small>[ p. 183 ]</small></sup></span>

<i>g</i>uhû, For the second libation is the head of the sacrifice, and the sacrifice here indeed is that victim: hence he thereby puts the head on the sacrifice and therefore anoints the victim with the <i>g</i>uhû.

<span id="v3_7_4_88"><sup><small>3:7:4:88.</small></sup></span>  With ‘May thy breath unite with the wind!’ he anoints it on the forehead; with ‘Thy limbs with those worthy of sacrifice’ on the shoulders; with ‘The lord of sacrifice with (the object of) his prayer!’ the loins; whereby he means to say, ‘For whatsoever object the animal is slain, do thou obtain that!’

<span id="v3_7_4_99"><sup><small>3:7:4:99.</small></sup></span>  For, indeed, the breath of the victim when slain here passes into the wind: ‘Obtain thou that thy breath may pass into the wind!’ is what he thereby means to say. ‘Thy limbs with those worthy of offering’ he says, because it is with its limbs that they sacrifice: ‘Obtain thou that they may sacrifice with thy limbs’ is what he thereby means to say. ‘The lord of sacrifice with his prayer,’ hereby they invoke a blessing on the sacrificer: ‘Obtain thou that through thee they may invoke a blessing on the sacrificer’ is what he thereby means to say. He then deposits the two spoons and calls for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i> with a view to the Pravara (election of the Hot<i>ri</i>) [^461]. The significance of this is the same (as before).

<span id="v3_7_4_1010"><sup><small>3:7:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon he calls a second time for the Srausha<i>t</i>, for on this occasion there are two Hot<i>ri</i>s it is with regard to the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a [^462] that he now calls for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>. But it is the sacrificer whom <span id="p184"><sup><small>[ p. 184 ]</small></sup></span> he chooses, saying, ‘Verily, Agni is the leader of the divine hosts,’ for Agni is the head of the deities; wherefore he says, ‘Verily, Agni is the leader of the divine hosts;’—‘this sacrificer of the human;’ for that community wherein he sacrifices is behind (inferior to) him; wherefore he says, ‘This sacrificer (is the head) of the human.’ ‘May the household of these two shine brightly, not (like a cart yoked) with one bullock, for a hundred winters,—two yoke-fellows!’ whereby he means to say, ‘May their household matters be free from calamities for a hundred years [^463].’

<span id="v3_7_4_1111"><sup><small>3:7:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  ‘Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies;’ whereby he means to say, ‘Unite ye your blessings only, but not also your bodies;’ for were they also to unite their bodies, Agni (the fire) would burn the sacrificer. Now when this one sacrifices in the fire, he gives gifts to Agni; and whatever blessing the priests here invoke upon the sacrificer, all that Agni accomplishes. Thus they unite only their blessings, but not also their bodies: wherefore he says, ‘Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies.’

## Footnotes

[^439]: 167:3 According to the Kâ<i>n</i>va text, one half of it is to be within, and one half outside of the altar. See Kâty. VI, 2, 8.

[^440]: 168:1 Of the part of the tree cut off from the sacrificial stake, a top-piece or head-ring (<i>k</i>ashâla) is made some eight or nine inches high, eight-cornered (like the sacrificial stake); narrower in the middle like a mortar, and hollowed out so as to allow its being fixed on the stake.

[^441]: 168:2 See [III, 6, 1, 7](Book_2_3_6#v3_6_1_7) seq.

[^442]: 168:3 For the construction, see [p. 15](Book_2_3_1#p15), note [3](Book_2_3_1#fn55).

[^443]: 169:1 See [III, 6, 4, 11](Book_2_3_6#v3_6_4_11).

[^444]: 169:2 The Unnet<i>ri</i>s are the priests that have to draw the Soma.

[^445]: 170:1 ‘Recite to the stake being anointed!’ or, ‘we anoint the stake: Recite!’ Kâ<i>n</i>va rec. The latter is the formula mentioned Ait. Br. II, 2 (but ‘a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>mo yûpam,’ for Kâ<i>n</i>va ‘yûpam a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>mo’); where the seven verses recited by the Hot<i>ri</i> (brought up to eleven as usual) are given. See also Â<i>s</i>v. III, 1, 8.

[^446]: 170:2 Pippala refers especially to the berry or fruit of the Ficus Religiosa.

[^447]: 171:1 The same formulas are used on this occasion as at [III, 6, 1, 17](Book_2_3_6#v3_6_1_17)\-[18](Book_2_3_6#v3_6_1_18).

[^448]: 172:1 According to the Kâ<i>n</i>va text it is to be slung round nîvídaghne, ‘on a level with the nether garment’ (nâbhidaghne, Taitt. S. VI, 3, 4, 5). According to Kâty. VI, 3, 1, the girding is preceded by a call on the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite to the post being anointed; but neither recension mentions this.

[^449]: 173:1 When, instead of a single he-goat to Agni, eleven victims are slaughtered, they are either bound to one stake each, or all to one and the same. See [III, 9, 1, 4](Book_2_3_9#v3_9_1_4) seq. The chip alluded to is one of those obtained in rough-hewing the stake and making it eight-cornered.

[^450]: 174:1 On the ‘sâdhyas’ see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 6, note 2.

[^451]: 175:1 See I, 8, 3, 11 seq.

[^452]: 175:2 See Ait. Br. II, 3.

[^453]: 175:3 The offering of the chips does not take place till the end of the after-offerings (see note to [III, 8, 5, 6](Book_2_3_8#v3_8_5_6)). It is somewhat strange that it should be anticipated in this place, both in this and the Kâ<i>n</i>va recensions.

[^454]: 176:1 No satisfactory explanation of ‘prakubratâ’ occurs to me. It seems to he derived from ‘kubra,’ to which the dictionaries assign the meanings ‘hole for sacrificial fire’ and ‘thread’ (besides those of ‘forest,’ ‘earring,’ and ‘cart’). U<i>n</i>âd. II, 28, derives this from a root ‘kub,’ to cover, shelter. ? For the safe foundation (or the protraction) of to-morrow's Soma feast. The Kâ<i>n</i>va text, on the other hand, reads: 'Some, now, raise all (the stakes) on the upavasatha (day before the Soma feast) for the sake of quickening (?prakudratâyai) the work, thinking, ‘we will quickly bring the sacrifice to a close.’

[^455]: 177:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text first mentions the practice set forth in the preceding paragraph, as the teaching of ‘some,’ but then rejects it in favour of the second alternative.

[^456]: 180:1 U<i>s</i>i<i>g</i> rather means ‘willing, loving, devoted.’

[^457]: 180:2 According to the Taitt. authorities (Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. I, 3, 8), the rope is wound round the right fore-leg and then passed upwards p. 181 to the head. From Kâty. VI, 3, 27, on the other hand, it would seem that the rope is passed either between the horns (and under the neck?), or round the horns.

[^458]: 181:1 Thus the author appears to take the formula ‘dharshâ mấnusha<i>h</i>.’ It would rather seem to mean, ‘Be bold: \[I am (or he, the slaughterer, is)\] a man.’ Mahîdhara interprets, ‘May he (the <i>S</i>amit<i>ri</i>) be bold enough!’ Either the Kâ<i>n</i>va reading ‘dharshân mânusha<i>h</i>’ or that of the Taittirîyas ‘dharshâ mânushân’ would seem preferable.

[^459]: 181:2 The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has ‘dh<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>oti’ for ‘adh<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>ot,’ which renders it more simple: ‘At first the man (the slaughterer) dares not approach it, but when he thus binds it, &c.’

[^460]: 181:3 Viz. at the Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a; see I, 1, 2, 17.

[^461]: 182:1 For the course of performance, see I, 3, 5, 1 seq.; I, 4, 4, 1 seq.

[^462]: 182:2 See I, 4, 5, 5.

[^463]: 183:1 See I, 5, 1, 1 seq. (also note to part i, p. 115).

[^464]: 183:2 The Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a or Pra<i>s</i>âst<i>ri</i> is the Hot<i>ri</i>'s chief assistant. He receives, as the badge of his office, the stall which the sacrificer p. 184 held while he was consecrated, and has, at the instance of the Adhvaryu, to call on the Hot<i>ri</i> for the offering-prayers,—his summons (praisha) beginning with Hotâ yakshat, ‘let the Hot<i>ri</i> worship or, pronounce the offering-prayer) . . .,’—and occasionally himself to pronounce the invitatory prayer.

[^465]: 184:1 See I, 9, 3, 79.
