## FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v9_4_1_11"><sup><small>9:4:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the Râsh<i>t</i>rabh<i>ri</i>t (realm-sustaining) oblations;—the realm-sustainers, doubtless, are the kings, for it is they that sustain realms. These deities, indeed, have been consecrated by this same consecration ceremony by which he (the Sacrificer) is now to be consecrated: it is them he thereby gratifies, and thus gratified by offering, they grant him permission (to perform) this consecration ceremony, and, permitted by them, he is consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume it). And inasmuch as the kings sustain realms, and these gods are kings, therefore Realm-sustaining (oblations are performed).

<span id="v9_4_1_22"><sup><small>9:4:1:22.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he offers the Realm-sustaining (oblations). From Pra<i>g</i>âpati, when dismembered, couples went forth, in the form of Gandharvas and Apsaras; and he, having turned into a chariot, enclosed them, and having enclosed them, he took them to himself and made them his own; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), thereby enclosing them, take them to himself and make them his own.

<span id="v9_4_1_33"><sup><small>9:4:1:33.</small></sup></span>  Now that Pra<i>g</i>âpati who was dismembered, is this very Agni who is here being built up; and <span id="p230"><sup><small>[ p. 230 ]</small></sup></span> those couples which went forth from him, are these same deities to whom he now makes offering.

<span id="v9_4_1_44"><sup><small>9:4:1:44.</small></sup></span>  He makes offering to the Gandharvas and Apsaras, for in the form of Gandharvas and Apsaras they went forth (from Pra<i>g</i>âpati). But the Gandharvas and Apsaras also busy themselves with sweet scent (gandha) and beauteous form (rûpa [^389]), whence if any one goes to his mate he cultivates sweet scent and a beautiful appearance.

<span id="v9_4_1_55"><sup><small>9:4:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He offers pairs (of oblations), for birth originates from a pair; and he alone is (ruler of) a kingdom who propagates offspring, but not he who does not propagate offspring. And inasmuch as couples sustain the realm, and these deities consist of couples, these (oblations are called) Realm-sustainers. With ghee taken in twelve ladlings (he offers), and there are twelve of these oblations: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_4_1_66"><sup><small>9:4:1:66.</small></sup></span>  To the male (deity) he makes offering first, then to the females: he thereby endows the male pre-eminently with power [^390]. To a single male he makes offering, and to many females, whence even a single man has many wives. To the male (deity) he makes offering both with the Vasha<i>t</i>\-call and the Svâhâ-call, to the female (deities) only with the Svâhâ: he thereby endows the male pre-eminently with power.

<span id="v9_4_1_77"><sup><small>9:4:1:77.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 38-43\], ‘The <span id="p231"><sup><small>[ p. 231 ]</small></sup></span> law-upholding, law-abiding,’—that is, the truth-upholding, truth-abiding,—‘Agni is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the plants,’—for as a Gandharva, Agni, indeed, went forth with the plants as the Asparas, his mates,—‘Delights (mud) by name,’—the plants are indeed delights, for everything here delights in plants—‘may he protect this our priesthood and nobility: to him Hail! Vâ<i>t</i>! To them (fem.) Hail!’ The meaning of this has been explained [^391]

<span id="v9_4_1_88"><sup><small>9:4:1:88.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Close-knit,’—yonder sun is indeed close-knit, for he knits together the days and nights;—‘all-wealthy,’—for that (sun) indeed is every kind of wealth;—‘Sûrya is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the sun-motes;’—for as a Gandharva, the sun, indeed, went forth with the sun-motes as the Apsaras, his mates,—‘Mobile (âyu) by name,’—for moving together [^392], as it were, the sun-motes float;—‘may he protect this our priesthood and nobility,’—the meaning of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_4_1_99"><sup><small>9:4:1:99.</small></sup></span>  ‘The most blessed,’—that is, the most worthy of worship,—‘sun-rayed,’—for like the sun's are the moon's rays;—‘<i>K</i>andramas (the <span id="p232"><sup><small>[ p. 232 ]</small></sup></span> moon) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the stars;’—for as a Gandharva the moon, indeed, went forth with the stars as the Apsaras, his mates;—‘Luminous (bhekuri) by name;’—light-giving (bhâku<i>ri</i> [^393]) these, indeed, are called, for the stars give light;—‘may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!’ the meaning of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_4_1_1010"><sup><small>9:4:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Agile,’—that is, the swift,—‘all-expansive,’—for the wind (air), indeed, makes up all this expanse;—‘Vâta (the wind) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the waters,’—for as a Gandharva the wind, indeed, went forth with the waters as the Apsaras, his mates;—‘Viands (ûr<i>g</i>) by name,’—the waters, indeed, are called ‘ûr<i>g</i>a<i>h</i>,’ for food is produced from the waters;—‘may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!’ the meaning of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_4_1_1111"><sup><small>9:4:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  ‘The beneficent, well-winged,’—beneficent (bhu<i>g</i>yu [^394]) indeed is the sacrifice, for the sacrifice benefits all beings,—‘Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a (the sacrifice) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the offering-gifts,’—for as a Gandharva the sacrifice, indeed, went forth, with the offering-gifts as the Apsaras, <span id="p233"><sup><small>[ p. 233 ]</small></sup></span> his mates;—‘Praises (stâvâ) by name,’—the offering-gifts are indeed praises, for the sacrifice is praised for offering-gifts; and whosoever gives an offering-gift (to priests) is praised;—‘may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!’ the meaning of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_4_1_1212"><sup><small>9:4:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘The lord of creatures, the all-worker,’—Pra<i>g</i>âpati (lord of creatures) is indeed the all-worker, for he has wrought all this (universe);—‘Manas (the mind) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes,’—as a Gandharva, the Mind indeed went forth, with the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes as the Apsaras, his mates;—‘Wishes (esh<i>t</i>i) by name,’—the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes are indeed wishes, for by verses and tunes people pray, ‘May this accrue unto us! may it fare thus with us!’—‘may he protect this our priest and nobility!’ 'the meaning of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_4_1_1313"><sup><small>9:4:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then makes an offering on the Head of the Chariot;—this, indeed, is that very rite of consecration,—and by that he is now consecrated,—which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those deities with whose permission he is consecrated [^395]; for he alone becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they do) not (allow to assume it). With ghee taken in five ladlings (he offers), and this is offered as five oblations: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_4_1_1414"><sup><small>9:4:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  On the head (or front part of the chariot the <span id="p234"><sup><small>[ p. 234 ]</small></sup></span> offering is made), for it is from the head (downwards) that he who is anointed is anointed,—whilst it is held above (the Âhavanîya), for above (others) is he who is thus anointed;—with the same formula (repeated each time), for one and the same (person) is he who is thus anointed;—whilst taking round (the chariot-head) in every direction [^396]: on every side he thus is anointed.

<span id="v9_4_1_1515"><sup><small>9:4:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he makes offering on the head of the chariot;—it is because this chariot is yonder sun; for it was by assuming that form that Pra<i>g</i>âpati enclosed those couples, and took them to himself, and made them his own; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby enclose them, and take them to himself, and make them his own. Whilst it (the chariot-head) is held above (the fire, he offers), for above (others) was he who, enclosing those couples, took them to himself, and made them his own;—and with the same formula, for one and the same is he who, by enclosing those couples, took them to himself, and made them his own.

<span id="v9_4_1_1616"><sup><small>9:4:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers each time, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 44\], ‘O Lord of the world, Lord of creatures!’—for this (Agni), indeed, is the lord of the world, and the lord of creatures;—‘thou whose dwellings are on high, or here below,’—both on high and <span id="p235"><sup><small>[ p. 235 ]</small></sup></span> here below, indeed, are his dwellings;—‘to this priesthood and this nobility of ours,’—for this Agni is both the priesthood and the nobility,—‘grant thou mighty protection, hail!’—that is, ‘grant thou powerful protection!’


<span id="v9_4_2"><sup><small>9:4:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v9_4_2_11"><sup><small>9:4:2:11.</small></sup></span>  He then offers (three) oblations of air;—this fire-altar is these (three) worlds, and the oblations of air are wind: he thus places the wind into these worlds, and hence there is wind here in these worlds.

<span id="v9_4_2_22"><sup><small>9:4:2:22.</small></sup></span>  He takes (the air) from outside the Vedi; for that wind which is in these worlds is already contained in this (fire-altar), and he now puts into it that wind which is beyond these worlds.

<span id="v9_4_2_33"><sup><small>9:4:2:33.</small></sup></span>  From outside the Vedi (he takes it),—for the Vedi is this (earth), and the wind which is on this (earth) is already contained in this (fire-altar): he now puts into it the wind which is beyond this (earth).

9:4:2:44 By his two hollow hands (he takes it), for only in this way is the catching of that (wind brought about). With the Svâhâ-call (he offers), for he offers just under the shafts (of the chariot),—this chariot is yonder sun: he thus places the wind on this side of the sun, and hence that one blows on this side thereof.

<span id="v9_4_2_55"><sup><small>9:4:2:55.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 45\], ‘Thou art the cloudy ocean,’—the cloudy ocean, doubtless, is yonder world (of the sky),—‘the giver of moisture,’—for that (wind) indeed gives moisture: he thus bestows on this (fire-altar) the wind which is in yonder world;—‘blow thou kindly and propitiously upon me, hail!’—that is, ‘blow favourably and gently upon me!’ <span id="p236"><sup><small>[ p. 236 ]</small></sup></span> 9:4:2:66\. ‘Thou art the stormy (region), the troop of the Maruts,’—the stormy (region), the troop of the Maruts, doubtless, is the air-world: he thus bestows on this (fire-altar) the wind which is in the air-world;—‘blow thou kindly and propitiously upon me, hail!’—that is, ‘blow favourably and gently upon me!’

<span id="v9_4_2_77"><sup><small>9:4:2:77.</small></sup></span>  ‘Thou art the one affording protection and worship,’—the one that affords protection and worship, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus bestows upon this (fire-altar) the wind which is in this world;—‘blow thou kindly and propitiously upon me, hail!’—that is, ‘blow favourably and gently upon me!’

<span id="v9_4_2_88"><sup><small>9:4:2:88.</small></sup></span>  With three (formulas) he offers,—three are these worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts air into these worlds.

<span id="v9_4_2_99"><sup><small>9:4:2:99.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he offers the oblations of air: he thereby yokes that chariot of his; for it was thereby that the gods yoked that chariot for (the obtainment of) all their wishes, thinking, ‘By it, when yoked, we shall obtain them;’ and by that yoked (chariot) they indeed obtained their wishes; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby yoke that chariot of his for (the obtainment of) all his wishes, thinking, ‘By it, when yoked, I shall obtain them;’ and by that yoked (chariot) he indeed obtains all his wishes.

<span id="v9_4_2_1010"><sup><small>9:4:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  He yokes it with the oblations of air [^397],—the oblations of air are the vital airs it is thus with the <span id="p237"><sup><small>[ p. 237 ]</small></sup></span> vital airs he yokes it [^398]. With three (oblations) he yokes it,—there are three vital airs, the out-breathing, up-breathing, and through-breathing: it is with these he thus yokes it. Just below the shaft (he offers), for just below the shaft the horse is yoked;—with his hands, for by the hands the horse is yoked;—in moving round [^399], for in moving round the horse is yoked.

<span id="v9_4_2_1111"><sup><small>9:4:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  The right yoke-horse he puts to first, then the left yoke-horse, then the right side-horse: for thus it is (done) among the gods, otherwise in human (practice). Let him not yoke that (chariot [^400]) again, lest he should yoke again the yoked one; but let him give away the vehicle, thinking, ‘I shall reap the benefit of the yoking of it [^401].’ They carry it as far as the Adhvaryu's dwelling, holding it right upwards, for above is that (Agni). He presents it to the Adhvaryu, for it is he that performs therewith. Let him, however, (not) assign it to him (till) the time of the offering-gifts.

<span id="v9_4_2_1212"><sup><small>9:4:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the ‘Lightsome [^402]’ oblations. <span id="p238"><sup><small>[ p. 238 ]</small></sup></span> For now the whole Agni was completed; he now wished for brilliance (ru<i>k</i>), and the gods, by means of these lightsome (oblations), endowed him with brilliance; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now endow him therewith.

<span id="v9_4_2_1313"><sup><small>9:4:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he offers the lightsome oblations. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was dismembered, his brilliance departed from him. When the gods restored him, they, by means of these lightsome oblations, endowed him with brilliance; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) endow him therewith.

<span id="v9_4_2_1414"><sup><small>9:4:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 46-48\], ‘O Agni, what lights of thine in the sun [^403] . . . ’ ‘O ye gods, what lights of yours are in the sun. . . [^403]’—‘Bestow thou light upon our priests, (work thou light in our kings, light in our people and <i>S</i>ûdras, bestow light upon me by thy light)!’ He thus says ‘light’ each time,—light is immortality: it is immortality he thus bestows upon him.

<span id="v9_4_2_1515"><sup><small>9:4:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  He then offers one relating to Varu<i>n</i>a. That whole Agni has now been completed, and he now is the deity Varu<i>n</i>a: it is to him that he offers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him (Agni) a deity, for that one alone is a deity to whom offering is made, but not that one to whom (offering is) not (made). With a verse addressed to Varu<i>n</i>a (he offers): he thus gratifies him by his own self, by his own deity.

<span id="v9_4_2_1616"><sup><small>9:4:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he offers one relating <span id="p239"><sup><small>[ p. 239 ]</small></sup></span> to Varu<i>n</i>a. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was dismembered, his strength departed from him. When the gods restored him they, by this (oblation), bestowed strength upon him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) bestow it upon him. With a verse addressed to Varu<i>n</i>a (he offers),—Varu<i>n</i>a is the ruling power, and ruling power means strength: it is thus by strength that he bestows strength upon him.

<span id="v9_4_2_1717"><sup><small>9:4:2:1717.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 49\], ‘For this I appeal to thee, worshipping thee with prayer,’—that is, ‘For that I beseech thee, worshipping thee with prayer;’—‘for this the Sacrificer imploreth thee with offerings,’—that is, 'for this, this Sacrificer implores thee with offerings;—‘without wrath listen thou here, O Varu<i>n</i>a!’—that is, ‘without anger listen thou here to us, O Varu<i>n</i>a!’—‘take not our life from us, O far-ruler!’—he thereby gives utterance to a surrender of his own self.

<span id="v9_4_2_1818"><sup><small>9:4:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  He then offers the Arkâ<i>s</i>vamedha-santati [^404] oblations. The light (arka), doubtless, is this fire (Agni), and the A<i>s</i>vamedha (horse-sacrifice) is yonder sun,—when created, these two were separate: by means of these oblations the gods drew them together and connected them; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), by means of these oblations, now draw them together and connect them.

<span id="v9_4_2_1919"><sup><small>9:4:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 50\], ‘Heaven-like heat, hail!’—the heat, doubtless, is yonder sun; he thus establishes yonder sun in Agni.

<span id="v9_4_2_2020"><sup><small>9:4:2:2020.</small></sup></span>  ‘Heaven-like flame, hail!’—the flame is <span id="p240"><sup><small>[ p. 240 ]</small></sup></span> this Agni: he thus establishes this Agni in yonder sun.

<span id="v9_4_2_2121"><sup><small>9:4:2:2121.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Heaven-like shining one, hail!’ the shining one, doubtless, is yonder sun: he places him again up there.

<span id="v9_4_2_2222"><sup><small>9:4:2:2222.</small></sup></span>  ‘Heaven -like light, hail!’—the light is this Agni: he places him again here (on the fire-altar).

<span id="v9_4_2_2323"><sup><small>9:4:2:2323.</small></sup></span>  ‘The heaven-like Sûrya, hail!’—Sûrya, doubtless, is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun highest of all this (universe), whence he is the highest of all this (universe).

<span id="v9_4_2_2424"><sup><small>9:4:2:2424.</small></sup></span>  These are five oblations he offers, the fire-altar consists of five layers, a year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus draws together and connects those two.

<span id="v9_4_2_2525"><sup><small>9:4:2:2525.</small></sup></span>  And as to why he says, ‘Heaven-like heat, hail! heaven-like flame, hail!’—these indeed are names of this fire: he thereby gratifies these, and by the offering he makes them a deity; for only that one is a deity to whom an oblation is offered, but not that to whom it is not offered. Moreover, by naming them, he thus places them on this fire-altar.

<span id="v9_4_2_2626"><sup><small>9:4:2:2626.</small></sup></span>  These are five oblations he offers,—the fire-altar consists of five layers, and the year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v9_4_2_2727"><sup><small>9:4:2:2727.</small></sup></span>  Now as to the insertion [^405] of (any other) oblations. If he should know any oblation supplied with a brâhma<i>n</i>a (dogmatic explanation) let him offer it at <span id="p241"><sup><small>[ p. 241 ]</small></sup></span> this time; for it is for (the obtainment of his) wishes that he yokes this chariot, and whatsoever oblation he offers on this occasion he offers as one that is (to be) fulfilled.

<span id="v9_4_2_2828"><sup><small>9:4:2:2828.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘Let him not offer (any additional oblations), lest he should do what is excessive.’ Let him, nevertheless, offer them; for it is for (special) wishes that these oblations are offered, and in wishes there is nothing excessive.


<span id="v9_4_3"><sup><small>9:4:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### PREPARATORY RITES OF THE SOMA-SACRIFICE.

<span id="v9_4_3_11"><sup><small>9:4:3:11.</small></sup></span>  Having now returned (to the hall), he, at the proper time, throws up the Dhish<i>n</i>yas [^406] (fire-hearths)—these hearths are fires: he thus builds up fire-altars. They are the clansmen, and the built-up fire-altar is the chieftaincy: he thus sets up both the chieftaincy and the clan. The former (altar) he builds up first, then these (hearths): thus he sets up the clan after setting up the chieftaincy.

<span id="v9_4_3_22"><sup><small>9:4:3:22.</small></sup></span>  That (fire-altar) is a single one: he thus makes the chieftaincy to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan. <span id="p242"><sup><small>[ p. 242 ]</small></sup></span> 9:4:3:33\. That (fire-altar) consists of five layers, the others of a single layer: he thus endows the chieftain (or, ruler) pre-eminently with power, and makes the chieftain more powerful than the clan (or people). Upwards he builds that one: he thus builds the ruling power upward by (social) layers; sideways the others: he thus makes the clan obedient to the chieftain from below.

<span id="v9_4_3_44"><sup><small>9:4:3:44.</small></sup></span>  That one he builds up both with the Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî (bricks laid down with a special formula), and with the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â (or space-filling ones, laid down with a common formula); the others with the space-filling one alone: he thus endows the chieftain pre-eminently with power, and makes the chieftain more powerful than the clan, and the clan less powerful than the chieftain.

<span id="v9_4_3_55"><sup><small>9:4:3:55.</small></sup></span>  And when he builds up these (hearths) only with the space-filling one, the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â being the nobility [^407]\—he thereby places the chieftain, as the eater, among the clan. He builds up (dhish<i>n</i>ya-hearths) both of the Soma-sacrifice [^408], and of the fire-altar; first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. Whatever Soma-hearth he (merely) throws up (at the Soma-sacrifice), that he (now) builds up. The Âgnîdhrîya he builds first, for that <span id="p243"><sup><small>[ p. 243 ]</small></sup></span> one he throws up first (at the Soma-sacrifice); (he does so) whilst sitting to the right (south) of it: the significance of this has been explained [^409].

<span id="v9_4_3_66"><sup><small>9:4:3:66.</small></sup></span>  On this (Âgnîdhrîya) he puts eight bricks,—the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. The variegated stone [^410] is the ninth of them: there are nine vital airs—seven in the head and two downward ones—it is these he thus puts into it. The fire which is placed on the erected (hearth) is the tenth;—there are ten vital airs [^411], and the Âgnîdhra is the middle (between the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fires).: he thus puts the vital airs in the middle of it; for the vital airs, being in the middle of the body, move along it in this direction, and in that direction.

<span id="v9_4_3_77"><sup><small>9:4:3:77.</small></sup></span>  Twenty-one he places on the Hotrîya (hearth), and there are twenty-one enclosing-stones [^412]: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_4_3_88"><sup><small>9:4:3:88.</small></sup></span>  Six (he places) on the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya,—these are the six seasons, the Fathers; for the seasons, the <span id="p244"><sup><small>[ p. 244 ]</small></sup></span> Fathers [^413], indeed, heaped up (a rampart) round that (fire) from the south. This one lies to the south of those (other hearths) [^414],—this (Âgnîdhrîya) he lays down in this way (direction), and these (other hearths) in this way, and that one (the Fire-altar) in this way: he thereby makes the peasantry look towards the chieftain.

<span id="v9_4_3_99"><sup><small>9:4:3:99.</small></sup></span>  He then encloses these (hearths) by enclosing-stones;—the enclosing-stones are the waters: it is thus by water that he surrounds them [^415]. He merely lays them down all round, for those of the waters which flow in a hollow (channel) are the chieftain, and these stray waters are the clansmen; thus, when he encloses that (great fire-altar) by a dug-in (row of stones), he thereby adds power to power, and sure rounds (protects) power by power; and when he merely lays down those (enclosing-stones of the hearths) all round, he thereby adds clansman (or clan) to clansman, and surrounds (protects) clansman by clansman [^416]. As many bricks with special formulas as <span id="p245"><sup><small>[ p. 245 ]</small></sup></span> there are (in each hearth) so many enclosing-stones there are (in each); for with that (fire-altar) there are as many enclosing-stones as there are such bricks in it [^417]: he thus makes the clan obedient and subservient to the chief.

<span id="v9_4_3_1010"><sup><small>9:4:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then scatters a layer of earth on (each of) these (hearths): the significance of this has been explained [^418]. Silently [^419] (he scatters it), for indistinct is the clan (or people). Then, after the cake-offering of the Agnîshomîya (animal sacrifice) [^420], he prepares the propitiatory oblations to the Regions;—that fire-altar is the regions: it is to them he offers these oblations, and thus by offering makes them a deity, for only that one is a deity to whom an oblation is offered, but not that to whom if is. not offered. There are five (such oblations), for there are five regions.

<span id="v9_4_3_1111"><sup><small>9:4:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say,—Let him prepare this <span id="p246"><sup><small>[ p. 246 ]</small></sup></span> offering (ish<i>t</i>i) so as to consist of material for ten oblations;—this (offering) is (performed) with all the stomas and all the p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a (sâmans) [^421]; and there are (used in it) all the metres, all the regions, all the seasons—and this Agni (the fire-altar) is all this: he thus, by the (amount of) offering material (taken out for the ish<i>t</i>i), makes (Agni) the deity [^422]; for only that one is the deity for whom the oblation is prepared, not one for whom it is not prepared. There are (in that case) ten (oblations),—the Virâ<i>g</i> (metre) consists of ten syllables, and Agni is virâ<i>g</i> (far-shining, or far-ruling); there are ten regions, and Agni (the fire-altar) is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v9_4_3_1212"><sup><small>9:4:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  But, indeed, he may also take out these oblations for the Divine Quickeners [^423]; for these are the deities which become consecrated by this consecration ceremony by which he is now to be consecrated: it is them he thus gratifies, and gratified by offering they permit him (to perform) this consecration ceremony, and with their permission he is <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume it). And inasmuch as these deities are consecrated (quickened) by this consecration ceremony and quicken him for this consecration, they are (called) the Divine Quickeners.

<span id="v9_4_3_1313"><sup><small>9:4:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  These (deities) come to have two. names, as he who is consecrated by the rite of consecration comes to have two names; for the very rite of consecration for which he is quickened, and by which he is consecrated (quickened), is his second name [^424].

<span id="v9_4_3_1414"><sup><small>9:4:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  There are eight (such deities),—the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v9_4_3_1515"><sup><small>9:4:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say,—He ought not to offer (any of) these oblations, lest he should do what is excessive. Let him nevertheless offer them; for these oblations are offered for (the obtainment of special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatsoever oblation he offers after the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a (the cake-offering connected with the animal sacrifice), that is placed inside the animal victim itself as its sacrificial sap [^425]. He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the fire-altar (or Agni<i>k</i>ayana), first those of the <span id="p248"><sup><small>[ p. 248 ]</small></sup></span> Soma-sacrifice, and afterwards those of the fire-altar the purport of this has been explained. In a loud voice [^426] the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a offering (is performed), in a low voice these (additional oblations), for they are an ish<i>t</i>i [^427]. With the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a he (the Adhvaryu) says, ‘Recite!—Urge!’ and with these (oblations), ‘Recite!—Worship [^428]’ for they are an ish<i>t</i>i. There is the same Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t and the same i<i>d</i>â [^429] (for these oblations). The (Devasû) deities have received offering, and the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (of the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a) has not yet been attended to [^430],— <span id="p249"><sup><small>[ p. 249 ]</small></sup></span> 9:4:3:1616\. He then touches it (the fire-altar) with (the formula of) the preliminary consecration (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 39. 40), ‘May Savit<i>ri</i> quicken thee for (powers of) quickening [1](Book_4_9_4#fn431)! . . . This (man), O ye (people), is your king; Soma is the king of us Brâhma<i>n</i>as!’—he thereby excludes the Brâhma<i>n</i>as (from the power of the king) and makes them such as are not to be fed upon (by the king).


## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### AGNIYO<i>G</i>ANA, OR YOKING OF THE FIRE-ALTAR; AND SOMA-SACRIFICE.

<span id="v9_4_4_11"><sup><small>9:4:4:11.</small></sup></span>  Then, early next morning [^432], when about to bespeak the morning prayer [^433], he yokes the Fire-altar, thinking, ‘With it, when yoked, I shall obtain;’ and by it, when yoked, he obtains all wishes. He <span id="p250"><sup><small>[ p. 250 ]</small></sup></span> yokes it prior to the whole performance, so that all that is done thereafter is laden on that yoked (altar-cart).

<span id="v9_4_4_22"><sup><small>9:4:4:22.</small></sup></span>  He yokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for those enclosing-sticks are fires [^434]: it is with fires he thus yokes the fire-altar.

<span id="v9_4_4_33"><sup><small>9:4:4:33.</small></sup></span>  Having touched the middle enclosing-stick [^435], he mutters this formula (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 51), ‘The Fire I yoke with might, with ghee!’—might means strength: thus, ‘The fire I yoke (furnish) with strength, with ghee;’—‘the heavenly bird, great in vigour,’—for that (fire-altar) is indeed a heavenly bird, and great in vigour, in smoke [^436];—‘Thereby we will go to the region of the bay, rising unto the light, beyond the highest firmament!’—The firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world: thus, ‘Thereby we will go to the region, of the bay (horse, the sun) mounting up to the heavenly world, beyond the highest firmament.’

<span id="v9_4_4_44"><sup><small>9:4:4:44.</small></sup></span>  Then on the southern (right) one, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 52), ‘By these never-decaying, feathered wings of thine wherewith thou repellest the demons, O Agni, may we fly to the world of the righteous whither the erst-born seers went of old!’ he thereby alludes to those <i>Ri</i>shis [^437]. <span id="p251"><sup><small>[ p. 251 ]</small></sup></span> 9:4:4:55\. Then on the northern (left) one, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 53), ‘The potent drop, the faithful eagle, the golden-winged bird, the active (bhura<i>n</i>yu),’—golden means immortal: thus, ‘the immortal-winged bird, the bearer (bhart<i>ri</i>);’—‘the mighty is seated in the firm seat: homage be to thee, injure me not!’—he thereby gives utterance to a surrender of his own self.

<span id="v9_4_4_66"><sup><small>9:4:4:66.</small></sup></span>  Now that middle formula is the body, and the two on both sides thereof are the wings (of the bird-shaped altar): hence these two allude to ‘wings [^438],’ for these two are the wings.

<span id="v9_4_4_77"><sup><small>9:4:4:77.</small></sup></span>  With three (formulas) he yokes it,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus yokes him.

<span id="v9_4_4_88"><sup><small>9:4:4:88.</small></sup></span>  And when he has pressed the king (Soma) he offers in the fire [^439]. This, indeed, is that very rite of consecration (or pressing)—and by that he is now consecrated (or pressed)—which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those deities with whose permission he is consecrated [^440]; for he alone becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they do) not (allow to assume it). Now when he offers in the fire he thereby consecrates (anoints) Agni, and that divine body of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality. And he himself drinks (thereof): he thereby consecrates <span id="p252"><sup><small>[ p. 252 ]</small></sup></span> himself, and this self (body) of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality.

<span id="v9_4_4_99"><sup><small>9:4:4:99.</small></sup></span>  Having offered in the fire (or, on the fire-altar), he drinks (Soma), for that (fire-altar) is his (the Sacrificer's) divine body [^441], and this (Sacrificer's real body) is his human one; and the gods indeed were first, and afterwards men: therefore, having offered (Soma) in the fire, he drinks (thereof).

<span id="v9_4_4_1010"><sup><small>9:4:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  Having now obtained the wish for (the accomplishment of) which he yokes it (the altar), he unyokes it when about to bespeak the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya stotra [^442],—for the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya is the heavenly world, and it is for the attainment of that (world) that he yokes it: thus (he unyokes it) after obtaining the wish for which he yoked it.

<span id="v9_4_4_1111"><sup><small>9:4:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  It is prior to the Stotra that he unyokes it:—were he to unyoke after the Stotra, he would pass beyond that world [^443] and lose it; but when he unyokes prior to the Stotra, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.

<span id="v9_4_4_1212"><sup><small>9:4:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  He unyokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for it <span id="p253"><sup><small>[ p. 253 ]</small></sup></span> is on the enclosing-sticks that he yokes it, and at whatever place (of the body) people yoke a horse there they also unyoke it.

<span id="v9_4_4_1313"><sup><small>9:4:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  Having touched it (the fire) at the two joints [^444], he mutters these two formulas,—thus two formulas equal in power three enclosing-sticks,—with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 54), 'The sky's head thou art, the earth's navel, \[the essence of the waters and plants, the life of all, the ample refuge (?): homage be to the path!\]' on the right, and with (55), ‘On the head of the All dost thou keep standing, \[in the (aerial) ocean is thy heart, in the waters thy life: bestow water, send the water-store (cloud),—from the sky, from the cloud, from the air, from the earth, favour us with rain!\]’ on the left (joint),—thus with two (verses) containing (the word) ‘head,’ for this, is indeed its head; and containing (the words) ‘in the waters [^445]’: that Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya doubtless is Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara's chant of praise, and water is (a means of) appeasing,—therefore (he touches them) with two (verses) containing (the words)—‘the waters.’

<span id="v9_4_4_1414"><sup><small>9:4:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  With two (verses) he unyokes it,—two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus unyokes him. With three (verses) he yokes,—that (makes) five,—the fire-altar consists of five layers, the year (of) five seasons, and Agni is <span id="p254"><sup><small>[ p. 254 ]</small></sup></span> the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great is this.

<span id="v9_4_4_1515"><sup><small>9:4:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  Now, some yoke it (the fire-altar) at a Prâya<i>n</i>îya [^446] Atirâtra, and unyoke it at an Udayanîya, saying, ‘The unyoking, surely, is a certain form of completion, and why should we perform a form of completion prior to the completion (of the sacrifice)?’ But let him not do this, for day by day this sacrifice is performed, and day by day it comes to completion; day by day he yokes that (altar) for the attainment of the heavenly world, and day by day he thereby attains the heavenly world: let him therefore yoke it day by day, and unyoke it day by day.

<span id="v9_4_4_1616"><sup><small>9:4:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  And, indeed, it would be just as if, at the Prâya<i>n</i>îya Atirâtra, after reciting the kindling-verses, he were to say, ‘Hereafter [^447], at the Udayanîya, I shall recite (them again)!’ Let him therefore yoke (the altar) day by day, and unyoke it day by day.

<span id="v9_4_4_1717"><sup><small>9:4:4:1717.</small></sup></span>  And on this point, <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya, indeed, having enjoined on the Kaṅkatîyas the day-by-day performance, <span id="p255"><sup><small>[ p. 255 ]</small></sup></span> went on his way, saying, ‘Day by day they shall yoke for you, and day by day they shall unyoke!’ Let him therefore yoke day by day, and unyoke day by day.

## Footnotes

[^395]: 230:1 This is apparently intended as an etymological explanation of the two names; Apsaras being taken as derived from ‘apsas,’ in the sense of ‘beauty.’ Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 135, note 3.

[^396]: 230:2 Or, perhaps, ‘he places the male above (the female) in respect of power;’ see [p. 133](Book_4_8_7#p133), note [1](Book_4_8_7#fn237).

[^397]: 231:1 In accordance with the preceding paragraph, that part of the formula which relates to the male deity, viz. ‘The law-upholding, law-abiding Agni is the Gandharva—may he protect this our priesthood and nobility: to him Svâhâ! Vâ<i>t</i>!’ is to be uttered first, and the first oblation to be offered at the call ‘Vâ<i>t</i>,’ i.e. Vasha<i>t</i>, ‘may he (Agni) carry it (to the gods)!’ Then that part relating to the female deities is uttered, after which the second oblation is offered. In the same way the other five formulas are to be treated. See Mahîdhara's remarks on the present formula.

[^398]: 231:2 Â-yuvânâ<i>h</i>, literally ‘holding to each other,’ a wrong etymology of ‘âyu,’ ‘lively.’

[^399]: 232:1 This etymological explanation of ‘bhekuri’ is doubtful.

[^400]: 232:2 The real meaning of bhu<i>g</i>yu in this passage is very doubtful; while it usually means ‘flexible,’ the St. Petersburg Dictionary here tentatively assigns to it the meaning ‘adder.’ Whether the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a really connects it with ‘bhu<i>g</i> (bhunakti),’ ‘to enjoy, benefit’ (instead of with ‘bhu<i>g</i>,’ ‘to bend’); or whether the explanation is merely meant as an etymological play of words, is not clear. Mahîdhara indeed derives it from the former root, in the sense of ‘to protect.’ The order of the words ‘ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>o vai bhu<i>g</i>yu<i>h</i>’ would properly require to be rendered by—The ‘bhu<i>g</i>yu’ doubtless is the sacrifice.

[^401]: 233:1 The construction of the text (occurring again at [IX, 4, 4, 8](Book_4_9_4#v9_4_4_8)) is rather irregular.

[^402]: 234:1 The body (or ‘nest,’ seat-part) of the chariot is shifted sunwise round the fire on the great altar, so that the fore-part keeps over the fire where the Adhvaryu's assistant holds it, and in each of the four directions, as well as in the centre of the fire, the Adhvaryu offers a libation of ghee, whilst facing the chariot-head. According to a comment on the respective rules (Kâty. XVIII, 5, 17-20) alluded to by Prof. Weber (Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 286), the fore-part of the chariot would, however, seem to be taken off the seat-part; the latter being carried round the fire as the oblations are made.

[^403]: 236:1 That is, these oblations are, as it were, to represent the team of the chariot.

[^404]: 237:1 Or, he supplies him (Agni).

[^405]: 237:2 According to Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XVIII, 6, 1, 2, the Adhvaryu first takes a double handful of air from beyond the east side of the Vedi, and offers it below the right (south) shaft; then from beyond the north side to be offered up below the left shaft, and lastly from beyond the south side to be offered below the shaft where the right side-horse would be yoked. In each case the girth (or yoke-tie) is to be carried round in the same way as if a real horse were yoked.

[^406]: 237:3 Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it to mean ‘that horse’; and according to Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XVIII, 6, 3-5, the carriage is to be carried to the Adhvaryu's house, and, at the time when the dakshi<i>n</i>âs are presented to the priests, it is to be given to that priest along with three horses. The Brâhma<i>n</i>a, however, does not seem to mention the horses.

[^407]: 237:4 Literally, of the yoked one.

[^408]: 237:5. These oblations are here called ‘ruṅmatî,’ because the three p. 238 verses used with them contain the word ‘ru<i>k</i>,’ being prayers for the bestowal of light.

[^410]: 238:1 These two verses had already been used in laying down the Dviya<i>g</i>us bricks; see VII, 4, 2, 21.

[^411]: 239:1 That is, the joining together of the fire and the horse-sacrifice.

[^412]: 240:1 Or, location, proper place; cf. [p. 138](Book_4_8_7#p138), note [1](Book_4_8_7#fn245).

[^413]: 241:1 A Soma-sacrifice being about to be performed on the newly erected fire-altar, now properly consecrated, all the necessary preparatory business and ceremonial enjoined for such a sacrifice have now to be gone through in the way detailed in part ii of this translation. The author here only alludes to those points in the Soma-ritual in regard to which the present performance offers any special feature either additional to, or modificatory of, the ordinary ceremonial. The construction of the Dhish<i>n</i>yas, or fire-hearths of the different priests (for which see part ii, p. 148, note 4), is one of these points.

[^414]: 242:1 See [p. 132](Book_4_8_7#p132), note [2](Book_4_8_7#fn235).

[^415]: 242:2 There are eight dhish<i>n</i>ya-hearths at the Soma-sacrifice, two of which, the Âgnîdhrîya and Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya, were raised north and south of the cart-shed (havirdhâna), whilst the others (viz. those of the Hot<i>ri</i>, &c.) were raised inside the Sadas along its eastern side. They were merely mounds of earth covered with sand, whilst the additional hearths (of the fire-altar) now to be erected are partly built of bricks.

[^416]: 243:1 See VII, 1, 1, 21 seq., where the way in which the bricks of the Gârhapatya hearth are laid down is described in detail.

[^417]: 243:2 When Agni was led forwards from the Gârhapatya to be installed on his newly built altar, as the Âhavanîya or offering fire, a variegated stone, meant to represent the sun, was deposited near the place (on the northern edge of the Vedi) where the Âgnîdhra shed and hearth would afterwards have to be erected; see [IX, 2, 3, 14](Book_4_9_2#v9_2_3_14)\-[19](Book_4_9_2#v9_2_3_19).

[^418]: 243:3 That is, including the central one, the outlet of which is the navel; cf. [VIII, 1, 3, 10](Book_4_8_1#v8_1_3_10).

[^419]: 243:4 The numbers of bricks and enclosing-stones are the same as for the Gârhapatya hearth, for which (with their symbolic meaning) see VII, I, I, 32-35.

[^420]: 244:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a refers to a passage in the Taittirîyaka, according to which a dying man is changed to whatever season he dies in, whence the six seasons are the representatives of all the deceased ancestors. Since the Fathers reside in the southern region it is from that quarter that, by laying down the bricks, they are supposed to raise a rampart for the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya fire.

[^421]: 244:2 Viz. on the southern edge of the Vedi, exactly south of the Âgnîdhrîya, whilst the other dhish<i>n</i>yas run in a line from north to south to the left of the space between the Âgnîdhrîya and Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya. The other hearths, together with the great fire-altar occupying the eastern part of the Vedi, would thus, as it were, face the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya in a semicircle. See the plan of the Sacrificial ground, part ii, p. 475.

[^422]: 244:3 That is, as the earth is surrounded by the ocean (VII, 1, 1, 13), or a stronghold by a moat.

[^423]: 244:4 Viz. inasmuch as the fire-altar and the Âhavanîya fire on it, as p. 245 well as the dug-in circle of enclosing-stones, are identified with the ruling power; whilst the dhish<i>n</i>yas as well as the circles of stones lying loosely around them represent the clan.

[^424]: 245:1 This is not clear to me: whilst there are 395 such bricks with special formulas in the five layers of the great altar, it is enclosed by only 261 pari<i>s</i>rits; see [p. 158](Book_4_9_1#p158), note [1](Book_4_9_1#fn264). Besides there are no ‘ya<i>g</i>ushmatî’ bricks in these hearths, but only ‘lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs’; one would therefore expect ‘ish<i>t</i>akâs’ (bricks) for ‘ya<i>g</i>ushmatyas’ the first time (cf. comm. on Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XVIII, 7, 13). The Hot<i>ri</i>'s hearth contains twenty-one bricks, the Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>_kh<i>a</i>m_sin's eleven, the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya six, and the others eight bricks; and in each case the common formula, ‘Lokam p<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a, &c,’ (see [VIII, 7, 2, 6](Book_4_8_7#v8_7_2_6)), is pronounced once after every ten bricks, and after any odd bricks remaining over at the end. Cf. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XVIII, 6, 8 seq.

[^425]: 245:2 See [VIII, 7, 3, 1](Book_4_8_7#v8_7_3_1) seq.

[^426]: 245:3 He does not use any such formula as that used in covering each layer of the great altar with earth; see [VIII, 7, 3, 7](Book_4_8_7#v8_7_3_7).

[^427]: 245:4 See part ii, p. 199, note 2 (where the reference at the end should be to IV, 2, 5, 22).

[^428]: 246:1 See part iii, introduction, p. xx seq.

[^429]: 246:2 As Sâya<i>n</i>a points out, the Taittirîyas make Agni the deity of this ish<i>t</i>i, the invitatory formulas (puroऽnuvâkyâ) of the different havis (oblations) naming him each time with different epithets relating to different metres, stomas, p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as, and seasons. Cf. Taitt. S. I, 8, 4: Taitt. Br. I, 8, 19.

[^430]: 246:3 For these eight deities (Savit<i>ri</i> Satyaprasava, Agni G<i>ri</i>hapati, &c.), to whom offering is made at the Abhishe<i>k</i>anîya or Consecration ceremony of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, between the chief oblation of the animal cake-offering (Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a) and its Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, whilst the whole of the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a is again performed in the middle of the animal sacrifice, see part iii, p. 69 seq.

[^431]: 247:1 That is to say, for example, he who has performed the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya is called Vâ<i>g</i>apeya-yâ<i>g</i>in, Sây.

[^432]: 247:2 These oblations, as well as those of the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a, inserted as they are in the middle of the animal offering,—just after the offering of the omentum of the victim,—are supposed to supply to the victim its sacrificial sap or essence which was taken out of it in the shape of the omentum. See III, 8, 3, 2.

[^433]: 248:1 That is, in the formulas the name of the deity to whom the oblation is offered is pronounced in a loud voice.

[^434]: 248:2 That is, a ‘kâmyesh<i>t</i>i,’ or offering for the obtainment of some special object, which has to be performed in a low voice; see I, 3, 5, 10.

[^435]: 248:3 Or, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer!’ For these two latter calls (anubrûhi!—ya<i>g</i>a!), by which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot<i>ri</i> to pronounce the invitatory prayer (anuvâkyâ or puroऽnuvâkyâ) and the offering-prayer (yâ<i>g</i>yâ) respectively, at ish<i>t</i>is, see I, 5, 2, 8-10 and I, 5, 3, 8; and for the first two (anubrûhi!—preshya!), by the former of which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot<i>ri</i> to recite the invitatory prayer; whilst by the latter he calls on the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a to ‘urge’ (or prompt') the Hot<i>ri</i> to pronounce the offering-prayer at the animal sacrifice, see III, 8, 1, 4 with note (where attention might have been called to the difference that exists between the ish<i>t</i>i and the animal sacrifice in regard to the formula by which the Adhvaryu calls for the recitation of the offering-prayer). In regard to this point there is, however, a difference of opinion between the Mâdhyandina and the Kâ<i>n</i>va schools, the latter using for the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a on this occasion, as well as on that of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, the same calls as those of the inserted ish<i>t</i>is; cf. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XV, 4, 18-20.

[^436]: 248:4 For the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, or oblation to Agni, ‘the maker of good offering,’ offered after the chief oblations, see I, 7, 3, 1 seq.; for the i<i>d</i>â-oblation (and invocation of I<i>d</i>â), I, 8, 1, 1 seq.

[^437]: 248:5 The tentative meaning assigned to ‘asamavahitam,’ ‘not in immediate connection with (the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t),’ can scarcely be right. The clause seems simply to mean that the (pûrvâbhisheka) touching p. 249 of the altar is to take place, as in the case of the (preliminary) consecration at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, immediately after the oblations to the Divine Quickeners, and before the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t oblation of the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a has been performed. See V, 3, 3, 50, where a somewhat similar expression is used. One might have some doubt as to whether, both here and at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, there is any Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t at all to these Devasû-havî<i>m</i>shi, or whether the statement, ‘There is the same svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t and the same i<i>d</i>â,’ applies not to them merely, but to them and the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a. If this latter alternative were the correct one, we should, however, expect that something had been said on this point in connection with the Devasû oblations of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya; and moreover the nature of the two oblations seems too different for such a partial identification, requiring as they do different ‘praishas,’ or calls, in the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (viz. ‘ya<i>g</i>a’ the one, and ‘preshya’ the other); see also [IX, 5, 1, 40](Book_4_9_5#v9_5_1_40), and note [^428], [p. 248](#p248); also Kâty. <i>S</i>r. V, II, 23-24.

[^438]: 249:1 For the complete formulas, see V, 3, 3, 11, 12.

[^439]: 249:2 That is, on the first Sutyâ, or pressing-day.

[^440]: 249:3 That is, by calling on the Hot<i>ri</i> to ‘Recite to the gods, the early coming!’ see III, 9, 3, 10, with note thereto giving particulars regarding the Prâtaranuvâka.

[^441]: 250:1 See the ritual legend, I, 3, 3, 13 seq.

[^442]: 250:2 That is, the one along the hind (or west) side of the Âhavanîya fire on the great altar, being the base of the triangle formed by the three enclosing-sticks. The order in which they are touched is the same as that in which they were laid down.

[^443]: 250:3 Mahîdhara actually takes ‘smoke (dhûma)’ here to be intended as the literal meaning of ‘vayas.’

[^444]: 250:4 Viz. the seven <i>Ri</i>shis, identified with the seven vital airs which came to constitute the first Purusha (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati), and hence the bird-shaped fire-altar. See VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.

[^445]: 251:1 In the first formula the word for ‘bird (eagle)’ is ‘supar<i>n</i>a,’ literally ‘the well-winged (well-feathered) one.’

[^446]: 251:2 This refers to the libations made from the several cups (grahas), the contents of which are afterwards consumed by the priests (and Sacrificer); cf. part ii, p. 316, note 1.

[^447]: 251:3 For the same irregular construction, see [IX, 4, 1, 13](Book_4_9_4#v9_4_1_13).

[^448]: 252:1 See [IX, 3, 4, 12](Book_4_9_3#v9_3_4_12).

[^449]: 252:2 The Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya (or Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya) stotra is the last and characteristic chant of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma mode of Soma-sacrifice, whence it is more properly called Agnish<i>t</i>oma-sâman; the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya, properly speaking, being the verses, Sâma-v. II, 53, 54, chanted to a particular tune, and generally (though not always) used for the closing chant of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma.

[^450]: 252:3 That is, because the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya marks, as it were, the end of the (Agnish<i>t</i>oma) Soma-sacrifice, and anything performed thereafter is, so to speak, outside the sacrifice, or beyond it. Katy. <i>S</i>r. XVIII, 6, 17 calls it Âgnimâruta stotra, i.e. the chant belonging to the Âgnimâruta-<i>s</i>astra (which has to be recited by the Hot<i>ri</i> after that chant); cf. part ii, p. 369 note.

[^451]: 253:1 That is, at the two points where the right (southern) and left (northern) enclosing-sticks (forming the two sides of the triangle, the apex of which lies east of the centre of the fire) meet the western enclosing-stick (as the base of the triangle).

[^452]: 253:2 The first verse, in point of fact, contains the genitive case ‘of the waters.’

[^453]: 254:1 For the Prâya<i>n</i>îya ish<i>t</i>i (to five deities) of the ordinary Agnish<i>t</i>oma, see part ii, pp. 47, 48, note. In the present case a special Soma-sacrifice of the Atirâtra type would seem to take its place, just as the Pavitra, an Agnish<i>t</i>oma Soma-sacrifice, at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, took the place of the ordinary Anvârambha<i>n</i>îyâ ish<i>t</i>i (or opening offering); see part iii, p. 42. In the same way there would apparently be a special Udayanîya Soma-sacrifice; whilst our author would have the ceremonies of yoking and unyoking of the fire-altar performed on the very day (or days) of the Soma-sacrifice, that is to say, he would have the ordinary Prâya<i>n</i>îyesh<i>t</i>i and Udayanîyesh<i>t</i>i performed as parts of the principal Soma-day (or days, if there are to be more than one).

[^454]: 254:2 Or, therefore, as Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it. If the Udayanîya were a special Soma-sacrifice, the Sâmidhenîs (part i, p. 102 seq.; ii, p. 13, note 3) would have to be recited anew.
