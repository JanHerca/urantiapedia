## SEVENTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_7_1_11"><sup><small>6:7:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He hangs a gold plate (round his neck), and wears it; for that gold plate is the truth, and the truth is able to sustain that (fire [^503]): by means of the truth the gods carried it, and by means of the truth does he now carry it.

<span id="v6_7_1_22"><sup><small>6:7:1:22.</small></sup></span>  Now that truth is the same as yonder sun. It is a gold (plate), for gold is light, and he (the sun) is the light; gold is immortality, and he is immortality. It (the plate) is round, for he (the sun) is round. It has twenty-one knobs, for he is the twenty-first [^504]. He wears it with the knobs outside, for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays arc outside. <span id="p266"><sup><small>[ p. 266 ]</small></sup></span> 6:7:1:33\. And as to why he puts on and wears the gold plate;—that plate is yonder sun, and man, in his human form, is unable to sustain that fire: it is only in this (solar or divine) form that he bears that (divine) form.

<span id="v6_7_1_44"><sup><small>6:7:1:44.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts on and wears the gold plate;—this fire is seed poured out here; and the gold plate means vital energy (or brilliance) and vigour: he thus lays vital energy and vigour into that seed.

<span id="v6_7_1_55"><sup><small>6:7:1:55.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he puts on and wears the gold plate;—the gods now were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should destroy here that (Agni) of theirs. They made that (plate), yonder sun, to be his (Agni's) protector (standing) by his side, for the gold plate is yonder sun: and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now make that (plate) to be his (Agni's) protector by his side.

<span id="v6_7_1_66"><sup><small>6:7:1:66.</small></sup></span>  It is sown up in a black antelope's skin; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is able to sustain that (Agni): by means of the sacrifice the gods carried him, and by means of the sacrifice he now carries him;—with the hair (inside), for the hair are the metres, and the metres are indeed able to sustain him: by the metres the gods carried him, and by the metres he now carries him.

<span id="v6_7_1_77"><sup><small>6:7:1:77.</small></sup></span>  It is sown into the white and black hair, for these two are forms of the <i>ri</i><i>k</i> (hymn-verse) and the sâman (hymn-tune), and the <i>ri</i><i>k</i> and sâman are indeed able to sustain him (Agni): by the <i>ri</i><i>k</i> and sâman the gods carried him, and by the <i>ri</i><i>k</i> and sâman he now carries him. The hempen sling of the gold plate is a triple (cord): the significance of this has been explained. <span id="p267"><sup><small>[ p. 267 ]</small></sup></span> 6:7:1:88\. He wears it over the navel; for that gold plate is yonder sun, and he (stands) over the navel (of the earth or sky).

<span id="v6_7_1_99"><sup><small>6:7:1:99.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why over the navel,—below the navel is the seed, the power of procreation, and the gold plate represents vital energy and vigour: (he does so, thinking,) ‘Lest the gold plate burn up my seed, my power of procreation, my vital energy and vigour.’

<span id="v6_7_1_1010"><sup><small>6:7:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why over the navel;—sacrificially purer is that part of the animal (victim) which is above the navel, and more in contact with ordure is that which is below the navel: he thus carries it (the plate) by means of that part of the animal which is sacrificially purer.

<span id="v6_7_1_1111"><sup><small>6:7:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why over the navel,—that part of the vital air which is immortal is above the navel, and streams out by upward breathings; but that which is mortal passes by and away from the navel: he thus makes him (the Sacrificer) obtain the part of the vital air which is immortal, and by that he then carries it (the fire).

<span id="v6_7_1_1212"><sup><small>6:7:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  Now, he carries that (fire in the pan) on a seat;—the seat (âsandî) doubtless is this earth, for on her everything here is settled (âsanna); and she indeed is able to sustain him (Agni): it was thereby that the gods carried him, and thereby he now carries him.

<span id="v6_7_1_1313"><sup><small>6:7:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  It is made of udumbara wood (ficus glomerata), for the Udumbara tree is sustenance (sustaining strength), life-sap: by means of sustenance, life-sap, he thus carries him. Moreover, that Udumbara represents all the trees here (on earth), and all the trees (together) are capable of sustaining that (fire): <span id="p268"><sup><small>[ p. 268 ]</small></sup></span> by means of all the trees the gods bore (or, maintained) it, and by means of all the trees does he now bear it.

<span id="v6_7_1_1414"><sup><small>6:7:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  It (the seat) is a span high; for Vish<i>n</i>u, as an embryo, was a span high: he thus makes the womb equal in size to the embryo. It is a cubit across; for the cubit is (the length of) the (fore-)arm, and strength is exerted by the arm. It thus is made equal to strength, and strength is indeed capable of sustaining him (Agni): by means of strength the gods did bear him, and by means of strength does he now bear him.

<span id="v6_7_1_1515"><sup><small>6:7:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  The feet and boards [^505] are four-cornered; for there are four regions, and the regions are able to sustain him: by means of the regions the gods bore him, and by the regions does he now bear him. It is interwoven with cords of reed-grass, triple ones,—the significance of this has been explained;—and smeared over with clay,—(the significance) of this also has been explained; but it also serves to keep them from taking fire [^506].

<span id="v6_7_1_1616"><sup><small>6:7:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  Now he carries him (Agni, the fire) by means of a netting [^507]\—he, Agni, is these worlds, and the netting is the regions, for by means of the regions these worlds are able to stand; and inasmuch as they are so able (<i>s</i>ak), it is called a netting (<i>s</i>ikya): he thus carries him by means of the regions. It is furnished with six strings,—for there are six <span id="p269"><sup><small>[ p. 269 ]</small></sup></span> regions;—made of reed-grass, triply wound—the significance of this has been explained;—and smeared with clay—(the significance) of this also has been explained; but it also serves to keep them from taking fire.

<span id="v6_7_1_1717"><sup><small>6:7:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  The waters are his (Agni's) foundation, for on the waters these worlds are founded. The sun is the connecting link [^508], for to the sun these worlds are linked by means of the quarters: whosoever thus knows this, carries suchlike a one by suchlike a one [^509].

<span id="v6_7_1_1818"><sup><small>6:7:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he carries him by means of a netting,—he, Agni, is the year, and the netting is the seasons; for by means of the seasons the year is able to exist, and inasmuch as it is so able (<i>s</i>ak), therefore (the netting is called) ‘<i>s</i>ikya:’ he thus carries him by the seasons. It is furnished with six strings, for there are six seasons.

<span id="v6_7_1_1919"><sup><small>6:7:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  Day and night are his foundation, for on day and night this year is founded. The moon is the connecting link, for to the moon this year is linked by means of the seasons: whosoever thus knows this, carries suchlike a one by suchlike a one. And verily by him who so knows this, he (Agni) is carried for a year; and by him who does not so know it, he is attended to for a year [^510]. Thus as to the deities,— <span id="p270"><sup><small>[ p. 270 ]</small></sup></span> 6:7:1:2020\. Now as to the self (or body of Agni). Agni doubtless is the self, and the netting is the vital airs, for by means of the vital airs that self is able to exist; and inasmuch as it is so able (<i>s</i>ak) therefore (the netting is called) ‘<i>s</i>ikya:’ he thus carries (sustains) him by means of the vital airs; and it is furnished with six strings, because there are six vital airs.

<span id="v6_7_1_2121"><sup><small>6:7:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  The mind is his foundation, for on the mind this body is founded,—and food is the connecting link, for to food this body is linked by means of the vital airs: whosoever thus knows this, carries suchlike (Agni) by suchlike means.

<span id="v6_7_1_2222"><sup><small>6:7:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  Now he carries him by means of the fire-pan; for the pan is these worlds, and these worlds are indeed able to hold him: by means of these worlds the gods carried him, and by means of them he (the Sacrificer) now carries him.

<span id="v6_7_1_2323"><sup><small>6:7:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  And as to why it is called ‘Ukhâ;’—by means of this sacred performance and this process the gods at that time dug out these worlds; and inasmuch as they so dug out (ut-khan), it (the pan representing the worlds) is called ‘utkhâ,’—‘utkhâ’ being what they mysteriously (esoterically) call ‘ukhâ,’ for the gods love the mysterious.

<span id="v6_7_1_2424"><sup><small>6:7:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  Now ‘ukhâ’ (consists of) two syllables,—the Sacrificer is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus carries him. And that same (pan) is a pot (kumbhî), it is a cauldron (sthâlî) [^511]; this <span id="p271"><sup><small>[ p. 271 ]</small></sup></span> makes six (syllables),—six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

<span id="v6_7_1_2525"><sup><small>6:7:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  He now takes hold of him (Agni [^512]) by means of two (straw) pads [^513]; for he, Agni, is yonder sun, and the two pads are day and night he thus takes hold of yonder sun by means of the day and the night, and hence that (sun) [^514] is encompassed by day and night.

<span id="v6_7_1_2626"><sup><small>6:7:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he takes hold of him by means of two pads,—he, Agni, is yonder sun, and the two pads are these two worlds: he thus encompasses yonder sun by these two worlds, and hence he is encompassed by these two worlds. They are round, for these two worlds are round; of reed-grass, triply wound,—the significance of this has been told;—and smeared with clay,—(the significance) of this also has been told, but it also serves to keep them from taking fire.

<span id="v6_7_1_2727"><sup><small>6:7:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  Now then the (mystic) correspondence (of the number of objects to the nature of Agni),—the seat, the fire-pan, the sling of the gold plate, the fire, and the gold plate,—these amount to six;—six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. Two pads, that makes eight,—the Gâyatrî has eight syllables, and Agni is Gâyatra as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> 6:7:1:2828\. Now the total correspondence,—four feet and four boards (of the seat), the netting, and the sling of the gold plate, or any other corded netting; after that the pan and fire, and the gold plate,—that makes thirteen;—thirteen months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.


<span id="v6_7_2"><sup><small>6:7:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_7_2_11"><sup><small>6:7:2:11.</small></sup></span>  Standing he puts on that (gold plate) [^515],—for that gold plate is yonder sun, and yonder sun stands, as it were; and moreover, while standing one is stronger. \[He does so\] standing with his face towards north-east: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v6_7_2_22"><sup><small>6:7:2:22.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 1; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 45, 8\] ‘Looking like [^516] a golden disk he hath shone far and wide,’—for that gold plate, being seen, indeed shines far and wide;—‘flashing forth unquenchable [^517] life for glory,’—for not easily dying is his (Agni's) life (vital power); and for glory he does shine;—‘Agni became immortal by his powers, when Dyaus bore him—,’ for Dyaus (the sky) did bear him;—‘she that hath good seed—,’ for good seed indeed she has whose seed he (Agni) is.

<span id="v6_7_2_33"><sup><small>6:7:2:33.</small></sup></span>  He then takes hold of him by means of the two pads, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 2 [^518]), ‘Night and Dawn, <span id="p273"><sup><small>[ p. 273 ]</small></sup></span> of one mind, unlike in form,’—night and dawn, doubtless, are day and night, (and they are) of one mind [^519], and unlike in form;—‘nourish one child, combining together,’—whatever belongs to the day and the night, therewith they, combining together, indeed nourish him (Agni);—‘a golden disk, he shineth between heaven and earth,’—whilst taking it (the fire), he mutters this prayer; for heaven and earth are those two, the sky and the earth; and moving between these two he shines: that is why, in taking it, he mutters this prayer;—‘the wealth-giving gods kept Agni;’—therewith, having taken hold of it in both hands, he sets it down; for the wealth-giving gods are the vital airs, and they indeed kept up Agni at first: by means of them he now keeps him up.

<span id="v6_7_2_44"><sup><small>6:7:2:44.</small></sup></span>  He then puts round his (neck) the sling of the netting, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 3; <i>Ri</i>k S. V, 81, 2), ‘The wise putteth on all forms,’—the wise one, doubtless, is yonder sun, and the netting is all forms;—‘he hath brought forth what is good for the two-footed and four-footed,’—for in rising he does bring forth what is good for the two-footed and four-footed;—‘the adorable Savit<i>ri</i> hath glanced over the firmament,’—the firmament, doubtless, is the heaven, and even in rising he looks along it;—‘he flasheth forth after the starting [^520] of the Dawn,’—for the Dawn shines forth first, and after her shining forth he (the sun) follows, flashing forth.

<span id="v6_7_2_55"><sup><small>6:7:2:55.</small></sup></span>  By means of the fashioning (formula) he then fashions him out of that (matter): he thereby <span id="p274"><sup><small>[ p. 274 ]</small></sup></span> fashions that infused seed, whence the seed infused into the womb is fashioned.

<span id="v6_7_2_66"><sup><small>6:7:2:66.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 4\] ‘A well-winged bird thou art!’—the well-winged bird means vigour: he thus forms him so as to be (endowed with) vigour;—‘the Triv<i>ri</i>t is thy head,’—he thus makes the Triv<i>ri</i>t stoma (nine-versed hymn) his head;—‘the Gâyatra thine eye,’—he thus makes the Gâyatrî metre his eye;—‘the B<i>ri</i>hat and Rathantara thy wings,’—he thus makes the B<i>ri</i>hat and Rathantara (hymn-tunes) his wings;—‘the hymn is the self,’—the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a stoma (twenty-five-versed hymn) he makes the self (soul, or body);—‘the metres the limbs,’—for the metres are indeed his (Agni's) limbs;—‘the prayers his name,’—the prayers (ya<i>g</i>us) are his name ‘Agni’ by which they call him,—‘the Vâmadevya sâman is thy body,’—the body, doubtless, is the self: thus 'the Vâmadevya (hymn-tune) is thy body, thy self; ‘the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya thy tail,’—he thus makes the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>iya [^521] his tail;—‘the hearths thy hoofs,’—by means of the hearths he (Agni) is indeed established in this world;—‘thou art a well-winged bird: go to the heaven! fly to the light!’—thus having made him a well-winged [^522], bird he says, 'Go to the gods! fly to the heavenly world!

<span id="v6_7_2_77"><sup><small>6:7:2:77.</small></sup></span>  He fashions him here (in the pan or womb) into (a bird) with wings and tail; for whatlike the seed is fashioned in the womb, suchlike it is born; and because he here fashions him as (a bird) with <span id="p275"><sup><small>[ p. 275 ]</small></sup></span> wings and tail, therefore he is hereafter born with wings and tail.

<span id="v6_7_2_88"><sup><small>6:7:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Now some, after addressing him by that fashioning (formula), build a different altar (than of an eagle's shape), either one constructed in the form of a trough [^523], or like a chariot-wheel, or like a kite, or like the front part of a thill, or like a thill on both sides, or one consisting of a heap of loose soil [^524]. Let him not do so, (but) in such wise as one might carve a young one with wings and tail: let him therefore build it (the fire-altar) in the form of an eagle.

<span id="v6_7_2_99"><sup><small>6:7:2:99.</small></sup></span>  With that fashioning (formula) he holds him high up from thence towards east [^525]; for he, Agni, is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun high up from here in the east; and hence yonder sun is placed high up from here in the east. He holds him up so as to be beyond the reach of the arms, for he (the sun) is beyond the reach of the arms from here. He then lowers him, and, having lowered him, he holds him above the navel: the significance of this has been explained [^526].

<span id="v6_7_2_1010"><sup><small>6:7:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  He then strides the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides [^527]. For the gods, in the form of Vish<i>n</i>u (the sun), then strode through these worlds; and inasmuch as, in the form of Vish<i>n</i>u, they thus strode, they are called the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides: in like manner does the Sacrificer, <span id="p276"><sup><small>[ p. 276 ]</small></sup></span> in the form of Vish<i>n</i>u, now stride through these worlds.

<span id="v6_7_2_1111"><sup><small>6:7:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  Now he who is Vish<i>n</i>u is this sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is that same Agni in the ukhâ (fire-pan): into that same (Agni) the gods changed themselves, and strode through these worlds; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having changed himself into that same (Agni), strides through these worlds.

<span id="v6_7_2_1212"><sup><small>6:7:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  Standing with his face towards north-east (he strides); for standing towards north-east Pra<i>g</i>âpati created offspring by means of the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides: in like manner does the Sacrificer now, standing towards north-east, create offspring by means of the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides.

<span id="v6_7_2_1313"><sup><small>6:7:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 5\] 'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's stride,'—for in the form of Vish<i>n</i>u he strides; ‘the slayer of foes;’—for he now slays his foes;—‘mount thou the Gâyatrî metre,’—the Gâyatrî metre he does mount,—‘stride along the earth!’—along the earth he indeed strides. He stretches forward his (right) foot and strides: he raises the fire upwards, for upwards he ascends.

<span id="v6_7_2_1414"><sup><small>6:7:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's stride,'—for in the form of Vish<i>n</i>u he strides;—‘the slayer of plotters,’—for he now does slay the plotters;—‘mount thou the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre!’—the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre he does mount;—‘stride along the air!’—along the air he indeed strides. He stretches forward his foot and strides: he raises the fire (yet further) upwards, for upwards he ascends.

<span id="v6_7_2_1515"><sup><small>6:7:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's stride,'—for in the form of Vish<i>n</i>u he strides;—‘the slayer of the evil-minded,’—for he now does slay the evil-minded;— <span id="p277"><sup><small>[ p. 277 ]</small></sup></span> ‘Mount the <i>G</i>agatî metre!’—for the <i>G</i>agatî metre he does mount;—‘stride along the sky!’—along the sky he indeed strides. He stretches his foot forward and strides: he raises the fire (yet further) upwards, for upwards he ascends.

<span id="v6_7_2_1616"><sup><small>6:7:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  'Thou art Vish<i>n</i>u's stride,'—for in the form of Vish<i>n</i>u he strides;—‘the slayer of the hostile,’—for he now does slay the hostile;—‘mount thou the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre!’—the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre he does mount;—‘stride along the quarters!’—he looks along the (four) quarters; he does not stretch forward his foot, thinking, ‘Lest I lose these worlds!’—He raises the fire right up, for he ascends completely (to the top).


<span id="v6_7_3"><sup><small>6:7:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_7_3_11"><sup><small>6:7:3:11.</small></sup></span>  He then holds it (the fire in the pan) up thus (towards north-east). Now the gods at that time were desiring, ‘May we be like Par<i>g</i>anya (the rain-god)!’ By that body (of his [^528]) they became like Par<i>g</i>anya, and in like manner does the Sacrificer by that body (of his) become like Par<i>g</i>anya.

<span id="v6_7_3_22"><sup><small>6:7:3:22.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 6; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 45, 4\] ‘Agni roared like the thundering sky,’—for he (Agni) indeed roars like the thundering Par<i>g</i>anya;—‘again and again licking the ground, stroking [^529] the plants,’—for Par<i>g</i>anya, whilst licking again and <span id="p278"><sup><small>[ p. 278 ]</small></sup></span> again the ground, does stroke the plants;—‘scarce born, the kindled shone forth,’—for scarce born he indeed lights up everything here;—‘with his light he shineth between the two worlds,’—the two worlds, doubtless, are the heaven and the earth, and these two he indeed illumes by his light. He holds it (the fire in the pan) up so as to be beyond the reach of his arms, for Par<i>g</i>anya is beyond the reach of (our) arms.

<span id="v6_7_3_33"><sup><small>6:7:3:33.</small></sup></span>  He then lowers it; for whatever sap, whatever sustenance there is in this world, that rises upwards with it through these worlds, for Agni is the sap, Agni is the substance in this world: thus were that always to be so [^530], then there would be no sap, no sustenance in this world; but when he lowers (the fire), he bestows sap and sustenance on this world.

<span id="v6_7_3_44"><sup><small>6:7:3:44.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he lowers it,—he then indeed rises upwards from here through these worlds: that is, as it were, a rising away from here. But this earth is the resting-place; and were that always to be so, the Sacrificer would be removed from this world. But when he lowers (the fire), he thereby comes back to this resting-place, and stands firmly on this resting-place.

<span id="v6_7_3_55"><sup><small>6:7:3:55.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he lowers it,—there, indeed, in rising upwards, he conquers these worlds from here: that is, as it were, a conquering in a forward direction. Now the conquest of him who conquers only in a forward direction is completed by others; but for him who conquers both ways there is free scope: thus, when he lowers (the fire) he conquers <span id="p279"><sup><small>[ p. 279 ]</small></sup></span> these worlds both from here upwards and from thence backwards.

<span id="v6_7_3_66"><sup><small>6:7:3:66.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 7-10\] ‘Ever returning Agni, turn thou back unto me, with life, with vigour, with offspring, with riches; with gain, with wisdom, with wealth, with prosperity!—O Agni, Aṅgiras! may thine be a hundred courses, and a thousand returns: with increase of increase bring back what was lost by us, and bring us again riches!—Return again with sustenance, again, O Agni, with food and life, guard us again from trouble!—With wealth return, O Agni, overflow with the all-feeding stream on every side!’—that is, ‘with all this return thou to me!’ Four times he lowers (the fire further and further), for four times it rises upwards: thus as often as it rises upwards, so often he lowers it; and having lowered it (completely), he holds it above his navel: the significance of this has been explained [^531].

<span id="v6_7_3_77"><sup><small>6:7:3:77.</small></sup></span>  He then addresses him (Agni); for Agni is vital power: he thus lays vital power into his self: \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 11\] ‘Hither have I brought thee,’—for they do indeed bring him hither;—‘thou hast entered,’—he then lays vital power into his self;—‘stand thou firm, never staggering!’—he thus lays the vital power firmly into his self;—‘may all the people long for thee!’—the people are food: thus, ‘may all food long for thee!’—‘may thy rule not fall away from thee!’—rule means glory: thus, ‘may thy glory not fall away from thee!’

<span id="v6_7_3_88"><sup><small>6:7:3:88.</small></sup></span>  He then unties the sling of the netting, and the sling of the gold plate; for the sling belongs to <span id="p280"><sup><small>[ p. 280 ]</small></sup></span> Varu<i>n</i>a: he thus frees himself from Varu<i>n</i>a's noose. He does so with a verse to Varu<i>n</i>a: he thus frees himself from Varu<i>n</i>a's noose by its own self, by its own deity. \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 12; <i>Ri</i>k S. I, 24, 15\] ‘Take off from us, O Varu<i>n</i>a, the uppermost cord, down (take) the lowest, away the middle one!’—as the text, so the meaning;—‘and so, O Âditya, may we be sinless in thy service for safety (Aditi)!’—Aditi is this earth: thus, ‘Sinless may we belong to thee and to her (the earth)!’

<span id="v6_7_3_99"><sup><small>6:7:3:99.</small></sup></span>  He then holds him (Agni) up thus (towards south-east); for on that former occasion he raises him upwards from here towards the east with the fashioning formula [^532]; and he then holds him up thus (towards north-east [^533]). Now were that alone to take place, he (the sun), surely, would stop even there (in the north); but inasmuch as he now holds him up thus (towards south-east), he (the sun) having gone thus (in a northerly direction), then comes back again thus (in a southerly direction).

<span id="v6_7_3_1010"><sup><small>6:7:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 13; <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 1, 1\] ‘The great hath stood up erect before the Dawns,’—for before the dawn the great one (Agni) indeed stands up erect;—‘emerged from the gloom he hath come with light,’—for emerged from the gloom, the night, he indeed comes with light, with the day;—‘well-shapen with white light,’—for he, Agni, is indeed well-shapen with white light;'—‘when born, he hath filled all homesteads;’—all homesteads, doubtless, means these worlds, and these he indeed fills, when born. He holds him up so as to be beyond the reach of the arms, for he (the <span id="p281"><sup><small>[ p. 281 ]</small></sup></span> sun) is beyond the reach of arms from here. He then lowers him: he thereby comes back to this resting-place, and stands firmly on this resting-place. \[He does so\] with a <i>g</i>agatî verse [^534], for the <i>G</i>agatî gains these worlds from above hitherwards.

<span id="v6_7_3_1111"><sup><small>6:7:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 14; <i>Ri</i>k S. IV, 40, 5\] ‘The swan dwelling in the light,’—the swan dwelling in the light, doubtless, is yonder sun;—‘the Vasu dwelling in the air,’—the Vasu dwelling in the air, doubtless, is the wind;—‘the priest seated on the altar,’—the priest seated on the altar, doubtless, is Agni;—‘the guest,’—for he (Agni) is indeed the guest of all beings;—‘dwelling in the retreat [^535],’—that is, ‘dwelling in rugged places;’—‘the man-dwelling,’—the man-dwelling, doubtless, is the vital air; and men are human beings: he thus means that vital air, that fire, which (burns) in human beings;—‘the space-dwelling,’—for he (Agni) indeed is seated in all spaces;—‘the law-seated,’—that is, ‘the truth-seated;’—‘the sphere-dwelling,’—for he is indeed seated in all spheres;—‘the water-born, cow-born’—for he is indeed both water-born and cow-born;—‘law-born,’—that is, ‘truth-born;’—‘rock-born,’—for he is born from the rock;—‘the law,’—that is, ‘the truth.’ With ‘the Great!’ he deposits it (the fire); for he (Agni) is indeed the great (truth): he thus deposits him (on the seat) after making him what he is.

<span id="v6_7_3_1212"><sup><small>6:7:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  \[He does so\] with two syllables (‘b<i>ri</i>hat’),—the Sacrificer is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is <span id="p282"><sup><small>[ p. 282 ]</small></sup></span> Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus deposits him.

<span id="v6_7_3_1313"><sup><small>6:7:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then stands worshipping by him; for he makes, as it were, light of him, when he strides with him through these worlds both thus (upwards), and thus (downwards): he now makes amends to him, so that he (Agni) may not hurt him.

<span id="v6_7_3_1414"><sup><small>6:7:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he stands by him;—the gods at that time were afraid, lest he should injure these worlds of theirs from anigh: they thereby appeased him towards these worlds; and in like manner does he (the Sacrificer) now appease him towards these worlds.

<span id="v6_7_3_1515"><sup><small>6:7:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 15-17\] 'Seat thee in this thy mother's lap, thou, O Agni, knowing all ordinances! burn her not with thy heat, thy flame! shine in her with a brilliant light!—Glowing with light and heat within thine own seat, be thou gracious unto this Ukhâ, O knower of beings!—Being gracious unto me, O Agni, now seat thee graciously! seat thee here in thine own seat, having made happy all the regions!'—by saying ‘Gracious—Gracious,’ he appeases him, so that he may not injure any one, and thus he, being appeased, does not injure these worlds.

<span id="v6_7_3_1616"><sup><small>6:7:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  With three (verses) he stands by worshipping;—three in number are these worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thereby makes amends to him, and with so much does he thereby appease him towards these worlds.

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_7_4_11"><sup><small>6:7:4:11.</small></sup></span>  He then stands by him worshipping with the Vâtsapra rite [^536], For Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having by means of the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides produced creatures, created vital power for them by means of the Vâtsapra rite; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having, by means of the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, produced creatures (or, subjects), creates vital power for them by means of the Vâtsapra rite.

<span id="v6_7_4_22"><sup><small>6:7:4:22.</small></sup></span>  Now the Vâtsapra rite, doubtless, is he, the golden-handed [^537] (Agni);—hence whomsoever that is born one may wish to obtain the full (measure of) life, let him touch that one with the Vâtsapra rite, and he thereby creates vital power for that newborn one; and accordingly that one obtains the full (measure of) life. And whomsoever one may wish to be vigorous, let him first address that one with the Vik<i>ri</i>ti (fashioning) formula [^538], and that one accordingly becomes vigorous.

<span id="v6_7_4_33"><sup><small>6:7:4:33.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 18-20\] ‘From the sky Agni was first born;’—the sky, doubtless, is the breath, and from the breath he (Agni) was indeed first born,—‘from us the second time, the knower of beings,’—inasmuch as he, man-like, on that occasion generated him a second time [^539];—‘the <span id="p284"><sup><small>[ p. 284 ]</small></sup></span> third time in the waters,’—inasmuch as he there did generate him a third time from the waters;—‘he, the manly-minded, (kindling him) the imperishable,’—the manly-minded, doubtless, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati; and the imperishable, Agni [^540];—‘kindling him the mindful praises (<i>g</i>ar) him,’—for he who kindles him generates him, mindful.

<span id="v6_7_4_44"><sup><small>6:7:4:44.</small></sup></span>  ‘We know, O Agni, thy threefold three,’—Agni, Vâyu (wind), Âditya (sun), these are his three in three forms;—‘We know thy manifold scattered sites,’—inasmuch as he (Agni) is here distributed many ways;—‘we know thy highest name which is in secret,’—‘the youngest,’ that indeed is his highest name in secret;—‘we know that source whence thou art come;’—the source, doubtless, is the (heavenly) waters, for from the waters he first came.

<span id="v6_7_4_55"><sup><small>6:7:4:55.</small></sup></span>  ‘In the sea the manly-minded (kindled) thee, in the waters,’—the manly-minded is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: thus, ‘In the waters Pra<i>g</i>âpati (kindled) thee;’—‘the man-watcher hath kindled thee, O Agni, in the udder of the sky,’—the man-watcher, doubtless, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the udder of the sky is the waters ;—‘thee, whilst standing in the third region,’—the third region, doubtless, is the sky;—‘the buffaloes made (thee) grow in the lap of the waters ;’—the buffaloes, doubtless, are <span id="p285"><sup><small>[ p. 285 ]</small></sup></span> the vital airs: thus, ‘the vital airs made thee grow in the sky.’

<span id="v6_7_4_66"><sup><small>6:7:4:66.</small></sup></span>  These (three verses [^541]) have one and the same explanation regarding him (Agni): they are Trish<i>t</i>ubh verses relating to Agni. Inasmuch as they relate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trish<i>t</i>ubhs, and eleven (syllables), they are Indra;—but Agni consists of Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus stands worshipping by him. And Indra and Agni are all the gods, and Agni includes (or belongs to) all the deities: as great as Agni is, as <span id="p286"><sup><small>[ p. 286 ]</small></sup></span> great as is his measure, with so much he thus stands worshipping by him.

<span id="v6_7_4_77"><sup><small>6:7:4:77.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides and the Vâtsapra rite are (performed);—by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created this world, and by the Vâtsapra the fire (Agni); by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created the air, and by the Vâtsapra the wind (Vâyu); by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created the sky, and by the Vâtsapra the sun (Âditya); by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created the regions, and by the Vâtsapra the moon; by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created that which has been, and by the Vâtsapra that which shall be; by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created possession (wealth), and by the Vâtsapra hope; by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created the day, and by the Vâtsapra the night; by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created the former (bright) fortnights, and by the Vâtsapra the latter (dark) fortnights; by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created the half-months, and by the Vâtsapra the months; by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati created the seasons, and by the Vâtsapra the year: thus the reason why the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides and Vâtsapra are (performed) is that he thereby even now creates everything.

<span id="v6_7_4_88"><sup><small>6:7:4:88.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides and the Vâtsapra rite are (performed). By the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides Pra<i>g</i>âpati drove up to heaven. He saw that unyoking-place, the Vâtsapra, and unyoked thereat to prevent chafing; for when the yoked (beast) is not unloosed, it is chafed. In like manner the Sacrificer drives up to heaven by the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides; and unyokes by means of the Vâtsapra.

<span id="v6_7_4_99"><sup><small>6:7:4:99.</small></sup></span>  Having stridden the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, he then <span id="p287"><sup><small>[ p. 287 ]</small></sup></span> forthwith stands by the fire worshipping it with the Vâtsapra, just as one who has journeyed would forthwith unyoke. Men (proceed) after the manner of the gods: hence even now, when a troop of men have journeyed they forthwith unyoke.

<span id="v6_7_4_1010"><sup><small>6:7:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  Now, the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides indeed are the day and the night, and the Vâtsapra is the day and the night: he thus journeys for a day and a night, and takes rest for a day and a night: and hence even now when a troop of men have journeyed for a day and a night they take rest for a day and a night.

<span id="v6_7_4_1111"><sup><small>6:7:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  Only for one half of the year he strides the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, and for one half he worships the fire with the Vâtsapra; for the world of heaven is in the midst of the year: thus were he to stride for less than half (a year), he would not reach that world of heaven; and were he to do so for more than half (a year), he would pass beyond that world of heaven and lose it; but when he strides for one half, and worships the fire for one half, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.

<span id="v6_7_4_1212"><sup><small>6:7:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  He proceeds with these two alternately [^542], even as one would accomplish a long way by (repeatedly) unyoking. Both before and after (the Dîkshâ), he combines both, the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides and the Vâtsapra; for the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides are the day, and the Vâtsapra the night; and Pra<i>g</i>âpati, both when he was about to generate and when he had generated this universe, enclosed it on both sides by day and night: in like <span id="p288"><sup><small>[ p. 288 ]</small></sup></span> manner the Sacrificer now, both when he is about to generate and when he has generated this universe, encloses it on both sides by day and night.

<span id="v6_7_4_1313"><sup><small>6:7:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘If the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides are the day, and the Vâtsapra the night, and both of them are (performed) during the day, not during the night, how then are they both performed for (or by) him also during the night?’ Well, on that (first) occasion, when he is being initiated, he, at the outset, combines both (performances) in the afternoon; for the afternoon is the same thing as the night. Then throwing them thus together, he at the end combines them both in the forenoon; for the forenoon is the same thing as the day; and in this way they are both performed during the day, and both during the night.

<span id="v6_7_4_1414"><sup><small>6:7:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  Now early on the day on which he may intend to combine them, when the sun has risen, he first throws out the ashes (from the pan); having thrown out the ashes, he releases his speech; having released his speech, he puts on a kindling-stick; having put on a kindling-stick, he takes the ashes down to (and throws them into) the water. In the same way as he takes them down he returns after taking some of the ashes; and having thrown it into the pan he stands reverentially by the fire. He then performs two expiations.

<span id="v6_7_4_1515"><sup><small>6:7:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  And if the day should be one for the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, let him, after striding the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, worship the fire with the Vâtsapra; and if it be one for the Vâtsapra, let him, after worshipping with the Vâtsapra, and striding the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, finally perform the Vâtsapra. Let him not conclude by performing the Vish<i>n</i>u-strides, for that would be as if <span id="p289"><sup><small>[ p. 289 ]</small></sup></span> after going for a drive he were not to unyoke; but when he concludes by performing the Vâtsapra—the Vâtsapra being a halting-place—(it is) as if he made a halt and unloosed (the team): let him therefore conclude by performing the Vâtsapra.

## Footnotes

[^505]: 265:1 That is, the Ukhya Agni, or fire in the pan, which the Sacrificer will have to carry about during his time of initiation; and which, moreover, is here taken to, be the Sacrificer's divine body ([VI, 6, 4. 5](Book_3_6_6#v6_6_4_5)).

[^506]: 265:2 See I, 3, 5, 12,—twelve months of the year, five seasons, and three worlds: this makes twenty; and he that burns yonder is the twenty-first. See also Ait. Br. IV, is, where the sun is identified with the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a or Vishuvat day, the central day of the year, by which the gods raised the sun up to the heavens.

[^507]: 268:1 That is, the boards forming the seat itself; and being a cubit long.

[^508]: 268:2 Lit. ‘from (the fire in the pan) burning over (or through the clay);’ or ‘from (their) being burnt over.’

[^509]: 268:3 Apparently a round netted mat, on which the fire-pan is to be placed, and which is fastened to a cord by means of six strings, thus somewhat resembling the scale of a balance.

[^510]: 269:1 Or, the central point, the hinge or hook, to which the worlds are attached.

[^511]: 269:2 Lit. carries that form by that form,—that is to say, he sustains, by means of the sun, the whole world in the form of Agni.

[^512]: 269:3 That is to say, he who desires to derive the full benefit from the initiation ceremony, and the Agni<i>k</i>ayana generally, must not only keep up the Ukhya Agni (or pan-fire) during the year of the initiation, but must also carry him at least for a time every day during that period.

[^513]: 270:1 These words, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, are merely intended as synonymous (paryâya) for ‘ukhâ,’ or fire-pan, not as different vessels (such as the pot used temporarily when the pan is broken) as one might suppose.

[^514]: 271:1 That is, of the pan containing the fire.

[^515]: 271:2 Sâya<i>n</i>a (on [VII, 2, 1, 15](Book_3_7_2#v7_2_1_15)) explains them as two balls of straw. The comparison in [26](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_1_26) rather points to their being round mats.

[^516]: 271:3 Thus Sâya<i>n</i>a. If, on the other hand, Agni be intended here, this might be taken as an illusion to the regular worship of the fire at the morning and evening twilights (cf. [VI, 7, 2, 3](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_2_3)).

[^517]: 272:1 The author now proceeds to give further particulars regarding the ceremonial details treated of in the preceding chapter ([VI, 7, 1, 1](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_1_1) seq.).

[^518]: 272:2 Literally, ‘seen’ or appearing (like).’

[^519]: 272:3 Rather ‘irresistible, difficult to bear (against);’ but the author connects ‘durmarsha’ with ‘mar,’ to die.

[^520]: 272:4 <i>Ri</i>k S. I, 96, 5, slightly different.

[^521]: 273:1 That is to say, they are allied.

[^522]: 273:2 Or, perhaps, after the precedence (example) of the Dawn.

[^523]: 274:1 The ordinary hymn-tune of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma-sâman, the last and characteristic stotra of the simplest, or Agnish<i>t</i>oma Soma-sacrifice.

[^524]: 274:2 Or, the bird (or eagle, supar<i>n</i>a) Garutmat.

[^525]: 275:1 Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to make this a round vessel,—dro<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> parima<i>n</i><i>d</i>alanâma-(? lamâna)rûpa<i>m</i> dro<i>n</i>am iva <i>k</i>îyate drona<i>k</i>it.

[^526]: 275:2 Samuhya samuhya purîsha<i>m</i> tenaiva kevalena <i>k</i>iyata iti samuhyapurîsha<i>h</i>, Sây.

[^527]: 275:3 As in the case of the lump of clay, [VI, 4, 3, 10](Book_3_6_4#v6_4_3_10).

[^528]: 275:4 [VI, 7, 1, 8](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_1_8) seq.

[^529]: 275:5 Or the Vish<i>n</i>u-steps, as the term, for a special reason, was translated at [V, 4, 2, 6](Book_3_5_4#v5_4_2_6).

[^530]: 277:1 Viz. by the Agni who is now being held up, and of whom Par<i>g</i>anya is said to be another form, at [VI, 1, 3, 15](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_3_15). It is probably the smoke rising from the fire-pan that suggests the idea of the Jupiter pluvius sending forth his flashes of light from the dark cloud.

[^531]: 277:2 Literally, anointing (? either furbishing, or impregnating).

[^532]: 278:1 Literally, were that to be so much only (i.e. were the fire always to be held up there).

[^533]: 279:1 [VI, 7, 1, 8](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_1_8) seq.

[^534]: 280:1 [VI, 7, 2, 9](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_2_9).

[^535]: 280:2 [VI, 7, 3, 1](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_3_1).

[^536]: 281:1 It is rather a trish<i>t</i>ubh verse.

[^537]: 281:2 Rather, (the guest) dwelling in the house (duro<i>n</i>a-sad), but the author evidently derives ‘duro<i>n</i>a’ from ‘dus’ (bad), making it a synonym of ‘durga.’

[^538]: 283:1 That is, the recitation of Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XII, 18-28 or 29 (<i>Ri</i>k S. X, 45), ascribed to the poet Vatsaprî Bhâlandana. The Brâhma<i>n</i>a, however, comments only on the first three verses, and perhaps these alone were used for the purpose at the time when the Brâhma<i>n</i>a was composed.

[^539]: 283:2 This is a somewhat doubtful meaning of ‘dâkshâya<i>n</i>a-hasta.’ The synonyms (if correct), hira<i>n</i>yapâ<i>n</i>i and hira<i>n</i>yahasta, always refer to Savit<i>ri</i>, the sun.

[^540]: 283:3 See [VI, 7, 2, 5](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_2_5)\-[6](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_2_6).

[^541]: 283:4 ? Or, as a second; see above, [VI, 1, 1, 11](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_11).

[^542]: 284:1 The construction of the text here favoured by the author is very doubtful. It has probably to be construed,—‘the third time (he, Agni, was born) in the waters, he, the manly-minded (or, friendly to men). Kindling him, the imperishable (Agni), the heedful (? or pious) one praises him,’—or perhaps, ‘While kindling him, the considerate one praises him unceasingly.’ A point which favours the author's construction is that, in verse 3, ‘n<i>ri</i>ma<i>n</i>aas’ certainly refers not to Agni, but to him who generated him.

[^543]: 285:1 The remaining verses (XII, 21-29) are as follows:—
  1\. Agni roared like the thundering sky, &c. (see VI, 7, 3, 2).
  2\. The upraiser of glories, the upholder of riches, the inspirer of thoughts, the guardian of Soma; the excellent son of power, shines forth as king in the waters, kindled before the dawns.
  3\. A beacon unto all that is, the child of the world filled the two spheres even when born; even the hard rock he broke going thither when the five peoples worshipped Agni.
  4\. An eager cleanser, a wise messenger, the immortal Agni has been set up among the mortals; flickering (?) he sends forth the red smoke, striving with his bright flame to reach the sky.
  5\. Looking like a golden disk, &c. (see [VI, 7, 2](Book_3_6_7#v6_7_2)).
  6\. Whoso maketh for thee this day a ghee-baked cake, O divine Agni of auspicious flame, lead him onwards to bliss, unto god-allotted glory, O youngest!
  7\. Make him share in the songs of triumph, make him share in every hymn that is sung! Dear be he unto Sûrya, dear unto Agni; let him prevail with the living one and with them that are to be born!
  8\. They that worship thee day by day, O Agni, win all desirable boons; ardently wishing for wealth, they have opened with thee the stable filled with cows!
