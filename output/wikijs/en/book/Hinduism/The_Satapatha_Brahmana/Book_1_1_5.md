## FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v1_5_1_11"><sup><small>1:5:1:11.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu) now utters his call for the Pravara (choosing of the Hot<i>ri</i>) [^329]. The reason why he utters his call, is that the (Adhvaryu's) call is <span id="p132">[<sup><small>p. 132</small></sup>]</span> the sacrifice: ‘having bespoke the sacrifice, I will choose the Hot<i>ri</i>,’ thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he utters his call for the Pravara.

<span id="v1_5_1_22"><sup><small>1:5:1:22.</small></sup></span>  He utters his call after taking the fuel-band; for if the Adhvaryu were to utter his call without taking hold of the sacrifice, he would either be unsteady or meet with some other ailment.

<span id="v1_5_1_33"><sup><small>1:5:1:33.</small></sup></span>  Here now some utter the call after taking sacrificial grass (barhis) from the covered altar, or they utter the call after cutting off and taking a chip of fire-wood, arguing, ‘this, surely, is something belonging to the sacrifice; after taking hold of this, the sacrifice, we will utter the call.’ Let him, however, not do this; for that also wherewith the firewood was tied together and wherewith they sweep the fire [^330] is, doubtless, something belonging to the sacrifice; and thus indeed he utters his call after taking hold of the sacrifice: for this reason let him utter the call after taking the fuel-band.

<span id="v1_5_1_44"><sup><small>1:5:1:44.</small></sup></span>  Having uttered the call, he in the first place chooses him who is the Hot<i>ri</i> of the gods, that is, Agni. Thereby he propitiates both Agni and the gods: for by first choosing Agni, he propitiates Agni; <span id="p133">[<sup><small>p. 133</small></sup>]</span> and by first choosing him who is the Hot<i>ri</i> of the gods, he propitiates the gods.

<span id="v1_5_1_55"><sup><small>1:5:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He says, ‘Agni, the god, the divine Hot<i>ri</i>\—,’ for Agni is indeed the Hot<i>ri</i> of the gods, therefore he says ‘Agni, the god, the divine Hot<i>ri</i>:’ thereby he propitiates both Agni and the gods; for by his first mentioning Agni he propitiates Agni; and by his first mentioning him who is the Hot<i>ri</i> of the gods, he propitiates the gods.

<span id="v1_5_1_66"><sup><small>1:5:1:66.</small></sup></span>  ‘May he worship, knowing the gods [^331], he the thoughtful one,’—for he, Agni, indeed, knows the gods well: hence, he thereby says 'may he who knows them well worship (them) in due form!

<span id="v1_5_1_77"><sup><small>1:5:1:77.</small></sup></span>  ‘Like as Manu (did), like as Bharata;’—Manu, indeed, worshipped with sacrifice in olden times, and doing as he did these descendants of his now sacrifice: therefore he says ‘like as Manu.’ Or, say they, (it means) ‘at the sacrifice of Manu,’ and therefore he says ‘as (he did) with Manu.’

<span id="v1_5_1_88"><sup><small>1:5:1:88.</small></sup></span>  ‘Like as (with) Bharata,’—for, say they, he bears (bhar) the oblation to the gods, hence Bharata (the bearer) is Agni; or, say they, he, having become the breath, supports (bhar) these creatures, and therefore he says ‘like as Bharata.’

<span id="v1_5_1_99"><sup><small>1:5:1:99.</small></sup></span>  He then chooses (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot<i>ri</i>). He thus introduces him both to the (ancestral) <i>ri</i>shis and to the gods (as if he were saying), ‘he is of mighty strength who obtained the sacrifice!’ for this reason he chooses (him as) the ancestral one.

<span id="v1_5_1_1010"><sup><small>1:5:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  He chooses from the remote end (of the sacrificer's ancestral line) [^332] downwards; for it is from the <span id="p134">[<sup><small>p. 134</small></sup>]</span> remote end downwards that a race is propagated. Thereby he also propitiates the lord of seniority; for here among men the father comes first, then the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he chooses from the remote end downwards.

<span id="v1_5_1_1111"><sup><small>1:5:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  Having named the ancestral, he says, ‘Like as, Brahman;’—for Agni is the Brahman (the Veda, or the sacerdotium), and therefore he says ‘like as Brahman;’—‘may he bring (the gods) hither!’ what deities he bids him bring hither, those he refers to in saying ‘may he bring (them) hither.’

<span id="v1_5_1_1212"><sup><small>1:5:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  ‘The Brâhma<i>n</i>as (priests) are the guardians of this sacrifice;’ for guardians of the sacrifice, indeed, are those Brâhma<i>n</i>as who are versed in the sacred writ, because they spread it, they originate it: these he thereby propitiates; and for this reason he says, ‘the Brâhma<i>n</i>as are the guardians of the sacrifice.’

<span id="v1_5_1_1313"><sup><small>1:5:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  ‘N.N. is the man,’ thereby he chooses this man for his Hot<i>ri</i>; heretofore he was not a Hot<i>ri</i>, but now he is a Hot<i>ri</i>.

<span id="v1_5_1_1414"><sup><small>1:5:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  The chosen Hot<i>ri</i> mutters,—has recourse to the deities: in order that he may give the vasha<i>t</i>\-call to the gods in its proper order, that he may convey the oblation to the gods in its proper order, that he may not stumble, he has thus recourse to the deities.

<span id="v1_5_1_1515"><sup><small>1:5:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  He mutters on this occasion [^333], ‘Thee, O divine Savit<i>ri</i>, they now choose,’—thereby he has recourse to Savit<i>ri</i> for his impulsion (prasava), for Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller (prasavit<i>ri</i>) of the gods;—‘(thee who art) Agni, for the Hot<i>ri</i>ship,’ thereby he <span id="p135">[<sup><small>p. 135</small></sup>]</span> propitiates both Agni and the gods; for by first naming Agni, he propitiates Agni; and by first naming him who is the Hot<i>ri</i> of the gods, he propitiates the gods.

<span id="v1_5_1_1616"><sup><small>1:5:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  ‘Together with father Vai<i>s</i>vânara,’—for the father Vai<i>s</i>vânara (‘common to all men’), doubtless, is the year, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati (lord of creatures); hence he thereby propitiates the year and thus Pra<i>g</i>âpati.—‘O Agni! O Pûshan! O B<i>ri</i>haspati! speak forth and offer up sacrifice (pra-ya<i>g</i>)!’—he (the Hot<i>ri</i>), namely, will have to recite the anuvâkyâs and the yâgyâs [^334]; he therefore now propitiates those gods: do ye recite, ‘do ye offer!’ thus (he thereby says).

<span id="v1_5_1_1717"><sup><small>1:5:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  ‘May we partake of the bounty of the Vasus, of the wide sway of the Rudras! may we be beloved of the Âdityas for the sake of (aditi) security from injury, free from obstruction!’—these, to wit, the Vasus, Rudras, and Âdityas, namely, are three (classes of) gods: ‘may we enjoy their protection’ he thereby says.

<span id="v1_5_1_1818"><sup><small>1:5:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  ‘May I this day utter speech that is agreeable to the gods;’—by this he means to say ‘may I this day recite what is agreeable to the gods,’ for auspicious it is when one recites what is agreeable to the gods.

<span id="v1_5_1_1919"><sup><small>1:5:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  ‘Agreeable to the Brahmans,’—by this he means to say ‘may I this day recite what is agreeable to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as (priests);’ for auspicious it is when one recites what is agreeable to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. <span id="p136">[<sup><small>p. 136</small></sup>]</span> 1:5:1:2020\. ‘Agreeable to Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa [^335],’—man (nara), namely, is a creature: hence he says this for all the creatures; thereby it is auspicious, and whether or not he knows (forms of speech that are agreeable), they are uttered (and received with applause), ‘well he has recited! well he has recited!’—‘What at the Hot<i>ri</i> choice may escape the crooked eye this day, that may Agni bring back here, he, the knower of beings (<i>g</i>âtavedas), the nimble one (vi<i>k</i>arsha<i>n</i>i)!’—by this he means to say, ‘even as those (three) Agnis, whom they first chose for the Hot<i>ri</i>ship, passed away [^336], (but thou, the fourth Agni, wast then obtained,) so do thou make good for me whatever mistake may have been committed at my election!’ and it is accordingly made good for him.

<span id="v1_5_1_2121"><sup><small>1:5:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  He now touches the Adhvaryu and the Âgnîdhra: for the Adhvaryu is the mind, and the Hot<i>ri</i> is, speech: thus he thereby brings mind and speech together.

<span id="v1_5_1_2222"><sup><small>1:5:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  At the same time he mutters [^337], ‘From anguish may the six spaces protect me, fire, earth, water, wind, day, and night [^338]!’—‘may these deities protect <span id="p137">[<sup><small>p. 137</small></sup>]</span> me from disease!’ thus he thereby says; for he whom these deities protect from disease, will not stumble (or fail).

<span id="v1_5_1_2323"><sup><small>1:5:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  He steps beside the Hot<i>ri</i>'s seat, takes one stalk of (reed) grass from the Hot<i>ri</i>'s seat and casts it outside (the sacrificial ground), with the formula, ‘Ejected is the wealth-clutcher (parâvasu, lit. “off-wealth”)!’ Formerly, namely, the Hot<i>ri</i> of the Asuras was one Parâvasu by name: him he thereby ejects from the Hot<i>ri</i>'s seat.

<span id="v1_5_1_2424"><sup><small>1:5:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  He then sits down on the Hot<i>ri</i>'s seat, with the formula, ‘I here sit down on the seat of the wealth-bestower (arvâvasu, lit. “hither-wealth”)!’ for one Arvâvasu by name was the Hot<i>ri</i> of the gods [^339], and on his seat he accordingly sits down.

<span id="v1_5_1_2525"><sup><small>1:5:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  At the same time he mutters, ‘O All-maker, thou art the protector of lives! do not ye two (fires) scorch me away (from this) [^340], injure me not! this <span id="p138">[<sup><small>p. 138</small></sup>]</span> is your sphere;’ with this he moves slightly northwards: by this (mantra, he indicates that) he sits midway between the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya, and thus he propitiates these two; and in accordance with what he says, ‘do not scorch me away from this! injure me not!’ they do not injure him.

<span id="v1_5_1_2626"><sup><small>1:5:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  He then mutters whilst looking at the (Âhavanîya) fire, ‘All ye gods, instruct me, how and what I am to mind while seated here as the chosen Hot<i>ri</i>! declare my share (of the sacrificial duties), how and by what road I am to convey the oblation to you!’—for as one says to those for whom food has been cooked, ‘order me how I am to bring if you, how I am to serve it up for you!’ in like manner he is desirous of directions regarding the gods, and for this reason he mutters thus, ‘instruct me how I may utter the Vasha<i>t</i>\-call for you in its proper order, how I may bring you the oblation in its proper order!’


<span id="v1_5_2"><sup><small>1:5:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

### THE FORE-OFFERINGS (PRAYÂ<i>G</i>AS).

<span id="v1_5_2_11"><sup><small>1:5:2:11.</small></sup></span>  \[The Hot<i>ri</i> continues\], 'May Agni, the priest (hot<i>ri</i>), know (undertake) Agni's priestly duty (hautram),'—thereby he says ‘may Agni, as Hot<i>ri</i>, know this!’ 'Agni's priestly duty' he says, because it is his duty that he must know;—‘that means of salvation [^341],’—the means of salvation, assuredly, is the sacrifice: ‘may he know the sacrifice’ is what he thereby says.—‘Favourable to thee, O Sacrificer, is <span id="p139">[<sup><small>p. 139</small></sup>]</span> the deity!’ by this he says ‘favourable is the deity to thee, O Sacrificer, whose Hot<i>ri</i> is Agni [^342]!’—‘Take up [^343] the spoon, O Adhvaryu, full of butter!’ thereby he urges on the Adhvaryu. The reason why he mentions one (spoon) only (is this).

<span id="v1_5_2_22"><sup><small>1:5:2:22.</small></sup></span>  The Sacrificer, doubtless, stands behind the <i>g</i>uhû, and he, who means evil to him, stands behind the upabh<i>ri</i>t; and if he were to speak of two (spoons), he would cause the spiteful enemy to countervail the Sacrificer. Behind the <i>g</i>uhû stands the eater, and behind the upabh<i>ri</i>t the one to be eaten; and if he were to speak of two (spoons), he would make the one to be eaten countervail the eater. For these reasons he speaks of one (spoon) only.

<span id="v1_5_2_33"><sup><small>1:5:2:33.</small></sup></span>  \[He continues\],‘—(the spoon which is) devoted to the gods, possessed of all boons,’ he praises, he magnifies it when he says ‘devoted to the gods, possessed of all boons.’—‘Let us praise the gods, the praiseworthy! let us adore the adorable! let us worship the worshipful!’ that is, ‘let us praise those gods who are praiseworthy! let us adore those who are adorable! let us worship those who are worthy of worship!’ the praiseworthy, to wit, are the men, the adorable the fathers, and the worshipful the gods.

<span id="v1_5_2_44"><sup><small>1:5:2:44.</small></sup></span>  For, indeed, the creatures that are not allowed to take part in the sacrifice are forlorn; and therefore <span id="p140">[<sup><small>p. 140</small></sup>]</span> he makes those creatures here on earth that are not forlorn, take part in the sacrifice: behind the men are the beasts, and behind the gods are the birds, the plants, and the trees; and thus all that here exists is made to take part in the sacrifice.

<span id="v1_5_2_55"><sup><small>1:5:2:55.</small></sup></span>  These same (preceding formulas) are nine utterances; for nine, in number, are those breaths (or vital airs) in man [^344], and these he thereby puts into him (the sacrificer): for this reason there are nine utterances.

<span id="v1_5_2_66"><sup><small>1:5:2:66.</small></sup></span>  The sacrifice fled away from the gods. The gods called out after it, ‘Listen (a-<i>s</i>ru) to us [^345]! come back to us!’ It replied, ‘So be it!’ and returned to the gods; and with what had thus returned to them, the gods worshipped; and by worshipping with it they became the gods they now are.

<span id="v1_5_2_77"><sup><small>1:5:2:77.</small></sup></span>  Now when he (the Adhvaryu) calls (on the Âgnîdhra), he thereby calls after the sacrifice, ‘Listen to us! come back to us!’ and when he (the Âgnîdhra) responds, then the sacrifice comes back, saying ‘so be it!’ and with it, thus passing over to them, as with seed [^346], the priests carry on the tradition, imperceptibly to the sacrificer; for even as people hand on from one to the other a full vessel [^347], in <span id="p141">[<sup><small>p. 141</small></sup>]</span> the same way they (the priests) hand down that (sacrifice) from one to the other. They hand it down by means of speech, for the sacrifice is speech (prayer), and speech is seed: therefore they keep up the tradition by means of it.

<span id="v1_5_2_88"><sup><small>1:5:2:88.</small></sup></span>  After he has said (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Recite!’ the Adhvaryu must utter nothing improper (worldly); neither must the Hot<i>ri</i> utter anything improper. The Adhvaryu [^348] utters his call: thereby the sacrifice passes on to the Âgnîdhra.

<span id="v1_5_2_99"><sup><small>1:5:2:99.</small></sup></span>  The Âgnîdhra must utter nothing improper until his response. The Âgnîdhra responds: thereby the sacrifice passes back to the Adhvaryu.

<span id="v1_5_2_1010"><sup><small>1:5:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  The Adhvaryu must utter nothing improper until he pronounces (the word) ‘ya<i>g</i>a (recite the offering-prayer):’ in saying ‘ya<i>g</i>a’ the Adhvaryu hands the sacrifice on to the Hot<i>ri</i>.

<span id="v1_5_2_1111"><sup><small>1:5:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  The Hot<i>ri</i> must utter nothing improper until his vasha<i>t</i>\-call. By the vasha<i>t</i>\-call he pours it (the sacrifice) into the fire, as seed into the womb; for the fire is indeed the womb of the sacrifice, from thence it is brought forth. So now at the havis-sacrifice. And at the Soma-cult,—

<span id="v1_5_2_1212"><sup><small>1:5:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  When he has drawn (the Soma), the Adhvaryu must not utter anything improper until his summons <span id="p142">[<sup><small>p. 142</small></sup>]</span> (for the chanting of the stotra [^349]): with the call ‘draw near!’ the Adhvaryu hands the sacrifice on to the Udgât<i>ri</i>s (chanters).

<span id="v1_5_2_1313"><sup><small>1:5:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  The Udgât<i>ri</i>s must not utter anything improper until the last (stotra-verse): ‘this is the last one,’ thus thinking, the Udgât<i>ri</i>s hand on the sacrifice to the Hot<i>ri</i>.

<span id="v1_5_2_1414"><sup><small>1:5:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  The Hot<i>ri</i> must utter nothing improper until the vasha<i>t</i>\-call. With the vasha<i>t</i>\-call he pours it (the sacrifice) into the fire, as seed into the womb; for the fire is indeed the womb of the sacrifice, since from thence it is brought forth.

<span id="v1_5_2_1515"><sup><small>1:5:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  If he whom the sacrifice approaches were to utter anything improper, he would waste the sacrifice, even as he might waste (water by spilling from) a full vessel. And where the officiating priests thus practice sacrifice with a perfect mutual understanding between them, there everything works regularly and no hitch occurs: therefore it is in this way that the sacrifice must be nursed.

<span id="v1_5_2_1616"><sup><small>1:5:2:1616.</small></sup></span>  Now there are here five utterances, viz. (1) ‘Bid (him, Agni, or them) hear!’ (2) ‘Yea, may he (or, one) hear!’ (3) ‘Pronounce the prayer to the kindling-sticks!’ (4) ‘We who pronounce the prayer . . .’ (5) ‘May he bear (the sacrifice to the gods) [^350]!’ fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, five are the seasons of the year: this is the one measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation. <span id="p143">[<sup><small>p. 143</small></sup>]</span> 1:5:2:1717\. These (five formulas) consist of seventeen syllables;—seventeenfold, indeed, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the sacrifice: this is the one measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation.

<span id="v1_5_2_1818"><sup><small>1:5:2:1818.</small></sup></span>  With ‘O <i>s</i>râvaya [^351]!’ the gods sent forth the east wind; with ‘Astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i> [^351]!’ they caused the clouds to flow together; with ‘Ya<i>g</i>a (pronounce the yâ<i>g</i>yâ)!’ (they sent forth) the lightning; with' Ye ya<i>g</i>âmahe (we who pray),' the thunder; with the vasha<i>t</i>\-call they caused it to rain [^352].

<span id="v1_5_2_1919"><sup><small>1:5:2:1919.</small></sup></span>  Should he (the sacrificer) be desirous of rain, or should he perform a special offering [^353], or even at the new- and full-moon sacrifice itself, he may say, ‘Verily, I am desirous of rain!’—and he may also say to the Adhvaryu, ‘Ponder thou in thy mind the east wind and the lightning!’—to the Âgnîdhra, ‘Ponder thou the clouds in thy mind!’—to the Hot<i>ri</i>, ‘Ponder thou in thy mind the thunder and rain!’—to the Brahman, ‘Ponder thou all, these in thy mind!’—for where the officiating priests thus practice sacrifice with a perfect mutual understanding between them, there it will indeed rain.

<span id="v1_5_2_2020"><sup><small>1:5:2:2020.</small></sup></span>  With ‘O <i>s</i>râvaya!’ the gods called the shining one (virâ<i>g</i>, viz. cow), with ‘Astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>!’ they untied the calf and let it go to her; with ‘Ya<i>g</i>a!’ they raised (its head to the udder of the cow) [^354]; with <span id="p144">[<sup><small>p. 144</small></sup>]</span> ‘Ye ya<i>g</i>âmahe!’ they sat down by her (for milking); with the vasha<i>t</i>\-call they milked her. The shining one, doubtless, is this (earth), and of her this is the milking: and for him who knows this to be the milking of the shining one, this shining (earth-cow) thus milks out all his desires.


<span id="v1_5_3"><sup><small>1:5:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v1_5_3_11"><sup><small>1:5:3:11.</small></sup></span>  The fore-offerings (prayâ<i>g</i>a), assuredly, are the seasons: hence there are five of them, for there are five seasons.

<span id="v1_5_3_22"><sup><small>1:5:3:22.</small></sup></span>  The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprang from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, were once contending for this sacrifice, (which is) their father Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the year: ‘Ours it (he) shall be!’ ‘Ours it (he) shall be!’ they said.

<span id="v1_5_3_33"><sup><small>1:5:3:33.</small></sup></span>  Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw these fore-offerings and worshipped with them. By means of them they gained (pra-<i>g</i>i) the seasons, the year; they deprived their rivals of the seasons, of the year: hence (the fore-offerings are) victories (pra<i>g</i>aya), for, assuredly, pra<i>g</i>aya is the very same term as prayâ<i>g</i>a (fore-offering) [^355]. And in the same way this one (the sacrificer) wins by means of them the seasons, the year; deprives his rivals of the seasons, of the year. This is the reason why he performs the fore-offerings.

<span id="v1_5_3_44"><sup><small>1:5:3:44.</small></sup></span>  The sacrificial food at these offerings consists of <span id="p145">[<sup><small>p. 145</small></sup>]</span> clarified butter. Now the butter, indeed, is a thunderbolt, and with that thunderbolt, the butter, the gods gained the seasons, the year, and deprived their rivals of the seasons, of the year. And with that thunderbolt, the butter, he now, in the same way, gains the seasons, the year, and deprives his enemies of the seasons, of the year. For this reason clarified butter forms the sacrificial food at these (offerings).

<span id="v1_5_3_55"><sup><small>1:5:3:55.</small></sup></span>  Now this butter is the year's own liquor: hence the gods gained it (the year) by means of its own liquor; and in the same way he also now gains it by means of its own liquor. This is the reason why clarified butter forms the sacrificial food at these (fore-offerings).

<span id="v1_5_3_66"><sup><small>1:5:3:66.</small></sup></span>  Let him (the Adhvaryu) not move from that same spot where he may be standing when he calls for the fore-offerings. A battle, it is true, is witnessed whenever any one performs the fore-offerings, and whichever of the two combatants is worsted, that one, no doubt, retreats; and he who obtains the victory, advances still nearer: he (the Adhvaryu) might therefore (feel inclined to) step nearer and nearer (to the fire), and offer the oblations (while moving) nearer and nearer [^356].

<span id="v1_5_3_77"><sup><small>1:5:3:77.</small></sup></span>  This, however, he should not do; he should not move from that same spot where he may be standing when he calls for the fore-offerings. Let <span id="p146">[<sup><small>p. 146</small></sup>]</span> him rather offer the (five) oblations in that part (of the fire) where he thinks there is the fiercest blaze; for only by being offered in blazing (fire), oblations are successful.

<span id="v1_5_3_88"><sup><small>1:5:3:88.</small></sup></span>  He (the Adhvaryu), having called (on, and having been responded to by, the Âgnîdhra), says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer (yâ<i>g</i>yâ) to the Samidhs (kindling-sticks)!’ Thereby he kindles the spring; the spring, when kindled, kindles the other seasons; the seasons, when kindled, generate the creatures and ripen the plants. In the same (formula) he also implies the (four) remaining seasons, and in order to avoid sameness, he introduces the others by merely saying each time, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer!’ For were he to say, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to Tanûnapât!’ ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer to the I<i>d</i>s!’ and so on, he would commit (the fault of) repetition: hence he introduces the remaining (seasons or fore-offerings) by merely saying each time, ‘Pronounce the offering-prayer [^357]!’

<span id="v1_5_3_99"><sup><small>1:5:3:99.</small></sup></span>  He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) now pronounces the offering-prayer (yâ<i>g</i>yâ) to the Samidhs. The samidh (kindler), doubtless, is the spring. The gods, at that time, appropriated the spring, and deprived their rivals of the spring; and now this one (the <span id="p147">[<sup><small>p. 147</small></sup>]</span> sacrificer) also appropriates the spring, and deprives his rivals of the spring: this is the reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer to the Samidhs.

<span id="v1_5_3_1010"><sup><small>1:5:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  After that he pronounces the offering-prayer to Tanûnapât. Tanûnapât, doubtless, is the summer; for the summer burns the bodies (tanûn tapati) of these creatures. The gods, at that time, appropriated the summer, and deprived their rivals of the summer; and now this one also appropriates the summer, and deprives his rivals of the summer: this is the reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer to Tanûnapât.

<span id="v1_5_3_1111"><sup><small>1:5:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the I<i>d</i>s. The I<i>d</i>s (praises), doubtless, are the rains; they are the rains, inasmuch as the vile, crawling (vermin) [^358] which shrink during the summer and winter, then (in the rainy season) move about in quest of food, as it were, praising (î<i>d</i>) the rains: therefore the I<i>d</i>s are the rains. The gods, at that time, appropriated the rains, and deprived their rivals of the rains; and now this one also appropriates the rains, and deprives his rivals of the rains: this is the reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer to the I<i>d</i>s.

<span id="v1_5_3_1212"><sup><small>1:5:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Barhis (covering of sacrificial grass on the altar). The barhis, doubtless, is the autumn; the barhis is the autumn, inasmuch as these plants which shrink during the summer and winter grow by the rains, and in autumn lie spread open after the fashion of barhis: for this reason the barhis is the autumn. The gods, at that time, appropriated the autumn, and deprived their rivals of the autumn; <span id="p148">[<sup><small>p. 148</small></sup>]</span> and now this one also appropriates the autumn, and deprives his rivals of the autumn: this is why he pronounces the prayer to the barhis.

<span id="v1_5_3_1313"><sup><small>1:5:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then pronounces the offering-prayer with ‘Svâhâ! Svâhâ [^359]!’ The Svâhâ-call, namely, marks the end of the sacrifice, and the end of the year is the winter, since the winter is on the other (remoter) side of the spring. By the end (of the sacrifice) the gods, at that time, appropriated the end (of the year); by the end they deprived their rivals of the end; and by the end this one also now appropriates the end; by the end he deprives his rivals of the end: this is why he pronounces the offering-prayers with ‘Svâhâ! Svâhâ!’

<span id="v1_5_3_1414"><sup><small>1:5:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  Now the spring, assuredly, comes into life again out of the winter, for out of the one the other is born again: therefore he who knows this, is indeed born again in this world.

<span id="v1_5_3_1515"><sup><small>1:5:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  In order to avoid sameness he prays (alternately) with ‘may they accept!’ and ‘may he (or it) accept [^360]!’ for he would commit (the fault) of repetition, <span id="p149">[<sup><small>p. 149</small></sup>]</span> if he were to pray with ‘may they accept!’ each time, or with ‘may he accept!’ each time. By ‘may they accept!’ doubtless, females (are implied); and by ‘may he accept!’ a male (is implied): thereby a productive union is effected, and for this reason he prays (alternately) with ‘may they accept!’ and ‘may he (or it) accept!’

<span id="v1_5_3_1616"><sup><small>1:5:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  Now at the fourth fore-offering, to the barhis, he pours (butter) together (into the <i>g</i>uhû [^361]). The barhis, namely, represents descendants, and the butter seed: hence seed is thereby infused into the descendants, and by that infused seed descendants are generated again and again. For this reason he pours together (butter) at the fourth fore-offering, that to the barhis.

<span id="v1_5_3_1717"><sup><small>1:5:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  Now, a battle, as it were, is going on here when any one performs the fore-offerings; and whichever of the two combatants a friend (an ally) joins, he obtains the victory: hence a friend thereby joins the <i>g</i>uhû from out of the upabh<i>ri</i>t, and by him it (or he) obtains the victory. This is why he pours together (butter) at the fourth fore-offering, that to the barhis.

<span id="v1_5_3_1818"><sup><small>1:5:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  The sacrificer, doubtless, (stands) behind the <i>g</i>uhû, and he who means evil to him, (stands) <span id="p150">[<sup><small>p. 150</small></sup>]</span> behind the upabh<i>ri</i>t: hence he thereby makes the spiteful enemy pay tribute to the sacrificer. The consumer, doubtless, (stands) behind the <i>g</i>uhû, and the one to be consumed behind the upabh<i>ri</i>t hence he thereby makes the one that is to be consumed pay tribute to the consumer. This is the reason why he pours (butter) together at the fourth fore-offering, that to the barhis.

<span id="v1_5_3_1919"><sup><small>1:5:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  He pours (the butter) together without (the two spoons) touching (each other). If he were to touch (the one spoon with the other) he would touch the sacrificer with his spiteful enemy, he would touch the consumer with the one to be consumed: for this reason he pours (the butter) together without touching.

<span id="v1_5_3_2020"><sup><small>1:5:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  He holds the <i>g</i>uhû over the upabh<i>ri</i>t). Thereby he keeps the sacrificer above his spiteful enemy, he keeps the consumer above the one to be consumed: for this reason he holds the <i>g</i>uhû over (the upabh<i>ri</i>t).

<span id="v1_5_3_2121"><sup><small>1:5:3:2121.</small></sup></span>  The gods once said, ‘Well then, now that the battle has been won, let us establish the entire sacrifice on a firm basis; and should the Asuras and Rakshas (again) trouble us, our sacrifice will then be firmly established!’

<span id="v1_5_3_2222"><sup><small>1:5:3:2222.</small></sup></span>  At the last fore-offering they established the entire sacrifice by means of the Svâhâ (‘hail!’). With ‘Svâhâ Agni!’ they established the butter-portion for Agni; with ‘Svâhâ Soma!’ they established the butter-portion for Soma; and with (the second) ‘Svâhâ Agni!’ they established that indispensable sacrificial cake which there is on both occasions (i.e. at the new- and full-moon sacrifices).

<span id="v1_5_3_2323"><sup><small>1:5:3:2323.</small></sup></span>  And so with the (other) deities <span id="p151">[<sup><small>p. 151</small></sup>]</span> respectively [^362]. With ‘Svâhâ the butter-drinking gods!’ they established the fore-offerings and the after-offerings (anuyâ<i>g</i>as), for the fore-offerings and after-offerings, doubtless, represent the butter-drinking gods. With the formula ‘May Agni graciously accept of the butter!’ they established Agni as Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (‘maker of good offering’), for Agni is indeed the maker of good offering. And till this day that sacrifice stands as firm as the gods established it. This is the reason why at the last fore-offering he prays with Svâhâ! Svâhâ!' according to the number of oblations (there are at the chief sacrifice). After he (the sacrificer) has won his battle, he establishes the entire sacrifice on a firm basis, so that, if after this he should violate the proper order of the sacrifice, he need not heed it; for he will know that his sacrifice is firmly established. Now what with exclaiming ‘Vashat,’ with offering, and with calling out ‘Svâhâ,’ this same sacrifice was well-nigh exhausted.

<span id="v1_5_3_2424"><sup><small>1:5:3:2424.</small></sup></span>  The gods were anxious as to how they might replenish it, how they might again render it efficient and practise (worshipping) with it, when efficient.

<span id="v1_5_3_2525"><sup><small>1:5:3:2525.</small></sup></span>  Now what was left in the <i>g</i>uhû of the butter wherewith they had established the sacrifice, with that they sprinkled the havis (dishes, or kinds, of sacrificial food) one after another, and thereby replenished them and again rendered them efficient, because the butter is indeed efficient. Hence after offering the last fore-offering, he sprinkles the havis one after another, and thereby replenishes them and again renders them efficient, because the butter is indeed efficient [^363]. Hence also from whatever sacrificial <span id="p152">[<sup><small>p. 152</small></sup>]</span> food he (afterwards at the principal oblations) cuts off (a portion for a deity), that he again sprinkles (with butter), that he replenishes and renders efficient for the (Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t) maker of good offering. But when he cuts off the portion for the maker of good offering, then he does not again sprinkle (the sacrificial food out of which the portion has been cut), since after that he will not make any other oblation in the fire from the sacrificial food [^364].


<span id="v1_5_4"><sup><small>1:5:4</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v1_5_4_11"><sup><small>1:5:4:11.</small></sup></span>  He (accordingly) pronounces the offering-prayer to the Samidhs (kindling-sticks). The Samidhs (kindlers), doubtless, are the breaths (vital airs), and he thereby kindles the breaths; for this man (the sacrificer) is kindled (animated) by his breaths: hence if he (the sacrificer) be burning (with fever, &c.), he (the Adhvaryu) will say, ‘Stroke (thyself)!’ If he be hot, then one may feel confident, for then he is kindled; and if he be cold, then one need hope no longer. Thus he thereby puts the breaths into him: this is the reason why he pronounces the prayer to the Samidhs.

<span id="v1_5_4_22"><sup><small>1:5:4:22.</small></sup></span>  He then pronounces the offering-prayer to Tanûnapât. Tanûnapât, doubtless, is seed; hence he thereby casts seed: this is why he pronounces the prayer to Tanûnapât. <span id="p153">[<sup><small>p. 153</small></sup>]</span> 1:5:4:33\. He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the I<i>d</i>s. The I<i>d</i>s, doubtless, are offspring; when the seed thus cast springs into life, then it moves about in quest of food, as it were, praising (î<i>d</i>). Hence he thereby makes him (the sacrificer) propagate offspring: this is the reason why he, pronounces the prayer to the I<i>d</i>s.

<span id="v1_5_4_44"><sup><small>1:5:4:44.</small></sup></span>  He then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Barhis. The barhis, doubtless, means abundance, hence he thereby produces an abundance: this is why he pronounces the prayer to the barhis.

<span id="v1_5_4_55"><sup><small>1:5:4:55.</small></sup></span>  He then pronounces the offering-prayer with ‘Svâhâ! Svâhâ!’ The Svâhâ-call, indeed, is what the winter is among the seasons; for the winter subjects these creatures to its will: hence in winter the plants wither, and the leaves fall off the trees; the birds retire more and more, and fly lower and lower; and the wicked man has his hair, as it were, falling off [^365]; for the winter subjects these creatures to its will. And, verily, he who knows this, makes that locality wherein he lives, his own, for his own happiness and supply of food.

<span id="v1_5_4_66"><sup><small>1:5:4:66.</small></sup></span>  The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, were once contending for superiority. With staves and bows neither party were able to overcome the other. Neither of them having gained the victory, they (the Asuras) said, ‘Well then, let us try to overcome one another by speech, by sacred writ (brahman)! He who cannot follow up our uttered speech by (making up) a pair, shall be defeated and lose everything, and the other party <span id="p154">[<sup><small>p. 154</small></sup>]</span> shall win everything!’ The gods replied, ‘So be it!’ The gods said to Indra, ‘Speak thou!’

<span id="v1_5_4_77"><sup><small>1:5:4:77.</small></sup></span>  Indra said, ‘One (eka, m., unus) for me!’ The others then said, ‘One (ekâ, f., una) for us!’ and thus found that (desired) pair, for eka (unus) and ekâ (una) make a pair.

<span id="v1_5_4_88"><sup><small>1:5:4:88.</small></sup></span>  Indra said, ‘Two (dvau, m., duo) for me!’ The others then said, ‘Two (dve, f., duae) for us!’ and thus found that pair, for dvau (duo) and dve (duae) make a pair.

<span id="v1_5_4_99"><sup><small>1:5:4:99.</small></sup></span>  Indra said, ‘Three (traya<i>h</i>, m.) for me!’ The others then said, ‘Three (tisra<i>h</i>, f.) for us!’ and thus found that pair, for traya<i>h</i>. and tisra<i>h</i> make a pair.

<span id="v1_5_4_1010"><sup><small>1:5:4:1010.</small></sup></span>  Indra said, ‘Four (<i>k</i>atvâra<i>h</i>, m.) for me!’ The others then said, ‘Four (<i>k</i>atasra<i>h</i>, f.) for us!’ and thus found that pair, for <i>k</i>atvâra<i>h</i> and <i>k</i>atasra<i>h</i> make a pair.

<span id="v1_5_4_1111"><sup><small>1:5:4:1111.</small></sup></span>  Indra said, ‘Five (pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a, m. f., quinque) for me!’ Then the others found no pair, for after that (numeral four) there is no pair, for then both (masculine and feminine) are pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a. Thereupon the Asuras were defeated and lost everything, and the gods won everything from the Asuras, and stripped their rivals, the Asuras, of everything.

<span id="v1_5_4_1212"><sup><small>1:5:4:1212.</small></sup></span>  For this reason let him (the sacrificer) say [^366], when the first fore-offering has been performed, ‘One (eka) for me!’ and ‘One (ekâ) for him whom <span id="p155">[<sup><small>p. 155</small></sup>]</span> we hate!’ And if he should not hate any one, let him say, ‘who hates us and whom we hate!’

<span id="v1_5_4_1313"><sup><small>1:5:4:1313.</small></sup></span>  With the second fore-offering, ‘Two (dvau) for me!’ and ‘Two (dve) for him who hates us and whom we hate!’

<span id="v1_5_4_1414"><sup><small>1:5:4:1414.</small></sup></span>  With the third fore-offering, ‘Three (traya<i>h</i>) for me!’ and ‘Three (tisra<i>h</i>) for him who hates us and whom we hate!’

<span id="v1_5_4_1515"><sup><small>1:5:4:1515.</small></sup></span>  With the fourth fore-offering, ‘Four (katvâra<i>h</i>) for me!’ and ‘Four (<i>k</i>atasra<i>h</i>) for him who hates us and whom we hate!’

<span id="v1_5_4_1616"><sup><small>1:5:4:1616.</small></sup></span>  With the fifth fore-offering, ‘Five (pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a) for me!’ and ‘Nothing for him who hates us and whom we hate!’ For, there being ‘five’ to five,' he (the enemy) is defeated, and whoever knows this, appropriates to himself everything that belongs to that (enemy of his), strips his enemies of everything.

## Footnotes

[^331]: 131:2 The Hot<i>ri</i>, on concluding the invitation of the gods, sits down with raised knees in the same place where he has been standing (see [p. 95](Book_1_1_3#p95), note [1](Book_1_1_3#fn263)), parts the sacrificial grass of the altar, and measures a span on the earth, with the text (Â<i>s</i>v. I, 3, 22), ‘Aditi is his mother, do not cut him off from the air. With the aid of p. 132 Agni, the god, the deity; with the threefold chant, with the râthantara-sâman, with the gâyatrî metre, with the agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice, with the vasha<i>t</i>\-call, the thunderbolt,—I here kill him who hates us, and whom we hate!’ The Adhvaryu having thereupon walked round the Hot<i>ri</i> from left to right, steps behind the utkara (heap of rubbish) with his face to the east and the fuel-band in his hand, and calls on (â<i>s</i>râvayati) the Âgnîdhra, with Õ <i>s</i>râvaya (or Õ<i>m</i> <i>s</i>râvaya, i.e. â <i>s</i>râvaya; or simply ‘<i>s</i>râvaya;’ cf. Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11). The Âgnîdhra (whilst standing north of the Adhvaryu, with his face to the south, and taking the wooden sword and the fuel-band from the Adhvaryu) responds (pratyâ<i>s</i>râvayati) by ‘astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>.’

[^332]: 132:1 See [p. 127](Book_1_1_4#p127), note [1](Book_1_1_4#fn321).

[^333]: 133:1 Thus our author. It should rather be ‘May (he) worship the gods, he the wise, the considerate one.’

[^334]: 133:2 Cf. [p. 115](Book_1_1_4#p115), note [1](Book_1_1_4#fn303).

[^335]: 134:1 Except the beginning, these formulas are entirely different from those given by Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>. I, 3, 23-24.

[^336]: 135:1 The yâ<i>g</i>yâs (offering-prayers) are the prayers which the Hot<i>ri</i> pronounces when the offerings are poured into the fire (this being done simultaneously with, or immediately after, the van shat, ‘may he carry it,’ with which the yâ<i>g</i>yâ ends, is pronounced). At the chief oblations the offering-prayer is preceded by an anuvâkyâ or puro ’nuvâkyâ (invitatory prayer) by which the gods are invited to come to the offering, and which ends with ‘om.’

[^337]: 136:1 Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa \[‘the hope or desire (â<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sâ) of man (nara)’\] is a mystical form of Agni, invoked chiefly in the Âprî-hymns at animal sacrifices. ‘Yathâ sarve ’pi narâ â sarvata<i>h</i> samsanti tathâvidhâya.’ Sâya<i>n</i>a.

[^338]: 136:2 See the legend I, 2, 3, 1 seq.

[^339]: 136:3 This and the succeeding formulas also are entirely different from those given in Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>. I, 3, 27 seq. The Sâṅkhây. <i>S</i>. I, 6 (Hillebrandt, Neu and Vollm. p. 91) seems to coincide, to some extent, with those given by our author.

[^340]: 136:4 The six spaces or wide expanses (urvî) are several times referred to in Vedic texts, but the conception seems to have been very vague. They are generally supposed to include the space above, the space below, and the four quarters. In Rig-veda VI, 47, 3-5 it is stated that they have been measured out p. 137 by Indra, and that outside of them there is no being (bhuvanam); and they are then enumerated thus: the expanse of the earth, the height (varshman,? highest point or sphere) of the sky (div), the sap (pîyûsha) in the three elevations \[? i.e. flowing, animating moisture, as rain, rivers, sap, &c.\], the atmosphere, the ocean (? ar<i>n</i>as,? of light, air), and the sky (div). The enumeration of six objects in Atharva-veda II, 12, 1 seems to refer to the same conception: heaven and earth (dyâvâp<i>ri</i>thivî), the wide atmospheric region, the genius (fem.) of the field (kshetrasya patnî), the far-strider (Sun, Light), the wide atmospheric region (uru-antariksham as before; cf. the double enumeration of div in the <i>Ri</i>k passage); and what has the Wind for its guardian (vâtagopa). Cf. Weber, Ind: Stud. XIII, p. 164. Sâ<i>n</i>kb. G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra I, 6, 4 gives heaven and earth, day and night, water and plants (St. Petersburg Dictionary s.v.).

[^341]: 137:1 According to the Kaushît. Br. VI, 10, Arvâvasu was the Brahman of the gods. Weber, Ind. Stud. II, 306.

[^342]: 137:2 The Hot<i>ri</i>'s seat stands north of the north-west corner of the altar, the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya fires being about equidistant from it towards south-east and south-west respectively.

[^343]: 138:1 Prâvitram, literally ‘that which promotes, protects’ (‘unser Hort’). Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5 explains it by' prak<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>am avitram phaladânarûpam asmadraksha<i>n</i>am yasmin homânush<i>th</i>âne tad idam prâvitram.' For this and the succeeding formulas, see Â<i>s</i>v. I, 4, 10-11.

[^344]: 139:1 Â<i>s</i>v. I, 4, 10, and Sâṅkh. I, 6 give as belonging to the text of the mantra: yo agni<i>m</i> hotâram av<i>ri</i>thâ<i>h</i>, ‘thou who hast chosen Agni for thy Hot<i>ri</i>;’ the same reading is mentioned in Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5.

[^345]: 139:2 Thus Sâya<i>n</i>a (âsyasva = haste dhâraya); ‘schöpfe ein (ladle in),’ St. Petersburg Dictionary; ‘pour into the fire,’ Hillebrandt, p. 93.

[^346]: 140:1 See p. 20, note 1.

[^347]: 140:2 The legend is intended to explain the origin and symbolical meaning of the call (â<i>s</i>râva<i>n</i>a) of the Adhvaryu (viz. O <i>s</i>râvaya! make listen!') and the response (pratyâ<i>s</i>rava<i>n</i>a) of the Âgnîdhra (viz. astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>!).

[^348]: 140:3 The sacrifice is the seed (vî<i>g</i>a) that produces heaven as its fruit. Sâya<i>n</i>a.

[^349]: 140:4 I.e. ‘even as they pass on from hand to hand a pail (gha<i>t</i>a) filled with water when a tub is to be filled inside the house.’ Sâya<i>n</i>a.

[^350]: 141:1 As soon as the Hot<i>ri</i> has pronounced the formula ‘O Adhvaryu, take up the spoon full of butter!’ (par. 2 above), the Adhvaryu takes the two offering-spoons (<i>g</i>uhû and upabh<i>ri</i>t) and steps back (from the west side along the north side of the altar and the west side of the fire) to the south side of the altar and the fire (the ya<i>g</i>ati-sthâna), and (with his face to north-east) utters his call, and (having been responded to by the Âgnîdhra) calls on the Hot<i>ri</i>: ‘samidho ya<i>g</i>a (pronounce the offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks)!’ Kâty. III, 2, 16.

[^351]: 142:1 See IV, 2, 5, 7-8.

[^352]: 142:2 (1) O <i>s</i>râvaya (for â srâvaya), the Adhvaryu's call; (2) astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i>, the Âgnîdhra's response; (3) (samidho) ya<i>g</i>a, the Adhvaryu's summons to the Hot<i>ri</i>; (4) ye ya<i>g</i>âmahe, the beginning of the Hot<i>ri</i>'s yâ<i>g</i>yâ, or offering-prayer (see [p. 135](Book_1_1_5#p135) note); (5) vausha<i>t</i>, concluding formula of the yâ<i>g</i>yâ.

[^354]: 143:1 For â<i>s</i>râvaya (cf. [p. 131](Book_1_1_4#p131), note [2](Book_1_1_5#fn329)), i.e. ‘bid (him, Agni, or them) hear!’ but the author here makes <i>s</i>râvaya the causative of <i>s</i>ru (sru), ‘to flow;’ hence â <i>s</i>râvaya, ‘make flow;’ and astu <i>s</i>rausha<i>t</i> \[properly ‘Yea, may he (or one) hear!’\] he makes ‘Yea, may it flow!’

[^355]: 143:2 A fanciful etymology of vasha<i>t</i> from root v<i>ri</i>sh, ‘to rain;’ for the true derivation of the word, see [p. 88](Book_1_1_3#p88), note [2](Book_1_1_3#fn254).

[^356]: 143:3 I.e. an offering made with a view to the obtainment of some special wish (kâmyesh<i>t</i>i).

[^357]: 143:4 Thus (or ‘they led it up to the udder of the cow’) Sâya<i>n</i>a p. 144 explains udanayan. In his commentary on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11 he interprets the analogous udanaishît by ‘he raises (or brings) the milk-pail;’ where the St. Petersburg Dictionary apparently takes it in the sense of ‘he led the calf away from the cow.’

[^358]: 144:1 In reality prayâ<i>g</i>a (from ya<i>g</i>, ‘to sacrifice’) has, of course, nothing to do with pra<i>g</i>aya (from <i>g</i>i, ‘to conquer’).

[^359]: 145:1 Though the author does not state expressly that this change of position in performing the five fore-offerings is advocated by some other ritualists, he apparently argues in this passage against an actually adopted theory and practice, which the Sûtras also mention as optional. In the case of the Adhvaryu changing his position, he is at each successive fore-offering to pour the butter on a part of the fire east of the preceding one. Kâty. III, 2, 18-21.

[^360]: 146:1 On the necessity of avoiding sameness of ritualistic practices cf. note on I, 3, 2, 8. The five fore-offerings (prayâ<i>g</i>a, here identified with the five seasons) are addressed respectively to the kindling-sticks (samidh), to Tanûnapât (or Narâ<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa, both mystical forms of Agni), to the I<i>d</i>s (personifications of the forms of devotional feeling), to the sacrificial grass-covering of the altar (barhis), and to Agni and Soma (or other deities). Since, in introducing the first fore-offering, the Adhvaryu has mentioned its recipient, he is not to do so in the case of the remaining four.

[^361]: 147:1 Such as lizards, alligators. Sâya<i>n</i>a.

[^362]: 148:1 See further on, par. 22. As to Svâhâ! marking the conclusion of the sacrifice, see the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us I, 9, 2, 25-28.

[^363]: 148:2 The first offering-prayer (to the logs) is ‘yê ya<i>g</i>âmahe samidha<i>h</i>, samidho agna â<i>g</i>yasya vyantû vâusha<i>t</i>!’ i.e. ‘we who pronounce the offering-prayer to the Samidhs,—the Samidhs, O Agni, may accept the butter! vâusha<i>t</i>!’ Similarly at the other fore-offerings; but at the second and fourth, where the object of worship is a single one (viz. Tanûnapât and the Barhis respectively), ‘may he (or it) accept (vetu)!’ has to be substituted for ‘may they accept (vyantu)!’ The difference of number in these verbal forms is symbolically explained as implying a distinction of sex, for the reason that there may be more wives to one man, but only one husband to a woman. The elliptic expression ye ya<i>g</i>âmahe is thus explained by Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11: ‘All we Hot<i>ri</i> priests that are urged on by the Adhvaryu calling “Recite (thou)!” we do recite, we do pronounce p. 149 the yâ<i>g</i>yâ.’ This introductory part of the offering-formula is called âgur, ‘acclamation, assent’ (Â<i>s</i>v. I, 5, 4); it is alluded to in Mahâbhâr. Vanap. I2480 (cf. Muir, O. S. T. I, p. 135), and apparently by Pâ<i>n</i>. VIII, 2, 88 (cf. Haug, Ait. Br. II, p. 133 n.).

[^364]: 149:1 In making the oblation, the Adhvaryu holds the <i>g</i>uhû over the upabh<i>ri</i>t and pours some of the butter from the <i>g</i>uhû over the spout of the upabh<i>ri</i>t into the fire. At the third prayâ<i>g</i>a he empties all the butter remaining in the <i>g</i>uhû into the fire, and thereupon, for the fourth oblation, replenishes the empty spoon with half the contents of the upabh<i>ri</i>t, after which he proceeds as before.

[^365]: 151:1 Cf. [p. 118](Book_1_1_4#p118), note [3](Book_1_1_4#fn309). The words ‘Svâhâ Agnim’ &c. are preceded by ‘ye ya<i>g</i>âmahe,’ see before, [p. 148](#p148), note [^360].

[^366]: 151:2 After the Adhvaryu has performed the last fore-offering, he p. 152 steps back behind the altar and sitting down beside the dishes of sacrificial food, anoints, with the butter remaining in the <i>g</i>uhû, first the (butter in the) dhruvâ, then the several sacrificial dishes; and finally the (butter in the) upabh<i>ri</i>t. Kâty. III, 3, 9.

[^367]: 152:1 What remains of the dish of sacrificial food, after the oblation to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (I, 7, 3, 1 seq.) has been made, is eaten by the priests and the sacrificer, and in their case the several portions are basted with butter, as they are cut off, but not the dish of food from which the portions have been taken.

[^368]: 153:1 The Kâ<i>n</i>va recension has, ‘the beasts retire more and more, and the birds fly lower and lower; and the vile-caste man (pâpavar<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> purusha<i>h</i>) has his hair, as it were, falling off.’

[^369]: 154:1 Viz. as anumantra<i>n</i>a, or after-call, supplementary prayer, pronounced immediately after the oblation has been poured into the fire. According to Kâty. III, 3, 5, a second anumantra<i>n</i>a has to be added each time, consisting of a single word, viz. ‘brilliant,’ ‘respectable,’ ‘famous,’ ‘holy,’ ‘an eater of food’ \[suppl. ‘may I become’\] respectively. Differently the Black Ya<i>g</i>us; cf. Hillebrandt, p. 96, note 6.
