### THE SÂVITRA LIBATIONS.

## THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_3_1_11"><sup><small>6:3:1:11.</small></sup></span>  The gods then said, ‘Meditate ye!’ whereby doubtless they meant to say, ‘Seek ye a layer!’ Whilst they were meditating, Savit<i>ri</i> saw those Sâvitra (formulas); and inasmuch as Savit<i>ri</i> saw them, they are called Sâvitra. He offered that eightfold-taken libation; and when he had offered it, he saw this eightfold-appointed Ashâ<i>dh</i>â [^394], which had been created aforetime. <span id="p191"><sup><small>[ p. 191 ]</small></sup></span> 6:3:1:22\. Now when they said, ‘Meditate ye!’ they doubtless meant to say, ‘Seek ye a layer!’ and inasmuch as they saw it whilst meditating (<i>k</i>etay), therefore it is a layer (<i>k</i>iti). And the libation is a sacrifice; and inasmuch as he saw it after sacrificing (ish<i>t</i>vâ), it is a brick (ish<i>t</i>akâ).

<span id="v6_3_1_33"><sup><small>6:3:1:33.</small></sup></span>  Now that same (libation of ghee), while being a single one, he offers as an eightfold one [^395] with eight formulas: whence this (‘invincible’ brick), while being a single one, is eightfold appointed.

<span id="v6_3_1_44"><sup><small>6:3:1:44.</small></sup></span>  He offers while raising upwards (the spoon);—he thereby raises this earth upwards by means of its forms [^396]: whence this earth is raised (above the water) by its forms.

<span id="v6_3_1_55"><sup><small>6:3:1:55.</small></sup></span>  He offers it continuously;—for at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should come thither after them! They saw that continuous libation for preventing the Rakshas, the fiends, from coming after them: hence he offers it continuously.

<span id="v6_3_1_66"><sup><small>6:3:1:66.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he offers that libation;—this Agni is Savit<i>ri</i>, and him he gratifies at the outset by this libation; and having sacrificed to, and gratified, him (Agni), he then puts him together. And inasmuch as by this (libation) he gratifies Savit<i>ri</i>, they (the formulas are called) Sâvitra: that is why he offers this libation. <span id="p192"><sup><small>[ p. 192 ]</small></sup></span> 6:3:1:77\. And, again, why he offers this libation;—this Agni is Savit<i>ri</i>, and him he pours out as seed at the outset by this libation; and whatlike seed is poured into the womb suchlike (offspring) is born. And inasmuch as by this (libation) he pours out Savit<i>ri</i> as seed, they (the offering-formulas are called) Sâvitra: that is why he offers this libation.

<span id="v6_3_1_88"><sup><small>6:3:1:88.</small></sup></span>  Both an offering-spoon (sru<i>k</i>) and a dipping-spoon (sruva) are used thereat; for the offering-spoon is speech, and the dipping-spoon is breath; and with speech and breath the gods sought this sacred rite at the beginning: hence there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon.

<span id="v6_3_1_99"><sup><small>6:3:1:99.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon,—what Pra<i>g</i>âpati was, that indeed is this dipping-spoon, for the dipping-spoon is the breath, and the breath is Pra<i>g</i>âpati. And what Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) was, that is this offering-spoon; for Vâ<i>k</i> is a female, and the offering-spoon (sru<i>k</i>, f.) is a female; and those waters which went forth from the world of Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) [^397], they are this (ghee) which he offers (in) this libation.

<span id="v6_3_1_1010"><sup><small>6:3:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  He offers it continuously, for those waters flowed continuously. And inasmuch as that Pra<i>g</i>âpati entered the waters with the threefold science [^398], that is these prayers (ya<i>g</i>us) with which this (priest) now offers.

<span id="v6_3_1_1111"><sup><small>6:3:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  The first three which there are, are these (three) worlds; and what fourth prayer there is that <span id="p193"><sup><small>[ p. 193 ]</small></sup></span> is the threefold science, that is the <i>G</i>agatî,—the <i>G</i>agatî being all the metres, and all the metres (making up) the threefold science; and what last four (prayers) there are, they are the quarters: now Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed is those worlds and the quarters; and that (<i>g</i>agatî verse in the middle) is the threefold science.

<span id="v6_3_1_1212"><sup><small>6:3:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 1), ‘Harnessing first the mind,’—Pra<i>g</i>âpati, assuredly, is he that harnesses, he harnessed the mind for that holy work; and because he harnessed the mind for that holy work, therefore he is the harnessing one.

<span id="v6_3_1_1313"><sup><small>6:3:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  ‘Savit<i>ri</i>, stretching out the thoughts,’—for Savit<i>ri</i> is the mind, and the thoughts are the vital airs;—'gazing reverently at Agni's light,'—that is, having seen Agni's light;—‘bore up from the earth;’ for upwards from the earth he indeed bears this (offering).

<span id="v6_3_1_1414"><sup><small>6:3:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 2\] ‘With harnessed mind we,’—he thereby harnesses the mind for this work, for with unharnessed mind one cannot now do anything;—‘at the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i>,’—that is impelled (sped) by the god Savit<i>ri</i>,—‘with power (we strive) for the heavenly;’—‘that by this holy work he may go to the heavenly world,’ he thereby means to say; ‘with power,’ he says, for by power (energy) one goes to the heavenly world.

<span id="v6_3_1_1515"><sup><small>6:3:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 3\] ‘Savit<i>ri</i>, having harnessed the gods,’—Savit<i>ri</i> is the mind, and the gods are the vital airs;—‘going by thought to the light, to heaven,’—for as such as are going to the heavenly world by thought (devotion) he has harnessed them for this holy work;—‘going to produce a mighty light,’—the mighty light assuredly is yonder sun, and <span id="p194"><sup><small>[ p. 194 ]</small></sup></span> he is this Agni, and him they are indeed going to fit together (or, restore);—‘may Savit<i>ri</i> speed them!’—that is, ‘may they perform this holy work, sped by Savit<i>ri</i>.’

<span id="v6_3_1_1616"><sup><small>6:3:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 4\] ‘They harness the mind, and they harness the thoughts,’—for both the mind and the vital airs he harnesses for this holy work;—‘the priests of the priest,’—the priest is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the priests are the gods;—‘of the great inspirer of devotion,’—the great inspirer of devotion [^399] is Pra<i>g</i>âpati;—‘he hath assigned the priestly offices,’—now when he (Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati) is built up, then he assigns the priestly offices, for the priestly offices are assigned over the built-up (fire-altar);—‘the finder of rites,’—for he indeed found this rite;—‘he alone,’ for he alone found this whole holy rite;—‘mighty is the praise of the god Savit<i>ri</i>,’—that is, ‘great is the praise of the god Savit<i>ri</i>.’

<span id="v6_3_1_1717"><sup><small>6:3:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 5 <i>Ri</i>k S. X, 13, 1\] ‘By devotions I harness your old inspiration,’—the old inspiration (brahman) doubtless is the vital air, and devotion is food, and that food is this oblation: by means of this oblation, by means of this food, he harnesses the vital airs for this holy work,—'May the praise spread abroad on the lord's path,'—this he says in order that there may be for the Sacrificer the praise of fame among both gods and men;—‘may all sons of the immortal hear!’—the immortal one doubtless is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and his sons are all the gods;—‘who have resorted <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> to the heavenly abodes;’—the heavenly abodes are these worlds: the gods that are in these worlds, with regard to them he says this.

<span id="v6_3_1_1818"><sup><small>6:3:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 6; <i>Ri</i>k S. V, 81, 3\] ‘Whose course the others have followed,’—for Pra<i>g</i>âpati first performed this rite, whereupon the gods performed it;—'the gods with vigour, the god's greatness,'—the greatness is the sacrifice, thus: 'the gods with vigour (followed) the god's sacrifice, his energy;'—‘that dappled steed who hath measured the terrestrial (regions),’—whatsoever is on this earth that is terrestrial, all that he measures out; for with his rays he reaches down to it;—‘the regions, he the god Savit<i>ri</i> by his greatness,’—the regions are these worlds, and the god Savit<i>ri</i> is yonder sun: he measures them by his greatness.

<span id="v6_3_1_1919"><sup><small>6:3:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 7\] ‘God Savit<i>ri</i>, speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his share!’—the god Savit<i>ri</i> is yonder sun, and his share is the sacrifice, that he means to say when he says ‘speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice!’—‘May the heavenly, thought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought!’—the heavenly Gandharva is yonder sun, and thought is (sacrificial) food; thus, ‘May the food-cleanser cleanse our food!’—‘May the lord of speech render agreeable our speech!’—this sacred rite is speech, and the lord of speech is the breath: thus, 'May the breath render agreeable this rite of ours!!

<span id="v6_3_1_2020"><sup><small>6:3:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 8\] ‘Further, O god Savit<i>ri</i>, this our sacrifice!’—the god Savit<i>ri</i> is yonder sun, and whatever sacrificial rite he furthers, that <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> reaches its end safely and auspiciously;—‘as one pleasant to the gods,’—that is, as one which shall please the gods;—‘friend-gaining, ever-winning, wealth-winning, heaven-winning,’—that is, one that may gain all this;—‘Make the hymn-tune successful with the <i>ri</i><i>k</i> (verse), the Rathantara with the Gâyatra (metre), and the B<i>ri</i>hat, moving in Gâyatra measures!’—thus the sâmans (hymns);—‘Hail!’ thus the sacrificial formulas: this threefold science is first produced, even as it was there and then produced. And the Agni who was produced, he is this Agni (fire-altar) who is built up from hence upwards.

<span id="v6_3_1_2121"><sup><small>6:3:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  These then are the eight Sâvitra (formulas [^400]);—the Gâyatrî has eight syllables, and Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by just so much he pours him out as seed. There are nine of them, the call of ‘Hail’ (being) the ninth,—there are nine regions, and Agni is the regions; nine vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is. his measure, by so much he pours him out as seed. There are ten of them, the libation (being) the tenth,—the Virâ<i>g</i> has ten syllables, and Agni is Virâ<i>g</i> (the widely shining [^401]); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

<span id="v6_3_1_2222"><sup><small>6:3:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  This libation having been offered, Agni went away from the gods. The gods said, ‘Agni is the <span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span> cattle (or, an animal), let us search for him by means of the (different kinds of) cattle: he will become manifest unto his own form.’ They searched for him by means of the cattle, and he became manifest to his own form: and hence even to this day the animal becomes manifest to its own form (kind) [^402], cow to cow, horse to horse, and man to man.

<span id="v6_3_1_2323"><sup><small>6:3:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Surely, if we search with all of them, they will become used up and affording no livelihood; and if not with all, we shall get him (Agni) incomplete.’ They saw one animal (as a substitute) for two animals [^403], namely, the ass (as a substitute) for the cow and the sheep; and because they saw that one beast (would do) for two beasts, therefore that one (the he-ass), whilst being one, doubly impregnates [^404].

<span id="v6_3_1_2424"><sup><small>6:3:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  The sham-man [^405] (they saw to be a substitute) for man,—a sham-man doubtless is he who pleases neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor men. Thus they searched by means of all the beasts, and yet they (the beasts) did not come to be used up and affording no livelihood.

<span id="v6_3_1_2525"><sup><small>6:3:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  With three he searches,—Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him. They are five <span id="p198"><sup><small>[ p. 198 ]</small></sup></span> by way of (mystic) correspondence [^406],—Agni (the fire-altar) has five layers; five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

<span id="v6_3_1_2626"><sup><small>6:3:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  They are fastened with halters of reed-grass to guard (Agni) against injury [^407];—Agni went away from the gods; he entered into a reed, whence it is hollow, and whence inside it is, as it were, smoke-tinged: (thus) that, the reed, is Agni's womb, and Agni is these cattle; and the womb does not injure the child. For [^408] it is from a womb that he who is born is born: ‘from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,’ thus he thinks.

<span id="v6_3_1_2727"><sup><small>6:3:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  They (the halters) are triple (strings), for Agni is threefold. They are made like a horse's halter, for the horse's halter lies all round the mouth, and the womb lies all round the child: thus it is made like the womb.

<span id="v6_3_1_2828"><sup><small>6:3:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  They (the animals) stand facing the east, first the horse, then the ass, then the he-goat; for this <span id="p199"><sup><small>[ p. 199 ]</small></sup></span> is their proper order. For that horse (a<i>s</i>va) is the tear (a<i>s</i>ru) which there (at the creation) formed itself; and that ass (râsabha) is that which, as it were, cried (ras); and that he-goat (a<i>g</i>a, unborn) is the juice which adhered to the shell; and that clay which they are about to fetch is nothing else than the shell (of the egg): for it was from these forms that he was created at first [^409], and from them he thus produces him.

<span id="v6_3_1_2929"><sup><small>6:3:1:2929.</small></sup></span>  They stand on the south side;—for the gods at that time were afraid, lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite their sacrifice from the south. They saw that thunderbolt, yonder sun; for this horse is indeed yonder sun; and by means of that thunderbolt they drove off the Rakshas, the fiends, from the south, and spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now by this thunderbolt drive off the Rakshas, the fiends, from the south, and spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.

<span id="v6_3_1_3030"><sup><small>6:3:1:3030.</small></sup></span>  On the right (south) side is the Âhavanîya fire, and on the left (north) lies that spade; for the Âhavanîya (m.) is a male, and the spade (abhri, f.) a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female [^410]. \[It lies\] at a cubit's distance, for at a cubit's distance the male lies by the female.

<span id="v6_3_1_3131"><sup><small>6:3:1:3131.</small></sup></span>  It should be made of bamboo. Agni went away from the gods. He entered into a bamboo-stem; whence that is hollow. On both sides he made himself those fences, the knots, so as not <span id="p200"><sup><small>[ p. 200 ]</small></sup></span> to be found out; and wherever he burnt through, those spots came to be.

<span id="v6_3_1_3232"><sup><small>6:3:1:3232.</small></sup></span>  It (the spade) should be spotted, for such a one is of Agni's nature. If he cannot procure a spotted one, it may be unspotted, but hollow it must be, to guard (Agni) from injury [^411];—(for) such a one alone is of Agni's nature; that, the bamboo, is Agni's womb; and this (lump of) clay is Agni; and the womb does not injure the child. For it is from a womb that he who is born is born: ‘from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,’ so he thinks.

<span id="v6_3_1_3333"><sup><small>6:3:1:3333.</small></sup></span>  It may be a span long, for the voice here speaks but as far as a span's distance [^412]. It is, however, a cubit long, for the cubit is the arm, and strength is exerted by the arm: it thus becomes equal to his strength.

<span id="v6_3_1_3434"><sup><small>6:3:1:3434.</small></sup></span>  It may be sharp on one side only, for on one of the two sides is there a keen edge to this speech of ours [^413]. But indeed it is one that is sharp on both sides, for on both sides is there a keen edge to this speech of curs, inasmuch as it speaks both what is divine and what is human [^414], and both truth and untruth: therefore it is one that is sharp on both sides. <span id="p201"><sup><small>[ p. 201 ]</small></sup></span> 6:3:1:3535\. And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,—the strength of the spade doubtless is on that side on which there is its sharp edge: he thus lays strength into it on both sides.

<span id="v6_3_1_3636"><sup><small>6:3:1:3636.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,—when the gods had there discovered him (Agni), they dug him out from these worlds; and in like manner does he now, after discovering him, dig him out from these worlds.

<span id="v6_3_1_3737"><sup><small>6:3:1:3737.</small></sup></span>  When it digs thus (downwards), then it digs him out from this world; and when it moves upwards, then from yonder world; and when it moves about between the two, then from the air-world: it thus digs him out from all these worlds.

<span id="v6_3_1_3838"><sup><small>6:3:1:3838.</small></sup></span>  He takes it up, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 9), ‘At the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i>, I take thee by the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, by the hands of Pûshan, by the Gâyatrî metre, Aṅgiras-like!’ By means of those deities he thus takes it up, impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>; by the Gâyatrî metre: he thus imparts the Gâyatrî metre to it. 'From the Earth's seat, Aṅgiras-like, bring thou Agni Purîshya [^415]!'— <span id="p202"><sup><small>[ p. 202 ]</small></sup></span> now soil means cattle: thus, 'from the earth's lap bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!'—‘by the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!’ he thereby takes it with the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre and thus lays into it the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre.

<span id="v6_3_1_3939"><sup><small>6:3:1:3939.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 10\] ‘A spade thou art,’—for a spade it is: he thus takes it by means of the truth;—‘A woman thou art!’—the spade is a thunderbolt, and the woman is a female, and a female injures no one: he thus appeases it so as not to do any injury. ‘By thee may we be able to dig out Agni in the seat!’ the seat no doubt is this (spot): thus, ‘By thee may we be able to dig out Agni in this seat (place).’—‘By the <i>G</i>agatî metre, Aṅgiras-like!’ he thus takes it up by means of the <i>G</i>agatî metre, and lays the <i>G</i>agatî metre into it.

<span id="v6_3_1_4040"><sup><small>6:3:1:4040.</small></sup></span>  With three (formulas) he takes it up,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus takes it. Having taken it up with three (formulas), he addresses it with a fourth; for the gods having thus taken it with three (formulas), then laid vigour into it by means of a fourth; and in like manner does he now, after taking it up with three (formulas), lay strength into it with the fourth.

<span id="v6_3_1_4141"><sup><small>6:3:1:4141.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 11\] ‘Having taken into his hand, Savit<i>ri</i>,’—for it has indeed been taken into his (the Adhvaryu's) hand,—‘bearing the spade,’—for he indeed bears it,—‘the golden,’—for golden indeed is the one that consists of the metres (the Veda);—'beholding Agni's light,'—that is, seeing Agni's light,—‘lifted it up from the earth,’—for he indeed lifts it up from the earth;—‘by the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre, Aṅgiras-like;’—he thus takes <span id="p203"><sup><small>[ p. 203 ]</small></sup></span> it up by means of the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre, and lays the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre into it: for his undertaking that spade of bamboo is thus made to be those metres.

<span id="v6_3_1_4242"><sup><small>6:3:1:4242.</small></sup></span>  Some, indeed, make it of gold, saying, ‘It is spoken of as golden.’ Let him not do so: in that it is the metres, thereby that (spade) is gold, immortal gold, the immortal metres.

<span id="v6_3_1_4343"><sup><small>6:3:1:4343.</small></sup></span>  He takes it up with four (formulas), for all speech consists of four syllables: ‘vâk’ (speech) is one syllable, and ‘aksharam’ (syllable) consists of three syllables. Now that monosyllable ‘vâk’ is the same as this last one, the Anush<i>t</i>ubh; and that trisyllable ‘aksharam’ is the same as those former formulas: he thus digs up Agni by the whole speech, and equips it with the whole speech,—hence with four (formulas).

<span id="v6_3_1_4444"><sup><small>6:3:1:4444.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why with four (formulas);—there are four quarters: he thus lays speech into the four quarters, whence speech speaks in the four quarters. He takes it up both by metres and by formulas, that makes eight—there are four quarters, and four intermediate quarters: he thus lays speech into all the quarters, whence speech speaks in all the quarters.


<span id="v6_3_2"><sup><small>6:3:2</small></sup></span>

### THE SEARCH AND DIGGING FOR AGNI

###(THE LUMP OF CLAY).

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_3_2_11"><sup><small>6:3:2:11.</small></sup></span>  The spade is still in his hand, when he addresses the beasts. For when the gods at that time were about to search (for Agni) in these (animals) they placed their vigour in front; and in like manner does <span id="p204"><sup><small>[ p. 204 ]</small></sup></span> this one, now that he is about to search in these (animals), place his vigour in front.

<span id="v6_3_2_22"><sup><small>6:3:2:22.</small></sup></span>  He addresses the horse, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 12), ‘Most speedily [^416], O courser, run hither,’—what is swift, that is speedy, and what is swifter than swift, that is most speedy;—‘along the widest range,’—the widest range doubtless is this (earth): thus, ‘along this wide range;’—‘in the sky is thy highest home, in the air thy navel, upon earth thy womb:’ he thus makes it to be those deities, Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya (the sun), and thus lays vigour into the horse.

<span id="v6_3_2_33"><sup><small>6:3:2:33.</small></sup></span>  Then the ass, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 13), ‘Yoke ye two the ass,’ he says this to the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer;—‘upon this course, ye showerers of wealth!’—that is, ‘upon this performance, ye showerers of wealth;’—‘him, bearing Agni, and helpful [^417] unto us;’—that is, ‘him, bearing Agni, and urged forward by us:’ he thereby lays vigour into the ass.

<span id="v6_3_2_44"><sup><small>6:3:2:44.</small></sup></span>  Then the he-goat, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 14), ‘At every yoking, at every race, we call him, the most powerful,’—race [^418] means food: thus, ‘in every performance, in respect of every food we call him, the most powerful;’—‘Indra to our help, we his friends!’—that is, ‘him, the strong (indriyavat), to our help:’ he thereby lays vigour into the he-goat.

<span id="v6_3_2_55"><sup><small>6:3:2:55.</small></sup></span>  With three (formulas) he addresses (the victims),—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as <span id="p205"><sup><small>[ p. 205 ]</small></sup></span> great as is his measure, by so much he thus lays vigour into them.

<span id="v6_3_2_66"><sup><small>6:3:2:66.</small></sup></span>  He then makes them walk forward to the east: he thus searches for him (Agni) by means of these animals. He does not touch (them) lest he, Agni, should injure him; for Agni is the same as the animals [^419].

<span id="v6_3_2_77"><sup><small>6:3:2:77.</small></sup></span>  He makes the horse walk on, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 15), ‘Forth-speeding, come treading down the curses!’—curse means evil: thus, ‘running come, treading down the evil!’—'come, delighting, into Rudra's chieftainship!'—beasts belong to Rudra: thus, ‘come thou, delighting, into the chieftainship of him who is thy deity!’ he thus searches for him by means of the horse.

<span id="v6_3_2_88"><sup><small>6:3:2:88.</small></sup></span>  Then the ass with, Traverse the wide air, thou possessed of prosperous pastures and affording safety!'—as the text, so its meaning;—‘with Pûshan as thy mate;’—Pûshan, doubtless, is this earth; thus, ‘together with her as thy mate:’ he thus searches for him by means of the ass.

<span id="v6_3_2_99"><sup><small>6:3:2:99.</small></sup></span>  Then the he-goat, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 16), 'From the Earth's seat, Aṅgiras-like, bring thou Agni Purîshya!'—that is, 'from the Earth's lap bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!' he thus searches for him (Agni) by means of the he-goat.

<span id="v6_3_2_1010"><sup><small>6:3:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  With three (animals) he searches,—threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him. <span id="p206"><sup><small>[ p. 206 ]</small></sup></span> By three (formulas) he first addresses (the beasts); that makes six,—six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.


<span id="v6_3_3"><sup><small>6:3:3</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v6_3_3_11"><sup><small>6:3:3:11.</small></sup></span>  Those fires have been kindled (afresh); and they (the priests and sacrificer) betake themselves to the lump of clay [^420];—those fires doubtless are these worlds: when they are kindled, then they are these worlds. For formerly the gods were seeking this sacred rite outside of these worlds; and when he fetches the lump of clay after passing by those fires, he is seeking him (Agni) outside of these worlds.

<span id="v6_3_3_22"><sup><small>6:3:3:22.</small></sup></span>  They go eastwards; for the east is Agni's region: he thus seeks him in his own region, finds him in his own region.

<span id="v6_3_3_33"><sup><small>6:3:3:33.</small></sup></span>  They go forward, with, ‘Aṅgiras-like, we go to Agni Purîshya;’—that is, ‘like Agni, we are going to Agni, favourable to cattle.’

<span id="v6_3_3_44"><sup><small>6:3:3:44.</small></sup></span>  He then looks at the sham-man, with, ‘Aṅgiras-like, we shall carry Agni Purîshya;’—that is, ‘Like Agni, we shall carry Agni, favourable to cattle:’ he thus searches for him by means of the sham-man.

<span id="v6_3_3_55"><sup><small>6:3:3:55.</small></sup></span>  Thereupon a hollow ant-hill is laid down midways (between the lump of clay and the Âhavanîya fire). He looks along it [^421]; for the ant-hill is this <span id="p207"><sup><small>[ p. 207 ]</small></sup></span> earth, and this earth is these worlds. For the gods searched for him (Agni) in these worlds part by part; and in like manner does this one now search for him in these worlds part by part.

<span id="v6_3_3_66"><sup><small>6:3:3:66.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 17\] ‘Agni hath looked along the crest of the Dawns,’—thereby they sought him in the dawns;—‘along the days, he, the first knower of beings,’—thereby they sought him in the days;—‘and oftentimes along the rays of the sun,’—thereby they sought him in the rays of the sun;—‘along the sky and the earth hast thou spread;’—therewith they sought him in the sky and the earth, and found him; and in like manner does this one thereby find him (Agni). When he sees him from afar, he throws down that (ant-hill); and they go up to the lump of clay.

<span id="v6_3_3_77"><sup><small>6:3:3:77.</small></sup></span>  He then addresses the horse; for the gods then said, ‘Let us drive away his evil!’ Now evil is weariness: thus, ‘Let us drive away his weariness, the evil!’ They drove away his weariness, the evil; and in like manner does this one now drive away his weariness, the evil.

<span id="v6_3_3_88"><sup><small>6:3:3:88.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 18\] ‘The courser, having started on his way,’—for his way has indeed been started upon;—‘shaketh off all assaults,’—assaults mean evils: thus, ‘shakes off all evils;’ and hence, indeed, the horse, whilst running, shakes itself;—‘Agni he seeks to descry with his eye on the great seat;’—the great seat doubtless is this sacrificial (place): thus, ‘Agni he wishes to see with his eye on this great seat.’

<span id="v6_3_3_99"><sup><small>6:3:3:99.</small></sup></span>  He then makes it (the horse) step on (the lump of clay with the left fore-foot); for having discovered him (Agni), it (the horse) then indicated <span id="p208"><sup><small>[ p. 208 ]</small></sup></span> him to the gods, as if (it meant to say) [^422], ‘Just here he is!’

<span id="v6_3_3_1010"><sup><small>6:3:3:1010.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he makes it step thereon;—the gods then were afraid, thinking, ‘We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not slay here this our (Agni)!’ They placed that thunderbolt upon him as a protector, to wit, yonder sun; for that horse is indeed yonder sun; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer, or priest) now place upon him that thunderbolt as a protector.

<span id="v6_3_3_1111"><sup><small>6:3:3:1111.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 19\] ‘Having come upon the earth, O courser, seek thou Agni by thy light!’—the light is the eye: thus, ‘Having come to the earth, thou, O courser, seek Agni with thy eye!’—‘by pawing [^423] the ground tell us where we may dig him out!’—that is, ‘by pointing out that (spot) of the ground tell us where we may dig him out.’

<span id="v6_3_3_1212"><sup><small>6:3:3:1212.</small></sup></span>  He then pulls it up [^424]; for the gods now endowed it with vigour (for) having indicated (Agni) to them; and in like manner does this one now endow it with vigour (for) having indicated (Agni) to him. He does so, with \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 20\], ‘The sky is thy back, the earth thy resting-place, the air thy body, the sea thy womb;’—whereby he says, ‘Such <span id="p209"><sup><small>[ p. 209 ]</small></sup></span> thou art, such thou art;’—‘Looking about with thine eye, tread down the assailers!’—that is, ‘Looking about with thy eye, tread down all evildoers!’ He does not touch it, lest this thunderbolt should injure him, for the horse is a thunderbolt [^425].

<span id="v6_3_3_1313"><sup><small>6:3:3:1313.</small></sup></span>  He then makes it step off (the lump of clay);—for the gods now said, ‘What shall we cause it to obtain [^426]?’—‘Great beauty [^427]!’—They caused it to obtain great beauty; and in like manner does this one now cause it to obtain great beauty,—with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 21), ‘Go thou unto great beauty!’—that is, ‘Go to thy great beauty!’ and therefore, indeed, the horse is the most highly-favoured of animals;—‘from this standing-place,’—that is, ‘where thou now standest;’—‘wealth-giver!’—for wealth it does give them;—‘Courser!’—for this is a courser;—'May we be in the Earth's favour, whilst Agni we dig in her lap!'—that is, ‘May we be in the favour of this earth, whilst digging (for) Agni in her lap!’

<span id="v6_3_3_1414"><sup><small>6:3:3:1414.</small></sup></span>  When it has stepped off he addresses it;—for as one would extol him who has given a gift, so the gods now praised and magnified it (for) having indicated (Agni); and in like manner does this one now praise and magnify it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 22), ‘He hath come down,’—for it has indeed come down,—‘the wealth-giver,’—for wealth, indeed, is given them; ‘the racing courser,’—for it is indeed a racer and a courser;—‘hath made good, well-made room on earth,’—that is, ‘thou madest good, well-made room on earth;’—‘thence let us <span id="p210"><sup><small>[ p. 210 ]</small></sup></span> dig out the fair-looking Agni,’—‘fair-looking,’ he says, for Agni is indeed fair-looking on every side;—‘ascending the heaven, unto the highest sky,’—the sky is the heavenly world: thus, ‘mounting the heavenly world, unto the highest sky.’ He makes it come up on the right side (of the lump) to where the two other beasts are: they stand on the right side, facing the east. The significance of the right-hand (southern) position here is the same as it was on that former occasion.

<span id="v6_3_3_1515"><sup><small>6:3:3:1515.</small></sup></span>  Sitting down he now offers upon the lump of clay;—for the gods then said, ‘Meditate ye (<i>k</i>etay),’ whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, ‘Seek ye a layer (<i>k</i>iti)!’ Whilst meditating they saw this libation, and offered it: after offering it, they saw the fire-pan (representing) these worlds.

<span id="v6_3_3_1616"><sup><small>6:3:3:1616.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Meditate ye!’ whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, ‘Seek ye a layer!’ Whilst meditating they saw this second libation, and offered it: after offering it, they saw the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis (all-light bricks), that is, those deities Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya; for these deities are indeed all the light. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after offering those two libations, see the fire-pan, these worlds; and those all-light deities. He offers with two interlinked (verses) [^428]: he thereby interlinks these worlds, and those deities.

<span id="v6_3_3_1717"><sup><small>6:3:3:1717.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he offers these two libations;—he thereby gratifies both the clay and the water; and having offered to, and gratified, these two, he then brings them together. With two interlinked <span id="p211"><sup><small>[ p. 211 ]</small></sup></span> (verses) he offers: he thereby interlinks (combines thoroughly) the clay and the water.

<span id="v6_3_3_1818"><sup><small>6:3:3:1818.</small></sup></span>  He offers with ghee; for the ghee is a thunderbolt: he thus makes the thunderbolt its (or his, Agni's) protector. The ghee, moreover, is seed: he thus pours forth seed,—with the sruva-spoon; for the sruva (m.) is a male, and the male pours forth seed,—with ‘Svâhâ (hail!),’ for the Svâhâkâra (m.) is a male, and the male pours forth seed.

<span id="v6_3_3_1919"><sup><small>6:3:3:1919.</small></sup></span>  \[^429]\] ‘Upon thee I sprinkle with thought, with ghee,’—that is, ‘upon thee I offer with thought and ghee;’—‘that dwellest near all beings,’—for he (Agni) indeed comes to dwell near every being;—‘thee, large and great with side-spent force,’—for large he is, and directed sideways, and great with force, with smoke;—‘most ample through food, and fierce to look at,’—that is, ‘capacious with food, a consumer of food, and flaming.’

<span id="v6_3_3_2020"><sup><small>6:3:3:2020.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 24\] ‘From all sides I sprinkle the hitherward looking,’—that is, ‘from every side I offer upon the hitherward looking;’—‘with spiteless mind let him relish this,’—that is, ‘with unchafing mind may he relish this;’—‘Agni, glorious as a wooer, and of pleasing colour,’—for Agni is indeed glorious as a wooer [^430] and of pleasing colour;—‘not to be touched, while raging with his body,’—for not to be touched is he, whilst flaming with his body.

<span id="v6_3_3_2121"><sup><small>6:3:3:2121.</small></sup></span>  With two (verses) he offers; for the Sacrificer <span id="p212"><sup><small>[ p. 212 ]</small></sup></span> is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed;—with two (verses) relating to Agni: it is Agni he thereby pours forth as seed. Inasmuch as they relate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trish<i>t</i>ubhs, they are Indra; and Agni (the fire) belongs to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Moreover, Indra and Agni are all the gods, and Agni (thus) contains all deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed.

<span id="v6_3_3_2222"><sup><small>6:3:3:2222.</small></sup></span>  He offers on the horse's footprint;—the horse is the same as that Agni, and so, indeed, these two libations come to be offered over Agni.

<span id="v6_3_3_2323"><sup><small>6:3:3:2323.</small></sup></span>  He draws lines around it (the lump, with the spade): he thereby puts a measure to it (or, to him, Agni), as if saying, ‘So great thou art!’

<span id="v6_3_3_2424"><sup><small>6:3:3:2424.</small></sup></span>  And, again, why he draws a line around it;—the gods now were afraid, thinking, ‘We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!’ They drew that rampart round it; and in like manner does this one now draw that rampart round it,—with the spade, for the spade is the thunderbolt, and he thus makes the thunderbolt its (or his, Agni's) protector. He draws it all round: on every side he thus makes that thunderbolt to be its (or his) protector [^431]. Three times he draws a line: that threefold thunderbolt he thus makes to be a protector for him.

<span id="v6_3_3_2525"><sup><small>6:3:3:2525.</small></sup></span>  \[Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XI, 25-27\] ‘Around the wise lord <span id="p213"><sup><small>[ p. 213 ]</small></sup></span> of strength— [^432],’ ‘Around (us) we (place) thee, O Agni, as a rampart— [^433],’ ‘With the days, thou Agni— [^434],’ in thus praising Agni he makes a fence for him by means of (verses) containing the word ‘pari’ (around), for all round, as it were, (run) the ramparts;—(he does so by verses) relating to Agni: a stronghold of fire he thus makes for him, and this stronghold of fire keeps blazing;—(he does so) by three (verses): a threefold stronghold he thus makes for him; and hence that threefold stronghold is the highest form of strongholds. Each following (circular) line he makes wider, and with a larger metre: hence each following line of strongholds is wider, for strongholds (ramparts) are lines.

<span id="v6_3_3_2626"><sup><small>6:3:3:2626.</small></sup></span>  He then digs for him (Agni) [^435] in this earth. For the gods then were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite him here [^432]! For the sake of protection they made this earth to be a self (body, âtman) for him, thinking, ‘His own self will protect his own self.’ It (the lump of clay) should be as large as the hole: thus this earth (or clay) becomes his (Agni's) self. And as to its (being) as large as the hole,—this earth is the womb, and this (clay) is teed; and whatever part of the seed <span id="p214"><sup><small>[ p. 214 ]</small></sup></span> exceeds the womb, becomes useless; and what is deficient, is unsuccessful; but that part of the seed which is within the hole is successful. Four-cornered is this hole, for there are four quarters: from all the (four) quarters he thus digs him.

## Footnotes

[^394]: 190:1 That is, the ‘invincible’ brick, being the first brick which is made, and that by the Sacrificer's chief wife (mahishî) herself. See VI, 5, 3, seq.—Sâya<i>n</i>a remarks,—tâm âhuti<i>m</i> hutvâ imâm p<i>ri</i>thivîm âdhîya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ikîm ash<i>t</i>adhâvihitâm m<i>ri</i>tsikatâbhi<i>h</i> p<i>ri</i>thivyavairiya<i>m</i> (? p<i>ri</i>thivyaṅgair imâm) ash<i>t</i>avihitâtmikâm ashâ<i>dh</i>âm ish<i>t</i>akâm p. 191 apa<i>s</i>yat; puraiva lokâpavarga kala (? kâle or kâlât) s<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>â<i>m</i> satîm. Though in the cosmogonic account, [VI, 1, 1, 13](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_13) seq., the earth is rather said to consist of nine different elements, the ‘invincible’ brick is commonly identified with the earth. See [VI, 5, 3, 1](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_3_1). For the (eightfold) compositions of the clay used for the fire-pan and bricks, see [VI, 5, 1, 1](Book_3_6_5#v6_5_1_1) seq.

[^395]: 191:1 That is to say, the offering-spoon is filled by eight dippings with the dipping-spoon.

[^396]: 191:2 That is, by means of its constituent elements;—p<i>ri</i>thivîm ûrdhvâ<i>m</i> rûpair m<i>ri</i>dâdibhir udgamayati, Sây.

[^397]: 192:1 See [VI, 1, 1, 9](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_9).

[^398]: 192:2 [VI, 1, 1, 10](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_10).—The construction of the text is somewhat peculiar,—what the author means to say seems to be,—the threefold science (the Veda) with which Pra<i>g</i>âpati entered the waters is the same as the prayers now offered up.

[^399]: 194:1 See III, 5, 3, 12, where ‘b<i>ri</i>hat vipa<i>s</i><i>k</i>it’ (in the same formula) is explained as referring to the sacrifice.

[^400]: 196:1 Or, the single oblations, as distinguished from the whole continued libation.

[^401]: 196:2 Dîptyâ virâ<i>g</i>amâna<i>h</i>, Sây.

[^402]: 197:1 That is to say, it shows itself openly, appears fearlessly before others of its kind;—Svâya rûpâyeti tâdarthye <i>k</i>aturthî; âvi<i>h</i> prakâ<i>s</i>o bhavati, tadanukâre<i>n</i>edânîm api pa<i>s</i>u<i>h</i> svâya rûpâya samâna<i>g</i>âtîyâyâ prakâ<i>s</i>o bhavati, Sây.

[^403]: 197:2 That is to say, they saw that one animal might do for two,—pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>amî pratinidhau, Sây. (Pâ<i>n</i>. II, 3, 11.)

[^404]: 197:3 Viz. the she-ass and the mare.

[^405]: 197:4 Anaddhâ-purusham alîka-purusham purushât pratyapa<i>s</i>yan purushasthâne kalitavantas, Sây. Thus probably a counterfeit of a man, a doll or human effigy.

[^406]: 198:1 That is, in order that this item of the sacrificial performance should correspond with the nature of Agni. The number of five is obtained by the three beasts actually led forward,—a horse, an ass, and a he-goat—and the two beasts for which the ass was stated to be a substitute, viz. the cow (or bullock) and the sheep.—Sâya<i>n</i>a, whose comment is very corrupt in this place, remarks,—nânaddhâpurushoऽtra ga<i>n</i>yate.

[^407]: 198:2 In the text the dative of purpose (‘ahi<i>m</i>sâyai’) is as usual shifted right to the end of the train of reasoning explaining the _raison d’être_ of this item of the performance.

[^408]: 198:3 This final clause with ‘vai’ supplies the reason why Agni entered the womb, viz. because otherwise he could not be born;—just as the preceding clause with ‘vai’ (the womb does not injure the child) supplies the reason why reed grass is used; whilst the preceding clauses explain how the reed comes to be the womb whence Agni sprung.

[^409]: 199:1 See [VI, 1, 1, 11](Book_3_6_1#v6_1_1_11).

[^410]: 199:2 Dakshi<i>n</i>ato vai v<i>ri</i>shâ yoshâm upa<i>s</i>ete;—compare: uttarato hi strî pumâ<i>m</i>sam upa<i>s</i>ete, I, 1, 1, 20; II, 5, 2, 17.

[^411]: 200:1 For the construction, see [p. 198](#p198), note [^407].

[^412]: 200:2 Prâde<i>s</i>amâtra<i>m</i> hîda<i>m</i> mukham abhi vâg vadati, mukham abhi var<i>n</i>âtmikâ vâg vadati vâktâstis (?) tasyâ<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a prâde<i>s</i>amâtratvam adhyâtmâvadhâritam atoऽtrâpi prâde<i>s</i>amâtrâ . . . yuktâ, Sây.

[^413]: 200:3 According to Sâya<i>n</i>a the tip of the tongue is indicated (as [VII, 2, 3, 3](Book_3_7_2#v7_2_3_3); [2, 4, 14](Book_3_7_2#v7_2_4_14), ‘vâ<i>k</i>’ means ‘mouth’); but perhaps it is rather sharp, vituperative speech addressed to another person that is intended here.

[^414]: 200:4 Sâya<i>n</i>a identifies the divine speech with Sa<i>m</i>sk<i>ri</i>t, and the human speech with the Apabhra<i>m</i><i>s</i>as, or low dialects (? mânusha<i>m</i> <i>k</i>âpâtro<i>s</i>am, MS.).

[^415]: 201:1 Mahîdhara says, Agni is called ‘purîshya,’ because loose soil (purîsha) is put in the fire-pan (ukhâ), on which the fire is then placed. It also doubtless refers to the loose soil which is spread over the different layers of the altar, thus serving as mortar to the bricks. In this epithet of Agni, ‘purîsha’ seems, however, to be taken in yet another, more subtle sense, the author apparently connecting with it its etymological meaning of ‘that which fills, fillings, Germ. Füllung, Füllsel;’ whilst the reference to cattle might also seem to point to the later ordinary meaning, ‘faeces, manure.’ Mahîdhara, on the force of the symbolical identification ‘pa<i>s</i>avo vai purîsham,’ seems straightway to take ‘purîsha’ as a synonym of ‘pa<i>s</i>u,’ when he says,—purîshebhya<i>h</i> pa<i>s</i>ubhyo hita<i>h</i> purîshya<i>h</i>. Sâya<i>n</i>a's comment here is corrupt,—pa<i>s</i>avo vai purîsha<i>m</i> pûra<i>n</i>âmûhi(?) kârya<i>m</i> pa<i>s</i>ava<i>h</i> pûrayanti.

[^416]: 204:1 Pratûrtam, ‘sped forward, speeding forward.’

[^417]: 204:2 Asmayu, ‘tending towards us, favourable to us,’ is explained differently by the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a.

[^418]: 204:3 The author here, as elsewhere, rather takes ‘vâ<i>g</i>a’ in the sense of ‘strength, sustenance.’

[^419]: 205:1 The text here has the ordinary Sanskrit construction, running literally thus:—he does not touch—Agni (being) the same as the animals—‘lest he, Agni, should injure me!’

[^420]: 206:1 The lump of clay which is to be used for the making of the fire-pan has been placed in a square hole east of the Âhavanîya fire.

[^421]: 206:2 That is to say, he looks at the lump of clay through the hollow part of the ant-hill, whilst muttering the formula given in the next paragraph.

[^422]: 208:1 Or, as if one were to say,—yathâyam iha-sthâna âstha(?) iti ka<i>s</i><i>k</i>id brûyâd eva<i>m</i> proktavân, Sây.

[^423]: 208:2 Or, by covering;—it is not easy to see what the author makes of ‘v<i>ri</i>ttvâya,’ for which the St. Petersburg dictionary suggests ‘v<i>ri</i>tvâya.’ Mahîdhara derives it from ‘vart,’ in the sense of ‘to touch.’ Perhaps, however, ‘bhûmer’ depends on ‘yatas;’ hence ‘moving about, tell us from what spot of the ground we may dig him out.’
