## FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v9_5_1_11"><sup><small>9:5:1:11.</small></sup></span>  Now, then, as to the taking of milk as fast-food: the initiated should take milk for his fast-food. Once upon a time the nectar of immortality departed from the gods.

<span id="v9_5_1_22"><sup><small>9:5:1:22.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘Let us seek for it here by toil and penance!’ They sought for it by toil and penance. Having become initiated, they were living on fast-milk, for penance it is when, after becoming initiated, one lives on fast-milk. They heard the sound of it.

<span id="v9_5_1_33"><sup><small>9:5:1:33.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!’ They resorted to three teats: they saw it.

<span id="v9_5_1_44"><sup><small>9:5:1:44.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!’ They resorted to two teats: they saw it still nearer.

<span id="v9_5_1_55"><sup><small>9:5:1:55.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!’ They resorted to one teat: it came nigh unto them, but they could not lay hold of it.

<span id="v9_5_1_66"><sup><small>9:5:1:66.</small></sup></span>  They said, ‘It has indeed come nigh unto us, but we cannot lay hold of it: let us undergo the whole (practice of) penance!’ On the day of preparation they underwent entire abstention from food; for the whole (practice of) penance it is when one abstains from food: let him therefore eat nothing on the day of preparation.

<span id="v9_5_1_77"><sup><small>9:5:1:77.</small></sup></span>  On the morrow, having laid hold of it and pressed it (the Soma), they offered (of it) in the fire, <span id="p256">[<sup><small>p. 256</small></sup>]</span> and thereby bestowed immortality upon Agni. And he, Agni (the fire-altar), indeed, is the body of all the gods; and hence, when they bestowed immortality on Agni (the fire-altar), they bestowed immortality on their own selves, and thereby the gods became immortal.

<span id="v9_5_1_88"><sup><small>9:5:1:88.</small></sup></span>  Now that same nectar of immortality is Soma. And even to this day the Sacrificer seeks for it by toil and penance; having become initiated he lives on fast-milk; for penance it is when, after being initiated, one lives on fast-milk; he hears the sound of it, saying, ‘On such and such a day the buying (will take place [^448])!’

<span id="v9_5_1_99"><sup><small>9:5:1:99.</small></sup></span>  He resorts to three teats (of the cow): he sees it. He resorts to two teats: he sees it nearer by. He resorts to one teat: it comes nigh to him, but he cannot lay hold of it. He undergoes entire abstinence from food; for the whole (practice of) penance it is when one abstains from food: let him therefore eat nothing on the day of preparation.

<span id="v9_5_1_1010"><sup><small>9:5:1:1010.</small></sup></span>  And, on the morrow, having laid hold of it, and pressed it, he offers (of it) in the fire, and thereby bestows immortality on Agni. He then drinks (of it), and thereby bestows immortality on his own self, and becomes immortal; for this, assuredly, is immortality to man when he attains the whole (perfect) life: and so, in truth, he attains the whole life by this self of his.

<span id="v9_5_1_1111"><sup><small>9:5:1:1111.</small></sup></span>  When he has offered in the fire, he drinks (Soma); for that (fire-altar) is his divine body, and this (Sacrificer's own body) is his human one; and <span id="p257">[<sup><small>p. 257</small></sup>]</span> the gods were first, and then men: therefore he drinks (Soma), after offering in the fire.

<span id="v9_5_1_1212"><sup><small>9:5:1:1212.</small></sup></span>  Now, then, the discussion of the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us (oblations): The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, entered upon their father Pra<i>g</i>âpati's inheritance, to wit, speech—truth and untruth, both truth and untruth: they, both of them, spake the truth, and they both spake untruth; and, indeed, speaking alike, they were alike.

<span id="v9_5_1_1313"><sup><small>9:5:1:1313.</small></sup></span>  The gods relinquished untruth, and held fast to truth, and the Asuras relinquished truth, and held fast to untruth.

<span id="v9_5_1_1414"><sup><small>9:5:1:1414.</small></sup></span>  The truth which was in the Asuras beheld this, and said, ‘Verily, the gods have relinquished untruth, and held fast to truth: well, then, I will go thither!’ Thus it went over to the gods.

<span id="v9_5_1_1515"><sup><small>9:5:1:1515.</small></sup></span>  And the untruth which was in the gods beheld this, and said, ‘Verily, the Asuras have relinquished truth, and held fast to untruth: well, then, I will go thither!’ Thus it went over to the Asuras.

<span id="v9_5_1_1616"><sup><small>9:5:1:1616.</small></sup></span>  The gods spake nothing but truth, and the Asuras nothing but untruth. And the gods, speaking the truth diligently, were very contemptible, and very poor: whence he who speaks the truth diligently, becomes indeed very contemptible, and very poor; but in the end he assuredly prospers, for the gods indeed prospered.

<span id="v9_5_1_1717"><sup><small>9:5:1:1717.</small></sup></span>  And the Asuras, speaking untruth diligently, throve even as salt soil [^449], and were very prosperous: whence he who speaks untruth diligently, thrives indeed, even as salt soil, and becomes very prosperous; <span id="p258">[<sup><small>p. 258</small></sup>]</span> but in the end he assuredly comes to naught, for the Asuras indeed came to naught.

<span id="v9_5_1_1818"><sup><small>9:5:1:1818.</small></sup></span>  Now that same truth, indeed, is this threefold lore [^450]. The gods said, ‘Now that we have made up the sacrifice, let us spread out [^451] this truth!’

<span id="v9_5_1_1919"><sup><small>9:5:1:1919.</small></sup></span>  They prepared the Initiation-offering. But the Asuras became aware of it, and said, ‘Having made up the sacrifice, the gods are now spreading out that truth: come, let us fetch hither what was ours!’ The Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us of that (offering) was not yet performed, when they arrived: whence people offer no Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us [^452] for that sacrifice. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else [^453]. They (the Asuras) went away again, thinking, ‘It is something else they are doing.’

<span id="v9_5_1_2020"><sup><small>9:5:1:2020.</small></sup></span>  When they had gone away, they (the gods) prepared the Opening-offering. But the Asuras <span id="p259">[<sup><small>p. 259</small></sup>]</span> became aware of this also. The <i>S</i>amyos (formula) of that (offering) had been pronounced, when they arrived; whence that sacrifice ends with the <i>S</i>amyos [^454]. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, ‘It is something else they are doing.’

<span id="v9_5_1_2121"><sup><small>9:5:1:2121.</small></sup></span>  When they had gone away, they (the gods), having bought and driven about the king (Soma), prepared the guest-offering for him. But the Asuras became aware of this also. The I<i>d</i>â of that (offering) had been invoked, when they arrived; whence that sacrifice ends with the I<i>d</i>â [^455]. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, ‘It is something else they are doing.’

<span id="v9_5_1_2222"><sup><small>9:5:1:2222.</small></sup></span>  When they had gone away, they (the gods) spread out (performed) the Upasads [^456]. When they had recited three kindling-verses, and no more, they made offering to the deities, but laid out [^457] no fore-offerings and no after-offerings on either side of the sacrifice, for they were in too great haste at that time; whence at the Upasads, when he has recited three kindling-verses, and no more, he <span id="p260">[<sup><small>p. 260</small></sup>]</span> makes offering to the deities, but lays out no fore-offerings and no after-offerings on either side of the sacrifice.

<span id="v9_5_1_2323"><sup><small>9:5:1:2323.</small></sup></span>  On the day of preparation they slaughtered the Agnîshomîya victim. But the Asuras became aware of this also. The Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us oblations of this (offering) had not yet been offered, when they arrived; whence people offer no Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us for this animal(-offering). The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, ‘It is something else they are doing.’

<span id="v9_5_1_2424"><sup><small>9:5:1:2424.</small></sup></span>  On the next morning after they had gone away, they (the gods) spread out (performed) the morning-service (of the Soma-sacrifice). But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much as the morning-service had been performed of it, when they arrived. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, ‘It is something else they are doing.’

<span id="v9_5_1_2525"><sup><small>9:5:1:2525.</small></sup></span>  When they had gone, they (the gods) spread out the midday-service. But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much as the midday-service had been performed of it, when they arrived. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, ‘It is something else they are doing.’

<span id="v9_5_1_2626"><sup><small>9:5:1:2626.</small></sup></span>  When they had gone, (the gods) went on with the animal-offering of the Soma-sacrifice [^458]. <span id="p261">[<sup><small>p. 261</small></sup>]</span> But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much of this animal-offering as is done (at the evening-service) had been done, when they arrived. The gods, espying them, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, ‘It is something else they are doing.’

<span id="v9_5_1_2727"><sup><small>9:5:1:2727.</small></sup></span>  When they had gone away, they (the gods) spread the evening-service and completed it; and by completing it they obtained that whole truth. Then the Asuras went down [^459]. Then the gods prevailed, and the Asuras came to naught. And, indeed, he who knows this, himself prevails, and his spiteful enemy comes to naught.

<span id="v9_5_1_2828"><sup><small>9:5:1:2828.</small></sup></span>  The gods said, ‘Those sacrifices of ours which are half-completed, and leaving behind which we went off [^460],—think ye upon this, how we may complete them!’ They said, ‘Meditate ye!’ whereby, indeed, they meant to say, ‘Seek ye how we may complete these sacrifices!’

<span id="v9_5_1_2929"><sup><small>9:5:1:2929.</small></sup></span>  Whilst meditating, they saw these Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us (oblations), and offered them, and thereby completed those sacrifices; and inasmuch as thereby they completed (sa<i>m</i>sthâpaya) them, they are ‘sa<i>m</i>sthitaya<i>g</i>us’; and inasmuch as thereby they sacrificed completely (sa<i>m</i>\-ya<i>g</i> [^461]), they are ‘samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us.’

<span id="v9_5_1_3030"><sup><small>9:5:1:3030.</small></sup></span>  Now there are nine such (incomplete) sacrifices, <span id="p262">[<sup><small>p. 262</small></sup>]</span> and there are nine samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us-oblations [^462]; and by offering these, he completes those sacrifices. He offers both kinds, those of the Soma-sacrifice, and those of the Agni(-<i>k</i>ayana),—first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and afterwards those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained.

<span id="v9_5_1_3131"><sup><small>9:5:1:3131.</small></sup></span>  Two he offers of the fire-altar,—two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus completes the sacrifice. \[He offers them, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 56, 57\], ‘Sacrifice hath been offered, up by the Bh<i>ri</i>gus . . .;’—‘May Agni who hath received sacrifice and oblation speed our offered meat!’

<span id="v9_5_1_3232"><sup><small>9:5:1:3232.</small></sup></span>  These two amount to eleven,—the Trish<i>t</i>ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh means strength: it is strength he thus imparts to the Sacrificer.

<span id="v9_5_1_3333"><sup><small>9:5:1:3333.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why there are eleven,—the Trish<i>t</i>ubh consists of eleven syllables, and Indra is of trish<i>t</i>ubh nature, Indra is the self (soul) of the sacrifice, Indra is the deity [^463]: he thus finally establishes the sacrifice in him who is the self, the deity of the sacrifice.

<span id="v9_5_1_3434"><sup><small>9:5:1:3434.</small></sup></span>  Having performed the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us-oblations, they betake themselves to the expiatory bath (avabh<i>ri</i>tha [^464]). Having come out from the bath, <span id="p263">[<sup><small>p. 263</small></sup>]</span> and performed the Udayanîya (concluding oblation) [^465], he, after the animal cake of the offering of the barren cow [^466], prepares oblations for the goddesses.

<span id="v9_5_1_3535"><sup><small>9:5:1:3535.</small></sup></span>  For now Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having gained his end, thought himself quite perfect. Establishing himself in the quarters he went on ordering (or creating) and disposing everything here; and inasmuch as he went on ordering and disposing, he is the Orderer. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, establishing himself in the quarters, order and dispose everything here.

<span id="v9_5_1_3636"><sup><small>9:5:1:3636.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he prepares these oblations. This Agni (the fire-altar) is the quarters (regions), and these he lays down beforehand (in the shape of) the bunch of Darbha grass [^467] and the clod-bricks [^468]; the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts [^469] in the first layer, the whole of the second, the whole of the third, and the whole of the fourth (layers [^470]); and of the fifth <span id="p264">[<sup><small>p. 264</small></sup>]</span> layer the Asapatnâs, Nâkasads and Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs [^471],—these kept going out upwards [^472] (from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the altar). Pra<i>g</i>âpati was afraid of them, thinking, ‘Whilst moving away, these will go beyond this universe.’ Having become the Orderer, he went round them and established himself in them.

<span id="v9_5_1_3737"><sup><small>9:5:1:3737.</small></sup></span>  Now the same as that Orderer is yonder sun; and that which was the farthest gone of the regions is that in which that (sun) shines firmly established.

<span id="v9_5_1_3838"><sup><small>9:5:1:3838.</small></sup></span>  And the same as that Orderer is this cake to the Orderer on twelve potsherds. On twelve potsherds (it is),—the year is (of) twelve months, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the Orderer. And that one which was the farthest gone of the regions is the same as these previous oblations,—a pap to Anumati, a pap to Râkâ, a pap to Sinîvalî, and a pap to Kuhû [^473]: when he prepares these oblations, he thereby establishes him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) in that which was the farthest gone of the regions. That (cake) he offers whole, for the completeness of that (Pra<i>g</i>âpati).

<span id="v9_5_1_3939"><sup><small>9:5:1:3939.</small></sup></span>  These are goddesses, for they are the regions, <span id="p265">[<sup><small>p. 265</small></sup>]</span> the regions are the metres, and the metres are deities; and that Ka is Pra<i>g</i>âpati; and inasmuch as they are goddesses (devî) and Ka, they are ‘devikâ<i>h</i> [^474].’ There are five of them, for there are five regions.

<span id="v9_5_1_4040"><sup><small>9:5:1:4040.</small></sup></span>  As to this they say, ‘He should not offer these oblations, lest he should do what is excessive.’ Let him nevertheless offer them; for these oblations are offered for (the fulfilment) of (special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatever oblation is offered after the cake of the animal-offering that is placed inside the victim itself as its sacrificial sap. He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the Agni(-<i>k</i>ayana), to wit, first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. The cake-offering of the animal sacrifice is (performed) in a loud voice, and these (five oblations) in a low voice, for they are an ish<i>t</i>i [^475]. With the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a he (the Adhvaryu) says, ‘Recite!—Urge!’ and with these (oblations), ‘Recite!—Worship!’ for they are an ish<i>t</i>i [^476]. There is the same Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, and the same I<i>d</i>â [^477].

<span id="v9_5_1_4141"><sup><small>9:5:1:4141.</small></sup></span>  Of that same animal-offering (of the barren cow) they perform the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us-oblations; they enter the expiatory bath with the heart-spit [^478]; <span id="p266">[<sup><small>p. 266</small></sup>]</span> for this animal-offering is the end. Having proceeded with the heart-spit;—

<span id="v9_5_1_4242"><sup><small>9:5:1:4242.</small></sup></span>  And having returned (to the fire-altar), he performs the oblations to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman;—This Agni(-<i>k</i>ayana) indeed (includes) all sacrificial rites (vi<i>s</i>vâni karmâ<i>n</i>i); and all these its rites have been performed in this (agni<i>k</i>ayana): he now gratifies them, and makes them a deity by means of an offering of sacrificial food; for only that one is a deity, for whom an oblation is prepared, but not one for whom it is not (prepared). Moreover, this Agni is Vi<i>s</i>vakarman (the all-worker): it is him he thereby gratifies.

<span id="v9_5_1_4343"><sup><small>9:5:1:4343.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he offers the Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (oblations) [^479]. For the fire-altar there is both a beginning and an end: the Sâvitra [^480] (formulas) are the beginning, and the Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (oblations) the end. Were he to offer only those to Savit<i>ri</i>, and not those to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman, it would be as if he made only a beginning and no end; and were he to offer only those to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman, and not those to Savit<i>ri</i>, it would be as if he made only an end and no beginning. He offers both of them, and thus makes both a beginning and an end.

<span id="v9_5_1_4444"><sup><small>9:5:1:4444.</small></sup></span>  There are eight of those (Sâvitra), and so (there are eight of) these: thus he makes the end

<span id="p267">[<sup><small>p. 267</small></sup>]</span>

(the same) as the beginning. The Svâhâ-call is the ninth of those [^481], and so it is of these: thus he makes the end as the beginning. The oblation (âhuti) is the tenth of those [^482], and so it is of these: thus he makes the end as the beginning. On that occasion he offers the oblation continuously so as not to stop the seed, the sacrifice there being seed;—on this occasion (he offers) with the dipping-spoon at the Svâhâ-call, for manifest is the seed when it is born.

<span id="v9_5_1_4545"><sup><small>9:5:1:4545.</small></sup></span>  \[He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVII, 58-65\], ‘What hath flowed from out of the will, or the heart, or was gathered from the mind, or the eye, after that go ye forward,—to the world of the righteous whither the first-born seers went of old!’ he thereby means those <i>Ri</i>shis [^483].

<span id="v9_5_1_4646"><sup><small>9:5:1:4646.</small></sup></span>  ‘Unto thee, O (heavenly) seat, I commit this treasure which the knower of beings shall bring thither [^484]! Here the lord of the sacrifice will go after you: acknowledge ye [^485] him in the highest heaven!’—as the text, so the meaning.

<span id="v9_5_1_4747"><sup><small>9:5:1:4747.</small></sup></span>  ‘Acknowledge him, O ye gods, seated <span id="p268">[<sup><small>p. 268</small></sup>]</span> in the highest heaven, know ye his form! When he cometh by the godward paths, reveal ye unto him the fulfilment of his wishes!’—as the text, so the meaning.—‘Awake, O Agni, and be watchful! . . .’—‘Whereby thou carriest a thousand, . . .’—the meaning of these two has been explained [^486].

<span id="v9_5_1_4848"><sup><small>9:5:1:4848.</small></sup></span>  ‘With grass-bunch and enclosing-stick, with spoon, altar-ground and grass-cover, with verse of praise, lead thou this our sacrifice unto heaven, to go unto the gods!’ that is, ‘with these outward forms of our sacrifice make it go to the heavenly world!’

<span id="v9_5_1_4949"><sup><small>9:5:1:4949.</small></sup></span>  ‘What gift, what bounty, what fulfilment, what offering-presents there are of ours,—Agni Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a shall deposit them in heaven with the gods!’—that is, ‘whatever we give, seasonably or unseasonably, that this fire-altar of Vi<i>s</i>vakarman shall place in the heavenly world!’

<span id="v9_5_1_5050"><sup><small>9:5:1:5050.</small></sup></span>  ‘Where the streams of honey and ghee are never-failing,—there, in heaven, Agni Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a shall place us with the gods!’—as the text, so the meaning [^487].

<span id="v9_5_1_5151"><sup><small>9:5:1:5151.</small></sup></span>  Eight Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (oblations) he offers,—the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great <span id="p269">[<sup><small>p. 269</small></sup>]</span> as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span id="v9_5_1_5252"><sup><small>9:5:1:5252.</small></sup></span>  When he has performed the Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (oblations), he gives a name [^488] (to the fire of the altar); for when any one has been born sound and safe, they give a name to him, and now this (Agni) has indeed been born sound and safe.

<span id="v9_5_1_5353"><sup><small>9:5:1:5353.</small></sup></span>  Having given a name to him, he reverently approaches him; for this (Sacrificer) builds him with his (own) whole self, and were he not to give utterance now to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) would now take away his (the Sacrificer's) self; but when he now gives utterance to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) does not take away his self. \[He approaches the fire\] with the Anush<i>t</i>ubh verse (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 67), ‘What fires of the five races of men there are upon this earth,—thou art the chiefest of them: quicken us unto life!’—the Anush<i>t</i>ubh, doubtless, is speech, and all the metres are speech [^489]: he thus makes amends to him (Agni) by all the metres. Having stood by the fire, and lifted [^490] it, and churned it out, he offers the completing oblation [^491]. <span id="p270">[<sup><small>p. 270</small></sup>]</span> 9:5:1:5454\. He then offers a dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a [^492]. Now he who performs this (Agni-<i>k</i>ayana) rite comes to be with the gods; and these two, Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, are a divine pair. Now, were he to have intercourse with a human woman without having offered this (oblation), it would be a descent, as if one who is divine would become human; but when he offers this dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, he thereby approaches a divine mate [^493]: having offered it, he may freely have intercourse in a befitting way.

<span id="v9_5_1_5555"><sup><small>9:5:1:5555.</small></sup></span>  And, again, as to why he offers this dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was released, the seed fell from him. When the gods restored him, they, by means of this dish of clotted curds, put seed into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put seed into him.

<span id="v9_5_1_5656"><sup><small>9:5:1:5656.</small></sup></span>  Now that Pra<i>g</i>âpati who became released is this very fire-altar which is here being built; and the seed which fell from him is this dish of clotted curds of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a; for Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a are the in-breathing and up-breathing, and the in-breathing and up-breathing fashion the infused seed. A dish of clotted curds it is, because seed is milk; and sacrifice it is, because sacrifice is the seed of sacrifice. In a low voice it is (offered), for silently seed is shed. At the end (of the sacrifice) it is (offered), for from the end seed is introduced. <span id="p271">[<sup><small>p. 271</small></sup>]</span> 9:5:1:5757\. They proceed with the whey [^494] of that (dish of clotted curds). At this (oblation of whey) he gives a dakshi<i>n</i>â (sacrificial gift): ‘Let him give a pair of hornless he-goats,’ so (they say);—‘Only by assignment, I think [^495]:’ said Mâhitthi. And, verily, this libation of the fire-builder flows away as a libation of Soma which one offers on a (fire) without bricks.

<span id="v9_5_1_5858"><sup><small>9:5:1:5858.</small></sup></span>  He need only lay down the naturally-perforated (bricks) [^496]; for the naturally-perforated ones are these worlds; and this built fire-altar is the same as these worlds.

<span id="v9_5_1_5959"><sup><small>9:5:1:5959.</small></sup></span>  He need only lay down the seasonal (bricks); for the seasonal ones are the year, and this built fire-altar is the year.

<span id="v9_5_1_6060"><sup><small>9:5:1:6060.</small></sup></span>  He need only lay down the all-light (bricks); for the all-light (bricks) are those deities [^497], and this built fire-altar is those deities.

<span id="v9_5_1_6161"><sup><small>9:5:1:6161.</small></sup></span>  He need only lay down the Puna<i>s</i><i>k</i>iti; for this is a repeated sacrifice (punar-ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a), it is a later (higher) worship of the gods: it is thus a repeated sacrifice and the higher worship of the gods he thereby arranges, and the repeated sacrifice inclines to him [^498]!—so (they say), but let him not do this, <span id="p272">[<sup><small>p. 272</small></sup>]</span> for, indeed, whenever Agni is placed on the built (altar), this whole Agni passes into that very brick [^499]: thus whenever he offers in the fire, then these oblations of his will be offered even as would be his oblations, when offered on a complete <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.

<span id="v9_5_1_6262"><sup><small>9:5:1:6262.</small></sup></span>  And, indeed, he who carries about Agni [^500] becomes pregnant with all beings, and with all the gods; and he who builds him when he has not been carried about for a year kills all beings in the form of an embryo. But, surely, he who kills a human embryo, is despised, how much more then he who kills him (Agni), for he is a god: ‘Let no one become an officiating priest for an (Agni) who has not been carried about for a year,’ said Vâtsya, 'lest he should be a participator in the killing of this, a god's seed [^501]!' <span id="p273">[<sup><small>p. 273</small></sup>]</span> 9:5:1:6363\. ‘A six-month (Agni) is the last [^502] he may build,’ they say, ‘for six-month embryos are the last [^502] that live when born.’ If he were to recite the Great Litany on one not carried for a year, he should recite (only) the eighties of verses, for something incomplete is (the Agni) not carried for a year, and something incomplete are the eighties of verses [^503]. But, indeed, he would only still further pull asunder that (Agni, already) pulled asunder [^504]; and, indeed, whether he (Agni) be carried for a year, or not carried for a year, he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) should recite the whole of the Great Litany.

<span id="v9_5_1_6464"><sup><small>9:5:1:6464.</small></sup></span>  Now <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilyâyana was once upon a time sojourning in the eastern region. Daiyâmpâti said to him, ‘<i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilyâyana, how is Agni to be built? For, indeed, we are loth to carry him for a year, and yet we wish to build him.’

<span id="v9_5_1_6565"><sup><small>9:5:1:6565.</small></sup></span>  He said, ‘Let him by all means build him by whom he has previously been carried for a year; for that, that (Agni) alone He builds as one that has been carried [^505] (as a child in the womb).’

<span id="v9_5_1_6666"><sup><small>9:5:1:6666.</small></sup></span>  And, indeed, let him by all means build who <span id="p274">[<sup><small>p. 274</small></sup>]</span> intends to press Soma for a year, for he, manifestly, supports him by food (in the shape of) those libations.

<span id="v9_5_1_6767"><sup><small>9:5:1:6767.</small></sup></span>  And, indeed, let him by all means build who offers the Agnihotra for a year, for he who offers the Agnihotra indeed supports him (Agni, the fire).

<span id="v9_5_1_6868"><sup><small>9:5:1:6868.</small></sup></span>  And, indeed, let him by all means build who was born a year (after conception); for Agni is the breath; it is thus him (Agni) he holds. And, indeed, as the breath, he enters into the infused seed, and takes possession of it; and inasmuch as he takes possession (vid) of every one that is born (<i>g</i>âta), he is <i>G</i>âtavedas. Wherefore by all means let even one who knows this build him as one ever carried (within him). And, indeed, if one who knows this either drinks (Soma), or offers drink to any one else, these libations of his will be offered even as would be his libations, when offered on a complete <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.


<span id="v9_5_2"><sup><small>9:5:2</small></sup></span>

## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A.

<span id="v9_5_2_11"><sup><small>9:5:2:11.</small></sup></span>  Indra saw this seven-versed (hymn, suitable) for making good what is deficient [^506], for reducing what is redundant, and for perfecting what is imperfect. And, indeed, after building the fire-altar, one is (still) apt to get into trouble, or to stumble, or what not. Now, when <i>S</i>yâpar<i>n</i>a Sâyakâyana heard this, he ventured upon this performance.

<span id="v9_5_2_22"><sup><small>9:5:2:22.</small></sup></span>  Now, there is here a perfecting of three things,—the perfecting of the fire-altar, the perfecting of <span id="p275">[<sup><small>p. 275</small></sup>]</span> him who has it built for him, and the perfecting of him who builds it.

<span id="v9_5_2_33"><sup><small>9:5:2:33.</small></sup></span>  Thus, when he reverently stands by (the altar) with this (hymn), everything is thereby made good [^507] for him that, knowing or unknowing, he either does in excess, or does not carry to the end, in this building of the altar—in short, whatever was not secured for him. And whatever wish there is in that anush<i>t</i>ubh verse [^508], that he secures even now; and, moreover, he thereby keeps off the fiends, the Rakshas, from this sacred work, and they do not wreck him, whilst uttering imprecations. Wherefore one who knows this may readily build a fire-altar even for an enemy, for he is able to gain the better of him.

<span id="v9_5_2_44"><sup><small>9:5:2:44.</small></sup></span>  \[^509], with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 68-74\], ‘For mighty strength that smiteth V<i>ri</i>tra, and for victory in battle, we call thee hither, O Indra!’ ‘O much-invoked Indra, crush thou the handless Ku<i>n</i>âru, lurking here, together with the Dânus; and with might smite thou the footless V<i>ri</i>tra, the ever-growing mocker!’ thus he reverently stands by (the fire) with the first two (verses) relating to the slaying of V<i>ri</i>tra. For now the gods, having warded off V<i>ri</i>tra, evil, performed this rite freed from evil; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having warded off V<i>ri</i>tra, evil, now perform this rite freed from evil. <span id="p276">[<sup><small>p. 276</small></sup>]</span> 9:5:2:55\. 'Scatter thou our scorners, O Indra [^510]!‘Like a terrible, creeping beast, dwelling in the mountains, hast thou come from the farthest distance: having sharpened thy pointed, piercing thunderbolt [^511], O Indra, beat thou off the foes, and scatter the spurners!’ thus with the second two (verses) relating to (Indra) Vim<i>ri</i>dh [^512]. For now the gods, having warded off the spurners, evil, performed this rite freed from evil; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having warded off the spurners, evil, now perform this rite freed from evil.

<span id="v9_5_2_66"><sup><small>9:5:2:66.</small></sup></span>  ‘May Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara come forward from afar to our help, to hear our hymns of praise!’—‘Sought after in the sky, sought after on earth, Agni, sought after, hath entered all the plants: Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, sought after, may guard us from injury by day and by night!’ thus with the third two (verses) relating to (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara. For now the gods, having, by Vai<i>s</i>vânara, burnt out evil, performed this rite, freed from evil; and in like manner does the . Sacrificer now, by Vai<i>s</i>vânara, burn out evil, and perform this rite freed from evil.

<span id="v9_5_2_77"><sup><small>9:5:2:77.</small></sup></span>  ‘May we obtain this wish, O Agni, with thy help! may we obtain, O wealthy one, wealth with abundant heroes! striving for strength, may we obtain strength; may we obtain undecaying glory, O thou ever-young!’ thus with one (verse) containing wishes. For now <span id="p277">[<sup><small>p. 277</small></sup>]</span> the gods, having, by the six-versed (hymn), warded off evil, made once for all, by the one wish-holding (verse), all (objects of) wishes their own; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having, by the six-versed (hymn), warded off evil, make once for all, by the one wish-holding (verse), all wishes his own.

<span id="v9_5_2_88"><sup><small>9:5:2:88.</small></sup></span>  It is (a hymn) of seven verses,—the fire-altar consists of seven layers, (and there are) seven seasons, seven regions, seven worlds of the gods, seven stomas, seven p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a (sâmans), seven metres, seven domestic animals, seven wild ones, seven vital airs in the head, and whatever else there is of seven kinds, relating to deities and relating to the self,—all that he thereby secures. They become equal to the Anush<i>t</i>ubh [^513], for the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech, and it is by speech that he secures for him (Agni) all that which is not yet secured for him.

<span id="v9_5_2_99"><sup><small>9:5:2:99.</small></sup></span>  ‘Let him approach (the fire-altar) with an eight-versed (hymn)!’ say some;—‘with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 75), “We thereby offer unto thee thy wish, reverently approaching thee with open hands: with holiest mind and peaceful thought offer thou sacrifice unto the gods as priest, O Agni!” thus with a second wish-holding one,—and the seven foregoing ones, that makes eight,—the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus secures for him <span id="p278">[<sup><small>p. 278</small></sup>]</span> whatsoever is not yet secured for him; and thus, moreover, the two deities [^514] receive the same (amount) for their share.’ Let him, however, not do so, for surely those seven (verses) are (equal to) eight anush<i>t</i>ubh (verses), and thus he even therein obtains whatever wished-for object there is in the eight-versed (hymn).

<span id="v9_5_2_1010"><sup><small>9:5:2:1010.</small></sup></span>  With (verses) addressed to Indra and Agni he approaches (the fire);—the fire-altar belongs to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus gains for him whatever has not been gained for him. And Indra and Agni are all the gods, and the fire-altar belongs to (or Agni is) all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus gains for him whatever has not been gained for him.

<span id="v9_5_2_1111"><sup><small>9:5:2:1111.</small></sup></span>  Now some make this (hymn) the opening rite of every performance, saying, ‘Freed from evil, we must perform this sacred work!’ And others, indeed, say, ‘Let him approach reverently (each) layer when it is covered with soil, for therein that (layer) becomes whole and complete.’ Let him, then, do as he chooses. So much as to the building; now as to the non-building.

<span id="v9_5_2_1212"><sup><small>9:5:2:1212.</small></sup></span>  Verily, there are three oceans,—the Fire-altar (being the ocean) of Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas, the Mahâvrata (-sâman) [^515] that of Sâmans (hymn-tunes), and the Mahad uktham (Great Litany [^516]) that of <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (verses). Whoever performs these (three rites) for another <span id="p279">[<sup><small>p. 279</small></sup>]</span> person causes these oceans to dry up for himself, and after them, thus drying up, the metres [^517] dry up for him; and after the metres the world; and after the world his own self; and after his own self his children and cattle: indeed, he who performs these for another person becomes poorer day after day.

<span id="v9_5_2_1313"><sup><small>9:5:2:1313.</small></sup></span>  And he who, not having performed these (rites) for another person, were to officiate in the performance even of all other sacrifices, for him the metres again replenish themselves from out of those oceans, and after the metres the world, and after the world his own self, and after his own self his children and cattle: indeed, he who does not perform those rites for another person, becomes more prosperous day after day. For, indeed, these (rites) are his divine, immortal body; and he who performs them for another person, makes over to another his divine body, and a withered trunk is all that remains.

<span id="v9_5_2_1414"><sup><small>9:5:2:1414.</small></sup></span>  Now, some (say), ‘Having performed them for another person, they either perform them for themselves or cause them to be performed again: this is the atonement.’ But let him not do this, for it would be as if one were to water a withered trunk; it would rot and die: let him know that there is no atonement for such an one.

<span id="v9_5_2_1515"><sup><small>9:5:2:1515.</small></sup></span>  And <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya once upon a time said—Tura Kâvasheya once built a fire-altar for the gods at Kârotî. The gods asked him, ‘Sage, seeing that they declare the building of the fire-altar not to be conducive to heaven, why then hast thou built one?’

16\. He said, ‘What is conducive to heaven, <span id="p280">[<sup><small>p. 280</small></sup>]</span> and what is not conducive thereto? The Sacrificer is the body of the sacrifice, and the officiating priests are the limbs; and, surely, where the body is there are the limbs; and where the limbs are there is the body. And, verily, if the priests have no place in heaven, then the Sacrificer has none, for both are of the same world. But let there be no bargaining as to sacrificial fees, for by bargaining the priests are deprived of their place in heaven.’

## Footnotes

[^455]: 256:1 That is, the buying of the Soma plants, for which see part ii, p. 69 seq.

[^456]: 257:1 Both salt (V, 2, 1, 16; VII, 1, 1, 6) and saline soil (VII, 3, 1, 8) mean cattle.

[^457]: 258:1 That is, the Veda, and hence the sacrificial ritual as the sole end for which the three collections of hymn-verses (<i>ri</i><i>k</i>), hymn-tunes (sâman), and sacrificial formulas (ya<i>g</i>us) were made.

[^458]: 258:2 The verb ‘tan,’ ‘to spread,’ is the regular expression for the ‘performing’ of the sacrifice,—a figure of speech taken from the spreading out of a web, in which literal sense it has to be taken here.

[^459]: 258:3 See III, 1, 3, 6, where the injunction is given that no Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us should be performed for the Dîksha<i>n</i>îyesh<i>t</i>i, ‘lest he who has put on the garment of initiation should reach the end of the sacrifice before its completion; for the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us is the end of the sacrifice.’ It should be remembered that the initiation-offering, however essential, is merely a preliminary ceremony of the Soma-sacrifice, at the end of which latter sacrifice nine Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us oblations are offered (IV, 4, 4, 1 seq.) instead of the single one offered at the ordinary havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a. The term signifies ‘the formula (ya<i>g</i>us) of the completed offering (samish<i>t</i>a).’

[^460]: 258:4 Prof. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 429, makes this last clause part of the Asuras’ speech or  thoughts,—‘one thing they have undertaken to do, and another they are doing.’ This can hardly be right.

[^461]: 259:1 See III, 2, 3, 23, where it is stated that the Prâya<i>n</i>îya of the Soma-sacrifice is to end with the <i>S</i>amyos (or <i>S</i>amyuvâka, for which see part i, p. 254 seq.); the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as (and Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us) of the ordinary ish<i>t</i>i being thus omitted.

[^462]: 259:2 For the Âtithya, see part ii, p. 85 seq. It is shorn of the after-offerings (in addition to the Patnîsa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>as and Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us).

[^463]: 259:3 For the Upasads, see part ii, p. 204 seq.

[^464]: 259:4 That is, performed; but the verb (ut-sâdaya, ‘to set out, or in order’) is used purposely, as if laying out for display,—so as to be in keeping with the ‘spreading out’ of the sacrifice.

[^465]: 260:1 The portions from the Savanîya pa<i>s</i>u, which is slain during the morning-service, continue being cooked until the evening-service, when they are offered. See IV, 2, 5, 13; and part ii, p. 357, note.

[^466]: 261:1 Literally, leapt down (from their high station).

[^467]: 261:2 That is, which we left behind us when we went off.

[^468]: 261:3 Cf. IV, 4, 4, 6. For whatever deities this sacrifice is performed, they all are thereby ‘sacrificed-to together’ (sam-ish<i>t</i>a); and because, after all those (deities) have been ‘sacrificed-to together,’ he now offers those (libations), therefore they are called Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us. See also I, 9, 2, 26, with note thereto.

[^469]: 262:1 That is to say, the same nine Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us-oblations which are performed at the end of the Soma-sacrifice (IV, 4, 4, 1 seq.). At the end of these, however, two additional such oblations are offered on the present occasion.

[^470]: 262:2 See I, 4, 5, 4, ‘Indra is the deity of (this?) sacrifice;’ IV, 4, 2, 16, ‘Indra is the leader of the sacrifice.’ The first of the nine Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us-oblations of the Soma-sacrifice is offered to Indra.

[^471]: 262:3 See IV, 4, 5, 1 seq.

[^472]: 263:1 See IV, 5, 2, 1 seq.

[^473]: 263:2 For this offering to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, see IV, 5, 1, 5.

[^474]: 263:3 The bunch of Darbha grass is placed in the centre of the newly ploughed altar-site; see VII, 2, 3, 1 seq.

[^475]: 263:4 The four logesh<i>t</i>akâs (clods of earth), being placed at the ends of the two ‘spines,’ represent the four quarters, marking as they do the centre of the east, south, west, and north sides of the altar-site, sown with seeds of all kinds; see VII, 3, I, 13 seq. The bunch of Darbha grass, placed in the centre, would thus represent the fifth region, viz. the one above.

[^476]: 263:5 Though the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts are said to represent, not the regions, but the (channels of the) vital airs, they are placed in rows along the diagonals of the square body of the altar, thus marking, as it were, the intermediate regions; whilst the fifth set is placed in a circle round the centre. See [VIII, 1, 1, 1](Book_4_8_1#v8_1_1_1) seq.

[^477]: 263:6 The bricks of these layers are all of them supposed to be marked by their position to relate to the regions or quarters.

[^478]: 264:1 For the Asapatnâs, laid down near the ends of the spines, to drive off evil in all four quarters, see [VIII, 5, 1, 1](Book_4_8_5#v8_5_1_1); for the other two kinds of bricks, expressly identified with the regions, see [VIII, 6, 1, 1](Book_4_8_6#v8_6_1_1) seq.

[^479]: 264:2 That is, the altar was so full of regions that they escaped at the top.

[^480]: 264:3 These deities are supposed to be personifications of the four phases of the moon; whilst Prof. Weber (Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 290) would also take the Orderer (dhât<i>ri</i>)—by the Brâhma<i>n</i>a identified with the sun—to represent the moon. On Sinîvalî (identified with Vâ<i>k</i>, VI, 5, 1, 9), see also A. Kuhn, Zeitschr. f. v. Sprachf. II, p. 120; Weber, Ind. Stud. V, 230. Anumati is identified with the earth, V, 2, 3, 4.

[^481]: 265:1 This is an etymological quibble resorted to in order to account for the oblation to Pra<i>g</i>âpati as one of the oblations of the goddesses (devikâ).

[^482]: 265:2 See [p. 248](Book_4_9_4#p248), note [1](Book_4_9_4#fn426).

[^483]: 265:3 See ibid., note [2](Book_4_9_4#fn427).

[^484]: 265:4 That is, for these five oblations which are inserted between the chief oblations and the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a; as above, [IX, 4, 3, 12](Book_4_9_4#v9_4_3_12) seq.

[^485]: 265:5 For this expiatory ceremony, called the <i>S</i>ûlâvabh<i>ri</i>tha (spit-bath), p. 266 and marking the conclusion of an ordinary (nirû<i>dh</i>a) animal sacrifice—not one belonging to the Soma-sacrifice—as well as of the offering of a sterile cow, see part ii, p. 215.

[^486]: 266:1 Or, perhaps, formulas; the verses used along with the oblations being ascribed to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman. In any case, however, these oblations are offered to Agni, as the Vi<i>s</i>vakarman, or all-worker (vi<i>s</i>vakart<i>ri</i>), or (in the case of Agni = Agni<i>k</i>ayana) as including all works (or sacrificial performances).

[^487]: 266:2 See VI, 3, 1, 1 seq.; part iii, p. 290 seq.

[^488]: 267:1 See VI, 3, 1, 21.

[^489]: 267:2 The Sâvitra formulas accompany eight libations, which form, however, only one single continuous offering (âhuti) with one svâhâ-call.

[^490]: 267:3 For the seven <i>Ri</i>shis, identified with the vital airs, the first existing beings, see VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.

[^491]: 267:4 Mahîdhara (and apparently Sâya<i>n</i>a) seems to supply ‘ya<i>g</i>amânam’ to ‘etam,’ and construe thus: ‘Unto thee, O heavenly sent, I commit this (Sacrificer), which treasure <i>G</i>âtavedas shall bring thither.’

[^492]: 267:5 ‘O gods, honour ye him (the Sacrificer)!’ Mahîdhara; but perhaps the <i>Ri</i>shis are addressed in this second line. Mahîdhara takes ‘atra’ (‘here’) along with ‘parame vyoman’—‘in this highest heaven.’

[^493]: 268:1 See [VIII, 6, 3, 23](Book_4_8_6#v8_6_3_23), [24](Book_4_8_6#v8_6_3_24).

[^494]: 268:2 The meaning of the verse is, however, far from certain. The above is Mahîdhara's interpretation, except that he takes ‘yâ<i>h</i>’ to mean ‘and what (other) streams there are.’ It might, however, also mean—‘What streams of honey and ghee of ours are never-failing anywhere—Agni Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a shall deposit them in heaven with the gods!’—in which case due reward for sacrifice would be prayed for.

[^495]: 269:1 According to VI, 1, 3, 20, the newly built Agni is to be called ‘<i>K</i>itra,’ the Bright one.

[^496]: 269:2 Or, are Vâ<i>k</i>, the Veda, cf. IV, 6, 7, 1 seq.

[^497]: 269:3 Or, ‘having mounted it;’—that is to say, he heats the churning-sticks (ara<i>n</i>i) at the altar-fire, betakes himself with them to the old (Gârhapatya) fire-place; ‘churns out’ the fire, and offers on the fire thus produced.

[^498]: 269:4 The Udavasânîyâ-ish<i>t</i>i, consisting of a cake on five potsherds for Agni (or a libation of ghee taken in five ladlings for Vish<i>n</i>u), is the same as for the Soma-sacrifice, IV, 5, I, 13. But whilst there it is followed at once by the (evening) Agnihotra, or oblation of milk regularly performed twice a day; on the present occasion an additional oblation is performed.

[^499]: 270:1 The same payasyâ-oblation is performed at the Dâkshâya<i>n</i>a modification of the new and full-moon sacrifice (II, 4, 4, 10 seq.); sec also the Sânnâyya of the new-moon sacrifice (part i, p. 178, note 4) which is the same dish.

[^500]: 270:2 Or, he enters into a divine union.

[^501]: 271:1 The whey (vâ<i>g</i>ina) is offered to the (divine) Coursers, i.e. the regions or quarters; see II, 4, 4, 22-25.

[^502]: 271:2 The meaning of this passage is not quite clear to me.

[^503]: 271:3 The three Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>âs in the centre of the first, third, and fifth layers represent the three worlds. These, and the subsequent injunctions, refer to one who, subsequent to the Agni<i>k</i>ayana, wishes to perform a Soma-sacrifice, without being able to repeat the Agni<i>k</i>ayana itself. Katy. Sr. XVIII, 6, 33.

[^504]: 271:4 See VI, 3, 3, 16; 5, 3, where the three Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis bricks are said to represent Agni, Vâyu (wind), and Âditya (sun) respectively.

[^505]: 271:5 Though there is nothing in the text to show where this quotation p. 272 begins, it would seem, from Kâtyâyana's rules, that it runs from the beginning of paragraph 58,—XVIII, 6, 33. In case of inability (to perform a second) <i>k</i>ityâ, at a repeated Soma-sacrifice, (he may lay down) one or other kind of the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>âs, Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotishas, or <i>Ri</i>tavyâs; 34. The Puna<i>s</i><i>k</i>iti; 35. Or no building (at all a second time); 36. Because the (Agni) <i>K</i>itya has become the Âhavanîya.

[^506]: 272:1 That is (as would seem from Sâya<i>n</i>a's interpretation), into the Âhavanîya fire, considered as the last brick of the altar; and hence the Sacrificer's offering-fire will for ever thereafter remain for him the <i>K</i>itya Agni.

[^507]: 272:2 During the time of initiation (dîkshâ), which, if at all possible, is to last for a year, the Ukhya Agni has to be carried about by the intending Sacrificer, for at least part of each day, in the fire-pan (ukhâ), suspended in a sling from his neck; the pan-fire being afterwards transferred to the newly built Gârhapatya and thence to the great fire-altar, to serve as the <i>K</i>itya Agni, or the Âhavanîya fire. See VI, 7, I, 12 seq.

[^508]: 272:3 In the original this last clause is in the first person,, or in the _oratio directa_, from the point of view of him who is asked to officiate p. 273 as a priest, hence—Let no one become an officiating priest . . ., thinking, ‘Lest I should be a participator . . .’

[^510]: 273:1 That is to say, he must have been carried about for at least six months; and embryos less than six months old cannot live.

[^511]: 273:2 This is so for the reason that the Mahad uktham consists of more than the eighties of verses; see [IX, 3, 3, 19](Book_4_9_3#v9_3_3_19). One might feel inclined to include this whole sentence in the preceding quotation.

[^512]: 273:3 That is, already too much attenuated, by being made as large as one a year old (?).

[^513]: 273:4 Sâya<i>n</i>a remarks, that this reply does not restrict the building of the fire-altar to one who has carried the fire for a full year, but only discountenances the building in the case of one who has only carried it for a few days (?).

[^514]: 274:1 Viz. in the building of the fire-altar; literally, for the obtainment of the deficient.

[^515]: 275:1 Literally, obtained.

[^516]: 275:2 Viz. the first of the seven verses (<i>Ri</i>g-veda III, 37, 1).

[^517]: 275:3 According to Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XVII, 7, 1, this ceremony should take place on the completion of each layer, after it has been covered with loose earth; cf. [paragraph 11](Book_4_9_5#v9_5_2_11).

[^518]: 276:1 For the complete verse, see IV, 6, 4, 4.

[^519]: 276:2 Thus Mahîdhara.

[^520]: 276:3 That is, the repeller of spurners, or enemies.

[^521]: 277:1 The seven verses consist of two Gâyatrîs (twenty-four syllables each), four Trish<i>t</i>ubhs (forty-four each), and one Anush<i>t</i>ubh (thirty-two syllables). Whilst the two Gâyatrîs are sixteen syllables short of two Anush<i>t</i>ubhs, the four Trish<i>t</i>ubhs have forty-eight syllables in excess of four Anush<i>t</i>ubhs. Hence the seven verses consist of 8 × 32 syllables, or eight Anush<i>t</i>ubhs.

[^522]: 278:1 Viz. Indra and Agni, having each four verses addressed to them.

[^523]: 278:2 See [p. 282](Book_4_10_1#p282), note [5](Book_4_10_1#fn525).

[^524]: 278:3 See [p. 110](Book_4_8_6#p110), note [3](Book_4_8_6#fn202); [p. 111](Book_4_8_6#p111), note [1](Book_4_8_6#fn203).

[^525]: 279:1 That is, the Vedic texts.
