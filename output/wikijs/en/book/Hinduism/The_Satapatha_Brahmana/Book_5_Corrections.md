Page 13, paragraphs 7, 8. We have probably to translate—the gods were created on its reaching heaven,—they were created on its entering this earth.

P. 45, par. 33, lines 6, 11. Read,—in the balance.

P. 60, l. 19. Read,—Adhvaryu.

P. 76, note 3. Read,—offering of a pap to Aditi.

P. 91, par. 4, l. 4. Read,—did we, by one of a hundred Ukthyas, dispel the darkness.

P. 130, par. 9, ll. 2, 3. Read,.—'The divine thought protect thee, not man's thought!’

P. 136, par. 6, l. 2. Under him:—Harisvâmin explains ‘anu’ by ‘anvâbhakta,’ ‘participating after him,’ cf. [XIII, 5, 4, 24](../Book_5_13_5#v13_5_4_24).

P. 149, note 1. The commentary takes ‘p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>yapratish<i>th</i>ite’ in the sense of ‘established on the p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya,’—inasmuch as, in the first half of the year, he begins each month with the Abhiplava, and ends with the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya, which is the stronger (balavattara, cf. [XII, 2, 2, 16](../Book_5_12_2#v12_2_2_16)), and therefore ‘âtmapratish<i>th</i>ita.’

P. 155, note 2. The MS. of the commentary is corrupt—âṅ-pûrvasyâkriyate satari<i>n</i>âdaya<i>h</i> <i>s</i>a<i>h</i> bhadrâgamam va<i>k</i><i>kh</i>asthâne evâdhikshipayati na prade<i>s</i>ântara âvartata ity artha<i>h</i>.

P. 279, note 1, l. 3 from below. Read,—‘four-eyed’ dog.

P. 334, note 1. ‘Utsanna’ probably means ‘detached’; cf. II, 5, 2, 48.

P. 397, par. 6, l. 3. For whence, read,—and then.

PART IV.

P. 20, par. 5, l. 5. Read,—skin.

P. 25, note 1, l. 4. Read,—on the reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> range.

P. 58, par. 4, l. 5. Read,—the seventh.

P. 103, par. 11. After ‘sake,’ add,—‘The Sâkvara and Raivata sâmans for stability in the air!’ for by the Sâkvara and Raivata sâmans it is indeed established in the air.

P. 108, l. 8. Read,—Pûrva<i>k</i>itti.

P. 163, l. 3. Read,—of seven seasons.

P. 168, note 4. Delete,—According to . . . referred to.

P. 170, pars. 6-8. Read,—circumambulates.

P. 192, par. 5, l. 2. Read,—irresistible warrior.

P. 223, par. 2, l. 3. Read,—shower of wealth.

P. 295, l. 1. Instead of, then,—read, thereby.

P. 313, l. 2. Read,—nor does he exceed this universe.

P. 325, par. 14. Read,—There are these five fingers (and toes) each consisting of four parts.

P. 337, note 2. Read,—‘moving in front,’ or ‘previous performance.’

P 352, par. 23, l. 2. Read,—thousand B<i>ri</i>hatîs.

P. 389, l. 9. Perhaps we ought to translate—that (gold man), indeed, is the end, the self, of everything here (or, of this universe). Cf. J. Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. v, p. 389.

Par. 16, l. 2. Read,—they ascend to where desires have vanished.

P. 393, par. 1, l. 4. Read,—<i>G</i>ana <i>S</i>ârkarâkshya.
