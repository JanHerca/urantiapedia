## HYMN LXI. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O VARUNA and Mitra, Sūrya spreading the beauteous light of you Twain Gods ariseth.
He who beholdetb all existing creatures observetb well the zeal that is in mortals.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The holy sage, renowned afar, directeth his hymns to you, O Varuṇa and Mitra,—
He whose devotions, sapient Gods, ye favour so that ye fill, as ’twere, with power his autumns.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  From the wide earth, O Varuṇa and Mitra from the great lofty heaven, ye, Bounteous Givers, -
Have in the fields and houses set your warder-, who visit every spot and watch unceasing.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I praise the strength of Varuṇa and Mitra that strength, by mightiness, keeps both worlds asunder.
Heroless pass the months of the ungodly he who loves sacrifice makes his home enduring.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Steers, all infallible are these your people in whom no wondrous thing is seen, no worship.
Guile follows close the men who are untruthful: no secrets may be hidden from your knowledge.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I will exalt your sacrifice with homage: as priest, I, Mitra-Varuṇa, invoke you.
May these new hymns and prayers that I have fashioned delight you to the profit of the singer.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  This priestly task, Gods! Varuṇa and Mitra! hath been performed for you at sacrifices.
Convey us safely over every peril. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h62"></span>

## HYMN LXII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SURYA hath sent aloft his beams of splendour o’er all the tribes of men in countless places.
Together with the heaven he shines apparent, formed by his Makers well with power and wisdom.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So hast thou mounted up before us, Sūrya, through these our praises, with fleet dappled horses.
Declare us free from all offence to Mitra, and Varuṇa, and Aryaman, and Agni.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May holy Agni, Varuṇa, and Mitra send down their riches upon us in thousands.
May they, the Bright Ones, make our praise-song perfect, and, when we laud them, grant us all our wishes.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O undivided Heaven and Earth, preserve us, us, Lofty Ones! your nobIy-born descendants.
Let us not anger Varuṇa, nor Vāyu, nor him, the dearest Friend of mortals, Mitra.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Stretch forth your arms and let our lives be lengthened: with fatness dew the pastures of our cattle.
Ye Youthful, make us famed among the people: hear, Mitra-Varuṇa, these mine invocations.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room, for us and for our children.
May we find paths all fair and good to travel. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h63"></span>

## HYMN LXIII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  COMMON to all mankind, auspicious Sūrya, he who beholdeth all, is mounting upward;
The God, the eye of Varuṇa and Mitra, who rolled up darkness like a piece of leather.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sūrya's great ensign, restless as the billow, that urgeth men to action, is advancing:
Onward he still would roll the wheel well-rounded, which Etaśa, harnessed to the car-pole, moveth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Refulgent from the bosom of the Mornings, he in Whom singers take delight ascendeth.
This Savitar, God, is my chief joy and pleasure, who breaketh not the universal statute.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Golden, far-seeing, from the heaven he riseth: far is his goal, he hasteth on resplendent.
Men, verily, inspirited by Sūrya speed to their aims and do the work assigned them.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Where the irrunortals have prepared his pathway he flieth through the region like a falcon.
With homage and oblations will we serve you, O Mitra-Varuṇa, when the Sun hath risen.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room, for us and for our children.
May we find paths all fair and good to travel. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h64"></span>

## HYMN LXIV. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YE Twain who rule, in heaven and earth, the region, clothed be your clouds in robes of oil and fatness.
May the imperial Varuṇa, and Mitra, and high-born Aryaman accept our presents.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Kings, guards of rrtighty everlasting Order, come hitherward, ye Princes, Lords of Rivers.
Send us from heaven, O Varuṇa and Mitra, rain and sweet food, ye who pour down your bounties.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May the dear God, and Varuṇa and Mitra conduct us by the most effective pathways,
That foes may say unto Sudās our chieftain, May, we, too, joy in food with Gods to guard us.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Him who hath wrought for you this car in spirit, who makes the song rise upward and sustains it,
Bedew with fatness, Varuṇa nd Mitra ye Kings, make glad the pleasant dwelling-places.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To you this laud, O Varuṇa and Mitra is offered like bright Soma juice to Vāyu.
Favour our songs of praise, wake thought and spirit. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h65"></span>

## HYMN LXV. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH hymns I call you, when the Sun hath risen, Mitra, and Varuṇa whose thoughts are holy,
Whose Power Divine, supreme and everlasting, comes with good heed at each man's supplication.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For they are Asuras of Gods, the friendly make, both of you, our lands exceeding fruitful.
May we obtain you, Varuṇa and Mitra, wherever Heaven and Earth and days may bless us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bonds of the sinner, they bear many nooses: the wicked mortal hardly may escape them.
Varuṇa-Mitra, may your path of Order bear us o’er trouble as a boat o’er waters.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come, taste our offering, Varuṇa and Mitra: bedew our pasture wil sweet food and fatness.
Pour down in plenty here upon the people the choicest of your fair celestial water.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To you this laud, O Varuṇa and Mitra, is offered, like bright Soma juice to Vāyu.
Favour our songs of praise, wake thought and spirit. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN LXVI Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET our strong hymn of praise go forth, the laud of Mitra-Varuṇa,
With homage to that high-born Pair;
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Two exceeding wise, the Sons of Dakṣa, whom the gods ordained
For lordship, excellently great.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Such, Guardians of our homes and us, O Mitra-Varuṇa, fulfil
The thoughts of those who sing your praise.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So when the Sun hath risen to-day, may sinless Mitra, Aryaman,
Bhaga, and Savitar sendus forth.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May this our home be guarded well forward, ye Bounteous, on the way,
Who bear us safely o’er distress.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And those Self-reigning, Aditi, whose statute is inviolate,
The Kings who rule a vast domain.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Soon as the Sun hath risen, to you, to Mitra-Varuṇa, I sing,
And Aryarnan who slays the foe.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  With wealth of gold may this my song bring unmolested power and might,
And, Brahmans, gain the sacrifice.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  May we be thine, God Varuṇa, and with our princes, Mitra, thine.
Food and Heaven's light will we obtain.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Many are they who strengthen Law, Sun-eyed, with Agni for their tongue,
They who direct the three great gatherings with their thoughts, yea, all things with surpassing might.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They who have stablished year and month and then the day, night, sacrifice and holy verse,
Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryarnan, the Kings, have won dominion which none else may gain.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So at the rising of the Sun we think of you with hymns to-day,
Even as Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman deserve: ye are the charioteers of Law.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  True to Law, born in Law the strengtheners of Law, terrible, haters of the false,
In their felicity which gives the best defence may we men and our princes dwell.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Uprises, on the slope of heaven, that marvel that attracts die sight
As swift celestial Etaśa bears it away, prepared for every eye to see.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Lord of each single head, of fixt and moving things, equally through the whole expanse,
The Seven sister Bays bear Sūrya on his car, to bring us wealth and happiness.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  A hundred autumns may we see that bright Eye, God-ordained, arise
A hundred autumns may we live.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Infallible through your wisdom, come hither, resplendent Varuṇa,
And Mitra, to the Soma draught.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Come as the laws of Heaven ordain, Varuṇa, Mitra, void of guile:
Press near and drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Come, Mitra, Varuṇa, accept, Heroes, our sacrificial gift:
Drink Soma, ye who strengthen Law.

<span id="h67"></span>

## HYMN LXVII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I WITH a holy heart that brings oblation will sing forth praise to meet your car, ye Princes,
Which, Much-desired! hath wakened as your envoy. I call you hither as a son his parents.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Brightly hath Agni shone by us enkindled: the limits even of darkness were apparent.
Eastward is seen the Banner of the Morning, the Banner born to give Heaven's Daughter glory.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With hymns the deft priest is about you, Aśvins, the eloquent priest attends you now, Nāsatyas.
Come by the paths that ye are wont to travel, on car that finds the light, laden with treasure.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When, suppliant for your help, Lovers of Sweetness! I seeking wealth call you to our libation,
Hitherward let your vigorous horses bear you: drink ye with us the well-pressed Soma juices.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Bring forward, Aśvins, Gods, to its fulfilment my never-wearied prayer that asks for riches.
Vouchsafe us all high spirit in the combat, and with your powers, O Lords of Power, assist us.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Favour us in these prayers of ours, O Aśvins. May we have genial vigour, ne’er to fail us.
So may we, strong in children and descendants, go, wealthy, to the banquet that awaits you.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Lovers of Sweetness, we have brought this treasure to you as ’twere an envoy sent for friendship.
Come unto us with spirits free from anger, in homes of men enjoying our oblation.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  With one, the same, intention, ye swift movers, o’er the Seven Rivers hath your chariot travelled.
Yoked by the Gods, your strong steeds never weary while speeding forward at the pole they bear you.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Exhaustless be your bounty to our princes who with their wealth incite the gift of riches,
Who further friendship with their noble natures, combining wealth in kine with wealth in herses.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Now hear, O Youthful Twain, mine invocation: come, Aśvins, to the home where food aboundeth.

## HYMN LXVIII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  COME, radiant Aśvins, with your noble horses: accept your servant's hymns, ye Wonder-Workers:
Enjoy oblations which we bring to greet you.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The gladdening juices stand prepared before you: come quickly and partake of mine oblation.
Pass by the calling of our foe and bear us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Your chariot with a hundred aids, O Aśvins, beareth you swift as thought across the regions,
Speeding to us, O ye whose wealth is Sūrya.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  What time this stone of yours, the Gods’ adorer, upraised, sounds forth for you as Soma-presser,
Let the priest bring you, Fair Ones, through oblations.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The nourishment ye have is, truly, wondrous: ye gave thereof a quickening store to Atri,
Who being dear to you, receives your favour.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  That gift, which all may gain, ye gave Cyavāna, when he grew old, who offered you oblations,
When ye bestowed on him enduring beauty.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  What time his wicked friends abandoned Bhujyu, O Aśvins, in the middle of the ocean,
Your horse delivered him, your faithful servant.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye lent your aid to Vrka when exhausted, and listened when invoked to Śayu's calling.
Ye made the cow pour forth her milk like water, and, Aśvins, strengthened with your strength the barren.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  With his fair hymns this singer, too, extols you, waking with glad thoughts at the break of morning.

and heaven,
Bright with its fellies while its way drops fatness, food-laden, rich in coursers, man's protector.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let it approach, yoked by thewill, three-seated, extending far and wide o’er fivefold beings,
Whereon ye visit God-adoring races, bending your course whither ye will, O Aśvins.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Renowned, with noble horses, come ye hither: drink, Wondrous Pair, the cup that holds sweet juices.
Your car whereon your Spouse is wont to travel marks with its track the farthest ends of heaven.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When night was turning to the grey of morning the Maiden, Sūrya's Daughter, chose your splendour.
When with your power and might ye aid the pious he comes through heat to life by your assistance.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Chariot-borne, this car of yours invested with rays of light comes harnessed to our dwelling.
Herewith, O Aśvins, while the dawn is breaking, to this our sacrifice bring peace and blessing.

Men call on you with hymns in many places, but let not other worshippers detain you.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Bhujyu, abandoned in the midst of ocean, ye raised from out the water with your horses,
Uninjured, winged, flagging not, undaunted, with deeds of wonder saving him, O Aśvins.

Which bringeth you over the seas and rivers, yoking as’twere two well-matched shining horses.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whatever dwellings ye possess, O Aśvins, in fields of men or in the streams of heaven,
Resting upon the summit of the mountain, or bringing food to him who gives oblation,
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Delight yourselves, ye Gods, in plants and waters when Ṛṣis give them and ye find they suit You.
Enriching us with treasures in abundance ye have looked back to former generations.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Aśvins, though ye have heard them oft aforetime, regard the many prayers which Ṛṣis offer.
Come to the man even as his heart desireth: may we enjoy your most delightful favour.
