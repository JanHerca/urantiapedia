## HYMN XI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ALL sacred songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea,
The best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the very Lord of strength.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Strong in thy friendship, Indra, Lord of power and might, we have no fear.
We glorify with praises thee, the never-conquered conqueror.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The gifts of Indra from of old, his saving succours, never fail,
When to the praise-singers he gives the boon of substance rich in kine.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Crusher of forts, the young, the wise, of strength unmeasured, was he born
Sustainer of each sacred rite, Indra, the Thunderer, much-extolled.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Lord of the thunder, thou didst burst the cave of Vala rich in cows.
The Gods came pressing to thy side, and free from terror aided thee,
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I, Hero, through thy bounties am come to the flood addressing thee.
Song-lover, here the singers stand and testify to thee thereof.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The wily Śuṣṇa, Indra! thou o’erthrewest with thy wondrous powers.
The wise beheld this deed of thine: now go beyond their eulogies.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Our songs of praise have glorified Indra who ruleth by his might,
Whose precious gifts in thousands come, yea, even more abundantly.

## HYMN XII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WE choose Agni the messenger, the herald, master of all wealth,
Well skilled in this our sacrifice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With callings ever they invoke Agni, Agni, Lord of the House,
Oblation-bearer, much beloved.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bring the Gods hither, Agni, born for him who strews the sacred grass:
Thou art our herald, meet for praise.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wake up the willing Gods, since thou, Agni, performest embassage:
Sit on the sacred grass with Gods.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Agni, radiant One, to whom the holy oil is poured, burn up
Our enemies whom fiends protect.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  By Agni Agni is inflamed, Lord of the House, wise, young, who bears
The gift: the ladle is his mouth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Praise Agni in the sacrifice, the Sage whose ways are ever true,
The God who driveth grief away.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  God, Agni, be his strong defence who lord of sacrificial gifts,
Worshippeth thee the messenger.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Whoso with sacred gift would fain call Agni to the feast of Gods,
O Purifier, favour him.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Such, Agni, Purifier, bright, bring hither to our sacrifice,
To our oblation bring the Gods.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  So lauded by our newest song of praise bring opulence to us,
And food, with heroes for our sons.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  O Agni, by effulgent flame, by all invokings of the Gods,
Show pleasure in this laud of ours.

## HYMN XIII. Agni

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AGNI, well-kindled, bring the Gods for him who offers holy gifts.
Worship them, Purifier, Priest.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Son of Thyself, present, O Sage, our sacrifice to the Gods today.
Sweet to the taste, that they may feast.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Dear Narāśaṁsa, sweet of tongue, the giver of oblations, I
Invoke to this our sacrifice.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni, on thy most easy car, glorified, hither bring the Gods:
Manu appointed thee as Priest.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Strew, O ye wise, the sacred grass that drips with oil, in order due,
Where the Immortal is beheld.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thrown open be the Doors Divine, unfailing, that assist the rite,
For sacrifice this day and now.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I call the lovely Night and Dawn to seat them on the holy grass
At this our solemn sacrifice.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The two Invokers I invite, the wise, divine and sweet of tongue,
To celebrate this our sacrifice.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Iḷā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, three Goddesses who bring delight,
Be seated, peaceful, on the grass.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Tvaṣṭar I call, the earliest born, the wearer of all forms at will:
May he be ours and ours alone.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  God, Sovran of the Wood, present this our oblation to the Gods,
And let the giver be renowned.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  With Svāhā pay the sacrifice to Indra in the offerer's house:
Thither I call the Deities.

## HYMN XIV. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To drink the Soma, Agni, come, to our service and our songs.
With all these Gods; and worship them.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Kaṇvas have invoked thee; they, O Singer, sing thee songs of praise
Agni, come hither with the Gods;
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra, Vāyu, Bṛhaspati, Mitra, Agni, Pūṣan, Bhaga,
Ādityas, and the Marut host.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For you these juices are poured forth that gladden and exhilarate,
The meath-drops resting in the cup.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The sons of Kaṇva fain for help adore thee, having strewn the grass,
With offerings and all things prepared.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let the swift steeds who carry thee, thought-yoked and dropping holy oil,
Bring the Gods to the Soma draught.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Adored, the strengtheners of Law, unite them, Agni, with their Dames:
Make them drink meath, O bright of tongue.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let them, O Agni, who deserve worship and praise drink with thy tongue
The meath in solemn sacrifice.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Away, from the Sun's realm of light, the wise invoking Priest shall bring
All Gods awaking with the dawn.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  With all the Gods, with Indra, with Vāyu, and Mitra's splendours, drink,
Agni, the pleasant Soma juice.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Ordained by Manu as our Priest, thou sittest, Agni, at each rite:
Hallow thou this our sacrifice.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Harness the Red Mares to thy car, the Bays, O God, the flaming ones:
With those bring hitherward the Gods.

## HYMN XV. Ṛtu.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O INDRA drink the Soma juice with Ṛtu; let the cheering drops
Sink deep within, which settle there.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Drink from the Purifier's cup, Maruts, with Ṛtu; sanctify
The rite, for ye give precious gifts.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Neṣṭar, with thy Dame accept our sacrifice; with Ṛtu drink,
For thou art he who giveth wealth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Bring the Gods, Agni; in the three appointed places set them down:
Surround them, and with Ṛtu drink.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Drink Soma after the Ṛtus, from the Brāhmaṇa's bounty: undissolved,
O Indra, is thy friendship's bond.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Mitra, Varuṇa, ye whose ways are firm—a Power that none deceives—,
With Ṛtu ye have reached the rite.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The Soma-pressers, fain for wealth, praise the Wealth-giver in the rite,
In sacrifices praise the God.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  May the Wealth-giver grant to us riches that shall be far renowned.
These things we gain, among the Gods.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He with the Ṛtu fain would drink, Wealth-giver, from the Neṣṭar's bowl.
Haste, give your offering, and depart.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As we this fourth time, Wealth-giver, honour thee with the Ṛtus, be
A Giver bountiful to us.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Drink ye the meath, O Aśvins bright with flames, whose acts are pure, who with
Ṛtus accept the sacrifice.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  With Ṛtu, through the house-fire, thou, kind Giver, guidest sacrifice:
Worship the Gods for the pious man.

## HYMN XVI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET thy Bay Steeds bring thee, the Strong, hither to drink the Soma draught—
Those, Indra, who are bright as suns.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Here are the grains bedewed with oil: hither let the Bay Coursers bring
Indra upon his easiest car.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra at early morn we call, Indra in course of sacrifice,
Indra to drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come hither, with thy long-maned Steeds, O Indra, to he draught we pour
We call thee when the juice is shed.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Come thou to this our song of praise, to the libation poured for thee
Drink of it like a stag athirst.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Here are the drops of Soma juice expressed on sacred grass: thereof
Drink, Indra, to increase thy might.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Welcome to thee be this our hymn, reaching thy heart, most excellent:
Then drink the Soma juice expressed.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To every draught of pressed-out juice Indra, the Vṛtra-slayer, comes,
To drink the Soma for delight.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Fulfil, O Śatakratu, all our wish with horses and with kine:
With holy thoughts we sing thy praise.

## HYMN XVII. Indra-Varuṇa

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I CRAVE help from the Imperial Lords, from Indra-Varuṇa; may they
Both favour one of us like me.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Guardians of men, ye ever come with ready succour at the call
Of every singer such as I.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Sate you, according to your wish, O Indra-Varuṇa, with wealth:
Fain would we have you nearest us.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May we be sharers of the powers, sharers of the benevolence
Of you who give strength bounteously.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Indra and Varuṇa, among givers of thousands, meet for praise,
Are Powers who merit highest laud.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Through their protection may we gain great store of wealth, and heap it up
Enough and still to spare, be ours.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, on you for wealth in many a form I call:
Still keep ye us victorious.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, through our songs that seek to win you to ourselves,
Give us at once your sheltering help.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, to you may fair praise which I offer come,
Joint eulogy which ye dignify.

## HYMN XVIII. Brahmaṇaspati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O BRĀHMAṆASPATI, make him who presses Soma glorious,
Even Kakṣīvān Auśija.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The rich, the healer of disease, who giveth wealth, increaseth store,
The prompt,—may he be with us still.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Let not the foeman's curse, let not a mortal's onslaught fall on us
Preserve us, Brahmaṇaspati.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ne’er is the mortal hero harmed whom Indra, Brahmaṇaspati,
And Soma graciously inspire.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Do, thou, O Brahmaṇaspati, and Indra, Soma, Dakṣiṇā,
Preserve that mortal from distress.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  To the Assembly's wondrous Lord, to Indra's lovely Friend who gives
Wisdom, have I drawn near in prayer.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He without whom no sacrifice, e’en of the wise man, prospers; he
Stirs up the series of thoughts.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He makes the oblation prosper, he promotes the course of sacrifice:
Our voice of praise goes to the Gods.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I have seen Narāśaṁsa, him most resolute, most widely famed,
As ’twere the Household Priest of heaven.

## HYMN XIX. Agni, Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To this fair sacrifice to drink the milky draught thou art invoked:
O Agni, with the Maruts come.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  No mortal man, no God exceeds thy mental power, O Mighty one:
O Agni, with the Maruts come:
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  All Gods devoid of guile, who know the mighty region of mid-air:
O Agni, with those Maruts come.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The terrible, who sing their song, not to be overcome by might:
O Agni, with those Maruts come.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Brilliant, and awful in their form, mighty, devourers of their foes:
O Agni, with those Maruts come.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Who sit as Deities in heaven, above the sky-vault's luminous sphere:
O Agni, with those Maruts come.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Who scatter clouds about the sky, away over the billowy sea:
O Agni, with those Maruts come.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Who with their bright beams spread them forth over the ocean in their might
O Agni, with those Maruts come.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For thee, to be thine early draught, I pour the Soma-mingled meath:
O Agni, with the Maruts come.

## HYMN XX. Ṛbhus.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FOR the Celestial Race this song of praise which gives wealth lavishly
Was made by singers with their lips.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They who for Indra, with their mind, formed horses harnessed by a word,
Attained by works to sacrifice.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They for the two Nāsatyas wrought a light car moving every way:
They formed a nectar-yielding cow.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The Ṛbhus with effectual prayers, honest, with constant labour, made
Their Sire and Mother young again.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Together came your gladdening drops with Indra by the Maruts girt,
With the Ādityas, with the Kings.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The sacrificial ladle, wrought newly by the God Tvaṣṭar's hand—
Four ladles have ye made thereof.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Vouchsafe us wealth, to him who pours thrice seven libations, yea, to each
Give wealth, pleased with our eulogies.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  As ministering Priests they held, by pious acts they won themselves,
A share in sacrifice with Gods.
