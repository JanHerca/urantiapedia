## HYMN XXI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WE call on thee, O Matchless One! We seeking help, possessing nothing firm ourselves,
Call on thee wonderful in fight
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  On thee for aid in sacrifice. This youth of ours, the bold, the mighty, hath gonse forth.
We therefore, we thy friends, Indra, havie chosen thee, free-giver, as our Guardian God.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Come hither, for the drops are here, O Lord of corn-lands. Lord of horses, Lord of kine:
Drink thou the Soma, Soma's Lord!
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For we the kinless singers have drawn hither thee, O Indra, who hast numerous kin.
With all the forms thou hast, comic thou of bull-like strength, come near to drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Sitting like birds beside thy meath., mingled with milk, that gladdeneth and exalteth thee,
Indra, to thee we sing aloud.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  We speak to thee with this our reverential prayer. Why art thou pondering yet awhile?
Here are our wishes; thou art liberal, Lord of Bays: we and our hymns are present here.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For not in recent times alone, O Indra, Thunder-armed, have we obtained thine aid.
Of old we knew thy plenteous wealth.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Hero, we knew thy friendship and thy rich rewards: these, Thunderer, now we crave of thee.
O Vasu, for all wealth that cometh of the kine, sharpen our powers, fair-visored God.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Him who of old hath brought to us this and that blessing, him I magnify for you,
Even Indra, O my friends, for help
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Borne by Bay Steeds, the Lord of heroes, ruling men, for it is he who takes; delight.
May Maghavan bestow on us his worshippers hundreds of cattle and of steeds.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Hero, may we, with thee for Friend, withstand the man who pants against us in his wrath,
In fight with people rich in kine.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  May we be victors in the singer's battlesong, and meet the wicked, Much invoked!
With heroes smite the foeman and show forth our strength. O Indra, further thou our thoughts.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  O Indra, from all ancient time rivalless ever and companionless art thou:
Thou seekest comradeship in war.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou findest not the wealthy man to be thy friend: those scorn thee who are flown with wine.
What time thou thunderest and gatherest, then thou, even as a Father, art invoked.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  O Indra, let us not, like fools who waste their lives at home, with friendship such as thine
Sit idly by the poured-out juice.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Giver of kine, may we not miss thy gracious gifts: let us not rob thee of thine own.
Strip even the strong places of the foe, and bring: thy gifts can never be made vain.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Indra or blest Sarasvatī alone bestows such wealth, treasure so great, or thou,
O Citra, on the worshipper.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Citra is King, and only kinglings are the rest who dwell beside Sarasvatī.
He, like Parjanya with his rain, hath spread himself with thousand, yea, with myriad gifts.

## HYMN XXII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HITHERWARD have I called to-day, for succour, that most wondrous car
Which ye ascended, Aśvins, ye whose paths are red, swift to give Car, for Sūrya's sake.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Car ever young, much longed-for, easily invoked, soon guided, first in deeds of might,
Which waits and serves, O Sobhari, with benevolence, without a rival or a foe.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These Aśvins with our homage, these Two Omnipresent Deities
Hitherward will we bring for kind help, these who seek the dwelling of the worshipper.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  One of your chariot wheels is moving swiftly round, one speeds for you its onward course.
Like a milch-cow, O Lords of splendour, and with haste let your benevolence come to us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  That chariot of yours which hath a triple seat and reins of gold,
The famous car that traverseth the heaven and earth, thereon Nāsatyas, Aśvins, come.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye with your plough, when favouring Manu with your help, ploughed the first harvest in the sky.
As such will we exalt you, Lords of splendour, now, O Aśvins, with our prayer and praise.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Come to us, Lords of ample wealth, by paths of everlasting Law,
Whereby to high dominion ye with mighty strength raised Trksi, Trasadasyu's son.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  This Soma pressed with stones is yours, ye Heroes, Lords of plenteous wealth.
Approach to drink the Soma, come, drink in the worshipper's abode.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Aśvins, mount the chariot, mount the golden seat, ye who are Lords of plenteous wealth,
And bring to us abundant food.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The aids wherewith ye helped Paktha and Adhrigt;, and Babhru severed from his friends,—
With those, O Aśvins, come hither with speed and soon, and heal whatever is diseased.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  When we continually invoke the Aśvins, the resistless, at this time of day,
We lovers of the song, with songs.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Through these, ye Mighty Ones, come hither to my call which brings all blessings, wears all forms,—
Tlirough which, All-present Heroes, lavishest of food ye strengthened Krvi, come through these.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I speak to both of these as such, these Aśvins whom I reverence at this time of day:
With homage we entreat them both.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Ye who are Lords of splendour, ye whose paths are red, at eve, at mom, at sacrifice,
Give us not utterly as prey to mortal foe, ye Rudras, Lords of ample wealth.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For bliss I call. the blissful car, at morn the inseparable Aśvins with their car
I call, like Sobhari our sire.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Rapid as thought, and strong, and speeding to thejoy, bringing.your swiftly-coming help,
Be to us a protection even from far away Lords of great wealth, with many aids.’
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Come, Wonder-Workers, to our home, our home, O Aśvins, rich in cattle, steeds, and gold,
Chief drinkers of the Soma's juice
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Choice-worthy strength, heroic, firm and excellent, uninjured by the Rakṣas foe,
At this your coming nigh, ye Lords of ample wealth and all good things, may we obtain.

## HYMN XXIII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WORSHIP thou Jātavedas, pray to him who willingly accepts,
Whose smoke wanders at will, and none may grasp his flame.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou, all men's friend, Visvamanas, exaltest Agni with thy song,
The Giver, and his flames with which no cars contend.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whose resolute assault, to win vigour and food, deserves our praise,—
Through whose discovering power the priest obtaineth wealth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Up springs the imperishable flame, the flame of the Refulgent One
Most bright, with glowing jaws and glory in his train.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Skilled in fair sacrifice, extolled, arise in Godlike loveliness,
Shining with lofty splendour, with effulgent light.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Called straight to our oblations, come, O Agni, through our eulogies,
As thou hast been our envoy bearing up our gifts.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I call your Agni, from of old Invoking Priest of living men:
Him with this song I laud and magnify for you.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Whom, wondrous wise, they animate with solemn rites and his fair form,
Kind as a friend to men who keep the holy Law.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Him, true to Law, who perfecteth the sacrifice,. Law-loving ones!
Ye with your song have gratified in the place of prayer.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May all our sacrifices go to him the truest Aṅgiras,
Who is among mankind the most illustrious Priest.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Imperishable Agni, thine are all these high enkindled lights,
Like horses and like stallions showing forth their strength.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  So give us, Lord of Power and Might, riches combined with hero strength,
And guard us with our sons and grand. sons in our frays.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Soon as the eager Lord of men is friendly unto Manti's race,
Agni averteth from us all the demon host.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  O Hero Agni, Lord of men, on hearing this new laud of mine,
Burn down the Rākṣasas, enchanters, with thy flame.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  No mortal foe can e’er prevail by arts of magic over him
Who serveth Agni well with sacrificial gifts.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Vyaśva the sage, who sought the Bull, hath won thee, finder of good things:
As such may we enkindle thee for ample wealth.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Uśanā Kāvya stablished thee, O Agni, as Invoking Priest:
Thee, Jātavedas, Sacrificing Priest for man.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  All Deities of one accord appointed thee their messenger:
Thou, God, through hearing, hadst first claim to sacrifice.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Him may the mortal hero make his own immortal messenger.
Far-spreading, Purifier, him whose path is black.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  With lifted ladles let us call him splendid with his brilliant flame,
Men's ancient Agni, wasting not, adorable.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The man who pays the worship due to him with sacrificial gifts
Obtains both plenteous nourishment and hero fame.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  To Jātavedas Agni, chief in sacrifices, first of all
With homage goes the ladle rich with sacred gifts.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Even as Vyatya did, may we with these most high and liberal hymns
Pay worship unto Agni of the splendid flame.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Now sing, as Sthurayupa sang, with lands to him who spreadeth far,
To Agni of the home, O Ṛṣi, Vyaśva's son.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  As welcome guest of human kind, as offspring of the forest kings,
The sages worship ancient Agni for his aid.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  For men's oblations brought to him who is the mighty Lord of all,
Sit, Agni, mid our homage, on the sacred grass.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Grant us abundant. treasures, grant the opulence which many crave,
With store of heroes, progeny, and high renown.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Agni, Most Youthful of the Gods, send evermore the gift of wealth
Unto Varosusaman and to all his folk.
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  A mighty Conqueror art thou, O Agni, so disclose to us
Food in our herds of kine and gain of ample wealth.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Thou, Agni, art a glorious God: bring hither Mitra, Varuṇa,
Imperial Sovrans, holy-minded, true to Law.

## HYMN XXIV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  COMPANIONS, let us learn a prayer to Indra. whom the thunder arms,
To glorify your bold and most heroic Friend.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For thou by slaying Vṛtra art the Vṛtra-slayer, famed for might.
Thou, Hero, in rich gifts surpassest wealthy chiefs.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As such, when glorified, bring us riches of very wondrous fame,
Set in the highest rank, Wealth-giver, Lord of Bays!
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Yea, Indra, thou disclosest that preeminent dear wealth of men:
Boldly, O Bold One, glorified, bring it to us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The workers of destruction stay neither thy right hand nor thy left:
Nor hosts that press about thee, Lord of Bays, in fight.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O Thunder-armed, I come with songs to thee as to a stall with kine:
Fulfil the wish and thought of him who sings thy praise.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Chief Vṛtra-slayer, through the hymn of Visvamanas think of all,
All that concerneth us, Excellent, Mighty Guide.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  May we, O Vṛtra-slayer, O Hero, find this thy newest boon, Longed-for, and excellent, thou who art much invoked!
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Indra, Dancer, Much-invoked! as thy great power is unsurpassed,
So be thy bounty to the worshipper unchecked.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Most Mighty, most heroic One, for mighty bounty fill thee full.
Though strong, strengthen thyself to win wealth, Maghavan!
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Thunderer, never have our prayers gone forth to any God but thee:
So help us, Maghavan, with thine assistance now.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For, Dancer, verily I find none else for bounty, saving thee,
For splendid wealth and power, thou Lover of the Song.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For Indra pour ye out the drops meath blent with Soma let him drink
With bounty and with majesty will he further us.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I spake to the Bay Coursers' Lord, to him who gives ability:
Now hear the son of Asva as he praises thee.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Never was any Hero born before thee mightier than thou:
None certairdy like thee in goodness and in wealth.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  O ministering priest, pour out of the sweet juice what gladdens most:
So is the Hero praised who ever prospers us.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Indra, whom Tawny Coursers bear, praise such as thine, preeminent,
None by his power or by his goodness hath attained.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  We, seeking glory, have invoked this Master of all power and might
Who must be glorified by constant sacri fice.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Come, sing we praise to Indra, friends, the Hero who deserves the laud,
Him who with none to aid o’ercomes all tribes of men.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  To him who wins the kine, who keeps no cattle back, Celestial God,
Speak wondrous speech more sweet than butter and than meath.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Whose hero powers are measureless, whose bounty ne’er may be surpassed,
Whose liberality, like light, is over all.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  As Vyaśva did, praise Indra, praise the Strong unfluctuating Guide,
Who gives the foe's possessions to the worshipper.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Now, son of Vyaśva, praise thou him who to the tenth time still is new,
The very Wise, whom living men must glorify
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Thou knowest, Indra, Thunder-armed, how to avoid destructive powers,
As one secure from pitfalls each returning day.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  O Indra, bring that aid wherewith of old, Most Wondrous! thou didst slay
His foes for active Kutsa: send it down to us.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  So now we seek thee fresh in might, Most Wonderful in act! for gain:
For thou art he who conquers all our foes for us.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Who will set free from ruinous woe, or Ārya on the Seven Streams:
O valiant Hero, bend the Dāsa's weapon down.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  As to Varosusaman thou broughtest great riches, for their gain,
To Vyaśva's sons, Blest Lady, rich in ample wealth!
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Let Narya's sacrificial meed reach Vyaśva's Soma-bearing sons:
In hundreds and in thousands be the great reward.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  If one should ask thee, Where is he who sacrificed? Whither lookest thou?
Like Vala he hath passed away and dwelleth now on Gomati.

## HYMN XXV. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I WORSHIP you who guard this All, Gods, holiest among the Gods,
You, faithful to the Law, whose power is sanctified.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So, too, like charioteers are they, Mitra and sapient Varuṇa,
Sons high-born from of old, whose holy laws stand fast.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These Twain, possessors of all wealth, most glorious, for supremest sway
Aditi, Mighty Mother, true to Law, brought forth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Great Varuṇa and Mitra, Gods, Asuras and imperial Lords,
True to Eternal Law proclaim the high decree.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The offspring of a lofty Power, Dakṣa's Two Sons exceeding strong,
Who, Lords of flowing rain, dwell in the place of food.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye who have gathered up your gifts, celestial and terrestrial food,
Let your rain come to us fraught with the mist of heaven.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The Twain, who from the lofty sky seem to look down on herds below,
Holy, imperial Lords, are set to be revered.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They, true to Law, exceeding strong, have sat them down for savran rule:
Princes whose laws stand fast, they have obtained their sway.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Pathfinders even better than the eye, with unobstructed sight,
Even when they close their lids, observant, they perceive.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So may the Goddess Aditi, may the Nāsatyas guard us well,
The Martits guard us well,.endowed with mighty strength.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Do ye, O Bounteous Gods, protect our dwelling lace by day and night:
With you for our defenders may we go unharmed.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  May we, unharmed, serve bountiful Viṣṇu, the God who slayeth none:
Self-moving Sindhu hear and be the first to mark.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  This sure protection we elect, desirable and reaching far,
Which Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman afford.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And may the Sindhu of the floods, the Maruts, and the ASvin Pair,
Boon Indra, and boon Viṣṇu have one mind with us.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Because these warring Heroes stay the enmity of every foe,
As the fierce water-flood repels the furious ones.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Here this one God, the Lord of men, looks forth exceeding far and wide:
And we, for your advantage, keep his holy laws.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  We keep the old accustomed laws, the statutes of supremacy,
The Iong-known laws of Mitra and of Varuṇa.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He who hath measured with his ray the boundaries of heaven and earth,
And with his majesty hath filled the two worlds full,
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Sūrya hath spread his light aloft up to the region of the sky,
Like Agni all aflame when gifts are offered him.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  With him who sits afar the word is lord of food that comes from kine,
Controller of the gift of unempoisoned food.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  So unto Sūrya, Heaven, and Earth at morning and at eve I speak.
Bringing enjoyments ever rise thou up for us.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  From Uksanyayana a bay, from Harayana a white steed,
And from Susaman we obtained a hamessed car.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  These two shall bring me further gain of troops of tawny-coloured steeds,
The carriers shall they be of active men of war.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And the two sages have I gained who hold the reins and bear the whip,
And the two great strong coursers, with my newest song.

## HYMN XXVI. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I CALL your chariot to receive united praise mid princely men,
Strong Gods who pour down wealth, of never vanquished might!
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye to Varosusaman come, Nāsatyas, for this glorious rite.
With your protecting aid. Strong Gods, who pour down wealth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So with oblations we invoke you, rich in ample wealth, to-day,
When night hath passed, O ye who send us plenteous food.
O Aśvins, Heroes, let your car, famed, best to travel, come to us,
And, for his glory, mark your zealous servant's lauds.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Aśvins, who send us precious gifts, even when offended, think of him:
For ye, O Rudras, lead us safe beyond our foes.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For, Wonder-Workers, with fleet steeds ye fly completely round this All,
Stirring our thoughts, ye Lords of splendour, honey-hued.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  With all-sustaining opulence, Aśvins, come hitherward to us,
Ye rich and noble Heroes, ne’er to be o’erthrown.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To welcome this mine offering, O ye Indra-like Nāsatyas, come
As Gods of best accord this day with other Gods.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For we, like Vyaśva, lifting up our voice like oxen, call on you:
With all your loving kindness, Sages, come to us.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Ṛṣi, laud the Aśvins well. Will they not listen to thy call?
Will they not burn the Paṇis who are nearer them?
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Heroes, listen to the son of Vyaśva, and regard me here,
Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, of one accord.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Gods whom we yearn for, of your gifts, of what ye bring to us, bestow
By princes' hands on me, ye Mighty, day by day.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Him whom your sacrifices clothe, even as a woman with her robe,
The Aśvins help to glory honouring him well.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Whoso regards your care of men as succour widest in its reach,
About his dwelling go, ye Aśvins, loving us.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Come to us ye who pour down wealth, come to the home which men must guard:
Like shafts, ye are made meet for sacrifice by song.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Most fetching of all calls, the laud, as envoy, Heroes, called to you
Be it your own, O Aśvin Pair.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Be ye in yonder sea of heaven, or joying in the home of food,
Listen to me, Immortal Ones.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  This river with his lucid flow attracts you, more than all the streams,—
Even Sindhu with his path of gold.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O Aśvins, with that glorious fame come hither, through our brilliant song,
Come ye whose ways are marked with light.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Harness the steeds who draw the car, O Vasu, bring the well-fed pair.
O Vāyu, drink thou of our meath: come unto our drink-offerings.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Wonderful Vāyu, Lord of Right, thou who art Tvaṣṭar's son-in-law,
Thy saving succour we elect.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  To Tvaṣṭar's son-in-law we pray for wealth whereof he hath control:
For glory we seek vayu, men with juice effused.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  From heaven, auspicious Vāyu, come drive hither with thy noble steeds:
Come on thy mighty car with wide-extending seat.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  We call thee to the homes of men, thee wealthiest in noble food,
And liberal as a press-stone with a horse's back.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  So, glad and joyful in thine heart, do thou, God, Vāyu, first of all
Vouchsafe us water, strength, and thought.

## HYMN XXVII. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  CHEIF Priest is Agni at the laud, as stones and grass at sacrifice:
With song I seek the Maruts, Brahmaṇaspati, Gods for help much to be desired.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I sing to cattle and to Earth, to trees, to Dawns, to Night, to plants.
O all ye Vasus, ye possessors of all wealth, be ye the furtherers of our thoughts.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Forth go, with Agni, to the Gods our sacrifice of ancient use,
To the Ādityas, Varuṇa whose Law stands fast, and the all-lightening Marut troop.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Lords of all wealth, may they be strengtheners of man, destroyers of his enemies.
Lords of all wealth, do ye, with guards which none may harm, preserve our dwelling free from foes.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Come to us with one mind to-day, come to us all with one accord,
Maruts with holy song, and, Goddess Aditi, Mighty One, to our house and home.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Send us delightful things, ye Maruts, on your steeds: come ye, O Mitra, to our gifts.
Let Indra, Varuṇa, and the Ādityas sit, swift Heroes, on our sacred grass.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  We who have trimmed the grass for you, and set the banquet in array,
And pressed the Soma, call you, Varuina, like men, with sacrificial fires aflame.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Maruts, Visinu, Aśvins, Pūṣan, haste away with minds turned hitherward to Me.
Let the Strong Indra, famed as Vṛtra's slayer, come first with the winners of the spoil.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ye Guileless Gods, bestow on us a refuge strong on every side,
A sure protection, Vasus, unassailable from near at hand or from afar.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Kinship have I with you, and close alliance O ye Gods, destroyers of our foes.
Call us to our prosperity of former days, and soon to new klicity.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For now have I sent forth to you, that I may win a fair reward,
Lords of all wealth, with homage, this my song of praise. like a milch-cow that faileth not.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Excellent Savitar hath mounted up on high for you, ye sure and careful Guides.
Bipeds and quadrupeds, with several hopes and aims, and birds have settled to their tasks.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Singing their praise with God-like thought let us invoke each God for grace,
Each God to bring you help, each God to strengthen you.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For of one spirit are the Gods with mortal man, co-sharers all of gracious gifts.
May they increase our strength hereafter and to-day, providing case and ample room.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  I laud you, O ye Guileless Gods, here where we meet to render praise.
None, Varuṇa and Mitra, harins the mortal, man who honours and obeys your laws.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He makes his house endure, he gathers plenteous food who pays obedience to your will.
Born in his sons anew he spreads as Law commands, and prospers every way unharmed.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  E’en without war he gathers wealth, and goes hisway on pleasant paths,
Whom Mitra, Varuṇa and Aryaman protect, sharing the gift,of one accord.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  E’en on the plain for him ye make a sloping path, an easy way where road is none:
And far away from him the ineffectual shaft must vanish, shot at him in vain.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  If ye appoint the rite to-day, kind Rulers, when the Sun ascends,
Lords of all wealth, at sunset or at wakingtime, or be it at the noon of day,
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Or, Asuras, when ye have sheltered the worshipper who goes to sacrifice, at eve
may we, O Vasus, ye possessors of all wealth, come then into the midst of You.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  If ye to-day at sunrise, or at noon, or in the gloom of eve,
Lords of all riches, give fair treasure to the man, the wise man who hath sacrificed,
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Then we, imperial Rulers, claim of you this boon, your wide protection, as a son.
May we, Ādityas, offering holy gifts, obtain that which shall bring us greater bliss.

## HYMN XXVIII. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE Thirty Gods and Three besides, whose seat hath been the sacred grass,
From time of old have found and gained.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Agnis, with Consorts, sending boons,
To whom our Vaṣaṭ! is addressed:
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These are our guardians in the west, and northward here, and in the south,
And on the cast, with all the tribe.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Even as the Gods desire so verily shall it be. None minisheth this power of theirs,
No demon, and no mortal
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The Seven carry seven spears; seven are the splendours they possess,
And seven the glories they assume.

## HYMN XXIX Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ONE is a youth brown, active, manifold he decks the golden one with ornament.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Another, luminous, occupies the place of sacritice, Sage, among the Gods.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  One brandishes in his hand an iron knife, firm, in his seat amid the Deities.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Another holds the thunderbolt, wherewith he slays the Vṛtras, resting in his hand.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Another bears a pointed weapon: bright is he, and strong, with healing medicines.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Another, thief-like, watches well the ways, and knows the places where the treasures lie.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Another with his mighty stride hath made his three steps thither where the Gods rejoice.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Two with one Dame ride on with winged steeds, and journey forth like travellers on their way.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Two, highest, in the heavens have set their seat, worshipped with holy oil, imperial Kings.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Some, singing lauds, conceived the Sāma-hymn, great hymn whereby they caused the Sun to shine.

## HYMN XXX. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  NOT one of you, ye Gods, is small, none of you is a feeble child:
All of you, verily, are great.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thus be ye lauded, ye destroyers of the foe, ye Three-and-Thirty Deities,
The Gods of man, the Holy Ones.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As such defend and succour us, with benedictions speak to us:
Lead us not from our fathers' and from Manu's path into the distance far away.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ye Deities who stay with us, and all ye Gods of all mankind,
Give us your wide protection, give shelter for cattle and for steed.
