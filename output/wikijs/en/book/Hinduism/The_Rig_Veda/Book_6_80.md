## HYMN LXXI. Savitar.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FULL of effectual wisdom Savitar the God hath stretched out golden arms that he may bring forth life.
Young and most skilful, while he holds the region up, the Warrior sprinkles fatness over both his hands.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May we enjoy the noblest vivifying force of Savitar the God, that he may give us wealth:
For thou art mighty to produce and lull to rest the world of life that moves on two feet and on four.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Protect our habitation, Savitar, this day, with guardian aids around, auspicious, firm and true.
God of the golden tongue, keep us for newest bliss: let not the evil-wisher have us in his power.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  This Savitar the God, the golden-handed, Friend of the home, hath risen to meet the twilight.
With cheeks of brass, with pleasant tongue, the Holy, he sends the worshipper rich gifts in plenty.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Like a Director, Savitar hath extended his golden arms, exceeding fair to look on.
He hath gone up the heights of earth and heaven, and made each monster fall and cease from troubling.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Fair wealth, O Savitar, to-day, to-morrow, fair wealth produce for us each day that passes.
May we through this our song be happy gainers, God, of a fair and spacious habitation.

## HYMN LXXII. Indra-Soma.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  GREAT is this might of yours, Indra and Soma: the first high exploits were your own achievements.
Ye found the Sun ye found the light of heaven: ye killed all darkness and the Gods’ blasphemers.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye, Indra-Soma, gave her light to Morning, and led the Sun on high with all his splendour.
Ye stayed the heaven with a supporting pillar, and spread abroad apart, the Earth, the Mother.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Ye slew the flood -obstructing serpent Vṛtra, Indra and Soma: Heaven approved your exploit.
Ye urged to speed the currents of the rivers, and many seas have ye filled full with waters.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ye in the unripe udders of the milch-kine have set the ripe milk, Indra, thou, and Soma.
Ye have held fast the unimpeded whiteness within these many-coloured moving creatures.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Verily ye bestow, Indra and Soma, wealth, famed, victorious, passing to our children.
Ye have invested men, ye Mighty Beings, with manly strength that conquers in the battle.

## HYMN LXXIII. Bṛhaspati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SERVED with oblations, first-born, mountain-render, Aṅgiras' son, Bṛhaspati, the Holy,
With twice-firm path, dwelling in light, our Father, roars loudly, as a bull, to Earth and Heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Bṛhaspati, who made for such a people wide room and verge when Gods were invocated,
Slaying his enemies, breaks down their castles, quelling his foes and conquering those who hate him.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bṛhaspati in war hath won rich treasures, hath won, this God, the great stalls filled with cattle.
Striving to win waters and light, resistless, Bṛhaspati with lightning smites the foeman.

## HYMN LXXIV. Soma-Rudra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HOLD fast your Godlike sway, O Soma-Rudra: let these our sacrifices quickly reach you.
Placing in every house your seven great treasures, bring blessing to our quadrupeds and bipeds.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Soma and Rudra, chase to every quarter the sickness that hath visited our dwelling.
Drive Nirrti away into the distance, and give us excellent and happy glories.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Provide, O Soma-Rudra, for our bodies all needful medicines to heal and cure us.
Set free and draw away the sin committed which we have still inherent in our persons.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Armed with keen shafts and weapons, kind and loving, be gracious unto us, Soma and Rudra.
Release us from the noose of Varuṇa; keep us from sorrow, in your tender loving-kindness.

## HYMN LXXV. Weapons of War.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE warrior's look is like a thunderous rain-cloud's, when, armed with mail, he seeks the lap of battle.
Be thou victorious with unwounded body: so let the thickness of thy mail protect thee.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With Bow let us win kine, with Bow the battle, with Bow be victors in our hot encounters.
The Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foeman: armed with the Bow may we subdue all regions.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Close to his car, as fain to speak, She presses, holding her well-loved Friend in her embraces.
Strained on the Bow, She whispers like a woman-this Bowstring that preserves us in the combat.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These, meeting like a woman and her lover, bear, mother-like, their child upon their bosom.
May the two Bow-ends, starting swift asunder, scatter, in unison, the foes who hate us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  With many a son, father of many daughters, He clangs and clashes as he goes to battle.
Slung on the back, pouring his brood, the Quiver vanquishes all opposing bands and armies.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Upstanding in the Car the skilful Charioteer guides his strong Horses on whithersoe’er he will.
See and admire the strength of those controlling Reins which from behind declare the will of him who drives.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Horses whose hoofs rain dust are neighing loudly, yoked to the Chariots, showing forth their vigour,
With their forefeet descending on the foemen, they, never flinching, trample and destroy them.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Car-bearer is the name of his oblation, whercon are laid his Weapons and his Armour.
So let us here, each day that passes, honour the helpful Car with hearts exceeding joyful.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  In sweet association lived the fathers who gave us life, profound and strong in trouble,
Unwearied, armed with shafts and wondrous weapons, free, real heroes, conquerors of armies.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The Brahmans, and the Fathers meet for Soma-draughts, and, graciously inclined, unequalled Heaven and Earth.
Guard us trom evil, Pūṣan, guard us strengtheners of Law: let not the evil-wisher master us.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Her tooth a deer, dressed in an eagle's feathers, bound with cow-hide, launched forth, She flieth onward.
There where the heroes speed hither and thither, there may the Arrows shelter and protect us.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Avoid us thou whose flight is straight, and let our bodies be as stone.
May Soma kindly speak to us, and Aditi protect us well.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He lays his blows upon their backs, he deals his blows upon their thighs.
Thou, Whip, who urgest horses, drive sagacious horses in the fray.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  It compasses the arm with serpent windings, fending away the friction of the bowstring:
So may the Brace, well-skilled in all its duties, guard manfully the man from every quarter.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Now to the Shaft with venom smeared, tipped with deer-horn, with iron mouth,
Celestial, of Parjanya's seed, be this great adoration paid.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Loosed from the Bowstring fly away, thou Arrow, sharpened by our prayer.
Go to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one be left alive.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  There where the flights of Arrows fall like boys whose locks are yet unshorn.
Even there may Brahmaṇaspati, and Aditi protect us well, protect us well through all our days.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Thy vital parts I cover with thine Armour: with immortality King Soma clothe thee.
Varuṇa give thee what is more than ample, and in thy triumph may the Gods be joyful.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Whoso would kill us, whether he be a strange foe or one of us,
