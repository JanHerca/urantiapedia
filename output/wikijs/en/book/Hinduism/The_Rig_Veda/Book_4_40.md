## HYMN XXXI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH what help will he come to us, wonderful, ever-waxing Friend;
With what most mighty company?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  What genuine and most liberal draught will spirit thee with juice to burst
Open e’en strongly-guarded wealth?
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Do thou who art Protector of us thy friends who praise thee
With hundred aids approach us.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Like as a courser's circling wheel, so turn thee hitherward to us,
Attracted by the hymns of men.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou seekest as it were thine own stations with swift descent of powers:
I share thee even with the Sun.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  What time thy courage and his wheels together, Indra, run their course
With thee and with the Sun alike,
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  So even, Lord of Power and Might, the people call thee Maghavan,
Giver, who pauses not to think.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And verily to him who toils and presses Soma juice for thee
Thou quickly givest ample wealth.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  No, not a hundred hinderers can check thy gracious bounty's flow,
Nor thy great deeds when thou wilt act.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May thine assistance keep us safe, thy hundred and thy thousand aids:
May all thy favours strengthen us.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Do thou elect us this place for friendship and prosperity,
And great celestial opulence.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Favour us, Indra, evermore with overflowing store of wealth:
With all thy succours aid thou us.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  With new protections, Indra, like an archer, open thou for us
The stables that are filled with kine.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Our chariot, Indra, boldly moves endued with splendour, ne’er repulsed,
Winning for us both kine and steeds.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  O Sūrya, make our fame to be most excellent among the Gods,
Most lofty as the heaven on high.

<span id="h32"></span>

## HYMN XXXII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O THOU who slewest Vṛtra, come, O Indra, hither to our side,
Mighty One with thy mighty aids.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Swift and impetuous art thou, wondrous amid the well-dressed folk:
Thou doest marvels for our help.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Even with the weak thou smitest down him
who is stronger, with thy strength
The mighty, with the Friends thou hast.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Indra, we are close to thee; to thee we sing aloud our songs:
Help and defend us, even us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As such, O Caster of the Stone, come with thy succours wonderful,
Blameless, and irresistible.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  May we be friends of one like thee, O Indra, with the wealth of kine,
Comrades for lively energy.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For thou, O Indra, art alone the Lord of strength that comes from kine
So grant thou us abundant food.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  They turn thee not another way, when, lauded, Lover of the Song,
Thou wilt give wealth to those who praise.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The Gotamas have sung their song of praise to thee that thou mayst give,
Indra, for lively energy.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  We will declare thy hero deeds, what Dāsa forts thou brakest down,
Attacking them in rapturous joy.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The sages sing those manly deeds which, Indra, Lover of the Song,
Thou wroughtest when the Soma flowed.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Indra, the Gotamas who bring thee praises have grown strong by thee.
Give them renown with hero sons.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For, Indra, verily thou art the general treasure even of all .
Thee, therefore, do we invocate.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Excellent Indra, turn to us: glad thee among us with the juice
Of Somas, Soma-drinker thou.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  May praise from us who think Qn thee, O Indra, bring thee near to us.
Turn thy two Bay Steeds hitherward.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Eat of our sacrificial cake: rejoice thee in the songs we sing.
Even as a lover in his bride.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  To India for a thousand steeds well-trained and fleet of foot we pray,
And hundred jars of Soma juice.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  We make a hundred of thy kine, yea, and a thousand, hasten nigh:
So let thy bounty come to us.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  We have obtained, a gift from thee, ten water-ewers wrought of gold:
Thou, Vṛtra-slayer, givest much.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  A bounteous Giver, give us much, bring much and not a trifling gift:
Much, Indra, wilt thou fain bestow.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  O Vṛtra-slayer, thou art famed in many a place as bountiful
Hero, thy bounty let us share.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  I praise thy pair of Tawny Steeds, wise Son of him who giveth kine
Terrify not the cows with these.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Like two slight images of girls, unrobed, upon a new-wrought post,
So shine the Bay Steeds in their course.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For me the Bays are ready when I start, or start not, with the dawn, Innocuous in the ways they take.

<span id="h33"></span>

## HYMN XXXIII. Ṛbhus.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I SEND my voice as herald to the Ṛbhus; I crave the white cow for the overspreading.
Wind-sped, the Skillful Ones in rapid motion have in an instant compassed round the heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  What time the Rbus had with care and marvels done proper service to assist their Parents,
They won the friendship of the Gods; the Sages carried away the fruit of their devotion.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May they who made their Parents, who were lying like posts that moulder, young again for ever,—
May Vāja, Vibhvan, Ṛbhu, joined with Indra , protect our sacrifice, the Soma-lovers.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As for a year the Ṛbhus kept the Milch-cow, throughout a year fashioned and formed her body,
And through a year's space still sustained her brightness, through these their labours they were made immortal.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Two beakers let us make,—thus said the eldest. Let us make three,—this was the younger's sentence.
Four beakers let us make,—thus spoke the youngest. Tvaṣṭar approved this rede of yours, O Ṛbhus.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The men spake truth and even so they acted: this Godlike way of theirs the Ṛbhus followed.
And Tvaṣṭar, when he looked on the four beakers resplendent as the day, was moved with envy.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When for twelve days the Ṛbhus joyed reposing as guests of him who never may be hidden,
They made fair fertile fields, they brought the rivers. Plants spread o’er deserts, waters filled the hollows.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  May they who formed the swift car, bearing Heroes, and the Cow omniform and all-impelling,
Even may they form wealth for us,—the Ṛbhus, dexterous-handed, deft in work and gracious.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  So in their work the Gods had satisfaction, pondering it with thought and mental insight.
The Gods’ expert artificer was Vāja, Indra's Ṛbhukṣan, Varuṇa's was Vibhvan.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They who made glad with sacrifice and praises, wrought the two Bays, his docile Steeds, for Indra,—
Ṛbhus, as those who wish a friend to prosper, bestow upon us gear and growth of riches.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  This day have they set gladdening drink before you. Not without toil are Gods inclined to friendship.
Therefore do ye who are so great, O Ṛbhus, vouchsafe us treasures at this third libation.

<span id="h34"></span>

## HYMN XXXIV. Ṛbhus.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To this our sacrifice come Ṛbhu, Vibhvan, Vāja, and Indra with the gift of riches,
Because this day hath Dhiṣaṇā the Goddess set drink for you: the gladdening draughts have reached you.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Knowing your birth and rich in gathered treasure, Ṛbhus, rejoice together with the Ṛtus.
The gladdening draughts and wisdom have approached you: send ye us riches with good store of heroes.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For you was made this sacrifice, O Ṛbhus, which ye, like men, won for yourselves aforetime.
To you come all who find in you their pleasure: ye all were—even the two elder—Vājas.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now for the mortal worshipper, O Heroes, for him who served you, was the gift of riches.
Drink, Vājas, Ṛbhus! unto you is offered, to gladden you, the third and great libation.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Come to us, Heroes, Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, glorified for the sake of mighty treasure.
These draughts approach you as the day is closing, as cows, whose calves are newly-born, their stable.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Come to this sacrifice of ours, ye Children of Strength, invoked with humble adoration.
Drink of this meath, Wealth-givers, joined with Indra with whom ye are in full accord, ye Princes.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Close knit with Varuṇa drink the Soma, Indra; close-knit, Hymn-lover! with the Maruts drink it:
Close-knit with drinkers first, who drink in season; close-knit with heavenly Dames who give us treasures.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Rejoice in full accord with the Ādityas, in concord with the Parvatas, O Ṛbhus;
In full accord with Savitar, Divine One; in full accord with floods that pour forth riches.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ṛbhus, who helped their Parents and the Aśvins, who formed the Milch-cow and the pair of horses,
Made armour, set the heaven and earth asunder,—far- reaching Heroes, they have made good offspring.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Ye who have wealth in cattle and in booty, in heroes, in rich sustenance and treasure,
Such, O ye Ṛbhus, first to drink, rejoicing, give unto us and those who laud our present.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Ye were not far: we have not left you thirsting, blameless in this our sacrifice, O Ṛbhus.
Rejoice you with the Maruts and with Indra, with the Kings, Gods! that ye may give us riches.

<span id="h35"></span>

## HYMN XXXV. Ṛbhus.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Come hither, O ye Sons of Strength, ye Ṛbhus; stay not afar, ye Children of Sudhanvan.
At this libation is your gift of treasure. Let gladdening draughts approach you after Indra's.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hither is come the Ṛbhus' gift of riches; here was the drinking of the well-pressed Soma,
Since by dexterity and skill as craftsmen ye made the single chalice to be fourfold
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Ye made fourfold the chalice that wag single: ye spake these words and said, O Friend, assist us;
Then, Vājas! gained the path of life eternal, deft-handed Ṛbhus, to the Gods’ assembly.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made fourfold by your art and wisdom?
Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O Ṛbhus, of die meath of Soma.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ye with your cunning made your Parents youthful; the cup, for Gods to drink, ye formed with cunning;
With cunning, Ṛbhus, rich in treasure, fashioned the two swift Tawny Steeds who carry Indra.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Whoso pours out for you, when days are closing, the sharp libation for your joy, O Vājas,
For him, O mighty Ṛbhus, ye, rejoicing, have fashioned wealth with plenteous store of heroes.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Lord of Bay Steeds, at dawn the juice thou drankest: thine, only thine, is the noonday libation.
Now drink thou with the wealth-bestowing Ṛbhus, whom for their skill thou madest friends, O Indra.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye, whom your artist skill hath raised to Godhead have set you down above in heaven like falcons.
So give us riches, Children of Sudhanvan, O Sons of Strength; ye have become immortal.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The third libation, that bestoweth treasure, which ye have won by skill, ye dexterous-handed,—
This drink hath been effused for you, O Ṛbhus . drink it with high delight, with joy like Indra's.

<span id="h36"></span>

## HYMN XXXVI. Ṛbhus.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE car that was not made for horses or for reins, three-wheeled, worthy of lauds, rolls round the firmament.
That is the great announcement of your Deity, that, O ye Ṛbhus, ye sustain the earth and heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye Sapient Ones who made the lightly-rolling car out of your mind, by thought, the car that never errs,
You, being such, to drink of this drink-offering, you, O ye Vājas, and ye Ṛbhus, we invoke.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Vājas, Ṛbhus, reaching far, among the Gods this was your exaltation gloriously declared,
In that your aged Parents, worn with length of days, ye wrought again to youth so that they moved at will.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The chalice that wag single ye have made fourfold, and by your wisdom brought the Cow forth from the hide.
So quickly, mid the Gods, ye gained immortal life. Vājas and Ṛbhus, your great work must be extolled.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wealth from the Ṛbhus is most glorious in renown, that which the Heroes, famed for vigour, have produced.
In synods must be sung the car which Vibhvan wrought: that which ye favour, Gods! is famed among mankind.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Strong is the steed, the man a sage in eloquence, the bowman is a hero hard to beat in fight,
Great store of wealth and manly power hath he obtained whom Vāja, Vibhvan, Ṛbhus have looked kindly on.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  To you hath been assigned the fairest ornament, the hymn of praise: Vājas and Ṛbhus, joy therein;
For ye have lore and wisdom and poetic skill: as such, with this our prayer we call on you to come.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  According to the wishes of our hearts may ye, who have full knowledge of all the delights of men,
Fashion for us, O Ṛbhus, power and splendid wealth, rich in high courage, excellent, and vital strength.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Bestowing on us here riches and offspring, here fashion fame for us befitting heroes.
Vouchsafe us wealth of splendid sort, O Ṛbhus, that we may make us more renowned than others.

<span id="h37"></span>

## HYMN XXXVII. Ṛbhus.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  COME to our sacrifice, Vājas, Ṛbhukṣans, Gods, by the paths which Gods are wont to travel,
As ye, gay Gods, accept in splendid weather the sacrifice among these folk of Manus.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May these rites please you in your heart and spirit; may the drops clothed in oil this day approach you.
May the abundant juices bear you onward to power and strength, and, when imbibed, delight you.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Your threefold going near is God-appointed, so praise is given you, Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans.
So, Manus-like, mid younger folk I offer, to you who are aloft in heaven, the Soma.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Strong, with fair chains of gold and jaws of iron, ye have a splendid car and well-fed horses.
Ye Sons of Strength, ye progeny of Indra, to you the best is offered to delight you.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ṛbhukṣans! him, for handy wealth, the mightiest comrade in the fight,
Him, Indra's equal, we invoke, most bounteous ever, rich in steeds.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The mortal man whom, Ṛbhus, ye and Indra favour with your help,
Must be successful, by his thoughts, at sacrifice and with the steed.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, free for us the paths to sacrifice,
Ye Princes, lauded, that we may press forward to each point of heaven.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, ye Nāsatyas, Indra, bless this wealth,
And, before other men's, the steed, that ample riches may be won.

<span id="h38"></span>

## HYMN XXXVIII. Dadhikris.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FROM you two came the gifts in days aforetime which Trasadasyu granted to the Pūrus.
Ye gave the winner of our fields and plough-lands, and the strong smiter who subdued the Dasyus.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And ye gave mighty Dadhikrās, the giver of many gifts, who visiteth all people,
Impetuous hawk, swift and of varied colour, like a brave King whom each true man must honour.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whom, as ’twere down a precipice, swift rushing, each Pūru praises and his heart rejoices,—
Springing forth like a hero fain for battle, whirling the car and flying like the tempest.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Who gaineth precious booty in the combats and moveth, winning spoil, among the cattle;
Shown in bright colour, looking on the assemblies, beyond the churl, to worship of the living.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Loudly the folk cry after him in battles, as ’twere a thief who steals away a garment;
Speeding to glory, or a herd of cattle, even as a hungry falcon swooping downward.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And, fain to come forth first amid these armies, this way and that with rows of cars he rushes,
Gay like a bridesman, making him a garland, tossing the dust, champing the rein that holds him.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And that strong Steed, victorious and faithful, obedient with his body in the combat,
Speeding straight on amid the swiftly pressing, casts o’er his brows the dust he tosses upward.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And at his thunder, like the roar of heaven, those who attack tremble and are affrighted;
For when he fights against embattled thousands, dread is he in his striving; none may stay him.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The people praise the overpowering swiftness of this fleet Steed who giveth men abundance.
Of him they say when drawing back from battle. Dadhikrās hath sped forward with his thousands.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Dadhikrās hath o’erspread the Fivefold People with vigour, as the Sun lightens the waters.
May the strong Steed who winneth hundreds, thousands, requite with sweetness these my words and praises.

## HYMN XXXIX Dadhikrās.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now give we praise to Dadhikrās the rapid, and mention in our laud the Earth and Heaven.
May the Dawns flushing move me to exertion, and bear me safely over every trouble.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I praise the mighty Steed who fills my spirit, the Stallion Dadhikrāvan rich in bounties,
Whom, swift of foot and shining bright as Agni, ye, Varuṇa and Mitra, gave to Pūrus.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Him who hath honoured, when the flame is kindled at break of dawn, the Courser Dadhikrāvan,
Him, of one mind with Varuṇa and Mitra may Aditi make free from all transgression.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When we remember mighty Dadhikrāvan our food and strength, then the blest name of Maruts,
Varuṇa, Mitra, we invoke for welfare, and Agni, and the thunder-wielding Indra.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Both sides invoke him as they call on Indra when they stir forth and turn to sacrificing.
To us have Varuṇa and Mitra granted the Courser Dadhikrās, a guide for mortals.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So have I glorified with praise strong Dadhikrāvan, conquering Steed.
Sweet may he make our mouths; may he prolong the days we have to live.

<span id="h40"></span>

## HYMN XL. Dadhikrāvan.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET us recite the praise of Dadhikrāvan: may all the Mornings move me to exertion;
Praise of the Lord of Waters, Dawn, and Agni, Bṛhaspati Son of Aṅgiras, and Sūrya.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Brave, seeking war and booty, dwelling with the good and with the swift, may he hasten the food of Dawn.
May he the true, the fleet, the lover of the course, the bird-like Dadhikrāvan, bring food, strength, and light.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  His pinion, rapid runner, fans him m his way, as of a bird that hastens onward to its aim,
And, as it were a falcon's gliding through the air, strikes Dadhikrāvan's side as he speeds on with might.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Bound by the neck and by the flanks and by the mouth, the vigorous Courser lends new swiftness to his speed.
Drawing himself together, as his strength allows, Dadhikrās springs along the windings of the paths.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The Haṁsa homed in light, the Vasu in mid-air, the priest beside the altar, in the house the guest,
Dweller in noblest place, mid men, in truth, in sky, born of flood, kine, truth, mountain, he is holy Law.
