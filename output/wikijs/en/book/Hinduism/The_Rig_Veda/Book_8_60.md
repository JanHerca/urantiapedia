## HYMN LI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  OFFER ye up as praise to him that wherein Indra takes delight.
The Soma-bringers magnify Indra's great energy with hymns. Good are the gifts that Indra gives.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sole among chiefs, companionless, impetuous, and peerless, he
Hath waxen great o’er many folk, yea., over all things born, in might.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Lord of swift bounty, he will win e’en with a steed of worthless sort.
This, Indra, must be told of thee who wilt perform heroic deeds.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come to us hither: let us pay devotions that enhance thy might,
For which, Most Potent! thou wouldst fain bless the man here who strives for fame.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For thou, O Indra, makest yet more bold the spirit of the bold
Who with strong Soma serveth thee, still ready with his reverent prayers.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Worthy of song, he looketh down as a man looketh into wells.
Pleased with the Soma-bringer's skill he maketh him his mate and friend.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  In strength and wisdom all the Gods, Indra, have yielded unto thee.
Be thou the Guard of all, O thou whom many praise.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Praised, Indra, is this might of thine, best for the service of the Gods,
That thou with power dost slay Vṛtra, O Lord of Strength.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He makes the races of mankind like synods of the Beauteous One.
Indra knows this his manifest deed, and is renowned.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thy might, O Indra, at its birth, thee also, and thy mental power,
In thy care, Maghavan rich in kine! they have increased exceedingly.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Vṛtra-slayer, thou and I will both combine for winning spoil.
Even malignity will consent, O Bolt-armed Hero, unto us.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let us extol this Indra as truthful and never as untrue.
Dire is his death who pours no gifts great light hath he who offers them. Good are the gifts that Indra gives.

## HYMN LII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH powers of Mighty Ones hath he, Ancient, Beloved, been equipped,
Through whom the Father Manu made prayers efficacious with the Gods.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Him, Maker of the sky, let stones wet with the Soma ne’er forsake,
Nor hymns and prayer that must be said.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra who knew full well disclosed the kine to the Aṅgirases.
This his great deed must be extolled.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra, promoter of the song, the sage's Strengthener as of old,
Shall come to bless and succour us at presentation of this laud.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Now after their desire's intent the pious singers with the cry
Of Hail! have sung loud hymns to thee, Indra, to gain a stall of kine.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  With Indra rest all deeds of might, deeds done and yet to be performed,
Whom singers know devoid of guile.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When the Five Tribes with all their men to Indra have sent out their voice,
And when the priest hath strewn much grass, this is the Friend's own dwelling-place.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  This praise is verily thine own: thou hast performed these manly deeds,
And sped the wheel upon its way.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  At the o’erflowing of this Steer, boldly he strode for life, and took
Soma as cattle take their corn.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Receiving this and craving help, we, who with you are Dakṣa's sons,
Would fain exalt the Maruts’ Lord.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Yea, Hero, with the singers we sing to the duly-coming Band.
Allied with thee may we prevail.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  With us are raining Rudras, clouds accordant in call to battle, at the death of Vṛtra,

The strong assigned to him who sings and praises. May Gods with Indra at their head protect us.

## HYMN LIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY our hymns give thee great delight. Display thy bounty, Thunderer.
Drive off the enemies of prayer.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Crush with thy foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts. Mighty art thou
There is not one to equal thee.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou art the Lord of Soma pressed, Soma impressed is also thine.
Thou art the Sovran of the folk.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come, go thou forth, dwelling in heaven and listening to the prayers of men:
Thou fillest both the heavens and earth.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Even that hill with rocky heights, with hundreds, thousands, held within.
Thou for thy worshippers brakest through.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  We call on thee both night and day to taste the flowing Soma juice:
Do thou fulfil our heart's desire.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Where is that ever-youthful Steer, strong. necked and never yet bent down?
What Brahman ministers to him?
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To whose libation doth the Steer, betake him with delight therein?
Who takes delight in Indra now?
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Whom, Vṛtra-slayer, have thy gift and hero powers accompanied?
Who is thy dearest in the laud?
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For thee among mankind, among the Pūrus is this Soma shed.
Hasten thou hither: drink thereof.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  This, growing by Soma and by Śaryaṇāvān, dear to thee,
In Ārjīkīya, cheers thee best.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Hasten thou hitherward, and drink this for munificence to-day,
Delightful for thine eager draught.

## HYMN LIV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men from east and west, from north and south,
Come hither quickly with fleet steeds
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  If in the effluence of heaven, rich in its light, thou takest joy,
Or in the sea in Soma juice.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With songs I call thee, Great and Wide, even as a cow to profit us,
Indra, to drink the Soma-draught.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Hither, O Indra, let thy Bays bear up and, bring upon thy car
Thy glory, God! and majesty.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou, Indra, wouldst be sung and praised as great, strong, lordly in thy deeds
Come hither, drink our Soma juice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  We who have shed the Soma and prepared the feast are calling thee.
To sit on this our sacred grass.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As, Indra, thou art evermore the common Lord of all alike,
As such we invocate thee now.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The men with stones have milked for thee this nectar of the Soma juice:
Indra, be pleased with it, and drink.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Neglect all pious men with skill in sacred song: come hitherward,
With speed, and give us high renown.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Gods, may the mighty rest unharmed, the King who gives me spotted kine,
Kine decked with golden ornaments.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Beside a thousand spotted kine I have received a gift of gold,
Pure, brilliant, and exceeding great.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Durgaha's grandsons, giving me a thousand kine, munificent,
Have won renown among the Gods.

## HYMN LV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LOUD singing at the sacred rite where Soma flows we priests invoke
With haste, that he may help, as the bard's Cherisher, Indra who findeth wealth for you.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Whom with fair helm, in rapture of the juice, the firm resistless slayers hinder not:
Giver of glorious wealth to him who sing a his praise, honouring him who toils and pours:
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Śakra, who like a curry-comb for horses or a golden goad,
Indra, the Vṛtra-slayer, urges eagerly the opening of the stall of kine:
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Who for the worshipper scatters forth ample wealth, even though buried, piled in heaps:
May Indra, Lord of Bay Steeds, fair-helmed Thunderer, act at his pleasure, as he lists.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Hero whom many praise, what thou hast longed for, oven of old, from men.
All that we offer unto thee, O Indra, now, sacrifice, laud, effectual speech.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  To Soma, Much-invoked, Bolt-armed! for thy carouse, Celestial, Soma-drinker come.
Thou to the man who- prays and pours the juice hast been best giver of delightful wealth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Here, verily, yesterday we let the Thunder-wielder drink his fill.
So in like manner offer him the juice today. Now range you by the Glorious One.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Even the wolf, the savage beast that rends the sheep, follows the path of his decrees.
So graciously accepting, Indra, this our praise, with wondrous thought come forth to us.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  What manly deed of vigour now remains that Indra hath not done?
Who hath not heard his glorious title and his fame, the Vṛtra-slayer from his birth?
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  'How great his power resistless! how invincible the Vṛtra-slayer's matchless might!
Indra excels all usurers who see the day, excels all traffickers in strength.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, we, thy very constant worshippers,
Bring prayers ne’er heard before to thee, O Much-invoked, O Thunder-armed, to be thy meed.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  O thou of mighty acts, the aids that are in thee call forward many an eager hope.
Past the drink-offerings, Vasu, even of the good, hear my call, Strongest God, and come.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Verily, Indra, we are thine, we worshippers depend on thee.
For there is none but only thou to show us race, O Maghavan, thou much invoked.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  From this our misery and famine set us free, from this dire curse deliver us.
Succour us with thine help and with thy wondrous thought. Most Mighty, finder of the way.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Now let your Soma juice be poured; be not afraid, O Kali's sons.
This darkening sorrow goes away; yea, of itself it vanishes.

## HYMN LVI. Ādityas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now pray we to these Ksatriyas, to the Ādityas for their aid,
These who are gracious to assist.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May Mitra bear us o’er distress, and Varuṇa and Aryaman,
Yea, the Ādityas, as they know.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For wonderful and meet for praise is these Ādityas’ saving help
To him who offers and prepares.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The mighty aid of you, the Great, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,
We claim to be our sure defence.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Guard us, Ādityas, still alive, before the deadly weapon strike:
Are yc not they who hear our call?
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  What sheltering defence ye have for him who toils in pouring gifts,
Graciously bless ye us therewith.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ādityas, Gods, from sorrow there is freedom; for the sinless, wealth,
O ye in whom no fault is seen.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let not this fetter bind us fast: may he release us for success;
For strong is Indra and renowned.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Gods who fain would lend your aid, destroy not us as ye destroy
Your enemies who go astray.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And thee too, O Great Aditi, thee also, Goddess, I address,
Thee very gracious to assist.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Save us in depth and shallow from the foe, thou Mother of Strong Sons
Let no one of our seed be harmed.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Far-spread! wide-ruling! grant that we, unharmed by envy, may expand
Grant that our progeny may live.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Those who, the Princes of the folk, in native glory, ne’er deceived,
Maintain their statutes, void of guile—
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  As such, from mouth of ravening wolves, O ye Ādityas, rescue us,
Like a bound thief, O Aditi.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Ādityas, let this arrow, yea, let this malignity depart
From us or e’er it strike us dead.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  For, Bountiful Ādityas, we have evermore enjoyed your help,
Both now and in die days of old.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  To every one, O ye Most Wise, who turneth even from sin to you,
Ye Gods vouchsafe that he may live.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  May this new mercy profit us, which, ye Ādityas, frees like one,
Bound from his bonds, O Aditi.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O ye Ādityas, this your might is not to be despised by us:
So be ye graciously inclined.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Let not Vivasvān's weapon nor the shaft, Ādityas, wrought with skill,
Destroy us ere old age be nigh.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  On every side dispel all sin, Ādityas, all hostility,
Indigence, and combined attack.

## HYMN LVII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  EVEN as a car to give us aid, we draw thee hither for our bliss,
Strong in thy deeds, checking assault, Lord, Mightiest Indra, of the brave!
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Great in thy power and wisdom, Strong, with thought that comprehendeth all
Thou hast filled full with majesty.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou very Mighty One, whose hands by virtue of thy greatness grasp,
The golden bolt that breaks its way.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Your Lord of might that ne’er hath bent, that ruleth over all mankind,
I call, that he, as he is wont, may aid the chariots and the men.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whom, ever furthering, in frays that win the light, in both the hosts
Men call to succour and to help.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Indra, the Strong, the measureless, worthy of praise, Most Bountiful,
Sole Ruler even over wealth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Him, for his ample bounty, him, this Indra do I urge to drink,
Who, as his praise was sung of old, the Dancer, is the Lord of men.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou Mighty One, whose friendship none of mortals ever hath obtained
None will attain unto thy might.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Aided by thee, with thee allied, in frays for water and for sun,
Bolt-armed! may we win ample spoil.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So seek we thee with sacrifice and songs, chief Lover of the Song,
As, in our battles Indra, thou to Purumayya gavest help.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Thunderer, thou whose friendship and whose onward guidance both are sweet,
Thy sacrifice must be prepared.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  To us, ourselves, give ample room, give for our dwelling ample room
Give ample room to us to live.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  We count the banquet of the Gods a spacious pathway for the men,
And for the cattle, and the car.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Six men, yea, two and two, made glad with Soma juice, come near to me
With offerings pleasant to the taste.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Two brown-hued steeds, Indrota's gift, two bays from Rksa's son were mine,
From Asvamedha's son two red.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  From Atithigva good car-steeds; from Arksa rein-obeying steeds,
From Asvamedha beauteous ones.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Indrota, Atithigva's son, gave me six horses matched with mares
And Patakratu gave besides.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Marked above all, amid the brown, is the red mare Vṛṣanvati,
Obedient to the rein and whip.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O bound to me by deeds of might, not even the man who loves to blame.
Hath found a single fault in you.

## HYMN LVIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I SEND you forth the song of praise for Indu, hero-gladdener.
With hymn and plenty he invites you to complete the sacrifice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou wishest for thy kine a bull, for those who long for his approach,
For those who turn away from him, lord of thy cows whom none may kill.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The dappled kine who stream with milk prepare his draught of Soma juice:
Clans in the birth-place of the Gods, in the three luminous realms of heaven.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Praise, even as he is known, with song Indra the guardian of the kine,
The Son of Truth, Lord of the brave.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Hither his Bay Steeds have been sent, red Steeds are on the sacred grass,,
Where we in concert sing our songs.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For Indra Thunder-armed the kine have yielded mingled milk and meath,
What time he found them in the vault.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When I and Indra mount on high up to the Bright One's place and home,
We, having drunk of meath, will reach his seat whose Friends are three times seven.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Sing, sing ye forth your songs of praise, ye Briyamedhas, sing your songs:
Yea, let young children sing their lauds as a strong castle praise ye him.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Now loudly let the viol sound, the lute send out its voice with might,
Shrill be, the music of the string. To Indra. is the hymn up-raised.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When hither speed the dappled cows, unflinching, easy to be milked,
Seize quickly, as it bursts away, the Soma juice for Indra's drink.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Indra hath drunk, Agni hath drunk. all Deities have drunk their fill.
Here Varuṇa shall have his home, to whom the floods have sung aloud as mother-kine unto their calves.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thou, Varuṇa, to whom belong Seven Rivers, art a glorious God.
The waters flow into thy throat as ’twere a pipe with ample mouth.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He who hath made the fleet steeds spring, well-harnessed, to the worshipper,
He, the swift Guide, is that fair form that loosed the horses near at hand.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Indra, the very Mighty, holds his enemies in utter scorn.
He, far away, and yet a child, cleft the cloud smitten by his voice.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He, yet a boy exceeding small, mounted his newly-fashioned car.
He for his Mother and his Sire cooked the wild mighty buffalo.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Lord of the home, fair-helmeted, ascend thy chariot wrought of gold.
We will attend the Heavenly One, the thousand-footed, red of hue, matchless, who blesses where he goes.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  With reverence they come hitherward to him as to. a Sovran lord,
That they may bring him near for this man's good success, to prosper and bestow his gifts.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The Priyamedhas have observed the offering of the men of old,
Of ancient custom, while they strewed the sacred grass, and spread their sacrificial food.

## HYMN LIX. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HE who, as Sovran Lord of men, moves with his chariots unrestrained,
The Vṛtra-slayer vanquisher, of fighting hosts, preeminent, is praised with song.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Honour that Indra, Puruhanman! for his aid, in whose sustaining hand of old,
The splendid bolt of thunder was deposited, as the great Sun was set in heaven.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  No one by deed attains to him who works and strengthens evermore:
No, not by sacrifice, to Indra. praised o all, resistless, daring, bold in might.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The potent Conqueror, invincible in war, him at whose birth the Mighty Ones,
The Kine who spread afar, sent their loud voices out, heavens, earths seat their loud voices out,
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Indra, if a hundred heavens and if a hundred earths were thine—
No, not a thousand Suns could match thee at thy birth, not both the worlds, O Thunderer.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou, Hero, hast performed thy hero deeds with might, yea, all with strength, O Strongest One.
Maghavan, help us to a stable full of kine, O Thunderer, with wondrous aids.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let not a godless mortal gain this food, O thou whose life is long!
But one who yokes the bright-hued steeds, the Etasas, even Indra yoker of the Bays.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Urge ye the Conqueror to give, your Indra greatly to be praised,
To be invoked in shallow waters and in depths, to be invoked in deeds of might.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Vasu, O thou Hero, raise us up to ample opulence.
Raise us to gain of mighty wealth, O Maghavan, O Indra, to sublime renown.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Indra, thou justifiest us, and tramplest down thy slanderers.
Guard thyself, valiant Hero, in thy vital parts: strike down the Dāsa with thy blows.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The man who brings no sacrifice, inhuman, godless, infidel,
Him let his friend the mountain cast to rapid death, the mountain cast the Dasyu down.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  O Mightiest Indra, loving us, gather thou up, as grains of corn,
Within thine hand, of these their kine, to give away, yea, gather twice as loving us.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  O my companions, wish for power. How may we perfect Sara's praise,
The liberal princely patron, never to be harmed?
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  By many a sage whose grass is trimmed thou art continually praised,
That thou, O Sara, hast bestowed here one and here another calf.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The noble, Suradeva's son, hath brought a calf, led by the car to three of us.
As a chief brings a goat to milk.

## HYMN LX. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O AGNI, with thy mighty wealth guard us from all malignity,
Yea, from all hate of mortal man.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For over thee, O Friend from birth, the wrath of man hath no control:
Nay, Guardian of the earth art thou.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As such, with all the Gods, O Son of Strength, auspicious in thy flame.
Give us wealth bringing all things good.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Malignities stay not from wealth the mortal man whom, Agni, thou
Protectest while he offers gifts.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Sage Agni, be whom thou dost urge, in worship of the Gods, to wealth,
With thine assistance winneth kine.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Riches with many heroes thou hast for the man who offers gifts:
Lead thou us on to higher bliss.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Save us, O Jātavedas, nor abandon us to him who sins,
Unto the evil-hearted man.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Agni, let no godless man avert thy bounty as a God:
Over all treasures thou art Lord.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  So, Son of Strength, thou aidest us to what is great and excellent.
Those, Vasu! Friend! who sing thy praise.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Let our songs come anear to him beauteous and bright with piercing flame
Our offerings, with our homage, to the
Lord of wealth, to him whom many praise, for help:
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  To Agni Jātavedas, to the Son of Strength, that he may give us precious gifts,
Immortal, from of old Priest among mortal men, the most delightful in the house.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Agni, made yours by sacrifice, Agni, while holy rites advance;
Agni, the first in songs, first with the warrior steed; Agni to win the land for us.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  May Agni who is Lord of wealth vouchsafe us food for friendship sake.
Agni we ever seek for seed and progeny, the Vasu who protects our lives.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Solicit with your chants, for help, Agni the God with piercing flame,
For riches famous Agni, Purumīlha and ye men! Agni to light our dwelling well.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Agni we laud that he may keep our foes afar, Agni to give us health and strength.
Let him as Guardian be invoked in all the tribes, the lighter-up of glowing brands.
