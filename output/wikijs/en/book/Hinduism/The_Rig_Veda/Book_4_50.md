## HYMN XLI. Indra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHAT laud, O Indra-Varuṇa, with oblation, hath like the Immortal Priest obtained your favour?
Hath our effectual laud, addressed with homage, touched you, O Indra-Varuṇa, in spirit?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He who with dainty food hath won you, Indra and Varuṇa, Gods, as his allies to friendship,
Slayeth the Vṛtras and his foes in battles, and through your mighty favours is made famous.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra and Varuṇa are most liberal givers of treasure to the men who toil to serve them,
When they, as Friends inclined to friendship, honoured with dainty food, delight in flowing Soma.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra and Varuṇa, ye hurl, O Mighty, on him your strongest flashing bolt of thunder
Who treats us ill, the robber and oppressor: measure on him your overwhelming vigour.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, be ye the lovers of this my song, as steers who love the milch-Cow.
Milk may it yield us as, gone forth to pasture, the great Cow pouring out her thousand rivers.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For fertile fields, for worthy sons and grandsons, for the Sun's beauty and for steer-like vigour,
May Indra-Varuṇa with gracious favours work marvels for us in the stress of battle.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For you, as Princes, for your ancient kindness, good comrades of the man who seeks for booty,
We choose to us for the dear bond of friendship, most liberal Heroes bringing bliss like parents.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Showing their strength, these hymns for grace, Free-givers I have gone to you, devoted, as to battle.
For glory have they gone, as milk to Soma, to Indra-Varuṇa my thoughts and praises.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  To Indra and to Varuṇa, desirous of gaining wealth have these my thoughts proceeded.
They have come nigh to you as treasure-lovers, like mares, fleet-footed, eager for the glory.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May we ourselves be lords of during riches, of ample sustenance for car and hones.
So may the Twain who work with newest succours bring yoked teams hitherward to us and riches.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Come with your mighty succours, O ye Mighty; come, Indra-Varuṇa, to us in battle.
What time the flashing arrows play in combat, may we through you be winners in the contest.

## HYMN XLIL Indra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I AM the royal Ruler, mine is empire, as mine who sway all life are all Immortals.
Varuṇa's will the Gods obey and follow. I am the King of men's most lofty cover.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I am King Varuṇa. To me were given these first existing high celestial powers.
Varuṇa's will the Gods obey and follow. I am the King of men's most lofty cover.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I Varuṇa am Indra: in their greatness, these the two wide deep fairly-fashioned regions,
These the two world-halves have I, even as Tvaṣṭar knowing all beings, joined and held together.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I made to flow the moisture-shedding waters, and set the heaven firm in the scat of Order.
By Law the Son of Aditi, Law Observer, hath spread abroad the world in threefold measure.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Heroes with noble horses, fain for battle, selected warriors, call on me in combat.
I Indra Maghavan, excite the conflict; I stir the dust, Lord of surpassing vigour.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  All this I did. The Gods’ own conquering power never impedeth me whom none opposeth.
When lauds and Soma juice have made me joyful, both the unbounded regions are affrighted.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  All beings know these deeds of thine thou tellest this unto Varuṇa, thou great Disposer!
Thou art renowned as having slain the Vṛtras. Thou madest flow the floods that were obstructed.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Our fathers then were these, the Seven his, what time the son of Durgaha was captive.
For her they gained by sacrifice Trasadasyu, a demi-god, like Indra, conquering foemen.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The spouse of Purukutsa gave oblations to you, O Indra-Varuṇa, with homage.
Then unto her ye gave King Trasadasyu, the demi-god, the slayer of the foeman.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May we, possessing much, delight in riches, Gods in oblations and the kine in pasture;
And that Milch-cow who shrinks not from the milking, O Indra-Varuṇa, give to us daily.

## HYMN XLIII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHO will hear, who of those who merit worship, which of all Gods take pleasure in our homage?
On whose heart shall we lay this laud celestial, rich with fair offerings, dearest to Immortals?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Who will be gracious? Who will come most quickly of all the Gods? Who will
bring bliss most largely?
What car do they call swift with rapid coursers? That which the Daughter of the Sun elected.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So many days do ye come swiftly hither, as Indra to give help in stress of battle.
Descended from the sky, divine, strong-pinioned, by which of all your powers are ye most mighty?
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  What is the prayer that we should bring you, Aśvins, whereby ye come to us when invocated?
Whether of you confronts e’en great betrayal? Lovers of sweetness, Dasras, help and save us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In the wide space your chariot reacheth heaven, what time it turneth hither from the ocean.
Sweets from your sweet shall drop, lovers of sweetness! These have they dressed for you as dainty viands.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let Sindhu with his wave bedew your horses: in fiery glow have the red birds come hither.
Observed of all was that your rapid going, whereby ye were the Lords of Sūrya's Daughter.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Whene’er I gratified you here together, your grace was given us, O ye rich in booty.
Protect, ye Twain, the singer of your praises: to you, Nāsatyas, is my wish directed.

## HYMN XLIV. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WE will invoke this day your car, far-spreading, O Aśvins, even the gathering, of the sunlight,—
Car praised in hymns, most ample, rich in treasure, fitted with seats, the car that beareth Sūrya.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Aśvins, ye gained that glory by your Godhead, ye Sons of Heaven, by your own might and power.
Food followeth close upon your bright appearing when stately horses in your chariot draw you.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Who bringeth you to-day for help with offered oblation, or with hymns to drink the juices?
Who, for the sacrifice's ancient lover, turneth you hither, Aśvins, offering homage?
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Borne on your golden car, ye omnipresent! come to this sacrifice of ours, Nāsatyas.
Drink of the pleasant liquor of the Soma give riches to the people who adore you.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Come hitherward to us from earth, from heaven, borne on your golden chariot rolling lightly.
Suffer not other worshippers to stay you here are ye bound by earlier bonds of friendship.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now for us both, mete out, O Wonder-Workers, riches exceeding great with store of heroes,
Because the men have sent you praise, O Aśvins, and Ajamīlhas come to the laudation.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Whene’er I gratified you here together, your grace was given us, O ye rich in booty.
Protect, ye Twain, the singer of your praises: to you, Nāsatyas, is my wish directed.

## HYMN XLV. Aśvins

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YONDER goes up that light: your chariot is yoked that travels round upon the summit of this heaven.
Within this car are stored three kindred shares of food, and a skin filled with meath is rustling as the fourth.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Forth come your viands rich with store of pleasant meath, and cars and horses at the flushing of the dawn,
Stripping the covering from the surrounded gloom, and spreading through mid-air bright radiance like the Sun.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Drink of the meath with lips accustomed to the draught; harness for the meath's sake the chariot that ye love.
Refresh the way ye go, refresh the paths with meath: hither, O Aśvins, bring the skin that holds the meath.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The swans ye have are friendly, rich in store of meath, gold-pinioned, strong to draw, awake at early morn,
Swimming the flood, exultant, fain for draughts that cheer: ye come like flies to our libations of the meath.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Well knowing solemn rites and rich in meath, the fires sing to the morning Aśvins at the break of day,
When with pure hands the prudent energetic priest hath with the stones pressed out the Soma rich in meath.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The rays advancing nigh, chasing with day the gloom, spread through the firmament bright radiance like the Sun;
And the Sun harnessing his horses goeth forth: ye through your Godlike nature let his paths be known.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Devout in thought I have declared, O Aśvins, your chariot with good steeds, which lasts for ever,
Wherewith ye travel swiftly through the regions to the prompt worshipper who brings oblation.

## HYMN XLVI. Vāyu. Indra-Vāyu

Vāyu, and drink your fill of juice.

The sacrifice, that reaches heaven.

For unto you the drops proceed as waters gather to the vale.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Indra-Vāyu, mighty Twain, speeding together, Lords of Strength,
Come to our succour with your team, that ye may drink the Soma juice.

## HYMN XLIX. Indra-Bṛhaspati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  DEAR is this offering in your mouth, O Indra and Bṛhaspati:

With songs, to drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Drink, Indra and Bṛhaspati, the Soma in the giver's house:
Delight yourselves abiding there.

## HYMN L. Bṛhaspati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Him who with might hath propped earth's ends, who sitteth in threefold seat, Bṛhaspati, with thunder,
Him of the pleasant tongue have ancient sages, deep-thinking, holy singers, set before them.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Wild in their course, in well-marked wise rejoicing were they, Bṛhaspati, who pressed around us.
Preserve Bṛhaspati, the stall uninjured, this company's raining, ever-moving birthplace.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bṛhaspati, from thy remotest distance have they sat down who love the law eternal.
For thee were dug wells springing from the mountain, which murmuring round about pour streams of sweetness.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Bṛhaspati, when first he had his being from mighty splendour in supremest heaven,
Strong, with his sevenfold mouth, with noise of thunder, with his seven rays, blew and dispersed the darkness.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  With the loud-shouting band who sang his praises, with thunder, he destroyed obstructive Vala.
Bṛhaspati thundering drave forth the cattle, the lowing cows who make oblations ready.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Serve we with sacrifices, gifts, and homage even thus the Steer of all the Gods, the Father.
Bṛhaspati, may we be lords of riches, with noble progeny and store of heroes.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Surely that King by power and might heroic hath made him lord of all his foes' posses-ions,
Who cherishes Bṛhaspati well-tended, adorns and worships him as foremost sharer.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  In his own house he dwells in peace and comfort: to him for ever holy food flows richly.
To him the people with free will pay homage-the King with whom the Brahman hath precedence.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He, unopposed, is master of the riches of his own subjects and of hostile people.
The Gods uphold that King with their protection who helps the Brahman when he seeks his favour.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Indra, Bṛhaspati, rainers of treasure, rejoicing at this sacrifice drink the Soma.
Let the abundant drops sink deep within you: vouchsafe us riches with full store of heroes.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Bṛhaspati and Indra, make us prosper may this be your benevolence to us-ward.
Assist our holy thoughts, wake up our spirit: weaken the hatred of our foe and rivals.
