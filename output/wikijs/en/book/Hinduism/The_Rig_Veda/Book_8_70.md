## HYMN LXI. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  PREPARE oblation: let him come; and let the minister serve again
Who knows the ordering thereof,
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Rejoicing in his friendship, let the priest be seated over man,
Beside the shoot of active power.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Him, glowing bright beyond all thought, they seek among the race of man;
With him for tongue they seize the food.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He hath inflamed the twofold plain: life-giving, he hath climbed the wood,
And with his tongue hath struck the rock.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wandering here the radiant Calf finds none to fetter him, and seeks
The Mother to declare his praise.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And now that great and mighty team, the team of horses that are his,
And traces of his car, are seen.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The seven milk a single cow; the two set other five to work,
On the stream's loud-resounding bank.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Entreated by Vivasvān's ten, Indra cast down the water-jar
With threefold hammer from the sky.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Three times the newly-kindled flame proceeds around the sacrifice:
The priests anoint it with the meath.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  With reverence they drain the fount that circles with its wheel above,
Exhaustless, with the mouth below.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The pressing-stones are set at work: the meath is poured into the tank,
At the out-shedding of the fount.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Ye cows, protect the fount: the two Mighty Ones bless the sacrifice.
The handles twain are wrought of gold.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Pour on the juice the ornament which reaches both the heaven and earth
Supply the liquid to the Bull.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  These know their own abiding-place: like calves beside the mother cows
They meet together with their kin.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Devouring in their greedy jaws, they make sustaining food in heaven,
To Indra, Agni light and prayer.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The Pious One milked out rich food, sustenance dealt in portions seven,
Together with the Sun's seven rays.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  I took some Soma when the Sun rose up, O Mitra, Varuṇa.
That is the sick man's medicine.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  From where oblations must be laid, which is the Well-beloved's home,
He with his tongue hath compassed heaven.

## HYMN LXII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ROUSE ye for him who keeps the Law, yoke your steeds, Aśvins, to your car
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Come, Aśvins, with your car more swift than is the twinkling of an eye
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Aśvins, ye overlaid with cold the fiery pit for Atri's sake:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Where are ye? whither are ye gone? whither, like falcons, have ye flown?
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If ye at any time this day are listening to this my call,
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The Aśvins, first to hear our prayer, for closest kinship I approach:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For Atri ye, O Aśvins, made a dwelling-place to shield him well,
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye warded off the fervent heat for Atri when he sweetly spake:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Erst Saptavadhri by his prayer obtained the trenchant edge of fire:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Come hither, O ye Lords of wealth, and listen to this call of mine:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  What is this praise told forth of you as Elders in the ancient way?
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  One common brotherhood is yours, Aśvins your kindred is the same:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  This is your chariot, Aśvins, which speeds through the regions, earth and heaven
Let your protecting aid be near.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Approach ye hitherward to us with thousands both of steeds and kine:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Pass us not by, remember us with thousands both of kine and steeds:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The purple-tinted Dawn hath risen, and true to Law hath made the light
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He looked upon the Aśvins, as an axe-armed man upon a tree:
Let your protecting help be near.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  By the black band encompassed round, break it down, bold one, like a fort.
Let your protecting help be near.

## HYMN LXIII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  EXERTING all our strength with thoughts of power we glorify in speech
Agni your dear familiar Friend, the darling Guest in every home.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Whom, served with sacrificial oil like Mitra, men presenting gifts
Eulogize with their songs of praise
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Much-lauded Jātavedas, him who bears oblations up to heaven
Prepared in service of the Gods.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To noblest Agni, Friend of man, best Vṛtra-slayer, are we come,
Him in whose presence Rksa's son, mighty Srutarvan, waxes great;
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To deathless Jātavedas, meet for praise, adored, with sacred oil,
Visible through the gloom of night
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Even Agni whom these priestly men worship with sacrificial gifts,
With lifted ladles offering them.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Agni, this our newest hymn hath been addressed from us to thee,
O cheerful Guest, well-born, most wise, worker of wonders, ne’er deceived.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Agni, may it be dear to thee, most grateful, and exceeding sweet:
Grow mightier, eulogized therewith.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Splendid with splendours may it be, and in the battle with the foe
Add loftier glory to thy fame.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Steed, cow, a lord of heroes, bright like Indra, who shall fill the car.
Whose high renown ye celebrate, and people praise each glorious deed.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou whom Gopavana made glad with song, O Agni Aṅgiras,
Hear this my call, thou Holy One.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thou whom the priestly folk implore to aid the gathering of the spoil,
Such be thou in the fight with foes.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I, called to him who reels with joy, Srutarvan, Rksa's son, shall stroke
The heads of four presented steeds, like the long wool of fleecy rams.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Four coursers with a splendid car, Savistha's horses, fleet of foot,
Shall bring me to the sacred feast, as flying steeds brought Tugra's son.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The very truth do I declare to thee, Paruṣṇī, mighty flood.
Waters! no man is there who gives more horses than Savistha gives.

## HYMN LXIV. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YOKE, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invite the Gods: As ancient Herald seat thyself.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And, God, as skilfullest of all, call for us hitherward the Gods:
Give all our wishes sure effect.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For thou, Most Youthful, Son of Strength, thou to whom sacrifice is paid,
Art holy, faithful to the Law.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  This Agni, Lord of wealth and spoil hundredfold, thousandfold, is head
And chief of riches and a Sage.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As craftsmen bend the felly, so bend at our general call: come nigh,
Aṅgiras, to the sacrifice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now, O Virūpa, rouse for him, Strong God who shines at early morn,
Fair praise with voice that ceases not.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  With missile of this Agni, his who looks afar, will we lay low
The thief in combat for the kine.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let not the Companies of Gods fail us, like Dawns that float away,
Like cows who leave the niggardly.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Let not the sinful tyranny of any fiercely hating foe
Smite us, as billows smite a ship.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Agni, God, the people sing reverent praise to thee for strength:
With terrors trouble thou the foe.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Wilt thou not, Agni, lend us aid in winning cattle, winning wealth?
Maker of room, make room for us.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  In this great battle cast us not aside as one who bears a load:
Snatch up the wealth and win it all.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  O Agni, let this plague pursue and fright another and not us:
Make our impetuous strength more strong.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The reverent or unwearied man whose holy labour he accepts,
Him Agni favours with success.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Abandoning the foeman's host pass hither to this company:
Assist the men with whom I stand.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  As we have known thy gracious help, as of a Father, long ago,
So now we pray to thee for bliss.

## HYMN LXV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  NOT to forsake me, I invoke this Indra girt by Maruts,
Lord Of magic power who rules with might.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  This Indra with his Marut Friends clave into pieces Vṛtra's bead
With hundred-knotted thunderbolt.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra, with Marut Friends grown strong, hath rent asunder Vṛtra, and
Released the waters of the sea.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  This is that Indra who, begirt by Maruts, won the light of heaven
That he might drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Mighty, impetuous, begirt by Maruts, him who loudly roars,
Indra we invocate with songs.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Indra begirt by Maruts we invoke after the ancient plan,
That he may drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O liberal Indra, Marut-girt, much-lauded Śatakratu, drink
The Soma at this sacrifice.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To thee, O Indra, Marut-girt, these Soma juices, Thunderer!
Are offered from the heart with lauds.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Drink, Indra, with thy Marut Friends, pressed Soma at the morning rites,
Whetting thy thunderbolt with strength.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Arising in thy might, thy jaws thou shookest, Indra, having quaffed
The Soma which the mortar pressed.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Indra, both worlds complained to thee when uttering thy fearful roar,
What time thou smotest Dasyus dead.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  From Indra have I measured out a song eight-footed with nine parts,
Delicate, faithful. to the Law.

## HYMN LXVI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SCARCELY was Śatakratu, born when of his Mother he inquired,
Who are the mighty? Who are famed?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Śavasī declared to him Aurṇavābha, Ahīśuva:
Son, these be they thou must o’erthrow
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Vṛtra-slayer smote them all as spokes are hammered into naves:
The Dasyu-killer waxed in might.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then Indra at a single draught drank the contents of thirty pails,
Pails that were filled with Soma juice.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Indra in groundless realms of space pierced the Gandharva through, that he
Might make Brahmans' strength increase.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Down from the mountains Indra shot hither his well-directed shaft:
He gained the ready brew of rice.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  One only is that shaft of thine, with thousand feathers, hundred barbs,
Which, Indra, thou hast made thy friend.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Strong as the Ṛbhus at thy birth, therewith to those who praise thee, men,
And women, bring thou food to eat.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  By thee these exploits were achieved, the mightiest deeds, abundantly:
Firm in thy heart thou settest them.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  All these things Viṣṇu brought, the Lord of ample stride whom thou hadst sent-
A hundred buffaloes, a brew of rice and milk: and Indra, slew the ravening boar
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Most deadly is thy bow, successful, fashioned well: good is thine arrow, decked with gold.
Warlike and well equipped thine arms are, which increase sweetness for him who drinks the sweet.

## HYMN LXVII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BRING us a thousand, Indra, as our guerdon for the Soma juice:
Hundreds of kine, O Hero, bring.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Bring cattle, bring us ornament, bring us embellishment and steeds,
Give us, besides, two rings of gold.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And, Bold One, bring in ample store rich jewels to adorn the ear,
For thou, Good Lord, art far renowned.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  None other is there for the priest, Hero! but thou, to give him gifts,
To win much spoil and prosper him.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Indra can never be brought low, Śakra can never be subdued:
He heareth and beholdeth all.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  He spieth out the wrath of man, he who can never be deceived:
Ere blame can come he marketh it.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He hath his stomach full of might, the Vṛtra-slayer, Conqueror,
The Soma-drinker, ordering all.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  In thee all treasures are combined, Soma all blessed things in thee,
Uninjured, easy to bestow.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  To thee speeds forth my hope that craves the gift of corn, and kine and gold,
Yea, craving horses, speeds to thee.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Indra, through hope in thee alone even this sickle do I grasp.
Fill my hand, Maghavan, with all that it can hold of barley cut or gathered up.

## HYMN LXVIII. Soma.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THIS here is Soma, ne’er restrained, active, all-conquering bursting forth,
Ṛṣi and Sage by sapience,
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  All that is bare he covers o’er, all that is sick he medicines;
The blind man sees, the cripple walks.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou, Soma, givest wide defence against the hate of alien men,
Hatreds that waste and weaken us.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou by thine insight and thy skill, Impetuous One, from heaven and earth
Drivest the sinner's enmity.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When to their task they come with zeal, may they obtain the Giver's grace,
And satisfy his wish who thirsts.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So may he find what erst was lost, so may be speed the pious man,
And lengthen his remaining life.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Gracious, displaying tender love, unconquered, gentle in thy thoughts,
Be sweet, O Soma, to our heart.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Soma, terrify us not; strike us not with alarm, O King:
Wound not our heart with dazzling flame.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  When in my dwelling-place I see the wicked enemies of Gods,
King, chase their hatred far away, thou Bounteous One, dispel our foes.

## HYMN LXIX. Indra

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Sarakratu! truely I have made none else my Comforter.
Indra; be gracious unto us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou who hast ever aided us kindly of old to win the spoil,
As such, O Indra, favour us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  What now? As prompter of the poor thou helpest him who sheds the juice.
Wilt thou not, Indra, strengthen us?
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Indra, help our chariot on, yea, Thunderer, though it lag behind:
Give this my car the foremost place.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ho there! why sittest thou at case? Make thou my chariot to be first
And bring the fame of victory near.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Assist our car that seeks the prize. What can be easier for thee?
So make thou us victorious.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Indra, be firm: a fort art thou. To thine appointed place proceeds
The auspicious hymn in season due.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let not our portion be disgrace. Broad is the course, the prize is set,
The barriers are opened wide.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  This thing we wish. that thou mayst take thy fourth, thy sacrificial name.
So art thou held to be our Lord.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Ekadyu hath exalted you, Immortals: both Goddesses and Gods hath he delighted.
Bestow upon him bounty meet for praises. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.

## HYMN LXX. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDRA, God of the mighty arm, gather for us with thy right hand
Manifold and nutritious spoil.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  We know thee mighty in thy deeds, of mighty bounty, mighty wealth,
Mighty in measure, prompt to aid.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Hero, when thou art fain to give, neither may Gods nor mortal men
Restrain thee like a fearful Bull.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come, let us glorify Indra, Lord supreme of wealth, Self-ruling King:
In bounty may he harm us not.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let prelude sound and following chant so let him hear the Sāman sung,
And with his bounty answer us.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O Indra, with thy right hand bring, and with thy left remember us.
Let us not lose our share of wealth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Come nigh, O Bold One, boldly bring hither the riches of the churl
Who giveth least of all the folk.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Indra, the booty which thou hast with holy singers to receive,
Even that booty win with us.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Indra, thy swiftly-coming spoil, the booty which rejoices all,
Sounds quick in concert with our hopes.
