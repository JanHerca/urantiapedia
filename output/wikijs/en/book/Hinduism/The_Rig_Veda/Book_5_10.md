## HYMN I. Agni

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a milch-cow.
Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are rising to the vault of heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For worship of the Gods the Priest was wakened: at morning gracious Agni hath arisen.
Kindled, his radiant might is made apparent, and the great Deity set free from darkness.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When he hath stirred the line of his attendants, with the pure milk pure Agni is anointed.
The strength-bestowing gift is then made ready, which spread in front, with tongues, erect, he drinketh.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The spirits of the pious turn together to Agni, as the eyes of all to Sūrya.
He, when both Dawns of different hues have borne him, springs up at daybreak as a strong white charger.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The noble One was born at days' beginning, laid red in colour mid the well-laid fuel.
Yielding in every house his seven rich treasures, Agni is seated, Priest most skilled in worship.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Agni hath sat him down, a Priest most skilful, on a sweet-smelling place, his Mother's bosom.
Young, faithful, sage, preeminent o’er many, kindled among the folk whom he sustaineth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  This Singer excellent at sacrifices, Agni the Priest, they glorify with homage.
Him who spread out both worlds by Law Eternal they balm with oil, strong Steed who never faileth.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He, worshipful House-Friend, in his home is worshipped, our own auspicious guest, lauded by sages.
That strength the Bull with thousand horns possesses. In might, O Agni, thou excellest others.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou quickly passest by all others, Agni, for him to whom thou hast appeared most lovely,
Wondrously fair, adorable, effulgent, the guest of men, the darling of the people.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  To thee, Most Youthful God! to thee, O Agni from near and far the people bring their tribute.
Mark well the prayer of him who best extols thee. Great, high, auspicious, Agni, is thy shelter.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Ascend to-day thy splendid car, O Agni, in splendour, with the Holy Ones around it.
Knowing the paths by mid-air's spacious region bring hither Gods to feast on our oblation.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung forth our song of praise and homage.
Gavisthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud far-reaching, like gold light to heaven.

## HYMN II. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE youthful Mother keeps the Boy in secret pressed to her close, nor yields him to the Father.
But, when he lies upon the arm, the people see his unfading countenance before them.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  What child is this thou carriest as handmaid, O Youthful One? The Consort-Queen hath borne him.
The Babe unborn increased through many autumns. I saw him born what time his Mother bare him.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I saw him from afar gold-toothed, bright-coloured, hurling his weapons from his habitation,
What time I gave him Amṛta free from mixture. How can the Indraless, the hymnless harm me?
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I saw him moving from the place he dwells in, even as with a herd, brilliantly shining.
These seized him not: he had been born already. They who were grey with age again grow youthful.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Who separate my young bull from the cattle, they whose protector was in truth no stranger?
Let those whose hands have seized upon them free them. May he, observant, drive the herd to us-ward.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Mid mortal men godless have secreted the King of all who live, home of the people.
So may the prayers of Atri give him freedom. Reproached in turn be those who now reproach him.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou from the stake didst loose e’en Śunaḥśepa bound for a thousand; for he prayed with fervour.
So, Agni, loose from us the bonds that bind us, when thou art seated here, O Priest who knowest.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou hast sped from me, Agni, in thine anger: this the protector of Gods’ Laws hath told me.
Indra who knoweth bent his eye upon thee: by him instructed am I come, O Agni.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Agni shines far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his greatness makes all things apparent.
He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens both his horns to gore the Rakṣas.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Loud in the heaven above be Agni's roarings with keen-edged weapons to destroy the demons.
Forth burst his splendours in the Soma's rapture. The godless bands press round but cannot stay him.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  As a skilled craftsman makes a car, a singer I, Mighty One! this hymn for thee have fashioned.
If thou, O Agni, God, accept it gladly, may we obtain thereby the heavenly Waters.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  May he, the strong-necked Steer, waxing in vigour, gather the foeman's wealth with none to check him.
Thus to this Agni have the Immortals spoken. To man who spreads the grass may he grant shelter, grant shelter to the man who brings oblation.

## HYMN III. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THOU at thy birth art Varuṇa, O Agni; when thou art kindled thou becomest Mitra.
In thee, O Son of Strength, all Gods are centred. Indra art thou to man who brings oblation.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Aryaman art thou as regardeth maidens mysterious, is thy name, O Self-sustainer.
As a kind friend with streams of milk they balm thee what time thou makest wife and lord one-minded.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Maruts deck their beauty for thy glory, yea, Rudra! for thy birth fair, brightly-coloured.
That which was fixed as Viṣṇu's loftiest station—therewith the secret of the Cows thou guardest.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Gods through thy glory, God who art so lovely! granting abundant gifts gained life immortal.
As their own Priest have men established Agni; and serve him fain for praise from him who liveth.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  There is no priest more skilled than thou in worship; none Self-sustainer pass thee in wisdom.
The man within whose house as guest thou dwellest, O God, by sacrifice shall conquer mortals.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Aided by thee, O Agni may we conquer through our oblation, fain for wealth, awakened:
May we in battle, in the days’ assemblies, O Son of Strength, by riches conquer mortals.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He shall bring evil on the evil-plotter whoever turns against us sin and outrage.
Destroy this calumny of him, O Agni, whoever injures us with double-dealing.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  At this dawn's flushing, God! our ancient fathers served thee with offerings, making thee their envoy,
When, Agni, to the store of wealth thou goest, a God enkindled with good things by mortals.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Save, thou who knowest, draw thy father near thee, who counts as thine own son, O Child of Power.
O sapient Agni, when wilt thou regard us? When, skilled in holy Law, wilt thou direct us?
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Adoring thee he gives thee many a title, when thou, Good Lord! acceptest this as Father.
And doth not Agni, glad in strength of Godhead, gain splendid bliss when he hath waxen mighty?
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Most Youthful Agni, verily thou bearest thy praiser safely over all his troubles.
Thieves have been seen by us and open foemen: unknown have been the plottings of the wicked.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  To thee these eulogies have been directed: or to the Vasu hath this sin been spoken.
But this our Agni, flaming high, shall never yield us to calumny, to him who wrongs us.

## HYMN IV. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O AGNI, King and Lord of wealth and treasures, in thee is my delight at sacrifices.
Through thee may we obtain the strength we long for, and overcome the fierce attacks of mortals.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Agni, Eternal Father, offering-bearer, fair to behold, far-reaching, far-refulgent,
From well-kept household fire beam food to feed us, and measure out to us abundant glory.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Sage of men, the Lord of human races, pure, purifying Agni, balmed with butter,
Him the Omniscient as your Priest ye stablish: he wins among the Gods things worth the choosing.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni, enjoy, of one accord with Iḷā, striving in rivalry with beams of Sūrya,
Enjoy, O Jātavedas, this our fuel, and bring the Gods to us to taste oblations.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As dear House-Friend, guest welcome in the dwelling, to this our sacrifice come thou who knowest.
And, Agni, having scattered all assailants, bring to us the possessions of our foemen.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Drive thou away the Dasyu with thy weapon. As, gaining vital power for thine own body,
O Son of Strength, the Gods thou satisfiest, so in fight save us, most heroic Agni.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May we, O Agni, with our lauds adore thee, and with our gifts, fair-beaming Purifier!
Send to us wealth containing all things precious: bestow upon us every sort of riches.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Son of Strength, Agni, dweller in three regions, accept our sacrifice and our oblation.
Among the Gods may we be counted pious: protect us with a triply-guarding shelter.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Over all woes and dangers, Jātavedas, bear us as in a boat across a river.
Praised with our homage even as Atri praised thee, O Agni, be the guardian of our bodies.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As I, remembering thee with grateful spirit, a mortal, call with might on thee Immortal,
Vouchsafe us high renown, O Jātavedas, and may I be immortal by my children.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The pious man, O Jātavedas Agni, to whom thou grantest ample room and pleasure,
Gaineth abundant wealth with sons and horses, with heroes and with kine for his well-being.

## HYMN V. Āprīs.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To Agni, Jātavedas, to the flame, the well-enkindled God,
Offer thick sacrificial oil.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He, Narāśaṁsa, ne’er beguiled, inspiriteth this sacrifice:
For sage is he, with sweets in hand.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Adored, O Agni, hither bring Indra the Wonderful, the Friend,
On lightly-rolling car to aid.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Spread thyself out, thou soft as wool The holy hymns have sung to thee.
Bring gain to us, O beautiful!
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Open yourselves, ye Doors Divine, easy of access for our aid:
Fill, more and more, the sacrifice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Fair strengtheners of vital power, young Mothers of eternal Law,
Morning and Night we supplicate.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  On the wind's flight come, glorified, ye two celestial Priests of man
Come ye to this our sacrifice.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Iḷā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, three Goddesses who bring us weal,
Be seated harmless on the grass.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Rich in all plenty, Tvaṣṭar, come auspicious of thine own accord
Help us in every sacrifice.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Vanaspati, wherever thou knowest the Gods’ mysterious names,
Send our oblations thitherward.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  To Agni and to Varuṇa, Indra, the Maruts, and the Gods,
With Svāhā be oblation brought.

## HYMN VI. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I VALUE Agni that good Lord, the home to which the kine return:
Whom fleet-foot coursers seek as home, and strong enduring steeds as home. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  ’Tis Agni whom we laud as good, to whom the milch-kine come in herds,
To whom the chargers swift of foot, to whom our well-born princes come. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Agni the God of all mankind, gives, verily, a steed to man.
Agni gives precious gear for wealth, treasure he gives when he is pleased. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  God, Agni, we will kindle thee, rich in thy splendour, fading not,
So that this glorious fuel may send forth by day its light for thee. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To thee the splendid, Lord of flame, bright, wondrous, Prince of men, is brought.
Oblation with the holy verse, O Agni, bearer of our gifts.
Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  These Agnis in the seats of the fire nourish each thing most excellent.
They give delight, they spread abroad, they move themselves continually. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Agni, these brilliant flames of thine wax like strong chargers mightily,
Who with the treadings of their hoofs go swiftly to the stalls of kine. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To us who laud thee, Agni, bring fresh food and safe and happy homes.
May we who have sung hymns to thee have thee for envoy in each house. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou, brilliant God, within thy mouth warmest both ladles of the oil.
So fill us also, in our hymns, abundantly, O Lord of Strength. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thus Agni have we duly served with sacrifices and with hymns.
So may he give us what we crave, store of brave sons and fleet-foot steeds. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.

## HYMN VII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  OFFER to Agni, O my friends, your seemly food, your seemly praise;
To him supremest o’er the folk, the Son of Strength, the mighty Lord:
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Him in whose presence, when they meet in full assembly, men rejoice;
Even him whom worthy ones inflame, and living creatures bring to life.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When we present to him the food and sacrificial gifts of men,
He by the might of splendour grasps the holy Ordinance's rein.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He gives a signal in the night even to him who is afar,
When he, the Bright, unchanged by eld, consumes the sovrans of the wood.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He in whose service on the ways they offer up their drops of sweat,
On him is their high kin have they mounted, as ridges on the earth.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Whom, sought of many, mortal man hath found to be the Stay of all;
He who gives flavour to our food, the home of every man that lives.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Even as a herd that crops the grass he shears the field and wilderness,
With flashing teeth and beard of gold, deft with his unabated might.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For him, to whom, bright as an axe he, as to Atri, hath flashed forth,
Hath the well-bearing Mother borne, producing when her time is come.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Agni to whom the oil is shed by him thou lovest to support,
Bestow upon these mortals fame and splendour and intelligence.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Such zeal hath he, resistless one: he gained the cattle given by thee.
Agni, may Atri overcome the Dasyus who bestow no gifts, subdue the men who give no food.

## HYMN VIII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O AGNI urged to strength, the men of old who loved the Law enkindled thee,
the Ancient, for their aid,
Thee very bright, and holy, nourisher of all, most excellent, the Friend and Master of the home.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thee, Agni, men have stablished as their guest of old, as Master of the household, thee, with hair of flame;
High-bannered, multiform, distributor of wealth, kind helper, good protector, drier of the floods.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The tribes of men praise thee, Agni, who knowest well burnt offerings, the Discerner, lavishest of wealth,
Dwelling in secret, Blest One! visible to all, loud-roaring, skilled in worship, glorified with oil.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ever to thee, O Agni, as exceeding strong have we drawn nigh with songs and reverence singing hymns.
So be thou pleased with us, Aṅgiras! as a God enkindled by the noble with man's goodly light.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou, Agni! multiform, God who art lauded much! givest in every house subsistence as of old.
Thou rulest by thy might o’er food of many a sort: that light of thine when blazing may not be opposed.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The Gods, Most Youthful Agni, have made thee, inflamed, the bearer of oblations and the messenger.
Thee, widely-reaching, homed in sacred oil, invoked, effulgent, have they made the Eye that stirs the thought.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Men seeking joy have lit thee worshipped from of old, O Agni, with good fuel and with sacred oil.
So thou, bedewed and waxing mighty by the plants, spreadest thyself abroad over the realms of earth.

## HYMN IX. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BEARING; oblations mortal men, O Agni, worship thee the God.
I deem thee Jātavedas: bear our offerings, thou, unceasingly.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In the man's home who offers gifts, where grass is trimmed, Agni is Priest,
To whom all sacrifices come and strengthenings that win renown.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whom, as an infant newly-born, the kindling-sticks have brought to life,
Sustainer of the tribes of men, skilled in well-ordered sacrifice.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Yea, very hard art thou to grasp, like offspring of the wriggling snakes,
When thou consumest many woods like an ox, Agni, in the mead.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whose flames, when thou art sending forth the smoke, completely reach the mark,
When Tṛta in the height of heaven, like as a smelter fanneth thee, e’en as a smelter sharpeneth thee.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O Agni, by thy succour and by Mitra's friendly furtherance,
May we, averting hate, subdue the wickedness of mortal men.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Agni, to our heroes bring such riches, thou victorious God.
May he protect and nourish us, and help in gaining strength: be thou near us in fight for our success.

## HYMN X. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BRING us most mighty splendour thou, Agni, resistless on thy way.
With overflowing store of wealth mark out for us a path to strength.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ours art thou, wondrous Agni, by wisdom and bounteousness of power.
The might of Asuras rests on thee, like Mitra worshipful in act.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Agni, increase our means of life, increase the house and home of these,
The men, the princes who have won great riches through our hymns of praise.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Bright Agni, they who deck their songs for thee have horses as their meed.
The men are mighty in their might, they whose high laud, as that of heaven, awakes thee of its own accord.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Agni, those resplendent flames of thine go valorously forth,
Like lightnings flashing round us, like a rattling car that seeks the spoil.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Now, Agni, come to succour us; let priests draw nigh to offer gifts;
And let the patrons of our rites subdue all regions of the earth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Bring to us, Agni, Aṅgiras, lauded of old and lauded now,
Invoker! wealth to quell the strong, that singers may extol thee. Be near us in fight for our success.
