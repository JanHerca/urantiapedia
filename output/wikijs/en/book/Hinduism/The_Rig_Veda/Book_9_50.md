## HYMN XLI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ACTIVE and bright have they come forth, impetuous in speed like bulls,
Driving the black skin far away.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Quelling the riteless Dasyu, may we think upon the bridge of bliss,
Leaving the bridge of woe behind.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The mighty Pavamana's roar is heard as ’twere the rush of rain
Lightnings are flashing to the sky.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Pour out on us abundant food, when thou art pressed, O Indu wealth
In kine and gold and steeds and spoil.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Flow on thy way, Most Active, thou. fill full the mighty heavens and earth,
As Dawn, as Sūrya with his beams.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  On every side, O Soma, flow round us with thy protecting stream,
As Rasā flows around the world.

## HYMN XLII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ENGENDERING the Sun in floods, engendering heaven's lights, green-hued,
Robed in the waters and the milk,
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  According to primeval plan this Soma, with his stream, effused
Flows purely on, a God for Gods.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For him victorious, waxen great, the juices with a thousand powers
Are purified for winning spoil.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Shedding the ancient fluid he is poured into the cleansing sieve:
He, thundering, hath produced the Gods.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Soma, while purifying, sends hither all things to be desired,
He sends the Gods who strengthen Law.

Indu for Indra, for his drink.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Soma flows on when purified, beloved and adorned with songs,
Songs of the sage Medhyātithi.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Soma Pavamana, find exceeding glorious wealth for us,
Wealth, Indu, fraught with boundless might.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Like courser racing to the prize Indu, the lover of the Gods,
Roars, as he passes, in the sieve.

## HYMN XLIV. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDU, to us for this great rite, bearing as ’twere thy wave to Gods,
Unwearied, thou art flowing forQh.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Pleased with the hymn, impelled by prayer, Soma is hurried far away,
The Wise One in the Singer's stream.,
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Watchful among the. gods, this juice advances to the cleansing sieve
Soma, most active, travels on.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Flow onward, seeking strength for us, embellishing the sacrifice:
The priest with trimmed grass calleth thee.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May Soma, ever bringing power to Bhaga and to Vāyu, Sage
And Hero, lead us to the Gods.

The Gods, O better than our friends.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We balm thee, red of hue, with milk to fit thee for the rapturous joy:
Unbar for us the doors of wealth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He through the sieve hath passed, as comes a courser to the pole, to run

<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  All friends have lauded him as he sports in the wood, beyond the fleece:
Singers have chanted Indu's praise.

Who worships thee heroic strength.

<span id="h46"></span>

## HYMN XLVI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LIKE able coursers they have been sent forth to be the feast of Gods,
joying in mountains, flowing on.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To Vāyu flow the Soma-streams, the drops of juice made beautiful
Like a bride dowered by her sire.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Pressed in the mortar, these, the drops of
juice, the Somas rich in food,
Give strength to Indra with their work.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Deft-handed men, run hither, seize the brilliant juices blent with meal,
And cook with milk the gladdening draught.

joyous he riseth like a bull.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  His task is done: his crushings of the Dasyus are made manifest:
He sternly reckoneth their debts.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Soon as his song of praise is born, the Soma, Indra's juice, becomes
A thousand-winning thunderbolt.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Seer and Sustainer, he himself desireth riches for the sage
When he embellisheth his songs.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Fain would they both win riches as in races of the steeds. In war
Thou art upon the conquerors' side.

<span id="h48"></span>

## HYMN XLVIII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH sacrifice we seek to thee kind Cherisher of manly might
In mansions of the lofty heavens;
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Gladdening crusher of the bold, ruling with very mighty sway,
Destroyer of a hundred forts.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Hence, Sapient One! the Falcon, strong of wing, unwearied, brought thee down,
Lord over riches, from the sky.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  That each may see the light, the Bird brought us the guard of Law, the Friend
Of all, the speeder through the air.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And now, sent forth, it hath attained to mighty power and majesty,
Most active, ready to assist.

<span id="h49"></span>

## HYMN XLIX. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Poust down the rain upon us, pour a wave of waters from the sky,
And plenteous store of wholesome fbod.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Flow onward with that stream of thine, whereby the cows have come to us,
The kine of strangers to our home.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Chief Friend of Gods in sacred rites, pour on us fatness with thy stream,
Ppur down on us a flood of rain.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To give us vigour, with thy stream run through the fleecy straining-cloth
For verily the Gods will bear.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Onward hath Pavamana flowed and beaten off the Rākṣasas,
Flashing out splendour as of old.

<span id="h50"></span>

## HYMN L. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LOUD as a river's roaring wave thy powers have lifted up themselves:
Urge on thine arrow's sharpened point.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  At thine effusion upward rise three voices full of joy, when thou
Flowest upon the fleecy ridge.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  On to the fleece they urge with stone the tawny well-beloved One,
Even Pavamana, dropping meath.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Flow with thy current to the sieve, O Sage most powerful to cheer,
To seat thee in the place of song.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Flow, Most Exhilarating! flow anointed with the milk for balm,
Indu, for Indra, for his drink.
