Him who hath waxen great, invoked with beauteous songs, Immortal One, whose praise each day is sung aloud.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To Indra from all sides go forth my songs of praise, the Lord of Hundred Powers, strong, Hero, like the sea,
Swift, winner of the booty, breaker-down of forts, faithful and ever-glorious, finder of the light.

Full of all wondrous power he goes to conquest: worship is his, sole Lord from days aforetime.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Abundant are the gifts he gives to mortals: for him the earth bears a rich store of treasures.
The heavens, the growing plants, the living waters, the forest trees preserve their wealth for Indra.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  To thee, O Indra, Lord of Bays, for ever are offered prayers and songs: accept them gladly.
As Kinsman think thou of some fresh assistance; good Friend, give strength and life to those who praise thee.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Here, Indra, drink thou Soma with the Maruts, as thou didst drink the juice beside Śāryāta.
Under thy guidance, in thy keeping, Hero, the singers serve, skilled in fair sacrifices.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So eagerly desirous drink the Soma, our juice, O Indra, with thy friends the Maruts,
Since at thy birth all Deities adorned thee for the great fight, O thou invoked of many.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He was your comrade in your zeal, O Maruts: they, rich in noble gifts, rejoiced in Indra.
With them together let the Vṛtra-slayer drink in his home the worshipper's libation.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So, Lord of affluent gifts, this juice hath been pressed for thee with strength
Drink of it, thou who lovest song.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Incline thy body to this juice which suits thy Godlike nature well:
May it cheer thee who lovest it.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Brave Indra, let it work through both thy flanks, and through thy head by prayer,
And through thine arms, to prosper us.

<span id="h52"></span>

## HYMN LII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDRA, accept at break of day our Soma mixt with roasted corn,
With groats with cake, with eulogies.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Accept, O Indra, and enjoy the well-dressed sacrificial cake: Oblations are poured forth to thee.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Consume our sacrificial cake, accept the songs of praise we sing,
As he who woes accepts his bride.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Famed from of old, accept the cake at our libation poured at dawn,
Forgreat, O Indra, is thy power.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let roasted corn of our midday libation, and sacrificial cake here please thee, Indra,

<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  At the third sacrifice, O thou whom many praise, give glory to the roasted corn and holy cake.
With offered viands and with songs may we assist thee, Sage, whom Vāja and the Ṛbhus wait upon.

## HYMN LIII. Indra, Parvata, Etc.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ON a high car, O Parvata and Indra, bring pleasant viands, with brave heroes, hither.
Enjoy the gifts, Gods, at our sacrifices wax strong by hymns, rejoice in our oblation.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Stay still, O Maghavan, advance no farther. a draught of well-pressed Soma will I give thee.
With sweetest song I grasp, O Mighty Indra, thy garment's hem as a child grasps his father's.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Adhvaryu, sing we both; sing thou in answer: make we a laud acceptable to Indra.
Upon this sacrificer's grass he seated: to Indra shall our eulogy be uttered.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  A wife, O Maghavan is home and dwelling: so let thy Bay Steeds yoked convey thee hither.
Whenever we press out for thee the Soma, let Agni as our Herald speed to call thee.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Depart, O Maghavan;again come hither: both there and here thy goat is Indra, Brother,
Where thy tall chariot hath a place to rest in, and where thqu loosest thy loud-neighing Courser.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou hast drunk Soma, Indra, turn thee homeward; thy joy is in thy home, thy racious Consort;
Where thy tall chariot hath a place to rest in, and thy strong Courser is set free with guerdon.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Bounteous are these, Aṅgirases, Virupas: the Asura's Heroes and the Sons of Heaven.
They, giving store of wealth to Viśvāmitra, prolong his life through countless Soma-pressings.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Maghavan weareth every shape at pleasure, effecting magic changes in his body,
Holy One, drinker out of season, coming thrice, in a moment, through fit prayers, from heaven.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The mighty sage, God-born and God-incited, who looks on men, restrained the billowy river.
When Viśvāmitra was Sudās's escort, then Indra through the Kuśikas grew friendly.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Like swans, prepare a song of praise with pressing-stones, glad in your hymns with juice poured forth in sacrifice.
Ye singers, with the Gods, sages who look on men, ye Kutikas drink up the Soma's savoury meath.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Come forward, Kuśikas, and be attentive; let loose Sudās's horse to win him riches.
East, west, and north, let the King slay the foeman, then at earth's choicest place perform his worship.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Praises to Indra have I sung, sustainer of this earth and heaven. This prayer of Viśvāmitra keeps secure the race of Bharatas.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The Viśvāmitras have sung forth this prayer to Indra Thunder-aimed:
So let him make us prosperous.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Among the Kikatas what do thy cattle? They pour no milky draught, they heat no caldron.
Bring thou to us the wealth of Pramaganda;give up to us, O Maghavan, the low-born.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Sasarpari, the gift of Jamadagnis, hath lowed with mighty voice dispelling famine.
The Daughter of the Sun hath spread our glory among the Gods, imperishable, deathless.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Sasarpari brought glory speedily to these, over the generations of the Fivefold Race;
Daughter of Paksa, she bestows new vital power, she whom the ancient Jamadagnis gave to me.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Strong be the pair of oxen, firm the axles, let not the pole slip nor the yoke be broken.
May Indra, keep the yoke-pins from decaying: attend us, thou whose fellies are uninjured.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  O Indra, give our bodies strength, strength to the bulls who draw the wains,
Strength to our seed and progeny that they may live, for thou art he who giveth strength.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Enclose thee in the heart of Khayar timber, in the car wrought of Sinsapa put firmness.
Show thyself strong, O Axle, fixed and strengthened: throw us not from the car whereon we travel.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Let not this sovran of the wood leave us forlorn or injure us.
Safe may we be until we reach our homes and rest us and unyoke.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  With various aids this day come to us, Indra, with best aids speed us, Maghavan, thou Hero.
Let him who hatcth us fall headlong downward: him whom we hate let vital breath abandon.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  He heats his very axe, and then cuts a mere Semal blossom off.
O Indra, like a caldron cracked and seething, so he pours out foam.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Men notice not the arrow, O ye people; they bring the red beast deeming it a bullock.
A sluggish steed men run not with the courser, nor ever lead an ass before a charger.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  These men, the sons of Bhārata, O Indra, regard not severance or close connexion.
They urge their own steed as it were another's, and take him, swift as the bow's string, to battle.

<span id="h54"></span>

## HYMN LIV. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To him adorable, mighty, meet for synods, this strengthening hymn, unceasing, have they offered.
May Agni hear us with his homely splendours, hear us, Eternal One, with heavenly lustre.

Both, at whose laud in synods, showing favour, the Gods rejoice them with the living mortal.

To Heaven and Earth I offer this my homage, with food, O Agni, as I pray for riches.

And brave men in the fightwhere heroes conquer, O Earth, have known you well and paid you honour.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What pathway leadeth to the Gods? Who knoweth this of a truth, and who will now declare it?
Seen are their lowest dwelling-places only, but they are in remote and secret regions.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The Sage who looketh on mankind hath viewed them bedewed, rejoicing in the seat of Order.
They make a home as for a bird, though parted, with one same will finding themselves together.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Partners though parted, with far-distant limits, on one firm place both stand for ever watchful,
And, being young for evermore, as sisters, speak to each other names that are united.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  All living things they part and keep asunder; though bearing up the mighty Gods they reel not.
One All is Lord of what is fixed and moving, that walks, that flies, this multiform creation.

Singing the praise whereof the Gods by custom stand on the spacious far-extended pathway.

Take your delight, Ye Ṛbhus joined with Pūṣan: ye have prepared the rite with stones adjusted.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Borne on their flashing car, the spear-armed Maruts, the nimble Youths of Heaven, the Sons of Order,
The Holy, and Sarasvatī, shall hear us: ye Mighty, give us wealth with noble offspring.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  To Viṣṇu rich in marvels, songs And praises shall go as singers on the road of Bhaga,—
The Chieftain of the Mighty Stride, whose Mothers, the many young Dames, never disregard him.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Indra, who rules through all his powers heroic, hath with his majesty filled earth and heaven.
Lord of brave hosts, Fort-crusher, Vṛtra-slayer, gather thou up and bring us store of cattle.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  My Sires are the Nāsatyas, kind tokinsmen: the Aśvins' kinship is a glorious title.
For ye are they who give us store of riches: ye guard your gift uncheated by the bounteous.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  This is, ye Wise, your great and glorious title, that all ye Deities abide in Indra.
Friend, Much-invoked! art thou with thy dear Ṛbhus: fashion ye this our hymn for our advantage.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Aryaman, Aditi deserve our worship: the laws of Varuṇa remain unbroken.
The lot of childlessness remove ye from us, and let our course be rich in kine and offspring.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  May the Gods’ envoy, sent to many a quarter, proclaim us sinless for our perfect safety.
May Earth and Heaven, the Sun, the waters, hear us, and the wide firmament and constellations.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Hear us the mouatains which distil the rain-drops, and, resting firm, rejoice in freshening moisture.
May Aditi with the Ādityas hear us, and Maruts grant us their auspicious shelter.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Soft be our path for ever, well-provisioned: with pleasant meath, O Gods, the herbs besprinkle.
Safe be my bliss, O Agni, in thy friendship: may I attain the seat of foodful. riches,
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Enjoy the offering: beam thou strength upon us; combine thou for our good all kinds of glory.

For he sustaineth all the Gods.

Gives food fulfilling sacred Law.

## HYMN LX. Ṛbhus.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HERE is your ghostly kinship, here, O Men: they came desirous to these holy rites with store of wealth,
With wondrous arts, whereby, with schemes to meet each need, Ye gained, Sudhanvan's Sons! your share in sacrifice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The mighty powers wherewith. ye formed the chalices, the thought by which ye drew the cow from out the hide,
The intellect wherewith ye wrought the two Bay Steeds,—through these, O Ṛbhus, ye attained divinity.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Friendship with Indra have the Ṛbhus, fully gained: grandsons of Manu, they skilfully urged the work.
Sudhanvan's Children won them everlasting life, serving with holy rites, pious with noble acts.
4:In company with Indra come ye to the juice, then gloriously shall your wishes be fulfilled.
Not to be paragoned, ye Priests, are your good deeds, nor your heroic acts, Ṛbhus, Sudhanvan's Sons.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Indra, with the Ṛbhus, Mighty Ones, pour down the Soma juice effused, well-blent, from both thy hands.
Maghalan, urged by song, in the drink-offerer's house rejoice thee with the Heroes, with Sudhanvan's Sons.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  With Ṛbhu near, and Vāja, Indra, here exult, with Saci, praised of many, in the juice we pour.
These homes wherein we dwell have turned themselves to thee, -devotions to the Gods, as laws of men ordain.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Come with the mighty Ṛbhus, Indra, come to us, strengthening with thy help the singer's holy praise;
At hundred eager calls come to the living man, with thousand arts attend the act of sacrifice.
