## HYMN XXXI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE, Soma-drops, benevolent, come forth as they are purified,
Bestowing wealth which all may see.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Indu, high o’er heaven and earth be thou, increaser of our might:
The Master of all strength be thou.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The winds are gracious in their love to thee, the rivers flow to thee
Soma, they multiply thy power.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Soma, wax great. From every side may vigorous powers unite in thee:
Be in the gathering-Place of strength.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For thee, brown-hued! the kine have poured imperishable oil and milk.
Aloft on the sublimest height.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Friendship, O Indu, we desire with thee who bearest noble arms,
With thee, O Lord of all that is.

## HYMN XXXII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE rapture-shedding Soma-drops, effused in our assembly, have
Flowed forth to glorify our prince.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then Trita's Maidens onward urge the Tawny-coloured with the stones,
Indu for Indra, for his drink.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Now like a swan he maketh all the company sing each his hymn:
He, like a steed, is bathed in milk.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Soma, viewing heaven and earth, thou runncst like a darting deer
Set in the place of sacrifice.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The cows have sung with joy to him, even as a woman to her love
He came as to a settled race.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Bestow illustrious fame on us, both on our liberal lords and me,
Glory, intelligence, and wealth.

Of kine into the wooden vats.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To Indra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, to Viṣṇu, and the Maruts, flow
The drops of Soma juice effused.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Three several words are uttered: kine are \]owing, cows who give their milk:
The Tawny-hued goes bellowing on.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The young and sacred mothers of the holy rite have uttered praise:
They decorate the Child of Heaven.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  From every side, O Soma, for our profit, pour thou forth four seas
Filled full of riches thousandfold.

To Viṣṇu, flows the Soma juice.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With stones they press the Soma forth, the Strong conducted by the strong:
They milk the liquor out with skill.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  ’Tis he whom Trita must refine, ’tis he who shall make Indra glad:
The Tawny One is decked with tints.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Him do the Sons of Pṛśni milk, the dwelling-place of sacrifice,

Bearer of wealth to us with might.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With thee for Hero, Valiant One! may we subdue our enemies:
Let what is precious flow to us.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indu arouses strength the Sage who strives for victory, winning power,
Discovering holy works and means.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Mover of speech, we robe him with our songs as he is purified

The people all have set their hearts.

Turned to the vat that drops with meath.

Speeding like lover to his love.

Make thou the rain descend from heaven.

Far-seeing, sending forth its light.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  This is it which in rapid course hath with the river's wave flowed down
From heaven upon the straining cloth.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Inviting him frorh far away, and even from near at hand, the juice
For Indra is poured forth as meath.

Sit in the place of sacrifice.
