## HYMN XXXI Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SOLE Lord of wealth art thou, O Lord of riches: thou in thine hands hast held the people, Indra!
Men have invoked thee with contending voices for seed and waters, progeny and sunlight.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Through fear of thee, O Indra, all the regions of earth, though naught may move them, shake and tremble.
All that is firm is frightened at thy coming, -the earth, the heaven, the mountain, and the forest.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With Kutsa, Indra! thou didst conquer Śuṣṇa, voracious, bane of crops, in fight for cattle.
In the close fray thou rentest him: thou stolest the Sun's wheel and didst drive away misfortunes.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou smotest to the ground the hundred castles, impregnable, of Śambara the Dasyu,
When, Strong, with might thou holpest Divodāsa who poured libations out, O Soma-buyer, and madest Bharadvāja rich who praised thee.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As such, true Hero, for great joy of battle mount thy terrific car, O Brave and Manly.
Come with thine help to me, thou distant Roamer, and, glorious God, spread among men my glory.

<span id="h32"></span>

## HYMN XXXII Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I WITH my lips have fashioned for this Hero words never matched, most plentiful and auspicious,
For him the Ancient, Great, Strong, Energetic, the very mighty Wielder of the Thunder.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Amid the sages, with the Sun he brightened the Parents: glorified, he burst the mountain;
And, roaring with the holy-thoughted singers, he loosed the bond that held the beams of Morning.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Famed for great deeds, with priests who kneel and laud him, he still hath conquered in the frays for cattle,
And broken down the forts, the Fort-destroyer, a Friend with friends, a Sage among the sages.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come with thy girthed mares, with abundant vigour and plenteous strength to him who sings thy praises.
Come hither, borne by mares with many heroes, Lover of song! Steer! for the people's welfare.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Indra with rush and might, sped by his Coursers, hath swiftly won the waters from the southward.
Thus set at liberty the rivers daily flow to their goal, incessant and exhaustless.

<span id="h33"></span>

## HYMN XXXIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  GIVE us the rapture that is mightiest, Indra, prompt to bestow and swift to aid, O Hero,
That wins with brave steeds where brave steeds encounter, and quells the Vṛtras and the foes in battle.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For with loud voice the tribes invoke thee, Indra, to aid them in the battlefield of heroes.
Thou, with the singers, hast pierced through the Paṇis: the charger whom thou aidest wins the booty.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Both races, Indra, of opposing foemen, O Hero, both the Ārya and the Dāsa,
Hast thou struck down like woods with well-shot lightnings: thou rentest them in fight, most manly Chieftain!
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra, befriend us with no scanty succour, prosper and aid us, Loved of all that liveth,
When, fighting for the sunlight, we invoke thee, O Hero, in the fray, in war's division.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Be ours, O Indra, now and for the future, be graciously inclined and near to help us.
Thus may we, singing, sheltered by the Mighty, win many cattle on the day of trial.

<span id="h34"></span>

## HYMN XXXIV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FULL Many songs have met in thee, O Indra, and many a noble thought from thee proceedeth.
Now and of old the eulogies of sages, their holy hymns and lauds, have yearned for Indra.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He, praised of many, bold, invoked of many, alone is glorified at sacrifices.
Like a car harnessed for some great achievement, Indra must be the cause of our rejoicing.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They make their way to Indra and exalt him, bim whom no prayers and no laudations trouble;
For when a hundred or a thousand singers. laud him who loves the song their praise delights him.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As brightness mingles with the Moon in heaven, the offered Soma yearns to mix with Indra.
Like water brought to men in desert places, our gifts at sacrifice have still refreshed him.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To him this mighty eulogy, to Indra hath this our laud been uttered by the poets,
That in the great encounter with the foemen, Loved of all life, Indra may guard and help us.

<span id="h35"></span>

## HYMN XXXV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHEN shall our prayers rest in thy car beside thee? When dost thou give the singer food for thousands?
When wilt thou clothe this poet's laud with plenty, and when wilt thou enrich our hymns with booty?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When wilt thou gatber men with men, O Indra, heroes with heroes, and prevail in combat?
Thou shalt win triply kine in frays for cattle, so, Indra, give thou us celestial glory.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yea, when wilt thou, O Indra, thou Most Mighty, make the prayer all-sustaining for the singer?
When wilt thou yoke, as we yoke songs, thy Horses, and come to offerings that bring wealth in cattle?
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Grant to the Singer food with store of cattle, splendid with horses and the fame of riches.
Send food to swell the milch-cow good at milking: bright be its shine among the Bharadvājas.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Lead otherwise this present foeman, Śakra! Hence art thou praised as Hero, foe destroyer
Him who gives pure gifts may I praise unceasing. Sage, quicken the Aṅgirases by devotion.

<span id="h36"></span>

## HYMN XXXVI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THY raptures ever were for all men's profit: so evermore have been thine earthly riches.
Thou still hast been the dealer-forth of vigour, since among Gods thou hast had power and Godhead.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Men have obtained his strength by sacrificing, and ever urged him, on to hero valour.
For the rein-seizing, the impetuous Charger they furnished power even for Vṛtra's slaughter.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Associate with him, as teams of horses, help, manly might, and vigour follow Indra.
As rivers reach the sea, so, strong with praises, our holy songs reach him the Comprehensive.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Lauded by us, let flow the spring, O Indra, of excellent and brightly-shining riches.
For thou art Lord of men, without an equal: of all the world thou art the only Sovran.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Hear what thou mayst hear, thou who, fain for worship, as heaven girds earth, guardest thy servant's treasure;
Tlat thou mayst be our own, joying in power, famed through thy might in every generation.

<span id="h37"></span>

## HYMN XXXVII Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET thy Bay Horses, yoked, O mighty Indra, bring thy car hither fraught with every blessing.
For thee, the Heavenly, e’en the poor invoketh: may we this day, thy feast-companions, prosper.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Forth to the vat the brown drops flow for service, and purified proceed directly forward.
May Indra drink of this, our guest aforetime, Celestial King of the strong draught of Soma.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bringing us hitherward all-potent Indra on well-wheeled chariot, may the Steeds who bear him
Convey him on the road direct to glory, and ne’er may Vāyu's Amṛta cease and fail him.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Supreme, he stirs this man to give the guerdon,—Indra, most efficacious of the princes,—
Wherewith, O Thunderer, thou removest sorrow, and, Bold One! partest wealth among the nobles.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Indra is hewho gives enduring vigour: may our songs magnify the God Most Mighty.
Best Vṛtra-slayer be the Hero Indra these things he gives as Prince, with strong endeavour.

<span id="h38"></span>

## HYMN XXXVIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HE hath drunk hence, Most Marvellous, and carried away our great and splendid call on Indra.
The Bounteous, when we serve the Gods, accepteth song yet more famous and the gifts we bring him.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The speaker filleth with a cry to Indra his ears who cometh nigh e’en from a distance.
May this my call bring Indra to my presence, this call to Gods composed in sacred verses.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Him have I sung with my best song and praises, Indra of ancient birth and Everlasting.
For prayer and songs in him are concentrated: let laud wax mighty when addressed to Indra:
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra, whom sacrifice shall strengthen, Soma, and song and hymn, and praises and devotion,
Whom Dawns shall strengthen when the night departeth, Indra whom days shall strengthen, months, and autumns.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Him, born for conquering might in full perfection, and waxen strongfor bounty and for glory,
Great, Powerful, will we to-day, O singer, invite to aid. us and to quell our foemen.

<span id="h39"></span>

## HYMN XXXIX Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  OF this our charming, our celestial Soma, eloquent, wise, Priest, with inspired devotion,
Of this thy close attendant, hast thou drunken. God, send the singer food with milk to grace it.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Craving the kine, rushing against the mountain led on by Law, with holyminded comrades,
He broke the never-broken ridge of Vala. With words of might Indra subdued the Paṇis.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  This Indu lighted darksome nights, O Indra, throughout the years, at morning and at evening.
Him have they stablished as the days' bright ensign. He made the Mornings to be born in splendour.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He shone and caused to shme the worlds that shone not. By Law he lighted up the host of Mornings.
He moves with Steeds yoked by eternal Order, contenting men with nave that finds the sunlight.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Now, praised, O Ancient King! fill thou the singer with plenteous food that he may deal forth treasures.
Give waters, herbs that have no poison, forests, and kine, and steeds, and men, to him who lauds thee.

<span id="h40"></span>

## HYMN XL. Indra

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  DRINK, Indra; juice is shed to make thee joyful: loose thy Bay Steeds and give thy friends their freedom.
Begin the song, seated in our assembly. Give strength for sacrifice to him who singeth.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Drink thou of this whereof at birth, O Indra, thou drankest, Mighty One for power and rapture.
The men, the pressing-stones, the cows, the waters have made this Soma ready for thy drinking.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The fire is kindled, Soma pressed, O Indra: let thy Bays, best to draw, convey thee hither.
With mind devoted, Indra, I invoke thee. Come, for our great prosperity approach us.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra, come hither: evermore thou camest through our great strong desire to drink the Soma.
Listen and hear the prayers which now we offer, and let this sacrifice increase thy vigour.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Mayst thou, O Indra, on the day of trial, present or absent, wheresoe’er thou dwellest,
Thence, with thy team, accordant with the Maruts, Song-lover! guard our sacrifice, to help us.
