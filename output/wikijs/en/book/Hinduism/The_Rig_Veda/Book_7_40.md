## HYMN XXXI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SING ye a song, to make him glad, to Indra, Lord of Tawny Steeds,
The Soma-drinker, O my friends.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To him the Bounteous say the laud, and let us glorify, as men May do, the Giver of true gifts.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Indra, Lord of boundless might, for us thou winnest strength and kine,
Thou winnest gold for us, Good Lord.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Faithful to thee we loudly sing, heroic Indra, songs to thee: Mark, O Good Lord, this act of ours.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Give us not up to man's reproach, to foeman's hateful calumny: In thee alone is all my strength.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou art mine ample coat of mail, my Champion, Vṛtra-Slayer, thou:
With thee for Friend I brave the foe.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yea, great art thou whose conquering might two independent Powers confess.
The Heaven, O India, and the Earth.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So let the voice surround thee, which attends the Maruts on their way,
Reaching thee with the rays of light.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Let the ascending drops attain to thee, the Wondrous God, in heaven:
Let all the folk bow down to thee.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Bring to the Wise, the Great, who waxeth mighty, your offerings, and make ready your devotion;
To many clans he goeth, man's controller.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For Indra, the sublime, the far-pervading, have singers generated prayer and praises:
The sages never violate his statutes.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The choirs have stablished Indra King for ever, for victory, him whose anger is resistless:
And, for the Bays' Lord, strengthened those he loveth.

## HYMN XXXII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET none, no, not thy worshippers, delay thee far away from us.
Even from far away come thou unto our feast, or listen if already here.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For here, like flies on honey, these who pray to thee sit by the juice that they have poured.
Wealth-craving singers have on Indra set their hope, as men set foot upon a car.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Longing for wealth I call on him, the Thunderer with the strong right hand,
As a son calleth on his sire.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These Soma juices, mixed with curd, have been expressed for Indra here.
Come with thy Bay Steeds, Thunder-wielder, to our home, to drink them till they make thee glad.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May he whose ear is open hear us. He is asked for wealth: will he despise our prayer?
Him who bestows at once a hundred thousand gifts none shall restrain when he would give.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The hero never checked by men hath gained his strength through Indra, he
Who presses out and pours his deep libations forth, O Vṛtra-slayer, unto thee.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When thou dost drive the fighting men together be, thou Mighty One, the mighty's shield.
May we divide the wealth of him whom thou hast slain: bring us, Unreachable, his goods.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For Indra, Soma-drinker, armed with thunder, press the Soma juice.
Make ready your dressed meats: cause him to favour us. The Giver blesses him who gives.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Grudge not, ye Soma pourers; stir you, pay the rites, for wealth, to the great Conqueror.
Only the active conquers dwells in peace, and thrives: not for the niggard are the Gods.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  No one hath overturned or stayed the car of him who freely gives.
The man whom Indra and the Marut host defend comes to a stable full of kine.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Indra, that man when fighting shall obtain the spoil, whose strong defender thou wilt be.
Be thou the gracious helper, Hero I of our cars, be thou the helper of our men.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  His portion is exceeding great like a victorious soldier's spoil.
Him who is Indra, Lord of Bays, no foes subdue. He gives the Soma-pourer strength.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Make for the Holy Gods a hymn that is not mean, but well-arranged and fair of form.
Even many snares and bonds subdue not him who dwells with Indra through his sacrifice.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Indra, what mortal will attack the man who hath his wealth in thee?
The strong will win the spoil on the decisive day through faith in thee, O Maghavan.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  In battles with the foe urge on our mighty ones who give the treasures dear to thee,
And may we with our princes, Lord of Tawny Steeds! pass through all peril, led by thee.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Thine, Indra, is the lowest wealth, thou cherishest the mid-most wealth,
Thou ever rulest all the highest: in the fray for cattle none resisteth thee.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Thou art renowned as giving wealth to every one in all the battles that are fought.
Craving protection, all these people of the earth, O Much-invoked, implore thy name.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  If I, O Indra, were the Lord of riches ample as thine own,
I should support the singer, God. who givest wealth! and not abandon him to woe.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Each day would I enrich the man who sang my praise, in whatsoever place he were.
No kinship is there better, Maghavan, than thine: a father even is no more.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  With Plenty for his true ally the active man will gain the spoil.
Your Indra, Much-invoked, I bend with song, as bends a wright his wheel of solid wood.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  A moral wins no riches by unworthy praise: wealth comes not to the niggard churl.
Light is the task to give, O Maghavan, to one like me on the decisive day.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Like kine unmilked we call aloud, Hero, to thee, and sing thy praise,
Looker on heavenly light, Lord of this moving world, Lord, Indra, of what moveth not.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  None other like to thee, of earth or of the heavens, hath been or ever will be born.
Desiring horses, Indra Maghavan! and kine, as men of might we call on thee.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Bring, Indra, the Victorious Ones; bring, elder thou, the younger host.
For, Maghavan, thou art rich in treasures from of old, and must be called in every fight.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Drive thou away our enemies, O Maghavan: make riches easy to be won.
Be thou our good Protector in the strife for spoil: Cherisher of our friends be thou.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  O Indra, give us wisdom as a sire gives wisdom to his sons.
Guide us, O Much-invoked, in this our way may we still live and look upon the light.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Grant that no mighty foes, unknown, malevolent, unhallowed, tread us to the ground.
With thine assistance, Hero, may we ass through all the waters that are rul\`ng down.

## HYMN XXXIII Vasiṣṭha.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THESE who wear hair-knots on the right, the movers of holy thought, white-robed, have won me over.
I warned the men, when from the grass I raised me, Not from afar can my Vasisthas help you.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With Soma they brought Indra from a distance, Over Vaisanta, from the strong libation.
Indra preferred Vasisthas to the Soma pressed by the son of Vayata, Pasadyumna.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So, verily, with these he crossed the river, in company with these he slaughtered Bheda.
So in the fight with the Ten Kings, Vasisthas! did Indra help Sudās through your devotions.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I gladly, men I with prayer prayed by our fathers have fixed your axle: ye shall not be injured:
Since, when ye sang aloud the Sakvari verses, Vasisthas! ye invigorated Indra.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Like thirsty men they looked to heaven, in battle with the Ten Kings, surrounded and imploring.
Then Indra heard Vasiṣṭha as he praised him, and gave the Trtsus ample room and freedom.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Like sticks and staves wherewith they drive the cattle, Stripped bare, the Bharatas were found defenceless:
Vasiṣṭha then became their chief and leader: then widely. were the Trtsus' clans extended.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Three fertilize the worlds with genial moisture: three noble Creatures cast a light before them.
Three that give warmth to all attend the morning. All these have they discovered, these Vasisthas.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Like the Sun's growing glory is their splendour, and like the sea's is their unflathomed greatness.
Their course is like the wind's. Your laud, Vasisthas, can never be attained by any other.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They with perceptions of the heart in secret resort to that which spreads a thousand branches.
The Apsaras brought hither the Vasisthas wearing the vesture spun for them by Yama.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  A form of lustre springing from the lightning wast thou, when Varuṇa and Mitra saw thee.
Tliy one and only birth was then, Vasiṣṭha, when from thy stock Agastya brought thee hither.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Born of their love for Urvasi, Vasiṣṭha thou, priest, art son of Varuṇa and Mitra;
And as a fallen drop, in heavenly fervour, all the Gods laid thee on a lotus-blossorn.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He thinker, knower both of earth and heaven, endowed with many a gift, bestowing thousands,
Destined to wear the vesture spun by Yama, sprang from the Apsaras to life, Vasiṣṭha.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Born at the sacrifice, urged by adorations, both with a common flow bedewed the pitcher.
Then from the midst thereof there rose up Māna, and thence they say was born the sage Vasiṣṭha.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He brings the bearer of the laud and Sāman: first shall he speak bringing the stone for pressing.
With grateful hearts in reverence approach him: to you, O Pratrdas, Vasiṣṭha cometh.

## HYMN XXXIV Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY our divine and brilliant hymn go forth, like a swift chariot wrought and fashioned well.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The waters listen as they flow along: they know the origin of heaven and earth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yea, the broad waters swell their flood ior him: of him strong heroes think amid their foes.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Set ye for him the coursers to the pole: like Indra Thunderer is the Golden-armed.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Arouse you, like the days, to sacrifice speed gladly like a traveller on the way.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Go swift to battles, to the sacrifice: set up a flag, a hero for the folk.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Up from his strength hath risen as ’twere a light: it bears the load as earth bears living things.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Agni, no demon I invoke the Gods: by law completing it, I form a hymn.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Closely albout you lay your heavenly song, and send your voice to where the Gods abide.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Varuṇa, Mighty, with a thousand eyes, beholds the paths wherein these rivers run.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He, King of kings, the glory of the floods, o’er all that liveth hath resistless sway.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  May he assist us among all the tribes, and make the envier's praise devoid of light.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  May the foes' threatening arrow pass us by: may he put far from us our bodies' sin.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Agni, oblation-cater, through our prayers aid us: to him our dearest laud is brought.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Accordant with the Gods choose for our Friend the Waters’ Child: may he be good to us.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  With lauds I sing the Dragon born of floods: he sits beneath the streams in middle air.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Ne’er may the Dragon of the Deep harm us: ne’er fail this faithful servant's sacrifice.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  To these our heroes may they grant renown: may pious men march boldly on to wealth.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Leading great hosts, with fierce attacks of these, they burn their foes as the Sun burns the earth.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  What time our wives draw near to us, may he, left-handed Tvaṣṭar, give us hero sons.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  May Tvaṣṭar find our hymn acceptable, and may Aramati, seeking wealth, be ours.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  May they who lavish gifts bestow those treasures: may Rodasī and Varuṇānī listen.
May he, with the Varūtrīs, be our refuge, may bountiful Tvaṣṭar give us store of riches.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  So may rich Mountains and the liberal Waters, so may all Herbs that grow on ground, and Heaven,
And Earth accordant with the Forest-Sovrans, and both the World-halves round about protect us.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  To this may both the wide Worlds lend approval, and Varuṇa in heaven, whose Friend is Indra.
May all the Maruts give consent, the Victors, that we may hold great wealth in firm possession.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Agni, Waters, Herbs, Trees accept the praise we offer.
May we find refuge in the Marut's bosom. Protect us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XXXVI. Viśvedevas

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET the prayer issue from the seat of Order, for Sūrya with his beams hath loosed the cattle.
With lofty ridges earth is far extended, and Agni's flame hath lit the spacious surface.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Asuras, O Varuṇa and Mitra, this hymn to you, like food, anew I offer.
One of you is a strong unerring Leader, and Mitra, speaking, stirreth men to labour.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The movements of the gliding wind come hither: like cows, the springs are filled to overflowing.
Born in the station e’en of lofty heaven the Bull hath loudly bellowed in this region.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May I bring hither with my song, O Indra, wise Aryaman who yokes thy dear Bay Horses,
Voracious, with thy noble car, O Hero, him who defeats the wrath of the malicious.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In their own place of sacrifice adorers worship to gain long life and win his friendship.
He hath poured food on men when they have praised him; be this, the dearest reverence, paid to Rudra.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Coming together, glorious, loudly roaring - Sarasvatī, Mother of Floods, the seventh-
With copious milk, with fair streams, strongly flowing, full swelling with the volume of their water;
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And may the mighty Maruts, too, rejoicing, aid our devotion and protect our offspring.
Let not swift-moving Aksara neglect us: they have increased our own appropriate riches,

Bhaga who looks upon this hymn with favour, and, as our strength, the bountiful Purandbi.

## HYMN XXXVII. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET your best-bearing car that must be lauded, ne’er injured, bring you Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans.
Fill you, fair-helmeted! with mighty Soma, thrice-mixed, at our libations to delight you.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye who behold the light of heaven, Ṛbhukṣans, give our rich patrons unmolested riches.
Drink, heavenly-natured. at our sacrifices, and give us bounties for the hymns we sing you.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For thou, O Bounteous One, art used to giving, at parting treasure whether small or ample.
Filled full are both thine arms with great possessions: thy goodness keeps thee not from granting riches.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra, high-famed, as Vāja and Ṛbhukṣans, thou goest working, singing to the dwelling.
Lord of Bay Steeds, this day may we Vasisthas offer our prayers to thee and bring oblations.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou winnest swift advancement for thy servant, through hymns, Lord of Bay Steeds, which thou hast favoured.
For thee with friendly succour have we battled, and when, O Indra, wilt thou grant us riches?

May thy strong Steed, through our ancestral worship, bring food and wealth with heroes to our dwelling.

With three close Friends to length of days he cometh, he whom men let not rest at home in quiet.

May the Celestial Guardian still attend us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XXXVIII. Savitar.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ON high hath Savitar, this God, extended the golden lustre which he spreads around him.
Now, now must Bhaga be invoked by mortals, Lord of great riches who distributes treasures.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Rise up, O Savitar whose hands are golden, and hear this man while sacrifice is offered,
Spreading afar thy broad and wide effulgence, and bringing mortal men the food that feeds them.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Let Savitar the God he hymned with praises, to whom the Vasus, even, all sing glory.
Sweet be our lauds to him whose due is worship: may he with all protection guard our princes.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Even he whom Aditi the Goddess praises, rejoicing in God Savitar's incitement:
Even he who praise the high imperial Rulers, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, sing in concert.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They who come emulous to our oblation, dispensing bounty, from the earth and heaven.
May they and Ahibudhnya hear our calling: guard us Varūtrī with the Ekadhenus.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  This may the Lord of Life, entreated, grant us,—the wealth which Savitar the God possesses.
The mighty calls on Bhaga for protection, on Bhaga calls the weak to give him riches.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Bless us the Vajins when we call, while slowly they move, strong Singers, to the Gods’ assembly.
Crushing the wolf, the serpent, and the demons, may they completely banish all affliction.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Deep-skilled in Law eternal, deathless, Singers, O Vajins, help us in each fray for booty.
Drink of this meath, he satisfied, be joyful: then go on paths which Gods are wont to travel.

## HYMN XXXIX Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AGNI, erect, hath shown enriching favour: the flame goes forward to the Gods’ assembly.
Like car-borne men the stones their path have chosen: let the priest, quickened, celebrate our worship.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Soft to the tread, their sacred grass is scattered: these go like Kings amid the band around them,
At the folks early call on Night and Morning,—Vāyu, and Pūṣan with his team, to bless us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Here on their path the noble Gods proceeded: in the wide firmament the Beauteous decked them.
Bend your way hither, ye who travel widely: hear this our envoy who hath gone to meet you.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For they are holy aids at sacrifices: all Gods approach the place of congregation.
Bring these, desirous, to our worship, Agni, swift the Nisatyas, Bhaga, and Purandhi.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Agni, to these men's hymns, from earth, from heaven, bring Mitra, Varuṇa, Indra, and Agni,
And Aryaman, and Aditi, and Viṣṇu. Sarasvatī be joyful, and the Maruts.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Even as the holy wish, the gift is offered: may he, unsated, come when men desire him.
Give never-failing ever-conquering riches: with Gods for our allies may we be victors.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas; and holy Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni.
May they, bright Deities, make our song supremest. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XL. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BE gathered all the audience of the synod: let us begin their praise whose course is rapid.
Whate’er God Savitar this day produces, may we be where the Wealthy One distributes.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  This, dealt from heaven ' may both the Worlds vouchsafe us, and Varuṇa, Indra, Aryaman, and Mitra.
May Goddess Aditi assign us riches, Vāyu and Bhaga make them ours for ever.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Strong be the man and full of power, O Maruts, whom ye, borne on by spotted coursers, favour.
Him, too, Sarasvatī and Agni further, and there is none to rob him of his riches.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  This Varuṇa is guide of Law, he, Mitra, and Aryaman, the Kings, our work have finished.
Divine and foeless Aditi quickly listens. May these deliver us unharmed from trouble.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  With offerings I propitiate the branches of this swift-moving God, the bounteous Viṣṇu.
Hence Rudra gained his Rudra-strength: O Aśvins, ye sought the house that hath celestial viands.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Be not thou angry here, O glowing Pūṣan, for what Varūtrī and the Bounteous gave us.
May the swift-moving Gods protect and bless us, and Vāta send us rain, wha wanders round us.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas, and holy Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni.
May they, bright Deities, make our song supremest. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
