## HYMN I. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I Laud Agni, the chosen Priest, God, minister of sacrifice,
The hotar, lavishest of wealth.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Worthy is Agni to be praised by living as by ancient seers.
He shall bring hitherward the Gods.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Through Agni man obtaineth wealth, yea, plenty waxing day by day,
Most rich in heroes, glorious.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni, the perfect sacrifice which thou encompassest about
Verily goeth to the Gods.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May Agni, sapient-minded Priest, truthful, most gloriously great,
The God, come hither with the Gods.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Whatever blessing, Agni, thou wilt grant unto thy worshipper,
That, Aṅgiras, is indeed thy truth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  To thee, dispeller of the night, O Agni, day by day with prayer
Bringing thee reverence, we come
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ruler of sacrifices, guard of Law eternal, radiant One,
Increasing in thine own abode.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Be to us easy of approach, even as a father to his son:
Agni, be with us for our weal.

<span id="h2"></span>

## HYMN II. Vāyu.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BEAUTIFUL Vāyu, come, for thee these Soma drops have been prepared:
Drink of them, hearken to our call.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Knowing the days, with Soma juice poured forth, the singers glorify
Thee, Vāyu, with their hymns of praise.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Vāyu, thy penetrating stream goes forth unto the worshipper,
Far-spreading for the Soma draught.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These, Indra-Vāyu, have been shed; come for our offered dainties’ sake:
The drops are yearning for you both.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Well do ye mark libations, ye Vāyu and Indra, rich in spoil!
So come ye swiftly hitherward.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Vāyu and Indra, come to what the Soma-presser hath prepared:
Soon, Heroes, thus I make my prayer.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Mitra, of holy strength, I call, and foe-destroying Varuṇa,
Who make the oil-fed rite complete.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Mitra and Varuṇa, through Law, lovers and cherishers of Law,
Have ye obtained your might power
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Our Sages, Mitra-Varuṇa, wide dominion, strong by birth,
Vouchsafe us strength that worketh well.

<span id="h3"></span>

## HYMN III. Aśvins

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YE Aśvins, rich in treasure, Lords of splendour, having nimble hands,
Accept the sacrificial food.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye Aśvins, rich in wondrous deeds, ye heroes worthy of our praise,
Accept our songs with mighty thought.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Nāsatyas, wonder-workers, yours are these libations with clipt grass:
Come ye whose paths are red with flame.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Indra marvellously bright, come, these libations long for thee,
Thus by fine fingers purified.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Urged by the holy singer, sped by song, come, Indra, to the prayers,
Of the libation-pouring priest.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Approach, O Indra, hasting thee, Lord of Bay Horses, to the prayers.
In our libation take delight.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ye Viśvedevas, who protect, reward, and cherish men, approach
Your worshipper's drink-offering.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye Viśvedevas, swift at work, come hither quickly to the draught,
As milch-kine hasten to their stalls.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The Viśvedevas, changing shape like serpents, fearless, void of guile,
Bearers, accept the sacred draught
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Wealthy in spoil, enriched with hymns, may bright Sarasvatī desire,
With eager love, our sacrifice.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Inciter of all pleasant songs, inspirer of all gracious thought,
Sarasvatī accept our rite
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Sarasvatī, the mighty flood,—she with her light illuminates,
She brightens every pious thought.

<span id="h4"></span>

## HYMN IV. Indra

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As a good cow to him who milks, we call the doer of fair deeds,
To our assistance day by day.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Come thou to our libations, drink of Soma; Soma-drinker thou!
The rich One's rapture giveth kine.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So may we be acquainted with thine innermost benevolence:
Neglect us not, come hitherward.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Go to the wise unconquered One, ask thou of Indra, skilled in song,
Him who is better than thy friends.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whether the men who mock us say, Depart unto another place,
Ye who serve Indra and none else;
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Or whether, God of wondrous deeds, all our true people call us blest,
Still may we dwell in Indra's care.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Unto the swift One bring the swift, man-cheering, grace of sacrifice,
That to the Friend gives wings and joy.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou, Śatakratu, drankest this and wast the Vṛtras’ slayer; thou
Helpest the warrior in the fray.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  We strengthen, Śatakratu, thee, yea, thee the powerful in fight,
That, Indra, we may win us wealth.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  To him the mighty stream of wealth, prompt friend of him who pours the juice,
Yea, to this Indra sing your song.

<span id="h5"></span>

## HYMN V. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O COME ye hither, sit ye down: to Indra sing ye forth, your song,
companions, bringing hymns of praise.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To him the richest of the rich, the Lord of treasures excellent,
Indra, with Soma juice outpoured.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May he stand by us in our need and in abundance for our wealth:
May he come nigh us with his strength.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whose pair of tawny horses yoked in battles foemen challenge not:
To him, to Indra sing your song.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Nigh to the Soma-drinker come, for his enjoyment, these pure drops,
The Somas mingled with the curd.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou, grown at once to perfect strength, wast born to drink the Soma juice,
Strong Indra, for preëminence.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Indra, lover of the song, may these quick Somas enter thee:
May they bring bliss to thee the Sage.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Our chants of praise have strengthened thee, O Śatakratu, and our lauds
So strengthen thee the songs we sing.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Indra, whose succour never fails, accept these viands thousandfold,
Wherein all manly powers abide.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Indra, thou who lovest song, let no man hurt our bodies, keep
Slaughter far from us, for thou canst.

<span id="h6"></span>

## HYMN VI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the ruddy Steed
The lights are shining in the sky.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  On both sides to the car they yoke the two bay coursers dear to him,
Bold, tawny, bearers of the Chief.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O men: where form was not,
Wast born together with the Dawns.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thereafter they, as is their wont, threw off the state of babes unborn,
Assuming sacrificial names.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou, Indra, with the Tempest-Gods, the breakers down of what is firm,
Foundest the kine even in the cave.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Worshipping even as they list, singers laud him who findeth wealth,
The far-renowned, the mighty One.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Mayest thou verily be seen coming by fearless Indra's side:
Both joyous, equal in your sheen.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  With Indra's well beloved hosts, the blameless, hastening to heaven,
The sacrificer cries aloud.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Come from this place, O Wanderer, or downward from the light of heaven:
Our songs of praise all yearn for this.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Indra we seek to give us help, from here, from heaven above the earth,
Or from the spacious firmament.

<span id="h7"></span>

## HYMN VII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDRA the singers with high praise, Indra reciters with their lauds,
Indra the choirs have glorified.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Indra hath ever close to him his two bay steeds and word-yoked car,
Indra the golden, thunder-armed.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra hath raised the Sun on high in heaven, that he may see afar:
He burst the mountain for the kine.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained,
With awful aids, O awful One.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In mighty battle we invoke Indra, Indra in lesser fight,
The Friend who bends his bolt at fiends.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Unclose, our manly Hero, thou for ever bounteous, yonder cloud,
For us, thou irresistible.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Still higher, at each strain of mine, thunder-armed Indra's praises rise:
I find no laud worthy of him.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Even as the bull drives on the herds, he drives the people with his might,
The Ruler irresistible:
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Indra who rules with single sway men, riches, and the fivefold race
Of those who dwell upon the earth.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For your sake from each side we call Indra away from other men:
Ours, and none others’, may he be.

<span id="h8"></span>

## HYMN VIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDRA, bring wealth that gives delight, the victor's ever-conquering wealth,
Most excellent, to be our aid;
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  By means of which we may repel our foes in battle hand to hand,
By thee assisted with the car.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Aided by thee, the thunder-armed, Indra, may we lift up the bolt,
And conquer all our foes in fight.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  With thee, O India, for ally with missile-darting heroes, may
We conquer our embattled foes.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Mighty is Indra, yea supreme; greatness be his, the Thunderer:
Wide as the heaven extends his power
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Which aideth those to win them sons, who come as heroes to the fight,
Or singers loving holy thoughts.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  His belly, drinking deepest draughts of Soma, like an ocean swells,
Like wide streams from the cope of heaven.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So also is his excellence, great, vigorous, rich in cattle, like
A ripe branch to the worshipper.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For verily thy mighty powers, Indra, are saving helps at once
Unto a worshipper like me.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So are his lovely gifts; let lauds and praises be to Indra sung,
That he may drink the Soma juice.

<span id="h9"></span>

## HYMN IX. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  COME, Indra, and delight thee with the juice at all the Soma feasts,
Protector, mighty in thy strength.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To Indra pour ye forth the juice, the active gladdening juice to him
The gladdening, omnific God.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Lord of all men, fair of cheek, rejoice thee in the gladdening lauds,
Present at these drink-offerings.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Songs have outpoured themselves to thee, Indra, the strong, the guardian Lord,
And raised themselves unsatisfied.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Send to us bounty manifold, O Indra, worthy of our wish,
For power supreme is only thine.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O Indra, stimulate thereto us emulously fain for wealth,
And glorious, O most splendid One.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Give, Indra, wide and lofty fame, wealthy in cattle and in strength,
Lasting our life-time, failing not.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Grant us high fame, O Indra, grant riches bestowing thousands, those
Fair fruits of earth borne home in wains.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Praising with songs the praise-worthy who cometh to our aid, we call
Indra, the Treasure-Lord of wealth.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  To lofty Indra, dweller by each libation, the pious man
Sings forth aloud a strengthening hymn.

<span id="h10"></span>

## HYMN X. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE chanters hymn thee, they who say the word of praise magnify thee.
The priests have raised thee up on high, O Śatakratu, like a pole.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As up he clomb from ridge to ridge and looked upon the toilsome task,
Indra observes this wish of his, and the Rain hastens with his troop.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Harness thy pair of strong bay steeds, long-maned, whose bodies fill the girths,
And, Indra, Soma-drinker, come to listen to our songs of praise.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come hither, answer thou the song, sing in approval, cry aloud.
Good Indra, make our prayer succeed, and prosper this our sacrifice.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To Indra must a laud be said, to strengthen him who freely gives,
That Śakra may take pleasure in our friendship and drink-offerings.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Him, him we seek for friendship, him for riches and heroic might.
For Indra, he is Śakra, he shall aid us while he gives us wealth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Easy to turn and drive away, Indra, is spoil bestowed by thee.
Unclose the stable of the kine, and give us wealth O Thunder-armed
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The heaven and earth contain thee not, together, in thy wrathful mood.
Win us the waters of the sky, and send us kine abundantly.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Hear, thou whose ear is quick, my call; take to thee readily my songs
O Indra, let this laud of mine come nearer even than thy friend.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  We know thee mightiest of all, in battles hearer of our cry.
Of thee most mighty we invoke the aid that giveth thousandfold.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Indra, Son of Kuśika, drink our libation with delight.
Prolong our life anew, and cause the seer to win a thousand gifts.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Lover of song, may these our songs on every side encompass thee:
Strengthening thee of lengthened life, may they be dear delights to thee.
