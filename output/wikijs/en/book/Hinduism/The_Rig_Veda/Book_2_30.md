## HYMN XXI.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To him the Lord of all, the Lord of wealth, of light; him who is Lord for ever, Lord of men and tilth,
Him who is Lord of horses, Lord of kine, of floods, to Indra, to the Holy bring sweet Soma juice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To him the potent One, who conquers and breaks down, the Victor never vanquished who disposes all,
The mighty-voiced, the rider, unassailable, to Indra everconquering speak your reverent prayer.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Still Victor, loved by mortals, ruler over men, o’erthrower, warrior, he hath waxen as he would;
Host-gatherer, triumphant, honoured mid the folk. Indra's heroic deeds will I tell forth to all.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The strong who never yields, who slew the furious fiend, the deep, the vast, of wisdom unattainable;
Who speeds the good, the breaker-down, the firm, the vast,—Indra whose rites bring joy hath made the light of Dawn.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  By sacrifice the yearning sages sending forth their songs found furtherance from him who speeds the flood.
In Indra seeking help with worship and with hymn, they drew him to themselves and won them kine and wealth.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Indra, bestow on us the best of treasures, the spirit of ability and fortune;
Increase of riches, safety of our bodies, charm of sweet speech, and days of pleasant weather.

## HYMN XXII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  At the Trikadrukas the Great and Strong hath drunk drink blent with meal. With Viṣṇu hath he quaffed the poured out Soma juice, all that he would.
That hath so heightened him the Great, the Wide, to do his mighty work.
So may the God attain the God, true Indu Indra who is true.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So he resplendent in the battle overcame Krivi by might. He with his majesty hath filled the earth and heaven, and waxen strong.
One share of the libation hath he swallowed down: one share he left.
So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Brought forth together with wisdom and mighty power thou grewest great; with hero deeds subduing the malevolent, most swift in act;
Giving prosperity, and lovely wealth to him who praiseth thee. So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  This, Indra, was thy hero deed, Dancer, thy first and ancient work, worthy to be told forth in heaven,
What time thou sentest down life with a God's own power, freeing the floods.
All that is godless may he conquer with his might, and, Lord of Hundred Powers, find for us strength and food.

## HYMN XXIII. Brahmaṇaspati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WE call thee, Lord and Leader of the heavenly hosts, the wise among the wise, the famousest of all,
The King supreme of prayers, O Brahmaṇaspati: hear us with help; sit down in place of sacrifice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Bṛhaspati, God immortal! verily the Gods have gained from thee, the wise, a share in holy rites.
As with great light the Sun brings forth the rays of morn, so thou alone art Father of all sacred prayer.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When thou hast chased away revilers and the gloom, thou mountest the refulgent car of sacrifice;
The awful car, Bṛhaspati, that quells the foe, slays demons, cleaves the stall of kine, and finds the light.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou leadest with good guidance and preservest men; distress o’ertakes not him who offers gifts to thee.
Him who hates prayer thou punishest, Bṛhaspati, quelling his wrath: herein is thy great mightiness.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  No sorrow, no distress from any side, no foes, no creatures double-tongued have overcome the man,—
Thou drivest all seductive fiends away from him whom, careful guard, thou keepest Brahmaṇaspati.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou art our keeper, wise, preparer of our paths: we, for thy service, sing to thee with hymns of praise.
Bṛhaspati, whoever lays a snare for us, him may his evil fate, precipitate, destroy.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Him, too, who threatens us without offence of ours, the evilminded, arrogant, rapacious man,—
Him turn thou from our path away, Bṛhaspati: give us fair access to this banquet of the Gods.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thee as protector of our bodies we invoke, thee, saviour, as the comforter who loveth us.
Strike, O Bṛhaspati, the Gods’ revilers down, and let not the unrighteous come to highest bliss.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Through thee, kind prosperer, O Brahmaṇaspati, may we obtain the wealth of Men which all desire:
And all our enemies, who near or far away prevail against us, crush, and leave them destitute.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  With thee as our own rich and liberal ally may we, Bṛhaspati, gain highest power of life.
Let not the guileful wicked man be lord of us:—still may we prosper, singing goodly hymns of praise.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Strong, never yielding, hastening to the battle-cry, consumer of the foe, victorious in the strife,
Thou art sin's true avenger, Brahmaṇaspati, who tamest e’en the fierce, the wildly passionate.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Whoso with mind ungodly seeks to do us harm, who, deeming him a man of might mid lords, would slay,—
Let not his deadly blow reach us, Bṛhaspati; may we humiliate the strong ill-doer's wrath.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The mover mid the spoil, the winner of all wealth, to be invoked in fight and reverently adored,
Bṛhaspati hath overthrown like cars of war all wicked enemies who fain would injure us.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Burn up the demons with thy fiercest flaming brand, those who have scorned thee in thy manifested might.
Show forth that power that shall deserve the hymn of praise: destroy the evil speakers, O Bṛhaspati.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Bṛhaspati, that which the foe deserves not which shines among the folk effectual, splendid,
That, Son of Law I which is with might refulgent-that treasure wonderful bestow thou on us.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Give us not up to those who, foes in ambuscade, are greedy for the wealth of him who sits at ease,
Who cherish in their heart abandonment of Gods. Bṛhaspati, no further rest shall they obtain.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For Tvaṣṭar, he who knows each sacred song, brought thee to life, preeminent o’er all the things that be.
Guilt-scourger, guilt-avenger is Bṛhaspati, who slays the spoiler and upholds the mighty Law.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The mountain, for thy glory, cleft itself apart when, Aṅgiras! thou openedst the stall of kine.
Thou, O Bṛhaspati, with Indra for ally didst hurl down water-floods which gloom had compassed round.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O Brahmaṇaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn and prosper thou our children.
All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.

## HYMN XXIV. Brahmaṇaspati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BE pleased with this our offering, thou who art the Lord; we will adore thee with this new and mighty song.
As this thy friend, our liberal patron, praises thee, do thou, Bṛhaspati, fulfil our hearts' desire.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He who with might bowed down the things that should be bowed, and in his fury rent the holds of Śambara:
Who overthrew what shook not, Brahmaṇaspati,—he made his way within the mountain stored with wealth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  That was a great deed for the Godliest of the Gods: strong things were loosened and the firmly fixed gave way.
He drave the kine forth and cleft Vala through by prayer, dispelled the darkness and displayed the light of heaven.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The well with mouth of stone that poured a flood of meath, which Brahmaṇaspati hath opened with his might—
All they who see the light have drunk their fill thereat: together they have made the watery fount flow forth.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ancient will be those creatures, whatsoe’er they be; with moons, with autumns, doors unclose themselves to you.
Effortless they pass on to perfect this and that, appointed works which Brahmaṇaspati ordained.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They who with much endeavour searching round obtained the Paṇis’ noblest treasure hidden in the cave,—
Those sages, having marked the falsehoods, turned them back whence they had come, and sought again to enter in.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The pious ones when they had seen the falsehoods turned them back, the sages stood again upon the lofty ways.
Cast down with both their arms upon the rock they left the kindled fire, and said, No enemy is he.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  With his swift bow, strung truly, Brahmaṇaspati reaches the mark whate’er it be that he desires.
Excellent are the arrows wherewithal he shoots, keen-eyed to look on men and springing from his ear.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He brings together and he parts, the great High Priest; extolled is he, in battle Brahmaṇaspati.
When, gracious, for the hymn he brings forth food and wealth, the glowing Sun untroubled sends forth fervent heat.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  First and preeminent, excelling all besides are the kind gifts of liberal Bṛhaspati.
These are the boons of him the Strong who should be loved, whereby both classes and the people have delight.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou who in every way supreme in earthly power, rejoicing, by thy mighty strength hast waxen great,—
He is the God spread forth in breadth against the Gods: he, Brahmaṇaspati, encompasseth this All.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  From you, twain Maghavans, all truth proceedeth: even the waters break not your commandment.
Come to us, Brahmaṇaspati and Indra, to our oblation like yoked steeds to fodder.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The sacrificial flames most swiftly hear the call: the priest of the assembly gaineth wealth for hymns.
Hating the stern, remitting at his will the debt, strong in the shock of fight is Brahmaṇaspati.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The wrath of Brahmaṇaspati according to his will had full effect when he would do a mighty deed.
The kine he drave forth and distributed to heaven, even as a copious flood with strength flows sundry ways.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  O Brahmaṇaspati, may we be evermore masters of wealth well-guided, full of vital strength.
Heroes on heroes send abundantly to us, when thou omnipotent through prayer seekest my call.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  O Brahmaṇaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn, and prosper thou our children.
All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.

## HYMN XXV. Brahmaṇaspati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HE lighting up the flame shall conquer enemies: strong shall he be who offers prayer and brings his gift.
He with his seed spreads forth beyond another's seed, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With heroes he shall overcome his hero foes, and spread his wealth by kine wise by himself is be.
His children and his children's children grow in strength, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He, mighty like a raving river's billowy flood, as a bull conquers oxen, overcomes with strength.
Like Agni's blazing rush he may not be restrained, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For him the floods of heaven flow never failing down: first with the heroes he goes forth to war for kine.
He slays in unabated vigour with great might, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  All roaring rivers pour their waters down for him, and many a flawless shelter hath been granted him.
Blest with the happiness of Gods he prospers well, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.

## HYMN XXVI. Brahmaṇaspati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE righteous singer shall o’ercome his enemies, and he who serves the Gods subdue the godless man.
The zealous man shall vanquish the invincible, the worshipper share the food of him who worships not.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Worship, thou hero, chase the arrogant afar: put on auspicious courage for the fight with foes.
Prepare oblation so that thou mayst have success. we crave the favouring help of Brahmaṇaspati.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He with his folk, his house, his family, his sons, gains booty for himself, and, with the heroes, wealth,
Who with oblation and a true believing heart serves Brahmaṇaspati the Father of the Gods.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whoso hath honoured him with offerings rich in oil, him Brahmaṇaspati leads forward on his way,
Saves him from sorrow, frees him from his enemy, and is his wonderful deliverer from woe.

## HYMN XXVII. Ādityas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THESE hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever offer to the Kings Ādityas.
May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuṇa Dakṣa, and Aṁśa.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With one accord may Aryaman and Mitra and Varuṇa this day accept this praise-song—
Ādityas bright and pure as streams of water, free from all guile and falsehood, blameless, perfect.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These Gods, Ādityas, vast, profound, and faithful, with many eyes, fain to deceive the wicked,
Looking within behold the good and evil near to the Kings is even the thing most distant.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Upholding that which moves and that which moves not, Ādityas, Gods, protectors of all being,
Provident, guarding well the world of spirits, true to eternal Law, the debt-exactors.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May I, Ādityas, share m this your favour which, Aryaman, brings profit e’en in danger.
Under your guidance, Varuṇa and Mitra, round troubles may I pass, like rugged places.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Smooth is your path, O Aryaman and Mitra; excellent is it, Varuṇa, and thornless.
Thereon, Ādityas, send us down your blessing: grant us a shelter hard to be demolished.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Mother of Kings, may Aditi transport us, by fair paths Aryaman, beyond all hatred.
May we uninjured, girt by many heroes, win Varuṇa's and Mitra's high protection.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  With their support they stay three earths, three heavens; three are their functions in the Gods’ assembly.
Mighty through Law, Ādityas, is your greatness; fair is it, Aryaman, Varuṇa, and Mitra.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Golden and splendid, pure like streams of water, they hold aloft the three bright heavenly regions.
Ne’er do they slumber, never close their eyelids, faithful, far-ruling for the righteous mortal.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thou over all, O Varuṇa, art Sovran, be they Gods, Asura! or be they mortals.
Grant unto us to see a hundred autumns ours be the blest long lives of our forefathers.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Neither the right nor left do I distinguish, neither the cast nor yet the west, Ādityas.
Simple and guided by your wisdom, Vasus! may I attain the light that brings no danger.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  He who bears gifts unto the Kings, true Leaders, he whom their everlasting blessings prosper,
Moves with his chariot first in rank and wealthy, munificent and lauded in assemblies.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Pure, faithful, very strong, with heroes round him, he dwells beside the waters rich with pasture.
None slays, from near at hand or from a distance, him who is under the Ādityas’ guidance.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Aditi, Mitra, Varuṇa, forgive us however we have erred and sinned against you.
May I obtain the broad light free from peril: O Indra, let not during darkness seize us.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  For him the Twain united pour their fulness, the rain from heaven: he thrives most highly favoured.
He goes to war mastering both the mansions: to him both portions of the world are gracious.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Your guiles, ye Holy Ones, to quell oppressors, your snares spread out against the foe, Ādityas,
May I car-borne pass like a skilful horseman: uninjured may we dwell in spacious shelter.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  May I not live, O Varuṇa, to witness my wealthy, liberal, dear friend's destitution.
King, may O never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.

## HYMN XXVIII. Varuṇa

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THIS laud of the self-radiant wise Āditya shall be supreme o’er all that is in greatness.
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  beg renown of Varuṇa the Mighty, the God exceeding kind to him who worships.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Having extolled thee. Varuṇa, with thoughtful care may we have high fortune in thy service,
Singing thy praises like the fires at coming, day after day, of mornings rich in cattle.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May we be in thy keeping, O thou Leader wide-ruling Varuṇa, Lord of many heroes.
O sons of Aditi, for ever faithful, pardon us, Gods, admit us to your friendship.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He made them flow, the Āditya, the Sustainer: the rivers run by Varuṇa's commandment.
These feel no weariness, nor cease from flowing: swift have they flown like birds in air around us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Loose me from sin as from a bond that binds me: may we swell, Varuṇa, thy spring of Order.
Let not my thread, while I weave song, be severed, nor my work's sum, before the time, be shattered.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Far from me, Varuṇa, remove all danger accept me graciously, thou Holy Sovran.
Cast off, like cords that hold a calf, my troubles: I am not even mine eyelid's lord without thee.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Strike us not, Varuṇa, with those dread weapons which, Asura, at thy bidding wound the sinner.
Let us not pass away from light to exile. Scatter, that we may live, the men who hate us
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O mighty Varuṇa, now and hereafter, even as of old, will we speak forth our worship.
For in thyself, invincible God, thy statutes ne’er to be moved are fixed as on a mountain.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Move far from me what sins I have committed: let me not suffer, King, for guilt of others.
Full many a morn remains to dawn upon us: in these, O Varuṇa, while we live direct us.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O King, whoever, be he friend or kinsman, hath threatened me affrighted in my slumber-
If any wolf or robber fain would harm us, therefrom, O Varuṇa, give thou us protection.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  May I not live O Varuṇa, to witness my wealthy, liberal dear friend's destitution.
King, may I never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.

## HYMN XXIX. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  UPHOLDERS of the Law, ye strong Ādityas, remove my sin like her who bears in secret.
You, Varuṇa, Mitra and all Gods who listen, I call to help me, I who know your goodness.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye, Gods, are providence and ye are power: remove ye utterly all those who hate us.
As givers of good things deal with us kindly: this day be gracious to us and hereafter.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  What service may we do you with our future, what service, Vasus, with our ancient friendship?
O Aditi, and Varuṇa and Mitra, Indra and Maruts, make us well and happy.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ye, O ye Gods, are verily our kinsmen as such be kind to me who now implore you.
Let not your car come slowly to our worship: of kinsmen such as you ne’er let us weary.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I singly have sinned many a sin against you, and ye chastised me as a sire the gambler.
Far be your nets, far, Gods, be mine offences: seize me not like a bird upon her offspring.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Turn yourselves hitherward this day, ye Holy, that fearing in my heart I may approach you.
Protect us, God; let not the wolf destroy us. Save us, ye Holy, from the pit and falling.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May I not live, O Varuṇa, to witness my wealthy, liberal, dear friend's destitution.
King, may I never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.

<span id="h30"></span>

## HYMN XXX. Indra and Others.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE streams unceasing flow to Indra, slayer of Ahi, Savitar, God, Law's fulfiller,
Day after day goes on the sheen of waters. What time hath past since they were first set flowing?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  His Mother—for she knew—spake and proclaimed him who was about to cast his bolt at Vṛtra.
Cutting their paths according to his pleasure day after day flow to their goal the rivers.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Aloft he stood above the airy region, and against Vṛtra shot his deadly missile.
Enveloped in a cloud he rushed upon him. Indra subdued the foe with sharpened weapons.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As with a bolt, Bṛhaspati, fiercely flaming, pierce thou Vṛkadvaras’, the Asura's, heroes.
Even as in time of old with might thou slewest, so slay even now our enemy, O Indra.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Cast down from heaven on high thy bolt of thunder wherewith in joy thou smitest dead the foeman.
For gain of children make us thine, O Indra, of many children's children and of cattle.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Whomso ye love, his power ye aid and strengthen; ye Twain are the rich worshipper's advancers.
Graciously favour us, Indra and Soma; give us firm standing in this time of danger.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let it not vex me, tire me, make me slothful, and never let us say, Press not the Soma;
For him who cares for me, gives gifts, supports me, who comes with kine to me who pour libations.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Sarasvatī, protect us: with the Maruts allied thou boldly conquerest our foemen,
While Indra does to death the daring chieftain of Śaṇḍikas exulting in his prowess.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Him who waylays, yea, him who would destroy us,—aim at him, pierce him with thy sharpened weapon.
Bṛhaspati, with arms thou slayest foemen O King, give up the spoiler to destruction.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Perform, O Hero, with our valiant heroes the deeds heroic which thou hast to finish.
Long have they been inflated with presumption: slay them, and bring us hither their possessions.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I craving joy address with hymn and homage your heavenly host, the company of Maruts,
That we may gain wealth with full store of heroes, each day more famous, and with troops of children.
