## HYMN XXI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  PRESSED is the juice divine with milk commingled: thereto hath Indra ever been accustomed.
We wake thee, Lord of Bays, with sacrifices: mark this our laud in the wild joy of Soma.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  On to the rite they move, the grass they scatter, these Soma-drinkers eloquent in synod.
Hither, for men to grasp, are brought the press-stones, far-thundering, famous, strong, that wait on heroes.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra, thou settest free the many waters that were encompassed, Hero, by the Dragon.
Down rolled, as if on chariots borne, the rivers: through fear of thee all things created tremble.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Skilled in all manly deeds the God terrific hath with his weapons mastered these opponents.
Indra in rapturous joy shook down their castles he slew them in his might, the Thunder-wielder.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  No evil spirits have impelled us, Indra, nor fiends, O Mightiest God, with their devices.
Let our true God subdue the hostile rabble: let not the lewd approach our holy worship.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou in thy strength surpassest Earth and Heaven: the regions comprehend not all thy greatness.
With thine own power and might thou slewest Vṛtra: no foe hath found the end of thee in battle.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Even the earlier Deities submitted their powers to thy supreme divine dominion.
Indra wins wealth and deals it out to other's: men in the strife for booty call on Indra.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The humble hath invoked thee for protection, thee, Lord of great felicity, O Indra.
Thou with a hundred aids hast been our Helper: one who brings gifts like thee hath his defender.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  May we, O Indra, be thy friends for ever, eagerly, Conqueror, yielding greater homage.
May, through thy grace, the strength of us who battle quell in the shock the onset of the foeman.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Place us by food which thou hast given, O Indra, us and the wealthy patrons who command us.
Let thy great power bring good to him who lauds thee. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.

## HYMN XXII Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  DRINK Soma, Lord of Bays, and let it cheer thee: Indra, the stone, like a well guided courser,
Directed by the presser's arms hath pressed it.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So let the draught of joy, thy dear companion, by which, O Lord of Bays, thou slayest foemen,
Delight thee, Indra, Lord of princely treasures.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Mark closely, Maghavan, the words I utter, this eulogy recited by Vasiṣṭha:
Accept the prayers I offer at thy banquet.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Hear thou the call of the juice-drinking press-stone: hear thou the Brahman's hymn who sings and lauds thee.
Take to thine inmost self these adorations.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I know and ne’er forget the hymns and praises of thee, the Conqueror, and thy strength immortal.
Thy name I ever utter. Self-Refulgent
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Among mankind many are thy libations, and many a time the pious sageinvokes thee.
O Maghavan, be not long distant from us.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  All these libations are for thee, O Hero: to thee I offer these my prayers. that strengthen.
Ever, in every place, must men invoke thee.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Never do men attain, O Wonder-Worker, thy greatness, Mighty One, who must be lauded,
Nor, Indra, thine heroic power and bounty.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Among all Ṛṣis, Indra, old and recent, who have engendered hymns as sacred singers,
Even with us be thine auspicious friendships. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.

## HYMN XXIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  PRAYERS have been offered up through love of glory: Vasiṣṭha, honour Indra in the battle.
He who with might extends through all existence hears words which I, his faithful servant, utter.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A cry was raised which reached the Gods, O Indra, a cry to them to send us strength in combat.
None among men knows his own life's duration: bear us in safety over these our troubles.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Bays, the booty-seeking car I harness: my prayers have reached him who accepts them gladly.
Indra, when he had slain resistless foemen, forced with his might the two world-halves asunder.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Like barren cows, moreover, swelled the waters: the singen sought thy holy rite, O Indra.
Come unto us as with his team comes Vāyu: thou, through our solemn hymns bestowest booty.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So may these gladdening draughts rejoice thee, Indra, the Mighty, very bounteous to the singer.
Alone among the Gods thou pitiest mortals: O Hero, make thee glad at this libation.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thus the Vasisthas glorify with praises Indra, the Powerful whose arm wields thunder.
Praised, may he guard our wealth in kine and heroes. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.

## HYMN XXIV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  A HOME is made for thee to dwell in, Indra: O Much-invoked, go thitherwith the heroes.
That thou, to prosper us, mayst be our Helper, vouchsafe us wealth, rejoice with draughts of Soma.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Indra, thy wish, twice-strong, is comprehended: pressed is the Soma, poured are pleasant juices.
This hymn of praise, from loosened tongue, made perfect, draws Indra to itself with loud invoking.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Come, thou Impetuous; God, from earth or heaven; come to our holy grass to drink the Soma.
Hither to me let thy Bay Horses bring thee to listen to our hymns and make thee joyful.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come unto us with all thine aids, accordant, Lord of Bay Steeds, accepting our devotions,
Fair-helmeted, o’ercoming with the mighty, and lending us the strength of bulls, O Indra.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As to the chariot pole a vigorous courser, this laud is brought to the great strong Upholder.
This hymn solicits wealth of thee: in heaven, as ’twere above the sky, set thou our glory.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  With precious things. O Indra, thus content us: may we attain to thine exalted favour.
Send our chiefs plenteous food with hero children. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XXV. Indra.

WHEN with thy mighty help, O potent Indra, the armies rush together in their fury.
When from the strong man's arm the lightning flieth, let not the mind go forth to side with others.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Indra, where the ground is hard to traverse, smite down our foes, the mortals who assail us,
Keep far from us the curse of the reviler: bring us accumulated store of treasures.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  God of the fair helm, give Sudās a hundred succours, a thousand blessings, and thy bounty.
Strike down the weapon of our mortal foeman: bestow upon us splendid fame and riches.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I wait the power of one like thee, O Indra, gifts of a Helper such as thou art, Hero.
Strong, Mighty God, dwell with me now and ever: Lord of Bay Horses, do not thou desert us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Here are the Kutsas supplicating Indra for might, the Lord of Bays for God-sent conquest.
Make our foes ever easy to be vanquished: may we, victorious, win the spoil, O Hero.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  With precious things, O Indra, thus content us: may we attain to thine exalted favour.
Send our chiefs plenteous food with hero children. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XXVI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SOMA unpressed ne’er gladdened liberal Indra, no juices pressed without a prayer have pleased him.
I generate a laud that shall delight him, new and heroic, so that he may hear us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  At every laud the Soma gladdens Indra: pressed juices please him as each psalm is chanted,
What time the priests with one united effort call him to aid, as sons invoke their father.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These deeds he did; let him achieve new exploits, such as the priests declare at their libations.
Indra hath taken and possessed all castles, like as one common husband doth his spouses.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Even thus have they declared him. Famed is Indra as Conqueror, sole distributer of treasures;
Whose many succours come in close succession. May dear delightful benefits attend us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thus, to bring help to men, Vasiṣṭha laudeth Indra, the peoples' Hero, at libation.
Bestow upon us strength and wealth in thousands. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XXVII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MEN call on Indra in the armed encounter that he may make the hymns they sing decisive.
Hero, rejoicing in thy might, in combat give us a portion of the stall of cattle,
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Grant, Indra Maghavan, invoked of many, to these my friends the strength which thou possessest.
Thou, Maghavan, hast rent strong places open: unclose for us, Wise God, thy hidden bounty.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  King of the living world, of men, is Indra, of all in varied form that earth containeth.
Thence to the worshipper he giveth riches: may he enrich us also when we laud him.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Maghavan Indra, when we all invoke him, bountiful ever sendeth strength to aid us:
Whose perfect guerdon, never failing, bringeth wealth to the men, to friends the thing they covet.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Quick, Indra, give us room and way to riches, and let us bring thy mind to grant us treasures,
That we may win us cars and Steeds and cattle. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XXVIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  COME to our prayers, O Indra, thou who knowest: let thy Bay Steeds be yoked and guided hither.
Though mortal men on every side invoke thee, still give thine ear to us, O All-impeller.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thy greatness reacheth to our invocation, the sages' prayer which, Potent God, thou guardest.
What time thy hand, O Mighty, holds the thunder, awful in strength thou hast become resistless.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  What time thou drewest both world-halves together, like heroes led by thee who call each other-
For thou wast born for strength and high dominion-then e’en the active overthrew the sluggish.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Honour us in these present days, O Indra, for hostile men are making expiation.
Our sin that sinless Varuṇa discovered, the Wondrous-Wise hath long ago forgiven.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  We will address this liberal Lord, this Indra, that he may grant us gifts of ample riches,
Best favourer of the singer's prayer and praises. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XXIX Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THIS Soma hath been pressed for thee, O Indra: come hither, Lord of Bays, for this thou lovest.
Drink of this fair, this well-effused libation: Maghavan, give us wealth when we implore thee.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Come to us quickly with thy Bay Steeds, Hero, come to our prayer, accepting our devotion.
Enjoy thyself aright at this libation, and listen thou unto the prayers we offer.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  What satisfaction do our hymns afford thee? When, Maghavan? Now let us do thee service.
Hymns, only hymns, with love for thee, I weave thee: then hear, O Indra, these mine invocations.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They, verily, were also human beings whom thou wast wont to hear, those earlier sages.
Hence I, O Indra Maghavan, invoke thee: thou art our Providence, even as a Father.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  We will address this liberal Lord, this Indra, that he may grant us gifts of ample riches,
Best favourer of the singer's prayer and praises. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN XXX. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH power and strength, O Mighty God, approach us: be the augmenter, Indra, of these riches;
Strong Thunderer, Lord of men, for potent valour, for manly exploit and for high dominion.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thee, worth invoking, in the din of battle, heroes invoke in fray for life and sunlight.
Among all people thou art foremost fighter: give up our enemies to easy slaughter.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When fair bright days shall dawn on us, O Indra, and thou shalt bring thy banner near in battle,
Agni the Asura shall sit as Herald, calling Gods hither for our great good fortune.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thine are we, Indra, thine, both these who praise thee, and those who give rich gifts, O God and Hero.
Grant to our princes excellent protection, may they wax old and still be strong and happy.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  We will address this liberal Lord, this Indra that he may grant us gifts of ample riches:
Best favourer of the singer's prayer and praises. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
