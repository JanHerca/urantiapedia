## HYMN LXI. Uṣas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Uṣas, strong with strength, endowed witli knowledge, accept the singer's praise, O wealthy Lady.
Thou, Goddess, ancient, young, and full of wisdom, movest, all-bounteous! as the Law ordaineth.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Shine forth, O Morning, thou auspicious Goddess, on thy bright car awaking pleasant voices.
Let docile horses of far-reaching splendour convey thee hitherward, the goldencoloured.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou, Morning, turning thee to every creature, standest on high as ensign of the Immortal,
To one same goal ever and ever wending now, like a wheel, O newly-born, roll hi ther.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Letting her reins drop downward, Morning cometh, the wealthy Dame, the Lady of the dwelling;
Bringing forth light, the Wonderful, the Blessed hath spread her from the bounds of earth and heaven.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Hither invoke the radiant Goddess Morning, and bring with reverence your hymn to praise her.
She, dropping sweets, hath set in heaven her brightness, and, fair to look on, hath beamed forth her splendour.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  From heaven, with hymns, the Holy One was wakened: brightly to both worlds came the wealthy Lady.
To Morning, Agni, when she comes refulgent, thou goest forth soliciting fair riches.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  On Law's firm base the speeder of the Mornings, the Bull, hath entered mighty earth and heaven.
Great is the power of Varuṇa and Mitra, which, bright, hath spread in every place its splendour.

## HYMN LXII. Indra and Others.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YOUR well-known prompt activities aforetime needed no impulse from your faithful servant.
Where, Indra-Varuṇa, is now that glory wherewith ye brought support to those who loved you?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  This man, most diligent, seeking after riches, incessantly invokes you for your favour.
Accordant, Indra-Varuṇa, with Maruts, with Heaven and Earth, hear ye mine invocation.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, ours be this treasure ours be wealth, Maruts, with full store of heroes.
May the Varūtrīs with their shelter aid us, and Bhāratī and Hotrā with the Mornings.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Be pleased! with our oblations, thou loved of all Gods, Bṛhaspati:
Give wealth to him who brings thee gifts.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  At sacrifices, with your hymns worship the pure Bṛhaspati—
I pray for power which none may bend—
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The Bull of men, whom none deceive, the wearer of each shape at will,
Bṛhaspati Most Excellent.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Divine, resplendent Pūṣan, this our newest hymn of eulogy,
By us is chanted forth to thee.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Accept with favour this my song, be gracious to the earnest thought,
Even as a bridegroom to his bride.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  May he who sees all living things, see, them together at a glance,—
May he, may Pūṣan be our help.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the God:
So May he stimulate our prayers.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  With understanding, earnestly, of Savitar the God we crave
Our portion of prosperity.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Men, singers worship Savitar the God with hymn and holy rites,
Urged by the impulse of their thoughts.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Soma who gives success goes forth, goes to the gathering place of Gods,
To seat him at the seat of Law.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  To us and to our cattle may Soma give salutary food,
To biped and to quadruped.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  May Soma, strengthening our power of life, and conquering our foes,
In our assembly take his seat.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  May Mitra-Varuṇa, sapient Pair, bedew our pasturage with oil,
With meatb the regions of the air.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Far-ruling, joyful when adored, ye reign through majesty of might,
With pure laws everlastingly.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Lauded by Jamadagni's song, sit in the place of holy Law:
