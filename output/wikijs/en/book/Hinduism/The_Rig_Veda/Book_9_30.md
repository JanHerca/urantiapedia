## HYMN XXI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To Indra flow these running drops, these Somas frolicsome in mood.
Exhilarating, finding light;
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Driving off foes, bestowing room upon the presser, willingly
Bringing their praiser vitalforce.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Lightly disporting them, the drops flow to one common reservoir,
And fall into the river's wave.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These Pavamanas have obtained all blessings much to be desired,
Like coursers harnessed to a car.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  With view to us, O Soma-drops, bestow his manifold desire
On him who yet hath given us naught.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Bring us our wish with this design, as a wright brings his new-wrought wheel:
Flow pure and shining with the stream.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  These drops have cried with resonant voice: like swift steeds they have run the course,
And roused the good man's hymn to life.

## HYMN XXII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THESE rapid Soma-streams have stirred themselves to motion like strong steeds,
Like cars, like armies hurried forth.

The flickering flames of burning fire.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These Soma juices, blent with curds, purified, skilled in sacred hymns,
Have gained by song their hearts'desire.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Immortal, cleansed, these drops, since first they flowed, have never wearied, fain
To reach the regions and their paths.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Advancing they have travelled o’er the ridges of the earth and heaven,
And this the highest realm of all.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Over the heights have they attained the highest thread that is spun out,
And this which must be deemed most high.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou, Soma, boldest wealth in kine which thou hast seized from niggard churls:
Thou calledst forth the outspun thread.

## HYMN XXIII. Soma Pavamana.

For sacred lore of every kind.

They made the Sun that he might shine.

And give us food with progeny.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The living Somas being cleansed diffuse exhilarating drink,
Turned to the vat which drips with meath.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Soma gows on intelligent, possessing sap and mighty strength,
Brave Hero who repels the curse.
