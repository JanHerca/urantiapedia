## HYMN I. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THOU, first inventor of this prayer, O Agni, Worker of Marvels, hast become our Herald.
Thou, Bull, hast made us strength which none may conquer, strength that shall overcome all other prowess.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As Priest thou sattest at the seat of worship, furthering us, best Offerer, meet for honour.
So first to thee have pious men resorted, turning thy mind to thoughts of ample riches.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In thee, still watching, they have followed riches, who goest with much wealth as with an army,
The radiant Agni, lofty, fair to look on, worshipped with marrow, evermore resplendent.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They who approached the God's abode with homage, eager for glory, won them perfect glory:
Yea, they gained even sacrificial titles, and found delight in thine auspicious aspect.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  On earth the people magnify thee greatly, thee their celestial and terrestrial riches.
Thou, Helper, must be known as our Preserver, Father and Mother of mankind for ever.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Dear priest among mankind, adorable Agni hath seated him, joy-giver, skilled in worship.
Let us approach thee shining in thy dwelling, kneeling upon our knees, with adoration.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Longing for bliss, pure-minded, God-devoted, Agni, we seek thee, such, meet to be lauded.
Thou, Agni, leddest forth our men to battle, refulgent with the heaven's exalted splendour.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Sage of mankind, all peoples' Lord and Master, the Bull of men, the sender down of blessings,
Still pressing on, promoting, purifying, Agni the Holy One, the Lord of riches.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Agni, the mortal who hath toiled and worshipped, brought thee oblations with his kindled fuel,
And well knows sacrifice with adoration, gains every joy with thee to guard and help him.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Mightily let us worship thee the Mighty, with reverence, Agni! fuel and oblations,
With songs, O Son of Strength, with hymns, with altar: so may we strive for thine auspicious favour.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou who hast covered heaven and earth with splendour and with thy glories, glorious and triumphant.
Continue thou to shine on us, O Agni, with strength abundant, rich, and long enduring.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Vouchsafe us ever, as man needs, O Vasu, abundant wealth of kine for son and offspring.
Food noble, plenteous, far from sin and evil, he with us, and fair fame to make us happy.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  May I obtain much wealth in many places by love of thee and through thy grace, King Agni;
For in thee Bounteous One, in thee the Sovran, Agni, are many boons for him who serves thee.

## HYMN II. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THOU, Agni, even as Mitra, hast a princely glory of thine own.
Thou, active Vasu, makest fame increase like full prosperity.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For, verily, men pray to thee with sacrifices and with songs.
To thee the Friendly Courser, seen of all, comes speeding through the air.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Of one accord men kindle thee Heaven's signal of the sacrifice,
When, craving bliss, this race of man invites thee to the solemn rite.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Let the man thrive who travails sore, in prayer, far thee the Bountiful.
He with the help of lofty Dyaus comes safe through straits of enmity.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The mortal who with fuel lights thy flame and offers unto thee,
Supports a house with many a branch, Agni, to live a hundred years.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thy bright smoke lifts itself aloft, and far-extended shines in heaven.
For, Purifier! like the Sun thou beamest with thy radiant glow.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For in men's houses thou must be glorified as a well-loved guest,
Gay like an elder in a fort, claiming protection like a son.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou, Agni, like an able steed, art urged by wisdom in the wood.
Thou art like wind; food, home art thou, like a young horse that runs astray.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  E’en things imperishable, thou, O Agni, like a gazing ox,
Eatest, when hosts, Eternal One! of thee the Mighty rend the woods.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Agni, thou enterest as Priest the home of men who sacrifice.
Lord of the people, prosper them. Accept the ofrering, Aṅgiras!
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Agni, God with Mitra's might, call hither the favour of the Gods from earth and heaven.
Bring weal from heaven, that men may dwell securely. May we o’ercome the foe's malign oppressions, may we o’ercome them, through thy help o’ercome them.

## HYMN III. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  TRUE, guardian of the Law, thy faithful servant wins ample light and dwells in peace, O Agni,
Whom thou, as Varuṇa in accord with Mitra, guardest, O God, by banishing his trouble.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He hath paid sacrifices, toiled in worship, and offered gifts to wealth-increasing Agni.
Him the displeasure of the famous moves not, outrage and scorn affect not such a mortal.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bright God, whose look is free from stain like Sūrya's, thou, swift, what time thou earnestly desirest,
Hast gear to give us. Come with joy at evening, where, Child of Wood, thou mayest also tarry.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Fierce is his gait and vast his wondrous body: he champeth like a horse with bit and bridle,
And, darting forth his tongue, as ’twere a hatchet, burning the woods, smelteth them like a smelter.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Archer-like, fain toshoot, he sets his arrow, and whets his splendour like the edge of iron:
The messenger of night with brilliant pathway, like a tree-roosting bird of rapid pinion.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In beams of morn he clothes him like the singer, and bright as Mitra with his splendour crackles.
Red in the night, by day the men's possession: red, he belongs to men by day, Immortal.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Like Heaven's when scattering beams his voice was uttered: among the plants the radiant Hero shouted,
Who with his glow in rapid course came hither to fill both worlds, well-wedded Dames, with treasure.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Who, with supporting streams and rays that suit him, hath flashed like lightning with his native vigour.
Like the deft Maker of the band of Maruts, the bright impetuous One hath shone refulgent.

## HYMN IV Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As at man's service of the Gods, Invoker, thou, Son of Strength, dost sacrifice and worship,
So bring for us to-day all Gods together, bring willingly the willing Gods, O Agni.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May Agni, radiant Herald of the morning, meet to be known, accept our praise with favour.
Dear to all life, mid mortal men Immortal, our guest, awake at dawn, is Jātavedas.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whose might the very heavens regard with wonder: bright as the Sun he clothes himself with lustre.
He who sends forth,, Eternal Purifier, hath shattered e’en the ancient works of Aśna.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou art a Singer, Son! our feast-companion: Agni at birth prepared his food and pathway.
Therefore vouchsafe us strength, O Strength-bestower. Win like a King: foes trouble not thy dwelling.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Even he who cats his firm hard food with swiftness,and overtakes the nights as Vāyu kingdoms.
May we o’ercome those who resist thine orders, like a steed casting down the flying foemen.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Like Sūrya with his fulgent rays, O Agni, thou overspreadest both the worlds with splendour.
Decked with bright colour he dispels the darkness, like Auśija, with clear flame swifily flying.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  We have elected thee as most delightful for thy beams' glow: hear our great laud, O Agni.
The best men praise thee as the peer of Indra in strength, mid Gods, like Viyu in thy bounty.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Now, Agni, on the tranquil paths of riches come to us for our weal: save us from sorrow.
Grant chiefs and bard this boon. May we live happy, with hero children, through a hundred winters.

## HYMN V. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I INVOCATE your Son of Strength, the Youthful, with hymns, the Youngest God, whose speech is guileless;
Sage who sends wealth comprising every treasure, bringer of many boons, devoid of malice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  At eve and morn thy pious servants bring thee their precious gifts, O Priest of many aspects,
On whom, the Purifier, all things living as on firm. ground their happiness have stablished.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou from of old hast dwelt among these people, by mental power the charioteer of blessings.
Hence sendest thou, O sapient Jātavedas, to him who serves thee treasures in succession.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni, whoever secretly attacks us, the neighbour, thou with Mitra's might! who harms us,
Burn him with thine own Steers for ever youthful, burning with burning heat, thou fiercest burner.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He who serves thee with sacrifice and fuel, with hymn, O Son of Strength, and chanted praises,
Shines out, Immortal! in the midst of mortals, a sage, with wealth, with splendour and with glory.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Do this, O Agni, when we urge thee, quickly, triumphant in thy might subdue our foemen.
When thou art praised with words and decked with brightness, accept this chanted hymn, the singer's worship.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Help us, that we may gain this wish, O Agni, gain riches, Wealthy One! with store of heroes.
Desiring strength from thee may we be strengthened, and win, Eternal! thine eternal glory.

## HYMN VI. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HE who seeks furtherance and grace to help him goes to the Son of Strength with newest worship,
Calling the heavenly Priest to share the banquet, who rends the wood, bright, with his blackened pathway.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  White-hued and thundering he dwells in splendour, Most Youthful, with the loudvoiced and eternal-
Agni, most variform, the Purifier, who follows crunching many ample forests.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Incited by the wind thy flames, O Agni, move onward, Pure One! pure, in all directions.
Thy most destructive heavenly Navagvas break the woods down and devastate them boldly.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thy pure white horses from their bonds are loosened: O Radiant One, they shear the ground beneath them,
And far and wide shines out thy flame, and flickers rapidly moving over earth's high ridges.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Forth darts the Bull's tongue like the sharp stone weapon discharged by him who fights to win the cattle.
Agni's fierce flame is like a hero's onset: dread and resistless he destroys the forests.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou with the sunlight of the great Impeller hast boldly over-spread the earth's expanses.
So drive away with conquering might all perils. fighting out foemen burn up those who harm us.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Wondrous! of wondrous power! give to the singer wealth wondrous, marked, most wonderful, life-giving.
Wealth bright, O Bright One, vast, with many heroes, give with thy bright flames to the man who lauds thee.

## HYMN VII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Him, messenger of earth and head of heaven, Agni Vaiśvānara, born in holy Order,
The Sage, the King, the guest of men, a vessel fit for their mouths, the Gods have generated.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Him have they praised, mid-point of sacrifices, great cistern of libations, seat of riches.
Vaiśvānara, conveyer of oblations, ensign of worship, have the Gods engendered.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  From thee, O Agni, springs the mighty singer, from thee come heroes who subdue the foeman.
O King, Vaiśvānara, bestow thou on us excellent treasures worthy to belonged fo r.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To thee, Immortal! when to life thou springest, all the Gods sing for joy as to their infant.
They by thy mental powers were made immortal, Vaiśvānara, when thou shonest from thy Parents.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Agni Vaiśvānara, no one hath ever resisted these thy mighty ordinances,
When thou, arising from thy Parents' bosom, foundest the light for days' appointed courses.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The summits of the heaven are traversed through and through by the Immortal's light, Vaiśvānara's brilliancy.
All creatures in existence rest upon his head. The Seven swift-flowing Streams have grown like branches forth,
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Vaiśvānara, who measured out the realms of air, Sage very wise who made the lucid spheres of heaven,
The Undeceivable who spread out all the worlds, keeper is he and guard of immortality.

## HYMN VIII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AT Jātavedas' holy gathering I will tell aloud the conquering might of the swift red-hued Steer.
A pure and fresher hymn flows to Vaiśvānara, even as for Agni lovely Soma is made pure.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  That Agni, when in loftiest heaven he sprang to life, Guardian of Holy Laws, kept and observed them well.
Exceeding wise, he measured out the firmament. Vaiśvānara attained to heaven by mightiness.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wonderful Mitra propped the heaven and earth apart, and covered and concealed
the darkness with his light.
He made the two bowls part asunder like two skins. Vaiśvānara put forth all his creative power.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The Migbty seized him in the bosom of the floods: the people waited on the King who should be praised.
As envoy of Vivasvān MatariSvan brought Agni Vaiśvānara hither from far away.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  In every age bestow upon the singers wealth, worthy of holy synods, glorious, ever new.
King, undecaying, as it were with sharpened bolt, smite down the sinner like a tree with lightning-flash.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Do thou bestow, O Agni, on our wealthy chiefs, rule, with good heroes, undecaying, bending not.
So may we win for us strength. O Vaiśvānara, hundredfold, thousandfold, O Agni, by thy help.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O thou who dwellest in three places, Helper, keep with effective guards our princely patrons.
Keep our band, Agni, who have brought thee presents. Lengthen their lives, Vaiśvānara, when lauded.

## HYMN IX. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ONE half of day is dark, and bright the other: both atmospheres move on by sage devices.
Agni Vaiśvānara, when born as Sovran, hath with his lustre overcome the darkness.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I know not either warp or woof, I know not the web they weave when moving to the contest.
Whose son shall here speak words that must be spoken without assistance from the Father near him?
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For both the warp and woof he understandeth, and in due time shall speak what should be spoken,
Who knoweth as the immortal world's Protector, descending, seeing with no aid from other.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He is the Priest, the first of all: behold him. Mid mortal men he is the light immortal.
Here was he born, firm-seated in his station Immortal, ever waxing in his body.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  A firm light hath been set for men to look on: among all things that fly the mind is swiftest.
All Gods of one accord, with one intention, move unobstructed to a single purpose.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Mine ears unclose to hear, mine eye to see him; the light that harbours in my spirit broadens.
Far roams my mind whose thoughts are in the distance. What shall I speak, what shall I now imagine?
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  All the Gods bowed them down in fear before thee, Agni, when thou wast dwelling in the darkness.
Vaiśvānara be gracious to assist us, may the Immortal favour us and help us.

## HYMN X. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INSTALL at sacrifice, while the rite advances, your pleasant, heavenly Agni, meet for praises.
With hymns-for he illumines us-install him. He, Jātavedas, makes our rites successful.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hear this laud, Radiant Priest of many aspects, O Agni with the fires of man enkindled,
Laud which bards send forth pure as sacred butter, strength to this man, as ’twere for self-advantage.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Mid mortal men that singer thrives in glory who offers gifts with hymns of praise to Agni,
And the God, wondrous bright, with wondrous succours helps him to win a stable filled with cattle.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He, at his birth, whose path is black behind him, filled heaven and earth with far-apparent splendour:
And he himself hath been. through night's thick darkness, made manifest by light, the Purifier.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  With thy most mighty aid, confer, O Agni, wonderful wealth on us and on our princes,
Who stand preeminent, surpassing others in liberal gifts, in fame, and hero virtues.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Agni, accept this sacrifice with gladness, which, seated here, the worshipper presenteth.
Fair hymns hadst thou among the Bharadvājas, and holpest them to gain abundant vigour.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Scatter our foes, increase our store. May we he glad a hundred winters with brave sons.
