## HYMN LXXI. Soma Pavamana,

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE guerdon is bestowed: the Mighty takes his Seat, and, ever-Watchful, guards from fiend and evil sprite.
Gold-hued, he makes the cloud his diadem, the milk his carpet in both worlds, and prayer his robe of state.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Strong, bellowing, he goes, like one who slays the folk; he lets this hue of Asuras flow off from him,
Throws off his covering, seeks his father's meeting-place, and thus makes for himself the bright robe he assumes.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Onward he flows, from both the hands, pressed out with stones: excited by the prayer, the water makes him wild.
He frolics and draws near, completes his work with song, and bathes in streams to satisfy the worshipper.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They pour out meath around the Master of the house, Celestial Strengthener of the mountain that gives might;
In whom, through his great powers, oblation-eating cows in their uplifted udder mix their choicest milk.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They, the ten sisters, on the lap of Aditi, have sent him forward like a car from both the arms.
He wanders and comes near the Cow's mysterious place, even the place which his inventions have produced.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Like as a falcon to his home, so speeds the God to his own golden wisely-tashioned place to rest.
With song they urge the darling to the sacred grass: the Holy One goes like a courser to the Gods.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  From far away, from heaven, the redhued noted Sage, Steer of the triple height, hath sung unto the kine.
With thousand guidings he, leading this way and that, shines, as a singer, splendidly through many a morn.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  His covering assumes a radiant hue; where’er he comes into the fight he drives the foe afar.
The Winner of the Floods, with food he seeks the host of heaven, he comes to praises glorified with milk.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Like a bull roaming round the herds he bellows: he hath assumed the brilliancy of Sūrya.
Down to the earth hath looked the heavenly Falcon: Soma with wisdom views all living creatures.

## HYMN LXXII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEY cleanse the Gold-hued: like a red Steed is he yoked, and Soma in the jar is mingled with the milk.
He sendeth out his voice, and many loving friends of him the highly lauded hasten with their songs.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The many sages utter words in unison, while into Indra's throat they pour the Soma juice,
When, with the ten that dwell together closely joined, the men whose hands are skilful cleanse the lovely meath.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He goes upon his way, unresting, to the cows, over the roaring sound which Sarya's Daughter loves.
The Falcon brought it to him for his own delight: now with the twofold kindred sisters is his home.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Washed by the men, stone-pressed, dear on the holy grass, faithful to seasons, Lord of cattle from of old,
Most liberal, completing sacrifice for men, O Indra, pure bright Soma, Indu, flows for thee.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Indra, urged by arms of men and poured in streams, Soma flows on for thee afterḥis Godlike kind.
Plans thou fulfillest, gatherest thoughts for sacrifice: in the bowls sits the Gold-hued like a roosting bird.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Sages well-skilled in work, intelligent, drain out the stalk that roars, the Sage, the Everlasting One.
The milk, the hymns unite them with him in the place of sacrifice, his seat who is produced anew.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Earth's central point, sustainer of the mighty heavens, distilled into the streams, into the waters' wave,
As Indra's thunderbolt, Steer with farspreading wealth, Soma is flowing on to make the heart rejoice.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Over the earthly region flow thou on thy way, helping the praiser and the pourer, thou Most Wise.
Let us not lack rich treasure reaching to our home, and may we clothe ourselves in manifold bright wealth.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Hither, O Indu, unto us a hundred gifts of steeds, a thousand gifts of cattle and of gold,
Measure thou forth, yea, splendid ample strengthening food do thou, O Pavamana, heed this laud of ours.

## HYMN LXXIII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEY from the spouting drop have sounded at the rim: naves speed together to the place of sacrifice.
That Asura hath formed, to seize, three lofty heights. The ships of truth have borne the pious man across.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The strong Steers, gathering, have duly stirred themselves,and over the stream's wave the friends sent forth the song.
Engendering the hymn, with flowing streams of meath, Indra's dear body have they caused to wax in strength.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With sanctifying gear they sit around the song: their ancient Father guards their holy work from harm.
Varuṇa hath o’erspread the mighty sea of air. Sages had power to hold him in sustaining floods.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Sweet-tongued, exhaustless, they have sent their voices down togetlier, in heaven's vault that pours a thousand streams.
His wildly-restless warders never close an eye: in every place are found the bonds that bind man last.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O'er Sire and Mother they have roared in unison bright with the verse of praise, burning up riteless men,
Blowing away with supernatural might from earth and from the heavens the swarthy skin which Indra hates.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Those which, as guides of song and counsellors of speed, were manifested from their ancient dwelling place,—
From these the eyeless and the deaf have turned aside: the wicked travel not the pathway of the Law.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  What time the filter with a thousand streams is stretched, the thoughtful sages purify their song therein.
Bright-coloured are their spies, vigorous, void of guile, excellent, fair to see, beholders of mankind.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Guardian of Law, most wise, he may not be deceived: three Purifiers hath he set within his heart.
With wisdom he beholds all creatures that exist: he drives into the pit the hated riteliess ones.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The thread of sacrifice spun in the cleansing sieve, on Varuṇa's tongue-tip, by supernatural might,—
This, by their striving, have the prudent ones attained: he who hath not this power shall sink into the pit.

## HYMN LXXIV. Soma Pavamana

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BORN like a youngling he hath clamoured in the wood, when he, the Red, the Strong, would win the light of heaven.
He comes with heavenly seed that makes the water swell: him for wide-spreading shelter we implore with prayer.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled full, moves itself every way.
He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage holds these who move! together and all food.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wide space hath he who follows Aditi's right path, and mighty, well-made food, meath blent with Soma juice;
He who from hence commands the rain, Steer of the kine, Leader of floods, who helps us hence, who claims our laud.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Butter and milk are drawn from animated cloud; thence Amṛta is produced, centre of sacrifice.
Hini the Most Bounteous Ones, ever united, love; him as ouir Friend the Men who make all swell rain down.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The Soma-stalk hath roared, following with the wave: he swells with sap for man the skin which Gods enjoy.
Upon the lap of Aditi he lays the germ, by means whereof we gain children and progeny.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In the third region which distils a thousand streams, may the Exhaustless Ones descend with procreant power.
The kindred Four have been sent downward from the heavens: dropping with oil they bring Amṛta and sacred gifts.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Soma assumes white colour when he strives to gain: the bounteous Asura knows full many a precious boon.
Down the steep slope, through song, he comes to sacrifice, and he will burst the water-holding cask of heaven,
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Yea, to the shining milk-anointed beaker, as to his goal, hath stepped the conquering Courser.
Pious-souled men have sent their giffi of cattle unto Kakṣīvān of the hundred winters.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Soma, thy juice when thou art blended with the streams, flows, Pavamana, through the long wool of the sheep.
So, cleansed by sages. O best giver of delight, grow sweet for Indra, Pavamana! for his drink.

## HYMN LXXV. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  GRACIOUSLY-MINDED he is flowing on his way to win dear names o’er which the Youthful One grows great.
The Mighty and Far-seeing One hath mounted now the mighty Sūrya's car which moves to every side.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Speaker, unassailable Master of this hymn, the Tongue of sacrifice pours forth the pleasant meath.
Within the lustrous region of the heavens the Son makes the third secret name of Mother and of Sire.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Sending forth flashes he hath bellowed to the jars, led by the men into the golden reservoir.
The milky streams of sacrifice have sung to him: he of the triple height shines brightly through the morns.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Pressed by the stones, with hymns, and graciously inclined, illuminating both the Parents, Heaven and Earth,
He flows in ordered season onward through the flee, a current of sweet juice still swelling day by day.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Flow onward, Soma, flow to bring prosperity: cleansed by the men, invest thee with the milky draught.
What gladdening drinks thou hast, foaming, exceeding strong, even with these incite Indra to give us wealth.

## HYMN LXXVI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ON flows the potent juice, sustainer of the heavens, the strength of Gods, whom men must hail with shouts of joy.
The Gold-hued, started like a courser by brave men, impetuously winneth splendour in the streams.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He takes his weapons, like a hero, in his hands, fain to win light, car-borne, in forays for the kine.
Indu, while stimulating India's might, is urged forward and balmed by sages skilful in their task.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Soma, as thou art purified with flowing wave, exhibiting thy strength enter thou Indra's throat.
Make both worlds stream for us, as lightning doth the clouds: mete out exhaustless powers for us, as ’twere through song.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Onward he flows, the King of all that sees the light: the Ṛṣis’ Lord hath raised the song of sacrifice;
Even he who is adorned with Sūrya's arrowy beam, Father of hymns, whose wisdom is beyond our reach.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Like as a bull to herds, thou flowest to the pail, bellowing as a steer upon the water's lap.
So, best of Cheerers, thou for Indra flowest on that we, with thy protection, may o’ercome in fight.

## HYMN LXXVII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MORE beauteous than the beautiful, as Indra's bolt, this Soma, rich in sweets, hath clamoured in the vat.
Dropping with oil, abundant, streams of sacrifice flow unto him like milch-kine, lowing, with their milk.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  On flows that Ancient One whom, hitherward, from heaven, sped through the region of the air, the Falcon snatched.
He, quivering with alarm and terrified in heart before bow-armed Kṛśānu, holdeth fast the sweet.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May those first freshest drops of Soma juice effused flow on, their way to bring us mighty strength in kine.
Beauteous as serpents, worthy to be looked upon, they whom each sacred gift and all our prayers have pleased.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May that much-lauded Indu, with a heart inclined to us, well-knowing, fight against our enemies.
He who hath brought the germ beside the Strong One's seat moves onward to the widely-opcned stall of kine.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The active potent juice of heaven is flowing on, great Varuṇa whom the forward man can ne’er deceive.
Mitra, the Holy, hath been pressed for troubled times, neighing like an impatient horse amid the herd,

## HYMN LXXVIII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  RAISING his voice the King hath flowed upon his way: invested with the waters he would win the kine.
The fleece retains his solid parts as though impure, and bright and cleansed he seeks the special place of Gods.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou, Soma, art effused for Indra by the men, balmed in the wood as wave, Sage, Viewer of mankind.
Full many are the paths whereon thou mayest go: a thousand bay steeds hast thou resting in the bowls.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Apsarases who dwell in waters of the sea, sitting within, have flowed to Soma wise of heart.
They urge the Master of the house upon his way, and to the Eternal Pavamana pray for bliss.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Soma flows on for u's as winner of the kine, winner of thousands, cars, water, and light, and gold;
He whom the Gods have made a gladdening draught to drink, the drop most sweet to taste, weal-bringing, red of hue.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Soma, as Pavamana thou, our faithful Friend, making for us these real treasures, flowest on.
Slay thou the enemy both near and,far away: grant us security and ample pasturage.

## HYMN LXXIX. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SPONTANEOUS let our drops of Soma juice flow on, pressed, golden-hued, among the Gods of lofty heaven.
Perish among us they who give no gifts of food! perish the godless! May our prayers obtain success.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Forward to us the drops, distilling meath, shall flow, like riches for whose sake we urge the horses on.
Beyond the crafty hindering of all mortal men may we continually bear precious wealth away.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yea, yerily, foe of hate shown to himself is he, yea, verity, destroyer too of other hate.
As thirst subdueth in the desert, conquer thou, O Soma Pavarnana, men of evil thoughts.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Near kin to thee is he, raised loftiest in the heavens: upon the earth's high ridge thy scions have grown forth.
The press-stones chew and crunch thee on the ox's hide: sages have milked thee with their hands into the streams.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So do they hurry on thy strong and beauteous juice, O Indu, as the first ingredient of the draught.
Bring low, thou Pavamana, every single foe, and be thy might shown forth as sweet and gladdening drink.

## HYMN LXXX. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ON flows the stream of Soma who beholds mankind: by everlasting Law he calls the Gods from heaven.
He lightens with the roaring of Br aspati: h the lakes have not contained the pourings of juice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou, powerful Soma, thou to whom the cows have -lowed, ascendest bright with sheen, thine iron-fashioned home.
Thou, lengthening our princes' life and high renown, flowest for Indra as his might to gladdening drink.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Best giver of delight, he flows to Indra's throat, robing himself in might, Auspicious One, for fame.
He spreads himself abroad to meet all things that be: the vigorous Tawny Steed flows sporting on his way.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The men, the ten swift fingers, milk thee out for Gods, even thee most rich in meath, with thousand flowing streams.
Soma who winnest thousands, driven by the men, expressed with stones, bring, as thou flowest, all the Gods.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Deft-handed men with stones, the ten swift fingers, drain thee into waters, thee, the Steer enriched with sweets.
Thou, Soma, gladdening Indra, and the Heavenly Host, flowest as Pavamana like a river's wave.
