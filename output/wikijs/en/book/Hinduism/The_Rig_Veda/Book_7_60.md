## HYMN LI. Ādityas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THROUGH the Ādityas’ most auspicious shelter, through their most recent succour may we conquer.
May they, the Mighty, giving ear, establish this sacrifice, to make us free and sinless.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let Aditi rejoice and the Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, most righteous.
May they, the Guardians of the world, protect us, and, to show favour, drink this day our Soma.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  All Universal Deities, the Maruts, all the Ādityas, yea, and all the Ṛbhus,
Indra, and Agni, and the Aśvins, lauded. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN LII. Ādityas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY we be free from every bond, Ādityas! a castle among Gods and men, ye Vasus.
Winning, may we win Varuṇa and Mitra, and, being, may we be, O Earth and Heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May Varuṇa and Mitra grant this blessing, our Guardians, shelter to our seed and offspring.
Let us not suffer for another's trespass. nor do the thing that ye, O Vasus, punish.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The ever-prompt Aṅgirases, imploring riches from Savitar the God, obtained them.
So may our Father who is great and holy, and all the Gods, accordant, grant this favour.

## HYMN LIII. Heaven and Earth.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AS priest with solemn rites and adorations I worship Heaven and Earth, the High and Holy.
To them, great Parents of the Gods, have sages of ancient time, singing, assigned precedence.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With newest hymns set in the seat of Order, those the Two Parents, born before all others,
Come, Heaven and Earth, with the Celestial People, hither to us, for strong is your protection.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yea, Heaven and Earth, ye hold in your possession full many a treasure for the liberal giver.
Grant us that wealth which comes in free abundance. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN LIV. Vastospati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ACKNOWLEDGE us, O Guardian of the Homestead: bring no disease, and give us happy entrance.
Whate’er we ask of thee, be pleased to grant it, and prosper thou quadrupeds and bipeds.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Protector of the Home, be our promoter: increase our wealth in kine and steeds, O Indu.
May we be ever-youthful in thy friendship: be pleased in us as in his sons a father.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Through thy dear fellowship that bringeth welfare, may we be victors, Guardian of the Dwelling!
Protect our happiness in rest and labour. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN LV. Vastospati.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  VASTOSPATI, who killest all disease and wearest every form,
Be an auspicious Friend to us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When, O bright Son of Saramā, thou showest, tawny-hued! thy teeth,
They gleam like lances' points within thy mouth when thou wouldst bite; go thou to steep.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Saramā's Son, retrace thy way: bark at the robber and the thief.
At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dust thou seek to terrify us? Go to sleep.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Be on thy guard against the boar, and let the boar beware of thee.
At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dost thou seek to terrify us? Go to sleep.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Sleep mother, let the father sleep, sleep dog and master of the house.
Let all the kinsmen sleep, sleep all the people who are round about.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The man who sits, the man who walks, and whosoever looks on us,
Of these we closely shut the eyes, even as we closely shut this house.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The Bull who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea,—
By him the Strong and Mighty One we lull and make the people sleep.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The women sleeping in the court, lying without, or stretched on beds,
The matrons with their odorous sweetsthese, one and all, we lull to sleep.

## HYMN LVI. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Wno are these radiant men in serried rank, Rudra's young heroes borne by noble steeds?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Verily no one knoweth whence they sprang: they, and they only, know each other's birth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They strew each other with their blasts, these Hawks: they strove together, roaring like the wind.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  A sage was he who knew these mysteries, what in her udder mighty Pṛśni bore.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ever victorious, through the Maruts, be this band of Heroes, nursing manly strength,
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Most bright in splendour, flectest on their way, close-knit to glory, strong with varied power.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yea, mighty is your power and firm your strength: so, potent, with the Maruts, be the band.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Bright is your spirit, wrathful are your minds: your bold troop's minstrel is like one inspired.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ever avert your blazing shaft from us, and let not your displeasure reach us here
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Your dear names, conquering Maruts, we invoke, calling aloud till we are satisfied.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Well-armed, impetuous in their haste, they deck themselves, their forms, with oblations: to you, the pure, ornaments made of gold.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Pure, Maruts, pure yourselves, are your oblations: to you, the pure, pure sacrifice I offer.
By Law they came to truth, the Law's observers, bright by their birth, and pure, and sanctifying.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Your rings, O Maruts, rest upon your shoulders, and chains of gold are twined upon your bosoms.
Gleaming with drops of rain, like lightning-flashes, after your wont ye whirl about your weapons.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Wide in the depth of air spread forth your glories, far, most adorable, ye bear your titles.
Maruts, accept this thousandfold allotment of household sacrifice and household treasure.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If, Maruts, ye regard the praise recited here at this mighty singer invocation,
Vouchsafe us quickly wealth with noble heroes, wealth which no man uho hateth us may injure.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The Maruts, fleet as coursers, while they deck them like youths spectators of a festal meeting,
Linger, like beauteous colts, about the dwelling, like frisking calves, these who pour down the water.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  So may the Maruts help us and be gracious, bringing free room to lovely Earth and Heaven.
Far be your bolt that slayeth men and cattle. Ye Vasus, turn yourselves to us with blessings.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The priest, when seated, loudly calls you, Maruts, praising in song your universal bounty.
He, Bulls! who hath so much in his possession, free from duplicity, with hymns invokes you.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  These Maruts bring the swift man to a stand-still, and strength with mightier strength they break and humble
These guard the singer from the man who hates him and lay their sore displeasure on the wicked.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  These Maruts rouse even the poor and needy: the Vasus love him as an active champion.
Drive to a distance, O ye Bulls, the darkness: give us full store of children and descendants.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Never, O Maruts, may we lose your bounty, nor, car-borne Lords! be hitidmost when ye deal it.
Give us a share in that delightful treasure, the genuine wealth that, Bulls! is your possession.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  What time the men in fury rush together for running streams, for pastures, and for houses.
Then, O ye Maruts, ye who spring from Rudra, be our protectors in the strife with foemen.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Full many a deed ye did for our forefathers worthy of lauds which, even of old, they sang you.
lle strong man, with the Maruts, wins in battle, the charger, with the Maruts, gains the booty.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Ours, O ye Maruts, be the vigorous Hero, the Lord Divine of men, the strong Sustainer,
With whom to fair lands we may cross the waters, and dwell in our own home with you beside us.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  May Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni, Waters, and Plants, and Trees accept our praises.
May we find shelter in the Marut's bosom. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN LVII. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YEA, through the power of your sweet juice, ye Holy! the Marut host is glad at sacrifices.
They cause even spacious heaven and earth to tremble, they make the spring flow when they come, the Mighty.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Maruts watch the man who sings their praises, promoters of the thought of him who worships.
Seat you on sacred grass in our assembly, this day, with friendly minds, to share the banquet.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  No others gleam so brightly as these Maruts with their own forms, their golden gauds, their weapons.
With all adornments, decking earth and heaven, they heighten, for bright show, their common splendour.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Far from us be your blazing dart, O Maruts, when we, through human frailty, sin against you.
Let us not he exposed to that, ye Holy! May your most loving favour still attend us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May even what we have done delight the Maruts, the blameless Ones, the bright, the purifying.
Further us, O ye Holy, with your kindness: advance us mightily that we may prosper.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And may the Maruts, praised by all their titles, Heroes, enjoy the taste of our oblations.
Give us of Amṛta for the sake of offspring: awake the excellent fair stores of riches.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Hither, ye Maruts, praised, with all your succours, with all felicity come to our princes,
Who, of themselves, a hundredfold increase us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN LVIII. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SING to the troop that pours down rain in common, the Mighty Company of celestial nature.
They make the world-halves tremble with their greatness: from depths of earth and sky they reach to heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Yea, your birth, Maruts, was with wild commotion, ye who move swiftly, fierce in wrath, terrific.
Ye all-surpassing in your might and vigour, each looker on the light fears at your coming.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Give ample vital power unto our princes let our fair praises gratify the Maruts.
As the way travelled helpeth people onward, so further us with your delightful succours.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Your favoured singer counts his wealth by hundreds: the strong steed whom ye favour wins a thousand.
The Sovran whom ye aid destroys the foeman. May this your gift, ye Shakers, be distinguished.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I call, as such, the Sons of bounteous Rudra: will not the Maruts turn again to us-ward?
What secret sin or open stirs their anger, that we implore the Swift Ones to forgive us.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  This eulogy of the Bounteous hath been spoken: accept, ye Maruts, this our hymn of praises.
Ye Bulls, keep those who hate us at a distance. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN LIX. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHOMSO ye rescue here and there, whomso ye guide, O Deities,
To him give shelter, Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa, ye Maruts, and thou Aryaman.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Through your kind favour, Gods, on some auspicious day, the worshipper subdues his foes.
That man increases home and strengthening ample food who brings you offerings as ye list.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Vasiṣṭha will not overlook the lowliest one among you all.
O Maruts, of our Soma juice effused to-day drink all of you with eager haste.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Your succour in the battle injures not the man to whom ye, Heroes, grant your gifts.
May your most recent favour turn to us again. Come quickly, ye who fain would drink.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Come hitherward to drink the juice, O ye whose bounties give you joy.
These offerings are for you, these, Maruts, I present. Go not to any place but this.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Sit on our sacred grass, be graciously inclined to give the wealth for which we long,
To take delight, ye Maruts, Friends of all, with Svāhā, in sweet Soma juice.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Decking the beauty of their forms in secret the Swans with purple backs have flown down hither.
Around me all the Company hath settled, like joyous Heroes glad in our libation.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Maruts, the man whose wrath is hard to master, he who would slay us ere we think, O Vasus,
May he be tangled in the toils of mischief; smite ye him down with your most flaming weapon.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Maruts, ye consuming Gods, enjoy this offering brought for you,
To help us, ye who slay the foe.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Sharers of household sacrifice, come, Maruts, stay not far away,
That ye may help us, Bounteous Ones.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Here, Self-strong Maruts, yea, even here. ye Sages with your sunbright skins
I dedicate your sacrifice.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Tryambaka we worship, sweet augmenter of prosperity.
As from its stem the cucumber, so may I be released from death, not reft of immortality.

## HYMN LX. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHEN thou, O Sun, this day, arising sinless, shalt speak the truth to Varuṇa and Mitra,
O Aditi, may all the Deities love us, and thou, O Aryaman, while we are singing.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Looking on man, O Varuṇa and Mitra, this Sun ascendeth up by both the pathways,
Guardian of all things fixt, of all that moveth, beholding good and evil acts of mortals.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He from their home hath yoked the Seven gold Coursers who, dropping oil and fatness, carry Sūrya.
Yours, Varuṇa and Mitra, he surveyeth the worlds and living creatures like a herdsman.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Your coursers rich in store of sweets have mounted: to the bright ocean Sūrya hath ascended,
For whom the Ādityas make his pathway ready, Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, accordant.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For these, even Aryaman, Varuṇa and Mitra, are the chastisers of all guile and falsehood.
These, Aditi's Sons, infallible and mighty, have waxen in the home of law Eternal.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  These, Mitra, Varuṇa whom none deceiveth, with great power quicken even the fool to wisdom,
And, wakening, moreover, thoughtful insight, lead it by easy paths o’er grief and trouble.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They ever vigilant, with eyes that close not, caring for heaven and earth, lead on the thoughtless.
Even in the river's bed there is a shallow. across this broad expanse may they conduct us.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  When Aditi and Varuṇa and Mitra, like guardians, give Sudās their friendly shelter,
Granting him sons and lineal succession, let us not, bold ones! move the Gods to anger.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  May he with ofierings purify the altar from any stains of Varuṇa's reviler.
Aryaman save us us all those who hate us: give room and freedom to Sudās, ye Mighty.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Hid from our eyes is their resplendent meeting: by their mysterious might they hold dominion.
Heroes! we cry trembling in fear before you, even in the greatness of your power have mercy.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He who wins favour for his prayer by worship, that he may gain him strength and highest riches,
That good man's mind the Mighty Ones will follow: they have brought comfort to his spacious dwelling.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  This priestly task, Gods! Varuṇa and Mitra! hath been performed for you at sacrifices.
Convey us safely over every peril. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
