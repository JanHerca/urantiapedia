## HYMN I. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE men from fire-sticks, with their hands' swift movement, have, in deep thought, engendered glorious Agni,
Far-seen, with pointed flame, Lord of the homestead.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Vasus set that Agni in the dwelling, fair to behold, for help from every quarter:
Who, in the home for ever, must be honoured.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Shine thou before us, Agni, well-enkindled, with flame, Most Youthful God, that never fadeth.
To thee come all our sacrificial viands.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Among all fires these fires have shone most brightly, splendid with light, begirt by noble heroes,
Where men of lofty birth sit down together.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Victorious Agni, grant us wealth with wisdom, wealth with brave sons, famous and independent,
Which not a foe who deals in magic conquers.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  To whom, the Strong, at morn and eve comes, maid-like, the ladle dropping oil, with its oblation.
Wealth-seeking comes to him his own devotion.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Burn up all malice with those flames, O Agni, wherewith of old thou burntest up Jarutha,
And drive away in silence pain and sickness.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  With him who lighteth up thy splendour, Agni, excellent, pure, refulgent, Purifier,
Be present, and with us through these our praises.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Agni, the patriarchal men, the mortals who have in many places spread thy lustre,—
Be gracious to us here for their sake also.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Let these men, heroes in the fight with foemen, prevail against all godless arts of 4magic,—
These who ipprove the noble song I sing thee.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Let us not sit in want of men, O Agni, without descendants, heroleu, about thee:
But, O House-Friend, in houses full of children.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  By sacrifice which the Steeds' Lord ever visits, there make our dwelling rich in seed and offspring,
Increasing still with lineal successors.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Guard us, O Agni, from the hated demon, guard us from malice of the churlish sinner:
Allied with thee may I subdue assailants.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  May this same fire of mine surpass all others, this fire where offspring, vigorous and firm-handed,
Wins, on a thousand paths, what ne’er shall perish.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  This is that Agni, saviour from the foeman, who guards the kindler of the flame from sorrow:
Heroes of noble lineage serve and tend him.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  This is that Agni, served in many places, whom the rich lord who brings oblation kindles,
And round him goes the priest at sacrifices.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Agni, may we with riches in possession bring thee continual ofierings in abundance,
Using both means to draw thee to our worship.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Agni, bear thou, Eternal, these most welcome oblations to the Deities' assembly:
Let them enjoy our very fragrant presents.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Give us not up, Agni, to want of heroes, to wretched clothes, to need, to destitution.
Yield us not, Holy One, to fiend or hunger; injure us not at home or in the forest.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Give strength and power to these my prayers, O Agni; O God, pour blessings on our chiefs and nobles.
Grant that both we and they may share thy bounty. Ye Gods, protect us evermore with blessings.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Thou Agni, swift to hear, art fair of aspect: beam forth, O Son of Strength, in full effulgence.
Let me not want, with thee, a son for ever: let not a manly hero ever fail us.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Condemn us not to indigence, O Agni, beside these flaming fires which Gods have kindled;
Nor, even after fault, let thy displeasure, thine as a God, O Son of Strength, o’ertake us.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  O Agni, fair of face, the wealthy mortal who to the Immortal offers his oblation.
Hath him who wins him treasure by his Godhead, to whom the prince, in need, goes supplicating.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Knowing our chief felicity, O Agni, bring hither ample riches to our nobles,
Wherewith we may enjoy ourselves, O Victor, with undiminished life and hero children.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Give strength and power to these my prayers, O Agni; O God, pour blessings on bur chiefs and nobles.
Grant that both we and they may share thy bounty. Ye Gods, protect us evermore with blessings.

## HYMN II. Āprīs.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  GLADLY accept, this day, our fuel, Agni: send up thy sacred smoke and shine sublimely.
Touch the celestial summits with thy columns, and overspread thee with the rays of Sūrya.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With sacrifice to these we men will honour the majesty of holy Narāśaṁsa-
To these the pure, most wise, the thought. inspirers, Gods who enjoy both sorts of our oblations.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We will extol at sacrifice for ever, as men may do, Agni whom Manu kindled,
Your very skilful Asura, meet for worship, envoy between both worlds, the truthful speaker.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Bearing the sacred grass, the men who serve him strew it with reverence, on their knees, by Agni.
Calling him to the spotted grass, oil-sprinkled, adorn him, ye Adhvaryus, with oblation.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  With holy thoughts the pious have thrown open Doors fain for chariots in the Gods’ assembly.
Like two full mother cows who lick their youngling, like maidens for the gathering, they adorn them.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And let the two exalted Heavenly Ladies, Morning and Night, like a cow good at milking,
Come, much-invoked, and on our grass be seated ' wealthy, deserving worship, for our welfare.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  You, Bards and Singers at men's sacrifices, both filled with wisdom, I incline to worship.
Send up our offerings when we call upon you, and so among the Gods obtain us treasures.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  May Bhāratī with all her Sisters, Iḷā accordant with the Gods, with mortals Agni,
Sarasvatī with all her kindred Rivers, come to this grass, Three Goddesses, and seat them.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Well pleased with us do thou, O God, O Tvaṣṭar, give ready issue to our procreant vigour,
Whence springs the hero, powerful, skilled in action, lover of Gods, adjuster of the press-stones.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Send to the Gods the oblation, Lord of Forests, and let the Immolator, Agni, dress it.
He as the truer Priest shall offer worship, for the God'sgenerations well he knoweth.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Come thou to us, O Agni, duly kindled, together with the potent Gods and Indra.
On this our grass sit Aditi, happy Mother, and let our Hail! delight the Gods Immortal.

## HYMN III. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ASSOCIATE with fires, make your God Agni envoy at sacrifice, best skilled in worship,
Established firm among mankind, the Holy, flame-crowned and fed with oil, the Purifier.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Like a steed neighing eager for the pasture, when he hath stepped forth from the great enclosure:
Then the wind following blows upon his splendour, and, straight, the path is black which thou hast travelled.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  From thee a Bull but newly born, O Agni, the kindled everlasting flames rise upward.
Aloft to heaven thy ruddy smoke ascendeth: Agni, thou speedest to the Gods as envoy.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou whose fresh lustre o’er the earth advanceth when greedily with thy jaws thy food thou eatest.
Like a host hurried onward comes thy lasso: fierce, with thy tongue thou piercest, as ’twere barley.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The men have decked him both at eve and morning, Most Youthful Agni, as they tend a courser.
They kindle him, a guest within his dwelling: bright shines the splendour of the worshipped Hero.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O fair of face, beautiful is thine aspect when, very near at hand, like gold thou gleamest,
Like Heaven's thundering roar thy might approaches, and like the wondrous Sun thy light thou showest.

Guard us, O Agni, with those boundless glories as with a hundred fortresses of iron.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thine are resistless songs for him who offers, and hero-giving hymns wherewith thou savest;
With these, O Son of Strength, O Jātavedas, guard us, preserve these princes and the singers.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  When forth he cometh, like an axe new-sharpened, pure in his form, resplendent in his body,
Sprung, sought with eager longing, from his Parents, for the Gods’ worship, Sage and Purifier:

To him who goes as messenger with knowledge between all songs of men and Gods in heaven.

He who with bright teeth seizeth fast the forests, and eats his food, though plenteous, in a moment.

Victorious God, let us not sit about thee like men devoid of strength, beauty, and worship.

Agni, no son is he who springs from others: lengthen not out the pathways of the foolish.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Unwelcome for adoption is the stranger, one to be thought of as another's offipring,
Though grown familiar by continual presence. May our strong hero come, freshly triumphant.
