## HYMN XXIX. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAN'S worship of the Gods hath three great lustres, and three celestial lights have they established
The Maruts gifted with pure strength adore thee, for thou, O Indra, art their sapient Ṛṣi.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  What time the Maruts sang their song to Indra, joyous when he had drunk of Soma juices,
He grasped his thunderbolt to slay the Dragon, and loosed, that they might flow, the youthful Waters.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And, O ye Brahmans, Maruts, so may Indra drink draughts of this my carefully pressed Soma;
For this oblation found for man the cattle, and Indra, having quaffed it, slew the Dragon.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Then heaven and earth he sundered and supported: wrapped even in these he struck the Beast with terror.
So Indra forced the Engulfer to disgorgement, and slew the Dānava. panting against him.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thus all the Gods, O Maghavan, delivered to thee of their free will the draught of Soma;
When thou for Etaśa didst cause to tarry the flying mares of Sūrya racing forward.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When Maghavan with the thunderbolt demolished his nine-and-ninety castles all together,
The Maruts, where they met, glorified Indra: ye with the Tṛṣṭup hymn obstructed heaven.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As friend to aid a friend, Agni dressed quickly three hundred buffaloes, even as he willed it.
And Indra, from man's gift, for Vṛtra's slaughter, drank ofr at once three lakes of pressed-out Soma.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  When thou three hundred buffaloes' flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as Maghavan, three lakes of Soma,
All the Gods raised as ’twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because he slew the Dragon.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  What time ye came with strong steeds swiftly speeding, O Uśanā and Indra, to the dwelling,
Thou camest thither -conquering together with Kutsa and the Gods: thou slewest Śuṣṇa.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  One car-wheel of the Sun thou rolledst forward, and one thou settest free to move for Kutsa.
Thou slewest noseless Dasyus with thy weapon, and in their home o’erthrewest hostile speakers.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The lauds of Gauriviti made thee mighty to Vidathin's son, as prey, thou gavest Pipru.
Rjisivan drew thee into friendship dressing the sacred food, and thou hast drunk his Soma.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Navagvas and Dasgvas with libations of Soma juice sing hymns of praise to Indra.
Labouring at their task the men laid open the stall of Kine though firmly closed and fastened.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  How shall I serve thee, Maghavan, though knowing full well what hero deeds thou hast accomplished?
And the fresh deeds which thou wilt do, Most Mighty! these, too, will we tell forth in sacred synods.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Resistless from of old through hero courage, thou hast done all these many acts, O Indra.
What thou wilt do in bravery, Thunder-wielder! none is there who may hinder this thy prowess.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Indra, accept the prayers which now are offered, accept the new prayers, Mightiest! which we utter.
Like fair and well-made robes, I, seeking riches, as a deft craftsman makes a car, have wrought them.

<span id="h30"></span>

## HYMN XXX. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHERE is that Hero? Who hath looked on Indra borne on light-rolling car by Tawny Coursers,
Who, Thunderer, seeks with wealth the Soma-presser, and to his house goes, much-invoked, to aid him?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I have beheld his strong and secret dwelling, longing have sought the Founder's habitation.
I asked of others, and they said in answer, May we, awakened men, attain to Indra.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We will tell, Indra, when we pour libation, what mighty deeds thou hast performed to please us.
Let him who knows not learn, who knows them listen: hither rides Maghavan with all his army.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra, when born, thou madest firm thy spirit: alone thou seekest war to fight with many.
With might thou clavest e’en the rock asunder, and foundest out the stable of the Milch-kine.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When thou wast born supremest at a distance, bearing a name renowned in far-off regions,
Since then e’en Gods have been afraid of Indra: he conquered all the floods which served the Dāsa.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  These blissful Maruts sing their psalm to praise thee, and pour to thee libation of the Soma.
Indra with wondrous powers subdued the Dragon, the guileful lurker who beset the waters.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou, Maghavan, from the first didst scatter foemen, speeding, while joying in the milk, the Giver.
There, seeking man's prosperity, thou torest away the head of Namuci the Dāsa.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Pounding the head of Namuci the Dāsa, me, too thou madest thine associate, Indra!
Yea, and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds, as on a car, brought to the Maruts.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Women for weapons hath the Dāsa taken, What injury can his feeble armies To me?
Well he distinguished his two different voices, and Indra then advanced to fight the Dasyu.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Divided from their calves the Cows went lowing around, on every side, hither and thither.
These Indra re-united with his helpers, what time the well-pressed Soma made him joyful.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  What time the Somas mixed by Babhru cheered him, loud the Steer bellowed in his habitations.
So Indra drank thereof, the Fort-destroyer, and gave him guerdon, in return, of milch-kine.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  This good deed have the Rusamas done, Agni! that they have granted me four thousand cattle.
We have received Rnancaya's wealth, of heroes the most heroic, which was freely offered.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The Rusamas, O Agni, sent me homeward with fair adornment and with kine in thousands.
The strong libations have made Indra joyful, when night, whose course was ending, changed to morning.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Night, well-nigh ended, at Rnancaya's coming, King of the Rusamas, was changed to morning.
Like a strong courser, fleet of foot, urged onward, Babhru hath gained four thousand as his guerdon.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  We have received four thousand head of cattle presented by the Rusamas, O Agni.
And we, the singers, have received the caldron of metal which was heated for Pravargya.
