## HYMN XII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  JOY, Mightiest Indra, known and marked, sprung most from Soma-draughts, wherewith
Thou smitest down the greedy fiend, for that we long.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Wherewith thou bolpest Adhrigu, the great Daśagva, and the God
Who stirs the sunlight, and the sea, for that we long.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Wherewith thou dravest forth like cars Sindhu and all the mighty floods
To go the way ordained by Law, for that we long.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Accept this laud for aid, made pure like oil, thou Caster of the Stone,
Whereby even in a moment thou hast waxen great.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Be pleased, Song-lover, with this song it flows abundant like the sea.
Indra, with all thy succours thou hast waxen great.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The God who from afar hath sent gifts to maintain our friendship's bond,
Thou. spreading them like rain from heaven, hast waxen great.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The beams that mark him have grown strong, the thunder rests between his arms,
When, like the Sun, he hath increased both Heaven and Earth.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  When, Mighty Lord of Heroes, thou didst cat a thousand buffaloes,
Then grew and waxed exceeding great thine Indra-power.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Indra consumeth with the rays of Sūrya the malicious man:
Like Agni conquering the woods, he hath grown strong.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  This newest thought of ours that suits the time approaches unto thee:
Serving, beloved in many a place it metes and marks.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The pious germ of sacrifice directly purifies the soul.
By Indra's lauds it waxes great, it metes and marks.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Indra who wins the friend hath spread himself to drink the Soma-draught:
Like worshipper's dilating praise; it metes and marks.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He whom the sages, living men, have gladdened, offering up their hymns,
Hath swelled like oil of sacrifice in Agni's mouth.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Aditi also hath brought forth a hymn for Indra, Sovran Lord:
The work of sacrifice for help is glorified.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The ministering priests have sung their songs for aid and eulogy:
God, thy Bays turn not from the rite which Law ordains.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  If, Indra, thou drink Soma by Viṣṇu's or Tṛta Āptya's side,
Or with the Maruts take delight in flowing drops;
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Or, Śakra, if thou gladden thee afar or in the sea of air,
Rejoice thee in this juice of ours, in flowing drops.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Or, Lord of Heroes if thou aid the worshipper who shed; the, juice,
Or him whose laud delights thee, and his flowing drops.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  To magnify the God, the God, Indra, yea, Indra for your help,
And promptly end the sacrifice-this have they gained.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  With worship, him whom men adore, with Soma, him who drinks it most,
Indra with lauds have they increasedthis have they gained.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  His leadings are with power and might and his instructions manifold:
He gives the worshipper all wealth: this have they gained.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For slaying Vṛtra have the Gods set Indra in the foremost place.
Indra the choral bands have sung, for vigorous strength.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  We to the Mighty with our might, with lauds to him who hears our call,
With holy hymns have sung aloud, for vigorous strength.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Not earth, nor heaven, nor firmaments contain the Thunder-wielding God:
They shake before his violent rush and vigorous strength.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  What time the Gods, O Indra, get thee foremost in the furious fight,
Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  When Vṛtra, stayer of the floods, thou si"est, Thundeicr with might,
Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  When Viṣṇu, through thine energy, strode wide those three great steps of his,
Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  When thy two beautiful Bay Steeds grew great and greater day by day,
Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  When, Indra, all the Marut folk humbly submitted them to thee,
Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  When yonder Sun, that brilliant light, thou settest in the heaven above,
Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  To thee, O Indra, with this thought the sage lifts up this eulogy,
Akin and leading as on foot to sacrifice.
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  When in thine own dear dwelling all gathered have lifted up the voice
Milk-streams at worship's central spot, for sacrifice,
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  As Priest, O Indra, give us wealth in brave men and good steeds ana kine
That we may first remember thee for sacrifice.

## HYMN XIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDRA, when Soma juices flow, makes his mind pure and meet for lauds.
He gains the power that brings success, for great is he.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In heaven's first region, in the seat of Gods, is he who brings success,
Most glorious, prompt to save, who wins the water-floods.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Him, to win strength, have I invoked, even Indra mighty for the fray.
Be thou most near to us for bliss, a Friend to aid.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra, Song -lover, here for thee the worshipper's libation flows.
Rejoicing in this sacred grass thou shinest forth.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Even now, O Indra, give us that which, pressing juice, we crave of thee.
Bring us wealth manifold which finds the light of heaven.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  What time the zealous worshipper hath boldly sung his songs to thee,
Like branches of a tree up-grows what they desire.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Generate songs even as of old, give car unto the singer's call.
Thou for the pious hast grown great at each carouse.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Sweet strains that glorify him play like waters speeding down a slope,
Yea, him who in this song is called the Lord of Heaven;
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Yea, who alone is called the Lord, the single Ruler of the folk,
By worshippers seeking aid: may he joy in the draught.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Praise him, the Glorious, skilled in song, Lord of the two victorious Bays:
They seek the worshipper's abode who bows in prayer.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Put forth thy strength: with dappled Steeds come, thou of mighty intellect,
With swift Steeds to the sacrifice, for ’tis thy joy.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Grant wealth to those who praise thee, Lord of Heroes, Mightiest Indra: give
Our princes everlasting fame and opulence.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I call thee when the Sun is risen, I call thee at the noon of day:
With thy car-horses, Indra, come wellpleased to us.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Speed forward hither, come to us, rejoice thee in the milky draught:
Spin out the thread of ancient time, as well is known.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If, Śakra, Vṛtra-slayer, thou be far away or near to us.
Or in the sea, thou art the guard of Soma juice.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Let songs we sing and Soma-drops expressed by us make Indra strong:
The tribes who bring oblations find delight in him.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Him sages longing for his aid, with offerings brought in eager haste,
Him. even as branches, all mankind have made to grow.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  At the Trkadrukas the Gods span sacrifice that stirred the mind:
May our songs strengthen him who still hath strengthened us.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  When, true to duty, at due times the worshipper offers lauds to thee,
They call him Purifier, Pure, and Wonderful.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  That mind of Rudra, fresh and strong, moves conscious in the ancient ways,
With reference whereto the wise have ordered this.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  If thou elect to be my Friend drink of this sacrificial juice,
By help whereof we may subdue all enemies.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  O Indra, Lover of the song, when shall thy praiser be most blest?
When wilt thou grant us wealth in herds of kine and steeds?
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And thy two highIy-lauded Bays, strong stallions, draw thy car who art
Untouched by age, most gladdening car for which we pray.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  With ancient offerings we implore the Young and Strong whom many praise.
He from of old hath sat upon dear sacred grass.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Wax miglity, thou whom many laud for aids which Ṛṣis have extolled.
Pour down for us abundant food and guard us well.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  O Indra, Caster of the Stone, thou helpest him who praises thee:
From sacrifice I send to thee a mindyoked hymn.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Here, yoking for the Soma-draught these Horses, sharers of thy feast,
Thy Bay Steeds, Indra, fraught with weal tb, consent to come.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Attendants on thy glory, let the Rudras roar assent to thee,
And all the Marut companies come tothe feast.
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  These his victorious followers bold in the heavens the place they love,
Leagued in the heart of sacrifice, as well we know.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  That we may long behold the light, what time the ordered rite proceeds,
He duly measures, as he views, the sacrifice.
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  O Indra, strong is this thy car, and strong are these Bay Steeds of thine:
O Śatakratu, thou art strong, strong is our call.
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Strong is the press-stone, strong thy joy, strong is the flowing Soma juice:
Strong is the rite thou furtherest, strong is our call.
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  As strong I call on thee the Strong, O Thunderer with thy thousand aids:
For thou hast won the hymn of praise. Strong is our call.

## HYMN XIV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  IF I, O Indra, were, like thee, the single Sovran of all wealth,
My worshipper should be rich in kine.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I should be fain, O Lord of Power, to strengthen and enrich the sage,
Were I the Lord of herds of kine.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To worshippers who press the juice thy goodness, Indra, is a cow
Yielding in plenty kine and steeds.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  None is there, Indra, God or man, to hinder thy munificence,
The wealth which, lauded, thou wilt give.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The sacrifice made Indra strong when he unrolled the earth, and made
Himself a diadem in heaven.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thine aid we claim, O Indra, thine who after thou hast waxen great
Hast won all treasures for thine own.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  In Soma's ecstasy Indra spread the firmament and realms of light,
When he cleft Vala limb from limb.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Showing the hidden he drave forth the cows for the Aṅgirases,
And Vala he cast headlong down.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  By Indra were the lumirious realms of heaven established and secured,
Firm and immovable from their place.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Indra, thy laud moves quickly like a joyous wave of water-floods:

Subduing all contending hosts.

by magic arts and mount to heaven,
Thou, Indra, castest down to earth.

Their settlement who poured no gifts.

Win thou the waters day by day, thralls of the strong.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  That lofty Indra-power of thine, thy strength and thine intelligence,
Thy thunderbolt for which we long, the wish makes keen.

Excellent deeds for evermore are all thine own.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Ever, alone, O highly-praised, thou sendest Vṛtras to their rest:
None else than Indra executes the mighty deed.

Still with our heroes fight and win the light of heaven.

May he, impetuous, suffer harm by his own deeds.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  May sin o’ertake our human foe, the man who speaketh evil thing,
Him who would cause our misery, whose heart is false.

Ye, Vasus, well discriminate the false and true.

<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Grant us a home with triple guard, Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa!
Unthreatened, Maruts! meet for praise, and filled with men.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And as we human beings, O Ādityas, are akin to death,
Graciously lengthen ye our lives that we may live.

## HYMN XIX. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SING praise to hiin, the Lord of Light. The Gods have made the God to be their messenger,
And sent oblation to Gods.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Agni, the Bounteous Giver, bright with varied flames, laud thou, O singer Sobhari-
Him who controls this sacred food with Soma blent, who hath first claim to sacrifice.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thee have we chosen skilftillest in sacrifice, Immortal Priest among the Gods,
Wise finisher of this holy rite:
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The Son of Strength, the blessed, brightly shining One, Agni whose light is excellent.
May be by sacrifice win us in heaven the grace of Mitra, Varuṇa, and the Floods.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The mortal who hath ministered to Agni with oblation, fuel, ritual lore,
And reverence, skilled in sacrifice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Verily swift to run are his fleet-footed steeds, and most resplendent fame is his.
No trouble caused by Gods or wrought by mortal man from any side o’ertaketh him.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May we by thine own fires be well supplied with fire, O Son of Strength, O Lord of Might:
Thou as our Friend hast worthy men.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Agni, who praises like a guest of friendly mind, is as a car that brings us gear.
Also in thee is found perfect security thou art the Sovran Lord of wealth.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  That man, moreover, merits praise who brings, auspicious Agni, sacrificial gifts
May he win riches by his thoughts.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He for whose sacrifice thou standest up erect is prosperous and rules o’er men.
He wins with coursers and with singers killed in song: with heroes he obtains the prize.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He in whose dwelling Agni is chief ornament, and, all-desired, loves his laud well,
And zealously tends his offerings-
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  His, or the lauding sage's word, his, Son of Strength! who Is most prompt with sacred gifts,
Set thou beneath the Gods, Vasu, above mankind, the speech of the intelligent.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He who with sacrificial gifts or homage bringeth very skilful Agni nigh,
Or him who flashes fast with song,
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The mortal who with blazing fuel, as his laws command, adores the Perfect God,
Blest with his thoughts in splendour shall exceed all men, as though he overpassed the floods.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Give us the splendour, Agni, which may overcome each greedy fiend in our abode,
The wrath of evil-hearted folk.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  That, wherewith Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman, the Aśvins, Bhaga give us light,
That may we, by thy power finding best furtherance, worship, O Indra, helped by thee.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  O Agni, most devout are they, the sages who have set thee Sage exceeding wise,
O God, for men to look upon:
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Who have arranged thine altar Blessed God, at morn brought thine oblation, pressed the juice.
They by their deeds of strength have won diem, mighty wealth, who have set all their hope in thee.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  -May Agni worshipped bring us bliss, may the gift, Blessed One, and sacrifice bring bliss;
Yea, may our praises bring us bliss.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Show forth the mind that brings success in war with fiends, wherewith thou conquerest in fight.
Bring down the many firm hopes of our enemies, and let us vanquish with thine aid.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  I praise with song the Friend of man, whom Gods sent down to be herald and messenger,
Best worshipper, bearer of our gifts.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Thou unto sharp-toothed Agni, Young and Radiant God, proclaimest with thy song the feast-
Agni, who for our sweet strains moulds heroic strength when sacred oil is offered him,
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  While, served with sacrificial oil, now upward and now downward Agni moves his sword,
As doth the Asura his robe.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The God, the Friend of man, who bears our gifts to heaven, the God with his sweet-smelling mouth,
Distributes, skilled in sacrifice, his precious things, Invoking Priest, Immortal God.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Son of Strength, Agni, if thou wert the mortal, bright as Mitra, I worshipped with our gifts!
And I were the Immortal God
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  I would not give thee up, Vasu, to calumny, or misery, O Bounteous One.
My worshipper should feel no hunger or distress, nor, Agni, should he live in sin.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Like a son cherished in his father's houi§e, let our oblation rise unto the Gods.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  With thine immediate aid may I, excellent Agni, ever gain my wish
A mortal with a God to help.
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  O Agni, by thy wisdom, by thy bounties, by thy leading may I gather wealth.
Excellent Agni, thou art called my Providence: delight thou to be liberal.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Agni, he conquers by thine aid that brings him store of noble heroes and great strength,
Whose bond of friendship is thy choice.
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Thy spark is black and crackling, kindled in due time, O Bounteous, it is taken up.
Thou art the dear Friend of the mighty Mornings: thou shinest in glimmerings of the night.
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  We Sobharis have come to him, for succour, who is good to help with thousand powers,
The Sovran, Trasadasyu's Friend.
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  O Agni, thou on whom all other fires depend, as branches on the parent stem,
I make the treasures of the folk, like songs, mine own, while I exalt thy sovran might.
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  The mortal whom, Ādityas, ye, Guilelew, lead to the farther bank
Of all the princes, Bounteous Ones
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Whoe’er he be, Man-ruling Kings! the Regent of the race of men-
May we, O Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman, like him be furtherers of your law.
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  A gift of fifty female slaves hath Trasadasyu given me, Purukutsa's son,
Most liberal, kind, lord of the brave.
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  And Śyāva too for me led forth a strong steed at Suvastu's ford:
A herd of three times seventy kine, good lord of gifts, he gave to me.

## HYMN XX Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET none, Swift Travellers! check you: come hither, like-spirited, stay not far away,
Ye benders even of what is firm.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Maruts, Ṛbhukṣans, Rudras come ye with your cars strong-fellied and exceeding bright.
Come, ye for whom we long, with food, to sacrifice, come ye with love to Sobbari.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For well we know the vigorous might of Rudra's Sons, the Martits, who are passing strong,
Swift Viṣṇu's band, who send the rain.,
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Islands are bursting forth and misery is stayed: the heaven and earth are joined in one.
Decked with bright rings, ye spread the broad expanses out, when ye, Self. luminous, stirred yourselves.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Even things immovable shake and reel, the mountains and the forest trees at your approach,
And the earth trembles as ye come.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  To lend free course, O Maruts, to your furious rush, heaven high and higher still gives way,
Where they, the Heroes mighty with their arms, display their gleaming omaments on their forms.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  After their Godlike nature they, the bull. like Heroes, dazzling and impetuous, wear
Great splendour as they show erect.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The pivot of the Sobharis' chariot within the golden box is balmed with milk.
May they the Well-born, Mighty, kindred of the Cow, aid us to food and to delight.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Bring, ye who sprinkle balmy drops. oblations to your vigorous Marut company,
To those whose leader is the Bull.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Come hither, O ye Mares, on your stronghorsed car, solid in look, with solid naves.
Lightly like winged falcons, O ye Heroes, come, come to enjoy our ofrerings.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Their decoration is the same: their omaments of gold are bright upon their arms;
Their lances glitter splendidly.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They toil not to defend their bodies from attack, strong Heroes with their mighty arms.
Strong are your bows and strong the weapons in your cars, and glory sits on every face.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Whose name extendeth like a sea, alone, resplendent, so that all have joy in it,
And life-power like ancestral might.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Pay honour to these Maruts and sing praise to them, for of the wheel-spokes of the car
Of these loud roarers none is last: this is their power, this moves them to give mighty gifts.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Blest by your favouring help was he, O Maruts, at the earlier flushings of the morn,
And even now shall he be blest.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The strong man to whose sacrifice, O Heroes, ye approach that ye may taste thereof,
With glories and with war that winneth spoil shall gain great bliss, ye Shakers of the world.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Even as Rudra's Sons, the brood of the Creator Dyaus, the Asura, desire,
O Youthful Ones, so shall it be:
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And these the bounteous, worthy of the Maruts who move onward pouring down the rain-
Even for their sake, O Youthful Ones, with kindest heart take us to you to be your own.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O Sobhari, with newest song sing out unto the youthful purifying Bulls,
Even as a plougher to his steers.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Who, like a celebrated boxer, overcome the challengers in every fight:
They who, like shining bulls, are most illustrious-honour those Maruts with thy song.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Allied by common ancestry, ye Maruts, even the Cows, alike in energy,
Lick, all by turns, each other's head.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Even mortal man, ye Dancers breast adorned with gold, attains to brotherhood with you.
Mark ye and notice us, O Maruts; evermore your friendship is secured to us.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  O Maruts, rich in noble gifts, bring us a portion of the Maruts’ medicine,
Ye Coursers who are Friends to us.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Haters of those who serve you not, bliss-bringers, bring us bliss with those auspicious aids
Wherewith ye are victorious and guard Sindhu well, and succour Krvi in his need.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Maruts, who rest on fair trimmed grass, what balm soever Sindhu or Asikni hath,
Or mountains or the seas contain.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Ye carry on your bodies, ye who see it all: so bless us graciously therewith.
Cast, Maruts, to the ground our sick man's malady: replace the dislocated limb.
