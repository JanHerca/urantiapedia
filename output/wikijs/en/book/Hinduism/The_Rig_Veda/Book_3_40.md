## HYMN XXXI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WISE, teaching, following the thought of Order, the sonless gained a grandson from his daughter.
Fain, as a sire, to see his child prolific, he sped to meet her with an eager spirit.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Son left not his portion to the brother, he made a home to hold him who should gain, it.
What time his Parents gave the Priest his being, of the good pair one acted, one promoted.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Agni was born trembling with tongue that flickered, so that the Red's great children should be honoured.
Great is their germ, that born of them is mighty, great the Bays' Lord's approach through sacrifices.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Conquering bands upon the Warrior waited: they recognized great light from out the darkness.
The conscious Dawns went forth to meet his coming, and the sole Master of the kine was Indra.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The sages freed them from their firmbuilt prison: the seven priests drove them forward with their spirit.
All holy Order's pathway they discovered he, full of knowledge, shared these deeds through worship.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When Saramā had found the mountain's fissure, that vast and ancient place she plundered thoroughly.
In the floods' van she led them forth, light-footed: she who well knew came first unto their lowing.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Longing for friendship came the noblest singer: the hill poured forth its treasure for the pious.
The Hero with young followers fought and conquered, and straightway Aṅgiras was singing praises,
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Peer of each noble thing, yea, all excelling, all creatures doth he know, he slayeth Śuṣṇa.
Our leader, fain for war, singing from heaven, as Friend he saved his lovers from dishonour.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  They sate them down with spirit fain for booty, making with hymns a way to life eternal.
And this is still their place of frequent session, whereby they sought to gain the months through Order.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Drawing the milk of ancient seed prolific, they joyed as they beheld their own possession.
Their shout of triumph heated earth and heaven. When the kine showed, they bade the heroes rouse them.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Indra drove forth the kine, that Vṛtra-slayer, while hymns of praise rose up and gifts were offered.
For him the Cow, noble and far-extending, poured pleasant juices, bringing oil and sweetness.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  They made a mansion for their Father, deftly provided him a great and glorious dwelling;
With firm support parted and stayed the Parents, and, sitting, fixed him there erected, mighty.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  What time the ample chalice had impelled him, swift waxing, vast, to pierce the earth and heaven,—
Him in whom blameless songs are all united: all powers invincible belong to Indra.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I crave thy powers, I crave thy mighty friendship: full many a team goes to the Vṛtra-slayer.
Great is the laud, we seek the Princes' favour. Be thou, O Maghavan, our guard and keeper.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He, having found great, splendid, rich dominion, sent life and motion to his friends and lovers.
Indra who shone together with the Heroes begot the song, the fire, and Sun and Morning.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Vast, the House-Friend, he set the waters flowing, all-lucid, widely spread, that move together.
By the wise cleansings of the meath made holy, through days, and nights they speed the swift streams onward.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  To thee proceed the dark, the treasure-holders, both of them sanctified by Sūrya's bounty.
The while thy ovely storming Friends, O Indra, fail to attain the measure of thy greatness.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Be Lord of joyous songs, O Vṛtra-slayer, Bull dear to all, who gives the power of living.
Come unto us with thine auspicious friendship, hastening, Mighty One, with mighty succours.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Like Aṅgiras I honour him with worship, and renovate old song for him the Ancient.
Chase thou the many godless evil creatures, and give us, Maghavan, heaven's light to help m.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Far forth are spread the purifying waters convey thou us across them unto safety.
Save us, our Charioteer, from harm, O Indra, soon, very soon, make us win spoil of cattle.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  His kine their Lord hath shown, e’en Vṛtra's slayer, through the black hosts he passed with red attendants.
Teaching us pleasant things by holy Order, to, us hath he thrown open all his portals.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where spoil is gathered.
The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.

<span id="h32"></span>

## HYMN XXXII. Indra

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  DRINK thou this Soma, Indra, Lord of Soma; drink thou the draught of noonday which thou Iovest.
Puffing thy cheeks, impetuous, liberal Giver, here loose thy two Bay Horses and rejoice thee.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Quaff it pure, meal-blent, mixt with milk, O Indra; we have poured forth the Soma for thy rapture.
Knit with the prayer-fulfilling band of Maruts, yea, with the Rudras, drink till thou art sated;
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Those who gave increase to thy strength and vigour; the Maruts singing forth thy might, O Indra.
Drink thou, O fair of cheek, whose hand wields thunder, with Rudras banded, at our noon libation.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They, even the Maruts who were there, excited with song the meath-created strength of Indra.
By them impelled to act he reached the vitals Of Vṛtra, though he deemed that none might wound him.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Pleased, like a man, with our libation, Indra, drink, for enduring hero might, the Soma.
Lord of Bays, moved by sacrifice come hither: thou with the Swift Ones stirrest floods and waters.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When thou didst loose the streams to run like racers in the swift contest, having smitten Vṛtra
With flying weapon where he lay, O Indra, and, godless, kept the Goddesses encompassed.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  With reverence let us worship mighty Indra, great and sublime, eternal, everyouthful,
Whose greatness the dear world-halves have not measured, no, nor conceived the might of him the Holy.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Many are Indra's nobly wrought achievements, and none of all the Gods transgress his statutes.
He beareth up this earth and heaven, and, doer of marvels, he begot the Sun and Morning.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Herein, O Guileless One, is thy true greatness, that soon as born thou drankest up the Soma.
Days may not check the power of thee the Mighty, nor the nights, Indra, nor the months, nor autumns.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  As soon as thou wast born in highest heaven thou drankest Soma to delight thee, Indra;
And when thou hadst pervaded earth and heaven thou wast the first supporter of the singer.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou, puissant God, more mighty, slewest. Ahi showing his strength when couched around the waters.
The heaven itself attained not to thy greatness when with one hip of thine the earth was shadowed.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Sacrifice, Indra, made thee wax so mighty, the dear oblation with the flowing Soma.
O Worshipful, with worship help our worship, for worship helped thy bolt when slaying Ahi.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  With sacrifice and wish have I brought Indra; still for new blessings may I turn him hither,
Him magnified by ancient songs and praises, by lauds of later time and days yet recent.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I have brought forth a song when longing seized me: ere the decisive day will I laud Indra;
Then may he safely bear us over trouble, as in a ship, when both sides invocate him.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Full is his chalice: Glory! Like a pourer I have filled up the vessel for his drinking.
Presented on the right, dear Soma juices have brought us Indra, to rejoice him, hither.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Not the deep-flowing flood, O Much-invoked One! not hills that compass thee about restrain thee,
Since here incited, for thy friends, O Indra, thou breakest e’en the firm built stall of cattle.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where spoil is gathered,
The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.

<span id="h33"></span>

## HYMN XXXIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FORTH from the bosom of the mountains, eager as two swift mares with loosened rein contending,
Like two bright mother cows who lick their youngling, Vipāś and Sutudri speed down their waters.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Impelled by Indra whom ye pray to urge you, ye move as ’twere on chariots to the ocean.
Flowing together, swelling with your billows, O lucid Streams, each of you seeks the other.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I have attained the most maternal River, we have approached Vipāś, the broad, the blessed.
Licking as ’twere their calf the pair of Mothers flow onward to their common home together.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  We two who rise and swell with billowy waters move forward to the home which Gods have made us.
Our flood may not be stayed when urged to motion. What would the singer, calling to the Rivers?
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Linger a little at my friendly bidding rest, Holy Ones, a moment in your journey.
With hymn sublime soliciting your favour Kuśika's son hath called unto the River.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Indra who wields the thunder dug our channels: he smote down Vṛtra, him who stayed our currents.
Savitar, God, the lovely-handed, led us, and at his sending forth we flow expanded.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  That hero deed of Indra must be lauded for ever that he rent Ahi in pieces.
He smote away the obstructors with his thunder, and eager for their course forth flowed the waters.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Never forget this word of thine, O singer, which future generations shall reecho.
In hymns, O bard, show us thy loving kindness. Humble us not mid men. To thee be honour!
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  List quickly, Sisters, to the bard who cometh to you from far away with car and wagon.
Bow lowly down; be easy to be traversed stay, Rivers, with your floods below our axles.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Yea, we will listen to thy words, O singer. With wain and car from far away thou comest.
Low, like a nursing mother, will I bend me, and yield me as a maiden to her lover.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Soon as the Bharatas have fared across thee, the warrior band, urged on and sped by Indra,
Then let your streams flow on in rapid motion. I crave your favour who deserve our worship.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The warrior host, the Bharatas, fared over the singer won the favour of the Rivers.
Swell with your billows, hasting, pouring riches. Fill full your channels, and roll swiftly onward.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  So let your wave bear up the pins, and ye, O Waters, spare the thongs;
And never may the pair of Bulls, harmless and sinless, waste away.

<span id="h34"></span>

## HYMN XXXIV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FORT-RENDER, Lord of Wealth, dispelling foemen, Indra with lightnings hath o’ercome the Dāsa.
Impelled by prayer and waxen great in body, he hath filled earth and heaven, the Bounteous Giver.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I stimulate thy zeal, the Strong, the Hero decking my song of praise forth; Immortal.
O Indra, thou art equally the Leader of heavenly hosts and human generations.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Leading, his band Indra encompassed Vṛtra; weak grew the wily leader of enchanters.
He who burns fierce in forests slaughtered Vyaṁsa, and made the Milch-kine of the nights apparent.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra, light-winner, days' Creator, conquered, victorious, hostile bands with those who loved him.
For man the days' bright ensign he illumined, and found the light for his joy and gladness.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Forward to fiercely falling blows pressed Indra, herolike doing many hero exploits.
These holy songs he taught the bard who gaised him, and widely spread these Dawns' resplendent colour.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They laud the mighty acts of him the Mighty, the many glorious deeds performed by Indra.
He in his strength, with all-surpassing prowess, through wondrous arts crushed the malignant Dasyus.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Lord of the brave, Indra who rules the people gave freedom to the Gods by might and battle.
Wise singers glorify with chanted praises these his achievements in Vivasvān's dwelling.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Excellent, Conqueror, the victory-giver, the winner of the light and Godlike Waters,
He who hath won this broad earth and this heaven, -in Indra they rejoice who love devotions.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He gained possession of the Sun and Horses, Indra obtained the Cow who feedeth many.
Treasure of gold he won; he smote the Dasyus, and gave protection to the Āryan colour.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He took the plants and days for his possession; he gained the forest trees and air's mid-region.
Vala he cleft, and chased away opponents: thus was he tamer of the overweening.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers treasures.

<span id="h35"></span>

## HYMN XXXV Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MOUNT the Bay Horses to thy chariot harnessed, and come to us like Vāyu with his coursers.
Thou, hastening to us, shalt drink the Soma. Hail, Indra. We have poured it for thy rapture.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For him, the God who is invoked by many, the two swift Bay Steeds to the pole I harness,
That they in fleet course may bring Indra hither, e’en to this sacrifice arranged completely.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bring the strong Steeds who drink the warm libation, and, Bull of Godlike nature, be thou gracious.
Let thy Steeds eat; set free thy Tawny Horses, and roasted grain like this consume thou daily.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Those who are yoked by prayer I harness, fleet friendly Bays who take their joy together.
Mounting thy firm and easy car, O Indra, wise and all-knowing come thou to the Soma.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  No other worshippers must stay beside them thy Bays, thy vigorous and smooth-backed Coursers.
Pass by them all and hasten onward hither: with Soma pressed we will prepare to feast thee.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thine is this Soma: hasten to approach it. Drink thou thereof, benevolent, and cease not.
Sit on the sacred grass at this our worship, and take these drops into thy belly, Indra.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The grass is strewn for thee, pressed is the Soma; the grain is ready for thy Bays to feed on.
To thee who lovest them, the very mighty, strong, girt by Maruts, are these gifts presented.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  This the sweet draught, with cows, the men, the mountains, the waters, Indra, have for thee made ready.
Come, drink thereof, Sublime One, friendly-minded, foreseeing, knowing well the ways thou goest.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The Maruts, they with whom thou sharedst Soma, Indra, who made thee strong and were thine army,—
With these accordant, eagerly desirous drink thou this Soma with the tongue of Agni.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Drink, Indra, of the juice by thine own nature, or by the tongue of Agni, O thou Holy.
Accept the sacrificial gift, O Śakra, from the Adhvaryu's hand or from the Hotar's.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,
The Strong, who listens, who.gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.

<span id="h36"></span>

## HYMN XXXVI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH constant succours, fain thyself to share it, make this oblation which we bring effective.
Grown great through strengthening gifts at each libation, he hath become renowned by mighty exploits.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For Indra were the Somas erst- discovered, whereby he grew strong-jointed, vast, and skilful.
Indra , take quickly these presented juices: drink of the strong, that which the strong have shaken.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Drink and wax great. Thine are the juices, Indra, both Somas of old time and these we bring thee.
Even as thou drankest, Indra, earlier Somas, so drink to-day, a new guest, meet for praises.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Great and impetuous, mighty-voiced in battle, surpassing power is his, and strength resistless.
Him the broad earth hath never comprehended when Somas cheered the Lord of Tawny Coursers.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Mighty and strong he waxed for hero exploit: the Bull was furnished a Sage's wisdom.
Indra is our kind Lord; his steers have vigour; his cows are many with abundant offspring.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  As floods according to their stream flow onward, so to the sea, as borne on cars, the waters.
Vaster is Indra even than his dwelling, what time the stalk milked out, the Soma, fills him.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Eager to mingle with the sea, the rivers carry the well-pressed Soma juice to Indra.
They drain the stalk out with their arms, quick-banded, and cleanse it with a stream of mead and filters.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Like lakes appear his flanks filled full with Soma: yea, he contains libations in abundance.
When Indra had consumed the first sweet viands, he, after slaying Vṛtra, claimed the Soma.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Then bring thou hither, and let none prevent it: we know thee well, the Lord of wealth and treasure.
That splendid gift which is thine own, O Indra, vouchsafe to us, Lord of the Tawny Coursers.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Indra, Maghavan, impetuous mover, grant us abundant wealth that brings all blessings.
Give us a hundred autumns for our lifetime: give us, O fair-checked Indra, store of heroes.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Call we on Indra, Maghavan, auspicious, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.

<span id="h37"></span>

## HYMN XXXVII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O INDRA, for the strength that slays Vṛtra and conquers in the fight,
We turn thee hitherward to us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Indra, Lord of Hundred Powers, may those who praise thee hitherward.
Direct thy spirit and thine eye.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Indra, Lord of Hundred Powers, with all our songs we invocate
Thy names for triumph over foes.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  We strive for glory through the powers immense of him whom many praise,
Of Indra who supports mankind.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For Vṛtra's slaughter I address Indra whom many invocate,
To win us booty in the wars.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In battles be victorious. We seek thee, Lord of Hundred Powers,
Indra, that Vṛtra may be slain.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  In splendid combats of the hosts, in glories where the fight is won.
Indra, be victor over foes.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Drink thou the Soma for our help, bright, vigilant, exceeding strong,
O Indra, Lord of Hundred Powers.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Śatakratu, powers which thou mid the Five Races hast displayed-
These, Indra, do I claim of thee.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Indra, great glory hast thou gained. Win splendid fame which none may mar
We make thy might perpetual.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Come to us either from anear, Or, Śakra, come from far away.
Indra, wherever be thy home, come to us thence, O Thunder-armed.

<span id="h38"></span>

## HYMN XXXVIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HASTING like some strong courser good at drawing, a thought have I imagined like a workman.
Pondering what is dearest and most noble, I long to see the sages full of wisdom.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ask of the sages' mighty generations firm-minded and devout they framed the heaven.
These are thy heart-sought strengthening directions, and they have come to be sky's upholders.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Assuming in this world mysterious natures, they decked the heaven and earth for high dominion,
Measured with measures, fixed their broad expanses, set the great worlds apart held firm for safety.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Even as he mounted up they all adorned him: self-luminous he travels clothed in splendour.
That is the Bull's, the Asura's mighty figure: he, omniform, hath reached the eternal waters.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  First the more ancient Bull engendered offspring; these are his many draughts that lent him vigour.
From days of old ye Kings, two Sons of Heaven, by hymns of sacrifice have won dominion.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Three seats ye Sovrans, in the Holy synod, many, yea, all, ye honour with your presence.
There saw I, going thither in the spirit, Gandharvas in their course with wind-blown tresses.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  That same companionship of her, the Milch-cow, here with the strong Bull's divers forms they stablished.
Enduing still some new celestial figure, the skilful workers shaped a form around him.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let no one here debar me from enjoying the golden light which Savitar diffuses.
He covers both all-fostering worlds with praises even as a woman cherishes her children.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Fulfil, ye twain, his work, the Great, the Ancient: as heavenly blessing keep your guard around us.
All the wise Gods behold his varied actions who stands erect, whose voice is like a herdsman's.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Call we on Indra, Maghavan, auspicious, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.

<span id="h39"></span>

## HYMN XXXIX. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To Indra from the heart the hymn proceedeth, to him the Lord, recited, built with praises;
The wakening song sung forth in holy synod: that which is born for thee, O Indra, notice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Born from the heaven e’en in the days aforetime, wakening, sting aloud in holy synod,
Auspicious, clad in white and shining raiment, this is the ancient hymn of our forefathers.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Mother of the Twins hath borne Twin Children: my tongue's tip raised itself and rested silent.
Killing the darkness at the light's foundation, the Couple newly born attain their beauty.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Not one is found among them, none of mortals, to blame our sires who fought to win the cattle.
Their strengthener was Indra the Majestic he spread their stalls of kine the Wonder-Worker.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Where as a Friend with friendly men, Navagvas, with heroes, on his knees he sought the cattle.
There, verily with ten Daśagvas Indra found the Sun lying hidden in the darkness.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Indra found meath collected in the milch-cow, by foot and hoof, in the cow's place of pasture.
That which lay secret, hidden in the waters, he held in his right hand, the rich rewarder.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He took the light, discerning it from darkness: may we be far removed from all misfortune.
These songs, O Soma-drinker, cheered by Soma, Indra, accept from thy most zealous poet.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let there be light through both the worlds for worship: may we be far from most overwhelming evil.
Great woe comes even from the hostile mortal, piled up; but good at rescue are the Vasus.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.

<span id="h40"></span>

## HYMN XL. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEE, Indra, we invoke, the Bull, what time the Soma is expressed.
So drink thou of the savoury juice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Indra, whom many laud, accept the strength-conferring Soma juice:
Quaff, pour down drink that satisfies.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra, with all the Gods promote our wealth-bestowing sacrifice,
Thou highly-lauded Lord of men.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Lord of the brave, to thee proceed these drops of Soma juice expressed,
The bright drops to thy dwelling-place.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Within thy belly, Indra, take juice, Soma the most excellent: Thine are the drops celestial.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Drink our libation, Lord of hymns: with streams of meath thou art bedewed
Our glory, Indra, is thy gift.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  To Indra go the treasures of the worshipper, which never fail:
He drinks the Soma and is strong
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  From far away, from near at hand, O Vṛtra-slayer, come to us:
Accept the songs we sing to thee.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  When from the space between the near and far thou art invoked by us,
Thence, Indra. come thou hitherward.
