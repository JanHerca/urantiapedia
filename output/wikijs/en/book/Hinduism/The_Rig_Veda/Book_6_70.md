## HYMN LXI. Sarasvatī.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To Vadhryasva when. be worshipped her with gifts she gave fierce Divodāsa, canceller of debts.
Consumer of the churlish niggard, one and all, thine, O Sarasvatī, are these effectual boons.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  She with her might, like one who digs for lotus-stems, hath burst with her strong waves the ridges of the hills.
Let us invite with songs and holy hymns for help Sarasvatī who slayeth the Paravatas.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thou castest down, Sarasvatī, those who scorned the Gods, the brood of every Bṛsaya skilled in magic arts.
Thou hast discovered rivers for the tribes of men, and, rich in wealth! made poison flow away from them.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May the divine Sarasvatī, rich in her wealth, protect us well,
Furthering all our thoughts with might
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whoso, divine Sarasvatī, invokes thee where the prize is set,
Like Indra when he smites the foe.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Aid us, divine Sarasvad, thou who art strong in wealth and power
Like Pūṣan, give us opulence.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yea, this divine Sarasvatī, terrible with her golden path,
Foe-slayer, claims our eulogy.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Whose limitless unbroken flood, swift-moving with a rapid rush,
Comes onward with tempestuous roar.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  She hath spread us beyond all foes, beyond her Sisters, Holy One,
As Sūrya spreadeth out the days.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Yea, she most dear amid dear stream, Seven-sistered, graciously inclined,
Sarasvatī hath earned our praise.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Guard us from hate Sarasvatī, she who hath filled the realms of earth,
And that wide tract, the firmament!
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Seven-sistered, sprung from threefold source, the Five Tribes' prosperer, she must be
Invoked in every deed of might.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Marked out by majesty among the Mighty Ones, in glory swifter than the other rapid Streams,
Created vast for victory like a chariot, Sarasvatī must be extolled by every sage.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Guide us, Sarasvatī, to glorious treasure: refuse us not thy milk, nor spurn us from thee.
Gladly accept our friendship and obedience: let us not go from thee to distant countries.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## HYMN LXII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I LAUD the Heroes Twain, this heaven's Controllers: singing with songs of praise I call the Aśvins,
Fain in a moment, when the morns are breaking, to part the earth's ends and the spacious regions.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Moving to sacrifice through realms of lustre they light the radiance of the car that bears them.
Traversing many wide unmeasured spaces, over the wastes ye pass, and fields, and waters.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Ye to that bounteous path of yours, ye mighty, have ever borne away our thoughts with horses,
Mind-swift and full of vigour, that the trouble of man who offers gifts might cease and slumber.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So ye, when ye have yoked your chariothorses, come to the hymn of the most recent singer.
Our true and ancient Herald Priest shall bring you, the Youthful, bearing splendour, food, and vigour.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  With newest hymn I call those Wonder-Workers, ancient and brilliant, and exceeding mighty,
Bringers of bliss to him who lauds and praises, bestowing varied bounties on the singer.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So ye, with birds, out of the sea and waters bore Bhujyu, son of Tugra, through the regions.
Speeding with winged steeds through dustless spaces, out of the bosom of the flood they bore him.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Victors, car-borne, ye rent the rock asunder: Bulls, heard the calling of the eunuch's consort.
Bounteous, ye filled the cow with milk for Śayu: thus, swift and zealous Ones, ye showed your favour.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Whate’er from olden time, Heaven, Earth! existeth great object of the wrath of Gods and mortals,
Make that, Ādityas, Vasus, sons of Rudra, an evil brand to one allied with demons.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  May he who knows, as Varuṇa and Mitra, air's realm, appointing both the Kings in season,
Against the secret fiend cast forth his weapon, against the lying words that strangers utter.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Come to our home with friendly wheels, for offipring; come on your radiant chariot rich in heroes.
Strike off, ye Twain, the heads of our assailants who with man's treacherous attack approach us.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Come hitherward to us with teams of horses, the highest and the midmost and the lowest.
Bountiful Lords, throw open to the singer doors e’en of the firm-closed stall of cattle.

## HYMN LXIII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHERE hath the hymn with reverence, like an envoy, found both fair Gods to-day, invoked of many-
Hymn that hath brought the two Nāsatyas hither? To this man's thought be ye, both Gods, most friendly.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Come readily to this mine invocation, lauded with songs, that ye may drink the juices.
Compass this house to keep it from the foeman, that none may force it, either near or distant.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Juice in wide room hath been prepared to feast you: for you the grass is strewn, most soft to tread on.
With lifted hands your servant hath adored you. Yearningfor you the press-stones shed the liquid.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni uplifts him at your sacrifices: forth goes the oblation dropping oil and glowing.
Up stands the grateful-minded priest, elected, appointed to invoke the two Nāsatyas.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Lords of great wealth! for glory, Sūrya's Daughter mounted your car that brings a hundred succours.
Famed for your magic arts were ye, magicians! amid the race of Gods, ye dancing Heroes!
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye Twain, with these your glories fair to look on, brought, to win victory, rich gifts for Sūrya.
After you flew your birds, marvels of beauty: dear to our hearts! the song, well lauded, reached you.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May your winged coursers, best to draw. Nāsatyas! convey you to the object of your wishes.
Swift as the thought, your car hath been sent onward to food of many a sort and dainty viands.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Lords of great wealth, manifold is your bounty: ye filled our cow with food that never faileth.
Lovers of sweetness! yours are praise and singers, and poured libations which have sought your favour.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Mine were two mares of Puraya, brown, swift-footed; a hundred with Sumidha, food with Peruk
Sanda gave ten gold-decked and well-trained horses, tame and obedient and of lofty stature.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Nāsatyas! Purupanthas offered hundreds, thousands of steeds to him who sang your praises,
Gave, Heroes! to the singer Bharadvāja. Ye-Wonder-Workers, let the fiends be slaughtered.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  May I with princes share your bliss in freedom.

## HYMN LXIV. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE radiant Dawns have risen up for glory, in their white splendour like the waves of waters.
She maketh paths all easy, fair to travel, and, rich, hath shown herself benign and friendly.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  We see that thou art good: far shines thy lustre; thy beams, thy splendours have flown up to heaven.
Decking thyself, thou makest bare thy bosom, shining in majesty, thou Goddess Morning.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Red are the kine and luminous that bear her the Blessed One who spreadeth through the distance.
The foes she chaseth like a valiant archer, like a swift warrior she repelleth darkness.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thy ways are easy on the hills: thou passest Invincible! Se1f-luminous! through waters.
So lofty Goddess with thine ample pathway, Daughter of Heaven, bring wealth to give us comfort.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Dawn, bring me wealth: untroubled, with thine oxen thou bearest riches at thy will and pleasure;
Thou who, a Goddess, Child of Heaven, hast shown thee lovely through bounty when we called thee early.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  As the birds fly forth from their restingplaces, so men with store of food rise at thy dawning.
Yea, to the liberal mortal who rernaineth at home, O Goddess Dawn, much good thou bringest.

## HYMN LXV. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SHEDDING her light on human habitations this Child of Heaven hath called us from our slumber;
She who at night-time with her argent lustre hath shown herself e’en through the shades of darkness.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  All this with red-rayed steeds have they divided: the Dawns on bright cars shine in wondrous fashion.
They, bringing near the stately rite's commencement, drive far away the night's surrounding shadows.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Dawns, bringing hither, to the man who worships, glory and power and might and food and vigour,
Opulent, with imperial sway like heroes, favour your servant and this day enrich him.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now is there treasure for the man who serves you, now for the hero, Dawns! who brings oblation;
Now for the singer when he sings the praise-song. Even to one like me ye brought aforetime.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Dawn who standest on the mountain ridges, Aṅgirases now praise thy stalls of cattle.
With prayer and holy hymn they burst them open: the heroes' calling on the Gods was fruitful.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Shine on us as of old, thou Child of Heaven,on him, rich Maid! who serves like Bharadvāja.
Give to the singer wealth with noble heroes, and upon us bestow wide-spreading glory.

## HYMN LXVI. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  E'EN to the wise let that be still a wonder to which the general name of Cow is given.
The one hath swelled among mankind for milking: Pṛśni hath drained but once her fair bright udder.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They who like kindled flames of fire are glowing,. the Maruts, twice and thrice have waxen mighty.
Golden and dustless were their cars, invested with their great strength and their heroic vigour.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They who are Sons of the rain-pouring Rudra, whom the long-lasting One had power to foster:
The Mighty Ones whose germ great Mother Pṛśni is known to have received for man's advantage.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They shrink not from the birth; in this same manner still resting there they purge away reproaches.
When they have streamed forth, brilliant, at their pleasure, with their own splendour they bedew their bodies.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Even those who bear the brave bold name of Maruts, whom not the active quickly wins for milking.
Even the liberal wards not off those fierce ones, those who are light and agile in their greatness.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When, strong in strength and armed with potent weapons, they had united wellformed earth and heaven,
Rodasl stood among these furious Heroes like splendour shining with her native brightness.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  No team of goats shall draw your car, O Maruts, no horse no charioteer be he who drives it.
Halting not, reinless, through the air it travels, speeding alone its paths through earth and heaven.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  None may obstruct, none overtake, O Maruts, him whom ye succour in the strife of battle
For sons and progeny, for kine and waters: he bursts the cow-stall on the day of trial.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Bring a bright hymn to praise the band of Maruts, the Singers, rapid, strong in native vigour,
Who conquer mighty strength with strength more mighty: earth shakes in terror at their wars, O Agni.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Bright like the flashing flames of sacrifices, like tongues of fire impetuous in their onset,
Chanting their psalm, singing aloud, like heroes, splendid from birth, invincible, the Maruts.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  That swelling band I call with invocation, the brood of Rudra, armed with glittering lances.
Pure hymns are meet for that celestial army: like floods and mountains have the Strong Ones battled.

## HYMN LXVIL Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  NOW Mitra-Varuṇa shall be exalted high by your songs, noblest of all existing;
They who, as ’twere with reins are best Controllers, unequalled with their arms to check the people.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To you Two Gods is this my thought extended, turned to the sacred grass with loving homage.
Give us, O Mitra-Varuṇa, a dwelling safe from attack, which ye shall guard, Boon-Givers!
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Come hither, Mitra-Varuṇa, invited with eulogies and loving adoration,
Ye who with your might, as Work-Controllers, urge even men who quickly hear to labour.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whom, of pure origin, like two strong horses, Aditi bore as babes in proper season,
Whom, Mighty at your birth, the Mighty Goddess brought forth as terrors to the mortal foeman.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As all the Gods in their great joy and gladness gave you with one accord your high dominion,
As ye surround both worlds, though wide and spacious your spies are ever true and never bewildered.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So, through the days maintaining princely power. ye prop the height as ’twere from loftiest heaven.
The Star of all the Gods, established, filleth the heaven and earth with food of man who liveth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Take the strong drink, to quaff till ye are sated, when he and his attendants fill the chamber.
The young Maids brook not that none seeks to win them, when, Quickeners of all! they scatter moisture.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So with your tongue come ever, when your envoy, faithful and very wise, attends our worship.
Nourished by holy oil! he this yGur glory: annihilate the sacrificer's trouble.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  When, Mitra-Varuṇa, they strive against you and break tlie friendly laws ye have established,
They, neither Gods nor men in estimation, like Api's sons have godless sacrifices.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When singers in their song uplift their voices, some chant the Nivid texts with steady purpose.
Then may we sing you lauds that shall be fruitful: dp ye not rival all the Gods in greatness?
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Mitra-Varuṇa, may your large bounty come to us hither, near to this our dwelling,
When the kine haste to us, and when they harness the fleet-foot mettled stallion for the battle.

## HYMN LXVIII. Indra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HIS honouring rite whose grass is trimmed is offered swiftly to you, in Manu's wise, accordant,
The rite which Indra-Varuṇa shall carry this day to high success and glorious issue.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For at Gods’ worship they are best through vigour; they have become the strongest of the Heroes;
With mighty strength, most liberal of the Princes, Chiefs of the host, by Law made Vṛtra's slayers.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Praise those Twain Gods for powers that merit worship, Indra and Varuṇa, for bliss, the joyous.
One with his might and thunderbolt slays Vṛtra; the other as a Sage stands near in troubles.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Though dames and men have waxen strong and mighty, and all the Gods selfpraised among the Heroes,
Ye, Indra-Varuṇa, have in might surpassed them, and thus were ye spread wide, O Earth and Heaven.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Righteous is he, and liberal and helpful who, Indra-Varuṇa, brings you gifts with gladness.
That bounteous man through food shall conquer faemen, and win him opulence and wealthy people.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  May wealth which ye bestow in food and treasure on him who brings you gifts and sacrifices,
Wealth, Gods! which breaks the curse of those who vex us, be, Indra-Varuṇa, e’en our own possession.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  So also, Indra-Varuṇa, may our princes have riches swift to save, with Gods to guard them-
They whose great might gives victory in battles, and their triumphant glory spreads with swiftness.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Indra. and Varuṇa, Gods whom we are lauding, mingle ye wealth with our heroic glory.
May we, who praise the strength of what is mighty, pass dangers, as with boats we cross the waters.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Now will I sing a dear and far-extending hymn to Varuṇa the God, sublime, imperial Lord,
Who, mighty Governor, Eternal, as with flame, illumines both wide worlds with majesty and power.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  True to Law, Indra-Varuṇa, drinkers of the juice, drink this pressed Soma which shall give you rapturous joy.
Your chariot cometh to the banquet of the Gods, to sacrifice, as it were home, that ye may drink.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Indra and Varuṇa, drink your fill, ye Heroes, of this invigorating sweetest Soma.
This juice is shed by us that ye may quaff it: on this trimmed grass be seated, and rejoice you

## HYMN LXIX. Indra-Viṣṇu

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDRA and Viṣṇu, at my task's completion I urge you on with food and sacred service.
Accept the sacrifice and grant us riches, leading us on by unobstructed pathways.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye who inspire all hymns, Indra and Viṣṇu, ye vessels who contain the Soma juices,
May hymns of praise that now are sung address you, the lauds that are recited by the singers.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Lords of joy-giving draughts, Indra and Viṣṇu, come, giving gifts of treasure, to the Soma.
With brilliant rays of hymns let chanted praises, repeated with the lauds, adorn and deck you.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May your foe-conquering horses bring you hither, Indra and Viṣṇu, sharers of the banquet.
Of all our hymns accept the invocations list to my prayers and hear the songs I sing you.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  This your deed, Indra-Viṣṇu, must be lauded: widely ye strode in the wild joy of Soma.
Ye made the firmament of larger compass, and made the regions broad for our existence.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Strengthened with sacred offerings, IndraViṣṇu, first eaters, served with worship ana oblation,
Fed with the holy oil, vouchsafe us riches ye are the lake, the vat that holds the Soma.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Drink of this meath, O Indra, thou, and Viṣṇu; drink ye your fill of Soma, Wonder-Workers.
The sweet exhilarating juice hath reached you. Hear ye my prayers, give ear unto my calling.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye Twain have conquered, ne’er have yc been conquered: never hath either of the Twain been vanquished.
Ye, Indra-Viṣṇu, when ye fought the battle, produced this infinite with three divisions.

## HYMN LXX. Heaven and Earth.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FILLED full of fatness, compassing all things that be, wide, spacious, dropping meath, beautiful in their form,
The Heaven and the Earth by Varuṇa's decree, unwasting, rich in germs, stand parted each from each.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Everlasting Pair, with full streams, rich in milk, in their pure rule pour fatness for the pious man.
Ye who are Regents of this world, O Earth and Heaven, pour into us the genial flow that prospers meit.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whoso, for righteous life, pours offerings to you, O Heaven and Earth, ye Hemispheres, that man succeeds.
He in his seed is born again and spreads by Law: from you flow things diverse in form, but ruled alike.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Enclosed in fatness, Heaven and Earth are bright therewith: they mingle with the fatness which they still increase.
Wide, broad, set foremost at election of the priest, to them the singers pray for bliss to further them.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May Heaven and Earth pour down the balmy rain for us, balm-dropping, yielding balm, with balm upon your path,
Bestowing by your Godhead sacrifice and wealth, great fame and strength for us and good heroic might.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  May Heaven and Earth make food swell plenteously for us, all-knowing Father, jother, wondrous in their works.
Pouring out bounties, may, in union, both the Worlds, all beneficial, send us gain, and power, and wealth.
