## HYMN LXXXI. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ADVANCING, sending forth her rays, the Daughter of the Sky is seen.
Uncovering, that we may see, the mighty gloom, the friendly Lady makes the light.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Sun ascending, the refulgent Star, pours down his beams together with the Dawn.
O Dawn, at thine arising, and the Sun's, may we attain the share allotted us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Promptly we woke to welcome thee, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky,
Thee, Bounteous One, who bringest all we long to have, and to the offerer health and wealth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou, dawning, workest fain to light the great world, yea, heaven, Goddess! that it may be seen.
We yearn to be thine own, Dealer of Wealth: may we be to this Mother like her sons.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Bring us that wondrous bounty, Dawn, that shall be famed most far away.
What, Child of Heaven, thou hast of nourishment for man, bestow thou on us to enjoy.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Give to our princes opulence and immortal fame, and strength in herds of kine to us.
May she who prompts the wealthy, Lady of sweet strains, may Uṣas dawn our foes away.

## HYMN LXXXIT. Indra-Varuṇa

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  GRANT us your strong protection, IndraVaruṇa, our people, and our family, for sacrifice.
May we subdue in fight our evil-hearted foes, him who attacks the man steadfast in lengthened rites.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, mighty and very rich One of you is called Monarch and One Autocrat.
All Gods in the most lofty region of the air have, O ye Steers, combined all power and might in you.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Ye with your strength have pierced the fountains of the floods: the Sun have ye brought forward as the Lord in heaven.
Cheered by this magic draught ye, Indra-Varuṇa, made the dry places stream, made songs of praise flow forth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  In battels and in frays we ministering priests, kneeling upon our knees for furtherance of our weal,
Invoke you, only you, the Lords of twofold wealth, you prompt to hear, we bards, O Indra-Varuṇa.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, as ye created all these creatures of the world by your surpassing might,
In peace and quiet Mitra waits on Varuṇa, the Other, awful, with the Maruis seeks renown.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  That Varuṇa's high worth may shine preeminent, these Twain have measured each his proper power and might.
The One subdueth the destructive enemy; the Other with a few furthereth many a man.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  No trouble, no misfortune, Indra-Varuṇa, no woe from any side assails the mortal man
Whose sacrifice, O Gods, ye visit and enjoy: ne’er doth the crafty guile of mortal injure him.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  With your divine protection, Heroes, come to us: mine invncation hear, if ye be pleased therewith.
Bestow ye upon us, O Indra-Varuṇa, your friendship and your kinship and your favouring grace.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  In battle after battle, Indra-Varuṇa, be ye our Champions, ye who are the peoples' strength,
When both opposing bands invoke you for the fight, and men that they may gain offspring and progeny.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman vouchsafe us glory and great shelter spreading far.
We think of the beneficent light of Aditi, and Savitar's song of praise, the God who strengthens Law.

<span id="h83"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIII. Indra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LOOKING to you and your alliance, O ye Men, armed with broad axes they went forward, fain for spoil.
Ye smote and slew his Dāsa and his Āryan enemies, and helped Sudās with favour, Indra-Varuṇa.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Where heroes come together with their banners raised, in the encounter where is naught for us to love,
Where all things that behold the light are terrified, there did ye comfort us, O Indra-Varuṇa.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The boundaries of earth were seen all dark with dust: O Indra-Varuṇa, the shout went up to heaven.
The enmities of the people compassed me about. Ye heard my calling and ye came to me with help.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  With your resistless weapons, Indra-Varuṇa, ye conquered Bheda and ye gave Sudās your aid.
Ye heard the prayers of these amid the cries of war: effectual was the service of the Trtsus' priest.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, the wickedness of foes and mine assailants' hatred sorely trouble me.
Ye Twain are Lords of riches both of earth and heaven: so grant to us your aid on the decisive day.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The men of both the hosts invoked you in the fight, Indra and Varuṇa, that they might win the wealth,
What time ye helped Sudās, with all the Trtsu folk, when the Ten Kings had pressed him down in their attack.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ten Kings who worshipped not, O Indra-Varuṇa, confederate, in war prevailed not o’er Sudās.
True was the boast of heroes sitting at the feast: so at their invocations Gods were on their side.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, ye gave Sudās your aid when the Ten Kings in battle compassed him about,
There where the white-robed Trtsus with their braided hair, skilled in song worshipped you with homage and with hymn.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  One of you Twain destroys the Vṛtras in the fight, the Other evermore maintains his holy Laws.
We call on you, ye Mighty, with our hymns of praise. Vouchsafe us your protection, Indra-Varuṇa.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman vouchsafe us glory and great shelter spreading far.
We think of the beneficent light of Aditi, and Savitar's song of praise, the God who strengthens Law.

<span id="h84"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIV. Indra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  KINGS, Indra-Varuṇa, I would turn you hither to this our sacrifice with gifts and homage.
Held in both arms the ladle, dropping fatness, goes of itself to you whose forms are varied.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Dyaus quickens and promotes your high dominion who bind with bonds not wrought of rope or cordage.
Far from us still be Varuṇa's displeasure may Indra give us spacious room to dwell in.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Make ye our sacrifice fair amid the assemblies: make ye our prayers approved among our princes.
May God-sent riches come for our possession: further ye us with your delightful succours.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Indra-Varuṇa, vouchsafe us riches with store of treasure, food, and every blessing;
For the Āditya, banisher of falsehood, the Hero, dealeth wealth in boundless plenty.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May this my song reach Varuṇa and Indra, and, strongly urging, win me sons and offspring.
To the Gods’ banquet may we go with riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h85"></span>

## HYMN LXXXV. Indra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FOR you I deck a harmless hymn, presenting the Soma juice to Varuṇa and Indra-
A hymn that shines like heavenly Dawn with fatness. May they be near us on the march and guard us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Here where the arrows fall amid the banners both hosts invoke the Gods in emulation.
O Indra-Varuṇa, smite back those-our foemen,yea, smite them withyour shaft to every quarter.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Self-lucid in their seats, e’en heavenly Waters endowed with Godhead Varuṇa and Indra.
One of these holds the folk distinct and sundered, the Other smites and slays resistless foemen.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wise be the priest and skilled in Law Eternal, who with his sacred gifts and oration.
Brings you to aid us with your might, Ādityas: let him have viands to promote his welfare.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May this my song reach Varuṇa and Indra, and, strongly urging, win me sons and offspring.
To the Gods’ banquet may we go with riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods with blessings.

<span id="h86"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVI. Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WISE, verily, are creatures through his greatness who stayed ever, spacious heaven and earth asunder;
Who urged the high and mighty sky to motion, the Star of old, and spread the earth before him.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With mine own heart I commune on the question how Varuṇa and I may be united.
What gift of mine will he accept unangered? When may I calmly look and find him gracious?
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Fain to know this is my sin I question others: I seek the wise, O Varuṇa, and ask them.
This one same answer even the sages gave me, “Surely this Varuṇa is angry with thee.”
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  What, Varuṇa, hath been my chief transgression, that thou wouldst slay the friend who sings thy praises?
Tell me, Unconquerable Lord, and quickly sinless will I approach thee with mine homage.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Free us from sins committed by our fathers, from those wherein we have ourselves offended.
O King, loose, like a thief who feeds the cattle, as from the cord a calf, set free Vasiṣṭha.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Not our own will betrayed us, but seduction, thoughtlessness, Varuṇa wine, dice, or anger.
The old is near to lead astray the younger: even sleep removeth not all evil-doing.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Slavelike may I do service to the Bounteous, serve, free from sin, the God inclined to anger.
This gentle Lord gives wisdom to the simple: the wiser God leads on the wise to riches.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Lord, O Varuṇa, may this laudation come close to thee and lie within thy spirit.
May it be well with us in rest and labour. Preserve us ever-more, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h87"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVII. Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  VARUNA cut a pathway out for Sūrya, and led the watery floods of rivers onward.
The Mares, as in a race, speed on in order. He made great channels for the days to follow.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The wind, thy breath, hath sounded through the region like a wild beast that seeks his food in pastures.
Within these two, exalted Earth and Heaven, O Varuṇa, are all the forms thou lovest.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Varuṇa's spies, sent forth upon their errand, survey the two world-halves well formed and fashioned.
Wise are they, holy, skilled in sacrifices, the furtherers of the praise-songs of the prudent.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To me who understand hath Varuṇa spoken, the names borne by the Cow are three times seven.
The sapient God, knowing the place's secret, shall speak as ’twere to teach the race that cometh.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  On him three heavens rest and are supported, and the three earths are there in sixfold order.
The wise King Varuṇa hath made in heaven that Golden Swing to cover it with glory.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Like Varuṇa from heaven he sinks in Sindhu, like a white-shining spark, a strong wild creature.
Ruling in depths and meting out the region, great saving power hath he, this world's Controller.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Before this Varuṇa may we be sinless him who shows mercy even to the sinner-
While we are keeping Aditi's ordinances. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h88"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVIII. Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  PRESENT to Varuṇa thine hymn, Vasiṣṭha, bright, most delightful to the Bounteous Giver,
Who bringeth on to us the Bull, the lofty, the Holy, laden with a thousand treasures.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And now, as I am come before his presence, I take the face of Varuṇa for Agni's.
So might he bring-Lord also of the darkness-the light in heaven that I may see its beauty!
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When Varuṇa and I embark together and urge our boat into the midst of ocean,
We, when we ride o’er ridges of the waters, will swing within that swing and there be happy.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Varuṇa placed Vasiṣṭha in the vessel, and deftly with his niight made him a Ṛṣi.
When days shone bright the Sage made him a singer, while the heavens broadened and the Dawns were lengthened.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What hath become of those our ancient friendships, when without enmity we walked together?
I, Varuṇa, thou glorious Lord, have entered thy lofty home, thine house with thousand portals.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  If he, thy true ally, hath sinned against thee, still, Varuṇa, he is the friend thou lovedst.
Let us not, Living One, as sinners I know thee: give shelter, as a Sage, to him who lauds thee.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  While we abide in these fixed habitations, and from the lap of Aditi win favour,
May Varuṇa untie the bond that binds us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

## HYMN LXXXIX Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET me not yet, King Varuṇa, enter into the house of clay:
Have mercy, spare me, Mighty Lord.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When, Thunderer! I move along tremulous like a wind-blown skin,
Have mercy, spare me, Mighty Lord.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Bright and Powerful God, through want of strength I erred and went astray
Have mercy, spare me, Mighty Lord.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thirst found thy worshipper though he stood in the midst of water-fijods:
Have mercy, spare me, Mighty Lord.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Varuṇa, whatever the offence may be which we as men commit against the heavenly host,
When through our want of thought we violate thy laws, punish us not, O God, for that iniquity.

## HYMN XC. Vāyu.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To you pure juice, rich in meath, are offered by priest: through longing for the Pair of Heroes.
Drive, Vāyu, bring thine harnessed horses hither: drink the pressed Soma till it make thee joyful.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Whoso to thee, the Mighty, brings oblation, pure Soma unto thee, pure-drinking Vāyu,
That man thou makest famous among mortals: to him strong sons are born in quick succession.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The God whom both these worlds brought forth for riches, whom heavenly Dhiṣaṇā for our wealth appointeth,
His team of harnessed horses waits on Vāyu, and, foremost, on the radiant Treasure-bearer.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The spotless Dawns with fair bright days have broken; they found the spacious light when they were shining.
Eagerly they disclosed the stall of cattle: floods streamed for them as in the days aforetime.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  These with their truthful spirit, shining brightly, move on provided with their natural insight.
Viands attend the car that beareth Heroes, your car, ye Sovran Pair, Indra and Vāyu.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  May these who give us heavenly light, these rulers, with gifts of kine and horses, gold and treasures.
These princes, through full life, Indra and Vāyu! o’ercome in battle with their steeds and heroes.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Like coursers seeking fame will we Vasisthas, O Indra-Vāyu, with our fair laudations.
Exerting all our power call you to aid us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
