## HYMN XLI. Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  NE’ER is he injured whom the Gods Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,
The excellently wise, protect.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He prospers ever, free from scathe, whom they, as with full hands, enrich,
Whom they preserve from every foe.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Kings drive far away from him his troubles and his enemies,
And lead him safely o’er distress.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thornless, Ādityas, is the path, easy for him who seeks the Law:
With him is naught to anger you.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What sacrifice, Ādityas, ye Heroes guide by the path direct,—
May that come nigh unto your thought.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  That mortal, ever unsubdued, gains wealth and every precious thing,
And children also of his own.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  How, my friends, shall we prepare Aryaman's and Mitra's laud,
Glorious food of Varuṇa?
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  I point not out to you a man who strikes the pious, or reviles:
Only with hymns I call you nigh.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Let him not love to speak ill words: but fear the One who holds all four
Within his hand, until they fall.

<span id="h42"></span>

## HYMN XLII. Pūṣan.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SHORTEN our ways, O Pūṣan, move aside obstruction in the path:
Go close before us, cloud-born God.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Drive, Pūṣan, from our road the wolf, the wicked inauspicious wolf,
Who lies in wait to injure us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Who lurks about the path we take, the robber with a guileful heart:
Far from the road chase him away.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Tread with thy foot and trample out the firebrand of the wicked one,
The double-tongued, whoe’er he be.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wise Pūṣan, Wonder-Worker, we claim of thee now the aid wherewith
Thou furtheredst our sires of old.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So, Lord of all prosperity, best wielder of the golden sword,
Make riches easy to be won.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Past all pursuers lead us, make pleasant our path and fair to tread:
O Pūṣan, find thou power for this.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Lead us to meadows rich in grass: send on our way no early heat:
O Pūṣan, find thou power for this.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Be gracious to us, fill us full, give, feed us, and invigorate:
O Pūṣan, find thou power for this.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  No blame have we for Pūṣan; him we magnify with songs of praise:
We seek the Mighty One for wealth.

<span id="h43"></span>

## HYMN XLIII. Rudra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHAT shall we sing to Rudra, strong, most bounteous, excellently wise,
That shall be dearest to his heart?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  That Aditi may grant the grace of Rudra to our folk, our kine,
Our cattle and our progeny;
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  That Mitra and that Varuṇa, that Rudra may remember us,
Yea, all the Gods with one accord.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To Rudra Lord of sacrifice, of hymns and balmy medicines,
We pray for joy and health and strength.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He shines in splendour like the Sun, refulgent as bright gold is he,
The good, the best among the Gods.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  May he grant health into our steeds, wellbeing to our rams and ewes,
To men, to women, and to kine.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Soma, set thou upon us the glory of a hundred men,
The great renown of mighty chiefs.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let not malignities, nor those who trouble Soma, hinder us.
Indu, give us a share of strength.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Soma! head, central point, love these; Soma! know these as serving thee,
Children of thee Immortal, at the highest place of holy law.

<span id="h44"></span>

## HYMN XLIV. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  IMMORTAL Jātavedas, thou many-hued fulgent gift of Dawn,
Agni, this day to him who pays oblations bring the Gods who waken with the morn.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For thou art offering-bearer and loved messenger, the charioteer of sacrifice:
Accordant with the Aśvins and with Dawn grant us heroic strength and lofty fame.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As messenger we choose to-day Agni the good whom many love,
Smoke-bannered spreader of the light, at break of day glory of sacrificial rites.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Him noblest and most youthful, richly worshipped guest, dear to the men who offer gifts,
Him, Agni Jātavedas, I beseech at dawn that he may bring the Gods to us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thee, Agni, will I glorify, deathless nourisher of the world,
Immortal, offering-bearer, meet for sacred food, preserver, best at sacrifice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Tell good things to thy praiser, O most youthful God, as richly worshipped, honey-tongued,
And, granting to Praskaṇva lengthened days of life, show honour to the Heavenly Host.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For the men, Agni, kindle thee as all possessor and as Priest;
So Agni, much-invoked, bring hither with all speed the Gods, the excellently wise,
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  At dawn of day, at night, Uṣas and Savitar, the Aśvins, Bhaga, Agni's self:
Skilled in fair rites, with Soma poured, the Kaṇvas light thee, the oblation-wafting God.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For, Agni, Lord of sacrifice and messenger of men art thou:
Bring thou the Gods who wake at dawn who see the light, this day to drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thou shonest forth, O Agni, after former dawns, all visible, O rich in light.
Thou art our help in battle-strife, the Friend of man, the great high priest in sacrifice.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Like Manu, we will stablish thee, Agni, performer of the rite,
Invoker, ministering Priest, exceeding wise, the swift immortal messenger.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  When as the Gods’ High Priest, by many loved, thou dost their mission as their nearest Friend,
Then, like the far-resounding billows of the flood, thy flames, O Agni, roar aloud.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Hear, Agni, who hast ears to hear, with all thy train of escort Gods;
Let Mitra, Aryaman, seeking betimes our rite, seat them upon the sacred grass.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Let those who strengthen Law, who bountifully give, the life-tongued Maruts, hear our praise.
May Law-supporting Varuṇa with the Aśvins twain and Uṣas, drink the Soma juice.

<span id="h45"></span>

## HYMN XLV. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WORSHIP the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras, the Ādityas, all
Who spring from Manu, those who know fair rites, who pour their blessings down.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Agni, the Gods who understand give ear unto the worshipper:
Lord of Red Steeds, who lovest song, bring thou those Three-and-Thirty Gods.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Jātavedas, great in act, hearken thou to Praskaṇva's call,
As Priyamedha erst was heard, Atri, Virūpa, Aṅgiras.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The sons of Priyamedha skilled in lofty praise have called for help
On Agni who with fulgent flame is Ruler of all holy rites.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Hear thou, invoked with holy oil, bountiful giver of rewards,
These eulogies, whereby the sons of Kaṇva call thee to their aid.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O Agni, loved by many, thou of fame most wondrous, in their homes
Men call on thee whose hair is flame, to be the bearer of their gifts.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thee, Agni, best to find out wealth, most widely famous, quick to hear,
Singers have stablished in their rites Herald and ministering Priest.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Singers with Soma pressed have made thee, Agni, hasten to the feast,
Great light to mortal worshipper, what time they bring the sacred gift.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Good, bounteous, Son of Strength, this day seat here on sacred grass the Gods
Who come at early morn, the host of heaven, to drink the Soma juice
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host:
Here stands the Soma, bounteous Gods drink this expressed ere yesterday.

<span id="h46"></span>

## HYMN XLVI. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now Morning with her earliest light shines forth, dear Daughter of the Sky:
High, Aśvins, I extol your praise,
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sons of the Sea, mighty to save discoverers of riches, ye
Gods with deep thought who find out wealth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Your giant coursers hasten on over the region all in flames,
When your car flies with winged steeds.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He, liberal, lover of the flood, Lord of the House, the vigilant,
Chiefs! with oblations feeds you full.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ye have regard unto our hymns, Nāsatyas, thinking of our words:
Drink boldly of the Soma juice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Vouchsafe to us, O Aśvin Pair, such strength as, with attendant light,
May through the darkness carry us.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Come in the ship of these our hymns to bear you to the hither shore
O Aśvins, harness ye the car.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The heaven's wide vessel is your own on the flood's shore your chariot waits
Drops, with the hymn, have been prepared.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Kaṇvas, the drops are in the heaven; the wealth is at the waters' place:
Where will ye manifest your form?
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Light came to lighten up the branch, the Sun appeared as it were gold:
And with its tongue shone forth the dark.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The path of sacrifice was made to travel to the farther goal:
The road of heaven was manifest.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The singer of their praise awaits whatever grace the Aśvins give,
who save when Soma gladdens them.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Ye dwellers with Vivasvān come, auspicious, as to Manu erst;
come to the Soma and our praise.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  O circumambient Aśvins, Dawn follows the brightness of your way:
Approve with beams our solemn rites.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Drink ye of our libations, grant protection, O ye Aśvins Twain,
With aids which none may interrupt.

<span id="h47"></span>

## HYMN XLVII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AŚVINS, for you who strengthen Law this sweetest Soma hath been shed.
Drink this expressed ere yesterday and give riches to him who offers it.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Come, O ye Aśvins, mounted on your triple car three-seated, beautiful of form
To you at sacrifice the Kaṇvas send the prayer: graciously listen to their call.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Aśvins, ye who strengthen Law, drink ye this sweetest Soma juice.
Borne on your wealth-fraught car come ye this day to him who offers, ye of wondrous deeds.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Omniscient Aśvins, on the thrice-heaped grass bedew with the sweet juice the sacrifice.
The sons of Kaṇva, striving heavenward, call on you with draughts of Soma juice out-poured.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Aśvins, with those aids wherewith ye guarded Kaṇva carefully,
Keep us, O Lords of Splendour: drink the Soma juice, ye strengtheners of holy law.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  O Mighty Ones, ye gave Sudās abundant food, brought on your treasure-laden car;
So now vouchsafe to us the wealth which many crave, either from heaven or from the sea.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Nāsatyas, whether ye be far away or close to Turvaśa,
Borne on your lightly-rolling chariot come to us, together with the sunbeams come.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So let your coursers, ornaments of sacrifice, bring you to our libations here.
Bestowing food on him who acts and gives aright, sit, Chiefs, upon the sacred grass.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Come, O Nāsatyas, on your car decked with a sunbright canopy,
Whereon ye ever bring wealth to the worshipper, to drink the Soma's pleasant juice.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  With lauds and songs of praise we call them down to us, that they, most rich, may succour us;
For ye have ever in the Kaṇvas' well-loved house, O Aśvins, drunk the Soma juice.

<span id="h48"></span>

## HYMN XLVIII. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  DAWN on us with prosperity, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky,
Dawn with great glory, Goddess, Lady of the Light, dawn thou with riches, Bounteous One.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They, bringing steeds and kine, boon-givers of all wealth, have oft sped forth to lighten us.
O Uṣas, waken up for me the sounds of joy: send us the riches of the great.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Uṣas hath dawned, and now shall dawn, the Goddess, driver forth of cars
Which, as she cometh nigh, have fixed their thought on her, like glory-seekers on the flood.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Here Kaṇva, chief of Kaṇva's race, sings forth aloud the glories of the heroes’ names,—
The. princes who, O Uṣas, as thou comest near, direct their thoughts to liberal gifts.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Like a good matron Uṣas comes carefully tending everything:
Rousing all life she stirs all creatures that have feet, and makes the birds of air fly up.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  She sends the busy forth, each man to his pursuit: delay she knows not as she springs.
O rich in opulence, after thy dawning birds that have flown forth no longer rest.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  This Dawn hath yoked her steeds afar, beyond the rising of the Sun:
Borne on a hundred chariots she, auspicious Dawn, advances on her way to Men.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To meet her glance all living creatures bend them down: Excellent One, she makes the light.
Uṣas, the Daughter of the Sky, the opulent, shines foes and enmities away.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Shine on us with thy radiant light, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky,
Bringing to us great store of high felicity, and beaming on our solemn rites.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For in thee is each living creature's breath and life, when, Excellent! thou dawnest forth.
Borne on thy lofty car, O Lady of the Light, hear, thou of wondrous wealth, our call.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Uṣas, win thyself the strength which among men is wonderful.
Bring thou thereby the pious unto holy rites, those who as priests sing praise to thee.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Bring from the firmament, O Uṣas, all the Gods, that they may drink our Soma juice,
And, being what thou art, vouchsafe us kine and steeds, strength meet for praise and hero might.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  May Uṣas whose auspicious rays are seen resplendent round about,
Grant us great riches, fair in form, of all good things, wealth which light labour may attain.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Mighty One, whom the Ṛṣis of old time invoked for their protection and their help,
O Uṣas, graciously answer our songs of praise with bounty and with brilliant light.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Uṣas, as thou with light to day hast opened the twin doors of heaven,
So grant thou us a dwelling wide and free from foes. O Goddess, give us food with kine.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Bring us to wealth abundant, sent in every shape, to plentiful refreshing food,
To all-subduing splendour, Uṣas, Mighty One, to strength, thou rich in spoil and wealth.

<span id="h49"></span>

## HYMN XLIX. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  E'EN from above the sky's bright realm come, Uṣas, by auspicious ways:
Let red steeds bear thee to the house of him who pours the Soma, juice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The chariot which thou mountest, fair of shape, O Uṣas light to move,—
Therewith, O Daughter of the Sky, aid men of noble fame today.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bright Uṣas, when thy times return, all quadrupeds and bipeds stir,
And round about flock winged birds from all the boundaries of heaven.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou dawning with thy beams of light illumest all the radiant realm.
Thee, as thou art, the Kaṇvas, fain for wealth, have called with sacred songs.

<span id="h50"></span>

## HYMN L. Sūrya.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HIS bright rays bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that lives,
Sūrya, that all may look on him.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The constellations pass away, like thieves, together with their beams,
Before the all-beholding Sun.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  His herald rays are seen afar refulgent o’er the world of men,
Like flames of fire that burn and blaze.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Swift and all beautiful art thou, O Sūrya, maker of the light,
Illuming all the radiant realm.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou goest to the hosts of Gods, thou comest hither to mankind,
Hither all light to be beheld.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  With that same eye of thine wherewith thou lookest brilliant Varuṇa,
Upon the busy race of men,
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Traversing sky and wide mid-air, thou metest with thy beams our days,
Sun, seeing all things that have birth.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Seven Bay Steeds harnessed to thy car bear thee, O thou farseeing One,
God, Sūrya, with the radiant hair.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Sūrya hath yoked the pure bright Seven, the daughters of the car; with these,
His own dear team, he goeth forth.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Looking upon the loftier light above the darkness we have come
To Sūrya, God among the Gods, the light that is most excellent.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Rising this day, O rich in friends, ascending to the loftier heaven,
Sūrya remove my heart's disease, take from me this my yellow hue.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  To parrots and to starlings let us give away my yellowness,
Or this my yellowness let us transfer to Haritāla trees.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  With all his conquering vigour this Āditya hath gone up on high,
Giving my foe into mine hand: let me not be my foeman's prey.
