## HYMN LI. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH all assistants, Agni, come hither to drink the Soma-juice;
With Gods unto our sacred gifts.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Come to the sacrifice, O ye whose ways are right, whose laws are true,
And drink the draught with Agni's tongue.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Singer, with the singers, O Gracious, with those who move at dawn,
Come to the Soma-draught with Gods.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To Indra and to Vāyu dear, this Soma, by the mortar pressed,
Is now poured forth to fill the jar.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Vāyu, come hither to the feast, wellpleased unto our sacred gifts:
Drink of the Soma juice effused come to the food.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye, Indra, Vāyu, well deserve to drink the juices pressed by us.
Gladly accept them, spotless Pair come to the food.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For Indra and for Vāyu pressed are Soma juices blent with curd,
As rivers to the lowland flow: come to the food.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Associate with all the Gods, come, with the Aśvins and with Dawn,
Agni, as erst with Atri, so enjoy the juice.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Associate with Varuṇa, with Mitra, Soma, Viṣṇu, come,
Agni, as erstwith Atri, so enjoy the juice.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Associate with Vasus, with Ādityas, Indra, Viyu, come, Agni as erst with Atri, so enjoy the juice.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  May Bhaga and the Aśvins grant us health and wealth, and Goddess Adid and he whom none resist.
The Asura Pūṣan grant us all prosperity, and Heaven and Earth most wise vouchsafe us happiness.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let us solicit Vāyu for prosperity, and Soma who is Lord of all the world for weal;
For weal Bṛhaspati with all his company. May the Ādityas bring us health and happiness.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  May all the Gods, may Agni the beneficent, God of all men, this day be with us for our weal.
Help us the Ṛbhus, the Divine Ones, for our good. May Rudra bless and keep us from calamity.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Prosper us, Mitra, Varuṇa. O wealthy Pathya, prosper us.
Indra and Agni, prosper us; prosper us thou, O Aditi.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Like Sun and Moon may we pursue in full prosperity our path,
And meet with one who gives again, -who knows us well and slays us not.

## HYMN LII Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SING boldly forth, Śyāvāśva, with the Maruts who are loud in song,
Who, holy, as their wont is, joy in glory that is free from guile.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For in their boldness they are friends of firm and sure heroic strength.
They in their course, bold-spirited, guard all men of their own accord.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Like steers in rapid motion they advance and overtake the nights;
And thus the Maruts’ power in heaven and on the earth we celebrate.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  With boldness to your Maruts let us offer laud and sacrifice:
Who all, through ages of mankind, guard mortal man from injury.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Praiseworthy, givers of good gifts, Heroes with full and perfect strength -
To Maruts, Holy Ones of heaven, will I extol the sacrifice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The lofty Heroes cast their spears and weapons bright with gleaming gold.
After these Maruts followed close, like laughing lightning from the sky, a splendour of its own accord.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They who waxed mighty, of the earth, they who are in the wide mid-air,
Or in the rivers’ compass, or in the abode of ample heaven.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Praise thou the Maruts’ company, the valorous and truly strong,
The Heroes, hasting, by themselves have yoked their deer for victory.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Fair-gleaming, on Paruṣṇī they have clothed themselves in robes of wool,
And with their chariot tires they cleave the rock asunder in their might.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Whether as wanderers from the way or speeders on or to the path,
Under these names the spreading band tend well the sacrifice for me.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  To this the Heroes well attend, well do their teams attend to this.
Visible are their varied forms. Behold, they are Paravatas.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Hymn-singing, seeking water, they, praising, have danced about the spring.
What are they unto me? No thieves, but helpers, splendid to behold.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Sublime, with lightnings for their spears, Sages and Orderers are they.
Ṛṣi, adore that Marut host, and make them happy with thy song.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Ṛṣi, invite the Marut band with offerings, as a maid her friend.
From heaven, too, Bold Ones, in your might haste hither glorified with songs.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thinking of these now let him come, as with the escort of the Gods,
And with the splendid Princes, famed for rapid courses, to the gifts.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Princes, who, when I asked their kin, named Pṛśni as their Mother-cow,
And the impetuous Rudra they, the Mighty Ones, declared their Sire.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  The mighty ones, the seven times seven, have singly given me hundred gifts.
I have obtained on Yamuna famed wealth in kine and wealth in steeds.

## HYMN LIII. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Who knows the birth of these, or who lived in the Maruts’ favour in the days of old
What time their spotted deer were yoked?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Who, when they stood upon their cars, hath heard them tell the way they went?
Who was the bounteous man to whom their kindred rains flowed down with food of sacrifice?
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  To me they told it, and they came with winged steeds radiant to the draught,
Youths, Heroes free from spot or stain: Behold us here and praise thou us;
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Who shine self-luminous with ornaments and swords, with breastplates, armlets, and with wreaths,
Arrayed on chariots and with bows.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O swift to pour your bounties down, ye Maruts, with delight I look upon your cars,
Like splendours coming through the rain.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Munificent Heroes, they have cast heaven's treasury down for the worshipper's behoof:
They set the storm-cloud free to stream through both the worlds, and rainfloods flow o’er desert spots.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The bursting streams m billowy flood have spread abroad, like milch-kine, o’er the firmament.
Like swift steeds hasting to their journey's resting-place, to every side run glittering brooks.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Hither, O Maruts, come from heaven, from mid-air, or from near at hand
Tarry not far away from us.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  So let not Rasā, Krumu, or Anitabha, Kubha, or Sindhu hold you back.
Let not the watery Sarayti obstruct your way. With us be all the bliss ye give.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  That brilliant gathering of your cars, the company of Maruts, of the Youthful Ones,
The rain-showers, speeding on, attend.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  With eulogies and hymns may we follow your army, troop by troop, and band by band,
And company by company.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  To what oblation-giver, sprung of noble ancestry, have sped
The Maruts on this course to-day?
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Vouchsafe to us the bounty, that which we implore, through which, for child and progeny,
Ye give the seed of corn that wasteth not away, and bliss that reacheth to all life.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  May we in safety pass by those who slander us, leaving behind disgrace and hate.
Maruts, may we be there when ye, at dawn, in rest and toil, rain waters down and balm.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Favoured by Gods shall he the man, O Heroes, Marutr! and possessed of noble sons,
Whom ye protect. Such may we be.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Praise the Free-givers. At this liberal patron's rite they joy like cattle in the mead.
So call thou unto them who come as ancient Friends: hymn those who love thee with a song.

## HYMN LIV. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THIS hymn will I make for the Marut host who bright in native splendour cast the mountains down.
Sing the great strength of those illustrious in renown, who stay the heat, who sacrifice on heights of heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Maruts, rich in water, strengtheners of life are your strong bands with harnessed steeds, that wander far.
Trita roars out at him who aims the lightning-flash. The waters sweeping round are thundering on their way.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They gleam with lightning, Heroes, Casters of the Stone, wind-rapid Maruts, overthrowers of the bills,
Oft through desire to rain coming with storm of hail, roaring in onset, violent and exceeding strong.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When, mighty Rudras, through the nights and through the days, when through the sky and realms of air, shakers of all,
When over the broad fields ye drive along like ships, e’en to strongholds ye come, Maruts, but are not harmed.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Maruts, this hero strength and majesty of yours hath, like the Sun, extended o’er a lengthened way,
When in your course like deer with splendour unsubdued ye bowed the hill that gives imperishable rain.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Bright shone your host, ye Sages, Maruts, when ye smote the waving tree as when the worm consumeth it.
Accordant, as the eye guides him who walks, have ye led our devotion onward by an easy path.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Never is he, O Maruts, slain or overcome, never doth he decay ne’er is distressed or harmed;
His treasures, his resources, never waste away, whom. whether he be prince or Ṛṣi, ye direct.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  With harnessed team like heroes overcoming troops, the friendly Maruts, laden with their water-casks,
Let the spring flow, and when impetuous' they roar they inundate the earth with floods of pleasant meath.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Free for the Maruts is the earth with sloping ways, free for the rushing Ones is heaven with steep descents.
The paths of air's mid-region are precipitous, precipitous the mountains with their running streams.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When, as the Sun hath risen up, ye take delight, O bounteous radiant Maruts, Heroes of the sky,
Your coursers weary not when speeding onṭheir way, and rapidly ye reach the end of this your path.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Lances are on your shoulders, anklets on your feet, gold chains are on your breasts, gems, Maruts, on your car.
Lightnings aglow with flame are flashing in your hands, and visors wroughtof gold are laid upon your heads.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Maruts, in eager stir ye shake the vault of heaven, splendid beyond conception, for its shining fruit.
They gathered when they let their deeds of might flash forth. The Pious Ones send forth a far-resounding shout.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Sage Maruts, may we be the drivers of the car of riches ful I of life that have been given by you.
O Maruts, let that wealth in thousands dwell with us which never vanishes like Tisya from the sky.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Maruts, ye further wealth with longedfor heroes, further the Ṛṣi skilled in chanted verses.
Ye give the Bhārata as his strength, a charger, and ye bestow a king who quickly listens.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Of you, most swift to succour! I solicit wealth wherewith we may spread forth mid men like as the Sun.
Accept, O Maruts, graciously this hymn of mine that we may live a hundred winters through its power.

## HYMN LV. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH gleaming lances, with their breasts adorned with gold, the Maruts, rushing onward, hold high power of life.
They hasten with swift steeds easy to be controlled. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Ye, as ye wist, have gained of your own selves your power: high, O ye Mighty Ones, and wide ye shine abroad.
They with their strength have even measured out the sky.
Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Strong, born together, they together have waxed great: the Heroes more and more have grown to majesty
Resplendent as the Sun's beams in their light are they. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Maruts, your mightiness deserves to be adored, sight to be longed for like the shining of the Sun.
So lead us with your aid to immortality.
Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Maruts, from the Ocean ye uplift the rain, and fraught with vaporous moisture pour the torrents down.
Never, ye Wonder-Workers, are your Milch-kine dry. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When to your car-poles ye have yoked your spotted deer to be your steeds, and put your golden mantles on,
O Maruts, ye disperse all enemies abroad. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Neither the mountains nor the rivers keep you back: whither ye have resolved thither ye, Maruts, go.
Ye compass round about even the heaven and earth. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
Whate’er is ancient, Maruts, what of recent time, whate’er is spoken, Vasus, what is chanted forth,
They who take cognizance of all of this are ye. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Be gracious unto us, ye Maruts, slay us not extend ye unto us shelter of many a sort.
Pay due regard unto our friendship and our praise. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Maruts, lead us on to higher fortune deliver us, when lauded, from afflictions.
Accept, ye Holy Ones, the gifts we bring you. May we be masters of abundant riches.

## HYMN LVI. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AGNI, that valorous company adorned with ornaments of gold,
The people of the Maruts, I call down to-day even from the luminous realm of heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Even as thou thinkest in thy heart, thither my wishes also tend.
Those who have come most near to thine invoking calls, strengthen them fearful to behold.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Earth, like a bounteous lady, liberal of her gifts, struck down and shaken, yet exultant, comes to us.
Impetuous as a bear, O Maruts, is youi rush terrible as a dreadful bull..
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They who with mighty strength o’erthrow like oxen difficult to yoke,
Cause e’en the heavenly stone to shake ' yea, shake the rocky mountain as they race along.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Rise up! even now with lauds I call the very numerous company,
Unequalled, of these Maruts, like a herd of kine, grown up together in their strength.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Bind to your car the bright red mares, yoke the red coursers to your car.
Bind to the pole, to draw, the fleet-foot tawny steeds, the best at drawing, to the pole.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yea, and this loudly-neighing bright red vigorous horse who hath been sutioned, fair to see,
Let him not cause delay, O Maruts,, in your course, urge ye him onward in your cars.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The Maruts’ chariot, ever fain to gather glory, we invoke,
Which Rodasī hath mounted, bringing pleasant gifts, with Maruts in her company.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I call that brilliant band of yours, adorable, rapid on the car
Whereon the bounteous Dame, auspicious, nobly born, shows glorious with the Marut host.

## HYMN LVII. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  OF one accord, with Indra, O ye Rudras, come borne on your golden car for our prosperity.
An offering from us, this hymn is brought to you, as, unto one who th irsts for water, heavenly springs.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Armed with your daggers, full of wisdom, armed with spears, armed with your quivers, armed with arrows, with good bows,
Good horses and good cars have ye, O Pṛśni's Sons: ye, Maruts, with good weapons go to victory.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  From hills and heaven ye shake wealth for the worshipper: in terror at your coming low the woods bow down.
Ye make the earth to tremble, Sons of Pṛśni, when for victory ye have yoked, fierce Ones! your spotted deer.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Bright with the blasts of wind, wrapped in their robes of rain, like twins of noble aspect and of lovely form,
The Maruts, spotless, with steeds tawnyhued and red, strong in their mightiness and spreading wide like heaven.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Rich in adornment, rich in drops, munificent, bright in their aspect, yielding bounties that endure,
Noble by birth, adorned with gold upon their breasts, the Singers of the sky have won immortal fame.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Borne on both shoulders, O ye Maruts, are your spears: within your arms is laid your energy and 3trength.
Bold thoughts are in your heads, your weapons in your cars, all glorious majesty is moulded on your forms.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Vouchsafe to us, O Maruts, splendid bounty in cattle and in steeds, in cars and heroes.
Children of Rudra, give us high distinction: may I enjoy your Godlike help and favour.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ho! Maruts, Heroes, skilled in Law, immortal, be gracious unto us, ye rich in treasures,
Ye hearers of the truth, ye sage and youthful, grown mighty, dwelling on the lofty mountains.

## HYMN LVIII. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now do I glorify their mighty cohort, the company of these the youthful Maruts,
Who ride impetuous on with rapid horses, and radiant in themselves, are Lords of Amṛta.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The mighty glittering band, arm-bound with bracelets, givers of bliss, unmeasured in their greatness,
With magical powers, bountiful, ever-roaring,—these, liberal Heroes, venerate thou singer.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  This day may all your water-bringers, Maruts, they who impel the falling rain, approach us.
This fire, O Maruts, hath been duly kindled; let it find favour with you, youthful Sages.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ye raise up for the folk an active ruler whom, Holy Ones! a Master's hand hath fashioned.
Ye send the fighter hand to hand, armmighty, and the brave hero, Maruts with good horses.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They spring forth more and more, strong in their glories, like days, like spokes where none are last in order.
Highest and mightiest are the Sons of Pṛśni. Firm to their own intention cling the Maruts.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When ye have hastened on with spotted coursers, O Maruts, on your cars with strong-wrought fellies,
The waters are disturbed, the woods are shattered. Let Dyaus the Red Steer send his thunder downward.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Even Earth hath spread herself wide at their coming, and they as husbands have with power impregned her.
They to the pole have yoked the winds for coursers: their sweat have they made rain, these Sons of Rudra.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ho! Maruts, Heroes, skilled in Law, immortal, be gracious unto us, ye rich in treasures,
Ye hearers of the truth, ye sage and youthful, grown mighty, dwelling on the lofty mountains.

## HYMN LIX. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YOUR spy hath called to you to give prosperity. I sing to Heaven and Earth and offer sacrifice.
They bathe their steeds and hasten through the firmament: they spread abroad their radiance through the sea of cloud.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Earth shakes and reels in terror at their onward rush, like a full ship which, quivering, lets the water in.
Marked on their ways are they, visible from afar: the Heroes press between in mighty armament.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As the exalted horn of bulls for splendid might, as the Sun's eye set in the firmament's expanse,
Like vigorous horses ye are beauteous to behold, and for your glory show like bridegrooms, O ye Men.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Who, O ye Maruts, may attain the mighty lore of you the mighty, who may reach your manly deeds?
Ye, verily, make earth tremble like a ray of light what time ye bring your boons to give prosperity,
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Like steeds of ruddy colour, scions of one race, as foremost champions they have battled in the van.
The Heroes have waxed strong like we.1grown manly youths; with floods of rain they make the Sun's eye fade away,
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Having no eldest and no youngest in their band, no middlomost, preeminent they have waxed in might,
These Sons of Pṛśni, sprung of noble ancestry: come hitberward to us, ye bridegrooms of the sky.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Like birds of air they flew with might in lengthened lines from heaven's high ridges to the borders of the sky.
The steeds who carry them, as Gods and mortals know, have caused the waters of the mounuains to desGend.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  May Dyaus, the Infinite, roar for our banquet: may Dawns toil for us, glittering with moisture.
Lauded by thee, these Maruts, Sons o Rudra, O Ṛṣi, have sent down the heavenly treasure.

## HYMN LX. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I LAUD with reverence the gracious Agni: here may he sit and part our meed among us.
As with spoil-seeking cars I bring oblation: turned rightward I will swell the Marut's, praise-song.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Maruts, yea, the Rudras, who have mounted their famous spotted deer and cars swift-moving,—
Before you, fierce Ones! woods bow down in terror: Earth, even the mountain, trembles at your coming.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Though vast and tall, the mountain is affrighted, the height of heaven is shaken at your roaring
When, armed with lances, ye are sporting, Maruts, and rush along together like the waters.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They, like young suitors, sons of wealthy houses, have with their golden natures decked their bodies.
Strong on their cars, the lordly Ones, for glory, have set their splendours on their forms for ever.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  None being eldest, none among them youngest, as brothers they have grown to happy fortune.
May their Sire Rudra, young and deft, and Pṛśni pouring much milk, bring fair days to the Maruts.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Whether, O blessed Maruts, ye be dwelling in highest, midmost, or in lowest heaven,
Thence, O ye Rudras, and thou also, Agni, notice the sacrificial food we offer.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Maruts, Lords of all, when Agni and when ye drive downward from sublimest heaven along the heights,
Shakers of all, rejoicing, slayers of the foe, give riches to the Soma-pressing worshipper.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Agni, with the Maruts as they gleam and sing, gathered in troop, rejoicing drink the Soma juice;
With these the living ones who cleanse and further all, joined with thy banner, O Vaiśvānara, from of old.
