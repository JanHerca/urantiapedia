## HYMN CXCI. Water. Grass. Sun.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  VENOMOUS, slightly venomous, or venomous aquatic worm,—
Both creatures, stinging, unobserved, with poison have infected me.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Coming, it kills the unobserved; it kills them as it goes away,
It kills them as it drives them off, and bruising bruises them to death.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Sara grass, Darbha, Kuśara, and Sairya, Muñja, Vīraṇa,
Where all these creatures dwell unseen, with poison have infected me.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The cows had settled in their stalls, the beasts of prey had sought their lairs,
Extinguished were the lights of men, when things unseen infected me.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Or these, these reptiles, are observed, like lurking thieves at evening time.
Seers of all, themselves unseen: be therefore very vigilant.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Heaven is your Sire, your Mother Earth, Soma your Brother, Aditi
Your Sister: seeing all, unseen, keep still and dwell ye happily.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Biters of shoulder or of limb, with needle-stings, most venomous,
Unseen, whatever ye may be, vanish together and be gone.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Slayer of things unseen, the Sun, beheld of all, mounts, eastward, up,
Consuming all that are not seen, and evil spirits of the night.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  There hath the Sun-God mounted up, who scorches much and everything.
Even the Āditya from the hills, all-seen, destroying things unseen.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  I hang the poison in the Sun, a wine-skin in a vintner's house,
He will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  This little bird, so very small, hath swallowed all thy poison up.
She will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The three-times-seven bright sparks of fire have swallowed up the poison's strength.
They will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Of ninety rivers and of nine with power to stay the venom's course,—
The names of all I have secured: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  So have the peahens three-times-seven, so have the maiden Sisters Seven
Carried thy venom far away, as girls bear water in their jars.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The poison-insect is so small; I crush the creature with a stone.
I turn the poison hence away, departed unto distant lands.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Forth issuing from the mountain's side the poison-insect spake and said:
Scorpion, they venom is but weak.
