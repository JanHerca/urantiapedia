## HYMN XLI. Viśvedevas

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHO, Mitra-Varuṇa, is your pious servant to give you gifts from earth or mighty heaven?
Preserve us in the seat of holy Order, and give the offerer power that winneth cattle.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman, and Āyu, Indra Ṛbhukṣan, and the Maruts, love us,
And they who of one mind with bounteous Rudra accept the hymn and laud with adorations.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  You will I call to feed the car-horse, Aśvins, with the wind's flight swiftest of those who travel:
Or also to the Asura of heaven, Worshipful, bring a hymn as ’twere libation.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The heavenly Victor, he whose priest is Kaṇva, Tṛta with Dyaus accordant, Vāta, Agni,
All-feeding Pūṣan, Bhaga sought the oblation, as they whose steeds are fleetest seek the contest.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Bring ye your riches forward borne on horses: let thought be framed for help and gain of treasure.
Blest he the priest of Auśija through courses, the courses which are yours the fleet, O Maruts.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Bring hither him who yokes the car, your Vāyu, who praises with his songs, the God and Singer;
And, praying and devout, noble and prudent, may the Gods’ Spouses in their thoughts retain us.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I speed to you with powers that should be honoured, with songs distinguishing Heaven's mighty Daughters,
Morning and Night, the Two, as ’twere all-knowing: these bring the sacrifice unto the mortal.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  You I extol, the nourishers of heroes bringing you gifts, Vastospati and Tvaṣṭar-
Rich Dhiṣaṇā accords through our obeisance - andTrees and Plants, for the swift gain of riches.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ours be the Parvatas, even they, for offspring, free-moving, who are Heroes like the Vasus.
May holy Āptya, Friend of man, exalted, strengthen our word for ever and be near us.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Tṛta praised him, germ of the earthly hero, with pure songs him the Offspring of the Waters.
Agn; with might neighs loudly like a charger: he of the flaming hair destroys the forests.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  How shall we speak to the great might of Rudra? How speak to Bhaga who takes thought for riches?
May Plants, the Waters, and the Sky preserve us, and Woods and Mountains with their trees for tresses.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  May the swift Wanderer, Lord of refreshments listen to our songs, who speeds throuih cloudy heaven:
And may the Waters, bright like castles, hear us, as they flow onward from the cloven mountain.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  We know your ways, ye Mighty Ones receiving choice meed, ye Wonderful, we will proclaim it.
Even strong birds descend not to the mortal who strives to reach them with swift blow and weapons.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Celestial and terrestrial generations, and Waters will I summon to the feasting.
May days with bright dawns cause my songs to prosper, and may the conquered streams increase their waters.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Duly to each one hath my laud been offered. Strong be Varūtrī with her powers to succour.
May the great Mother Rasā here befriend us, straight-handed, with the princes, striving forward.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  How may we serve the Liberal Ones with worship, the Maruts swift of course in invocation, the Maruts far-renowned in invocation?
Let not the Dragon of the Deep annoy us, and gladly may he welcome our addresses.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Thus thinking, O ye Gods, the mortal wins you to give him increase of his herds of cattle: the mortal wins him, O ye Gods, your favour.
Here he wins wholesome food to feed this body: as for mine old age, Nirrti consume it
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  O Gods, may we obtain from you this favour, strengthening food through the Cow's praise, ye Vasus.
May she who gives good gifts, the gracious Goddes. s, come speeding nigh to us for our well-being.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  May Iḷā, Mother of the herds of cattle, and Urvasi with all the streams accept us;
May Urvasi in lofty heaven accepting, as she partakes the oblation of the living,
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Visit us while she shares Urjavya's food.

<span id="h42"></span>

## HYMN XLII. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now may our sweetest song with deep devotion reach Varuṇa, Mitra, Aditi, and Bhaga.
May the Five Priests' Lord, dwelling in oblations, bliss-giving Asura, hear, whose paths are open.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May Aditi welcome, even as a mother her dear heart-gladdening son, my song that lauds her.
The prayer they love, bliss-giving, God-appointed, I offer unto Varuṇa and Mitra.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In spirit him, the Sagest of the Sages; with sacrificial oil and meath bedew him
So then let him, God Savitar, provide us excellent, ready, and resplendent treasures.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  With willing mind, Indra, vouchsafe us cattle, prosperity, Lord of Bays! and pious patrons;
And, with the sacred prayer by Gods appointed, give us the holy Deities' lovingkindness.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  God Bhaga, Savitar who deals forth riches, Indra, and they who conquer Vṛtra's treasures,
And Vāja and Ṛbhukṣan and Purandhi, the Mighty and Immortal Ones, protect us!
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let us declare his deeds, the undecaying unrivalled Victor whom the Maruts follow.
None of old times, O Maghavan, nor later, none of these days hath reached thy hero prowess.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Praise him the Chief who gives the boon of riches, Bṛhaspati distributor of treasures,
Who, blessing most the man who sings and praises, comes with abundant wealth to his invoker.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Tended, Bṛhaspati, with thy protections, the princes are unharmed and girt by heroes.
Wealth that brings bliss is found among the givers of horses and of cattle and of raiment.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Make their wealth flee who, through our hymns enjoying their riches, yield us not an ample guerdon.
Far from the sun keep those who hate devotion, the godless, prospering in their vocation.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  With wheelless chariots drive down him, O Maruts, who at the feasts of Gods regards the demons.
May he, though bathed in sweat, form empty wishes, who blames his sacred rite who toils to serve you.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Praise him whose bow is strong and sure his arrow, him who is Lord of every balm that bealeth.
Worship thou Rudra for his great good favour: adore the Asura, God, with salutations.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  May the House-friends, the cunning-handed Artists, may the Steer's Wives, the streams carved out by Vibhvan,
And may the fair Ones honour and befriend us, Sarasvatī, Brhaddiva, and Rākā.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  My newest song, thought that now springs within me, I offer to the Great, the Sure Protector,
Who made for us this All, in fond love laying each varied form within his Daughter's bosom.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Now, even now, may thy fair praise, O Singer, attain Idaspati who roars and thunders,
Who, rich in clouds and waters with his lightning speeds forth bedewing both the earth and heaven.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  May this my laud attain the troop of Maruts, those who are youths in act, the Sons of Rudra.
The wish calls me to riches and well-being: praise the unwearied Ones whose steeds are dappled.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  May this my laud reach earth and air's mid-region, and forest trees and plants to win me riches.
May every Deity be swift to listen, and Mother Earth with no ill thought regard me.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Gods, may we dwell in free untroubled bliss.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.
Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy, Immortals!

<span id="h43"></span>

## HYMN XLIII. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY the Milch-cows who hasten to their object come harmless unto us with liquid sweetness.
The Singer, lauding, calls, for ample riches, the Seven Mighty Ones who bring enjoyment.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With reverence and fair praise will I bring hither, for sake of strength, exhaustless Earth and Heaven.
Father and Mother, sweetof speech, fairhanded, may they, far-famed, in every fight protect us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Adhvaryus, make the sweet libations ready, and bring the beautiful bright juice to Vāyu.
God, as our Priest, be thou the first to drink it: we give thee of the mead to make thee joyful.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Two arms-the Soma's dexterous immo. lators-and the ten fingers set and fix the press-stone.
The stalk hath poured, fair with its spreading branches, the mead's bright glittering juice that dwells on mountains.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The Soma hath been pressed for thee, its lover, to give thee power and might and high enjoyment.
Invoked, turn hither in thy car, O Indra, at need, thy two well-trained and dear Bay Horses.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Bring by God-traversed paths, accordant, Agni, the great Aramati, Celestial Lady,
Exalted, worshipped with our gifts and homage, who knoweth holy Law, to drink sweet Soma.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As on his father's lap the son, the darling, so on the fire is set the sacred caldron,
Which holy singers deck, as if extending and heating that which holds the fatty membrane.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Hither, as herald to invite the Aśvins, come the great lofty song, most sweet and pleasant!
Come in one car, joy-givers! to the banquet, like the bolt binding pole and nave, come hither.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I have declared this speech of adoration to mightiest Pūṣan and victorious Vāyu,
Who by their bounty are the hymns' inspirers, and of themselves give power as a possession.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Invoked by us bring hither, jatavedas the Maruts all under their names and figures.
Come to the sacrifice with aid all Maruts, all to the songs and praises of the singer!
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  From high heaven may Sarasvatī the Holy visit our sacrifice, and from the mountain.
Eager, propitious, may the balmy Goddess hear our effectual speech, our invocation.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Set in his seat the God whose back is dusky, Bṛhaspati the lofty, the Disposer.
Him let us worship, set within the dwelling, the red, the golden-hued, the allresplendent.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  May the Sustainer, high in heaven, come hither, the Bounteous One, invoked, with all his favours,
Dweller with Dames divine, with plants, unwearied, the Steer with triple horn, the life-bestower.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  The tuneful eloquent priests of him who liveth have sought the Mother's bright and loftiest station.
As living men, with offered gifts and homage they deck the most auspicious Child to clothe him.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Agni, great vital power is thine, the mighty: pairs waxing old in their devotion seek thee.
May every Deity be swift to listen, and Mother Earth with no ill thought regard me.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Gods, may we dwell in free untroubled bliss.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.
Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy, Immortals!

<span id="h44"></span>

## HYMN XLIV. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  As in the first old times, as all were wont, as now, he draweth forth the power turned hitherward with song,
The Princedom throned on holy grass, who findeth light, swift, conquering in the' plants wherein he waxeth strong.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Shining to him who leaves heaven's regions undisturbed, which to his sheen who is beneath show fair in light,
Good guardian art thou, not to be deceived, Most Wise! Far from deceits thy name dwelleth in holy Law.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Truth waits upon oblation present and to come: naught checks him in his way, this vic tory- bringing Priest:
The Mighty Child who glides along the sacred grass, the undecaying Youth set in the midst of plants.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These come, well-yoked, to you for furtherance in the rite: down come the twinborn strengtheners of Law for him,
With reins easily guided and commanding all. In the deep fall the hide stealeth away their names.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou, moving beauteously in visibly pregnant ones, snatching with trees the branching plant that grasps the juice,
Shinest, true Singer! mid the upholders of the voice. Increase thy Consorts thou, lively at sacrifice.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Like as he is beheld such is he said to be.
They with effectual splendour in the floods have made
Earth yield us room enough and amply wide extent, great might invincible, with store of hero sons.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Sūrya the Sage, as if unwedded, with a Spouse, in battle-loving spirit moveth o’er the foes.
May he, self-excellent, grant us a sheltering home, a house that wards the fierce heat off on every side.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thy name, sung forth by Ṛṣis in these hymns of ours, goes to the loftier One with this swift mover's light.
By skill he wins the boon whereon his heart is set: he who bestirs himself shall bring the thing to pass.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The chief and best of these abideth in the sea, nor doth libation fail wherein it is prolonged.
The heart of him who praiseth trembleth not in fear there where the hymn is found connected with the pure.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For it is he: with though to of Ksatra, Manasa, of Yajata, and Sadhri, and Evavada,
With Avatsara's sweet songs will we strive to win the mightiest strength which even he who knows should gain.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The Hawk is their full source, girth-stretching rapturous drink of Visvavara, of Mayin, and Yajata.
They ever seek a fresh draught so that they may come, know when thy time to halt and drink thy fill is near.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Sadaprna the holy, Tarya, Srutavit, and Bahuvrkta, joined with you, have slain the foes.
He gains his wish in both the worlds and brightly shines-when he adores the host with well-advancing steeds.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The worshipper's defender is Sutambhara, producer and uplifter of all holy thoughts.
The milch-cow brought, sweet-flavoured milk was dealt around. Who speaks the bidding text knows this, not he who sleeps.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The sacred hymns love him who wakes and watches: to him who watches come the Sāma verses.
This Soma saith unto the man who watches, I rest and have my dwelling in thy friendship.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Agni is watchful, and the gcas love him; Agni is watchful, Sāma verses seek him.
Agni is watchful, to him saith this Soma, I rest and have my dwelling in thy friendship.

<span id="h45"></span>

## HYMN XLV. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BARDS of approaching Dawn who know the heavens are come with hymns to throw the mountain open.
The Sun hath risen and oped the stable portals: the doors of men, too, hath the God thrown open.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sūrya hath spread his light as splendour: hither came the Cows' Mother, conscious, from the stable,
To streams that flow with biting waves to deserts; and heaven is stablished like a firm-set pillar.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  This laud hath won the burden of the mountain. To aid the ancient birth of mighty waters
The mountain parted, Heaven performed his office. The worshippers were worn with constant serving.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  With hymns and God-loved words will I invoke you, Indra and Agni, to obtain your favour,
For verily sages, skilled in sacrificing, worship the Maruts and with lauds invite them.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  This day approach us: may our thoughts be holy, far from us let us cast away misfortune.
Let us keep those who hate us at a distance, and haste to meet the man who sacrifices.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Come, let us carry out, O friends, the purpose wherewith the Mother threw the Cow's stall open,
That wherewith Manu conquered Visisipra, wherewith the wandering merchant gained heaven's water.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Here, urged by hands, loudly hath rung the press-stone wherewith Navagvas through ten months sang praises.
Saramā went aright and found the cattle. Aṅgiras gave effect to all their labours.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  When at the dawning of this mighty Goddess, Aṅgirases all sang forth with the cattle,—
Their spring is in the loftiest place of meeting,—Saramā found the kine by Order's pathway.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Borne by his Coursers Seven may Sūrya visit the field that spreadeth wide for his long journey.
Down on the Soma swooped the rapid Falcon. Bright was the young Sage moving mid his cattle.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Sūrya hath mounted to the shining ocean when he hath yoked his fair-backed Tawny Horses.
The wise have drawn him like a ship through water: the floods obedient have descended hither.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  I lay upon the Floods your hymn, lightwinning, wherewith Navagvas their ten months completed.
Through this our hymn may we have Gods to guard us: through this our hymn pass safe beyond affliction.

<span id="h46"></span>

## HYMN XLVI. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WELL knowing I have bound me, horselike, to the pole: I carry that which bears as on and gives us help.
I seek for no release, no turning back therefrom. May he who knows the way, the Leader, guide me straight.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, and Mitra, give, O ye Gods, and Marut host, and Viṣṇu.
May both Nāsatyas, Rudra, heavenly Matrons, Pūṣan, Sarasvatī, Bhaga, accept us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aditi, the Waters, Mountains, Maruts, Sky, and Earth and Heaven,
Viṣṇu I call, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, and Bhaga, Samsa, Savitar that they may help.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May Viṣṇu also and Vāta who injures none, and Soma granter of possessions give us joy;
And may the Ṛbhus and the Aśvins, Tvaṣṭar and Vibhvan remember us so that we may have wealth.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So may the band of Maruts dwelling in the sky, the holy, come to us to sit on sacred grass;
Bṛhaspati and Pūṣan grant us sure defence, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman guard and shelter us.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And may the Mountains famed in noble eulogies, and the fair-gleaming Rivers keep us safe from harm.
May Bhaga the Dispenser come with power and grace, and far-pervading Aditi listen to my call.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May the Gods’ Spouses aid us of their own freewill, aid us to offspring and the winning of the spoil.
Grant us protection, O ye gracious Goddesses, ye who are on the earth or in the waters' realm.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  May the Dames, wives of Gods, enjoy our presents, Rat, Aśvini, Agnāyī, and Indrāṇī.
May Rodasī and Varuṇānī hear us, and Goddesses come at the Matrons' season.

<span id="h47"></span>

## HYMN XLVII. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  URGING to toil and making proclamation, seeking Heaven's Daughter comes the Mighty Mother:
She comes, the youthful Hymn, unto the Fathers, inviting to her home and loudly calling.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Swift in their motion, hasting to their duty, reaching the central point of life immortal,
On every side about the earth and heaven go forth the spacious paths without a limit.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Steer, Sea, Red Bird with strong wings, he hath entered the dwelling-place of the Primeval Father.
A gay-hued Stone set in the midst of heaven, he hath gone forth and guards mid-air's two limits.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Four bear him up and give him rest and quiet, and ten invigorate the Babe for travel.
His kine most excellent, of threefold nature, pass swiftly round the boundaries of heaven.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Wondrous, O people, is the mystic knowledge that while the waters stand the streams are flowing:
That, separate from his Mother, Two support him, closely-united, twins, here made apparent.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For him they lenghten prayers and acts of worship: the Mothers weave garments for him their offspring.
Rejoicing, for the Steer's impregning contact, his Spouses move on paths or heaven to meet him.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Be this our praise, O Varuṇa and Mitra may this be health and force to us, O Agni.
May we obtain firm ground and room for resting: Glory to Heaven, the lofty habitation!

<span id="h48"></span>

## HYMN XLVIII. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHAT may we meditate for the beloved Power, mighty in native strength and glorious in itself,
Which as a magic energy seeking waters spreads even to theimmeasurable middle region's cloud?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O'er all the region with their uniform advance these have spread out the lore that giveth heroes strength.
Back, with their course reversed, the others pass away: the pious lengthens life with those that are before.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With pressing-stones and with the bright beams of the day he hurls his broadest bolt against the Guileful One.
Even he whose hundred wander in his own abode, driving the days afar and bringing them again.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I, to enjoy the beauty of his form, behold that rapid rush of his as ’twere an axe's edge,
What time he gives the man who calls on him in fight wealth like a dwelling-house filled full with store of food.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Four-faced and nobly clad, Varuṇa, urging on the pious to his task, stirs himself with the tongue.
Naught by our human nature do we know of him, him from whom Bhaga Savitar bestows the boon.

<span id="h49"></span>

## HYMN XLIX. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THIS day I bring God Savitar to meet you, and Bhaga who allots the wealth of mortals.
You, Aśvins, Heroes rich in treasures, daily seeking your friendship fain would I turn hither.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Knowing full well the Asura's time of coming, worship God Savitar with hymns and praises.
Let him who rightly knoweth speak with homage to him who dealeth out man's noblest treasure.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Not for reward doth Pūṣan send his blessings, Bhaga, or Aditi: his garb is splendour.
May Indra, Visniu, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni produce auspicious days, the Wonder-Workers.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Sending the shelter which we ask, the foeless Savitar and the Rivers shall approach us.
When I, the sacrifice's priest, invite them, may we he lords of wealth and rich possessions.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  They who devote such worship to the Vasus, singing their hymns to Varuṇa and Mitra,
Vouchsafe them ample room, far off be danger. Through grace of Heaven and Earth may we be happy.

<span id="h50"></span>

## HYMN L. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding God.
Each one solicits him for wealth and seeks renown to prosper him.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  These, leading God, are thine, and these here ready to speak after us.
As such may we attain to wealth and wait with services on thee.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So further honour as our guests the Hero Gods and then the Dames.
May he remove and keep afar our foes and all who block our path.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Where fire is set, and swiftly runs the victim dwelling in the trough,
He wins, with heroes in his home, friendly to man, like constant streams.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May these thy riches, Leader God! that rule the car, be blest to us,
Yea, blest to us for wealth and weal. This will we ponder praising strength, this ponder as we praise the God.
