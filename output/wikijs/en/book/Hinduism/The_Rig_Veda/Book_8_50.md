## HYMN XLI. Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To make this Varuṇa come forth sing thou a song unto the band of Maruts wiser than thyself,—
This Varuṇa who guardeth well the thoughts of men like herds of kine.
Let all the others die away.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Him altogether praise I with the song and hymns our fathers sang, and with Nabhāka's eulogies,—
Him dwelling at the rivers’ source, surrounded by his Sisters Seven.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The nights he hath encompassed, and stablished the morns with magic art visible over all is he.
His dear Ones, following his Law, have prospered the Three Dawns for him.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He, visible o’er all the earth, stablished the quarters of the sky:
He measured out the eastern place, that is the fold of Varuṇa: like a strong herdsman is the God.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He who supports the worlds of life, he who well knows the hidden names mysterious of the morning beams,
He cherishes much wisdom, Sage, as heaven brings forth each varied form.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  In whom all wisdom centres, as the nave is set within the wheel.
Haste ye to honour Trita, as kine haste to gather in the fold, even as they muster steeds to yoke.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He wraps these regions as a robe; he contemplates the tribes of Gods and all the works of mortal men.
Before the home of Varuṇa all the Gods follow his decree.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He is an Ocean far-removed, yet through the heaven to him ascends the worship which these realms possess.
With his bright foot he overthrew their magic, and went up to heaven.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Ruler, whose bright far-seeing rays, pervading all three earths, have filled the three superior realms of heaven.
Firm is the seat of Varuṇa: over the Seven he rules as King.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Who, after his decree, o’erspread the Dark Ones with a robe of light;
Who measured out the ancient seat, who pillared both the worlds apart as the Unborn supported heaven. Let all the others die away.

<span id="h42"></span>

## HYMN XLII Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LORD of all wealth, the Asura propped the heavens, and measured out the broad earth's wide expanses.
He, King supreme, approached all living creatures. All these are Varuṇa's holy operations.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So humbly worship Varuṇa the Mighty revere the wise Guard of World Immortal.
May he vouchsafe us triply-barred protection. O Earth and Heaven, within your lap preserve us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Sharpen this song of him who strives his utmost, sharpen, God Varuṇa, his strength and insight;
May we ascend the ship that bears us safely, whereby we may pass over all misfortune.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Aśvins, with songs the singer stones have made you hasten hitherward,
Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As the sage Atri with his hymns, O Aśvins, called you eagerly,
Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  So have I called you to our aid, even as the wise have called of old,
Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.

<span id="h43"></span>

## HYMN XLIII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THESE songs of mine go forth as lauds of Agni, the disposing Sage,
Whose worshipper is ne’er o’erthrown.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Wise Agni Jātavedas, I beget a song of praise for thee.
Who willingly receivest it.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thy sharpened flames, O Agni, like the gleams of light that glitter through,
Devour the forests with their teeth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Gold-coloured, bannered with the smoke, urged by the wind, aloft to heaven
Rise, lightly borne, the flames of fire.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  These lightly kindled fiery flames are all around made visible,
Even as the gleanings of the Dawns.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  As Jātavedas speeds along, the dust is black beneath his feet,
When Agni spreads upon the earth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Making the plants his nourishment, Agni devours and wearies not,
Seeking the tender shrubs again.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Bending him down with all his tongues, he flickers with his fiery glow
Splendid is Agni in the woods.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Agni, thine home is in the floods: into the plants thou forcest way,
And as their Child art born anew.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Worshipped with offerings shines thy flame, O Agni, from the sacred oil,
With kisses on the ladle's mouth.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Let us serve Agni with our hymns, Disposer, fed on ox and cow,
Who bears the Soma on his back.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Yea, thee, O Agni, do we seek with homage and with fuel, Priest
Whose wisdom is most excellent.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  O worshipped with oblations, pure Agni, we call on thee as erst,
Did Bhṛgu, Manus, Aṅgiras.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For thou, O Agni, by the fire, Sage by the Sage, Good by the Good,
Friend by the Friend, art lighted up.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  So wealth in thousands, food with store of heroes give thou to the sage,
O Agni, to the worshipper.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  O Agni, Brother, made by strength, Lord of red steeds and brilliant sway,
Take pleasure in this laud of mine.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  My praises, Agni, go to thee, as the cows seek the stall to meet,
The lowing calf that longs for milk.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Agni, best Aṅgiras, to thee all people who have pleasant homes,
Apart, have turned as to their wish.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  The sages skilled in holy song and thinkers with their thoughts have urged
Agni to share the sacred feast.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  So, Agni, unto thee the Priest, Invoker, strong in forays, pray
Those who spin out the sacrifice.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  In many a place, the same in look art thou, a Prince o’er all the tribes
In battles we invoke thine aid.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Pray thou to Agni, pray to him who blazes served with sacred oil:
Let him give ear to this our call.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  We call on thee as such, as one who hears, as Jātavedas, one,
Agni! who beats away our foes.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  I pray to Agni, King of men, the Wonderful, the President
Of holy Laws: may he give ear.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Him like a bridegroom, him who stirs all people, like a noble horse,
Like a fleet steed, we instigate.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Slaying things deadly, burning up foes, Rākṣasas, on every side,
Shine, Agni, with thy sharpened flame.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Thou whom the people kindle even as Manus did, best Aṅgiras!
O Agni, mark thou this my speech.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  O Agni, made by strength! be thou born in the heavens or born in floods,
As such we call on thee with songs.
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Yea, all the people, all the folk who have good dwellings, each apart,
Send food for thee to eat thereof.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  O Agni, so may we, devout, gazed at by men, throughout our days,
Pass lightly over all distress.
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  We venerate with cheerful hearts the cheerful Agni, dear to all,
Burning, with purifying flame.
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  So thou, O Agni rich in light, beaming like Sūrya with thy rays
Boldly demolishest the gloom,
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  We pray to thee for this thy gift, Victor the gift that faileth not,
O Agni, choicest wealth from thee.

<span id="h44"></span>

## HYMN XLIV. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  PAY service unto Agni with your fuel, rouse your Guest with oil:
In him present your offerings.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Agni, do thou accept my laud, be magnified by this my song:
Welcome my sweetly-spoken words.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Agni, envoy, I place in front; the oblation-bearer I address:
Here let him seat the Deities.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni, the lofty flames of thee enkindled have gone up on high,
Thy bright flames, thou Refulgent One.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Beloved! let my ladles full of sacred oil come near to thee:
Agni, accept our offerings.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  I worship Agni—may he hear!—the cheerful, the Invoker, Priest,
Of varied splendour, rich in light.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ancient Invoker, meet for praise, beloved Agni, wise and strong,
The visitant of solemn rites.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Agni, best Aṅgiras, accept straightway these offerings, and guide
The seasonable sacrifice.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Excellent God, with brilliant flames, enkindled bring thou hitherward,
Knowing the way, the Heavenly Host.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Him, Sage and Herald, void of guile, ensign of sacrifices, him
Smoke-bannered, rich in light, we seek.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Agni, be our Guardian thou, God, against those who injure us:
Destroy our foes, thou Son of Strength.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Making his body beautiful, Agni the Sage hath waxen by
The singer and his ancient hymn.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  I invocate the Child of Strength, Agni with purifying flame,
At this well-ordered sacrifice.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  So Agni, rich in many friends, with fiery splendour, seat thyself
With Gods upon our sacred grass.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The mortal man who serves the God Agni within his own abode,
For him he causes wealth to shine.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Agni is head and height of heaven, the Master of the earth is he:
He quickeneth the waters’ seed.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Upward, O Agni, rise thy flames, pure and resplendent, blazing high,
Thy lustres, fair effulgences.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For, Agni, thou as Lord of Light rulest o’er choicest gifts: may I,
Thy singer, find defence in thee.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O Agni, they who understand stir thee to action with their thoughts:
So let our songs enhance thy might.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  We ever claim the friendship of Agni, the singing messenger,
Of God-like nature, void of guile.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Agni who bears most holy sway, the holy Singer, holy Sage,
Shines holy when we worship him.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Yea, let my meditations, let my songs exalt thee evermore.
Think, Agni, of our friendly bond,
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  If I were thou and thou wert I, O Agni, every prayer of thine
Should have its due fulfilment here.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  For Excellent and Lord of wealth. art thou O Agni, rich in light:
May we enjoy thy favouring grace.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Agni, to thee whose laws stand fast our resonant songs of praise speed forth,
As rivers hasten to the sea.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Agni, the Youthful Lord of men, who stirreth much and eateth all,
The Sage, I glorify with hymns.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  To Agni let us haste with lauds, the Guide of sacrificial rites,
Armed with sharp teeth, the Mighty One.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And let this man, good Agni, be with thee the singer of thy praise:
Be gracious, Holy One, to him.
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  For thou art sharer of our feast, wise, ever watchful as a Sage:
Agni, thou shinest in the sky.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  O Agni, Sage, before our foes, before misfortunes fall on us,
Excellent Lord, prolong our lives.

## HYMN XLV. Indra

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HITHERWARD! they who light flame and straightway trim the sacred grass.
Whose Friend is Indra ever young.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  High is their fuel, great their laud, wide is their splinter from the stake,
Whose Friend is Indra ever young.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Unequalled in fight the hero leads his army with the warrior chiefs.
Whose Friend is Indra ever young.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The new-born Vṛtra-slayer asked his Mother, as he seized his shaft,
Who are the fierce? Who are renowned?
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Śavasī answered, He who seeks thine enmity will battle like
A stately elephant on a hill.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And hear, O Maghavan; to him who craves of thee thou grantest all
Whate’er thou makest firm is firm.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  What time the Warrior Indra goes to battle, borne by noble steeds,
Best of all charioteers is he.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Repel, O Thunder-armed, in all directions all attacks on us:
And be our own most glorious God.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  May Indra set our car in front, in foremost Place to win the spoil,
He whom the wicked injure not.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Thine enmity may we escape, and, Śakra, for thy bounty, rich
In kine, may we come near to thee
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Softly approaching, Thunder-armed wealthy by hundreds, rich in steeds,
Unrivalled, ready with our gifts.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  For thine exalted excellence gives to thy worshippers each day
Hundreds and thousands of thy boons.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Indra, we know thee breaker-down even of strong forts, winner of spoil,
As one who conquers wealth for us.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Though thou art highest, Sage and Bold! let the drops cheer thee when we come
To thee as to a trafficker.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Bring unto us the treasure of the opulent man who, loth to give,
Hath slighted thee for gain of wealth.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Indra, these friends of ours, supplied with Soma, wait and look to thee,
As men with fodder to the herd.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And thee who art not deaf, whose cars are quick to listen, for our aid,
We call to us from far away.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  When thou hast listened, make our call one which thou never wilt forget,
And be our very nearest Friend.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  When even now, when we have been in trouble, we have thought of thee,
O Indra, give us gifts of kine.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  O Lord of Strength, we rest on thee, as old men rest upon a staff:
We long to have. thee dwell with us.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  To Indra sing a song of praise, Hero of mighty valour, him
Whom no one challenges to war.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Hero, the Soma being shed, I pour the juice for thee to drink:
Sate thee and finish thy carouse.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Let not the fools, or those who mock beguile thee when they seek thine aid
Love not the enemies of prayer.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Here let them with rich milky draught cheer thee to great munificence:
Drink as the wild-bull drinks the lake.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Proclaim in our assemblies what deeds, new and ancient, far away,
The Vṛtra-slayer hath achieved.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  In battle of a thousand arms Indra drank Kadrū's Soma juice:
There he displayed his manly might.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  True undeniable strength he found in Yadu and in Turvaśa,
And conquered through the sacrifice.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Him have I magnified, our Lord in, common, Guardian of your folk,
Discloser of great wealth in kine;
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Ṛbhukṣan, not to be restrained, who strengthened Tugra's son in lauds,
Indra beside the flowing juice;
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Who for Triśoka clave the hill that formed a wide receptacle,
So that the cows might issue forth.
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Whate’er thy plan or purpose be, whate’er, in transport, thou wouldst do,
Do it not, Indra, but be kind.
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  But little hath been heard of done upon the earth by one like thee i
Let thine heart, Indra, turn to us.
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Thine then shall be this high renown, thine shall these lofty praises be,
When, Indra, thou art kind to us.
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Not for one trespass, not for two, O Hero, slay us, nor for three,
Nor yet for many trespasses.
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  I fear one powerful like thee, the crusher-down of enemies,
Mighty, repelling all attacks.
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  O wealthy God, ne’er may I live to see my friend or son in need:
Hitherward let thy heart be turned.
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  What friend, O people, unprovoked, hath ever said unto a friend,
He turns and leaves us in distress?
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  Hero, insatiate enjoy this Soma juice so near to thee,
Even as a hunter rushing down.
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  Hither I draw those Bays of thine yoked
by our hymn, with splendid car,
That thou mayst give unto the priests.
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  Drive all our enemies away, smite down the foes who press around,
And bring the wealth for which we long:
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  O Indra, that which is concealed in strong firm place precipitous:
Bring us the wealth for which we long
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  Great riches which the world of men shall recognize as sent by thee:
Bring us the wealth for which we long.

<span id="h46"></span>

## HYMN XLVI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WE, Indra, Lord of ample wealth, our Guide, depend on one like thee,
Thou driver of the Tawny Steeds.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For, Hurler of the Bolt, we know thee true, the giver of our food,
We know the giver of our wealth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O thou whose majesty the bards celebrate with their songs, thou Lord,
Of hundred powers and hundred aids.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Fair guidance hath the mortal man whom Aryaman, the Marut host,
And Mitra, void of guile, protect.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Kine, steeds, and hero strength he gains, and prospers, by the Ādityas sped,
Ever in wealth which all desire.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  We pray to Indra for his gift, to him the Fearless and the Strong,
We pray to him the Lord of wealth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For verily combined in him are all the fearless powers of aid.
Him, rich in wealth, let swift Steeds bring to us, his Bays, to Soma juice for his carouse:
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Yea, that most excellent carouse, Indra, which slays most enemies,
With Heroes wins the light of heaven, and is invincible in war:
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Which merits fame, all-bountiful! and, unsubdued, hath victory in deeds of might.
So come to our libations, Strongest! Excellent! May we obtain a stall of kine.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Responding to our wish for cows, for steeds, and chariots, as of old,
Be gracious, Greatest of the Great
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For, Hero, nowhere can I find the bounds of thy munificence.
Still do thou favour us, O Bolt-armed Maghavan: with strength hast thou rewarded hymns.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  High, glorifier of his friend, he knows all generations, he whom many praise.
All races of mankind with ladies lifted up invoke that Mighty Indra's aid.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Be he our Champion and Protector in great deeds, rich in all wealth, the Vṛtra-slayer, Maghavan.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  In the wild raptures of the juice sing to your Hero with high laud, to him the Wise,
To Indra, glorious in his name, the Mighty One, even as the hymn alloweth it.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thou givest wealth to me myself, thou givest treasure, Excellent! and the strong steed,
O Much-invoked, in deeds of might, yea, even now.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Him, Sovran Ruler of all precious things, who even hath power o’er this fair form of his,
As now it taketh shape, and afterward,
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  We praise, so that the Mighty One may speed to you, Pourer of bounties, Traveller, prepared to go.
Thou favourest the Maruts known to all, by song and sacrifice.
With song and praise I sing to thee.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  We in the sacrifice perform their will whose voice is lifted high,
The worship of those Thundering Ones who o’er the ridges of these mountains fly in troops.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O Indra, Mightiest, bring us that which crushes men of evil minds,
Wealth suited to our needs, O Stirrer of the thought, best wealth, O thou who stirrest thought.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  O Winner, noble winner, strong, wondrous, most splendid, excellent,
Sole Lord of victory, bring all-overpowering wealth, joy-giving, chief in deeds of might.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Now let the godless man approach who hath received reward so great
As Vaśa, Aśvya, when this light of morning dawned, received from Pṛthuśravas, from Kanīta's son.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Steeds sixty thousand and ten thousand kine, and twenty hundred camels I obtained;
Ten hundred brown in hue, and other ten red in three spots: in all, ten thousand kine.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Ten browns that make my wealth increase, fleet steeds whose tails are long and fair,
Turn with swift whirl my chariot wheel;
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  The gifts which Pṛthuśravas gave, Kanīta's son munificent.
He gave a chariot wrought of gold: the prince was passing bountiful, and won himself most lofty fame.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Come thou to this great rite of ours, Vāyu! to give us vigorous light.
We have served thee that thou mightest give much to us, yea, mightest quickly give great wealth.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Who with thrice seven times seventy horses comes to us, invested with the rays of morn,
Through these our Soma-draughts and those who press, to give, drinker of pure bright Soma Juice.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Who hath inclined this glorious one, bounteous himself, to give me gifts.
Borne on firm chariot with the prosperous Nahuṣa, wise, to a man yet more devout.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Sole Lord in beauty meet for praise, O Vāyu, dropping fatness down,
Hurried along by steeds, by camels, and by hounds, spreads forth thy train: even this it is.
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  So, as a prize dear to the strong, the sixty thousand have I gained,
Bulls that resemble vigorous steeds.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  To me come oxen like a herd, yea, unto me the oxen come.
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And in the grazing herd he made a hundred camels bleat for me,
And twenty hundred mid the white.
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  A hundred has the sage received, Dāsa Balbūtha's and Tarukṣa's gifts.
These are thy people, Vāyu, who rejoice with Indra for their guard, rejoice with Gods for guards.
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And now to Vaśa Aśvya here this stately woman is led forth,
Adorned with ornaments of gold.

## HYMN XLVII. Ādityas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  GREAT help ye give the worshipper, Varuṇa, Mitra, Mighty Ones! No sorrow ever reaches him whom ye, Ādityas, keep from harm. Yours are incomparable aids, and good the succour they afford.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Gods, Ādityas, well ye know the way to keep all woes afar.
As the birds spread their sheltering wings, spread your protection over us.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As the birds spread their sheltering wings let your protection cover us.
We mean all shelter and defence, ye who have all things for your own.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To whomsoever they, Most Wise, have given a home and means of life,
O'er the whole riches of this man they, the Ādityas, have control.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As drivers of the car avoid ill roads, let sorrows pass us by.
May we be under Indra's guard, in the Ādityas’ favouring grace.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For verily men sink and faint through loss of wealth which ye have given.
Much hath he gained from you, O Gods, whom ye, Ādityas, have approached.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  On him shall no fierce anger fall, no sore distress shall visit him,
To whom, Ādityas, ye have lent your shelter that extendeth far.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Resting in you, O Gods, we are like men who fight in coats of mail.
Ye guard us from each great offence, ye guard us from each lighter fault.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  May Aditi defend us, may Aditi guard and shelter us,
Mother of wealthy Mitra and of Aryaman and Varuṇa.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The shelter, Gods, that is secure, auspicious, free from malady,
A sure protection, triply strong, even that do ye extend to us.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Look down on us, Ādityas, as a guide exploring from the bank.
Lead us to pleasant ways as men lead horses to an easy ford.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Ill be it for the demons' friend to find us or come near to us.
But for the milch-cow be it well, and for the man who strives for fame.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Each evil deed made manifest, and that which is concealed, O Gods,
The whole thereof remove from us to Trita Āptya far away.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Daughter of Heaven, the dream that bodes evil to us or to our kine,
Remove, O Lady of the Light, to Trita Āptya far away.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Even if, O Child of Heaven, it make a garland or a chain of gold,
The whole bad dream, whate’er it be, to Trita Āptya we consign.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  To him whose food and work is this, who comes to take his share therein,
To Trita, and to Dvita, Dawn! bear thou the evil dream away.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  As we collect the utmost debt, even the eighth and sixteenth part,
So unto Āptya we transfer together all the evil dream.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Now have we conquered and obtained, and from our trespasses are free.
Shine thou away the evil dream, O Dawn, whereof we are afraid. Yours are incomparable aids, and good the succour they afford.

## HYMN XLVIII. Soma.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WISELY have I enjoyed the savoury viand, religious-thoughted, best to find out treasure,
The food to which all Deities and mortals, calling it meath, gather themselves together.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Tlou shalt be Aditi as thou hast entered within, appeaser of celestial anger.
Indu, enjoying Indra's friendship, bring us—as a swift steed the car—forward to riches.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We have drunk Soma and become immortal; we have attained the light, the Gods discovered.
Now what may foeman's malice do to harm us? What, O Immortal, mortal man's deception?
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Absorbed into the heart, be sweet, O Indu, as a kind father to his son, O Soma,
As a wise Friend to friend: do thou, wide-ruler, O Soma, lengthen out our days for living.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  These glorious drops that give me freedom have I drunk. Closely they knit my joints as straps secure a car.
Let them protect my foot from slipping on the way: yea, let the drops I drink preserve me from disease.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Make me shine bright like fire produced by friction: give us a clearer sight and make us better.
For in carouse I think of thee, O Soma, Shall I, as a rich man, attain to comfort?
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May we enjoy with an enlivened spirit the juice thou givest, like ancestral riches.
O Soma, King, prolong thou our existence as Sūrya makes the shining days grow longer.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  King Soma, favour us and make us prosper: we are thy devotees; of this be mindful.
Spirit and power are fresh in us, O Indu give us not up unto our foeman's pleasure.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For thou hast settled in each joint, O Soma, aim of men's eyes and guardian of our bodies.
When we offend against thine holy statutes, as a kind Friend, God, best of all, be gracious.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May I be with the Friend whose heart is tender, who, Lord of Bays! when quaffed will never harm me-
This Soma now deposited within me. For this, I pray for longer life to Indra.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Our maladies have lost their strength and vanished: they feared, and passed away into the darkness.
Soma hath risen in us, exceeding mighty, and we are come where men prolong existence.
12, Fathers, that Indu which our hearts have drunken, Immortal in himself, hath entered mortals.
So let us serve this Soma with oblation, and rest securely in his grace and favour.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Associate with the Fathers thou, O Soma, hast spread thyself abroad through earth and heaven.
So with oblation let us serve thee, Indu, and so let us become the lords of riches,
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Give us your blessing, O ye Gods’ preservers. Never may sleep or idle talk control us.
But evermore may we, as friends of Soma, speak to the synod with brave sons around us.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  On all sides,. Soma, thou art our life-giver: aim of all eyes, light-finder, come within us.
Indu, of one accord with thy protections both from behind and from before preserve us.

<span id="h49"></span>

## HYMN XLIX. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AGNI, come hither with thy fires; we choose thee as Invoking Priest.
Let the extended ladle full of oil balm thee, best Priest, to sit on sacred grass.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For unto thee, O Aṅgiras, O Son of Strength, move ladles in the sacrifice.
To Agni, Child of Force, whose locks drop oil, we seek, foremost in sacrificial rites.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Agni, thou art Disposer, Sage, Herald, bright God! and worshipful,
Best offerer, cheerful, to be praised in holy rites, pure Lord! by singers with their hymns.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Most Youthful and Eternal, bring the longing Gods to me, the guileless, for the feast.
Come, Vasu, to the banquet that is well-prepared: rejoice thee, gracious, with our songs.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Famed art thou, Agni, far and wide, Preserver, righteous, and a Sage.
The holy singers, O refulgent kindled God! arrangers, call on thee to come.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Shine, Most Resplendent! blaze, send bliss unto the folk, and to thy worshipper
Great art thou.
So may my princes, with good fires, subduing foes, rest in the keeping of the Gods.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Agni, as thou burnest down to earth even high-grown underwood,
So, bright as Mitra is, burn him who injures us, him who plots ill against thy friend.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Give us not as a prey to mortal enemy, nor to the wicked friend of fiends.
With conquering guards, auspicious, unassailable, protect us, O Most Youthful God.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Protect us, Agni, through the first, protect us through the second hymn,
Protect us through three hymns, O Lord of Power and Might, through four hymns, Vasu, guard thou us.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Preserve us from each fiend who brings the Gods no gift, preserve thou us in deeds of strength:
For we possess in thee the nearest Friend of all, for service of the Gods and weal.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  O Holy Agni, give us wealth renowned with men and strengthening life.
Bestow on us, O Helper, that which many crave, more glorious still by righteousness;
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Wherewith we may o’ercome our rivals in the war, o’erpowering the foe's designs.
So wax thou by our food, O Excellent in strength. Quicken our thoughts that find out wealth.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Agni is even as a bull who whets and brandishes his horns.
Well-sharpened are his jaws which may not be withstood: the Child of Strength hath powerful teeth.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Not to be stayed, O Bull, O Agni, are thy teeth when thou art spreading far and wide.
Make our oblations duly offered up, O Priest, and give us store of precious things.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Thou liest in the wood: from both thy Mothers mortals kindle thee.
Unweariedly thou bearest up the offerer's gifts, then shinest bright among the Gods.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And so the seven priests, O Agni, worship thee, Free-giver, Everlasting One.
Thou cleavest through the rock with heat and fervent glow. Agni, rise up above the men.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  For you let us whose grass is trimmed call Agni, Agni, restless God.
Let us whose food is offered call to all the tribes Agni the Invoking Priest of men.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Agni, with noble psalm that tells his wish he dwells, thinking on thee who guardest him.
Speedily bring us strength of many varied sorts to be most near to succour us.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Agni, Praise-singer! Lord of men, God burner-up of Rākṣasas,
Mighty art thou, the ever-present Household-Lord, Home-friend and Guardian from the sky.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Let no fiend come among us, O thou rich in light, no spell of those who deal in spells.
To distant pastures drive faint hunger: far away, O Agni, chase the demons’ friends.

<span id="h50"></span>

## HYMN L. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  BOTH boons,—may Indra, hitherward turned, listen to this prayer of ours,
And mightiest Maghavan with thought inclined to us come near to drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For him, strong, independent Ruler, Heaven and Earth have fashioned forth for power and might.
Thou seatest thee as first among thy peers in place, for thy soul longs for Soma juice.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Fill thyself full, O Lord of wealth, O Indra, with the juice we shed.
We know thee, Lord of Bay Steeds victor in the fight, vanquishing e’en the invincible.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Changeless in truth, O Maghavan Indra, let it be as thou in wisdom willest it.
May we, O fair of check, win booty with thine aid, O Thunderer, swiftly seeking it.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Indra, with all thy saving helps give us assistance, Lord of power.
For after thee we follow even as glorious bliss, thee, Hero, finder-out of wealth.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Increaser of our steeds and multiplying kine, a golden well, O God, art thou,
For no one may impair the gifts laid up in thee. Bring me whatever thing I ask.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For thou,—come to the worshipper!—wilt find great wealth to make us rich.
Fill thyself full, O Maghavan, for gain of kine, full, Indra, for the gain of steeds.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou as thy gift bestowest many hundred herds, yea, many thousands dost thou give.
With singers' hymns have we brought the Fort-render near, singing to Indra for his grace.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Whether the simple or the sage, Indra, have offered praise to thee,
He Śatakratu! by his love hath gladdened thee, ambitious! ever pressing on!
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  If he the Strong of arm, the breaker-down of forts, the great Destroyer, hear my call,
We, seeking riches cry to Indra, Lord of wealth, to Śatakratu with our lauds.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  We count not then as sinners, nor as niggardly or foolish men,
When with the Soma juice which we have shed we make Indra, the Mighty One, our Friend.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Him have we yoked in fight, the powerful Conqueror, debt-claimer, not to be deceived.
Best charioteer, the Victor marks each fault, he knows the strong to whom he will come near.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Indra, give us security from that whereof we are afraid.
Help us, O Maghavan, let thy succour give us this: drive away foes and enemies.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For thou, O liberal Lord of bounty, strengthenest his ample home who worships thee.
So Indra, Maghavan, thou Lover of the Song, we with pressed Soma call on thee,
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Indra is Vṛtra-slayer, guard, our best defender from the foe.
May he preserve our last and middlemost, and keep watch from behind us and before.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Defend us from behind, below, above, in front, on all sides, Indra, shield us well.
Keep far away from us the terror sent from heaven: keep impious weapons far away.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Protect us, Indra, each to-day, each morrow, and each following day.
Our singers, through all days, shalt thou, Lord of the brave, keep safely both by day and night.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  A crushing Warrior, passing rich is Maghavan, endowed with all heroic might.
Thine arms, O Śatakratu, are exceeding strong, arms which have grasped the thunderbolt.
