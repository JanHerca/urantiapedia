## HYMN LXXXI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE men have lifted Indra up, the Vṛtra slayer, to joy and strength:
Him, verily, we invocate in battles whether great or small: be he our aid in deeds of might.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou, Hero, art a warrior, thou art giver of abundant spoil.
Strengthening e’en the feeble, thou aidest the sacrificer, thou givest the offerer ample wealth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When war and battles are on foot, booty is laid before the bold.
Yoke thou thy wildly-rushing Bays. Whom wilt thou slay and whom enrich? Do thou, O Indra, make us rich.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Mighty through wisdom, as he lists, terrible, he hath waxed in strength.
Lord of Bay Steeds, strong-jawed, sublime, he in joined hands for glory's sake hath grasped his iron thunderbolt.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  He filled the earthly atmosphere and pressed against the lights in heaven.
None like thee ever hath been born, none, Indra, will be born like thee. Thou hast waxed mighty over all.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  May he who to the offerer gives the foeman's man-sustaining food,
May Indra lend his aid to us. Deal forth—abundant is thy wealth—that in thy bounty I may share.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He, righteous-hearted, at each time of rapture gives us herds of kine.
Gather in both thy hands for us treasures of many hundred sorts. Sharpen thou us, and bring us wealth.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Refresh thee, Hero, with the juice outpoured for bounty and for strength.
We know thee Lord of ample store, to thee have sent our hearts' desires: be therefore our Protector thou.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  These people, Indra, keep for thee all that is worthy of thy choice.
Discover thou, as Lord, the wealth of men who offer up no gifts: bring thou to us this wealth of theirs.

<span id="h82"></span>

## HYMN LXXXII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  GRACIOUSLY listen to our songs, Maghavan, be not negligent.
As thou hast made us full of joy and lettest us solicit thee, now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Well have they eaten and rejoiced; the friends have risen and passed away.
The sages luminous in themselves have. praised thee with their latest hymn. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Maghavan, we will reverence thee who art so fair to look upon.
Thus praised, according to our wish come now with richly laden car. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He will in very truth ascend the powerful car that finds the kine,
Who thinks upon the well-filled bowl, the Tawny Coursers' harnesser. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let, Lord of Hundred Powers, thy Steeds be harnessed on the right and left.
Therewith in rapture of the juice, draw near to thy beloved Spouse. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  With holy prayer I yoke thy long-maned pair of Bays: come hitherward; thou holdest them in both thy hands.
The stirring draughts of juice outpoured have made thee glad: thou, Thunderer, hast rejoiced with Pūṣan and thy Spouse.

<span id="h83"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDRA, the mortal man well guarded by thine aid goes foremost in the wealth of horses and of kine.
With amplest wealth thou fillest him, as round about the waters clearly seen afar fill Sindhu full.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The heavenly Waters come not nigh the priestly bowl: they but look down and see how far mid-air is spread:
The Deities conduct the pious man to them: like suitors they delight in him who loveth prayer.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Praiseworthy blessing hast thou laid upon the pair who with uplifted ladle serve thee, man and wife.
Unchecked he dwells and prospers in thy law: thy power brings blessing to the sacrificer pouring gifts.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  First the Aṅgirases won themselves vital power, whose fires were kindled through good deeds and sacrifice.
The men together found the Paṇi's hoarded wealth, the cattle, and the wealth in horses and in kine.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Atharvan first by sacrifices laid the paths then, guardian of the Law, sprang up the loving Sun.
Uśanā Kāvya straightway hither drove the kine. Let us with offerings honour Yama's deathless birth.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When sacred grass is trimmed to aid the auspicious work, or the hymn makes its voice of praise sound to the sky.
Where the stone rings as ’twere a singer skilled in laud,—Indra in truth delights when these come near to him.

<span id="h84"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The Soma hath been pressed for thee, O Indra; mightiest, bold One, come.
May Indra-vigour fill thee full, as the Sun fills mid-air with rays.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  His pair of Tawny Coursers bring Indra of unresisted might
Hither to Ṛṣis’ songs of praise and sacrifice performed by men.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Slayer of Vṛtra, mount thy car; thy Bay Steeds have been yoked by prayer.
May, with its voice, the pressing-stone draw thine attention hitherward.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  This poured libation, Indra, drink, immortal, gladdening, excellent.
Streams of the bright have flowed to thee here at the seat of holy Law.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Sing glory now to Indra, say to him your solemn eulogies.
The drops poured forth have made him glad: pay reverence to his might supreme.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When, Indra, thou dost yoke thy Steeds, there is no better charioteer:
None hath surpassed thee in thy might, none with good steeds o’ertaken thee.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  He who alone bestoweth on mortal man who offereth gifts,
The ruler of resistless power, is Indra, sure.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  When will he trample, like a weed, the man who hath no gift for him?
When, verily, will Indra hear our songs of praise?
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He who with Soma juice prepared amid the many honours thee,—
Verily Indra gains thereby tremendous might.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The juice of Soma thus diffused, sweet to the taste, the bright cows drink,
Who for the sake of splendour close to mighty Indra's side rejoice, good in their own supremacy.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Craving his touch the dappled kine mingle the Soma with their milk.
The milch-kine dear to Indra send forth his death-dealing thunderbolt, good in their own supremacy.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  With veneration, passing wise, honouring his victorious might,
They follow close his many laws to win them due preeminence, good in their
own supremacy.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  With bones of Dadhyach for his arms, Indra, resistless in attack,
Struck nine-and-ninety Vṛtras dead.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He, searching for the horse's head, removed among the mountains, found
At Śaryaṇāvān what he sought.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then verily they recognized the essential form of Tvaṣṭar's Bull,
Here in the mansion of the Moon.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Who yokes to-day unto the pole of Order the strong and passionate steers of checkless spirit,
With shaft-armed mouths, heart-piercing, health-bestowing?
Long shall he live who richly pays their service.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Who fleeth forth? who suffereth? who feareth? Who knoweth Indra present, Indra near us?
Who sendeth benediction on his offspring, his household, wealth and person, and the People?
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Who with poured oil and offering honours Agni, with ladle worships at appointed seasons?
To whom to the Gods bring oblation quickly? What offerer, God-favoured, knows him thoroughly?
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Thou as a God, O Mightiest, verily blessest mortal man.
O Maghavan, there is no comforter but thou: Indra, I speak my words to thee.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Let not thy bounteous gifts, let not thy saving help fail us, good Lord, at any time;
And measure out to us, thou lover of mankind, all riches hitherward from men.

<span id="h85"></span>

## HYMN LXXXV. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THEY who are glancing forth, like women, on their way, doers of mighty deeds, swift racers, Rudra's Sons,
The Maruts have made heaven and earth increase and grow: in sacrifices they delight, the strong and wild.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Grown to their perfect strength greatness have they attained; the Rudras have established their abode in heaven.
Singing their song of praise and generating might, they have put glory on, the Sons whom Pṛśni bare.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  When, Children of the Cow, they shine in bright attire, and on their fair limbs lay their golden ornaments,
They drive away each adversary from their path, and, following their traces, fatness floweth down,
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When, mighty Warriors, ye who glitter with your spears, o’erthrowing with your strength e’en what is ne’er o’erthrown,
When, O ye Maruts, ye the host that send the rain, had harnessed to your cars the thought-fleet spotted deer.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When ye have harnessed to your cars the spotted deer, urging the thunderbolt, O Maruts, to the fray,
Forth rush the torrents of the dark red stormy cloud, and moisten, like a skin, the earth with water-floods.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let your swift-gliding coursers bear you hitherward with their fleet pinions. Come ye forward with your arms.
Sit on the grass; a wide seat hath been made for you: delight yourselves, O Maruts, in the pleasant food.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Strong in their native strength to greatness have they grown, stepped to the firmament and made their dwelling wide.
When Viṣṇu saved the Soma bringing wild delight, the Maruts sate like birds on their dear holy grass.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  In sooth like heroes fain for fight they rush about, like combatants fame-seeking have they striven in war.
Before the Maruts every creature is afraid: the men are like to Kings, terrible to behold.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  When Tvaṣṭar deft of hand had turned the thunderbolt, golden, with thousand edges, fashioned more skilfully,
Indra received it to perform heroic deeds. Vṛtra he slew, and forced the flood of water forth.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They with their vigorous strength pushed the well up on high, and clove the cloud in twain though it was passing strong.
The Maruts, bounteous Givers, sending forth their voice, in the wild joy of Soma wrought their glorious deeds.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They drave the cloud transverse directed hitherward, and poured the fountain forth for thirsting Gotama.
Shining with varied light they come to him with help: they with their might fulfilled the longing of the sage.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  The shelters which ye have for him who lauds you, bestow them threefold on the man who offers.
Extend the same boons unto us, ye Maruts. Give us, O Heroes, wealth with noble offspring.

<span id="h86"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVI. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE best of guardians hath that man within whose dwelling place ye drink,
O Maruts, giants of the sky.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Honoured with sacrifice or with the worship of the sages’ hymns,
O Maruts, listen to the call.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yea, the strong man to whom ye have vouchsafed to give a sage, shall move
Into a stable rich in kine.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Upon this hero's sacred grass Soma is poured in daily rites:
Praise and delight are sung aloud.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Let the strong Maruts hear him, him surpassing all men: strength be his
That reaches even to the Sun.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For, through the swift Gods’ loving help, in many an autumn, Maruts, we
Have offered up our sacrifice.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Fortunate shall that mortal be, O Maruts most adorable,
Whose offerings ye bear away.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Heroes truly strong, ye know the toil of him who sings your praise,
The heart's desire of him who loves.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O ye of true strength, make this thing manifest by your greatness: strike
The demon with your thunderbolt.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Conceal the horrid darkness, drive far from us each devouring fiend.
Create the light for which we long.

<span id="h87"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVII. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LOUD Singers, never humbled, active, full of strength, immovable, impetuous, manliest, best-beloved,
They have displayed themselves with glittering ornaments, a few in number only, like the heavens with stars.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When, Maruts, on the steeps ye pile the moving cloud, ye are like birds on whatsoever path it be.
Clouds everywhere shed forth the rain upon your cars. Drop fatness, honey-hued, for him who sings your praise.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Earth at their racings trembles as if weak and worn, when on their ways they yoke their cars for victory.
They, sportive, loudly roaring, armed with glittering spears, shakers of all, themselves admire their mightiness.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Self-moving is that youthful band, with spotted steeds; thus it hath lordly sway, endued with power and might.
Truthful art thou, and blameless, searcher out of sin: so thou, Strong Host, wilt be protector of this prayer.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  We speak by our descent from our primeval Sire; our tongue, when we behold the Soma, stirs itself.
When, shouting, they had joined Indra in toil of fight, then only they obtained their sacrificial names.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Splendours they gained for glory, they who wear bright rings; rays they obtained, and men to celebrate their praise.
Armed with their swords, impetuous and fearing naught, they have possessed the Maruts’ own beloved home.

<span id="h88"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVIII. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  COME hither, Maruts, on your lightning laden cars, sounding with sweet songs, armed with lances, winged with steeds.
Fly unto us with noblest food, like birds, O ye of mighty power.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  With their red-hued or, haply, tawny coursers which speed their chariots on, they come for glory.
Brilliant like gold is he who holds the thunder. Earth have they smitten with the chariot's felly.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For beauty ye have swords upon your bodies. As they stir woods so may they stir our spirits.
For your sake, O ye Maruts very mighty and well-born, have they set the stone, in motion.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The days went round you and came back O yearners, back, to this prayer and to this solemn worship.
The Gotamas making their prayer with singing have pushed the well's lid up to drink the water.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  No hymn way ever known like this aforetime which Gotama sang forth for you, O Maruts,
What time upon your golden wheels he saw you, wild boars rushing about with tusks of iron.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  To you this freshening draught of Soma rusheth, O Maruts, like the voice of one who prayeth.
It rusheth freely from our hands as these libations wont to flow.

<span id="h89"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIX. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY powers auspicious come to us from every side, never deceived, unhindered, and victorious,
That the Gods ever may be with us for our gain, our guardians day by day unceasing in their care.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May the auspicious favour of the Gods be ours, on us descend the bounty of the righteous Gods.
The friendship of the Gods have we devoutly sought: so may the Gods extend our life that we may live.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We call them hither with a hymn of olden time, Bhaga, the friendly Dakṣa, Mitra, Aditi,
Aryaman, Varuṇa, Soma, the Aśvins. May Sarasvatī, auspicious, grant felicity.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May the Wind waft to us that pleasant medicine, may Earth our Mother give it, and our Father Heaven,
And the joy-giving stones that press the Soma's juice. Aśvins, may ye, for whom our spirits long, hear this.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Him we invoke for aid who reigns supreme, the Lord of all that stands or moves, inspirer of the soul,
That Pūṣan may promote the increase of our wealth, our keeper and our guard infallible for our good.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Illustrious far and wide, may Indra prosper us: may Pūṣan prosper us, the Master of all wealth.
May Tārkṣya with uninjured fellies prosper us: Bṛhaspati vouchsafe to us prosperity.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  The Maruts, Sons of Pṛśni, borne by spotted steeds, moving in glory, oft visiting holy rites,
Sages whose tongue is Agni, brilliant as the Sun,—hither let all the Gods for our protection come.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Gods, may we with our ears listen to what is good, and with our eyes see what is good, ye Holy Ones.
With limbs and bodies firm may we extolling you attain the term of life appointed by the Gods.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A hundred autumns stand before us, O ye Gods, within whose space ye bring our bodies to decay;
Within whose space our sons become fathers in turn. Break ye not in the midst our course of fleeting life.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Aditi is the heaven, Aditi is mid-air, Aditi is the Mother and the Sire and Son.
Aditi is all Gods, Aditi five-classed men, Aditi all that hath been born and shall be born.

<span id="h90"></span>

## HYMN XC. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY Varuṇa with guidance straight, and Mitra lead us, he who knows,
And Aryaman in accord with Gods.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For they are dealers forth of wealth, and, not deluded, with their might
Guard evermore the holy laws.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Shelter may they vouchsafe to us, Immortal Gods to mortal men,
Chasing our enemies away.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May they mark out our paths to bliss, Indra, the Maruts, Pūṣan,
and Bhaga, the Gods to be adored.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Yea, Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, ye who run your course, enrich our hymns with kine;
Bless us with all prosperity.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The winds waft sweets, the rivers pour sweets for the man who keeps the Law
So may the plants be sweet for us.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Sweet be the night and sweet the dawns, sweet the terrestrial atmosphere;
Sweet be our Father Heaven to us.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  May the tall tree be full of sweets for us, and full of sweets the Sun:
May our milch-kine be sweet for us.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Be Mitra gracious unto us, and Varuṇa and Aryaman:
Indra, Bṛhaspati be kind, and Viṣṇu of the mighty stride.
