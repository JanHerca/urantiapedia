## HYMN LXXXI. Indra

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INVITE ye Indra with a song to drink your draught of Soma juice,
All-conquering Śatakratu, most munificent of all who live.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Lauded by many, much-invoked, leader of song, renowned of old:
His name is Indra, tell it forth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Indra the Dancer be to us the giver of abundant strength:
May he, the mighty, bring it near.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra whose jaws are strong hath drunk of worshipping Sudaksa's draught,
The Soma juice with barley mixt.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Call Indra loudly with your songs of praise to drink the Soma juice.
For this is what augments his stiength.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When he hath drqnk its gladdening drops, the God with vigour of a God
Hath far surpassed all things that are.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou speedest down to succour us this ever-conquering God of yours,
Him who is drawn to all our songs
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The Warrior not to he restrained, the Soma-drinker ne’er o’erthrown,
The Chieftain of resistless might.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Indra, send us riches, thou Omniscient, worthy of our praise:
Help us in the decisive fray.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Even thence, O Indra, come to us with food that gives a hundred powers,
With food that gives a thousand powers.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  We sought the wisdom of the wise. Śakra, Kine-giver, Thunder-armed!
May we with steeds o’ercome in fight.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  We make thee, Śatakratu, find enjoyment in the songs we sing.
Like cattle in the pasture lands.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  For, Śatakratu, Thunder-armed, all that we craved, as men are wont,
All that we hoped, have we attained.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Those, Son of Strength, are come to thee who cherish wishes in their hearts
O Indra, none excelleth thee.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  So, Hero, guard us with thy care, with thy most liberal providence,
Speedy, and terrible to foes.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  O Śatakratu Indra, now rejoice with that carouse of thine
Which is most splendid of them all
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Even, Indra, that carouse which slays the Vṛtras best, most widely famed,
Best giver of thy power and might.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  For that which is thy gift we know, true Soma-drinker, Thunder-armed,
Mighty One, amid all the folk.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For Indra, Lover of Carouse, loud be our songs about the juice:
Let poets sing the song of praise.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  We summon Indra to the draught, irl whom all glories rest, in whom
The seven communities rejoice.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  At the Trikadrukas the Gods span sacrifice that stirs the mind:
Let our songs aid and prosper it.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Let the drops pass within thee as the rivers flow into the sea:
O fndra, naught excelleth thee.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Thou, wakeful Hero, by thy might hast taken food of Soma juice,
Which, Indra, is within thee now.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  O Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, let Soma be ready for thy maw,
The drops be ready for thy forms.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Now Srutakaksa sings his song that cattle and the steed may come,
That Indra's very self may come.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Here, Indra, thou art ready by our Soma juices shed for thee,
Śakra, at hand that thou mayst give.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Even from far away our songs reach thee, O Caster of the Stone:
May we come very close to thee.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  For so thou art the hero's Friend, a Hero, too, art thou, and strong:
So may thine heart be won to us.
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  So hath the offering, wealthiest Lord, been paid by all the worshippers:
So dwell thou, Indra, even with me.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Be not thou like a slothfid priest, O Lord of spoil and wealth: rejoice
In the pressed Soma blent with milk.
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  O Indra, let not ill designs surround us in the sunbeams' light:
This may we gain with thee for Friend.
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  With thee to help us, Indra, let us answer all our enemies:
For thou art ours and we are thine.
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Indra, the poets and thy friends, faithful to thee, shall loudly sing
Thy praises as they follow thee.

## HYMN LXXXII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SURYA, thou mountest up to meet the Hero famous for his wealth,
Who hurls the bolt and works for man
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Him who with might of both his arms brake nine-and-ninety castles down,
Slew Vṛtra and smote Ahi dead.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  This Indra is our gracious Friend. He sends us in a full broad stream
Riches in horses, kine, and corn.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whatever, Vṛtra-slayer! thou, Sūrya, hast risen upon to-day,
Tbat, Indra, all is in thy power.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When, Mighty One, Lord of the brave, thou thinkest thus, I shall not die,
That thought of thine is true indeed.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou, Indra, goest unto all Soma libations shed for thee,
Both far away and near at hand.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  We make this Indra very strong to strike the mighty Vṛtra dead:
A vigorous Hero shall he be.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Indra was made for giving, set, most mighty, o’er the joyous draught.
Bright, meet for Soma, famed in song.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  By song as ’twere, the powerful bolt which none may parry was prepared
Lofty, invincible he grew.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Indra, Song-lover, lauded, make even in the wilds fair ways for us,
Whenever, Maghavan, thou wilt.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou whose commandment and behest of sovran sway none disregards,
Neither audacious man nor God.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And both these Goddesses, Earth, Heaven, Lord of the beauteous helm! revere
Thy might which no one may resist.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thou in the black cows and the red and in the cows with spotted skin
This white milk hast deposited.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  When in their terror all the Gods shrank from the Dragon's furious might,
Fear of the monster fell on them.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then he was my Defender, then, Invincible, whose foe is not,
The Vṛtra-slayer showed his might.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Him your best Vṛtra-slayer, him the famous Champion of mankind
I urge to great munificence,
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  To come, Much-lauded! Many-named with this same thought that longs for milk,
Whene’er the Soma juice is shed.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Much-honoured by libations, may the Vṛtra-slayer wake for us:
May Śakra listen to our prayers.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  O Hero, with that aid dost thou delight us, with what succour bring
Riches to those who worship thee?
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  With whose libation joys the Strong, the Hero with his team who quells
The foe, to drink the Soma juice?
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Rejoicing in thy spirit bring thousandfold opulence to us:
Enrich thy votary with gifts.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  These juices with their wedded wives flow to enjoyment lovingly:
To waters speeds the restless one.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Presented strengthening gifts have sent Indra away at sacrifice,
With might, onto the cleansing bath.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  These two who share his feast, Bay Steeds with golden manes, shall bring him to
The banquet that is laid for him.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  For thee, O Lord of Light, are shed these Soma-drops, and grass is strewn
Bring Indra to his worshippers.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  May Indra give thee skill, and lights of heaven, wealth to his votary
And priests who praise him: laud ye him.
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  O Śatakratu, wondrous strength and all our lauds I bring to thee:
Be gracious to thy worshippers.
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Bring to us all things excellent, O Śatakratu, food and strength:
For, Indra, thou art kind to us.
2§ O Śatakratu, bring to us all blessings, all felicity:
Fbr, Indra, thou art kind to us.
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Bearing the Soma juice we call, best Vṛtra-slayer, unto thee:
For, Indra, thou art kind to us.
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Come, Lord of rapturous, joys, to our libation with thy Bay Steeds, come
To our libation with thy Steeds.
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Known as best Vṛtra-slayer erst, as Indra Śatakratu, come
With Bay Steeds to the juice we shed.
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  O Vṛtra-slayer, thou art he who drinks these drops of Soma: come
With Bay Steeds to the juice we shed.
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  May Indra give, to aid us, wealth handy that rules the Skilful Ones:
Yea, may the Strong give potent wealth.

<span id="h83"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIII. Maruts.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE Cow, the famous Mother of the wealthy Maruts, pours her milk:
Both horses of the cars are yoked,—
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  She in whose bosom all the Gods, and Sun and Moon for men to see,
Maintain their everlasting Laws.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  This all the pious sing to us, and sacred poets evermore:
The Maruts to the Soma-draught
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Here is the Soma ready pressed of this the Maruts drink, of this
Self-luminous the Aśvins drink.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Of this, moreover, purified, set in three places, procreant,
Drink Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Indra, like the Herald Priest, desirous of the milky juice,
At early morn will quaff thereof.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When have the Princes gleamed and shone through waters as through troops of foes'?
When hasten they whose might ispure?
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  What favour do I claim this day of you
great Deities, you who are
Wondrously splendid in yourselves?
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  1 call, to drink the Soma, those Maruts who spread all realms of earth
And luminous regions of the sky.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  You, even such, pure in your might, you, O ye Maruts, I invoke
From heaven to drink this Somajuice.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The Maruts, those who have sustained and propped the heavens and earth apart,
I call to drink this Soma juice.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  That vigorous band of Maruts that abidetb in the mountains, I
Invoke to drink this Soma juice.

<span id="h84"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SONG-LOVER! like a charioteer come songs to thee when Soma flows.
O Indra, they have called to thee as mother-kine unto their calves.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Bright juices bitherward have sped thee, Indra, Lover of the Song.
Drink, Indra, of this flowing sap: in every house ’tis set for thee.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Drink Soma to inspirit thee, juice, Indra, which the Falcon brought:
For thou art King and Sovran Lord of all the families of men.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Indra, hear Tirasci's call, the call of him who serveth thee.
Satisfy him with wealth of kine and valiant offspring: Great art thou.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For he, O Indra, hath produced for thee the newest gladdening song,
A hymn that springs from careful thought, ancient, and full of sacred truth.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  That Indra will we laud whom songs and hymns of praise have magnified.
Striving to win, we celebrate his many deeds of hero might.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Come now and let us glorify pure Indra with pure Sāma hymns.
Let the pure milky draught delight him strengthened by pure songs of praise.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Indra, come thou pure to us, with pure assistance, pure thyself.
Pure, send thou riches down to us, and, meet for Soma, pure, be glad.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Indra, pure, vouchsafe us wealth, and, pure, enrich the worshipper.
Pure, thou dost strike the Vṛtras dead, and strivest, pure, to win the spoil.

<span id="h85"></span>

## HYMN LXXXV. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FOR him the Mornings made their courses longer, and Nights with pleasant voices spake to Indra.
For him the Floods stood still, the Seven Mothers, Streams easy for the heroes to pass over.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Darter penetrated, though in trouble, thrice-seven close-pressed ridges of the mountains.
Neither might God nor mortal man accomplish what the Strong Hero wrought in full-grown vigour.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The mightiest force is Indra's bolt of iron when firmly grasped in both the arms of Indra.
His head and mouth have powers that pass all others, and all his people hasten near to listen.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  1 count thee as the Holiest of the Holy, the caster-down of what hath ne’er been shaken.
I count thee as the Banner of the heroes, I count thee as the Chief of all men living.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What time, O Indra, in thine arms thou tookest thy wildly rushing bolt to Slay the Dragon,
The mountains roared, the cattle loudly bellowed, the Brahmans with their hymns drew nigh to Indra.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Let us praise him who made these worlds and creatures, all things that after him sprang into being.
May we win Mitra with our songs, and Indra, and. wait upon our Lord with adoration.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Flying in terror from the snort of Vṛtra, all Deities who were thy friends forsook thee.
So, Indra, be thy friendship with the Maruts: in all these battles thou shalt be the victor.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thrice-sixty Maruts, waxing strong, were with thee, like piles of beaming light, worthy of worship.
We come to thee: grant us a happy portion. Let us adore thy might with this oblation.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  A sharpened weapon is the host of Maruts. Who, Indra, dares withstand thy bolt of thunder?
Weaponless are the Asuras, the godless: scatter them with thy wheel, Impetuous Hero.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  To him the Strong and Mighty, most auspicious, send up the beAuteous hymn for sake of cattle.
Lay oa his body many songs for Indra invoked with song, for will not he regard. them?
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  To him, the Mighty, who accepts laudation, send forth thy thought as by a boat o’er rivers,
Stir with thy hymn the body of the Famous and Dearest One, for will not he regard it?
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Serve him with gifts of thine which Indra welcomes: praise with fair praise, invite him with thine homage.
Draw near, O singer, and refrain from outcry. Make thy voice heard, for will not he regard it?
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The Black Drop sank in Amsumati's bosom, advancing with ten thousand round about it.
Indra with might longed for it as it panted: the hero-hearted laid aside his weapons.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  1 saw the Drop in the far distance moving, on the slope bank of Amsumati's river,
Like a black cloud that sank into the water. Heroes, I send you forth. Go, fight in battle.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And then the Drop in Amsumati's bosom, splendid with light, assumed its proper body;
And Indra, with Bṛhaspati to aid him, conquered the godless tribes that came against him.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Then, at thy birth, thou wast the foeman, Indra, of those the seven who ne’er had met a rival.
The hidden Pair, the Heaven and Earth, thou foundest, and to the mighty worlds thou gavest pleasure.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  So, Thunder-armed! thou with thy bolt of thunder didst boldly smite that power which none might equal;
With weapons broughtest low the migbt of Śuṣṇa, and, Indra, foundest by thy strength the cattle.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Then wast thou, Chieftain of all living mortals, the very mighty slayer of the Vṛtras.
Then didst thou set the obstructed rivers flowing, and win the floods that were enthralled by Dāsas.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Most wise is he, rejoicing in libations, splendid as day, resistless in his anger.
He only doth great deeds, the only Hero, sole Vṛtra-slayer he, with none beside him.
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Indra is Vṛtra's slayer, man's sustainer: he must be called; with fair praise let us call him.
Maghavan is our Helper, our Protector, giver of spoil and wealth to make us famous.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  This Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, this Ṛbhukṣan, even at his birth, was meet for invocation.
Doer of many deeds for man's advantage, like Soma quaffed, for friends we must invoke him.

<span id="h86"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVI. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O INDRA, Lord of Light, what joys thou broughtest from the Asuras,
Prosper therewith, O Maghavan, him who lauds that deed, and those whose grass is trimmed for thee.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The unwasting share of steeds and kine which, Indra, thou hast fast secured,
Grant to the worshipper who presses Soma and gives guerdon, not unto the churl.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The riteless, godless man who sleeps, O Indra, his unbroken steep,—
May he by following his own devices die. Hide from him wealth that nourishes.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whether, O Śakra, thou be far, or, Vṛtra-slayer, near at hand,
Thence by heaven-reaching songs he who hath pressed the juice invites thee with thy long-maned Steeds.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whether thou art in heaven's bright sphere, or in the basin of the sea;
Whether, chief Vṛtra-slayer, in some place on earth, or in the firmament, approach.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou Soma-drinker, Lord of Strength, beside our flowing Soma juice
Delight us with thy bounty rich in pleasantness, O Indra, with abundant wealth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Indra, turn us not away: be the companion of our feast.
For thou art our protection, yea, thou art our kin: O Indra, turn us not away.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Sit down with us, O Indra, sit beside the juice to drink the meath.
Show forth great favour to the Singer, Maghavan; Indra, with us, beside the juice.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Caster of the Stone, nor Gods nor mortals have attained to thee.
Thou in thy might surpassest all that hath been made: the Gods have not attained to thee.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Of one accord they made and formed for kingship Indra, the Hero who in all encounters overcometh,
Most eminent for power, destroyer in the conflict, fierce and exceeding strong, stalwart and full of vigour.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Bards joined in song to Indra so that he might drink the Soma juice,
The Lord of Light, that he whose laws stand fast might aid with power and with the help he gives.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Tle holy sages form a ring, looking and singing to the Ram.
Inciters, full of vigour, not to he deceived, are with the chanters, nigh to bear.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Loudly I call that Indra, Maghavan the Mighty, who evermore possesses power, ever resistless.
Holy, most liberal, may he lead us on to riches, and, Thunder-armed, make all our pathways pleasant for us.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Thou knowest well, O Śakra, thou Most Potent, with thy strength, Indra, to destroy these castles.
Before thee, Thunder-armed! all beings tremble: the heavens and earth before thee shake with terror,
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  May thy truth, Indra, Wondrous Hero be my guard: bear me o’er much woe, Thunderer! as over floods.
When, Indra, wilt thou honour us with opulence, all-nourishing and much-to-be. desired, O King?

<span id="h87"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To Indra sing a Sāma hymn, a lofty song to Lofty Sage,
To him who guards the Law, inspired, and fain for praise.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou, Indra, art the Conqueror: thou gavest splendour to the Sun.
Maker of all things, thou art Mighty and All-God.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Radiant with light thou wentest to the sky, the luminous realm of heaven.
ne Deities, Indra strove to win thee for their Friend.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Come unto us, O Indra, dear, still conquering, unconcealable,
Vast as a mountain spread on all sides, Lord of Heaven.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O truthful Soma-drinker, thou art mightier than both the worlds.
Thou strengthenest him who pours libation, Lord of Heaven.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For thou art he, O Indra, wiio stormeth all castles of the foe,
Slayer of Dasyus, man's Supporter, Lord of Heaven.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now have we, Indra, Friend of Song, sent our great wishes forth to thee,
Coming like floods that follow floods.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  As rivers swell the ocean, so, Hero, our prayers increase thy might,
Though of thyself, O Thunderer, waxing day by day.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  With holy song mey bind to the broad wide-yoked car the Bay Steeds of the rapid God,
Bearers of Indra, yoked by word.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Indra, bring great strength to us, bring valour, Śatakratu, thou most active, bring
A hero conquering in war.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  For, gracious Śatakratu, thou hast ever been a Mother and a Sire to us,
So now for bliss we pray to thee.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  To thee, Strong, Much-invoked, who showest forth thy strength, O Śatakratu, do I speak:
So grant thou us heroic strength.

<span id="h88"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVIII. Indra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O THUNDERER, zealous worshippers gave thee drink this time yesterday.
So, Indra, listen here to those who bring the laud: come near unto our dwellingplace.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Lord of Bay Steeds, fair-helmed, rejoice thee: this we crave. Here the disposers wait on thee.
Thy loftiest glories claim our lauds beside the juice, O Indra, Lover of the Song.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Turning, as ’twere, to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all good things.
When he who will be born is born with power we look to treasures as our heritage.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Praise him who sends us wealth, whose bounties injure none: good are the gifts which Indra. grants.
He is not worth with one who satisfies his wish: he turns his mind to giving boons.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.
Father art thou, aIl-conquering, cancelling the curse, thou victor of the vanquisher.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The Earth and Heaven clung close to thy victorious might as to their calf two mother-cows.
When thou attackest Vṛtra all the hostile bands shrink and faint, Indra, at thy wrath.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Bring to your aid the Eternal One, who shoots and none may shoot at him,
Inciter, swift, victorious, best of Charioteers. Tugrya's unvanquished Strengthener;
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Arranger of things unarranged, e’en Śatakratu, source of might,
Indra, the Friend of all, for succour we invoke, Guardian of treasure, sendjng wealth.

## HYMN LXXXIX Indra. Vāk.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I MOVE before thee here present in person, and all the Deities follow behind me.
When, Indra, thou securest me my portion, with me thou shalt perform heroic actions.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The food of meath in foremost place I give thee, thy Soma shall be pressed, thy share appointed.
Thou on my right shalt be my friend and comrade: then shall we two smite dead full many a foeman.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Striving for strength bring forth a laud to Indra, a truthful hymn if he in truth existeth.
One and another say, There is no Indra. Who hath beheld him? Whom then shall we honour?
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Here am I, look upon me here, O singer. All that existeth 1 surpass in greatness.
The Holy Law's commandments make me mighty. Rending with strength I rend the worlds asunder.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When the Law's lovers mounted and ap. proached me as 1 sate lone upon the dear sky's summit.
Then spake my spirit to the heart within me, My friends have cried unto me with their children.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  All these thy deeds must be declared at Soma-feasts, wrought, Indra, Bounteous Lord, for him who sheds the juice,
When thou didst open wealth heaped up by many, brought from far away to Sarablia, the Ṛṣi's kin.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Now run ye forth your several ways: he is not here who kept you back.
For hath not Indra sunk his bolt deep down in Vṛtra's vital part?
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  On-rushing with the speed of thought within the iron fort he pressed:
The Falcon went to heaven and brought the Soma to the Thunderer.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Deep in the ocean lies the bolt with waters compassed round about,
And in continuous onward flow the floods their tribute bring to it.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  When, uttering words which no one comprehended, Vāk, Queen of Gods, the Gladdener, was seated,
The heaven's four regions drew forth drink and vigour: now whither hath her noblest portion vanished?
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The Deities generated Vāk the Goddess, and animals of every figure speak her.
May she, the Gladdener, yielding food and vigour, the Milch-cow Vāk, approach us meetly lauded.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Step forth with wider stride, my comrade Viṣṇu; make room, Dyaus, for the leaping of the lightning.
Let us slay Vṛtra, let us free the rivers let them flow loosed at the command of Indra.

## HYMN XC. Various.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YEA, specially that mortal man hath toiled for service of the Gods,
Who quickly hath brought near Mitra and Varuṇa. to share his sacrificial gifts.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Supreme in sovran power, far-sighted, Chiefs and Kings, most swift to hear from far away,
Both, wondrously, set them in motion as with arms, in company with Sūrya's beams.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The rapid messenger who runs before you, Mitra-Varuṇa, with iron head, swift to the draught,
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He whom no man may question, none may summon back, who stands not still for colloquy,—
From hostile clash with him keep ye us safe this day: keep us in safety with your arms.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To Aryaman and Mitra sing a reverent song, O pious one,
A pleasant hymn that shall protect to Varuṇa: sing forth a laud unto the Kings.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The true, Red Treasure they have sent, one only Son born of the Three.
They, the Immortal Ones, never deceived, survey the families of mortal men.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  My songs are lifted up, and acts most splendid are to be performed.
Come hither, ye Nāsatyas, with accordant mind, to meet and to enjoy my gifts.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Lords of great wealth, when we invoke your bounty which no demon checks,
Both of you, furthering our eastward-offcred praise, come, Chiefs whom Jamadagni lauds!
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Come, Vāyu, drawn by fair hymns, to our sacrifice that reaches heaven.
Poured on the middle of the strainingcloth, and cooked, this bright drink hath been offered ilice.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He comes by straightest paths, as ministering Priest, to taste the sacrificial gifts.
Then, Lord of harnessed teams I drink of the twofold draught, bright Soma mingled with the milk.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Verily, Sūrya, thou art great; truly, Āditya, thou art great.
As thou art great indeed, thy greatness is admired: yea, verily, thou, God, art great.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Yea, Sūrya, thou art great in fame thou evermore, O God, art great.
Thou by thy greatness art the Gods’ High Priest, divine, far-spread unconquerable light.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  She yonder, bending lowly down, clothed in red hues and rich in rays,
Is seen, advancing as it were with various tints, amid the ten surrounding arms.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Past and gone are three mortal generations: the fourth and last into the Sun hath entered.
He mid the worlds his lofty place hath taken. Into green plants is gone the Purifying.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  The Rudras' Mother, Daughter of the Vasus, centre of nectar, the Ādityas’ Sister-
To folk who understand will 1 proclaim it-injure not Aditi, the Cow, the sinless.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Weak-minded men have as a cow adopted me who came hither from the Gods, a Goddess,
Who, skilled in eloquence, her voice uplifteth, who standeth near at hand with all devotions.
