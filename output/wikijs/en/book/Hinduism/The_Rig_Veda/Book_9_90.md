## HYMN LXXXI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ONWARD to Indra's throat move, beauteously adorned, the waves of Soma as he purifies himself,
When they, brought forward with the lovely curd of kine, effused, have cheered the Hero to bestow his gifts.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Hither hath Soma flowed unto the beakers, like a chariot-horse, a stallion swift upon his way.
Thus, knowing both the generations, he obtains the rights and dues of Gods from yonder and from hence.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  While thou art cleansed, O Soma, scatter wealth on us; Indu, bestow great bounty as a liberal Prince.
Giver of life, with wisdom help to opulence; strew not our home possessions far away from us.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Hither let Pūṣan Pavamana come to us, Varuṇa, Mitra, bountiful, of one accord,
The Maruts, Aśvins, Vāyu, and Bṛhaspati, Savitar, Tvaṣṭar, tractable Sarasvatī.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Both Heaven and Earth, the all-invigorating Pair, Vidhatar, Aditi, and Aryaman the God,
Bhaga who blesses men, the spacious Firmament,—let all the Gods in Pavamana take delight.

<span id="h82"></span>

## HYMN LXXXII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  EVEN as a King hath Soma, red and tawny Bull, been pressed: the Wondrous One hath bellowed to the kine.
While purified he passes through the filtering fleece to seat him hawk-like on the place that drops with oil.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To glory goest thou, Sage with disposing skill, like a groomed steed thou rusbest forward to the prize.
O Soma, be thou gracious, driving off distress: thou goest, clothed in butter, to a robe of state.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Parjanya is the Father of the Mighty Bird: on mountains, in earth's centre hath he made his home.
The waters too have flowed, the Sisters, to the kine: he meets the pressing-stones at the beloved rite.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou givest pleasure as a wife delights her lord. Listen, O Child of Pajri, for to thee I speak.
Amid the holy songs go on that we may live: in time of trouble, Soma, watch thou free from blame.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As to the men of old thou camest, Indu unharmed, to strengthen, winning hundreds, thousands,
So now for new felicity flow onward: the waters follow as thy law ordaineth.

<span id="h83"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SPREAD is thy cleansing filter, Brahmaṇaspati: as Prince, thou enterest its limbs from every side.
The raw, whose mass hath not been heated gains not this: they only which are dressed, which bear, attain to it.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  High in the seat of heaven is spread the Scorcher's sieve: its threads are standing separate, glittering with light.
The Swift Ones favour him who purifieth this: with consciousness they stand upon the height of heaven.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The foremost spotted Steer hath made the Mornings shine, and yearning after strength sustains all things that be.
By his high wisdom have the mighty Sages wrought: the Fathers who behold mankind laid down the germ,
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Gandharva verily protects his dwellingplace; Wondrous, he guards the generations of the Gods.
Lord of the snare, he takes the foeman with the snare: those who are most devout have gained a share of meath.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Rich in oblations! robed in cloud, thou corapassest oblation, sacrifice, the mighty seat of Gods.
King, on thy chariot-sieve thou goest up to war, and with a thousand weapons winnest lofty fame.

<span id="h84"></span>

## HYMN LXXXIV. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FLOW, cheering Gods, most active, winner of the flood, for Indra, and for Vāyu, and for Varuṇa.
Bestow on us to-day wide room with happiness, and in tbine ample dwelling laud the Host of Heaven.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He who hath come anear to creatures that have life, Immortal Soma flows onward to all of them.
Effecting, for our aid, both union and release, Indu, like Sūrya, follows closely after Dawn.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He who is poured with milk, he who within the plants hastes bringing treasure for the happiness of Gods,
He, poured forth in a stream flows with the lightning's flash, Soma who gladdens Indra and the Host of Heaven.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Winner of thousands, he, this Soma, flows along, raising a vigorous voice that wakens with the dawn.
Indu with winds drives on the ocean of the air, he sinks within the jars, he rests in Indra's heart.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The kine with milk dress him who makes the milk increase, Soma, amid the songs, who finds the light of heaven.
Winner of wealth, the effectual juice is flowing on, Singer and Sage by wisdom, dear as heaven itself.

<span id="h85"></span>

## HYMN LXXXV. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FLOW on to Indra, Soma, carefully effused: let sickness stay afar together with the fiends.
Let not the double-tongued delight them with thy juice. here be thy flowing drops laden with opulence.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Pavamana, urge us forward in the fight thou art the vigour of the Gods, the well-loved drink.
Smite thou our enemies who raise the shout of joy: Indra, drink Soma juice, and drive away our foes.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Unharmed, best Cheerer, thou, O Indu, flowest on: thou, even thou thyself, art Indra's noblest food.
Full many a wise man lifts to thee the song of praise, and hails thee with a kiss as Sovran of this world.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Wondrous, with hundred streams, hymned in a thousand songs, Indu pours out for Indra his delightrul meath.
Winning us land and waters, flow thou hitherward: Rainer of bounties, Soma, make broad way for us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Roaring within the beaker thou art balmed with milk: thou passest through the fleecy filter all at once.
Carefully cleansed and decked like a prizewinning steed, O Soma, thou hast flowed down within Indra's throat.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Flow onward sweet of flavour for the Heavenly Race, for Indra sweet, whose name is easily invoked:
Flow sweet for Mitra, Varuṇa, and Vāyu, rich in meath, inviolable for Bṛhaspati.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ten rapid fingers deck the Courser in the jar: with hymns the holy singers send their voices forth.
The filtering juices hasten to their eulogy, the drops that gladden find their way to Indra's heart.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  While thou art purified pour on us hero strength, great, far-extended shelter, spacious pasturage.
Let no oppression master this our holy work: may we, O Indu, gain all opulence through thee.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The Steer who sees afar hath risen above the sky: the Sage hath caused the lights of heaven to give their shine.
The. King is passing through the filter with a roar: they drain the milk of heaven from him who looks on men.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  High in the vault of heaven, unceasing, honey-tongued, the Loving Ones drain out the mountain-haunting Steer,—
The drop that hath grown great in waters, in the lake meath-rich, in the stream's wave and in the cleansing sieve.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The Loving Ones besought with many voices the Eagle who had flown away to heaven.
Hymns kiss the Youngling worthy of laudation, resting on earth, the Bird of golden colour.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  High to heaven's vault hath the Gandharva risen, beholding all his varied forms and figures.
His ray hath shone abroad with gleaming splendour: pure, he hath lighted both the worlds, the Parents.

<span id="h86"></span>

## HYMN LXXXVI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THY gladdening draughts, O Pavamana, urged by song flow swiftly of themselves like sons of fleet-foot mares.
The drops of Soma juice, those eagles of the heavens, most cheering, rich in meath, rest in the reservoir.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As rapid chariot-steeds, so turned in several ways have thine exhilarating juices darted forth,
Soma-drops rich in meath, waves, to the Thunder-armed, to Indra, like milch-kine who seek their calf with milk.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Like a steed urged to battle, finder of the light; speed onward to the cloud-born reservoir of heaven,
A Steer that o’er the woolly surface seeks the sieve, Soma while purified for Indra's nourishment.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Fleet as swift steeds, thy drops, divine, thought-swift, have been, O Pavamana, poured with milk into the vat.
The Ṛṣis have poured in continuous Soma drops, ordainers who adorn thee, Friend whom Ṛṣis love.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O thou who seest all things, Sovran as thou art and passing strong, thy rays encompass all abodes.
Pervading with thy natural powers thou flowest on, and as the whole world's Lord, O Soma, thou art King.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The beams of Pavamana, sent from earth and heaven, his ensigns who is ever steadfast, travel round.
When on the sieve the Golden-hued is cleansed, he rests within the vats as one who seats him in his place.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Served with fair rites he flows, ensign of sacrifice: Soma advances to the special place of Gods.
He speeds with thousand currents to the reservoir, and passes through the filter bellowing as a bull.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The Sovran dips him in the seain and the streams, and set in rivers with the waters' wave moves on.
High heaven's Sustainer at the central point of earth, raised on the fleecy surface Pavamana stands.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  He on whose high decree the heavens and earth depend nath roared and thundered like the summit of the sky.
Soma flows on obtaining Indra's friendly love, and, as they purify him, settles in the jars.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He, light of sacrifice distils delicious meath, most wealthy, Father and begetter of the Gods.
He, gladdening, best of Cheerers, juice!hat Indra loves, enriches with mysterious treasure earth and heaven.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The vigorous and far-seeing one, the Lord of heaven, flows, shouting to the beaker, with his thousand streams.
Coloured like gold he rests in seats where Mitra dwells, the Steer made beautiful by rivers and by sheep.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  In forefront of the rivers Pavamana speeds, in forefront of the hymn, foremost among the kine.
He shares the mighty booty in the van of war: the well-armed Steer is purified by worshippers.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  This heedful Pavamana, like a bird sent forth, hath with his wave flowed onward to the fleecy sieve.
O Indra, through thy wisdom, b thy thought, O Sage, Soma flows bright and pure between the earth and heaven.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He, clad in mail that reaches heaven, the Holy One, filling the firmament stationed amid the worlds,
Knowing. the realm of light, hath come to us in rain: he summons to himself his own primeval Sire.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He who was first of all to penetrate his form bestowed upon his race wide shelter and defence.
From that high station which he hath in loftiest heaven he comes victorious to all encounters here.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Indu hath started for Indra's special place and slights not as a Friend the promise of his Friend.
Soma speeds onward like a youth to youtlitial maids, and gains the beaker by a course of bundred paths.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Your songs, exhilarating, tuneful, uttering praise, are come into the placns where the people meet.
Worshippers have exalted Soma with their hymns, and milch kine have come near to meet him with their milk.
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  O Soma, Indu, while they cleanse thee, pour on us accumulateds Plentiful, nutritious food,
Which, ceaseless, thrice a day shall yield us hero power enriched with store of nourishment, and strength, and Meath.
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Far-seeing Soma flows, the Steer, the Lord of hymns, the Furtherer of day, of morning, and of heaven.

<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  On, with the prudent singers, flows the ancient Sage and guided by the men hath roared about the vats.
Producing Trita's name, may he pour forth the meath, that Vāyu and that Indra may become his Friends.
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He, being purified, hath made the Mornings shine: this, even this is he who gave the rivers room.
He made the Three Times Seven pour out the milky flow: Soma, the Cheerer, yields whate’er the heart finds sweet.
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Flow, onward, Soma, in thine own celestial forms, flow, Indu, poured within the beaker and the sieve.
Sinking into the throat of Indra with a roar, led by the men thou madest Sūrya mount to heaven.
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Pressed out with stones thou flowest onward to the sieve, O Indu, entering the depths of Indra's throat.
Far-sighted Soma, now thou lookest on mankind: thou didst unbar the cowstall for the Aṅgirases.
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  In thee, O Soma, while thou purifitedst thee, high-thoughted sages, seeking favour, have rejoiced.
Down from the heavens the Falcon brought thee hitherward, even thee, O Indu, thee whom all our hymns adorn.
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Seven Milch-kine glorify the Tawny-coloured One while with his wave in wool he purifies himself.
The living men, the mighty, have impelled the Sage into the waters' lap, the place of sacrifice.
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Indu, attaining purity, plunges through the foe, making Ilis ways all easy for the pious man.
Making the kine his mantle, he, the lovely Sage, runs like a sporting courser onward through the fleece.

Hymns have been sung aloud in resonant harmony, and holy songs kiss him, the Child who claims our praise.

May they pour forth for thee milk and oil rich in sweets: O Soma, let the folk abide in thy decree.

<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Soma, gladden Varuṇa and Mitra; cheer, Indu Pavamana! Indra, Viṣṇu.
Cheer thou the Gods, the Company of Maruts: Indu, cheer mighty Indra to rejoicing.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thus like a wise and potent King flow onward, destroying with thy vigour all misfortunes.
For our well-spoken hymn give life, O Indu. Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings.
