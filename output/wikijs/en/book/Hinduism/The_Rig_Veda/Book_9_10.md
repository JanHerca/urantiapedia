Pressed out for Indra, for his drink.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Fiend-queller, Friend of all men, he hath with the wood attained unto
His place, his iron-fashioned home.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Be thou best Vṛtra-slayer, best granter of bliss, most liberal:
Promote our wealthy princes' gifts.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Flow onward with thy juice unto the banquet of the Mighty Gods:
Flow hither for our strength and fame.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Indu, we draw nigh to thee, with this one object day by day:
To thee alone our prayers are said
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  By means of this eternal fleece may Sūrya's Daughter purify
Thy Soma that is foaming forth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ten sister maids of slender form seize him within the press and hold
Him firmly on the final day.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The virgins send him forth: they blow the the skin musician-like and fuse
The triple foe-repelling meath.

The fresh young Soma with their milk.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  In the wild raptures of this draught, Indra slays all the Vṛtras: he,
The Hero, pours his wealth on us.

When thou wilt clothe thee with the milk.

Falls on the purifying cloth.

He shines together with the Sun.

Thou deckest thee for our delight.

Inviolable as he flows.

Rich gifts upon the worshipper.

And roars as he is flowing on.

The regions, irresistible.

Is worshipped, God amid the Gods.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The golden, the Celestial Doors are lifted with their frames on high,
By Pavamana glorified.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  With passion Pavamana longs for the great lofty pair, well-formed
Like beauteous maidens, Night and Dawn
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Both Gods who look on men I call, Celestial Heralds: Indra's Self
Is Pavamana, yea, the Bull.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  This, Pavamana's sacrifice, shall the three beauteous Goddesses,
Sarasvatī and Bhāratī and Iḷā, Mighty One, attend.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SOMA, flow on with pleasant stream, a Bull devoted to the Gods,
Our Friend, unto the woollen sieve.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Pour hitherward, as Indra's Self, Indu, that gladdening stream of thine,
And send us coursers full of strength.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Flow to the filter hitherward, pouring that ancient gladdening juice,
Streaming forth power and high renown.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Hither the sparkling drops have flowed, like waters down a steep descent
They have reached Indra purified.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whom, having passed the filter, ten dames cleanse, as ’twere a vigorous steed,
While he disports him in the wood,—
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The steer-strong juice with milk pour forth, for feast and service of the Gods,
To him who bears away the draught.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Effused, the God flows onward with his stream to Indra, to the God,
So that his milk may strengthen him.

Gain thee, and progeny and food.

Have Soma-drops flowed forth for wealth.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Forth have they rushed from holding hands, like chariots that are urged to speed,
Like joyful songs of singing-men.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Somas deck themselves with milk, as Kings are graced with eulogies,
And, with seven priests, the sacrifice.

The Soma juices in a stream.

Men, for the mighty to accept.

The Sage's ofrspring hath appeared.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The Sun with his dear eye beholds that quarter of the heavens which priests
Have placed within the sacred cell.
