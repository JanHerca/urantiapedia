## HYMN LI. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FORTH from the darkness in the region eastward this most abundant splendid light hatb mounted.
Now verily the far-refulgent Mornings, Daughters of Heaven, bring welfare to the people.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The richly-coloured Dawns have mounted eastward, like pillars planted at our sacrifices,
And, flushing far, splendid and purifying, unbarred the portals of the fold of darkness.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Dispelling gloom this day the wealthy Mornings urge liberal givers to present their treasures.
In the unlightened depth of darkness round them let niggard traffickers sleep unawakened.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Goddesses, is this your car, I ask you, ancient this day, or is it new, ye Mornings,
Wherewith, rich Dawns, ye seek with wealth Navagva, Daśagva Aṅgira, the seven-toned singer?
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  With horses harnessed by eternal Order, Goddesses, swiftly round the worlds ye travel,
Arousing from their rest, O Dawns, the sleeping, and all that lives, man, bird, and beast, to motion.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Which among these is eldest, and where is she through whom they fixed the Ṛbhus' regulations?
What time the splendid Dawns go forth for splendour, they are not known apart, alike, unwasting.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Blest were these Dawns of old, shining with succour, true with the truth that springs from holy Order;
With whom the toiling worshipper, by praises, hymning and lauding, soon attained to riches.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Hither from eastward all at once they travel, from one place spreading in the selfsame manner.
Awaking, from the seat of holy Order the Godlike Dawns come nigh like troops of cattle.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thus they go forth with undiminished colours, these Mornings similar, in self-same fashion,
Concealing the gigantic might of darkness with radiant bodies bright and pure and shining.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Goddesses, O Heaven's refulgent Daughters, bestow upon us wealth with store of children.
As from our pleasant place of rest ye rouse us may we be masters of heroic vigour.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Well-skilled in lore of sacrifice, ye Daughters of Heaven, refulgent Dawns, I thus address you.
May we be glorious among the people. May Heaven vouchsafe us this, and Earth the Goddess,

## HYMN LII. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THIS Lady, giver of delight, after her Sister shining forth, Daughter of Heaven, hath shown herself.-
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Unfailing, Mother of the Kine, in colour like a bright red mare,
The Dawn became the Aśvins' Friend.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yea, and thou art the Aśvins' Friend, the Mother of the Kine art thou:
O Dawn thou rulest over wealth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thinking of thee, O joyous One, as her who driveth hate away,
We woke to meet thee with our lauds.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Our eyes behold thy blessed rays like troops of cattle loosed to feed.
Dawn hath filled full the wide expanse.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  When thou hast filled it, Fulgent One! thou layest bare the gloom with light.
After thy nature aid us, Dawn.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou overspreadest heaven with rays, the dear wide region of mid-air.
With thy bright shining lustre, Dawn.

## HYMN LIII. Savitar.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  OF Savitar the God, the sapient Asura, we crave this great gift which is worthy of our choice,
Wherewith he freely grants his worshiper defence. This with his rays the Great God hath vouchsafed to us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Sustainer of the heaven, Lord of the whole world's life, the Sage, he putteth on his golden-coloured mail.
Clear-sighted, spreading far, filling the spacious realm, Savitar hath brought forth bliss that deserveth laud.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He hath filled full the regions of the heaven and earth: the God for his own strengthening waketh up the hymn.
Savitar hath stretched out his arms to cherish life, producing with his rays and lulling all that moves.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Lighting all living creatures, ne’er to be deceived, Savitar, God, protects each holy ordinance.
He hath stretched out his arms to all the folk of earth, and, with his laws observed, rules his own mighty course.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Savitar thrice surrounding with his mightiness mid-air, three regions, and the triple sphere of light,
Sets the three heavens in motion and the threefold earth, and willingly protects us with his triple law.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Most gracious God, who brings to life and lulls to rest, he who controls the world, what moves not and what moves,
May he vouchsafe us shelter,—Savitar the God,—for tranquil life, with triple bar against distress.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  With the year's seasons hath Savitar, God, come nigh: may he prosper our home, give food and noble sons.
May he invigorate us through the days and nights, and may he send us opulence with progeny.

## HYMN LIV. Savitar.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Now must we praise and honour Savitar the God: at this time of the day the men must call to him,
Him who distributes wealth to Manu's progeny, that he may grant us here riches most excellent.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For thou at first producest for the holy Gods the noblest of all portions, immortality:
Thereafter as a gift to men, O Savitar, thou openest existence, life succeeding life.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  If we, men as we are, have sinned against the Gods through want of thought, in weakness, or through insolence,
Absolve us from the guilt and make us free from sin, O Savitar, alike among both Gods and men.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  None may impede that power of Savitar the God whereby he will maintain the universal world.
What the fair-fingered God brings forth on earth's expanse or in the height of heaven, that work of his stands sure.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To lofty hills thou sendest those whom Indra leads, and givest fixed abodes with houses unto these.
However they may fly and draw themselves apart, still, Savitar, they stand obeying thy behest.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  May the libations poured to thee thrice daily, day after day, O Savitar, bring us blessing.
May Indra, Heaven, Earth, Sindhu with the Waters, Aditi with Ādityas, give us shelter.

## HYMN LV. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHO of you, Vasus, saveth? who protecteth? O Heaven and Earth and Aditi, preserve us,
Varuṇa., Mitra, from the stronger mortal. Gods, which of you at sacrifice giveth comfort?
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They who with laud extol the ancient statutes, when they shine forth infallible dividers,
Have ordered as perpetual Ordainers, and beamed as holy-thoughted Wonder-Workers.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Housewife Goddess, Aditi, and Sindhu, the Goddess Svasti I implore for friendship:
And may the unobstructed Night and Morning both, day and night, provide for our protection.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Aryaman, Varuṇa have disclosed the pathway, Agni as Lord of Strength the road to welfare.
Lauded in manly mode may Indra-Viṣṇu grant us their powerful defence and shelter.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I have besought the favour of the Maruts, of Parvata, of Bhaga God who rescues.
From trouble caused by man the Lord preserve us; from woe sent by his friend let Mitra save us.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Agree, through these our watery oblations, Goddesses, Heaven and Earth, with Ahibudhnya.
As if to win the sea, the Gharma-heaters have opened, as they come anear, the rivers.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May Goddess Aditi with Gods defend us, save us the saviour God with care unceasing.
We dare not stint the sacred food of Mitra and Varuṇa upon the back of Agni.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Agni is Sovran Lord of wealth, Agni of great prosperity:
May he bestow these gifts on us.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Hither to us, rich pleasant Dawn, bring many things to be desired,
Thou who hast ample store of wealth.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So then may Bhaga, Savitar, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Indra, with bounty come to us.

## HYMN LVI. Heaven and Earth.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY mighty Heaven and Earth, most meet for honour, be present here with light and gleaming splendours;
When, fixing them apart, vast, most extensive, the Steer roars loudly in far-reaching courses.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Goddesses with Gods, holy with holy, the Two stand pouring out their rain, exhaustless:
Faithful and guileless, having Gods for children, leaders of sacrifice with shining splendours.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Sure in the worlds he was a skilful Craftsman, he who produced these Twain the Earth and Heaven.
Wise, with his power he brought both realms, together spacious and deep, well-fashioned, unsupported.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O Heaven and Earth, with one accord promoting, with high protection as of Queens, our welfare,
Far-reaching, universal, holy, guard us. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To both of you, O Heaven and Earth, we bring our lofty song of praise,
Pure Ones! to glorify you both.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ye sanctify each other's form, by your own proper might ye rule,
And from of old observe the Law.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Furthering and fulfilling, ye, O Mighty, perfect Mitra's Law.
Ye sit around our sacrifice.

## HYMN LVII. Ksetrapati, Etc.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WE through the Master of the Field, even as through a friend, obtain
What nourisheth our kine and steeds. In such may he be good to us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As the cow yieldeth milk, pour for us freely, Lord of the Field, the wave that beareth sweetness,
Distilling meath, well-purified like butter, and let the. Lords of holy Law be gracious.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Sweet be the plants for us. the heavens, the waters, and full of sweets for us be air's mid-region.
May the Field's Lord for us be full of sweetness, and may we follow after him uninjured.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Happily work our steers and men, may the plough furrow happily.
Happily be the traces bound; happily may he ply the goad.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Śuna and Sīra, welcome ye this laud, and with the milk which ye have made in heaven
Bedew ye both this earth of ours.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Auspicious Sītā, come thou near: we venerate and worship thee
That thou mayst bless and prosper us and bring us fruits abundantly.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May Indra press the furrow down, may Pūṣan guide its course aright.
May she, as rich in milk, be drained for us through each succeeding year.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Happily let the shares turn up the plough-land, happily go the ploughers with the oxen.
With meath and milk Parjanya make us happy. Grant us prosperity, Śuna and Sīra.

## HYMN LVIII. Ghṛta.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FORTH from the ocean sprang the wave of sweetness: together with the stalk it turned to Amṛta,
That which is holy oil's mysterious title: but the Gods’ tongue is truly Amṛta's centre.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let us declare aloud the name of Ghṛta, and at this sacrifice hold it up with homage.
So let the Brahman hear the praise we utter. This hath the four-horned Buffalo emitted.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Four are his horns, three are the feet that bear him; his heads are two, his hands are seven in number.
Bound with a triple bond the Steer roars loudly: the mighty God hath entered in to mortals.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  That oil in triple shape the Gods discovered laid down within the Cow, concealed by Paṇis.
Indra produced one shape, Sūrya another: by their own power they formed the third from Vena.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  From inmost reservoir in countless channels flow down these rivers which the foe beholds not.
I look upon the streams of oil descending, and lo! the Golden Reed is there among them.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves in inmost heart and spirit.
The streams of holy oil pour swiftly downward like the wild beasts that fly before the bowman.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  As rushing down the rapids of a river, flow swifter than the wind the vigorous currents,
The streams of oil in swelling fluctuation like a red courser bursting through the fences.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Like women at a gathering fair to look on and gently smiling, they incline to Agni.
The streams of holy oil attain the fuel, and Jātavedas joyfully receives them.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  As maidens dock themselves with gay adornment to join the bridal feast, I now behold them.
Where Soma flows and sacrifice is ready, thither the streams of holy oil are running.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Send to our eulogy a herd of cattle bestow upon us excellent possessions.
Bear to the Gods the sacrifice we offer the streams of oil flow pure and full of sweetness.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The universe depends upon thy power and might within the sea, within the heart, within all life.
