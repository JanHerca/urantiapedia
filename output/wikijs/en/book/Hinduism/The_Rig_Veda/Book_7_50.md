## HYMN XLI. Bhaga.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AGNI at dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuṇa and Mitra, and the Aśvins twain.
Bhaga at dawn, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, Soma at dawn, Rudra we will invoke at dawn.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  We will invoke strong, early-conquering Bhaga, the Son of Aditi, the great supporter:
Thinking of whom, the poor, yea, even the mighty, even the King himself says, Give me Bhaga.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bhaga our guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this song, and give us wealth, O Bhaga.
Bhaga, augment our store of kine and horses, Bhaga, may we be rich in men and heroes.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So may felicity be ours at present, and when the day approaches, and at noontide;
And may we still, O Bounteous One, at sunset be happy in the Deities' loving-kindness.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May Bhaga verily be bliss-bestower, and through him, Gods! may happiness attend us.
As such, O Bhaga, all with might invoke thee: as such be thou our Champion here, O Bhaga.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  To this our worship may all Dawns incline them, and come to the pure place like Dadhikrāvan.
As strong steeds draw a chariot may they bring us hitherward Bhaga who discovers treasure.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  May blessed Mornings dawn on us for ever, with wealth of kine, of horses, and of heroes,
Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h42"></span>

## HYMN XLII Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LET Brahmans and Aṅgirases come forward, and let the roar of cloudy heaven surround us.
Loud low the Milch-kine swimming in the waters: set be the stones that grace our holy service.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Fair, Agni, is thy long-known path to travel: yoke for the juice tfiy bay, thy ruddy horses,
Or red steeds, Hero-bearing, for the chamber. Seated, I call the Deities' generations.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They glorify your sacrifice with worship, yet the glad Priest near them is left unequalled.
Bring the Gods hither, thou of many aspects: turn hitherward Aramati the Holy.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  What time the Guest hath made himself apparent, at ease reclining in the rich man's dwelling,
Agni, well-pleased, well-placed within the chamber gives to a house like this wealth worth the choosing.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Accept this sacrifice of ours, O Agni; glorify it with Indra and the Maruts.
Here on our grass let Night and Dawn be seated: bring longing Varuṇa and Mitra hither.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thus hath Vasiṣṭha praised victorious Agni, yearning for wealth that giveth all subsistence.
May he bestow on us food, strength, and riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h43"></span>

## HYMN XLIII Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SING out the pious at your sacrifices to move with adorations Earth and Heaven-
The Holy Singers, whose unmatched devotions, like a tree's branches, part in all directions.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let sacrifice proceed like some fleet courser: with one accord lift ye on high the ladles.
Strew sacred grass meet for the solenm service: bright flames that love the Gods have mounted upward.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Like babes in arms reposing on their mother, let the Gods sit upon the grass's summit.
Let general fire make bright the flame of worship: scorn us not, Agni, in the Gods’ assembly.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Gladly the Gods have let themselves be honoured, milking the copious streams of holy Order.
The highest might to-day is yours, the Vasits': come ye, as many as ye are, one-minded.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  So, Agni, send us wealth among the people: may we be closely knit to thee, O Victor,
Unharmed, and rich, and taking joy together. Preserve us evermore, ye ods, with blessings.

<span id="h44"></span>

## HYMN XLIV. Dadhikrās.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I CALL on Dadhikrās, the first, to give you aid, the Aśvins, Bhaga, Dawn, and Agni kindled well,
Indra, and Viṣṇu, Pūṣan, Brahmaṇaspati, Ādityas, Heaven and Earth, the Waters, and the Light.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When, rising, to the sacrifice we hasten, awaking Dadhikrās with adorations.
Seating on sacred grass the Goddess Iḷā. let us invoke the sage swift-hearing Aśvins.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  While I am thus arousing Dadhikrāvan I speak to Agni, Earth, and Dawn, and Sūrya,
The red, the brown of Varuṇa ever mindful: may they ward off from us all grief and trouble.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Foremost is Dadhikrāvan, vigorous courser; in forefront of the cars, his way he knoweth,
Closely allied with Sūrya and with Morning, Ādityas, and Aṅgirases, and Vasus.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May Dadhikrās prepare the way we travel that we may pass along the path of Order.
May Agni bear us, and the Heavenly Army: hear us all Mighty Ones whom none deceiveth.

<span id="h45"></span>

## HYMN XLV. Savitar.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY the God Savitar, rich in goodly treasures, filling the region, borne by steeds, come hither,
In his hand holding much that makes men happy, lulling to slumber and arousing creatures.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Golden, sublime, and easy in their motion, his arms extend unto the bounds of heaven.
Now shall that mightiness of his he lauded: even Sūrya yields to him in active vigour.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May this God Savitar, the Strong and Mighty, the Lord of precious wealth, vouchsafe us treasures.
May he, advancing his far-spreading lustre, bestow on us the food that feedeth mortals.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  These songs praise Savitar whose tongue is pleasant, praise him whose arms are full, whose hands are lovely.
High vital strength, and manifold, may he grant us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h46"></span>

## HYMN XLVI. Rudra.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To Rudra bring these songs, whose bow is firm and strong, the self-dependent God with swiftly-flying shafts,
The Wise, the Conqueror whom none may overcome, armed with sharp-pointed weapons: may he hear our call.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He through his lordship thinks on beings of the earth, on heavenly beings through his high imperial sway.
Come willingly to our doors that gladly welcome thee, and heal all sickness, Rudra., in our families.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May thy bright arrow which, shot down by thee from heaven, flieth upon the earth, pass us uninjured by.
Thou, very gracious God, hast thousand medicines: inflict no evil on our sons or progeny.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Slay us not, nor abandon us, O Rudra let not thy noose, when thou art angry, seize us.
Give us trimmed grass and fame among the living. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h47"></span>

## HYMN XLVII. Waters.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MAY we obtain this day from you, O Waters, that wave of pure refreshment, which the pious
Made erst the special beverage of Indra, bright, stainless, rich in sweets and dropping fatness.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May the Floods' Offspring, he whose course is rapid, protect that wave most rich in sweets, O Waters,
That shall make Indra and the Vasus joyful. This may we gain from you to-day, we pious.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  All-purifying, joying in their nature, to paths of Gods the Goddesses move onward.
They never violate the laws of Indra. Present the oil-rich offering to the Rivers.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whom Sūrya with his bright beams hath attracted, and Indra dug the path for them to travel,
May these Streams give us ample room and freedom. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h48"></span>

## HYMN XLVIII. Ṛbhus.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YE liberal Heroes, Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, come and delight you with our flowing Soma.
May your strength, Vibhus, as ye come to meet us, turn hitherward your car that brings men profit.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May we as Ṛbhu with your Ṛbhus conquer strength with our strength, as Vibhus with the Vibhus.
May Vāja aid us in the fight for booty, and helped by Indra may we quell the foeman.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For they rule many tribes with high dominion, and conquer all their foes in close encounter.
May Indra, Vibhvan, Vāja, and Ṛbhukṣan destroy by turns the wicked foeman's valour.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Now, Deities, give us ample room and freedom: be all of you, one-minded, our protection.
So let the Vasus grant us strength and vigour. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="h49"></span>

## HYMN XLIX. Waters.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FORTH from the middle of the flood the Waters-their chief the Sea-flow cleansing, never sleeping.
Indra, the Bull, the Thunderer, dug their channels: here let those Waters, Goddesses, protect me.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Waters which come from heaven, or those that wander dug from the earth, or flowing free by nature,
Bright, purifying, speeding to the Ocean, here let those Waters. Goddesses, protect me.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Those amid whom goes Varuṇa the Sovran, he who discriminates men's truth and falsehood-
Distilling meath, the bright, the purifying, here let those Waters, Goddesses, protect me.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  They from whom Varuṇa the King, and Soma, and all the Deities drink strength and vigour,
They into whom Vaiśvānara Agni entered, here let those Waters, Goddesses, protect Me.

<span id="h50"></span>

## HYMN L. Various Deities.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O MITRA-VARUNA, guard and protect me here: let not that come to me which nests within and swells.
I drive afar the scorpion hateful to the sight: let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Eruption that appears upon the twofold joints, and that which overspreads the ankles and the knees,
May the refulgent Agni banish far away let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The poison that is formed upon the Salmali, that which is found in streams, that which the plants produce,
All this may all the Gods banish and drive away: let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The steep declivities, the valleys, and the heights, the channels full of water, and the waterless-
May those who swell with water, gracious Goddesses, never afflict us with the Sipada disease, may all the rivers keep us free from Simida.
