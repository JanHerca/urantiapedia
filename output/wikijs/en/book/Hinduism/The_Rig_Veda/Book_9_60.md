## HYMN LI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  ADHVARYU, on the filter pour the Soma juice expressed with stones,
And make it pure for Indra's drink.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Pour out for Indra, Thunder-armed, the milk of heaven,, the Soma's juice,
Most excellent, most rich in sweets.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These Gods and all the Marut host, Indu enjoy this juice of thine,
This Pavamana's flowing meath.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For, Soma, thou hast been effused, strengthening for the wild carouse,
O Steer, the singer, for our help.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Flow with thy stream, Far-sighted One, effused, into the cleansing sieve:
Flow on to give us strength and fame.

## HYMN LII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WEALTH-WINNER, dwelling in the sky, bringing us vigour with the juice,
Flow to the filter when effused.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So, in thine ancient ways, may he, beloved, with a thousand streams
Run o’er the fleecy straining-cloth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Him who is like a caldron shake: O Indu, shake thy gift to us
Shake it, armed Warrior! with thine arms.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indu, invoked with many a prayer, bring down the vigour of these men,
Of him who threatens us with war.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Indu, Wealth-giver, with thine help pour out for us a hundred, yea,
A thousand of thy pure bright streams.

## HYMN LIII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O THOU with stones for arms, thy powers, crushing the fiends, have raised themselves:
Chase thou the foes who compass us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thou conquerest thus with might when car meets car, and when the prize is staked:
With fearless heart will I sing praise.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  No one with evil thought assails this Pavamana's holy laws:
Crush him who fain would fight with thee.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For Indra to the streams they drive the tawny rapture-dropping Steed,
Indu the bringer of delight.

## HYMN LIV. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AFTER his ancient splendour, they, the bold, have drawn the bright milk from
The Sage who wins a thousand gifts.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  In aspect he is like the Sun; he runneth forward to the lakes,
Seven currents flowing through the sky.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He, shining in his splendour, stands high over all things that exist-
Soma, a God as Sūrya is.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou, Indu, in thy brilliancy, pourest on us, as Indra's Friend,
Wealth from the kine to feast the Gods.

## HYMN LV. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  POUR on us with thy juice all kinds of corn, each sort of nourishment,
And, Soma, all felicities.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As thine, O Indu, is the praise, and thine what springeth from the juice,
Seat thee on the dear sacred grass.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And, finding for us kine and steeds, O Soma, with thy juice flow on
Through days that fly most rapidly.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As one who conquers, ne’er subdued, attacks and stays the enemy,
Thus, Vanquisher of thousands! flow.

## HYMN LVI. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SWIFT to the purifying sieve flows Soma as exalted Law,
Slaying the fiends, loving the Gods.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  When Soma pours the strengthening food a hundred ever-active streams
To Indra's friendship win theirway.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Ten Dames have sung to welcome thee, even as a maiden greets her love:
O Soma, thou art decked to win.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Flow hitherward, O Indu, sweet to Indra and to Viṣṇu: guard
The men, the singers, from distress.

## HYMN LVII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THY streams that never fail or waste flow forth like showers of rain from heaven,
To bring a thousand stores of strength.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  He flows beholding on his way all wellbeloved sacred lore,
Green-tinted, brandishing his, arms.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He, when the people deck him like a docile king of elephants.
Sits as a falcon in the, wood.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So bring thou hitherward to us, Indu, while thou art purified,
All treasures both of heaven and earth.

## HYMN LVIII. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SWIFT runs this giver of delight, even the stream of flowing juice:
Swift runs this giver of delight.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Morning knows all precious things, the Goddess knows her grace to man:
Swift runs this giver of delight.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  We have accepted thousands from Dhvasra's and Puruṣanti's hands:
Swift runs this giver of delight.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  From whom we have accepted thus thousands and three times ten beside:
Swift runs this giver of delight.

## HYMN LIX. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FLOW onward, Soma, winning kine, and steeds, and all that gives delight:
Bring hither wealth with progeny.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Flow onward from the waters, flow, inviolable, from the plants:
Flow onward from the pressing-boards.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Soma, as Pavamana, pass over all trouble and distress:
Sit on the sacred grass, a Sage.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thou, Pavamana, foundest light; thou at thy birth becamest great:
O Indu, thou art over all.

## HYMN LX. Soma Pavamana.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SING forth and laud with sacred song most active Pavamana, laud
Indu who sees with thousand eyes.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thee who hast thousand eyes to see, bearer of thousand burthens, they
Have filtered through the fleecy cloth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He, Pavamana, hath streamed through the fleece then: he runs into the jars,
Finding his way to Indra's heart.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  That Indra may be bounteous, flow, most active Soma, for our weal:
Bring genial seed with progeny.
