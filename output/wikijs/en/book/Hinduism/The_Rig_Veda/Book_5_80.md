## HYMN LXXI. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Varuṇa and Mitra, ye who slay the foemen, come with might
To this our goodly sacrifice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For, Varuṇa and Mitra, ye Sages are Rulers over all. Fill full our songs, for this ye can.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Come to the juice that we have pressed. Varuṇa, Mitra, come to drink
This Soma of the worshipper.

<span id="h72"></span>

## HYMN LXXII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To Varuṇa and Mitra we offer with songs, as Atri did. Sit on the sacred grass to drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  By Ordinance and Law ye dwell in peace secure, bestirring men.
Sit on the sacred grass to drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  May Varuṇa and Mitra, for our help, accept the sacrifice.
Sit on the sacred grass to drink the Soma juice.

## HYMN LXXIII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHETHER, O Aśvins, ye this day be far remote or near at hand,
In many spots or in mid-air, come hither, Lords of ample wealth.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  These here, who show o’er widest space, bringing full many a wondrous act,
Resistless, lovingly I seek, I call the Mightiest to enjoy.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Another beauteous wheel have ye fixed there to decorate your car.
With others through the realms ye roam in might unto the neighbouring tribes.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  That deed of yours that is extolled, Visvas! hath all been done with this.
Born otherwise, and spotless, ye have entered kinship's bonds with us.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  When Sūrya mounted on your car that rolls for ever rapidly,
Birds of red hue were round about and burning splendours compassed you.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Atri bethinks himself of you, O Heroes, with a friendly mind,
What time, Nāsatyas, with his mouth he stirs the spotless flame for you.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Strong is your swiftly moving steed, famed his exertion in the course
When by your great deeds, Aśvins, Chiefs, Atri is brought to us again.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Lovers of sweetness, Rudras, she who streams with sweetness waits on you.
When ye have travelled through the seas men bring you gifts of well-dressed food.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Aśvins, with truth they call you Twain bestowers of felicity;
At sacrifice most prompt to hear, most gracious ye at sacrifice.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Most pleasing to the Aśvins be these prayers which magnify their might,
Which we have fashioned, even as cars high reverence have we spoken forth.

<span id="h74"></span>

## HYMN LXXIV. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHERE in the heavens are ye to-day, Gods, Aśvins, rich in constancy?
Hear this, ye excellent as Steers: Atri inviteth you to come.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Where are they now? Where are the Twain, the famed Nāsatyas, Gods in heaven?
Who is the man ye strive to reach? Who of your suppliants is with you?
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Whom do ye visit, whom approach? to whom direct your harnessed car?
With whose devotions are ye pleased? We long for you to further us.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Ye, Strengtheners, for Paura stir the filler swimming in the flood,
Advancing to be captured like a lion to the ambuscade.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Ye from cyavana worn with age removed his skin as ’twere a robe.
So, when ye made him young again, he stirred the longing of a dame.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Here is the man who lauds you both: to see your glory are we here.
Now bear me, come with saving help, ye who are rich in store of wealth.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Who among many mortal men this day hath won you to himself?
What bard, accepters of the bard? Who, rich in wealth! with sacrifice?
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Aśvins, may your car approach, most excellent of cars for speed.
Through many regions may our praise pass onward among mortal men.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  May our laudation of you Twain, lovers of meath! be sweet to you.
Fly hitherward, ye wise of heart, like falcons with your winged steeds.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Aśvins, when at any time ye listen to this call of mine,
For you is dainty food prepared: they mix refreshing food for you.

<span id="h75"></span>

## HYMN LXXV. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To meet your treasure-bringing car, the mighty car most dear to us,
Aśvins, the Ṛṣi is prepared, your raiser, with his song of praise. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Pass, O ye Aśvins, pass away beyond all tribes of selfish men,
Wonderful, with your golden paths, most gracious, bringers of the flood. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Come to us, O ye Aśvin Pair, bringing your precious treasures, come
Ye Rudras, on your paths of gold, rejoicing, rich in store of wealth. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  O strong and Good, the voice of him who lauds you well cleaves to your car.
And that great beast, your chariot-steed, fair, wonderful, makes dainty food. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Watchful in spirit, born on cars, impetuous, listing to his cry,
Aśvins, with winged steeds ye speed down to cyavana void of guile. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Hither, O Heroes, let your steeds, of dappled hue, yoked at the thought,
Your flying steeds, O Aśvins, bring you hitherward, with bliss, to drink. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  O Aśvins, hither come to us; Nāsatyas, be not disinclined.
Through longing for the pious turn out of the way to reach our home. Lovers of sweetness, bear my call.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ye Lords of Splendour, free from guile, come, stand at this our sacrifice.
Beside the singer, Aśvins, who longs for your grace and lauds you both. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Dawn with her white herd hath appeared, and in due time hath fire been placed.
Harnessed is your immortal car, O WonderWorkers, strong and kind. Lovers of sweetness, bear my call.

<span id="h76"></span>

## HYMN LXXVI. Aśvins

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AGNI, the bright face of the Dawns, is shining; the singers' pious voices have ascended.
Borne on your chariot, Aśvins, turn you hither and come unto our full and rich libation.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Most frequent guests, they scorn not what is ready: even now the lauded Aśvins are beside us.
With promptest aid they come at morn and evening, the worshipper's most blessed guards from trouble.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Yea, come at milking-time, at early morning, at noon of day and when the Sun is setting,
By day, by night, with favour most auspicious. Not only now the draught hath drawn the Aśvins.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For this place, Aśvins, was of old your dwelling, these were your houses, this your habitation.
Come to us from high heaven and from the mountain. Come from the waters bringing food and vigour.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.
Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy, Immortals!

<span id="h77"></span>

## HYMN LXXVII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  FIRST worship those who come at early morning: let the Twain drink before the giftless niggard.
The Aśvins claim the sacrifice at daybreak: the sages yielding the first share extol them.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Worship at dawn and instigate the Aśvins: nor is the worshipper at eve rejected.
Besides ourselves another craves and worships: each first in worship is most highly favoured.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Covered with gold, meath-tinted, dropping fatness, your chariot with its freight of food comes hither,
Swift as thought, Aśvins, rapid as the tempest, wherewith ye travel over all obstructions.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He who hath served most often the Nāsatyas, and gives the sweetest food at distribution,
Furthers with his own holy works his offspring, and ever passes those whose flames ascend not.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.
Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy, Immortals!

<span id="h78"></span>

## HYMN LXXVIII. Aśvins.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  YE Aśvins, hither come to us: Nāsatyas, be not disinclined.
Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Aśvins, like a pair of deer, like two wild cattle to the mead:
Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Aśvins rich in gifts, accept our sacrifice to prosper it:
Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  As Atri when descending to the cavern called on you loudly like a wailing woman.
Ye came to him, O Aśvins, with the freshest and most auspicious fleetness of a falcon.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Tree, part asunder like the side of her who bringeth forth a child.
Ye Aśvins, listen to my call: loose Saptavadhri from his bonds.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For Saptavadhri, for the seer affrighted when he wept and wailed,
Ye, Aśvins, with your magic powers rent up the tree and shattered it.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Like as the wind on every side ruffles a pool of lotuses,
So stir in thee the babe unborn, so may the ten-month babe descend.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Like as the wind, like as the wood, like as the sea is set astir,
So also, ten-month babe, descend together with the after-birth.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The child who hath for ten months' time been lying in his mother's side,—
May he come forth alive, unharmed, yea, living from the living dame.

<span id="h79"></span>

## HYMN LXXIX. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O HEAVENLY Dawn, awaken us to ample opulence to-day
Even as thou hast wakened us with Satyasravas, Vayya's son, high-born! delightful with thy steeds!
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Daughter of Heaven, thou dawnedst on Sunitha Sucadratha's son,
So dawn thou on one mightier still, on Satyasravas, Vayya's son, high-born! delightful with thy steeds!
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  So, bringing treasure, dawn to-day on us thou Daughter of the Sky,
As thou, O mightier yet. didst shine for Satyatravas, Vayya's son, high-born! delightful with thy steeds!
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Here round about thee are the priests who laud thee, Bright One, with their hymns,
And men with gifts, O Bounteous Dame, splendid with wealth and offering much, high-born! delightful with thy steeds!
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Whatever these thy bands perform to please thee or to win them wealth,
E’en fain they gird us round and give rich gifts which ne’er are reft away, high-born! delightful with thy steeds!
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Give to these wealthy patrons fame, O affluent Dawn, with hero sons,
To these our princes who have brought rich gifts ne’er to be reft away, highborn! delightful with thy steeds!
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Bring lofty and resplendent fame, O thou munificent Dawn, to these
Our wealthy patrons who bestow rich gifts on us of steeds and kine, high-born! delightful with thy steeds!
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Bring us, O Daughter of the Sky, subsistence in our herds of kine,
Together with the sunbeams, with the shine of pure refulgent flames, highborn! delightful with thy steeds!
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Daughter of the Sky, shine forth; delay not to perform thy task.
Let not the Sun with fervent heat consume thee like a robber foe, high-born! delightful with the steeds!
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  So much, and more exceedingly, O Dawn, it suits thee to bestow,
Thou Radiant One who ceasest not to shine for those who sing thy praise, highborn! delightful with thy steeds!

<span id="h80"></span>

## HYMN LXXX. Dawn.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE singers welcome with their hymns and praises the Goddess Dawn who bringeth in the sunlight,
Sublime, by Law true to eternal Order, bright on her path, red-tinted, far-refulgent.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  She comes in front, fair, rousing up the people, making the pathways easy to be travelled.
High, on her lofty chariot, all-impelling, Dawn gives her splendour at the days' beginning.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  She, harnessing her car with purple oxen. injuring none, hath brought perpetual riches.
Opening paths to happiness, the Goddess shines, praised by all, giver of every blessing.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  With changing tints she gleams in double splendour while from the eastward she displays her body.
She travels perfectly the path of Order, nor fails to reach, as one who knows, the quarters.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  As conscious that her limbs are bright with bathing, she stands, as ’twere, erect that we may see her.
Driving away malignity and darkness, Dawn, Child of Heaven, hath come to us with lustre.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The Daughter of the Sky, like some chaste woman, bends, opposite to men, her forehead downward.
The Maid, disclosing boons to him who worships, hath brought again the daylight as aforetime.
