## HYMN LI. Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THAT mighty eye of Varuṇa and Mitra, infallible and dear, is moving upward.
The pure and lovely face of holy Order hath shone like gold of heaven in its arising.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Sage who knows these Gods’ three ranks and orders, and all their generations near and distant,
Beholding good and evil acts of mortals, Sūra marks well the doing of the pious.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I praise you Guards of mighty Law eternal, Aditi, Mitra, Varuṇa, the noble,
Aryaman, Bhaga, all whose thoughts are faithful: hither I call the Bright who share in common.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Lords of the brave, infallible, foe-destroyers, great Kings, bestowers of fair homes to dwell in,
Young, Heroes, ruling heaven with strong dominion, Ādityas, Aditi I seek with worship.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  O Heaven our Father, Earth our guileless Mother, O Brother Agni, and ye Vasus, bless us.
Grant us, O Aditi and ye Ādityas, all of one mind, your manifold protection.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Give us not up to any evil creature, as spoil to wolf or she-wolf, O ye Holy.
For ye are they who guide aright our bodies, ye are the rulers of our speech and vigour.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let us not suffer for the sin of others, nor do the deed which ye, O Vasus, punish.
Ye, Universal Gods! are all-controllers: may he do harm unto himself who hates Me.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Mighty is homage: I adopt and use it. Homage hath held in place the earth and heaven.
Homage to Gods! Homage commands and rules them. I banish even committed sin by homage
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  You Furtherers of Law, pure in your spirit, infallible, dwellers in the home of Order,
To you all Heroes mighty and far-seeing I bow me down, O Holy Ones, with homage.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  For these are they who shine with noblest splendour; through all our troubles these conduct us safely-
Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, mighty Rulers, trueminded, faithful to the hymn's controllers.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  May they, Earth, Aditi, Indra, Bhaga, Pūṣan increase our laud, increase the Fivefold people.
Giving good help, good refuge, goodly guidance, be they our good deliverers, good protectors.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Come now, O Gods, to your celestial station: the Bharadvājas' priest entreats your favour.
He, sacrificing, fain for wealth, hath honoured the Gods vath those who sit and share oblations.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Agni, drive thou the wicked foe, the evil-hearted thief away,
Far, far, Lord of the brave I and give us easy paths.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Soma, these pressing-stones have called aloud to win thee for our Friend.
Destroy the greedy Paṇi, for a wolf is he.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Ye, O most bountiful, are they who, led by Indra, seek the sky.
Give us good paths for travel: guard us ivell at home.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Now have we entered on the road that leads to bliss, without a foe,
The road whereon a man escapes all enemies and gathers wealth.

<span id="h52"></span>

## HYMN LII Viśvedevas.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THIS I allow not in the earth or heaven, at sacrifice or in these holy duties.
May the huge mountains crush him down: degraded be Atiyaja's sacrificing patron.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Or he who holds us in contempt, O Maruts, or seeks to blame the prayer that we are making,
May agonies of burning be his portion. May the sky scorch the man who hates devotion.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Why then, O Soma, do they call thee keeper of prayer? Why then our guardian from reproaches?
Why then beholdest thou how men revile us? Cast thy hot dart at him who hates devotion.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  May Mornings as they spring to life, protect me, and may the Rivers as they swell preserve me.
My guardians be the firmly-seated mountains: the Fathers, when I call on Gods, defend me!
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Through all our days may we be healthy. minded, and look upon the Sun when he arises.
Grant this the Treasure-Lord of treasures, coming, observant, oftenest of Gods, with succour!
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Most near, most oft comes Indra with protection, and she Sarasvatī, who swells with rivers -
Parjanya, bringing health with herbs, and Agni, well lauded swift to listen, like a father.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Hear this mine invocation; come hither, O Universal Gods,
Be seated on this holy grass.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  To him who comes to meet you, Gods, with offerings bathed in holy oil-
Approach ye, one and all, to him.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  All Sons of Immortality shall listen to the songs we sing,
And be exceeding good to us.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  May all the Gods who strengthen Law, with Ṛtus, listening to our call,
Be pleased with theit appropriate draught.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  May Indra, with the Marut host, with Tvaṣṭar, Mitra, Aryaman,
Accept the laud and these our gifts.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  O Agni, Priest, as rules ordain, offer this sacrifice of ours,
Remembering the Heavenly Folk.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Listen, All-Gods, to this mine invocation, Ye who inhabit heaven, and air's midregions,
All ye, O Holy Ones, whose tongue is Agni, seated upon this sacred grass, be joyful.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  May the All-Gods who claim our worship hear my thought; may the two World-halves hear it, and the Waters’ Child.
Let me not utter words that ye may disregard. Closely allied with you may we rejoice in bliss.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And those who, Mighty, with the wiles of serpents, were born on earth, in heaven, where waters gather-
May they vouchsafe us life of full duration. May the Gods kindly give us nights and mornings.
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  At this my call, O Agni and Parjanya, help, swift to hear, my thought and our laudation.
One generates holy food, the other offspring, so grant us food enough with store of children.
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  When holy grass is strewn and fire enkindled, with hymn and lowly homage I invite you.
All-Gods, to day in this our great assembly rejoice, ye Holy, in the gifts we offer.

## HYMN LIII. Pūṣan.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LORD of the path, O Pūṣan, we have yoked and bound thee to our hymn,
Even as a car, to win the prize.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Bring us the wealth that men require, a manly master of a house,
Free-handed with the liberal meed.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Even him who would not give, do thou,
O glowing Pūṣan, urge to give,
And make the niggard's soul grow soft.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Clear paths that we may win the prize; scatter our enemies afar.
Strong God, be all our thoughts fulfilled.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Penetrate with an awl, O Sage, the hearts of avaricious churls,
And make them subject to our will.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thrust with thine awl, O Pūṣan: seek that which the niggard's heart holds dear,
And make him subject to our will.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Tear up and read in pieces, Sage, the hearts of avaricious churls,
And make them subject to our will.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thou, glowing Pūṣan, carriest an awl that urges men to prayer;
Therewith do thou tear up and rend to shreds the heart of every one.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou bearest, glowing Lord! a goad with horny point that guides the cows
Thence do we seek thy gift of bliss.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And make this hymn of ours produce kine, horses, and a store of wealth
For our delight and use as men.

<span id="h54"></span>

## HYMN LIV. Pūṣan.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O PUSAN, bring us to the man who knows, who shall direct us straight,
And say unto us, It is here.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  May we go forth with Pūṣan who shall point the houses out to us,
And say to us, These same are they.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Unharmed is Pūṣan's chariot wheel; the box ne’er falleth to the ground,
Nor doth the loosened felIy shake.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Pūṣan forgetteth not the man who serveth him with offered gift:
That man is first to gather wealth.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  May Pūṣan follow near our kine; may Pūṣan keep our horses safe:
May Pūṣan gather gear for us.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Follow the kine of him who pours libations out and worships thee;
And ours who sing thee songs of praise.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Let none be lost, none injured, none sink in a pit and break a limb.
Return with these all safe and sound.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Pūṣan who listens to our prayers, the Strong whose wealth is never lost,
The Lord of riches, we implore.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Secure in thy protecting care, O Pūṣan, never may we fail.
We here are they who sing thy praise.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  From out the distance, far and wide, may Pūṣan stretch his right hand forth,
And drive our lost again to us.

<span id="h55"></span>

## HYMN LV. Pūṣan.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  SON of Deliverance, come, bright God!
Let us twain go together: be our charioteer of sacrifice.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  We pray for wealth to thee most skilled of charioteers, with braided hair,
Lord of great riches, and our Friend.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bright God whose steeds are goats, thou art a stream of wealth, a treasure-heap,
The Friend of every pious man.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Pūṣan, who driveth goats for steeds, the strong and Mighty, who is called
His Sister's lover, will we laud.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  His Mother's suitor I address. May he who loves his Sister hear,
Brother of Indra, and my Friend.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  May the sure-footed goats come nigh, conveying Pūṣan on his car,
The God who visiteth mankind.

<span id="h56"></span>

## HYMN LVI, Pūṣan.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WHOSO remembers Pūṣan as cater of mingled curd and meal
Need think no more upon the God.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he is best of charioteers. Indra, the hero's Lord, allied
With him as Friend, destroys the foes.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And there the best of charioteers hath guided through the speckled cloud
The golden wheel of Sūra's car.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Whate’er we speak this day to thee, Wise, Wondrous God whom many praise,
Give thou fulfilment of our thought.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Lead on this company of ours, that longs for kine, to win the spoil:
Thou, Pūṣan, art renowned afar.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Prosperity we crave from thee, afar from sin and near to wealth,
Tending to perfect happiness both for to. morrow and to-day.

<span id="h57"></span>

## HYMN LVII. Indra and Pūṣan.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  INDRA and Pūṣan will we call for friend ship and prosperity
And for the winning of the spoil.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  One by the Soma sits to drink juice which the mortar hath expressed:
The other longs for curd and meal.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Goats are the team that draws the one: the other hath Bay Steeds at hand;
With both of these he slays the fiends.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  When Indra, wondrous strong, brought down the streams, the mighty waterfloods,
Pūṣan was standing by his side.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  To this, to Pūṣan's favouring love, and Indra's, may we closely cling,
As to a tree's extended bough.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  As one who drives a car draws in his reins, may we draw Pūṣan near,
And Indra, for our great success.

<span id="h58"></span>

## HYMN LVIII. Pūṣan.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  LIKE heaven art thou: one form is bright, one holy, like Day and Night dissimilar in colour.
All magic powers thou aidest, self-depen. dent! Auspicious be thy bounty here, O Pūṣan.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Goat-borne, the guard of cattle, he whose home is strength, inspirer of the hymn, set over all the world;
Brandishing here and there his lightly. moving goad, beholding every creature, Pūṣan, God, goes forth.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Pūṣan, with thy golden ships that travel across the ocean, in the air's mid-region,
Thou goest on an embassy to Sūrya, subdued by love, desirous of the glory.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Near kinsman of the heaven and earth is Pūṣan, liberal, Lord of food, of wondrous iustre,
Whom strong and vigorous and swiftlymoving, subdued by love, the Deities gave to Sūrya.

<span id="h59"></span>

## HYMN LIX. Indra-Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I WILL declare, while juices flow, the manly deeds that ye have done:
Your Fathers, enemies of Gods, were smitten down, and, Indra-Agni, ye survive.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thus, Indra-Agnip verily your greatness merits loftiest praise,
Sprung from one common Father, brothers, twins are ye; your Mother is in every place.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  These who delight in flowing juice, like fellow horses at their food,
Indra and Agni, Gods armed with the thunderbolt, we call this day to come with help.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, Friends of Law, served with rich gifts, your speech is kind
To him who praises you while these libations flow: that man, O Gods, ye ne’er consume.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  What mortal understands, O Gods, Indra and Agni, this your way?
One of you, yoking Steeds that move to every side, advances in your common car.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  First, Indra-Agni, hath this Maid come footless unto those with feet.
Stretching her head and speaking loudly with her tongue, she hath gone downward thirty steps.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  E’en now, O Indra-Agni, men hold in their arms and stretch their bows.
Desert us not in this great fray, in battles for the sake of kine.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The foeman's sinful enmities, Indra and Agni, vex me sore.
Drive those who hate me far away, and keep them distant from the Sun.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, yours are all the treasures of the heavens and earth.
Here give ye us the opulence that prospers every living man.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  O Indra-Agni, who accept the laud, and hear us for our praise,
Come near us, drawn by all our songs, to drink of this our Soma juice.

<span id="h60"></span>

## HYMN LX. Indra-Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  HE slays the foe and wins the spoil who worships Indra and Agni, strong and mighty Heroes,
Who rule as Sovrans over ample riches, victorious, showing forth their power in conquest.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  So battle now, O Indra and thou, Agni, for cows and waters, sunlight, stolen Mornings.
Team-borne, thou makest kine thine own, O Agni: thou, Indra, light, Dawns, regions, wondrous waters.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  With Vṛtra-slaying might, Indra and Agni, come, drawn by homage, O ye Vṛtra-slayers.
Indra and Agni, show yourselves among us with your supreme and unrestricted bounties.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I call the Twain whose deeds of old have all been famed in ancient days
O Indra-Agni, harm us not.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The Strong, the scatterers of the foe, Indra and Agni, we invoke;
May they be kind to one like me.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  They slay our Ārya foes, these Lords of heroes, slay our Dasyu foes
And drive our enemies away.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, these our songs of praise have sounded forth to you:
Ye who bring blessings! drink the juice.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Come, Indra-Agni, with those teams, desired of many, which ye have,
O Heroes, for the worshipper.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  With those to this libation poured, ye Heroes, Indra-Agni, come:
Come ye to drink the Soma juice.
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Glorify him who compasses all forests with his glowing flame,
And leaves them blackened with his tongue.
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He who gains Indra's bliss with fire enkindled finds an easy way
Over the floods to happiness.
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Give us fleet coursers to convey Indra and Agni, and bestow
Abundant strengthening food on us.
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, I will call you hither and make you joyful with the gifts I offer.
Ye Twain are givers both of food and riches: to win me strength and vigour I invoke you.
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Come unto us with riches, come with wealth in horses and in kine.
Indra and Agni, we invoke you both, the Gods, as Friends for friendship, bringing bliss.
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, hear his call who worships. with libations poured.
Come and enjoy the offerings, drink the sweetly-flavoured Soma juice.
