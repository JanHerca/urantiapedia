## HYMN Xl. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AGNI is Priest, the great High Priest of sacrifice, most swift in act:
He knows the rite in constant course.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Oblation-bearer, deathless, well inclined, an eager messenger,
Agni comes nigh us with the thought.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Ensign of sacrifice from of old, Agni well knoweth with his thought
To prosper this man's aim and hope.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni, illustrious from old time, the Son of Strength who knows all life,
The Gods have made to their Priest.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Infallible is Agni, he who goes before the tribes of men,
A chariot swift and ever new.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Strength of the Gods which none may harm, subduing all his enemies,
Agni is mightiest in fame.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  By offering sacred food to him the mortal worshipper obtains.
A home from him whose light makes pure.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  From Agni, by our hymns, may we gain all things that bring happiness,
Singers of him who knows all life.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  O Agni, in our deeds of might may we obtain all precious things:
Tle Gods are centred all in thee.

<span id="h12"></span>

## HYMN XII. Indra-Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  MOVED, Indra-Agni, by our hymn, come to the juice, the precious dew:
Drink ye thereof, impelled by song.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  O Indra-Agni, with the man who lauds you comes the wakening rite:
So drink ye both this juice assured.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Through force of sacrifice I choose Indra-Agni who love the wise:
With Soma let these sate them here.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Indra and Agni I invoke, joint-victors, bounteous, unsubdued,
Foe-slayers, best to win the spoil.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, singers skilled in melody hymn you, bringing lauds:
I choose you for the sacred food.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, ye cast down the ninety forts which Dāsas held,
Together, with one mighty deed.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  To Indra-Agni reverent thoughts go forward from the holy task
Along the path of sacred Law.
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  O Indra-Agni, powers are yours, and dwellings and delightful food
Good is your readiness to act.
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Indra and Agni, in your deeds of might ye deck heaven's lucid realms:
Famed is that hero strength of yours.

<span id="h13"></span>

## HYMN XIII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  To Agni, to this God of yours I sing aloud with utmost power.
May he come to us with the Gods, and sit, best Offerer, on the grass.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  The Holy, whose are earth and heaven, and succour waits upon his strength;
Him men who bring oblations laud, and they who wish to gain, for grace.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  He is the Sage who guides these men, Leader of sacred rites is he.
Him your own Agni, serve ye well, who winneth and bestoweth wealth.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  So may the gracious Agni grant most goodly shelter for our use;
Whence in the heavens or in the floods he shall pour wealth upon our lands.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The singers kindle him, the Priest, Agni the Lord of tribes of men,
Resplendent and without a peer through his own excellent designs.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Help us, thou Brahman, best of all invokers of the Gods in song.
Beam, Friend of Maruts, bliss on us, O Agni, a most liberal God.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yea, grant us treasure thousandfold with children and with nourishment,
And, Agni, splendid hero strength, exalted, wasting not away.

<span id="h14"></span>

## HYMN XIV. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THE pleasant Priest is come into the synod, true, skilled in sacrifice, most wise, Ordainer.
Agni, the Son of Strength, whose car is lightning, whose hair is flame, hath shown on earth his lustre.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  To thee I offer reverent speech: accept it: to thee who markest it, victorious, faithful!
Bring, thou who knowest, those who know, and seat thee amid the sacred grass, for help, O Holy.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  The Two who show their vigour, Night and Morning, by the wind's paths shall haste to thee O Agni.
When men adorn the Ancient with oblations, these seek, as on two chariot-seats, the dwelling.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  To thee, strong Agni! Varuṇa and Mitra and all the Maruts sang a song of triumph,
What time unto the people's lands thou camest, spreading them as the Sun of men, with lustre.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Approaching with raised hands and adoration, we have this day fulfilled for thee thy longing.
Worship the Gods with most devoted spirit, a Priest with no unfriendly thought, O Agni.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For, Son of Strength, from thee come many succours, and powers abundant that a God possesses.
Agni, to us with speech that hath no falsehood grant riches, real, to be told in thousands.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Whatever, God, in sacrifice we mortals have wrought is all for thee, strong, wise of purpose!
Be thou the Friend of each good chariot's master. All this enjoy thou here, immortal Agni.

<span id="h15"></span>

## HYMN XV. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  RESPLENDENT with thy wide-extending lustre, dispel the terrors of the fiends who hate us
May lofty Agni be my guide and shelter, the easily-invoked, the good Protector.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Be thou To us, while now the morn is breaking, be thou a guardian when the Sun hath mounted..
Accept, as men accept a true-born infant, my laud, O Agni nobly born in body.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Bull, who beholdest men, through many mornings, among the dark ones shine forth red, O Agni.
Lead us, good Lord, and bear us over trouble: Help us who long, Most Youthful God, to riches.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Shine forth, a Bull invincible, O Agni, winning by conquest all the forts and treasures,
Thou Jātavedas who art skilled in guiding, the chief high saving sacrifice's Leader.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Lighting Gods hither, Agni, wisest Singer, bring thou to us many and flawless shelters.
Bring vigour, like a car that gathers booty: bring us, O Agni, beauteous Earth and Heaven.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Swell, O thou Bull and give those powers an impulse, e’en Earth and Heaven who yield their milk in plenty,
Shining, O God, with Gods in clear effulgence. Let not a mortal's evil will obstruct us.
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Agni, as holy food to thine invoker, give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels.
To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will to us-ward.

<span id="h16"></span>

## HYMN XVI. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  THIS Agni is the Lord of great felicity and hero Strength;
Lord of wealth in herds of kine; Lord of the battles with the foe.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Wait, Maruts, Heroes, upon him the Prosperer in whom is bliss-increasing wealth;
Who in fights ever conquer evil-hearted men, who overcome the enemy.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  As such, O Agni, deal us wealth and hero might, O Bounteous One!
Most lofty, very glorious, rich in progeny, free from disease and full of power.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  He who made all that lives, who passes all in might, who orders service to the Gods,
He works among the Gods, he works in hero strength, yea, also in the praise of men.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Give us not up to indigence, Agni, nor want of hero sons,
Nor, Son of Strength, to lack of cattle, nor to blame. Drive. thou our enemies away.
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Help us to strength, blest Agni! rich in progeny, abundant, in our sacrifice.
Flood us with riches yet more plenteous, bringing weal, with high renown, most Glorious One!

<span id="h17"></span>

## HYMN XVII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  DULY enkindled after ancient customs, bringing all treasures, he is balmed with unguents,—
Flame-haired, oil-clad, the purifying Agni, skilled in fair rites, to bring the Gods for worship.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  As thou, O Agni, skilful Jātavedas, hast sacrificed as Priest of Earth, of Heaven,
So with this offering bring the Gods, and prosper this sacrifice today as erst for Manu.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Three are thy times of life, O Jātavedas, and the three mornings are thy births, O Agni.
With these, well-knowing, grant the Gods’ kind favour, and help in stir and stress the man who worships.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni most bright and fair with song we honour, yea, the adorable, O Jātavedas.
Thee, envoy, messenger, oblation-bearer, the Gods have made centre of life eternal.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  That Priest before thee, yet more skilled in worship, stablished of old, health-giver by his nature,—
After his custom offer, thou who knowest, and lay our sacrifice where Gods may taste it.

<span id="h18"></span>

## HYMN XVIII. Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  AGNI, be kind to us when we approach thee good as a friend to friend, as sire and mother.
The races of mankind are great oppressors burn up malignity that strives against us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Agni, burn up the unfriendly who are near us, burn thou the foeman's curse who pays no worship.
Burn, Vasu, thou who markest well, the foolish: let thine eternal nimble beams surround thee.

With prayer, so far as I have power, adoring-this hymn divine to gain a hundred treasures.
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Give with thy glow, thou Son of Strength, when lauded, great vital power to those who toil to serve thee.

In our Gods’ service he, best skilled, shall worship: may he obtain us boons for strength and riches.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Agni, to thee I lift the oil-fed ladle, bright, with an offering, bearing our oblation.

In power of wealth most rich in men. O Agni, of thee, the Good, may we sing forth fair praises.

## HYMN XX Agni.

<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  WITH lauds at break of morn the priest invoketh Agni, Dawn, Dadhikrās, and both the Aśvins.
With one consent the Gods whose light is splendid, longing to taste our sacrifice, shall hear us.
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Three are thy powers, O Agni, three thy stations, three are thy tongues, yea, many, Child of Order!
Three bodies hast thou which the Gods delight in: with these protect our hymns with care unceasing.
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  O Agni, many are the names thou bearest, immortal, God, Divine, and Jātavedas.
And many charms of charmers, All-Inspirer! have they laid in thee, Lord of true attendants!
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Agni, like Bhaga, leads the godly people, he who is true to Law and guards the seasons.
Ancient, all-knowing, he the Vṛtra-slayer shall bear the singer safe through every trouble.
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I call on Savitar the God, on Morning, Bṛhaspati, and Dadhikrās, and Agni,
On Varuṇa and Mitra, on the Aśvins, Bhaga, the Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas.
