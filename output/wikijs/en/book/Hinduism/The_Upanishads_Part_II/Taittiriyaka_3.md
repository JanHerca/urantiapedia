THIRD VALLÎ, OR, THE CHAPTER OF BH<i>RI</i>GU.

Hari<i>h</i>, Om! May it (the Brahman) protect us both! May it enjoy us both! May we acquire strength together! May our knowledge become bright! May we never quarrel! Peace! peace! peace [^235]!

## FIRST ANUVÂKA.

Bh<i>ri</i>gu Vâru<i>n</i>i went to his father Varu<i>n</i>a, saying:

Sir, teach me Brahman.' He told him this, viz. Food, breath, the eye, the ear, mind, speech.

Then he said again to him: ‘That from whence these beings are born, that by which, when born, they live, that into which they enter at their death, try to know that. That is Brahman.’

He performed penance. Having performed penance—


## SECOND ANUVÂKA.

He perceived that food is Brahman, for from food these beings are produced; by food, when born, they live; and into food they enter at their death.

Having perceived this, he went again to his father Varu<i>n</i>a, saying: ‘Sir, teach me Brahman.’ He said to him: ‘Try to know Brahman by penance, for penance is (the means of knowing) Brahman.’

He performed penance. Having performed penance—

<span id="p65">[<sup><small>p. 65</small></sup>]</span>

## THIRD ANUVÂKA.

He perceived that breath [^236] is Brahman, for from breath these beings are born; by breath, when born, they live; into breath they enter at their death.

Having perceived this, he went again to his father Varu<i>n</i>a, saying: ‘Sir, teach me Brahman.’ He said to him: ‘Try to know Brahman by penance, for penance is (the means of knowing) Brahman.’

He performed penance. Having performed penance—


## FOURTH ANUVÂKA.

He perceived that mind (manas) is Brahman, for from mind these beings are born; by mind, when born, they live; into mind they enter at their death.

Having perceived this, he went again to his father Varu<i>n</i>a, saying: ‘Sir, teach me Brahman.’ He said to him: ‘Try to know Brahman by penance, for penance is (the means of knowing) Brahman.’

He performed penance. Having performed penance—

## FIFTH ANUVÂKA.

He perceived that understanding (vi<i>g</i>_ñ_âna) was Brahman, for from understanding these beings are born; by understanding, when born, they live; into understanding they enter at their death.

Having perceived this, he went again to his father Varu<i>n</i>a, saying—‘Sir, teach me Brahman.’ He said to him: ‘Try to know Brahman by penance, for penance is (the means of knowing) Brahman.’

<span id="p66">[<sup><small>p. 66</small></sup>]</span>

He performed penance. Having performed penance—

## SIXTH ANUVÂKA.

He perceived that bliss is Brahman, for from bliss these beings are born; by bliss, when born, they live; into bliss they enter at their death.

This is the knowledge of Bh<i>ri</i>gu and Varu<i>n</i>a [1](Taittiriyaka_3#fn237), exalted in the highest heaven (in the heart). He who knows this becomes exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to eat food (healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle, and the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman), great by fame.

## SEVENTH ANUVÂKA.

Let him never abuse food, that is the rule.

Breath is food [2](Taittiriyaka_3#fn238), the body eats the food. The body rests on breath, breath rests on the body. This is the food resting on food. He who knows this food resting on food [3](Taittiriyaka_3#fn239), rests exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to cat food (healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle, and the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman), great by fame.

## EIGHTH ANUVÂKA.

Let him never shun food, that is the rule. Water is food, the light eats the food. The light rests on water, water rests on light. This is the food resting <span id="p67">[<sup><small>p. 67</small></sup>]</span> on food [^240]. He who knows this food resting on food, rests exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to eat food (healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle, and the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman), great by fame.


## NINTH ANUVÂKA.

Let him acquire much food, that is the rule. Earth is food, the ether eats the food. The ether rests on the earth, the earth rests on the ether. This is the food resting on food. He who knows this food resting on food, rests exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to eat food (healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle, and the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman), great by fame.

## TENTH ANUVÂKA.

1\. Let him never turn away (a stranger) from his house, that is the rule. Therefore a man should by all means acquire much food, for (good) people say (to the stranger): ‘There is food ready for him.’ If he gives food amply, food is given to him amply. If he gives food fairly, food is given to him fairly. If he gives food meanly, food is given to him meanly.

2\. He who knows this, (recognises and worships Brahman [^241]) as possession in speech, as acquisition and possession in up-breathing (prâ<i>n</i>a) and down-breathing (apâna); as action in the hands; as walking in the feet; as voiding in the anus. These are the human recognitions (of Brahman as manifested in human actions). Next follow the recognitions (of <span id="p68">[<sup><small>p. 68</small></sup>]</span> Brahman) with reference to the Devas, viz. as satisfaction in rain; as power in lightning;

3\. As glory in cattle; as light in the stars; as procreation, immortality, and bliss in the member; as everything in the ether. Let him worship that (Brahman) as support, and he becomes supported. Let him worship that (Brahman) as greatness (maha<i>h</i>), and he becomes great. Let him worship that (Brahman) as mind, and he becomes endowed with mind.

4\. Let him worship that (Brahman) as adoration, and all desires fall down before him in adoration. Let him worship that (Brahman) as Brahman, and he will become possessed of Brahman. Let him worship this as the absorption of the gods [^242] in Brahman, and the enemies who hate him will die all around him, all around him will die the foes whom he does not love.

He [^243] who is this (Brahman) in man, and he who is that (Brahman) in the sun, both are one.

5\. He who knows this, when he has departed this world, after reaching and comprehending the Self which consists of food, the Self which consists of breath, the Self which consists of mind, the Self which consists of understanding, the Self which consists of bliss, enters and takes possession of these worlds, and having as much food as he likes, and assuming as many forms as he likes, he sits down singing this Sâman (of Brahman): 'Hâvu, hâvu, hâvu! <span id="p69">[<sup><small>p. 69</small></sup>]</span> 6\. 'I am food (object), I am food, I am food! I am the eater of food (subject), I am the eater of food, I am the eater of food! I am the poet (who joins the two together), I am the poet, I am the poet! I am the first-born of the Right (<i>ri</i>ta). Before the Devas I was in the centre of all that is immortal. He who gives me away, he alone preserves me: him who eats food, I eat as food.

‘I overcome the whole world, I, endowed with golden light [^244]. He who knows this, (attains all this).’ This is the Upanishad [^245].

## Footnotes

[^235]: 64:1 The same paragraph, as before (II, 1), occurs at the end of the Ka<i>th</i>a-upanishad, and elsewhere.

[^236]: 65:1 Or life; see B<i>ri</i>h. Âr. Up. IV, 1, 3.

[^237]: 66:1 Taught by Varu<i>n</i>a, learnt by Bh<i>ri</i>gu Vâru<i>n</i>i.

[^238]: 66:2 Because, like food, it is inside the body.

[^239]: 66:3 The interdependence of food and breath. The object of this discussion is to show (see <i>S</i>aṅkara's commentary, p. 135) that the world owes its origin to there being an enjoyer (subject) and what is enjoyed (object), but that this distinction does not exist in the Self.

[^240]: 67:1 The interdependence of water and light.

[^241]: 67:2 Brâhma<i>n</i>a upâsanaprakâtra<i>h</i>.

[^242]: 68:1 Cf. Kaush. Up. II, 12. Here the absorption of the gods of fire, sun, moon, and lightning in the god of the air (vâyu) is described. <i>S</i>aṅkara adds the god of rain, and shows that air is identical with ether.

[^243]: 68:2 Cf. II, 8.

[^244]: 69:1 If we read suvar<i>n</i>a<i>g</i>yoti<i>h</i>. The commentator reads suvar <i>n</i>a <i>g</i>yoti<i>h</i>. i.e. the light is like the sun.

[^245]: 69:2 After the Anukramanî follows the same invocation as in the beginning of the third Vallî, ‘May it protect us both,’ &c.
