## SECOND ADHYÂYA.

1 [^728]. Savit<i>ri</i> (the sun), having first collected his mind and expanded his thoughts, brought Agni (fire), when he had discovered his light, above the earth.

2 [^729]. With collected minds we are at the command of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, that we may obtain blessedness. <span id="p239">[<sup><small>p. 239</small></sup>]</span> 3 [^730]. May Savit<i>ri</i>, after he has reached with his mind the gods as they rise up to the sky, and with his thoughts (has reached) heaven, grant these gods to make a great light to shine.

4 [^731]. The wise sages of the great sage collect their mind and collect their thoughts. He who alone knows the law (Savit<i>ri</i>) has ordered the invocations; great is the praise of the divine Savit<i>ri</i>. <span id="p240">[<sup><small>p. 240</small></sup>]</span> 5 [^732]. Your old prayer has to be joined [^733] with praises. Let my song go forth like the path of the sun! May all the sons of the Immortal listen, they who have reached their heavenly homes.

6\. Where the fire is rubbed [^734], where the wind is checked, where the Soma flows over, there the mind is born. <span id="p241">[<sup><small>p. 241</small></sup>]</span> 7\. Let us love the old Brahman by the grace of Savit<i>ri</i>; if thou make thy dwelling there, the path will not hurt thee [^735].

8\. If a wise man hold his body with its three erect parts (chest, neck, and head) even [^736], and turn his senses with the mind towards the heart, he will then in the boat of Brahman [^737] cross all the torrents which cause fear.

9\. Compressing his breathings let him, who has subdued all motions, breathe forth through the nose with gentle breath [^738]. Let the wise man without fail restrain his mind, that chariot yoked with vicious horses [^739].

10\. Let him perform his exercises in a place [^740] <span id="p242">[<sup><small>p. 242</small></sup>]</span> level, pure, free from pebbles, fire, and dust, delightful by its sounds, its water, and bowers, not painful to the eye, and full of shelters and caves.

11\. When Yoga is being performed, the forms which come first, producing apparitions in Brahman, are those of misty smoke, sun, fire, wind, fire-flies, lightnings, and a crystal moon [^741].

12\. When, as earth, water, light, heat, and ether arise, the fivefold quality of Yoga takes place [^742], then there is no longer illness, old age, or pain [^743] for him who has obtained a body, produced by the fire of Yoga.

13\. The first results of Yoga they call lightness, healthiness, steadiness, a good complexion, an easy pronunciation, a sweet odour, and slight excretions.

14\. As a metal disk (mirror), tarnished by dust, shines bright again after it has been cleaned, so is the one incarnate person satisfied and free from grief, after he has seen the real nature of the Self [^744]. <span id="p243">[<sup><small>p. 243</small></sup>]</span> 15\. And when by means of the real nature of his self he sees, as by a lamp, the real nature of Brahman, then having known the unborn, eternal god, who is beyond all natures [^745], he is freed from all fetters.

16\. He indeed is the god who pervades all regions: he is the first-born (as Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha), and he is in the womb. He has been born, and he will be born [^746]. He stands behind all persons, looking everywhere.

17\. The god [^747] who is in the fire, the god who is in the water, the god who has entered into the whole world, the god who is in plants, the god who is in trees, adoration be to that god, adoration!

## Footnotes

[^730]: 238:1 The seven introductory verses are taken from hymns addressed to Savit<i>ri</i> as the rising sun. They have been so twisted by <i>S</i>aṅkara, in order to make them applicable to the teachings of the Yoga philosophy, as to become almost nonsensical. I have given a few specimens of <i>S</i>aṅkara's renderings in the notes, but have translated the verses, as much as possible, in their original character. As they are merely introductory, I do not understand why the collector of the Upanishad should have seen in them anything but an invocation of Savit<i>ri</i>.

These verses are taken from various Sa<i>m</i>hitâs. The first yu_ñ_<i>g</i>âna<i>h</i> prathamam is from Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 1; Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XI, 1; see also <i>S</i>at. Br. VI, 3, 1, 12. The Taittirîya-text agrees with the Upanishad, the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-text has dhiyam for dhiya<i>h</i>, and agne<i>h</i> for agnim. Both texts take tatvâya as a participle of tan, while the Upanishad reads tattvâya, as a dative of tattva, truth. I have translated the verse in its natural sense. <i>S</i>aṅkara, in explaining the Upanishad, translates: ‘At the beginning of our meditation, joining the mind with the Highest Self, also the other prâ<i>n</i>as, or the knowledge of outward things, for the sake of truth, Savit<i>ri</i>, out of the knowledge of outward things, brought Agni, after having discovered his brightness, above the earth, in this body.’ He explains it: ‘May Savit<i>ri</i>, taking our thoughts away from outward things, in order to concentrate them on the Highest Self, produce in our speech and in our other senses that power which can lighten all objects, which proceeds from Agni and from the other favourable deities.’ He adds that ‘by the favour of Savit<i>ri</i>, Yoga may be obtained.’

[^731]: 238:2 The second verse is from Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 3; Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XI, 2. The Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-text has svargyâya for svargeyâya, and <i>s</i>aktyâ for <i>s</i>aktyai. <i>S</i>aṅkara explains: ‘With a mind that has been joined p. 239 by Savit<i>ri</i> to the Highest Self, we, with the sanction of that Savit<i>ri</i>, devote ourselves to the work of meditation, which leads to the obtainment of Svarga, according to our power.’ He explains Svarga by Paramâtman. Sâya<i>n</i>a in his commentary on the Taittirîya-sa<i>m</i>hitâ explains svargeyâya by svargaloke gîyamânasyâgne<i>h</i> sampâdanâya; <i>S</i>aṅkara, by svargaprâptihetubhûtâya dhyânakarma<i>n</i>e. <i>S</i>aktyai is explained by <i>S</i>aṅkara by yathâsâmarthyam; by Sâya<i>n</i>a, by <i>s</i>aktâ bhûyâsma. Mahîdhara explains <i>s</i>aktyâ by svasâmarthyena. I believe that the original reading was svargyâya <i>s</i>aktyai, and that we must take <i>s</i>aktyai as an infinitive, like ityai, construed with a dative, like d<i>ri</i>saye sûryâya, for the seeing of the sun. The two attracted datives would be governed by save, ‘we are under the command of Savit<i>ri</i>,’ svargyâya <i>s</i>aktyai, ‘that we may obtain svargya, life in Svarga or blessedness.’

[^732]: 239:1 The third verse is from Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 2; Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XI, 3. The Taittirîyas read yuktvâya manasâ; the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins, yuktvâya savitâ. <i>S</i>aṅkara translates: ‘Again he prays that Savit<i>ri</i>, having directed the devas, i.e. the senses, which are moving towards Brahman, and which by knowledge are going to brighten up the heavenly light of Brahman, may order them to do so; that is, he prays that, by the favour of Savit<i>ri</i>, our senses should be turned away from outward things to Brahman or the Self.’ Taking the hymn as addressed to Savit<i>ri</i>, I have translated deva by gods, not by senses, suvaryata<i>h</i> by rising to the sky, namely, in the morning. The opposition between manasâ and dhiyâ is the same here as in verse 1, and again in verse 4.

[^733]: 239:2 This verse is from Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 1, 1, 1, 4; I, 2, 13, 1, 1; Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. V, 14; XI, 4; XXXVII, 2; <i>Ri</i>g-veda V, 81, 1; <i>S</i>at. Br. III, 5, 3, 11; VI, 3, 1, 16. <i>S</i>aṅkara explains this verse again in the same manner as he did the former verses, while the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a supplies two different ritual explanations.

[^734]: 240:1 For this verse, see Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 1, 1, 2, 1; Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XI, 5; Atharva-veda XVIII, 3, 39; <i>Ri</i>g-veda X, 13, 1. The Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins read vi <i>s</i>loka etu for vi <i>s</i>lokâ yanti; sûre<i>h</i> for sûrâ<i>h</i>; <i>s</i><i>ri</i><i>n</i>vantu for <i>s</i><i>ri</i><i>n</i>vanti; and the <i>Ri</i>g-veda agrees with them. The dual vâm is accounted for by the verse belonging to a hymn celebrating the two <i>s</i>akatas, carts, bearing the offerings (havirdhâne); most likely, however, the dual referred originally to the dual deities of heaven and earth. I prefer the text of the <i>Ri</i>g-veda and the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins to that of the Taittirîyas, and have translated the verse accordingly. In the Atharva-veda XVIII, 39, if we may trust the edition, the verse begins with svâsasthe bhavatam indave na<i>h</i>, which is really the end of the next verse (Rv. X, 13, 2), while the second line is, vi <i>s</i>loka eti pathyeva sûri<i>h</i> <i>s</i><i>ri</i><i>n</i>vantu vi<i>s</i>ve am<i>ri</i>tâsa etat. I see no sense in pathyeva sûrâ<i>h</i>. <i>S</i>aṅkara explains pathyeva by pathi sanmârge, athavâ pathyâ kîrti<i>h</i>, while his later commentary, giving <i>s</i><i>ri</i><i>n</i>vantu and putrâ<i>h</i> sûrâtmano hira<i>n</i>yagarbhasya, leads one to suppose that he read sûre<i>h</i> <i>s</i><i>ri</i><i>n</i>vantu. <i>S</i>âyana (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 1, 1, 2) explains pathyâ sûrâ iva by gîrvâ<i>n</i>amârga antarikshe sûryara<i>s</i>mayo yathâ prasaranti tadvat. The same, when commenting on the <i>Ri</i>g-veda (X, 13, 1), Says: pathyâ-iva sûre<i>h</i>, yathâ stotu<i>h</i> svabhûtâ pathyâ pari<i>n</i>âmasukhâvahâhutir vi<i>s</i>vân devân prati vividha<i>m</i> ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ati tadvat. Mahîdhara (Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XI, 5) refers sûre<i>h</i> (pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>itasya) to <i>s</i>loka<i>h</i>, and explains pathyeva by patho 'napetâ pathyâ ya<i>g</i>_ñ_amârgaprav<i>ri</i>ttâhuti<i>h</i>.

[^735]: 240:2 Yu<i>g</i>é cannot stand for yu_ñ_<i>g</i>e, as all commentators and translators suppose, but is a datival infinitive. Neither can yu_ñ_<i>g</i>ate in the following verse stand for yuṅkte (see Boehtlingk, s. v.), or be explained as a subjunctive form. A. reads adhirudhyate, B. abhirudhyate, with a marginal note abhinudyate. It is difficult to say whether in lighting the fire the wind should be directed towards it, or kept from it.

[^736]: 240:3 That is, at the Soma sacrifice, after the fire has been kindled and stirred by the wind, the poets, on partaking of the juice, are p. 241 inspirited for new songs. <i>S</i>aṅkara, however, suggests another explanation as more appropriate for the Upanishad, namely, ‘Where the fire, i.e. the Highest Self, which burns all ignorance, has been kindled (in the body, where it has been rubbed with the syllable Om), and where the breath has acted, i.e. has made the sound peculiar to the initial stages of Yoga, there Brahman is produced.’ In fact, what was intended to be taught was this, that we must begin with sacrificial acts, then practise yoga, then reach samâdhi, perfect knowledge, and lastly bliss.

[^737]: 241:1 We must read k<i>ri</i><i>n</i>avase, in the sense of ‘do this and nothing will hurt thee,’ or, if thou do this, thy former deeds will no longer hurt thee.

[^738]: 241:2 Cf. Bhagavadgîtâ VI, 13. Sama<i>m</i> kâya<i>s</i>irogrîva<i>m</i> dhârayan. <i>S</i>aṅkara says: trî<i>n</i>y unnatâny urogrîva<i>s</i>irâ<i>m</i>sy unnatâni yasmin <i>s</i>arire.

[^739]: 241:3 Explained by <i>S</i>aṅkara as the syllable Om.

[^740]: 241:4 Cf. Bhagavadgîtâ V, 27. Prâ<i>n</i>âpânau samau k<i>ri</i>tvâ nâsâbhyantara <i>k</i>âri<i>n</i>au. See Telang's notes, Sacred Books of the East, vol. viii, p. 68 seq.

[^741]: 241:5 A similar metaphor in Ka<i>th</i>. Up. III, 4-6; Sacred Books of the East, vol. xv, p. 13.

[^742]: 241:6 The question is whether <i>s</i>abda<i>g</i>alâsrayâdibhi<i>h</i> should be referred to mano 'nukûle, as I have translated it, or to vivar<i>g</i>ite, as <i>S</i>aṅkara seems to take it, because he renders <i>s</i>abda, sound, by noise, and p. 242 â<i>s</i>raya by ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>apa, a booth. See Bhagavadgîtâ VI, 11. In the Maitr. Up. VI, 30, Râmatîrtha explains su<i>k</i>au de<i>s</i>e by girinadîpulinaguhâdi<i>s</i>uddhastâne. See also Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras III, 2, 2.

[^743]: 242:1 Or, it may be, a crystal and the moon.

[^744]: 242:2 The Yogagu<i>n</i>a is described as the quality of each element, i.e. smell of the earth, taste of water, &c. It seems that the perception of these gunas is called yogaprav<i>ri</i>tti. Thus by fixing the thought on the tip of the nose, a perception of heavenly scent is produced; by fixing it on the tip of the tongue, a perception of heavenly taste; by fixing it on the point of the palate, a heavenly colour; by fixing it on the middle of the tongue, a heavenly touch; by fixing it on the roof of the tongue, a heavenly sound. By means of these perceptions the mind is supposed to be steadied, because it is no longer attracted by the outward objects themselves. See Yoga-sûtras I, 35.

[^745]: 242:3 Or no death, na m<i>ri</i>tyu<i>h</i>, B.

[^746]: 242:4 Pareshâm pâ<i>th</i>e tadvat sa tattvam prasamîkshya dehîti.

[^747]: 243:1 Sarvatattvair avidyâtatkâryair vi<i>s</i>uddham asa<i>m</i>sp<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>am.

[^748]: 243:2 This verse is found in the Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXXII, 4; Taitt. Âr. X, 1, 3, with slight modifications. The Vâgasaneyins read esho ha (so do A. B.) for esha hi; sa eva <i>g</i>âta<i>h</i> (A. B.) for sa vi<i>g</i>âta<i>h</i>; <i>g</i>anâs (A. B.) for <i>g</i>anâ<i>m</i>s. The Âra<i>n</i>yaka has sa vi<i>g</i>âyamâna<i>h</i> for sa vi<i>g</i>âta<i>h</i>, pratyaṅmukhâs for pratya_ñ_<i>g</i>anâ<i>m</i>s, and vi<i>s</i>vatomukha<i>h</i> for sarvatomukha<i>h</i>. Colebrooke (Essays, I, 57) gives a translation of it. If we read ganâ<i>h</i>, we must take it as a vocative.

[^749]: 243:3 B. (not A.) reads yo rudro yo 'gnau.
