SECOND ADHYÂYA [^313].

## FIRST BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A [^314].

1\. There [^315] was formerly the proud Gârgya Bâlâki [^316], a man of great reading. He said to A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru of Kâ<i>s</i>i, ‘Shall I tell you Brahman?’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said: ‘We give a thousand (cows) for that speech (of yours), for verily all people run away, saying, <i>G</i>anaka (the king of Mithilâ) is our father (patron) [^317].’

2\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the sun [^318], that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him <span id="p101"><sup><small>[ p. 101 ]</small></sup></span> verily as the supreme, the head of all beings, the king. Whoso adores him thus, becomes Supreme, the head of all beings, a king.’

3\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the moon (and in the mind), that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as the great, clad in white raiment, as Soma, the king.’ Whoso adores him thus, Soma is poured out and poured forth for him day by day, and his food does not fail [^319].

4\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the lightning (and in the heart), that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as the luminous.’ Whoso adores him thus, becomes luminous, and his offspring becomes luminous.

5\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the ether (and in the ether of the heart), that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him as what is full, and quiescent.’ Whoso adores him thus, becomes filled with offspring and cattle, and his offspring does not cease from this world.

6\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the wind (and in the breath), that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him as Indra Vaiku<i>n</i><i>th</i>a, as the unconquerable army (of the Maruts).’ Whoso adores him thus, becomes victorious, unconquerable, conquering his enemies. <span id="p102"><sup><small>[ p. 102 ]</small></sup></span> 7\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the fire (and in the heart), that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him as powerful.’ Whoso adores him thus, becomes powerful, and his offspring becomes powerful.

8\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the water (in seed, and in the heart), that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him as likeness.’ Whoso adores him thus, to him comes what is likely (or proper), not what is improper; what is born from him, is like unto him [^320].

9\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the mirror, that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as the brilliant.’ Whoso adores him thus, he becomes brilliant, his offspring becomes brilliant, and with whomsoever he comes together, he outshines them.

10\. Gârgya said: ‘The sound that follows a man while he moves, that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as life.’ Whoso adores him thus, he reaches his full age in this world, breath does not leave him before the time.

11\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in space, that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as the second who never leaves us.’

<span id="p103"><sup><small>[ p. 103 ]</small></sup></span>

Whoso adores him thus, becomes possessed of a second, his party is not cut off from him,

12\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that consists of the shadow, that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as death.’ Whoso adores him thus, he reaches his whole age in this world, death does not approach him before the time.

13\. Gârgya said: ‘The person that is in the body [^321], that I adore as Brahman.’ A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said to him: ‘No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as embodied.’ Whoso adores him thus, becomes embodied, and his offspring becomes embodied [^322].

Then Gârgya became silent.

14\. A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said: ‘Thus far only?’ ‘Thus far only,’ he replied. A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said: ‘This does not suffice to know it (the true Brahman).’ Gârgya replied: ‘Then let me come to you, as a pupil.’

15\. A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said: ‘Verily, it is unnatural that a Brâhma<i>n</i>a should come to a Kshatriya, hoping that he should tell him the Brahman. However, I shall make you know him clearly,’ thus saying he took him by the hand and rose.

And the two together came to a person who was asleep. He called him by these names, ‘Thou, great one, clad in white raiment, Soma, King [^323].’ He <span id="p104"><sup><small>[ p. 104 ]</small></sup></span> did not rise. Then rubbing him with his hand, he woke him, and he arose.

16\. A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said: ‘When this man was thus asleep, where was then the person (purusha), the intelligent? and from whence did he thus come back?’ Gârgya did not know this?

17\. A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru said: 'When this man was thus asleep, then the intelligent person (purusha), having through the intelligence of the senses (prâ<i>n</i>as) absorbed within himself all intelligence, lies in the ether, which is in the heart [^324]. When he takes in these different kinds of intelligence, then it is said that the man sleeps (svapiti) [^325]. Then the breath is kept in, speech is kept in, the ear is kept in, the eye is kept in, the mind is kept in.

18\. But when he moves about in sleep (and dream), then these are his worlds. He is, as it were, a great king; he is, as it were, a great Brâhma<i>n</i>a; he rises, as it were, and he falls. And as a great king might keep in his own subjects, and move about, according to his pleasure, within his own domain, thus does that person (who is endowed with intelligence) keep in the various senses (prâ<i>n</i>as) and move about, according to his pleasure, within his own body (while dreaming).

19\. Next, when he is in profound sleep, and knows <span id="p105"><sup><small>[ p. 105 ]</small></sup></span> nothing, there are the seventy-two thousand arteries called Hita, which from the heart spread through the body [^326]. Through them he moves forth and rests in the surrounding body. And as a young man, or a great king, or a great Brâhma<i>n</i>a, having reached the summit of happiness, might rest, so does he then rest.

20\. As the spider comes out with its thread, or as small sparks come forth from fire, thus do all senses, all worlds, all Devas, all beings come forth from that Self The Upanishad (the true name and doctrine) of that Self is ‘the True of the True.’ Verily the senses are the true, and he is the true of the true.


## SECOND BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A [^327].

1\. Verily he who knows the babe [^328] with his place [^329], his chamber [^330], his post [^331], and his rope [^332], he keeps off the seven relatives [^333] who hate him. Verily by the young is meant the inner life, by his place this (body) [^334], by his chamber this (head), by his post the vital breath, by his rope the food.

2\. Then the seven imperishable ones [^335] approach him. There are the red lines in the eye, and by them Rudra clings to him. There is the water <span id="p106"><sup><small>[ p. 106 ]</small></sup></span> in the eye, and by it Par<i>g</i>anya clings to him. There is the pupil, and by it Âditya (sun) clings to him, There is the dark iris, and by it Agni clings to him. There is the white eye-ball, and by it Indra, clings to him. With the lower eye-lash the earth, with the upper eye-lash the heaven clings to him. He who knows this, his food does never perish.

3\. On this there is this <i>S</i>loka:

‘There [^336] is a cup having its mouth below and its bottom above. Manifold glory has been placed into it. On its lip sit the seven <i>Ri</i>shis, the tongue as the eighth communicates with Brahman.’ What is called the cup having its mouth below and its bottom above is this head, for its mouth (the mouth) is below, its bottom (the skull) is above. When it is said that manifold glory has been placed into it, the senses verily are manifold glory, and he therefore means the senses. When he says that the seven <i>Ri</i>shis sit on its lip, the <i>Ri</i>shis are verily the (active) senses, and he means the senses. And when he says that the tongue as the eighth communicates with Brahman, it is because the tongue, as the eighth, does communicate with Brahman.

4\. These two (the two ears) are the <i>Ri</i>shis Gautama and Bharadvâ<i>g</i>a; the right Gautama, the left Bharadvâ<i>g</i>a. These two (the eyes) are the <i>Ri</i>shis Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra and <i>G</i>amadagni; the right Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra, the left <i>G</i>amadagni. These two (the nostrils) are the <i>Ri</i>shis Vasish<i>th</i>a and Ka<i>s</i>yapa; the right Vasish<i>th</i>a, the left Ka<i>s</i>yapa. The tongue is Atri, for with the tongue food is eaten, and Atri is meant for Atti, eating. He who knows this, becomes an eater of everything, and everything becomes his food.


<span id="p107"><sup><small>[ p. 107 ]</small></sup></span>

## THIRD BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A [^337].

1\. There are two forms of Brahman, the material and the immaterial, the mortal and the immortal, the solid and the fluid, sat (being) and tya (that), (i.e. sat-tya, true) [^338].

2\. Everything except air and sky is material, is mortal, is solid, is definite. The essence of that which is material, which is mortal, which is solid, which is definite is the sun that shines, for he is the essence of sat (the definite).

3\. But air and sky are immaterial, are immortal, are fluid, are indefinite. The essence of that which is immaterial, which is immortal, which is fluid, which is indefinite is the person in the disk of the sun, for he is the essence of tyad (the indefinite). So far with regard to the Devas.

4\. Now with regard to the body. Everything except the breath and the ether within the body is material, is mortal, is solid, is definite. The essence of that which is material, which is mortal, which is solid, which is definite is the Eye, for it is the essence of sat (the definite).

5\. But breath and the ether within the body are immaterial, are immortal, are fluid, are indefinite. The essence of that which is immaterial, which is immortal, which is fluid, which is indefinite is the person in the right eye, for he is the essence of tyad (the indefinite).

6\. And what is the appearance of that person? Like a saffron-coloured raiment, like white wool, <span id="p108"><sup><small>[ p. 108 ]</small></sup></span> like cochineal, like the flame of fire, like the white lotus, like sudden lightning. He who knows this, his glory is like unto sudden lightning.

Next follows the teaching (of Brahman) by No, no [^339]! for there is nothing else higher than this (if one says): ‘It is not so.’ Then comes the name ‘the True of the True,’ the senses being the True, and he (the Brahman) the True of them.


## FOURTH BRÂHMA<i>N</i>A [^340].

1\. Now when Yâ<i>g</i>_ñ_avalkya was going to enter upon another state, he said: ‘Maitreyî [^341], verily I am going away from this my house (into the forest [^342]). Forsooth, let me make a settlement between thee and that Kâtyâyanî (my other wife).’

2\. Maitreyî said: ‘My Lord, if this whole earth, full of wealth, belonged to me, tell me, should I be immortal by it [^343]?’

<span id="p109"><sup><small>[ p. 109 ]</small></sup></span>

‘No,’ replied Yâ<i>g</i>_ñ_avalkya; ‘like the life of rich people will be thy life. But there is no hope of immortality by wealth.’

3\. And Maitreyî said: ‘What should I do with that by which I do not become immortal? What my Lord knoweth (of immortality), tell that to me [^344].’

4\. Yâ<i>g</i>_ñ_avalkya replied: ‘Thou who art truly dear to me, thou speakest dear words [^345]. Come, sit down, I will explain it to thee, and mark well what I say.’

5\. And he said: 'Verily, a husband is not dear, that you may love the husband; but that you may love the Self, therefore a husband is dear.

‘Verily, a wife is not dear, that you may love the wife; but that you may love the Self, therefore a wife is dear.

‘Verily, sons are not dear, that you may love the sons; but that you may love the Self, therefore sons are dear.

‘Verily, wealth is not dear, that you may love wealth; but that you may love the Self, therefore wealth is dear [^346].

‘Verily, the Brahman-class is not dear, that you may love the Brahman-class; but that you may love the Self, therefore the Brahman-class is dear.

‘Verily, the Kshatra-class is not dear, that you may love the Kshatra-class; but that you may love the Self, therefore the Kshatra-class is dear.

‘Verily, the worlds are not dear, that you may love the worlds; but that you may love the Self, therefore the worlds are dear.

<span id="p110"><sup><small>[ p. 110 ]</small></sup></span>

‘Verily, the Devas are not dear, that you may love the Devas; but that you may love the Self, therefore the Devas are dear [^347].

‘Verily, creatures are not dear, that you may love the creatures; but that you may love the Self, therefore are creatures dear.

‘Verily, everything is not dear that you may love everything; but that you may love the Self, therefore everything is dear.

‘Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be perceived, to be marked, O Maitreyî! When we see, hear, perceive, and know the Self [^348], then all this is known.

6\. 'Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class elsewhere than in the Self, was [^349] abandoned by the Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the Kshatra-class elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the Kshatra-class. Whosoever looks for the worlds elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the worlds. Whosoever looks for the Devas elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the Devas [^350]. Whosoever looks for creatures elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the creatures. Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by everything. This Brahman-class, this Kshatra-class, these worlds, these Devas [^351], these [^352] creatures, this everything, all is that Self.

7\. 'Now as [^353] the sounds of a drum, when beaten, <span id="p111"><sup><small>[ p. 111 ]</small></sup></span> cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the drum is seized or the beater of the drum;

8., And as the sounds of a conch-shell, when blown, cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the shell is seized or the blower of the shell;

9\. 'And as the sounds of a lute, when played, cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the lute is seized or the player of the lute;

10\. 'As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out of a lighted fire kindled with damp fuel, thus, verily, O Maitreyî, has been breathed forth from this great Being what we have as <i>Ri</i>g-veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, Sama-veda, Atharvâṅgirasas, Itihâsa (legends), Purâ<i>n</i>a (cosmogonies), Vidyâ (knowledge), the Upanishads, <i>S</i>lokas (verses), Sûtras (prose rules), Anuvyâkhyânas (glosses), Vyâkhyânas (commentaries) [^354]. From him alone all these were breathed forth.

11\. 'As all waters find their centre in the sea, all touches in the skin, all tastes in the tongue, all smells in the nose, all colours in the eye, all sounds in the ear, all percepts in the mind, all knowledge in the heart, all actions in the hands, all movements in the feet, and all the Vedas in speech,—

12\. ‘As a lump of salt [^355], when thrown into water, becomes dissolved into water, and could not be taken <span id="p112"><sup><small>[ p. 112 ]</small></sup></span> out again, but wherever we taste (the water) it is salt,—thus verily, O Maitreyî, does this great Being, endless, unlimited, consisting of nothing but knowledge [^356], rise from out these elements, and vanish again in them. When he has departed, there is no more knowledge (name), I say, O Maitreyî.’ Thus spoke Yâ<i>g</i>_ñ_avalkya.

13\. Then Maitreyî said: ‘Here thou hast bewildered me, Sir, when thou sayest that having departed, there is no more knowledge [^357].’

But Yâ<i>g</i>_ñ_avalkya replied: 'O Maitreyî, I say nothing that is bewildering. This is enough, O beloved, for wisdom [^358].

‘For when there is as it were duality, then one sees the other, one smells the other, one hears the other [^359], one salutes the other [^360], one perceives the other [^361], one knows the other; but when the Self only is all this, how should he smell another [^362], how should he see [^363] another [^364], how should he hear [^365] another, how should he salute [^366] another, how should he perceive another [^367], how should he know another? How should he know Him by whom he knows all this? <span id="p113"><sup><small>[ p. 113 ]</small></sup></span> How, O beloved, should he know (himself), the Knower [1](../Brihadaranyaka_2#fn368)?’

16\. Verily Dadhyak Âtharva<i>n</i>a proclaimed this honey (the madhu-vidyâ) to the two A<i>s</i>vins, and a <i>Ri</i>shi, seeing this, said (Rv. I, 116, 12):

‘He (the Lord) made bodies with two feet, he made bodies with four feet. Having first become a bird, he entered the bodies as purusha (as the person).’ This very purusha is in all bodies the puri<i>s</i>aya, i.e. he who lies in the body (and is therefore called purusha). There is nothing that is not covered by him, nothing that is not filled by him.

This (Âtman) is the horses, this (Âtman) is the ten, and the thousands, many and endless. This is the Brahman, without cause and without effect, without anything inside or outside; this Self is Brahman, omnipresent and omniscient. This is the teaching (of the Upanishads).

## Footnotes

[^313]: 100:1 Mâdhyandina text, p. 1058.

[^314]: 100:2 Whatever has been taught to the end of the third (according to the counting of the Upanishad, the first) Adhyâya, refers to avidyâ, ignorance. Now, however, vidyâ, the highest knowledge, is to be taught, and this is done, first of all, by a dialogue between Gârgya D<i>ri</i>ptabâlâki and king A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru, the former, though a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, representing the imperfect, the latter, though a Kshatriya, the perfect knowledge of Brahman. While Gârgya worships the Brahman as the sun, the moon, &c., as limited, as active and passive, A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru knows the Brahman as the Self.

[^315]: 100:3 Compare with this the fourth Adhyâya of the Kaushîtaki-upanishad, Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 300; Gough, Philosophy of the Upanishads, p. 144.

[^316]: 100:4 Son of Balâkâ, of the race of the Gârgyas.

[^317]: 100:5 <i>G</i>anaka, known as a wise and liberal king. There is a play on his name, which means father, and is understood in the sense of patron, or of teacher of wisdom. The meaning is obscure; and in the Kaush. Up. IV. i, the construction is still more difficult. What is intended seems to be that A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru is willing to offer any reward to a really wise man, because all the wise men are running after <i>G</i>anaka and settling at his court.

[^318]: 100:6 The commentator expatiates on all these answers and brings them more into harmony with Vedanta doctrines. Thus he adds that the person in the sun is at the same time the person in the eye, who is both active and passive in the heart, &c.

[^319]: 101:1 We miss the annasyâtmâ, the Self of food, mentioned in the Kaush. Up., and evidently referred to in the last sentence of our paragraph. Suta and prasuta, poured out and poured forth, are explained as referring to the principal and the secondary sacrifices.

[^320]: 102:1 Here the Kaush. Up. has the Self of the name, instead of pratirûpa, likeness. The commentator thinks that they both mean the same thing, because a name is the likeness of a thing. Another text of the Kaush. Up. gives here the Self of light. Pratirûpa in the sense of likeness comes in later in the Kaush. Up., § 11.

[^321]: 103:1 ‘In the Âtman, in Pra<i>g</i>âpati, in the Buddhi, and in the heart.’ Comm.

[^322]: 103:2 It is difficult to know what is meant here by âtman and âtmanvin. In the Kaush. Up. A<i>g</i>âta<i>s</i>atru refers to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the commentator here does the same, adding, however, buddhi and h<i>ri</i>d. Gough translates âtmanvin by ‘having peace of mind.’ Deussen, p. 195, passes it over.

[^323]: 103:3 These names are given here as they occur in the Kaushîtaki-upanishad, not as in the B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka-upanishad, where the p. 104 first name was atish<i>th</i>â<i>h</i> sarveshâm bhûtânâm mûrdhâ râ<i>g</i>â. This throws an important light on the composition of the Upanishads.

[^324]: 104:1 The ether in the heart is meant for the real Self. He has come to himself, to his Self, i.e. to the true Brahman.

[^325]: 104:2 Svapiti, he sleeps, is explained as sva, his own Self, and apiti for apyeti, he goes towards, so that ‘he sleeps’ must be interpreted as meaning ‘he comes to his Self.’ In another passage it is explained by svam apîto bhavati. See <i>S</i>aṅkara's Commentary on the B<i>ri</i>h. Âr. Up. vol. i, p. 372.

[^326]: 105:1 ‘Not the pericardium only, but the whole body.’ Comm.

[^327]: 105:2 Mâdhyandina text, p. 1061.

[^328]: 105:3 The liṅgâtman, or subtle body which has entered this body in five ways. Comm.

[^329]: 105:4 The body.

[^330]: 105:5 The head.

[^331]: 105:6 The vital breath.

[^332]: 105:7 Food, which binds the subtle to the coarse body.

[^333]: 105:8 The seven organs of the head through which man perceives and becomes attached to the world.

[^334]: 105:9 The commentator remarks that while saying this, the body and the head are pointed out by touching them with the hand (pâ<i>n</i>ipeshapratibodhanena).

[^335]: 105:10 See before, I, 5, 1, 2. They are called imperishable, because they produce imperishableness by supplying food for the prâ<i>n</i>a, here called the babe.

[^336]: 106:1 Cf. Atharva-veda-sa<i>m</i>h. X, 8, 9.

[^337]: 107:1 Mâdhyandina text, p. 1062.

[^338]: 107:2 Sat is explained by definite, tya or tyad by indefinite.

[^339]: 108:1 See III, 9, 26; IV, 2,4; IV, 4, 22; IV, 5, I5.

[^340]: 108:2 Mâdhyandina text, p. 1062. To the end of the third Brâhma<i>n</i>a of the second Adhyâya, all that has been taught does not yet impart the highest knowledge, the identity of the personal and the true Self, the Brahman. In the fourth Brâhma<i>n</i>a, in which the knowledge of the true Brahman is to be set forth, the Sa<i>m</i>nyâsa, the retiring from the world, is enjoined, when all desires cease, and no duties are to be performed (Sa<i>m</i>nyâsa, pârivâ<i>g</i>ya). The story is told again with slight variations in the B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka-upanishad IV, 5. The more important variations, occurring in IV, 5, are added here, marked with B. There are besides the various readings of the Mâdhyandina<i>s</i>âkhâ of the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a. See also Deussen, Vedânta, p. 185.

[^341]: 108:3 In B<i>ri</i>h. Up. IV, 5, the story begins: Yâ<i>g</i>_ñ_avalkya had two wives, Maitreyî and Kâtyâyanî. Of these Maitreyî was conversant with Brahman, but Kâtyâyanî possessed such knowledge only as women possess.

[^342]: 108:4 Instead of udyâsyan, B. gives pravra<i>g</i>ishyan, the more technical term.

[^343]: 108:5 Should I be immortal by it, or no? B.

[^344]: 109:1 Tell that clearly to me. B.

[^345]: 109:2 Thou who art dear to me, thou hast increased what is dear (to me in this). B.

[^346]: 109:3 B. adds, Verily, cattle are not dear, &c.

[^347]: 110:1 B. inserts, Verily, the Vedas are not dear, &c.

[^348]: 110:2 When the Self has been seen, heard, perceived, and known. B.

[^349]: 110:3 The commentator translates, ‘should be abandoned.’

[^350]: 110:4 B. inserts, Whosoever looks for the Vedas, &c.

[^351]: 110:5 B. adds, these Vedas.

[^352]: 110:6 B. has, all these creatures.

[^353]: 110:7 I construe sa yathâ with evam vai in § 12, looking upon p. 111 § 11 as probably a later insertion. The sa is not the pronoun, but a particle, as in sa yadi, sa <i>k</i>et, &c.

[^354]: 111:1 B. adds, what is sacrificed, what is poured out, food, drink, this world and the other world, and all creatures.

[^355]: 111:2 See <i>Kh</i>ând. Up. VI, 13.

[^356]: 112:1 As a mass of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of taste, thus indeed has that Self neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge. B.

[^357]: 112:2 ‘Here, Sir, thou hast landed me in utter bewilderment. Indeed, I do not understand him.’ B.

[^358]: 112:3 Verily, beloved, that Self is imperishable, and of an indestructible nature. B.

[^359]: 112:4 B. inserts, one tastes the other.

[^360]: 112:5 B. inserts, one hears the other.

[^361]: 112:6 B. inserts, one touches the other.

[^362]: 112:7 See, B.

[^363]: 112:8 Smell, B.

[^364]: 112:9 B. inserts taste.

[^365]: 112:10 Salute, B.

[^366]: 112:11 Hear, B.

[^367]: 112:12 B. inserts, how should he touch another?

[^368]: 113:1 Instead of the last line, B. adds (IV, 5, 15): That Self is to be described by No, no! He is incomprehensible, for be cannot be comprehended; he is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. How, O beloved, should he know the Knower? Thus, O Maitreyî, thou hast been instructed. Thus far goes immortality.' Having said so, Yâ<i>g</i>_ñ_avalkya went away (into the forest). 15. See also <i>Kh</i>ând. Up. VII, 24, 1.

[^369]: 113:2 Mâdhyandina text, p. 1064.

[^370]: 113:3 Madhu, honey, seems to be taken here as an instance of something which is both cause and effect, or rather of things which are mutually dependent on each other, or cannot exist without one other. As the bees make the honey, and the honey makes or supports the bees, bees and honey are both cause and effect, or at all events are mutually dependent on one other. In the same way the earth and all living beings are looked upon as mutually dependent, living beings presupposing the earth, and the earth presupposing living beings. This at all events seems to be the general idea of what is called the Madhuvidyâ, the science of honey, which Dadhya<i>k</i> communicated to the A<i>s</i>vins.

[^371]: 115:1 Stanayitnu, thunder, is explained by the commentator as Par<i>g</i>anya.

[^372]: 115:2 Satyam, the true, the real, not, as it is generally translated, the truth.

[^373]: 116:1 The translation here follows the commentary.

[^374]: 116:2 Tanyatu, here explained as Par<i>g</i>anya.

[^375]: 116:3 <i>S</i>aṅkara distinguishes here between Atharva<i>n</i>a and Âtharva<i>n</i>a, if the text is correct.

[^376]: 117:1 <i>S</i>aṅkara explains Tvasht<i>ri</i> as the sun, and the sun as the head of the sacrifice which, having been cut off, was to be replaced by the pravargya rite. The knowledge of this rite forms the honey of Tvasht<i>ri</i>. The other honey which is to be kept secret is the knowledge of the Self, as taught before in the Madhu-brâhma<i>n</i>a.

[^377]: 117:2 He assumed all forms, and such forms, as two-footed or four-footed animals, remained permanent. Comm.

[^378]: 118:1 The line of teachers and pupils by whom the Madhukâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a (the fourth Brâhma<i>n</i>a) was handed down. The Mâdhyandina-<i>s</i>âkhâ begins with ourselves, then 1. Saurpa<i>n</i>âyya, 2. Gautama, 3. Vâtsya, 4. Vâtsya and Pârâ<i>s</i>arya, 5. Sâṅk<i>ri</i>tya and Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, 6. Audavâhi and Sâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya, 7. Vai<i>g</i>avâpa and Gautama, 8. Vai<i>g</i>avâpâyana and Vaish<i>t</i>apureya, 9. Sâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya and Rauhi<i>n</i>âyana, 10. <i>S</i>aunaka Âtreya, and Raibhya, 11. Pautimâshyâya<i>n</i>a and Kau<i>n</i><i>d</i>inyâyana: 12. Kau<i>n</i><i>d</i>inya, 13. Kau<i>n</i><i>d</i>inya, 14. Kau<i>n</i><i>d</i>inya and Âgnive<i>s</i>ya, 15. Saitava, 16. Pârâ<i>s</i>arya, 17. <i>G</i>âtukar<i>n</i>ya, 18. Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, 19. Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, Âsurâya<i>n</i>a, and Gautama, 20. Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, 21. Vai<i>g</i>avâpâyana. Then the same as the Kâ<i>n</i>vas to <i>G</i>âtukar<i>n</i>ya, who learns from Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, who learns from Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, Âsurâya<i>n</i>a, and Yâska. Then Traiva<i>n</i>i &c. as in the Kâ<i>n</i>va-va<i>m</i>sa.

[^379]: 119:1 From here the Va<i>m</i>sa agrees with the Va<i>m</i>sa at the end of IV, 6.
