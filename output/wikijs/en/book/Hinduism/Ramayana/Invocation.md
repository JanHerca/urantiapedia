Praise to Válmíki, [^1] bird of charming song, [^2]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who mounts on Poesy's sublimest spray,
And sweetly sings with accent clear and strong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ráma, aye Ráma, in his deathless lay.

Where breathes the man can listen to the strain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flows in music from Válmíki's tongue,
Nor feel his feet the path of bliss attain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ráma's glory by the saint is sung!

The stream Rámáyan leaves its sacred fount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole wide world from sin and stain to free. [1b](Book_1_10#fn3)
The Prince of Hermits is the parent mount,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lordly Ráma is the darling sea.

Glory to him whose fame is ever bright!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory to him, Prachetas'  [2b](Book_1_10#fn4) holy son!
Whose pure lips quaff with ever new delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nectar-sea of deeds by Ráma done.

Hail, arch-ascetic, pious, good, and kind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, Saint Válmíki, lord of every lore!
Hail, holy Hermit, calm and pure of mind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, First of Bards, Válmíki, hail once more!

## Footnotes

[^0]: 1:1 The MSS. vary very considerably in these stanzas of invocation: many lines are generally prefixed in which not only the poet, but those who play the chief parts in the poem are panegyrized. It is self-apparent that they are not by the author of the Rámáyan himself.

[^1]: 1:2 ‘Válmíki was the son of Varuna, the regent of the waters, one of whose names is Prachetas. According to the _Adhyátmá Rámáyana_, the sage, although a Bráhman by birth, associated with foresters and robbers. Attacking on one occasion the seven Rishis, they expostulated with him successfully, and taught him the _mantra_ of Ráma reversed, or _Mará_, _Mará_, in the inaudible repetition of which he remained immovable for thousands of years, so that when the sages returned to the same spot they found him still there, converted into a _valmik_ or ant-hill, by the nests of the termites, whence his name of Válmíki.’
  WILSON. _Specimens of the Hindu Theatre, Vol. I. p_. 313.
  ‘Válmíki is said to have lived a solitary life in the woods: he is called both a _muni_ and a _rishi_. The former word properly signifies an anchorite or hermit; the latter has reference chiefly to wisdom. The two words are frequently used promiscuously, and may both be rendered by the Latin _cates_ in its earliest meaning of _seer_: Válmíki was both poet and seer, as he is said to have sung the exploits of Ráma by the aid of divining insight rather than of knowledge naturally acquired.’ SCHLEGEL.

[^2]: 1:3 Literally, _Kokila_, the Koil, or Indian Cuckoo. Schlegel translates ‘luscinium.’
