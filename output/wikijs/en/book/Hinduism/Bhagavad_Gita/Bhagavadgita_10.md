Yet again, O you of mighty arms! listen to my excellent [^342] words, which, out of a wish for your welfare, I speak to you who are delighted (with them). Not the multitudes of gods, nor the great sages know my source; for I am in every way [^343] the origin of the gods and great sages. Of (all) mortals, he who knows me to be unborn, without beginning, the great lord of the world, being free from delusion, is released from all sins. Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from delusion, forgiveness, truth, restraint of the senses, tranquillity, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear, and also security, harmlessness, equability, contentment, penance, (making) gifts, glory, disgrace, all these different tempers [^344] of living beings are from me alone. The seven great sages, and likewise the four ancient Manus [^345], whose descendants are (all) these people in the world, were all born from my <span id="p87">[<sup><small>p. 87</small></sup>]</span> mind [^346], (partaking) of my powers. Whoever correctly knows these powers and emanations of mine, becomes possessed of devotion free from indecision; of this (there is) no doubt. The wise, full of love [^347], worship me, believing that I am the origin of all, and that all moves on through me. (Placing their) minds on me, offering (their) lives to me, instructing each other, and speaking about me, they are always contented and happy. To these, who are constantly devoted, and who worship with love,, I give that knowledge by which they attain to me. And remaining in their hearts, I destroy, with the brilliant lamp of knowledge, the darkness born of ignorance in such (men) only, out of compassion for them.

Ar<i>g</i>una said:

You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme goal, the holiest of the holy. All sages, as well as the divine sage Nârada, Asita [^348], Devala, and Vyâsa, call you the eternal being, divine, the first god, the unborn, the all-pervading. And so, too, you tell me yourself, O Kesava! I believe all this that you tell me (to be) true; for, O lord! neither the gods nor demons understand your manifestation [^349]. You only know your self by your self. O best of beings! creator of all things! lord of all things! god of gods! lord of the universe! be pleased to declare without, exception your divine emanations, by which emanations <span id="p88">[<sup><small>p. 88</small></sup>]</span> you stand pervading all these worlds. How shall I know you, O you of mystic power! always meditating on you? And in what various entities [^350], O lord! should I meditate on you? Again, O Ganârdana! do you yourself declare your powers and emanations; because hearing this nectar, I (still) feel no satiety.

The Deity said:

Well then, O best of Kauravas! I will state to you my own divine emanations; but (only) the chief (ones), for there is no end to the extent of my (emanations). I am the self, O Gu<i>d</i>âkesa! seated in the hearts of all beings [^351]. I am the beginning and the middle and the end also of all beings. I am Vish<i>n</i>u among the Âdityas [^352], the beaming sun among the shining (bodies); I am Marî<i>k</i>i among the Maruts [^353], and the moon among the lunar mansions [^354]. Among the Vedas, I am the Sâma-veda [^355]. I am Indra among the gods. And I am mind among the senses [^356]. I am consciousness in (living) beings. And I am <i>S</i>ankara [^357] among the Rudras, the lord of wealth [^358] among Yakshas and Rakshases. And I am fire among the Vasus, and Meru [^359] among the high-topped (mountains). And know me, O Ar<i>g</i>una! to <span id="p89">[<sup><small>p. 89</small></sup>]</span> be B<i>ri</i>haspati, the chief among domestic priests. I am Skanda among generals. I am the ocean among reservoirs of water [^360]. I am Bh<i>ri</i>gu among the great sages. I am the single syllable (Om  [^361]) among words. Among sacrifices I am the <i>G</i>apa sacrifice [^362]; the Himâlaya among the firmly-fixed (mountains); the A<i>s</i>vattha [^363] among all trees, and Nârada among divine sages; <i>K</i>itraratha among the heavenly choristers, the sage Kapila among the Siddhas [^364]. Among horses know me to be U<i>ri</i>ai<i>ri</i>ravas [^365], brought forth by (the labours for) the nectar; and Airâvata among the great elephants, and the ruler. of men among men [^366]. I am the thunderbolt among weapons, the wish-giving (cow) among cows. And I am love which generates [^367]. Among serpents I am Vâsuki. Among Nâga [^368] snakes I am Ananta; I am Varu<i>n</i>a among aquatic beings. And I am Aryaman among the manes, and Yama [^369] among rulers. Among demons, too, I am Pralhâda. I am the king of death (Kâla, time) among those that count [^370]. Among beasts I <span id="p90">[<sup><small>p. 90</small></sup>]</span> am the lord of beasts, and the son of Vinatâ [^371] among birds. I am the wind among those that blow [^372]. I am Râma [^373] among those that wield weapons. Among fishes I am Makara [^374], and among streams the <i>G</i>âhnavî [^375]. Of created things I am the beginning and the end and the middle also, O Ar<i>g</i>una! Among sciences, I am the science of the Adhyâtma, and I am the argument of controversialists. Among letters I am the letter A [^376], and among the group of compounds the copulative [^377] compound. I myself am time inexhaustible, and I the creator whose faces are in all directions. I am death who seizes all, and the source of what is to be. And among females, fame [^378], fortune, speech, memory, intellect, courage. forgiveness. Likewise among Sâman hymns, I am the B<i>ri</i>hat-sâman [^379], and I the Gâyatrî [^380] among metres. I am Mârga<i>s</i>îrsha among the months, the spring <span id="p91">[<sup><small>p. 91</small></sup>]</span> among the seasons [^381]; of cheats, I am the game of dice; I am the glory of the glorious, I am victory, I am industry, I am the goodness of the good. I am Vâsudeva among the descendants of V<i>ri</i>sh_ni_ [^382], and Ar<i>g</i>una among the Pâ<i>ri</i>avas. Among sages also, I am Vyâsa [^383]; and among the discerning ones, I am the discerning U<i>s</i>anas [^384]. I am the rod of those that restrain, and the policy [^385] of those that desire victory. I am silence respecting secrets. I am the knowledge of those that have knowledge And, O Ar<i>g</i>una! I am also that which is the seed of all things. There is nothing movable or immovable which can exist without me. O terror of your foes! there is no end to my divine emanations. Here I have declared the extent of (those) emanations only in part. Whatever thing (there is) of power, or glorious, or splendid, know all that to be produced from portions of my energy. Or rather, O Ar<i>g</i>una! what have you to do, knowing all this at large? I stand supporting all this by (but) a single portion (of myself) [^386].

[^348]: 87:2 <i>S</i>ankara renders the word here by perseverance in pursuit of truth.
