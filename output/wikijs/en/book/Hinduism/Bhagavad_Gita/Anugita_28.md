Brahman said:

Among men the royal Kshatriya is the middle [^1705] quality; among vehicles the elephant [^1706], and among denizens, of the forest the lion; among all sacrificial animals the sheep, and among the dwellers in holes the snake; among cattle also the bull, and among <span id="p346"><sup><small>[ p. 346 ]</small></sup></span> females a male [^1707]. The Nyagrodha, the <i>G</i>ambu, the Pippala, and likewise the <i>S</i>âlmali, the Sin<i>s</i>apâ, and the. Meshas<i>ri</i>nga, and likewise the bamboo and willow [^1708]; these are the princes among trees in this world, there is no doubt of that. The Himavat, the Pâriyâtra, the Sahya, the Vindhya, the Trikû<i>t</i>avat, the <i>S</i>veta, the Nîla, the Bhâsa, and the Kosh<i>ri</i>avat mountain, the Mahendra, the Guruskandha; and likewise the Mâlyavat mountain, these are the princes among mountains [^1709]. Likewise the Maruts are (the princes) among the Ga<i>n</i>as; the sun is the prince among the planets, and the moon [^1710] among the Nakshatras; Yama is the prince among the Pit<i>ri</i>s, and the ocean among rivers; Varu<i>n</i>a is the king of the waters, and Indra is said to be (the king) of the Maruts. Arka is the king of hot (bodies), and Indu is said to be (the king) of shining bodies. Fire is ever the lord of the elements [^1711], and B<i>ri</i>haspati of Brâhma<i>n</i>as; Soma is the lord of herbs, Vish<i>n</i>u is the chief among the strong; Tvash_tri_ is the prince <span id="p347"><sup><small>[ p. 347 ]</small></sup></span> of the Rudras, and <i>S</i>iva is the ruler of (all) creatures; likewise, sacrifice of (all) initiatory ceremonies [^1712], and Maghavat [^1713] likewise of the gods; the north among the quarters, and among all vipras the powerful king Soma [^1714]; Kubera (is lord) of all jewels, Purandara of (all) deities. Such is the highest creation among all entities. Pra<i>g</i>âpati (is lord) of all peoples; and of all entities whatever I, who am full of the Brahman, and great, (am lord). There is no higher being than myself or Vish<i>n</i>u. The great Vish<i>n</i>u full of the Brahman is the king of kings over all. Understand him to be the ruler, the creator, the uncreated Hari. For he is the ruler of men, Kinnaras, and Yakshas; of Gandharvas, snakes, and Rakshases; of gods, demons, and Nâgas. Among all those who are followed by (men) full of desires, (the chief) is [^1715] the great goddess Mâhe<i>s</i>varî, who has beautiful eyes. She is called Pârvatî. Know the goddess Umâ [^1716] to be the best and (most) holy of (all) females. Among women who are (a source [^1717] of) happiness, likewise, the brilliant [^1718] Apsarases (are chief). Kings desire <span id="p348"><sup><small>[ p. 348 ]</small></sup></span> piety; and Brâhma<i>n</i>as are the bridges [^1719] of piety. Therefore a king should always endeavour to protect the twice-born [^1720]. Those kings in whose dominions good men lie low, lose all their qualifications [^1721], and go into wrong paths after death. But those high-souled kings in whose dominions good men are protected, rejoice in this world, and attain the infinite (seat) after death. Understand this, O chiefs of the twice-born! I shall now proceed to state the invariable characteristics of piety. Non-destruction is the highest piety [^1722], and destruction is of the nature of impiety. Enlightenment [^1723] is the characteristic of gods; action [^1724] the characteristic of men; sound is the characteristic of space; (the sensation of) touch is the characteristic of air; colour is the characteristic of light; taste is the characteristic of water; the characteristic of earth, the supporter of all beings, is smell; words are the characteristic of speech [^1725] refined into vowels and consonants; the characteristic of mind is thought. Likewise as to what is described here as understanding, a determination <span id="p349"><sup><small>[ p. 349 ]</small></sup></span> is here formed by (that) understanding about objects which have been thought over by the mind [^1726]. And there is no doubt of this that determination is the characteristic of the understanding. The characteristic of mind is meditation [^1727]; and the characteristic of a good man is (living) unperceived [^1728]. The characteristic of devotion is action [^1729]; and knowledge, the characteristic of renunciation. Therefore a man of understanding should practice renunciation, giving prominence to knowledge [^1730]. The renouncer possessed of knowledge attains the highest goal. And crossing beyond darkness, and transcending death and old age, he repairs to that which has no second [^1731]. Thus have I duly spoken to you concerning the characteristic of piety. I will now proceed to explain properly the comprehension [^1732] of the qualities. As to the smell of the earth, verily, that is comprehended by the nose; and the wind [^1733] likewise residing in the nose is a pointed [^1734] to the knowledge of smell. Taste [^1735], <span id="p350"><sup><small>[ p. 350 ]</small></sup></span> the essence of water, is always comprehended by the tongue. And the moon likewise, who resides in the tongue, is appointed to the knowledge of taste. The quality of light is colour, and that is comprehended by the eye; and the sun residing in the eye is appointed always to the knowledge of colour. The (sensation of) touch, belonging to the air, is perceived by the skin, and the wind [^1736] residing in the skin is always appointed to the knowledge of (the objects) of touch. The quality of space is sound, and that is comprehended by the ear. And all the quarters residing in the ear are celebrated as (being appointed) to the knowledge of sound. Thought is the quality of mind, and that is comprehended by the understanding. The supporter of consciousness [^1737] residing in the heart is appointed to the knowledge of mind [^1738]. The understanding (is comprehended in the form of) determination, and the Mahat [^1739] of knowledge. To (this) positive comprehension, the unperceived [^1740] (is appointed), there is no doubt of that. The Kshetra<i>g</i>ña, which is in its essence devoid of qualities and eternal, is not to be comprehended by any <span id="p351"><sup><small>[ p. 351 ]</small></sup></span> symbols. Therefore the characteristic of the Kshetra<i>g</i>ña, which is void of symbols [^1741], is purely knowledge. The unperceived is stated to be the Kshetra [^1742] in which the qualities are produced and absorbed. And I always see, know, and hear it, (though) concealed. The Purusha knows it, therefore is he called Kshetra<i>g</i>ña [^1743]. And the Kshetra<i>g</i>ña likewise perceives all the operations of the qualities [^1744]. The qualities created again and again, do not know themselves [^1745], being nonintelligent, to be created and tied down to a beginning, middle, and end [^1746]. Only the Kshetra<i>g</i>ña attains, no one, (else) attains, to the truth, which is great, transcendent, and beyond the qualities and the entities (produced) [^1747] from the qualities. Hence a man who understands piety, abandoning qualities, and the creation [^1748], in this world, and transcending the qualities, and having his sins destroyed, then enters into the Kshetra<i>g</i>ña. One who is free from the pairs of opposites, free from the ceremony of salutations, and <span id="p352"><sup><small>[ p. 352 ]</small></sup></span> from the svâhâ ceremony [1](../Anugita_29#fn1749), who is unmoving, and homeless [2](../Anugita_29#fn1750), is the Kshetra<i>g</i>ña, he is the Supreme Lord.

## Footnotes

[^1709]: 345:1 I. e. creating or acting, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra. I think it probable that it was meant to go with the preceding words. See Gîtâ, [p. 83](../Bhagavadgita_9#p83) note; but, for this, ‘changing’ must be in the accusative. It is in the nominative. As the original stands, and on Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra's interpretation, the sense seems to be that when he is about to engage fin the work of creation, he can obtain as many bodies as he likes. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a compares <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 526. And see pp. [249](../Anugita_4#p249), [327](../Anugita_23#p327) supra. Can always perceive = invariably obtains when he wishes.

[^1710]: 345:2 Cf. Gîtâ, pp. [83](../Bhagavadgita_9#p83), [93](../Bhagavadgita_11#p93), and note [1](../Bhagavadgita_11#fn388) there.

[^1711]: 345:3 Cf. Gîtâ, pp. [85](../Bhagavadgita_9#p85), [118](../Bhagavadgita_17#p118).

[^1712]: 345:4 I. e. passion—that quality—is dominant in the Kshatriya, Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a. See [p. 329](../Anugita_24#p329) supra.

[^1713]: 345:5 Commenting on Gîtâ V, 18 ([p. 65](../Bhagavadgita_5#p65)) <i>S</i>ankara calls the elephant atyantatâmasa, belonging entirely to the quality of darkness.

[^1714]: 346:1 As to the constructions here, cf. generally Gîtâ, [p. 88](../Bhagavadgita_10#p88), and see the remarks of Râmânu<i>g</i>a and <i>S</i>rîdhara on Gîtâ X, 21. The meaning here is, of course, the male is ruler over females.

[^1715]: 346:2 I do not know what distinction is intended between these two. Generally kî<i>k</i>aka is used for the hollow bamboo, which whistles when the wind blows through it.

[^1716]: 346:3 Some of these mountains are mentioned in Patañ<i>g</i>ali. See Introduction.

[^1717]: 346:4 This list may be compared with that at Gîtâ, chapter X. Sometimes the same object occurs more than once with reference to more than one class; thus the moon occurs as lord of Nakshatras, of shining bodies, and of herbs—unless Soma there stands for the Soma plant. See Gîtâ, [p. 113](../Bhagavadgita_15#p113). Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says expressly that the moon occurs more than once as the correlatives, the classes with reference to which she is mentioned, are different. In such cases I have kept the original names untranslated; Arka = sun; Indu = moon.

[^1718]: 346:5 Cf. Ka<i>th</i>a, p. 83.

[^1719]: 347:1 This must mean, I presume, that the sacrifice is higher than the initiation, as male than female, see [p. 316](../Anugita_20#p316), note [1](../Anugita_20#fn1512).

[^1720]: 347:2 This is another repetition. Indra has been mentioned before, and Purandara is mentioned further on.

[^1721]: 347:3 As to king Soma, see inter alia B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, p. 237; <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 342, where <i>S</i>ankara explains ‘king’ by adding ‘of Brâhma<i>n</i>as.’ Vipras = Brâhmanas.

[^1722]: 347:4 I. e. Mâhe<i>s</i>varî is the most beautiful of womankind.

[^1723]: 347:5 It is well known that Umâ, Pârvatî, Mâhe<i>s</i>varî are names of the consort of the third member of the Hindu Trinity; see Kena, p. 13, and <i>S</i>ankara's comment there. See, too, Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv, p. 421, and Taittirîya-âranyaka, p. 839.

[^1724]: 347:6 The idea of ‘source’ is supplied by Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra.

[^1725]: 347:7 Literally, ‘rich.’ Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra paraphrases it by ‘<i>G</i>yotishmatî.’ Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a's explanation here is not quite clear.

[^1726]: 348:1 I. e. instrumental in piety, or guides to piety. Cf. <i>S</i>vetâ<i>s</i>vatara, p. 370; Mu<i>nd</i>aka, p. 297.

[^1727]: 348:2 So literally, doubtless Brâhma<i>n</i>as only are intended here.

[^1728]: 348:3 I. e., I presume, they lose all their merits, their good points are destroyed by this dereliction of duty.

[^1729]: 348:4 Cf. [p. 291](../Anugita_13#p291) supra. Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra begins a fresh chapter with ‘I shall now,’ &c.

[^1730]: 348:5 Knowledge of the truth, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra.

[^1731]: 348:6 I. e. action performed for the purpose of obtaining the fruit of it. The next five items refer to the five elements and their characteristic properties. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a's explanation, that all these are merely parallels not stated for their own relevancy here, but as illustrations, seems to be the only available one.

[^1732]: 348:7 I. e. the learning of other people, Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a. The meaning seems to be that we know speech only in its manifestation in the form of words.

[^1733]: 349:1 The text here is rather unsatisfactory; I have adopted that which I find in the copy containing Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra's commentary.

[^1734]: 349:2 Frequent pondering on matters learnt from <i>S</i>âstras or common life, Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a. Why mind comes twice the commentators do not explain.

[^1735]: 349:3 Does this refer to, what is said at Sanatsu<i>g</i>âtîya, [p. 159](../Sanatsugatiya_2#p159).

[^1736]: 349:4 Devotion means here, as in the Gîtâ, action without desire of fruits. For action the word here is the same as at Gîtâ, [p. 115](../Bhagavadgita_16#p115), note [2](../Sanatsugatiya_2#fn644).

[^1737]: 349:5 Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 52](../Bhagavadgita_2#p52), note [7](../Bhagavadgita_3#fn157).

[^1738]: 349:6 This is Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra's interpretation, and appears to me to be correct. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a's is different, but seems to omit all account of abhyeti, repairs.’

[^1739]: 349:7 Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra's interpretation seems to be different, but our copy is not quite intelligible.

[^1740]: 349:8 See [p. 337](../Anugita_27#p337) supra. The wind is the presiding deity of the nasal organ.

[^1741]: 349:9 I. e. that is its function. Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says, ‘it is pondered on,’ which is not clear.

[^1742]: 349:10 Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 74](../Bhagavadgita_7#p74), as to taste and water.

[^1743]: 350:1 This cannot be the presiding deity here, though one expects such deity to be mentioned; see [p. 337](../Anugita_27#p337) supra.

[^1744]: 350:2 The text of more than one of the lines here is rather doubtful; we follow Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, who takes this to mean the <i>g</i>îva, the individual soul. Cf. [p. 239](../Anugita_2#p239), note [2](../Anugita_2#fn1095) supra.

[^1745]: 350:3 I. e. thought, as Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a points out.

[^1746]: 350:4 Mahat is properly the same as buddhi, understanding, but as it is here mentioned separately, I suppose, it signifies Ahankâra. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a takes its operation, here called knowledge, to mean ‘the feeling I am,’ which agrees with our interpretation, for which some support is also to be derived from [p. 333](../Anugita_25#p333) supra.

[^1747]: 350:5 I here follow Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, though somewhat diffidently. The knowledge ‘this is I,’ and the knowledge ‘this is so and so and nothing else’ is presided over by the unperceived—the Prakriti.

[^1748]: 351:1 See Sanatsu<i>g</i>âtîya, [p. 146](../Sanatsugatiya_Intro#p146). See also [p. 309](../Anugita_19#p309) supra.

[^1749]: 351:2 See Gîtâ, [p. 102](../Bhagavadgita_12#p102) seq.

[^1750]: 351:3 I. e. he who knows the Kshetra.

[^1751]: 351:4 Enlightenment, activity, and delusion, Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a.

[^1752]: 351:5 I. e. do not know the self, Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a; better, I think, the qualities do not know themselves, only the Kshetra<i>g</i>ña knows them.' Cf. <i>S</i>ânti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 194, st. 41.

[^1753]: 351:6 I. e. production, existence, and destruction, Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a. This must, however, mean their manifestation, continuance, and dissolution in any particular form. For the prak<i>nth</i>ti, which is made up of the three qualities, is beginningless. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 104](../Bhagavadgita_13#p104).

[^1754]: 351:7 I. e. the actual physical manifestations, as we may say, of the qualities.

[^1755]: 351:8 The original, sattva, Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a renders by buddhi, and qualities by visible objects. In the familiar Sânkhya phrase sattvapurushânyatâpratyaya sattva means creation, or what is other than purusha (cf. Sânkhyatattvakaumudî, pp. 9-144). That is the meaning here. See too [p. 371](../Anugita_32#p371) infra, and <i>S</i>ânti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 194, st. 38 seq. and comments there.
