The G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra of Gobhila differs from those of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, Â<i>ri</i>valâyana, Pâraskara, Hira<i>ri</i>yake<i>ri</i>in in one essential point: while these texts presuppose only the same Vedic Sa<i>ri</i>hitâs on which also the corresponding <i>S</i>rauta-sûtras are based, viz. the <i>Ri</i>g-veda-Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ, the Vâ<i>ri</i>asaneyi-Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ, and the Taittirîya-Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ; the Sûtra of Gobhila, on the other hand, presupposes, beside the Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ of the Sâma-veda [^80], another collection of Mantras which evidently was composed expressly with the purpose of being used at G<i>ri</i>hya ceremonies: this collection is preserved to us under the title of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a, and it has been edited at Calcutta (1873), with a commentary and Bengali translation by Satyavrata Sâma<i>ri</i>ramin [^81].

Prof. Knauer of Kiew, to whom all students of the G<i>ri</i>hya literature are highly indebted for his very accurate edition and translation of Gobhila, has been the first to <span id="p4">[<sup><small>p. 4</small></sup>]</span> examine into the relation in which the two texts, the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a and the Gobhilîya-sûtra, stand to each other. He has very kindly enabled me to make use, before they were published, of the results of his investigations, which he has laid down in the introduction to his translation of Gobhila. While I wish, therefore, to acknowledge the obligation under which Prof. Knauer has thus laid me, I must try, on the other side, to state my own opinion as to the problem in question, which in some points differs from, or is even opposed to, the theory by which Prof. Knauer has tried to solve it.

To begin with that side of the question regarding which there can scarcely be any doubt: it is certain, I believe, that Gobhila supposes the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a to be known to the students of his Sûtra. The reasons which show this are obvious enough [^82]. By far the greater part of the Mantras of which Gobhila quotes the first words, are not found in the Sâma-veda nor, for the most part, in any other Vedic Sa<i>n</i>hitâ, except in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a, in which they stand in exactly the same order in which they are referred to by Gobhila. The descriptions of the G<i>n</i>hya sacrifices by Gobhila would have been meaningless and useless, and the sacrificer who had to perform his domestic ceremonies according to the ritual of Gobhila, would have been unable to do so, unless he had known those Mantras as contained in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a. And not only the Mantras, but also the order in which the Mantras stood, for Sûtras such as, for instance, Gobh. II, 1, 10 (‘With the two following verses he should wash,’ &c.), would have no meaning except for one who had studied the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a which alone could show which ‘the two following verses’ were.

There are, consequently, two possibilities: either the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a existed before the Gobhilîya-sûtra, or the two works have been composed together and on one common plan. It is the first of these alternatives which Prof. Knauer maintains; I wish, on the other hand, to call <span id="p5">[<sup><small>p. 5</small></sup>]</span> the attention of Vedic scholars to some facts which seem to me to render the second more probable.

A great part of the Mantras which have to be recited, according to Gobhila, at the performance of the G<i>ri</i>hya ceremonies, are not given in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a, but they are either found in the Sâma-veda-Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ and then their Pratîkas are quoted by Gobhila, or they are cited by Gobhila in extenso. Thus for the ceremonies described in the first Prapâ<i>ri</i>aka of Gobhila, such as the morning and evening offerings and the sacrifices of the full and new moon, the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a gives, with one single exception, no Mantras at all [^83]; but those Mantras, most of which consist only of a few words, are given by Gobhila only. It is scarcely to be believed that in a Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ which had to contain the Mantras required for the performance of the G<i>ri</i>hya sacrifices, the Mantras belonging to the two daily and the two fortnightly sacrifices, which occupy one of the first places among all G<i>ri</i>hya ceremonies and are treated of accordingly in all G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras, should have been omitted, unless that Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ was intended to stand in relation to another text by which that deficiency was supplied: and the Gobhilîya-sûtra exactly supplies it. Prof. Knauer thinks that those Mantras were omitted because they had already found their place in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual; but we must not forget that in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual o f the Sâma-vedins neither the Agnihotra nor the Dar<i>ri</i>apûr<i>ri</i>amâsa sacrifices, which are performed without the assistance of priests of the Udgât<i>ri</i> class, are treated of. Moreover the one Mantra to which we have already alluded [^84], the single one which corresponds in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a to the first book of Gobhila, seems to me quite sufficient to show that it was not the intention of the compiler of that text to disregard that group of sacrifices; he gave that Mantra only, because the other Mantras, consisting of but a few words, were given in extenso in the Gobhila text. The Mantra of which we speak, belongs to the description <span id="p6">[<sup><small>p. 6</small></sup>]</span> of the paryuksha<i>ri</i>a of the sacrificial fire. The sacrificer pours out water to the south, the west, and the north of the fire, with the Mantras, ‘Aditeऽnumanyasva,’ ‘Anumateऽnumanyasva,’ ‘Sarasvaty anumanyasva’; then he sprinkles water round the fire once or three times with a longer Mantra, ‘Deva Savita_h<i>ri</i>g_<i>ri</i>am prasuva ya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>apatim bhagâya. Divyo gandharva_h<i>ri</i>h<i>ri</i>m<i>ri</i>h_ punâtu. Vâ<i>ri</i>aspatir vâ<i>ri</i>a_m<i>ri</i>h_ svadatu.’ This last one is the Mantra given in its entirety in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a, while Gobhila [^85] has only the first words of it. To assume here that the author of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a knew only of that one Mantra, and that at the time of Gobhila the custom of the Sâma-vedins had undergone a change, so that they used four Mantras instead of the one, would be, in my opinion, an artificial and not very probable way of explaining the facts; a much more natural supposition would be, I believe, that the Sûtra and the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a describe one and the same form of the ceremony, so that the Brâhma<i>ri</i>a, by omitting the short Mantras, which were given in the Sûtra in their entirety, implicitly refers to the Sûtra, and the Sûtra, on the other hand, by quoting only the first words of the longer Mantra, refers to the Brâhma<i>ri</i>a in which the full text of that Mantra was given.

Among the numerous ceremonies described by Gobhila, which could furnish the occasion for similar remarks, we select only two: the rites performed in the evening of the wedding-day [^86], and the sacrifice on the full-moon day of Â<i>vayu</i>vayu<i>vayu</i>a [^87]. The bridegroom, having carried away his bride from her home, takes her to the house of a Brâhma<i>vayu</i>a, and when the stars have appeared, he makes six oblations with the six verses lekhâsandhishu pakshmasu (Mantra-Br. I, 3, 1-6): these are given in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>vayu</i>a, and Gobhila has only the Pratîka. Then follow two short Mantras: the bride, to whom the polar-star has been shown, addresses that star with the words: dhruvam asi dhruvâha<i>m</i> patikule bhûyâsam amushyâsâv iti; <span id="p7">[<sup><small>p. 7</small></sup>]</span> and when she sees the star Arundhatî, she says, ruddhâham asmi. As the full wording of these Mantras is given by Gobhila, they are omitted in the Brâhma<i>vayu</i>a. Finally the bridegroom recites over the bride the _Ri__k<i>vayu</i>ri_thivî, &c.; this we find in the M.-B. (I, 3, 7), the Pratîka only being quoted by Gobhila. If one were to suppose here that in the two texts two different stages in the development of this ceremony are represented, so that only the Mantras lekhâsandhishu and dhruvâ dyau<i>m</i> would belong to the more ancient form of it, while the Mantras dhruvam asi and ruddhâham asmi would have been introduced at a later time, it may perhaps not be possible to disprove, in the strictest sense of the word, such an opinion. But I think the data we have given point to another solution of the problem which, if not the only admissible, is yet the most probable and natural one. Gobhila gave the full wording of the shorter Mantras with which the description of the ceremony could be interwoven without becoming obscure or disproportionate; the longer Mantras would have interrupted, rather tediously and inconveniently, the coherency of his ritual statements; so he separated them from the rest of his work and made a separate Sa<i>vayu</i>hitâ of them. It is true that there are some exceptions to the rule that all long Mantras are given in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>vayu</i>a and all short Mantras only in the Sara: on the one hand, there are some Mantras of considerable extent that are given by Gobhila and omitted in the Brâhma<i>vayu</i>a, thus, for instance, the Mantra yady asi saumî used at a preparatory ceremony that belongs to the Pu<i>vayu</i>savana [^88]. On the other hand, a number of short Mantras which Gobhila gives in extenso, are found nevertheless also in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>vayu</i>a: such is the case, for instance, with many of the Mantras belonging to the worship of the Fathers, Gobhila IV, 2. 3, Mantra-Br. II, 3. <span id="p8">[<sup><small>p. 8</small></sup>]</span> It appears then, that allowance must be made for a certain inconsistency or carelessness in the distribution of the material between the two texts: and such an assumption will easily be allowed by any one who does not entertain very exaggerated ideas as to the care and reflection which presided over the composition of the Sûtra texts.

I will add only a few words concerning a second G<i>ri</i>hya ceremony, which calls for the same sort of comment as the rites which have just been discussed. For the offering on the day of the full moon, Gobhila prescribes (III, 8, 2) first the verse â no mitrâvaru<i>ri</i>â, second the verse mâ nastoke. The Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a (II, 1, 8) has the second of these verses only, not the first: conversely, the first verse alone, and not the second, is to be found in the Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ of the Sâma-veda (I, 220). We could hardly assume, as I think, that the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a presupposed another form of the rite differing from Gobhila's; we should be much more inclined to consider the leaving out of that matter, which was contained in other texts of the Sâma-veda, as a proof that the compiler of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a assumed that those texts were known [^89].

And this brings me to one of Prof. Knauer's conjectures concerning the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a which I have not yet touched. According to tradition we consider the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a as belonging to the Sâma-veda; in the Calcutta edition it is designated as the ‘Sâma-vedasya Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>am.’ Prof. Knauer thinks that it is doubtful whether the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a belonged to the Sâma-veda originally. He conjectures [^90] ‘that it existed already in the <span id="p9">[<sup><small>p. 9</small></sup>]</span> period during which the separate schools were as yet in the process of sifting, when there were as yet no Sâma-vedists in the later and stricter sense of the term [^91].’ For out of 249 Mantras of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a there are only four which are found in the Sâma-veda [^92], as Prof. Knauer has shown, while a much greater number of these Mantras. occur in the other Vedic Sa<i>n</i>hitâs. I should be inclined to conclude the other way: just because the author of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a presupposed a knowledge of the Sa<i>n</i>hitâ of the Sâma-veda, but not of the other Vedas—or in other words because he destined his work for Sâma-vedins, he did not need to repeat what was in the Sâma-veda, but was compelled to incorporate in his compilation the Mantras out of the <i>Ri</i>g-veda or of the Ya<i>n</i>ur-veda [^93]. Moreover, I would draw the same conclusions from the Mantras cited by Gobhila which are absent in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a, as I did from the Mantras which occur in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a, but are not to be found in the Sâma-veda. Those Mantras are all to be found in the Sâma-veda with the exception of those which Gobhila has in extenso, and which therefore could be omitted in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a. If we examine the thirteen Mantras collected by Prof. Knauer (p. 29), we find that in the case of nine of them the passage of the Sâma-veda (always of the first Âr<i>n</i>ika of the Sâma-veda) where they are to be found is quoted by Prof. Knauer.

<span id="p10">[<sup><small>p. 10</small></sup>]</span>

The four other cases are:

_ri_<i>k</i>a_m<i>k</i>g_âmahe, Gobh. III, 2, 48.

ta_k<i> </i>k_akshur devahitam, III, 8, 5.

sam anyâ yanti, III, 9, 7.

pra<i>g</i>âpataye, IV, 7, 36.

Of these Mantras the first is contained in the Sâma-veda (I, 369) just as the nine first-mentioned ones; the second is quoted by Gobhila in extenso; the third is to be found in the Âra<i>n</i>yaka division of the Sâma-veda I (vol. ii, p. 292, ed. Bibl. Ind.); in the fourth finally the text is corrupt; it is intended for the verse out of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a Pra<i>n</i>âpate na tvad etâny anya_h_. Thus the four apparent exceptions all vanish, and we have in the Mantras which are absent in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a a new proof that this text belongs to the literature of the Sâma-veda [^94].

Thus, according to my view, we may describe the origin of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a as follows. The Sâma-veda contained in its Sa<i>n</i>hitâ a much smaller number of Mantras applicable to the G<i>n</i>hya rites than either the <i>Ri</i>g-veda or the Ya<i>n</i>ur-veda; the peculiar character of the Sâman texts, intended for musical recitations at the most important sacrificial offerings, was quite remote from the character of formulas suitable for the celebration of a wedding, for the birth of a child, for the consecration of fields and flocks. Hence it is that, to a much greater extent than Â<i>n</i>valâyana or Pâraskara, Gobhila mentions Mantras for which a reference to the Sa<i>n</i>hitâ was not sufficient; and this led to the compiling of a separate Sa<i>n</i>hitâ of such G<i>n</i>hya-mantras, which presupposes the G<i>n</i>hya-sûtra, just as the latter presupposes this Sa<i>n</i>hitâ. The almost perfect agreement of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a with Gobhila furnishes a valuable <span id="p11">[<sup><small>p. 11</small></sup>]</span> warrant for the good preservation of the two texts; of small discrepancies I have noted only two: Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 6, 15, the formula âgantrâ samaganmahi is given for the ceremony of the Upanayana, while Gobhila does not prescribe this Mantra for this ceremony, although other G<i>n</i>hya texts do; and secondly, the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a II, 5, 1-7 does not consist of six verses as Gobh. IV, 6, 5-6 allows us to assume, but of seven verses.

In concluding this introduction notice is to be drawn to the fact that the text of Gobhila has preserved for us the traces of a division differing from the one into four Prapâ<i>th</i>akas which is handed down by tradition: in a number of places certain Sûtras or the last words of certain Sûtras are set down twice, a well-known way of indicating the close of a chapter. This repetition, besides occurring at the end of the first, third, and fourth Prapâ<i>th</i>aka (not at the end of the second), is to be found in the following places which become more frequent towards the close of the work: I, 4, 31; III, 6, 15; IV, 1, 22; 4, 34; 5, 34; 6, 16.

## Footnotes

[^80]: 3:1 The term ‘Sa<i>m</i>hitâ of the Sâma-veda’ ought to be understood here in its narrower sense as denoting the so-called first book of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, the _Kh<i>m</i>k_ika or collection of Yoni verses (see on the relation between this collection and the second book my remarks in the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, vol. xxxviii, pp. 464. seq.). Prof. Knauer in his list of the verses quoted by Gobhila (p. 29 of his translation of the Gobhilîya-G<i>m</i>hya) states that Sâma-veda II, 1138 (= I, 276) and 1139 is quoted in Gobhila III, 9, 6, but an accurate analysis of the words of Gobhila shows that the verse II, 1139 is not referred to, so that only the verse II, 1138 remains, which occurs also in the first book of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ. The ‘dvika’ of which Gobhila speaks in that Sûtra is not a dv<i>m</i><i>m</i>a, but, as the commentators rightly understand it (see Knauer's edition of the text, p. xii), it is a dyad of Sâmans or melodies, the two Kâvasha Sâmans which are based on the text I, 276, and are given in the great Sâma-veda edition of Satyavrata Sâma<i>m</i>ramin, vol. i, pp. 566, 567.

[^81]: 3:2 In the same way the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra of Âpastamba stands in connection with a similar collection of G<i>ri</i>hya verses and formulas, the Âpastambîya-Mantrapâ<i>ri</i>a.

[^82]: 4:1 Cf. Knauer's Introduction, pp. 24, 31 seq.

[^83]: 5:1 Cf. Knauer's translation, Introduction, p. 25.

[^84]: 5:2 Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 1, 1.

[^85]: 6:1 Gobh. I, 3, 4.

[^86]: 6:2 Gobh. II, 3, 17 seq.

[^87]: 6:3 Gobh. III, 8.

[^88]: 7:1 Gobh. II, 6, 7. It is possible, though we have no positive evidence for this conjecture, that such statements regarding preparatory or auxiliary ceremonies may here and there have been added to the Sûtra collection in a later time. The Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya (II, 2, 20) has instead of that long Mantra only a few words which in the Gobhilîya-sûtra stand at the end of it.

[^89]: 8:1 Any one who holds the view that the ritualistic formulas, which are not contained in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a, represent later extensions of the ceremonies in question, will do well to notice how in any one of the offerings of the <i>S</i>rauta ritual which we possess, both in the old description of the Sa<i>n</i>hitâ and Brâhma<i>n</i>a texts, and in the more recent description of the Sûtra texts, Mantras have been added in more recent times to the former ones. I think that it would be difficult to draw from such observations any argument of analogy calculated to support Dr. Knauer's opinion as to the relation of the Mantras in Gobhila and in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a.

[^90]: 8:2 Introduction to his translation, p. 23.

[^91]: 9:1 Besides the reasons given below in opposition to this conjecture, I may be permitted to point out that this hypothesis is contrary to the whole chronology of the G<i>ri</i>hya literature which we endeavoured to arrive at in the general introduction. It is a priori extremely improbable that there was a G<i>ri</i>hya Sa<i>ri</i>hitâ at a time when there was as yet no Sâma-veda.

[^92]: 9:2 Viz. (according to Prof. Knauer's alphabetical list of the Mantras of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a) ima<i>m</i> stomam arhate, M.-B. II, 4, s = Sv. I, 66; II, 414; tat savitur vare<i>n</i>yam, M.-B. I, 6, 29 = Sv. II, 812; bharâmedhmam, M.-B. II, 4, 3 = Sv. II, 415; <i>s</i>akema tvâ, M.-B. II, 4, 4 = Sv. II, 416.

[^93]: 9:3 Notice that of the four exceptional cases which we put together in the previous note, three cases are Mantras which are found only in the second Âr<i>k</i>ika of the Sâma-veda, not in the first (cf. above, [p. 3](#p3), note [^80]). The fourth verse (M.-B. II, 4, 2) is to be found in the first Âr<i>k</i>ika, it is true, but it stands closely related to two verses which are not to be found in that Âr<i>k</i>ika (M.-B. II, 4, 3. 4). This explains why it was put into the Mantra-Brâhma<i>k</i>a, as well as those two verses.

[^94]: 10:1 One will not object that the Mantras in question which are absent in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a are all to be found in the <i>Ri</i>g-veda as well as in the Sâma-veda. Since almost all the verses of the Sâma-veda are taken from the <i>Ri</i>g-veda there is nothing astonishing about this. Before one could conclude from this that the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a belongs to the <i>Ri</i>g-veda he would have to answer the question, How is it that the verses in question are always verses of the Rim veda which are repeated in the Sâma-veda? Why are there not among them verses which are not to be found in the Sâma-veda?
