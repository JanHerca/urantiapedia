GENERAL RULES OF THE SACRIFICE.

<span id="an1"></span>

## SÛTRA I.

We shall explain the sacrifice.

<span id="an1c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Ya<i>g</i><i>g</i>a, sacrifice, is an act by which we surrender something for the sake of the gods. Such an act must rest on a sacred authority (âgama), and serve for man's salvation (_s_reyoऽrtha). The nature of the gift is of less importance. It may be puro<i>g</i>â<i>g</i>a, cake; karu, pulse; sâ<i>g</i>nâyya, mixed milk; pa<i>g</i>u, an animal; soma, the juice of the Soma-plant, &c.; nay, the smallest offerings of butter, flour, and milk may serve for the purpose of a sacrifice.

Ya<i>g</i><i>g</i>a, yâga, ya<i>g</i>ana, and ish<i>g</i>i are considered as synonymes.

<span id="an2"></span>

## SÛTRA II.

The sacrifice is for the three colours or castes (var<i>n</i>a), for Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Râ<i>n</i>anyas, also for the Vai<i>n</i>ya.

<span id="an2c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Though the sacrifice is meant for the three castes, here called var<i>n</i>a, i.e. colour, the third caste, that of the Vai<i>n</i>ya or citizen, is mentioned by itself, while the two castes, the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Râ<i>n</i>anyas (the Kshatriyas or nobles), are mentioned together. This is done because there are certain sacrifices (bahuya<i>n</i>amâna), performed by Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Râ<i>n</i>anyas together, in which Vai<i>n</i>yas take no part. In the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-sûtras, I, 1, 3, also <span id="p316">[<sup><small>p. 316</small></sup>]</span> the Vai<i>n</i>ya is mentioned by himself. In Kâtyâyana's Sûtras, however, no such distinction is made. and we read, I, 6, Brâhma<i>n</i>a-râ<i>n</i>anya-vai<i>n</i>yânâ_m<i>n</i>s<i>n</i>h_. Women, if properly married, are allowed to participate in sacrifices, but no one is allowed to be accompanied by a Sûdrâ woman, even though she be his wife. Properly a Brâhma<i>n</i>a should marry a wife of his own caste only. A Kshatriya may marry a woman of his own or of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a caste. A Vai<i>n</i>ya's proper wife should be taken from his own caste. See, however, Manu III, 12 seq.

The four castes, with the <i>S</i>ûdra as the fourth, are mentioned once in the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, X, yo, 12. The opposition between Âryas and <i>S</i>ûdras occurs in the Atharva-veda, XIX, 62, &c., and in most of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. In the <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a we read of the four castes, Brâhma<i>n</i>a, Râ<i>n</i>anya, Vai<i>n</i>ya, and <i>S</i>ûdra, and we are told that none of them vomits the Soma. Kâtyâyana excludes from the sacrifice the aṅgahîna, cripple, sha<i>nd</i>a, eunuch, and all a<i>n</i>rotriyas, persons ignorant of the Veda, which would bar, of course, the whole class of the <i>S</i>ûdras, but they are also specially excluded. Concessions, however, had to be made at an early time, for instance, in the case of the Rathakâra, who is admitted to the Agnyâdhâna, &c. This name means chariot-maker, but Âpadeva, in his Mîmâ<i>n</i>sâ-nyâya-prakâ<i>n</i>a, remarks that, though rathakâra means a chariot-maker etymologically, it should be taken here as the name of a clan, namely that of the Saudhanvanas (MS. Mill 46, p. 13b). Deva, in his commentary on the Kâtyâyana-sûtras, makes the same remark. See also Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 12 seq. These Saudhanvanas, often identified with the _Ri_bhus, are evidently the followers of B<i>n</i>bu, mentioned RV. VI, 45, 31; 33, and wrongly called B<i>n</i>dhu in Manu X, 107; see M.M., Hist. of A.S.L., p. 494. In the _S<i>n<i>S</i>rauta-sûtras, XVI, 11, 11 (ed. Hillebrandt), he is rightly called B<i>n</i>bu. In later times Rathakâra is the name of a caste, and its members are supposed to be the offspring of a marriage between a Mâhishya and a Kara<i>n</i>î. A Mâhishya is the son of a Kshatriya and a Vai<i>n</i>yâ, <span id="p317">[<sup><small>p. 317</small></sup>]</span> a Kara<i>n</i>î the daughter of a Vai<i>n</i>ya and a <i>S</i>ûdrâ. Sudhanvan also is used in Manu X, 23, as the name of a caste, namely the offspring of fallen (vrâtya) Vai<i>n</i>yas.

Another exception is made in favour of a Nishâdasthapati, a Nishâda chieftain. If it meant a chieftain of Nishâdas, it might be meant for a Kshatriya who happens to be a chieftain of Nishâdas. Here it is meant for a chieftain who is himself a Nishâda, a native settler. He is admitted to the Gavedhuka sacrifice.

Again, although, as a rule, the sacrificer must have finished his study of the Veda and be married, a sacrifice is mentioned which a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, a student, may perform. The case thus provided for is, yo brahma<i>k</i>ârî striyam upeyât, sa gardabham pa<i>k</i>um âlabheta. As these sacrificers are not upanîta, and therefore without the sacred fires, their sacrifices have to be performed with ordinary fires, and the sacrificial offerings, the puro<i>k</i>â<i>k</i>as, are not cooked in kapâlas, jars, but on the earth, while the avadânas (cuttings), heart, tongue, &c., are sacrificed in water, and not in fire. The Nishâda chieftain has to learn the necessary Vedic verses by heart, without having passed through a regular course of Vedic study. The same applies to women, who have to recite certain verses during the sacrifice.

That certain women are admitted to the sacrifice, is distinctly stated by Kâtyâyana, I, 1, 7, strî kâvi<i>s</i>eshât.

<span id="an3"></span>

## SÛTRA III.

The sacrifice is prescribed by the three Vedas.

<span id="an3c"></span>

**Commentary.**

In order to know the whole of the sacrifice, one Veda is not sufficient, still less one sâkhâ (recension) only. The sacrifice is conceived as a whole, and its members (aṅgas) are described in different parts of the three Vedas.

<span id="an4"></span>

## SÛTRA IV.

By the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, the Sâma-veda (is the sacrifice prescribed). <span id="p318">[<sup><small>p. 318</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an5"></span>

## SÛTRA V.

The Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsau, the new and full-moon sacrifices, are prescribed by the <i>Ri</i>g-veda and the Ya<i>s</i>ur-veda.

<span id="an6"></span>

## SÛTRA VI.

The Agnihotra is prescribed by the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda.

<span id="an7"></span>

## SÛTRA VII.

The Agnish<i>t</i>oma is prescribed by all.

<span id="an7c"></span>

**Commentary.**

By saying all, the Atharva-veda is supposed to be included, at least according to one commentator.

The Agnish<i>t</i>oma requires sixteen priests, the Pa<i>t</i>u sacrifices six, the <i>K</i>âturmâsyas five, the Dar<i>t</i>a-pûr<i>t</i>amâsas four.

<span id="an8"></span>

## SÛTRA VIII.

With the <i>Ri</i>g-veda and Sâma-veda the performance takes place with a loud voice (u<i>k</i><i>k</i>ai<i>h</i>).

<span id="an8c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Even lines of the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, if they are contained in the <i>Ri</i>g-veda and Sâma-veda, would have to be pronounced with a loud voice. Certain mantras, however, are excepted, viz. the <i>g</i>apa, abhimantra<i>g</i>a, and anumantra<i>g</i>a-mantras.

<span id="an9"></span>

## SÛTRA IX.

With the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda the performance takes place by murmuring (upâ<i>g</i><i>g</i>u).

<span id="an9c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This murmuring, upâ<i>m</i><i>m</i>u, is described as a mere opus operatum, the words being repeated without voice and without thought. One may see the movements of the vocal organs in murmuring, but one should not hear them at a distance. If verses from the <i>Ri</i>g-veda or Sâma-veda <span id="p319">[<sup><small>p. 319</small></sup>]</span> occur in the Ya<i>m</i>ur-veda, they also have to be murmured. See Kâty. I, 3, 10.

<span id="an10"></span>

## SÛTRA X.

With the exception of addresses, replies, choosing of priests (pravara), dialogues, and commands.

<span id="an10c"></span>

**Commentary.**

As all these are meant to be understood by others, they have therefore to be pronounced in a loud voice. The address (â<i>s</i>ruta) is o_m<i>s</i>s_râvaya; the reply (pratyâ<i>s</i>ruta) is astu _s<i>s</i>t_ [^796]; the choosing of priests (pravara) is agnir devo hotâ; a dialogue (sa<i>s</i>vâda) is brahman prokshishyâmi, om proksha; a command (sampresha) is proksha<i>s</i>îr âsâdaya.

<span id="an11"></span>

## SÛTRA XI.

In the Sâmidhenî hymns the recitation is to be between (the high and the low tone).

<span id="an11c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Sâmidhenîs are the hymns used for lighting the fire. One commentator explains antarâ, between, as between high tone (krush<i>t</i>a) and the murmuring (upâ<i>t</i><i>t</i>u). Another distinguishes three high tones, the krush<i>t</i>a (also called târa or krau<i>t</i><i>t</i>a), the madhyama, and the mandra, and assigns the madhyama to the Sâmidhenî hymns. The mandra notes come from the chest, the madhyama notes from the throat, the uttama notes from the head.

<span id="an12"></span>

## SÛTRA XII.

Before the Â<i>yabhâgas (such as the Â</i>yabhâgas (such as the Â<i>yabhâgas (such as the Â</i>ya-portions at the Dar<i>yabhâgas (such as the Â</i>a-pûr<i>yabhâgas (such as the Â</i>amâsa), and at the morning Savana (oblation of Soma), the recitation is to be with the soft (mandra) voice. <span id="p320">[<sup><small>p. 320</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an12c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The pronunciation is loud, u<i>k</i><i>k</i>ai_h_, but soft, mandra. Satyavrata restricts this rule to the passages mentioned in Sûtra X. He also treats the second part of Sûtras XII, XIII, and XIV as separate Sûtras.

<span id="an13"></span>

## SÛTRA XIII.

Before the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t (at the Dar<i>t</i>a-pûr<i>t</i>amâsa) sacrifice, and at the midday Savana, the recitation is to be with the middle voice.

<span id="an14"></span>

## SÛTRA XIV.

In the remainder and at the third Savana with the sharp (krush<i>t</i>a) voice [^797].

<span id="an14c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The remainder refers to the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice, the three Savanas to the Soma sacrifice. Satyavrata takes all these rules as referring to the cases mentioned in Sûtra X.

<span id="an15"></span>

## SÛTRA XV.

The movement of the voice is the same.

<span id="an15c"></span>

**Commentary.**

In the three cases mentioned before, the voice moves quickly, when the words are to be pronounced high; slowly, when low; and measuredly, when neither loud nor low.

<span id="an16"></span>

## SÛTRA XVI.

The Hot_ri_\-priest performs with the <i>Ri</i>g-veda.

<span id="an17"></span>

## SÛTRA XVII.

The Udgât_ri_\-priest with the Sâma-veda. <span id="p321">[<sup><small>p. 321</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an18"></span>

## SÛTRA XVIII.

The Adhvaryu-priest with the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda.

<span id="an19"></span>

## SÛTRA XIX.

The Brahma-priest with all.

<span id="an19c"></span>

**Commentary.**

‘With all’ means with the three Vedas, because the Brahma-priest, or superintendent of the whole sacrifice, must be acquainted with the three Vedas. Others would include the Atharva-veda.

<span id="an20"></span>

## SÛTRA XX.

When it is expressly said, or when it is rendered impossible, another priest also may act.

<span id="an20c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Vipratishedha is explained by asambhava and a<i>s</i>akti.

<span id="an21"></span>

## SÛTRA XXI.

The priestly office (ârtvi<i>g</i>ya) belongs to the Brâhma<i>g</i>as.

<span id="an21c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Sacrifices may be performed for Kshatriyas, Vai<i>s</i>yas, and, in certain cases, even for others, but never by any but Brâhma<i>s</i>as. The reason given for this is curious,—because Brâhma<i>s</i>as only are able to eat the remains of a sacrifice. See <i>S</i>atap. Br. II, 3, 1, 39; Kâtyâyana IV, 14, 11; also I, 2, 8, cont.

<span id="an22"></span>

## SÛTRA XXII.

For all sacrifices the fires are laid once.

<span id="an22c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The sacrificial fires have to be arranged for the first time <span id="p322">[<sup><small>p. 322</small></sup>]</span> by a peculiar ceremony, called the Agnyâdhâna. They are generally three (Tretâ), the Gârhapatya, the father; the Dakshi<i>n</i>a, the son; and the Âhavanîya, the grandson. The first laying of the Gârhapatya fire-altar takes place in spring for a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, in summer for a Râ<i>n</i>anya, in winter for a Vai<i>n</i>ya.

<span id="an23"></span>

## SÛTRA XXIII.

If it is said, <i>g</i>uhoti, ‘he sacrifices,’ it should be known that sarpir â<i>g</i>ya, melted butter, is meant.

<span id="an23c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Sarpis is here taken as an adjective, running; yad asarpat tat sarpir abhavat. Â<i>ya is explained as navanîtavikâradravya</i>ya is explained as navanîtavikâradravya<i>ya is explained as navanîtavikâradravya</i>âtîyava<i>ya is explained as navanîtavikâradravya</i>ana_h<i>ya is explained as navanîtavikâradravya</i>h_, i.e. a word signifying any kind of substance made of fresh butter.

In the Aitareya-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 3, we read â<i>n</i>ya_m<i>n</i>m_ surabhi, gh<i>n</i>tam manushyâ<i>n</i>âm, ayutam pit<i>nd</i>âm, navanîta_m<i>n</i>n_âm, ‘Â<i>n</i>ya is sweet or fragrant to the gods, gh<i>n</i>ta to men, ayuta to the manes, navanîta to children.’ Here the commentator explains that â<i>n</i>ya is butter, when melted (vilîna<i>m</i> sarpis), gh<i>n</i>ta, when hardened. Ayuta, sometimes called astu, is butter, when slightly melted, nishpakva, when thoroughly melted. According to Kâtyâyana I, 8, 37, â<i>n</i>ya is of different kinds. It may be simple gh<i>n</i>ta, which, as a rule, should be made of the milk of cows. But in the absence of â<i>n</i>ya, the milk of buffaloes (mâhisha), or oil (taila), or sesam-oil (_g_ârtila), or linseed oil (atasîsneha), &c., may be taken.

<span id="an24"></span>

## SÛTRA XXIV.

If it is said, <i>g</i>uhoti, it should be known that the Adhvaryu is meant as performer.

<span id="an24c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Though there is a man who offers the sacrifice, yet the actual homa, the throwing of butter &c. into the fire, has to be performed by the Adhvaryu priest. <span id="p323">[<sup><small>p. 323</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an25"></span>

## SÛTRA XXV.

Likewise, the spoon (_g_uhû) as the vessel.

<span id="an25c"></span>

**Commentary.**

<i>G</i>uhû, the spoon, is so called because it is used for pouring out (_g_uhoti, homa).
