## SÛTRA LXXVI.

The Ash<i>t</i>â-kapâla for Agni, the Ekâda<i>t</i>a-kapâla or Dvâda<i>t</i>a-kapâla for Indra-Agnî, form the principal acts at the Amâvâsyâ, the new moon, in the case of one who does not sacrifice with Soma.

<span id="an77"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXVII.

In the case of one who sacrifices with Soma, the second principal act is the Sâ<i>m</i>nâyya (both at the full-moon and new-moon sacrifices).

<span id="an77c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Sâ<i>m</i>nâyya is a mixture of dadhi and payas, sour and sweet milk, and is intended for Indra or Mahendra [^798]. It takes the place of the second Puro<i>m</i>â<i>m</i>a at the new-moon sacrifice.

<span id="an78"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXVIII.

In the case of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, who does not sacrifice with Soma, the Agnîshomîya cake is omitted.

<span id="an78c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This rule does not seem to be accepted by all schools. It is not found in Kâtyâyana, and Hira<i>n</i>yake<i>n</i>in observes: Nâsomayâ<i>n</i>ino brâhma<i>n</i>asyâgnîshomîya_h<i>n</i>d<i>n</i>s_o vidyata ity ekeshâm. See Hillebrandt, l.c. p. iii.

<span id="an79"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXIX.

Without distinction of caste, the Aindrâgna offering is omitted for one who offers the Sâ<i>m</i>nâyya.

<span id="an79c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Even though he be not a Somayâ<i>g</i>in, says the commentary.

<span id="p338"><sup><small>[ p. 338 ]</small></sup></span>

This whole matter is summed up in Kapardin's commentary: Amâvâsyâyâm asomayâ<i>g</i>ina aindrâgna-sâ<i>g</i>nâyyayor vikalpa_h_. Paur<i>g</i>amâsyâ_m<i>g</i>g<i>g</i>n<i>g</i>h_. Tadrahitâpi paur<i>g</i>amâsî purushârtha<i>m</i> sâdhayati. Tatra dvayor eva hi yâgayo_h<i>g</i>n<i>g</i>s<i>g</i>k_yatvam asti, pratyeka<i>m</i> nâmayogât. Tasmâd agnîshomîyayâgarahitâv evetarau purushârtha_m<i>g</i>h_.

<span id="an80"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXX.

The Pit_ri_\-ya<i>g</i><i>g</i>a, the sacrifice to the fathers, is not Aṅga (auxiliary) because its own time is prescribed.

<span id="an80c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The text should be pit<i>ri</i>ya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a_h<i>ri</i>h_ syât. This sacrifice for the Manes, called also the Pi<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a-pit<i>ri</i>ya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a, falls under the new-moon sacrifice, but is to be considered as a pradhâna, a primary sacrifice, not as an aṅga, a member of the Dar<i>ri</i>a.

<span id="an81"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXI.

Also, because it is enumerated like the Dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice.

<span id="an81c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This refers to such passages from the Brâhma<i>n</i>as as: There are four great sacrifices, the Agnihotram, the Dar<i>n</i>apûr<i>n</i>amâsau, the <i>K</i>âturmâsyâni, and the Pi<i>nd</i>a-pit<i>n</i>ya<i>nd</i>a_h_.

<span id="an82"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXII.

Also, because, when the Amâvâsyâ sacrifice is barred, the Pit<i>ri</i>ya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a is seen to take place.

<span id="an83"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXIII.

A principal act (pradhâna) is accompanied by auxiliary acts (aṅga). <span id="p339"><sup><small>[ p. 339 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an83c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This Sûtra forms sometimes part of the preceding Sûtra, and would then refer to the Pit<i>ri</i>ya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a only.

<span id="an84"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXIV.

A principal act is what has its own name, and is prescribed with special reference to place, time, and performer.

<span id="an84c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This Sûtra is sometimes divided into two; the first, dese kâle kartarîti nirdi<i>s</i>yate, the second, asva<i>s</i>abda<i>m</i> yat. The following are given as illustrations. If it is said that ‘he should sacrifice with the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva on a slope inclined to the East,’ we have the locality. If it is said that ‘he should sacrifice with the Vâ<i>s</i>apeya in autumn,’ we have the time. If it is said that ‘the sacrificer himself should offer the Agnihotra on a parvan (change of the moon),’ we have the performer. In each of these cases, therefore, the prescribed sacrificial act is a pradhâna sâṅgam, a principal act with auxiliary members.

<span id="an85"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXV.

The Darvi-homa (libation from a ladle) stands by itself.

<span id="an85c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Apûrva is explained by the commentator, not in its usual sense of miraculous, but as not being subject to the former regulations.

<span id="an86"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXVI.

They are ordered by the word <i>g</i>uhoti, he pours out.

<span id="an87"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXVII.

They are offered with the word Svâhâ.

<span id="an87c"></span>

**Commentary.**

According to Kâtyâyana I, 2, 6-7, the <i>g</i>uhotis are <span id="p340"><sup><small>[ p. 340 ]</small></sup></span> offered sitting, the ya<i>g</i>atis standing. See Sûtra XCII. The <i>g</i>uhoti acts consist in pouring melted butter into the fire of the Âhavanîya altar, which is so called because ‘âhûyanteऽsminn âhutaya<i>h</i> kshipyanta iti.’

<span id="an88"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXVIII.

Taking (the butter) once.

<span id="an89"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXXIX.

Or, if there are several Âhutis, taking (the butter) for each Âhuti.

<span id="an90"></span>

## SÛTRA XC.

Or, doing as he likes in dividing (the butter).

<span id="an90c"></span>

**Commentary.**

These three Sûtras belong together. They teach that one slice (avadâna) of butter should be taken, melted, and poured on the Âhavanîya fire; or, if there are more than one âhuti, then one slice should be taken for each. This, however, is made optional again by the last Sûtra.

<span id="an91"></span>

## SÛTRA XCI.

There is no fuel (in the Darvi-homa), except at the Agnihotra.

<span id="an91c"></span>

**Commentary.**

In the case of the Agnihotra it is distinctly stated, dve samidhâv âdadhyât, let him lay down two sticks.

<span id="an92"></span>

## SÛTRA XCII.

One pours out (_g_uhoti) the Darvi-homas, sitting west of the Âhavanîya fire, and bending the right knee, or not bending it.

<span id="an93"></span>

## SÛTRA XCIII.

If it is distinctly stated, it is done in a different way. <span id="p341"><sup><small>[ p. 341 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an93c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The vidhi, contained in Sûtra XCII, is therefore called autsargika, general, and liable to exceptions, as when it is said, that he turns to the east.

<span id="an94"></span>

## SÛTRA XCIV.

One pours out (_g_uhoti) all âhutis, west of the Âhavanîya fire, passing (the altar) southward, and then turning to the north.

<span id="an95"></span>

## SÛTRA XCV.

The Â<i>s</i>ruta and Pratyâ<i>s</i>ruta, the Yâ<i>s</i>yâ and Anuvâkyâ, the Upastara<i>s</i>a and Abhighâra<i>s</i>a, with the slicings, the _K<i>s</i>ri_hîta also, and the Vasha<i>s</i>kâra constitute the Darvi-homas.

<span id="an95c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Â<i>ruta is â </i>ruta is â <i>s</i>râvaya; the Pratyâ<i>ruta is â </i>ruta, astu _s<i>ruta is â </i>t_; Anuvâkyâ and Yâ<i>ruta is â </i>yâ are verses, the first inviting the deity, the second accompanying the sacrifice. Whenever vegetable, animal, or sâ<i>ruta is â </i>nâyya offerings have to be. sliced, upastara<i>ruta is â </i>a, spreading, and abhighâra<i>ruta is â </i>a, sprinkling with fat, take place. With â<i>ruta is â </i>ya offerings there is _K<i>ruta is â </i>ri_hîta (taking four times), and the Vasha<i>ruta is â </i>kâra.

<span id="an96"></span>

## SÛTRA XCVI.

With âhutis one should let the act (the pouring out) take place after the Vasha<i>t</i>kâra has been made, or while it is being made.

<span id="an96c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Vasha<i>t</i>kâra consists in the word Vasha_t_, to be uttered by the Hot_ri_\-priest. The five sacrificial interjections are, svâhâ, srausha_t_, vausha_t_, vasha_t_, and svadhâ.

<span id="an97"></span>

## SÛTRA XCVII.

With the Grahas the act should be made to coincide with the Upayâma. <span id="p342"><sup><small>[ p. 342 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an97c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Grahas are offerings of Soma, and likewise the vessels (kamasa) in which the Soma is offered. The Soma is offered with the words upayâma-g<i>ri</i>hîtoऽsi, and while these words are being uttered, the fluid should be poured out (dhârâ<i>m</i> srâvayet).

<span id="an98"></span>

## SÛTRA XCVIII.

With the Ish<i>t</i>akâs, the act should be made to coincide with the words tayâ deva tena.

<span id="an98c"></span>

**Commentary.**

When the different ish<i>t</i>akâs or bricks are placed together for building an altar, &c., the act itself begins with the first and ends with the last words of the accompanying verse.

<span id="an99"></span>

## SÛTRA XCIX.

When there is a number of Puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>as, one should slice off one after another, saying for each portion vyâvartadhvam (separate)!

<span id="an99c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>a is a cake made of meal (pakva_h<i>d</i>t<i>d</i>n_<i>d</i>a<i>h</i>), different from karu, which is more of a pulse consisting of grains of rice or barley, and clarified butter (gh<i>d</i>tata<i>d</i><i>d</i>ulobhayâtmakam). This puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>a cake has to be divided for presentation to different deities. If there are more than two deities, the plural vyâvartadhvam, separate, has to be used.

<span id="an100"></span>

## SÛTRA C.

When the two last are sliced off, he should say for each portion, vyâvartethâm, separate ye two!

<span id="an100c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Each slice, avadâna, is said to be about a thumb's breadth. In the case of sâ<i>m</i>nâyya, the mixture of sour and sweet milk, a kind of coagulated sour milk, each portion is to be of the same breadth, but, as it is fluid, it is <span id="p343"><sup><small>[ p. 343 ]</small></sup></span> taken out with a ladle (sruva) of a corresponding size; see Kâtyâyana I, 9, 7.

## Footnotes

[^798]: 337:1 Vaidya in his Dictionary explains it, however, as any substance mixed with clarified butter and offered as a burnt offering, which can hardly be right.
