## PRAPÂ_TH_AKA II, KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 1.

1\. [^185] Under a propitious Nakshatra let him take a wife—

2\. [^186] Who should possess the auspicious characteristics in due way.

3\. If he can find no such (woman, he should take) earth-clods—

4\. [^187] From an altar, a furrow, a pool, a cow-stable, a place where four roads meet, a gambling-place, a place where corpses are burnt, and from sterile soil;

5\. A ninth (earth-clod) mixed of all.

6\. (These he should make) equal (and should) make marks at them.

7\. [^188] Taking them in his hand he should offer them to the girl, and (reciting the formula): ‘Right alone is the first; right nobody oversteps; on right this earth is founded. May N.N. become this universe!’—he should pronounce her name and should say: ‘Take one of these.’

8\. If she takes one of the first four (clods), he should marry her, <span id="p43">[<sup><small>p. 43</small></sup>]</span>

9\. [^189] And according to some (teachers) also, if (she takes) the mixed one.

10\. [^190] After she has been washed with Klîtaka, barley and beans, a friend should besprinkle her three times at her head, so that her whole body becomes wet, with Surâ of first quality, with (the formula), ‘Kâma! I know thy name. Intoxication thou art by name,’ &c. (Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 1, 2). (In the passage of the formula), ‘Bring hither N.N.,’ he should pronounce the husband's name. (The Mantras should have) the word Svâhâ at their end. With the two following verses he should wash her private parts.

11\. That has to be done by (female) relatives (of the bride).

12\. At the wedding wood has been put on the fire to the east of the house, on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung).

13\. [^191] Then one of the people who assist at the wedding, fills a cup with ‘firm’ water, and having walked with the water-pot round the fire on its front side, silent, wrapped in his robe, he stations himself to the south (of the fire), facing the north

14\. Another person with a goad (walks in the same way and stations himself in the same place). <span id="p44">[<sup><small>p. 44</small></sup>]</span>

15\. They place roasted grain mixed with _S_amî leaves, to the amount of four handfuls, in a winnowing basket behind the fire,

16\. And an upper mill-stone.

17\. [^192] Now (the girl) whose hand he is going to seize, has been washed, (her whole body) including her head.

18\. The husband should put on her a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, with the verse, ‘They who spun’ (Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 1, 5), and with (the verse), ‘Put on her, dress her’ (l.l. 6).

19\. Leading forward (from the house to the sacred fire, the bride) who is wrapped in her robe and wears the sacrificial cord over her left shoulder, he should murmur (the verse), ‘Soma gave her to the Gandharva’ (MB. I, 1, 7).

20\. [^193] While she, to the west of the fire, pushes forward with her foot a rush-mat or something else of that kind, veiled (with clothes), he should make her say: ‘May the way which my husband goes, be open to me.’

21\. If she does not murmur (these words out of shame, &c.), he should murmur (them, saying), ‘To her’ (instead of ‘To me’).

22\. She should make the end of the rush-mat (Sûtra 20) reach the end of the Barhis.

23\. On the east end of the rush-mat she sits down to the right of the bridegroom. <span id="p45">[<sup><small>p. 45</small></sup>]</span>

24\. [^194] While she touches his right shoulder with her right hand, he sacrifices six oblations of Â<i>g</i>ya with (the verse), ‘May Agni go as the first,’ and the following (verses) (MB. I, 1, 9-14)—

25\. And (three oblations) with the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, one by one;

26\. A fourth with (the four Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis) together.




## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 2.

1\. [^195] After the sacrifice they both arise.

2\. The husband passes behind her back, stations himself to the south, with his face turned to the north, and seizes the woman's joined hands.

3\. [^196] (Standing) to the east (of the girl) her mother or her brother, having taken the roasted grain, should make the bride tread on the stone with the tip of her right foot.

4\. The bridegroom murmurs: ‘Tread on this stone’ (MB. I, 2, 1).

5\. Her brother filling once his joined hands with roasted grain, pours it into the bride's joined hands.

6\. [^197] After (Â<i>g</i>ya) has been spread under and poured over (the fried grain), she sacrifices that in the fire without opening her joined hands, with (the verse which the bridegroom \[?\] recites), ‘This woman says’ (MB. I, 2, 2).

7\. [^198] (The verses), ‘The god Aryaman,’ and, ‘Pûshan’ <span id="p46">[<sup><small>p. 46</small></sup>]</span> (l.l. 3. 4) (are repeated) at the two following (oblations of fried grain).

8\. [^199] After that sacrifice the husband, passing (behind her back), returns in the same way, and leads her round the fire so that their right sides are turned towards it, or a Brâhma<i>n</i>a versed in the Mantras (does the same), with (the verse), ‘The maid from the fathers’ (MB. I, 2, 5).

9\. After she has thus been lead round, she stands as before (Sûtras 1. 2), and treads (on the stone) as before (Sûtra 3), and he murmurs the (Mantra) as before (Sûtra 4), and (her brother) pours (the fried grain into her hands) as before (Sûtra 5), and she sacrifices as before (Sûtra 6).

10\. In the same way three times.

11\. After (she) has poured the remnants (of the fried grain) into the fire, they make (her) step forward in a north-easterly direction with (the formula), ‘For sap with one step’ (MB. I, 2, 6. 7).

12\. She should put forward her right foot (first) and should follow with the left.

13\. (The bridegroom) should say (to her), ‘Do not put the left (foot) before the right.’

14\. [^200] The lookers-on he should address with (the verse), ‘Auspicious ornaments wears this woman’ (I. 1. 8).

15\. [^201] To the west of the fire the water-carrier follows (their way) and besprinkles the bridegroom on his forehead, and also the other one (i.e. the bride), <span id="p47">[<sup><small>p. 47</small></sup>]</span> with this verse (which the bridegroom murmurs), ‘May (the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs) anoint (or, unite)’ (l.l. 9).

16\. After she has been (thus) besprinkled, he puts up her joined hands with his left hand, seizes with his right hand her right hand with the thumb, her hand being turned with the palm upwards, and murmurs these six verses referring to the seizing of (a girl's) hand, ‘I seize thy hand’ (MB. I, 2, 10-15).

17\. When (these verses) are finished, they carry her away—





## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 3.

1\. [^202] To a convenient house of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, which is situated in a north-easterly direction.

2\. There wood has been put on the (nuptial) fire.

3\. [^203] To the west of the fire a red bull's hide has been spread out, with the neck to the east and with the hair outside.

4\. On that they make the woman, who has to keep silence, sit down.

5\. And (there) she remains sitting until the stars appear.

6\. When (somebody) has said that a star has appeared, (the husband) sacrifices six oblations of Â<i>g</i>ya with the (six verses) commencing with (the verse), ‘In the junctions of the lines’ (l.l. I, 3, 1-6).

7\. The remnants of each oblation he should pour out over the bride's head.

8\. After the sacrifice they arise, go out (of the house), and he shows her the ‘firm star’ (i.e. the polar-star). <span id="p48">[<sup><small>p. 48</small></sup>]</span>

9\. (Repeating the formula): ‘Firm art thou. May I, N.N., become firm in the house of N.N., my husband’—she should pronounce her husband's and her own name.

10\. [^204] And (he shows her besides the star) Arundhatî.

11\. [^205] (She says): ‘I (N.N.) am held fast,’ &c., as above (Sûtra 9).

12\. He then addresses her with the verse, ‘Firm is the sky’ (MB. I, 3, 7).

13\. [^206] After she has been addressed (thus), she respectfully calls her Guru by his Gotra name.

14\. [^207] Thus she breaks her silence.

15\. From that time through a period of three nights they should both avoid eating saline or pungent food, and should sleep together on the ground without having conjugal intercourse.

16\. [^208] Here, they say, an Argha reception (should be offered to the young husband).

17\. Some say (that this reception should be offered) when (the bridegroom and his companions) have arrived (at the house of the bride's father).

18\. [^209] The first food which he eats, should be food <span id="p49">[<sup><small>p. 49</small></sup>]</span> fit for sacrifice, over which he has murmured (the verses quoted in Sûtra 21).

19\. Or he should prepare on the following day a mess of cooked food, of which they eat together.

20\. The deities to whom it belongs, are, Agni, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the Vi<i>g</i>ve devâs, and Anumati.

21\. Having taken that food out (of the vessel in which it is), and having spread it out, he should touch one part of it with his hand, with (the verses), ‘With the tie of food, with the jewel’ (MB. I, 3, 8-10).

22\. [^210] After he has eaten, and has given the rest to the wife, (they may do) what they like.

23\. [^211] A cow is the sacrificial fee.




## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 4. [^212]

1\. When she mounts the chariot, let him murmur the verse, ‘Adorned with Ki<i>m</i><i>m</i>uka flowers, of _S_almali wood’ (MB. I, 3, 11).

2\. [^213] On the way he should address crossways, rivers and unevennesses (of the soil), big trees, and burial grounds, with (the verse), ‘May no waylayers meet us’ (ibid. 12).

3\. [^214] If the axle breaks, or something that is bound gets loose, or if the chariot is overturned, or if some other accident happens, they should put wood on the fire which they carry with themselves, should <span id="p50">[<sup><small>p. 50</small></sup>]</span> make oblations (of Â<i>ri</i>ya) with the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis, should procure a new piece (instead of that which has been damaged), and should besmear it with the remnants of the Â<i>ri</i>ya (that has been offered), with (the verse), ‘He who without binding’ (Sâma-veda I, 244).

4\. Having sung the Vâmadevya, he should mount (again).

5\. When they have arrived, the Vâmadevya (is sung).

6\. When (the bride) has reached the house, Brâhma<i>n</i>a women of good character, whose husbands and sons are living, make her descend (from the chariot), and make her sit down on a bull's hide with (the verse which the husband recites), ‘Here, ye cows, bring forth calves’ (MB. I, 3, 13).

7\. They should place a boy in her lap.

8\. [^215] Into the joined hands of that (boy) they should throw lotus-roots (?),

9\. Or fruits.

10\. [^216] After she has made that boy rise, she sacrifices the eight ‘firm’ Â<i>g</i>ya oblations with (the formula), ‘Here is steadiness’ (MB. I, 3, 14).

11\. When she has finished, she puts a piece of wood (on the fire) and respectfully salutes the Gurus, according to seniority, with their Gotra names. Then they may do what they like.

15\. Pressing them down with his left hand, and seizing with his right hand the razor of Udumbara wood or the mirror, he touches with it (the Darbha blades), with the (Mantra), ‘Axe! Do no harm to him!’ (ibid. 6).

16\. With (the Mantra), 'With which Pûshan has shaven B<i>ri</i>haspati's head' (ibid. 7), he moves forward (that razor or the mirror) three times towards the east without cutting (the hair); once with the Ya<i>ri</i>us, twice silently. <span id="p62">[<sup><small>p. 62</small></sup>]</span>

17\. Then (the barber) with the razor of metal cuts the hair and throws (the cut off hair ends) on the bull's dung.

18\. In the same way (after the same rites have been performed), he cuts the patch of hair on the back-side;

19\. And that on the left side.

20\. [^246] He should repeat (when going to cut the hair on the back-side, and then again on the left side, the rites stated above), beginning from the moistening of the hair (Sûtra 12).

21\. Grasping with his two hands (the boy) round his head he should murmur (the verse), ‘The threefold age of _G_amadagni’ (MB. I, 6, 8).

22\. In the same way (the rites are performed) for a girl,

23\. (But) silently.

24\. [^247] The sacrifice, however, (is performed) with the Mantra.

25\. [^248] Walking away from the fire in a northerly direction they have the arrangement of (the boy's) hair made according to the custom of his Gotra and of his family.

26\. They throw the hair on the bull's dung (mentioned above), take it to the forest, and bury it.

27\. Some throw them on a bunch (of grass or the like). <span id="p63">[<sup><small>p. 63</small></sup>]</span>

28\. Then they may do what they like.

29\. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.



## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 10.

1\. [^249]  [^250] In the eighth year after the conception let him initiate a Brâhma<i>n</i>a,

2\. In the eleventh year after the conception a Kshatriya,

3\. In the twelfth year after the conception a Vai<i>s</i>ya.

4\. Until the sixteenth year the time has not passed for a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, until the twenty-second for a Kshatriya, until the twenty-fourth for a Vai<i>n</i>ya.

5\. [^251] After that (time has passed), they become patitasâvitrîka (i.e. they have lost their right of being taught the Sâvitrî).

6\. Let them not initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform sacrifices for them, nor form matrimonial alliances with them.

7\. On the day on which the youth is going to receive the initiation, on that day, early in the morning, they give him to eat, and have his hair arranged, and wash him, and deck him with ornaments, and put on him a (new) garment which has not yet been washed. <span id="p64">[<sup><small>p. 64</small></sup>]</span>

8\. [^252] Their garments are made of linen, of hempen cloth, of cotton, or of wool (according to the caste to which the student belongs).

9\. The skins (which they wear), are an antelope-skin, or the skin of a spotted deer, or a goat's skin.

10\. [^253] Their girdles are made of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a grass, of Kâ<i>ñ</i>a grass, of Tâmbala.

11\. Their staffs are of Par<i>n</i>a wood, of Bilva wood, of A<i>n</i>vattha wood.

12\. The garment of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a is made of linen, or of hempen cloth, that of a Kshatriya, of cotton, that of a Vai<i>n</i>ya, of wool.

13\. [^254] Thereby also the other articles have been explained.

14\. Or if (the proper articles prescribed) cannot be got, all (of them may be used) by (persons of) all castes.

15\. [^255] To the east of the house on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung) wood has been put on the fire.

16\. Having sacrificed with (the Mantras which the student recites) ‘Agni! Lord of the vow’ (MB. I, 6, 9-13), the teacher stations himself to the west <span id="p65">[<sup><small>p. 65</small></sup>]</span> of the fire, on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.

17\. Between the fire and the teacher the student (stands), raising his joined hands, turning his face towards the teacher, on northward-pointed Darbha grass.

18\. Standing on his south side a Brâhma<i>n</i>a versed in the Mantras fills (the student's) joined hands with water,

19\. And afterwards (those) of the teacher.

20\. Looking (at the student the teacher) murmurs (the verse), ‘With him who comes to us, we have come together’ (MB. I, 6, 14).

21\. He causes (the student) to say, ‘I have come hither to studentship’ (ibid. 16).

22\. [^256] In (the words), ‘What is thy name’ (ibid. 17), he asks after his name.

23\. The teacher chooses for him a name which he is to use at respectful salutations,

24\. (A name) derived from (the name of) a deity or a Nakshatra,

25\. Or also of his Gotra, according to some (teachers).

26\. Having let the water run out of his joined <span id="p66">[<sup><small>p. 66</small></sup>]</span> hands (over the student's hands), the teacher with his right hand seizes (the student's) right hand together with the thumb, with (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god Savit_ri_, with the arms of the two A<i>s</i>vins, with Pûshan's hands I seize thy hand, N.N.!' (ibid. 18).

27\. He then makes him turn round from left to right with (the formula), 'Move in the sun's course after him, N.N.!' (ibid. 19).

28\. Grasping down with his right hand over his right shoulder he should touch his uncovered navel with (the formula), ‘Thou art the knot of all breath’ (ibid. 20).

29\. Raising himself (from the position implied in Sûtra 28, he should touch) the place near the navel with (the formula), ‘Ahura’ (ibid. 21).

30\. Raising himself (still more, he should touch) the place of the heart with (the formula), ‘K<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>ana’ (ibid. 22).

31\. Having touched from behind with his right hand (the student's) right shoulder with (the formula), ‘I give thee in charge to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, N.N.!’ (ibid. 23)—

32\. And with his left (hand) the left (shoulder) with (the formula), ‘I give thee in charge to the god Savit_ri_, N.N.!’ (ibid. 24)—

33\. [^257] He then directs him (to observe the duties of Brahma<i>k</i>arya, by the formula), ‘A student art thou, N.N.!’ (ibid. 25).

34\. ‘Put on fuel. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time’ (ibid. 26).

35\. Having gone in a northerly direction from <span id="p67">[<sup><small>p. 67</small></sup>]</span> the fire, the teacher sits down to the east, on northward-pointed Darbha grass,

36\. The student to the west, bending his right knee, turning his face towards the teacher, also on northward-pointed Darbha grass.

37\. (The teacher) then ties round (the student) thrice from left to right the girdle made of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a grass and causes him to repeat (the verse), ‘Protecting us from evil word’ (ibid. 27), and (the verse), ‘The protectress of right’ (ibid. 28).

38\. Then (the student) respectfully sits down near (the teacher) with (the words), ‘Recite, sir! May the reverend one recite the Sâvitrî to me.’

39\. He then recites (the Sâvitrî, ibid. 29) to him, Pâda by Pâda, hemistich by hemistich, and the whole verse,

40\. And the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis one by one, with the word Om at the end (ibid. 30).

41\. And handing over to him the staff, which should be made of (the wood of) a tree, he causes him to repeat (the formula), ‘O glorious one, make me glorious’ (ibid. 31).

42\. Then (the student) goes to beg food,

43\. First of his mother, and of two other women friends, or of as many as there are in the neighbourhood.

44\. He announces the alms (received) to his teacher.

45\. The rest of the day he stands silently.

46\. After sunset he puts a piece of wood on the fire with (the Mantra), ‘To Agni I have brought a piece of wood’ (ibid. 32).

47\. Through a period of three nights he avoids eating pungent or saline food. <span id="p68">[<sup><small>p. 68</small></sup>]</span>

48\. At the end of that (period) a mess of boiled rice-grains (is offered) to Savit_ri_.

49\. [^258] Then he may do what he likes.

50\. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.

End of the Second Prapâ<i>th</i>aka.

## Footnotes

[^185]: 42:1 1, 1-4. Description of the wedding. Comp. Indische Studien, V, 288, 305 seq.; 312 seq.; 368 seq.

[^186]: 42:2 In translating ku<i>s</i>alena I have been guided by the comparison of I, 5, 26 (comp. Böhtlingk-Roth, s.v. ku<i>s</i>ala). The commentary understands the Sûtra in a different way. He should take a woman who possesses auspicious characteristics commended by one versed (ku<i>s</i>ala) in the characteristics of women. If he can find no such person who is able to judge, he should, &c. (Sûtra 3).

[^187]: 42:4 Comp. Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 5, 5; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 21-23.

[^188]: 42:7 Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya, l.l. § 4.

[^189]: 43:9 See Sûtra 5.

[^190]: 43:10 ‘With Klîtaka,’ &c., means, with water into which Klîtaka, &c., has been thrown; comp. G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 15. ‘Surâ of first quality’ is Surâ prepared from molasses; see G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 16. Comp., however, also G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 41.

[^191]: 43:13 Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 3, 5; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 25. 26. ‘Firm water’ seems to be water which does not dry up. The G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha says: ‘Water that has its smell, its colour, and its taste, which is in great rivers, in wells and other receptacles, and in ponds: such water is called “firm;” this is the fixed meaning.’ Comp. Bloomfield's note, Z.D.M.G. XXXV, 574.

[^192]: 44:17 17-19. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 3, 6. Ya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>opavîtinîm in Sûtra 19 means, according to the commentary, that she wears her outer garment arranged like the sacrificial cord, over her left shoulder; for women are not allowed to wear the sacrificial cord itself.

[^193]: 44:20 G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 27 seq.

[^194]: 45:24 24-26. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 3, 11-13.

[^195]: 45:1 2, 1 seqq. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 3,16 seqq.

[^196]: 45:3 The roasted grain is that mentioned chap. 1, 15, the stone, Sûtra 16.

[^197]: 45:6 Comp. G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 34.

[^198]: 45:7 On the repetitions of the lâ<i>g</i>âhoma, see below, Sûtras 9. 10.

[^199]: 46:8 As to the words ‘in the same way,’ see the second Sûtra of this chapter.

[^200]: 46:14 14-16. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 3, 27-31.

[^201]: 46:15 Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 12, 5 note (vol. xxix, p. 33) The water-carrier is the person mentioned chap. 1, 13.

[^202]: 47:1 3, 1 seqq. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4, 1 seqq.

[^203]: 47:3 This is the standing description of the bull's hide used at the <i>S</i>rauta or G<i>ri</i>hya ceremonies; comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 16, 1 note.

[^204]: 48:10 Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 7, 22.

[^205]: 48:11 The play on words (Arundhatî—ruddhâ) is untranslatable.

[^206]: 48:13 ‘Her Guru’ means, according to the commentary, her husband. The commentary quotes the well-known sentence: patir eko guru_h<i> strî</i>n_âm. Perhaps we may also take the Guru for the Brâhma<i> strî</i>a in whose house they stay. Comp. also chap. 4, 11.

[^207]: 48:14 Comp. above, Sûtra 4.

[^208]: 48:16 16, 17. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4, 7. 8. Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 12, to note. The Gobhila commentary states that this Argha reception should be offered by the bride's father. On the different opinions of the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana commentaries see the note quoted.

[^209]: 48:18 Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4, 10.

[^210]: 49:22 Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4, 11. 14.

[^211]: 49:23 Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4, 6.

[^212]: 49:4 The way of the bridegroom with the bride to their new home, and their arrival.

[^213]: 49:2 Perhaps a part of this Sûtra is based on a half Sloka, the two parts of which have been transposed in the prose version, mahâv<i>ri</i>kshân _s<i>ri</i>s<i>ri</i>m<i>ri</i>k<i>ri</i>s<i>ri</i>k<i>ri</i>n<i>ri</i>k_a.

[^214]: 49:3 Comp. Pâraskara I, 10.

[^215]: 50:8 The explanation of _s<i>akalo</i>t<i>akalo</i>s_âlûka is doubtful. Prof. Weber believes that we ought to read _s<i>akalo</i>t_ân (lumps of dung); see Indische Studien, V, 371.

[^216]: 50:10 ‘Firm’ oblations seem to mean oblations by which the wife obtains a firm abode in her husband's house. Comp. Indische Studien, V, 376.

[^217]: 51:1 5, 1. The _K_aturthîkarman.

[^218]: 51:2 2, 3. Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 18, 3; Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4, 12.

[^219]: 51:4 I.e. instead of prâya<i>s</i><i>s</i>itte (expiation) he uses the plural prâya<i>s</i><i>s</i>ittaya_h_; and he says, ‘you are the expiations of the gods,’ &c.

[^220]: 51:6 Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4,13. Hrâsayitvâ literally means, ‘having shortened her.’ She is ‘shortened’ by the removing of the substance with which they have besmeared her (hrâsayitvâ udvartanâdinâ tad abhya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>anam apanîya, says the commentary). Comp. on the technical meaning of hrâsana the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 38, 8-10; Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 4, 15. 16.

[^221]: 52:1 6, 1 seq. The Pu<i>m</i>savana. Khâdira-G<i>m</i>hya II, 2, 17 seq. On âdisade<i>m</i>e the commentary says, âdisade<i>m</i>e âdisamîpaprade<i>m</i>e prathame t<i>m</i>tîyabhâge, ity etat. âdimade<i>m</i>a iti pâ<i>m</i>e vyakta evârtha_h_. To me it seems probable that âdimade<i>m</i>e is the true reading.

[^222]: 52:7 The first Mantra consists of seven sections; with each of p. 53 these sections he should, according to the commentary, give three barley corns or beans to the owner of the Nyagrodha tree, or put them down at the root of the tree.

[^223]: 54:1 7, 1. seq. The Sîmantakara<i>n</i>a or Sîmantonnayana. Khâdira-G<i>n</i>hya II, 2, 24 seq.

[^224]: 54:3 This Sûtra is identical with chap. 6, 2.

[^225]: 54:4 _s<i>alâ</i>t_ugrathnam should be emended, in my opinion, so as to read salâ<i>alâ</i>ugrapsam. Comp. Pâraskara I, 15, 4: yugmena sa<i>alâ</i>âlugrapsenaudumbare<i>alâ</i>a. Â<i>alâ</i>valâyana I, 14,4: yugmena _s<i>alâ</i>t_uglapsena. Hira<i>alâ</i>yake<i>alâ</i>in II, 1: salâtugrapsam upasa<i>alâ</i>g<i>alâ</i>hya.

[^226]: 55:13 13 seq. The soshyantîhoma. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 2, 28 seq.

[^227]: 55:17 17 seq. Ceremonies for the new-born child (_G_âtakarman). Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 2, 32 seq.

[^228]: 55:18 See above, chap. 6, 9.

[^229]: 56:19 Comp. above, chap. 6, 11.

[^230]: 56:23 The impurity (a<i>s</i>au<i>s</i>a) of the mother lasts through ten days after her confinement; comp. the note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>s</i>hya I, 25, 1 (vol. xxix, p. 51).

[^231]: 56:1 8, 1 seq. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 3, 1 seq.

[^232]: 57:6 I am not sure about the meaning of prathamoddish<i>t</i>a eva. I have translated according to the commentary, which has the following note: prathamoddish<i>t</i>a eva prathama_m<i>t</i>h<i>t</i>t<i>t</i>h<i>t</i>h<i>t</i>ri_tîyâyâm ity etat.—The commentary then mentions a reading prathamodita eva, in which udita may either be derived from vad or from ud-i.

[^233]: 57:8 8 seq. The Nâmakara<i>n</i>a. Khâdira-G<i>n</i>hya. II, 3, 6 seq.

[^234]: 57:10 10, 11. Comp. above, Sûtras 2. 3.

[^235]: 58:12 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 25, 5. In the same G<i>ri</i>hya the enumeration of the Nakshatras with their presiding deities is given, I, 26.

[^236]: 58:14 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 24, 4; Â<i>ri</i>valâyana I, 15, 4; Pâraskara I, 17, 2. In the text read dîrghâbhinish<i>ri</i>ânânta_m<i>ri</i>th<i>ri</i>m_.

[^237]: 58:19 Monthly sacrifice in commemoration of the child's birth. Possibly we should translate: Every month (after the birth) of the boy, through one year (comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 25, 10. 11), or on the Parvan days, &c.

[^238]: 59:20 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 25, 6.

[^239]: 59:21 21 seq. The father's returning from a journey. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 3,13 seq. As to upeta, comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, I, 1 note. The position of the words in Sûtra 21 is irregular, so as to raise the suspicion that the words yadâ vâ. . . . upetasya vi (‘or when the son begins to know . . . has been initiated’) are an insertion into the text of Gobhila, made by a later compiler, or into a more ancient text, made by Gobhila himself. Comp. Pâraskara I, 18.

[^240]: 59:25 As to the repetition of the last words of this Sûtra, see the notes on I, 4, 31; II, 10, 50; III, 6, 15.

[^241]: 60:1 9, 1. The _K<i>û</i>d<i>û</i>n_a. Khâdira-G<i>û</i>hya II, 3, 16 seq. On the literal meaning of _K<i>û</i>d_âkarana, see <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 28, 1 note.

[^242]: 60:2 Comp. above, II, 1, 13.

[^243]: 60:5 Comp. above, chap. 7, 9; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 39.

[^244]: 60:6 I believe that four vessels were filled, one with rice, one with barley, one with sesamum seeds, and one with beans. The Dvandva compounds vrîhiyavais and tilamâshais cannot justify the conclusion that one vessel was filled with rice and barley mixed, and another with sesamum seeds and beans, for the plural pâtrâ<i>n</i>i shows that there were more than two vessels. Â<i>n</i>valâyana I, 17, 2, says, vrîhiyavamâshatilânâ_m<i>n</i>ri<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>s<i>n</i>n_i.

[^245]: 61:11 I have translated the Mantra according to the reading of Â<i>ri</i>valâyana (G<i>ri</i>hya I; 17, 6) and Pâraskara (II, 1, 6): ush<i>ri</i>ena Vâya udakenehi. Gobhila has udakenaidhi.

[^246]: 62:20 Thus on the back-side seven Darbha blades are put into the hair, and on the left side seven. This makes, together with the seven blades put into the hair on the right side (Sûtra 14), twenty-one, the number stated in Sûtra 4.

[^247]: 62:24 In the description of the Kû<i>âkara</i>âkara<i>âkara</i>a given in this chapter no sacrifice is mentioned. See, however, I, 9, 28.

[^248]: 62:25 G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 40.

[^249]: 63:1 10, 1 seq. The initiation of the student. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 4, 1 seq.

[^250]: 63:4 1-4. On the number of years given for the Upanayana of persons of the three castes, see the note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, I, 1.

[^251]: 63:5 5, 6. See the note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, I, 9.

[^252]: 64:8 There are four kinds of garments indicated, though only persons of three castes are concerned. The explanation of this apparent incongruence follows from Sûtra 12.

[^253]: 64:10 Tâmbala is stated to be a synonym for _s<i>a</i>n_a (hemp).

[^254]: 64:13 As the garments indicated in Sûtra 8 belong, in the order in which they are stated, to persons of the three castes respectively, thus also of the skins (Sûtra 9), of the girdles (Sûtra 10), and of the staffs (Sûtra 11); the first is that belonging to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the second, to a Kshatriya, and the third, to a Vai<i>n</i>ya.

[^255]: 64:15 Comp. above, chap. 9, 2.

[^256]: 65:22 22, 23. It is evident that the words tasyâ<i>k</i>ârya<i>h</i> belong to Sûtra 23, and not to Sûtra 22, to which the traditional division of the Sûtras assigns them. The corresponding section of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>k</i>a runs thus: ‘What is thy name?’—‘My name is N.N.!’ It is not clear whether the student, being questioned by the teacher, had to indicate his ordinary name, and then to receive from the teacher his ‘abhivâdanîya nâmadheya,’ or whether he had to pronounce, on the teacher's question, directly the abhivâdanîya name chosen for him by the teacher. The commentary and the corresponding passage of the Khâdira-G<i>k</i>hya (II, 4, 12) are in favour of the second alternative.

[^257]: 66:33 33, 34. Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 4, 5 note.

[^258]: 68:49 49, 50. Dr. Knauer very pertinently calls attention to the fact that these Sûtras are not repeated, as is the rule with regard to the concluding words of an Adhyâya or Prapâ<i>th</i>aka. Comp. chap. 8, 25 note.
