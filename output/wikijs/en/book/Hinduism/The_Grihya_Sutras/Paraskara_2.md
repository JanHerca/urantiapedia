## KÂ_N__D_A II, KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 1.

1\. [^756]. When (the son) is one year old, the _K<i>û</i>d<i>û</i>n_a (i.e. the tonsure of his head, should be performed),

2\. Or before the lapse of the third (year).

3\. When he is sixteen years old, the Ke<i>s</i>ânta (i.e. the shaving of his beard, is to be done),

4\. Or, according as it is considered auspicious by all (the different families).

5\. After food has been distributed to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, the mother takes the boy, bathes him, puts on him an under and an upper garment which have not yet been washed, and putting him on her lap, she sits down to the west of the fire.

6\. The father taking hold (of his wife) sacrifices Â<i>g</i>ya oblations, and after he has partaken of the (sacrificial) food, he pours warm water into cold water with (the words), ‘With warm water come hither, Vâyu! Aditi, cut the hair.’

7\. At the Ke<i>s</i>ânta ceremony (Sûtra 3), ‘hair and beard’ (instead of ‘hair’).

8\. He throws a piece of fresh butter, or of ghee, or some curds into it (i.e. into the water, Sara 6).

9\. [^757]. Taking some (water) he moistens the hair near the right ear with (the formula), ‘On the impulse of Savit<i>ri</i> may the divine waters moisten <span id="p302"><sup><small>[ p. 302 ]</small></sup></span> thy body in order that long life and splendour may be thine.’

10\. [^758]. Having unravelled (the hair) with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, he puts three young Ku<i>s</i>a shoots into it with (the formula), ‘Herb’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>s</i>h. IV, 1).

11\. [^759]. Taking up a copper razor with (the formula), ‘Friendly by name’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. III, 63 a), he cuts (the hair) with (the formula), ‘I cut off’ (ibid. 63b), (and with the formula,) ‘The razor with which Savit_ri_, the knowing one, has shaven (the beard) of king Soma and Varu<i>m</i>a, with that, ye Brâhma<i>m</i>as, shave his (head), in order that he may be blessed with long life and may reach old age.’

12\. Cutting off (the Ku<i>s</i>a shoots) together with the hair, he throws them on a lump of bull's dung which they keep northwards of the fire.

13\. In the same way two other times silently.

14\. The moistening and the other rites are repeated with the two other (tufts of hair).

15\. Behind with (the verse), ‘The threefold age’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. III, 62).

16\. [^760]. Then on the left side with (the verse), ‘With that prayer by which mayst thou, a mighty one, go to heaven, and long mayst thou see the sun: with that prayer I shave thee for the sake of life, of existence, of glory, of welfare.’ <span id="p303"><sup><small>[ p. 303 ]</small></sup></span>

17\. Three times he shaves round the head, from left to right;

18\. Including the face, at the Ke<i>s</i>ânta ceremony.

19\. [^761]. (He recites the verse,) ‘When the shaver shaves his hair with the razor, the wounding, the well-shaped, purify his head, but do not take away his life.’

20\. [^762]. He adds (the word), ‘his face’ at the Ke<i>s</i>ânta ceremony.

21\. With that water (Sûtras 6, 8) he moistens his head, and gives the razor to the barber with (the words), ‘Without wounding him, shave him.’

22\. The locks of hair which are left over, are to be arranged as it is considered auspicious (in his family).

23\. [^763]. Having put away that lump of dung with the hair so that it is hidden in a cow-stable, or in a small pond, or in the vicinity of water; he gives an optional gift to the teacher;

24\. A cow at the Ke<i>s</i>ânta ceremony.

25\. After the Ke<i>s</i>ânta has been performed, (the youth) should observe chastity and should not be shaven through one year, or twelve nights, or six nights, or at least three nights.

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 2.

1\. He should initiate a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, when he is eight years old, or in the eighth year after the conception,

2\. Â<i>s</i>valâyana, when he is eleven years old, <span id="p304"><sup><small>[ p. 304 ]</small></sup></span>

3\. A Vai<i>s</i>ya, when he is twelve years old.

4\. Or according as it is considered auspicious by all (the different families).

5\. He should feed the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. And they lead him (i.e. the boy who is to be initiated) on, with his head shaven all round, and decked with ornaments.

6\. [^764]. (The teacher) makes him place himself to the west of the fire and say, ‘I have come hither for the sake of studentship (brahma<i>k</i>arya).’ And, ‘I will be a student (brahma<i>k</i>ârin).’

7\. He then makes him put on a garment with (the verse), ‘In the way in which B<i>ri</i>haspati put the garment of immortality on Indra, thus I put (this garment) on thee, for the sake of long life, of old age, of strength, of splendour.’

8\. [^765]. He ties round him the girdle with (the verse which the youth recites), ‘Here has come to me, keeping away evil words, purifying my kind as a purifier, clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, with strength, this sisterly goddess, this blessed girdle.’

9\. [^766]. Or, ‘A youth, well attired, dressed, came hither. He, being born, becomes glorious. Wise sages extol him, devout ones, turning their minds to the gods.’

10\. Or silently.

11\. He gives him the staff. <span id="p305"><sup><small>[ p. 305 ]</small></sup></span>

12\. (The student) accepts it with (the verse), ‘My staff which fell down to the ground in the open air, that I take up again for the sake of long life, of holiness, of holy lustre.’

13\. [^767]. According to some (teachers he accepts the staff) in the way prescribed for the inauguration, because it is said, ‘He enters upon a long Sattra (or sacrificial period).’

14\. (The teacher) then with his joined hands fills (the student's) joined hands with water with the three (verses), ‘Ye waters are’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XI, 50 seqq.).

15\. [^768]. He then makes him look at the sun with (the verse), ‘That eye’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXXVI, 24).

16\. [^769]. He then touches his heart, (reaching) over his right shoulder, with (the words), ‘Into my will I take thy heart, &c.’

17\. [^770]. He then seizes (the student's) right hand and says, 'What is thy name?

18\. He replies, ‘I am N.N., sir!’

19\. He then says to him, ‘Whose pupil (brahma<i>k</i>ârin) art thou?’

20\. [^771]. After (the student) has said, ‘Yours!’—(the <span id="p306"><sup><small>[ p. 306 ]</small></sup></span> teacher replies,) 'Indra's pupil art thou; Agni is thy teacher; I am thy teacher, N.N.!’

21\. He then gives him in charge to living beings with (the formulas), ‘To Pra<i>g</i>âpati I give thee in charge. To the god Savit<i>ri</i> I give thee in charge. To the waters, the herbs I give thee in charge. To Heaven and Earth I give thee in charge. To the Vi<i>g</i>ve devâs I give thee in charge. To all beings I give thee in charge for the sake of freedom from harm.’

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 3.

1\. [^772]. Having walked round the fire with his right side turned towards it, he sits down.

2\. Taking hold (of the student), he sacrifices the Â<i>g</i>ya oblations, and after having partaken (of the remains of the sacrificial food) he instructs him, ‘A student art thou. Take water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time. Keep silence. Put fuel on (the fire). Take water.’

3\. He then recites the Sâvitrî to him, who is seated to the north of the fire, with his face to the west, sitting near the teacher, and looks (at the teacher), while (the teacher) looks at him;

4\. [^773]. Some say, to (the student) who is standing or seated to the south (of the fire);

5\. Pâda by Pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, and the third time the whole (verse), reciting it together (with the student); <span id="p307"><sup><small>[ p. 307 ]</small></sup></span>

6\. After one year, or after six months, or after twenty-four days, or after twelve days, or after six days, or after three days.

7\. [^774]. To a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, however, he should recite a (Sâvitrî) verse in the Gâyatrî metre immediately. For it is said in the <i>S</i>ruti, ‘To Agni indeed belongs the Brâhma<i>n</i>a.’

8\. A Trish<i>t</i>ubh verse to a Râ<i>t</i>anya,

9\. A <i>G</i>agatî to a Vai<i>s</i>ya,

10\. Or a Gâyatrî to (persons of) all (castes).

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 4.

1\. Now the putting on of fuel.

2\. [^775]. He wipes with his hand (the ground) round the fire with (the formula), ‘Agni, glorious one, make me glorious. As thou, glorious Agni, art glorious, thus, O glorious one, bring me to glory. As thou, Agni, art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of the Veda for men.’

3\. [^776]. Having sprinkled (water) round the fire from left to right, he stands up and puts a piece of wood on (the fire) with (the texts),

‘To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great <i>G</i>âtavedas. As thou, Agni, art inflamed by wood, thus I am inflamed by life, insight, vigour, offspring, cattle, holy lustre.

‘May my teacher be the father of living sons; may I be full of insight, not forgetful (of what I have learned); may I become full of glory, of splendour, of holy lustre, an enjoyer of food. Svâhâ! <span id="p308"><sup><small>[ p. 308 ]</small></sup></span>

4\. In the same way (he puts on) a second (piece of wood); and thus a third.

5\. Or (each piece) with (the verse), ‘Thine is this’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 14).

6\. Or (he uses) both (this verse and the formulas given in Sûtra 3).

7\. [^777]. The wiping and sprinkling (of water) round (the fire are repeated) as above.

8\. Having warmed his two hands, he wipes his mouth with (the formulas):

‘Agni, thou art the protector of bodies. Protect my body. Agni, thou art the giver of life. Give me life. Agni, thou art the giver of vigour. Give me vigour.

‘Agni, what is deficient in my body, that restore to fulness.

‘May the god Savit<i>ri</i> bestow insight on me, may the goddess Sarasvatî, may the two divine A<i>s</i>vins, wreathed with lotus, (bestow) insight (on me).’

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 5.

1\. Here (follows the student's) going the rounds for alms.

2\. [^778]. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a should beg, addressing (the woman from whom he begs alms) with the word ‘Lady’ put at the beginning (of his request),

3\. A Râ<i>g</i>anya, with the word ‘Lady’ inserted in the middle,

4\. A Vai<i>s</i>ya, with the word ‘Lady’ put at the end.

5\. [^779]. (He should beg) from three women who will not refuse; <span id="p309"><sup><small>[ p. 309 ]</small></sup></span>

6\. From six, twelve, or an indefinite number.

7\. From his own mother first, according to some (teachers).

8\. [^780]. Having announced the alms received to his teacher, he should stand, keeping silence, through the rest of the day, according to some.

9\. [^781]. Having fetched fire-wood out of the forest without damaging (trees), he should put them on that fire as above, and should abandon his silence.

10\. He should sleep on the ground and eat no pungent or saline food.

11\. Wearing the staff, worshipping the fire, being obedient to his Guru, going the rounds for alms—(these are the standing duties of students).

12\. [^782]. He should avoid honey or flesh, bathing (for pleasure), sitting on high seats, going to women, falsehood, and taking what is not given to him.

13\. [^783]. Let him live forty-eight years as a student for the (four) Vedas,

14\. Or twelve years for each Veda,

15\. Or until he has learnt it.

16\. The garment (of a student) should be made of hemp, flax, or wool (accordingly as he is a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, a Kshatriya, or a Vai<i>n</i>ya).

17\. The upper garment of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a should be an antelope-skin,

18\. That of a Râ<i>g</i>anya the skin of a spotted deer, <span id="p310"><sup><small>[ p. 310 ]</small></sup></span>

19\. That of a Vai<i>g</i>ya a goat's or cow's skin.

20\. Or if (the prescribed sort of garment) is not to be had, a cow's hide (should be worn) by all, because to that belongs the first place (among all kinds of garments).

21\. The girdle of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a should be of Mu<i>nd</i>a grass,

22\. That of a Kshatriya should be a bowstring,

23\. That of a Vai<i>s</i>ya, made of Mûrvâ (i.e. Sanseveria Roxburghiana).

24\. [^784]. If there is no Mu<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a (or the other articles prescribed in §§ 22, 23, the girdles should be made) of Ku<i>ñ</i>a grass, of the plant A<i>ñ</i>mantaka, or of Balba<i>ñ</i>a grass (respectively).

30\. If (the teacher calls him) while he is lying down, (he should answer) sitting; if sitting, standing; if standing, walking up (to the teacher); if walking up, running up.

31\. If he behaves thus, his fame when he has become a Snâtaka (i.e. when he has taken the bath at the end of his studentship) will be (such that people will say of him), ‘To-day he stays there; to-day he stays there.’

32\. [^785]. There are three (kinds of) Snâtakas: a Vidyâ-snâtaka (i.e. a Snâtaka by knowledge), a Vrata-snâtaka <span id="p311"><sup><small>[ p. 311 ]</small></sup></span> (i.e. a Snâtaka by the completion of his vows), and a Vidyâ-vrata-snâtaka (i.e. a Snâtaka both by knowledge and by the completion of his vows).

33\. He who performs the Samâvartana ceremony, after having finished the study of the Veda, but before the time of his vows has expired, is a Vidyâ-snâtaka.

34\. He who performs the Samâvartana, after his vows have expired, but before he has finished the study of the Veda, is a Vrata-snâtaka.

35\. He who performs the Samâvartana, after having finished both, is a Vidyâ-vrata-snâtaka.

36\. [^786]. Until the sixteenth year the time (for being initiated) has not passed for a Brâhma<i>n</i>a,

37\. Until the twenty-second for a Râ<i>g</i>anya,

38\. Until the twenty-fourth for a Vai<i>s</i>ya.

39\. After that (time has passed), they become patitasâvitrîka (or persons who have lost the right of learning the Sâvitrî).

40\. No one should initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform sacrifices for them, nor have intercourse with them.

41\. [^787]. After the time has passed, (they should do) as has been prescribed.

42\. [^788]. A person whose ancestors through three generations have been patitasâvitrîkas, is excluded <span id="p312"><sup><small>[ p. 312 ]</small></sup></span> from the sacrament (of initiation) and from being taught the Veda.

43\. [^789]. Of such persons those who desire to receive the sacrament, may perform the sacrifice of Vrâtyastoma and then study the Veda, if they like. For (of persons who have done that) it is said, ‘Intercourse with them is permitted.’

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 6.

1\. When he has finished the Veda, he should take the bath (by which he becomes a Snâtaka);

2\. [^790]. Or when (he has gone through) a studentship of forty-eight years;

3\. [^791]. Or also after (a studentship) of twelve years, according to some (teachers).

4\. (Let him take the bath only) if his Guru has given his permission.

5\. [^792]. Rules (regarding the performance of sacrifices), (texts) to be used (at the sacrifices according to those rules), and reasoning (on the meaning of the rites and texts): that is the Veda.

6\. [^793]. Some say (that the Veda should be studied) with its six Aṅgas; <span id="p313"><sup><small>[ p. 313 ]</small></sup></span>

7\. Not so that he only knows the ceremonial.

8\. But optionally by one who knows the sacrifices (the bath may be taken).

9\. (The student) after having embraced (the feet of) his teacher, and put the pieces of wood on the fire, places himself northwards of an enclosure, on eastward-pointed Ku<i>s</i>a grass, to the east of eight vessels with water.

10\. [^794]. ‘The fires that dwell in the waters; the fire which must be hidden, the fire which must be covered, the ray of light, the fire which kills the mind, the unwavering one, the pain-causing one, the destroyer of the body, the fire which kills the organs—those I leave behind. The shining one, that I seize here’—with (this formula) he draws water out of one (of the eight vessels);

11\. With that he besprinkles himself with (the words), ‘Therewith I besprinkle myself for the sake of prosperity, of glory, of holiness, of holy lustre.’

12\. [^795]. (A second time he draws water out of a second of the eight vessels with the formula given in Sûtra 10, putting instead of the words, ‘The shining one, &c.,’ the verse): ‘By which you have created prosperity, by which you have touched surâ, with which you have anointed the eyes, which is your’ glory, O A<i>s</i>vins.' <span id="p314"><sup><small>[ p. 314 ]</small></sup></span>

13\. (And he draws water out of three other vessels) with (the three verses), ‘Ye waters are’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>s</i>h. XI, 50-52), verse by verse.

14\. With (water drawn out of) the three other (vessels he besprinkles himself) silently.

15\. Having loosened his girdle with (the verse), ‘The highest band’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XII, 12), having put it down, having put on another garment, he worships the sun—

16\. [^796]. With (the formulas), 'Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in the morning. Thou art a tenfold winner; make me a tenfold winner. Make me attain to renown.

Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in day-time. Thou art a hundredfold winner; make me a hundredfold winner. Make me attain to renown.

Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in the evening. Thou art a thousandfold winner; make me a thousandfold winner. Make me attain to renown.’

17\. Having eaten curds or sesamum seeds, and having had his matted hair, the hair of his body, and his nails cut, he should cleanse his teeth with an Udumbara branch with (the verse), ‘Array yourselves for the enjoyment of food. Here has come king Soma: he will purify my mouth with glory and fortune.’ <span id="p315"><sup><small>[ p. 315 ]</small></sup></span>

18\. Having anointed himself and bathed again, he takes up the salve for nose and mouth with (the words), ‘Satiate my up-breathing and down-breathing; satiate my eye; satiate my ear!’

19\. Having poured out to the south the water with which he has washed his hands, with (the words), ‘Ye fathers, become pure,’ he should salve himself and murmur, ‘May I become well-looking with my eyes, well-shining with my face, well-hearing with my ears.’

20\. [^797]. He then should put on a garment which has not yet been washed, or not been soaked in lie, with (the formula), ‘For the sake of putting on, of bringing fame, of long life I shall reach old age. I live a hundred long autumns. For the sake of the increase of wealth I will clothe myself.’

21\. Then the upper garment with (the verse), ‘With glory (come) to me, Heaven and Earth. With glory, Indra and B<i>ri</i>haspati! May glory and fortune come to me! may glory be my lot!’

22\. [^798]. If (he has only) one (garment), he should cover himself (with a part of that garment as if it were an upper garment) with the second part of the former (Mantra; Sûtra 20).

23\. [^799]. He takes flowers with (the formula), ‘(The <span id="p316"><sup><small>[ p. 316 ]</small></sup></span> flowers) which _G<i>amadagni has brought for the sake of faith (has brought to </i>S_raddhâ?), of love, of the senses, them I take with glory and with fortune.’

24\. He then ties them (to his head) with (the verse), ‘The high, wide glory, which Indra has created for the Apsarases, the flowers bound up with that, I tie on to me, to bring me glory!’

25\. [^800]. He binds a turban to his head with (the verse), ‘A youth, well attired.’

26\. (He puts on) the two ear-rings with (the words), ‘An ornament art thou; may more ornaments be mine.’

27\. He salves his two eyes with (the formula), ‘V<i>ri</i>tra’s’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>ri</i>h. IV, 3 b).

28\. With (the words), ‘Brilliant art thou,’ he looks at his image in a mirror.

29\. He takes a parasol with (the words), 'Thou art B<i>ri</i>haspati's covering. Shelter me from evil. Do not shelter me from splendour and glory.’

30\. With (the words), ‘You are supports; protect me from all sides,’ he puts on the two shoes.

31\. With (the words), ‘From all powers of destruction protect me on all sides,’ he takes a bamboo staff.

32\. (For) the tooth-cleaner, &c. (the Mantras stated above are to be used) in every case; (for) the garment, the parasol, and the shoes, the Mantra (should only be recited) if they have not been used before.

8\. He sacrifices flour, over which ghee has been poured, to the serpents (with the following Mantras):

9\. 'To the lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish, terrestrial ones, svâhâ!

‘To the lord of the white serpents belonging to Vâyu, of the aerial ones, svâhâ!

‘To the lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Sûrya, of the celestial ones, svâhâ!

10\. The (cake) in one dish he offers entirely (without leaving a remainder for the sacrificer) with (the formula), ‘To the firm one, the son of the Earth, svâhâ!’

11\. [^841]. After he has eaten (of the sacrificial food), he throws a portion of the flour into a basket, goes out, besmears an elevated spot outside the hall (with cowdung), says, while a fire-brand is held (before him), ‘Do not step between (myself and the fire),’ and without speaking (anything except the Mantras), he causes the serpents to wash themselves, (pouring out water for them, with the formulas:)

14\. 'Lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish, terrestrial ones, this is thy Bali!

‘Lord of the white serpents belonging to Vâyu, of the aerial ones, this is thy Bali!

Sa<i>m</i>h. XIII, 6 seqq.).

19\. At that distance in which he wishes the serpents not to approach (the house), he should three times walk round the house, sprinkling an uninterrupted stream of water round it, with the two (verses), ‘Beat away, O white one, with thy foot’ (Sûtras 4 and 5).

20\. He gives away the (spoon called) Darvî (Sûtra 13) and the basket (Sûtra 11), having washed and warmed them.

25 [^847]. They eat the (rice) grains which must not form one coherent mass.

26\. Then (follows) the feeding of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.



## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 15.

1\. On the full-moon day of Praush<i>th</i>apada the sacrifice to Indra.

2\. [^848]. Having cooked milk-rice for Indra and cakes, and having put cakes round (the fire), he sacrifices the two Â<i>ya portions and Â</i>ya portions and Â<i>ya portions and Â</i>ya oblations to Indra, to Indrâ<i>ya portions and Â</i>î, to A<i>ya portions and Â</i>a Ekapad, to Ahi Budhnya, and to the Prosh<i>ya portions and Â</i>apadâs.

3\. [^849]. After he has eaten (his portion of the sacrificial food), he offers a Bali to the Maruts. For the <i>S</i>ruti says, ‘The Maruts eat what is not-sacrificed.’

4\. [^850]. (This Bali he offers) in A<i>s</i>vattha leaves, because it is said, ‘The Maruts stood in the A<i>s</i>vattha tree.’ <span id="p332"><sup><small>[ p. 332 ]</small></sup></span>

5 [^851]. (He offers it) with (the texts), ‘Brilliantly resplendent’ (Var. Sa<i>s</i>h. XVII, 80-85), Mantra by Mantra,

6\. [^852]. And with the (Mantra called) Vimukha.

7\. (This Mantra he repeats only) in his mind.

8\. [^853]. For the <i>S</i>ruti says, ‘These are their names.’

9\. [^854]. He murmurs, ‘To Indra the divine’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XVII, 86).

10\. Then (follows) the feeding of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.



## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 16.

1\. [^855]. On the full-moon day of Â<i>vayu</i>vayu<i>vayu</i>a the (offerings of) P<i>vayu</i><i>vayu</i>hâtakas (are made).

2\. Having cooked milk-rice for Indra he sacrifices it, mixed with curds, honey, and ghee, to Indra, Indrâ<i>s</i>î, the two A<i>s</i>vins, the full moon of Â<i>s</i>vayu<i>s</i>a, and to the autumn.

3\. [^856]. After he has eaten (his portion of the sacrificial food), he sacrifices with his joined hands a P<i>ri</i>shâtaka prepared with curds, with the words, ‘May what is deficient be made full to me; may what is full not decay to me. Svâhâ!’

4\. The inmates of the house look at the mixture of curds, honey, and ghee, with the Anuvâka, <span id="p333"><sup><small>[ p. 333 ]</small></sup></span> ‘May Indra come hither’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XX, 47 seqq.).

5\. [^857]. They let the calves join their mothers that night and the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î night.

6\. Then (follows) the feeding of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.


## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 17.

1\. [^858]. Now (follows) the sacrifice to Sîtâ.

2\. Wherever he sacrifices, be it (on a field) of rice or of barley, of that grain he should prepare a mess of cooked food.

3\. [^859]. One who has sacrificed may, if he likes, prepare elsewhere also a mess of cooked food, either of rice or of barley.

4\. [^860]. (There should be) no doubt (as to whether rice or barley is to be taken), as a rule thereon has been stated above.

5\. If it is impossible (to take one of the two species of corn), (that) is excluded.

6\. To the east or to the north of the field, on a <span id="p334"><sup><small>[ p. 334 ]</small></sup></span> clean spot that has been ploughed, so that the crop he not damaged,

7\. Or in the village, because (there) both (rice and barley) are united, and because no obstacle is there.

8\. Where he intends to cook (the sacrificial food), he establishes the fire on a place that has been smeared (with cowdung), which is elevated, and which has been sprinkled (with water), strews (round the fire) Darbha grass mixed with (stalks of) that (sort of corn to which the sacrifice refers), sacrifices the two Â<i>ya portions and Â</i>ya portions and Â<i>ya portions and Â</i>ya oblations (with the following Mantras):

9\. 'For whom earth and heaven, the intermediate points and the chief points (of the horizon) are veiled with light, that Indra I invoke here. May his weapons be friendly towards us. Svâhâ!

‘Whatsoever it be that I wish for at this sacrifice, O killer of V<i>ri</i>tra, may all that be fulfilled to me, and may I live a hundred autumns. Svâhâ!

‘May success, prosperity, earth, rain, eminence, excellence, luck here protect the creatures. Svâhâ!

‘In whose substance dwells the prosperity of all Vedic and worldly works, Indra's wife Sîtâ I invoke. May she not abandon me in whatever work I do. Svâhâ!

Her, who rich in horses, rich in cows, rich in delight indefatigably supports living beings, Urvarâ (i.e. the field) who is wreathed with threshing-floors, I invoke at this sacrifice, the firm One. May she not abandon me. Svâhâ!

10\. He makes oblations of the cooked sacrificial food to Sîtâ, Ya<i>g</i>â (the goddess of sacrifice), <i>S</i>amâ (the goddess of zealous devotion), Bhûti (the goddess of welfare). <span id="p335"><sup><small>[ p. 335 ]</small></sup></span>

11\. Some say that the giving (of the sacrificial food to the deities) accompanies the Mantras.

12\. [^861]. But this is excluded, as the <i>S</i>ruti says, ‘The giving (of the oblation to the deity) accompanies the word Svâhâ.’

13\. On the Ku<i>s</i>a grass which is left over from the strewing (of grass round the fire), he offers a Bali to the protecting demons of the furrow with (the Mantra), ‘They who are sitting towards the east with strong bows and quivers, may they protect thee from the east, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer this Bali to them.’

14\. [^862]. Then to the south with (the Mantra), ‘They who are sitting towards the south, not winking the eyes, wearing armour, may they protect thee from the south, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer this Bali to them.’

15\. [^863]. Then to the west with (the Mantra), ‘The powerful ones, the excellent ones, prosperity, earth, Pârsh<i>n</i>i, _S<i>n</i>m_kuri, may they protect thee from the west, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer this Bali to them.’

16\. Then to the north with (the Mantra), ‘The fearful ones, like to Vâyu in speed, may they protect <span id="p336"><sup><small>[ p. 336 ]</small></sup></span> thee from the north, on the field, on the threshing-floor, in the house, on the way, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer this Bali to them.’

17\. [^864]. Of another (sort of food) as the chief (food used at this sacrifice), and with the remainder of Â<i>g</i>ya, he distributes Balis as above.

18\. And the women should make accompanying oblations, because such is the custom.

19\. When the ceremony is finished, he should feed the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. He should feed the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.

End of the Second Kâ<i>nd</i>a.

[^766]: 304:8 The commentators differ as to whether the Â<i> tri</i>ârya or the youth should recite the verse. The comparison of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 2, 1 would rather tend to show that it is the teacher, but Gobhila II, 10 says expressly: athaina_m<i> tri</i>h<i> tri</i>n<i> tri</i>m<i> tri</i>ñ_<i> tri</i>amekhalâ_m<i> tri</i>k<i> tri</i>m<i> tri</i>ri_tasya goptrîti vâ.

This is the meaning of this Sûtra. The rules regarding the staff handed over by the Adhvaryu to the Ya<i>n</i>amâna at the dîkshâ ceremony are given by Kâtyâyana, <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VII, 4, 1-4.

[^788]: 311:41 The general rule here alluded to is, according to the commentators, that given by Kâtyâyana, <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra XXV, 1, 12. 13. There it is stated which expiatory oblations have to precede, when a rite that has not been performed, or that has been incorrectly performed, is to be performed for good.

[^789]: 311:42 Those who have not been initiated in due time, may act as p. 312 stated in Sûtra 41. But if the omission has been perpetuated through three generations, the descendant of such persons is subject to the rules stated in Sûtras 42 and 43.

[^790]: 312:43 Kâtyâyana, after having given the rules on the Vrâtyastoma sacrifice (see Weber, Indische Literaturgeschichte, 2nd edition, pp. 73 seq.), says: ‘Intercourse with them (who have performed that sacrifice) is permitted’ (<i>S</i>raut. XXII, 4, 28).

[^796]: 313:12 The reading of the Mantra seems to be corrupt. Compare the form in which it is given by Bhavadeva, quoted in Professor Stenzler's note on this Sûtra. Instead of <i>s</i>riyam we have probably to read, as Bhavadeva has, striyam; instead of akshyau, akshân. Professor Stenzler very pertinently compares Atharva-veda XIV, 1, 35. 36. Comp. also Mantrabrâhma<i>n</i>a I, 7, 5.

[^797]: 314:16 In the Mantra the Pâraskara MSS. give bhrâ<i>g</i>abh<i>g</i>sh<i>g</i>u_h<i>g</i>g<i>g</i>ri<i>g</i>t<i>g</i>h_, and the Gobhila MSS. (G<i>g</i>hya III, 4) bhrâ<i>g</i>abh<i>g</i>sh<i>g</i>ibhi_h_. Possibly the instrumental case is right. Böhtlingk and Roth propose to read bhrâ<i>g</i>ad<i>g</i>sh<i>g</i>i_h_.

[^829]: 323:3 I have left the words sarvarûpe <i>k</i>a untranslated. Evidently p. 324 sarvarûpa is identical with the doubtful word _s<i>avarûpa which twice occurs in the </i>S_âṅkhâyana-G<i>avarûpa which twice occurs in the </i>hya. See the discussion on that word in the note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 12, 10.

[^831]: 324:8 The Tânûnaptra is an invocation directed to Tanûnapt<i>ri</i> (i.e. the wind) by which the officiating priests and the Ya<i>g</i>amâna at a Soma sacrifice pledge their faith to do no harm to each other. See Indische Studien, X, 362.

[^832]: 325:12 The reading of the Mantra is doubtful. I think it should stand as Professor Stenzler has printed it, except that I should propose to correct yuvâ into yuvânâ (comp. Â<i>valâyana-</i>valâyana-<i>S</i>rauta VI, 12, 12). It is probable that the gods addressed are the two A<i>valâyana-</i>vins, who are called kavî and yuvânâ in several passages of the Vedas.

[^833]: 325:1 12, 1. See Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 5, 20; <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 6. On the three Ash<i>ri</i>akâs, see below, III, 3, 1.

[^834]: 325:4 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 5, 17, where the same expression kshapa<i>ri</i>a for interruptions of the study is used. The words ‘as above’ refer to chap. 10, 23. 24.

[^835]: 326:1 13, 1. Indra is the presiding deity over the constellation _G<i>yesh</i>th_â; see <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>yesh</i>hya I, 26, 16, &c.

[^836]: 326:2 The names of the genius Udalâkâ<i>s</i>yapa and of the female genius Svâtikârî occur, as far as I know, only hero. Böhtlingk-Roth propose to read Sphâti<i>s</i>kârî (‘the goddess who gives abundance’).

[^837]: 326:5 At the Agni-_k_ayana ceremony furrows are drawn with the plough on the Agni-kshetra with the verses Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XII, 69-7 2. Afterwards grains of different kinds are sown. See Kâtyâyana XVII, 2, 12; 3, 8; Indische Studien, XIII, 244 seq. Thus in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual the verse Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XII, 69 stands in a connection which does not conform to the occasion for which it would be used here.

[^838]: 327:7 ‘As above’ refers to Sûtra 2. On the Sîtâ-ya<i>g</i><i>g</i>a, see below, chap. 17.

[^839]: 327:1 14, 1 seqq. Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 5; Â<i>s</i>valâyana II, 1; Gobhila III, 7.

[^840]: 327:4 Â<i>n</i>valâyana II, 3, 3; <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 18, 1. For Vâru<i>n</i>ai_h<i>n</i>g<i>n</i>h_ I read Vâru<i>n</i>î_h_, râ<i>n</i>abândhavî_h_. Pra<i>n</i>â<i>h</i> is an interpolation.

[^841]: 327:5 Â<i>m</i>valâyana, loc. cit. One is rather tempted to correct ahir dada<i>m</i><i>m</i>a ka<i>m</i><i>m</i>ana, but Râma<i>m</i>andra's Paddhati on _S<i>m</i>s_a, as the Pâraskara MSS. do.

[^842]: 328:11 The ceremony with the fire-brand seems to stand in connection with the rule given by Â<i>s</i>valâyana, II, 1, 13, that before the sacrificer has given himself in charge' to the serpents, nobody is allowed to step between him and the Bali destined for the serpents. Comp. also below, Sûtra 23.

[^843]: 328:13 I have translated upaghâtam by ‘picking out.’ On the full p. 329 technical meaning of the term, which implies the omission of the upastara<i>n</i>a and abhighâra<i>n</i>a, see Bloomfield's note on G<i>n</i>hya-sa<i>n</i>graha I, 111 (Zeitschrift der deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XXXV, 568).

[^844]: 329:15 The words as above refer to Sûtra 11. Pralikhati, which I have translated ‘he combs them,’ is the same act for which Sâṅkhâyana (IV, 15, 7) says, pha<i>n</i>ena _k<i>n</i>t_ayati. I think Professor Stenzler is wrong in translating: Er scharrt (das Mehl) mit Kämmen zusammen. <i>G</i>ayarâma says: pralekhana_m<i>n</i>k<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>n_<i>n</i>ûyana_m<i>n</i>h_. tâni _k<i>n</i>s<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>th_âni bhavanti.

[^845]: 330:22 The Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î is the full-moon day of Mârga<i>n</i>îrsha, on which the Pratyavaroha<i>n</i>a ceremony is celebrated. See below, III, 2; Weber, die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra, II, 332. The expression darvyopaghâta<i>m</i> is the same that has occurred above in Sûtra 13.

[^846]: 330:23 Comp. Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 1, 13, and see above, Sûtra 11.

[^847]: 330:24 Prakshâlya seems to me to refer to the Darvî; see Sûtra 20.

[^848]: 331:25 Asa<i>m</i>syûtâ_h_. Comp. Böhtlingk-Roth s_v_. sa_m_\-sîv.

[^849]: 331:2 15, 2. After these Â<i>g</i>ya oblations follows the chief oblation of the whole sacrifice, the oblation of milk-rice to Indra. In one of Professor Stenzler's MSS. there is a special Sûtra inserted after Sûtra 2, ‘Of the cooked food he makes an oblation with (the formula), “To Indra svâhâ.”’ I do not, however, think it right to receive this Sûtra into the text, as the other MSS. do not support it, and the commentators did not find it in the text which they read.

[^850]: 331:3 Professor Stenzler's translation, ‘Die Maruts essen kein Opfer,’ seems to me not quite exact. I should prefer to say, ‘Die Maruts essen Nicht-Opfer.’ This passage, taken from <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a IV, 5, 2, 16, is quoted as supporting the rule that a Bali offering should be made to the Maruts; for in the technical language the term ahuta is applied to Bali offerings (<i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>n</i>hya I, 10, 7, hutoऽgnihotrahomena, ahuto balikarma<i>n</i>â).

[^851]: 331:4 When Indra called them to his help against V<i>ri</i>tra. <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>ri</i>a IV, 3, 3, 6.

[^852]: 332:5 This Sûtra is identical with the last words of Kâty. XVIII, 4, 23.

[^853]: 332:6 This is the first part of Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XVII, 86.

[^854]: 332:8 <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a IX, 3, I, 26. There it is said that _s<i>n</i>g<i>n</i>s_ (‘brilliantly resplendent’) &c. (the words used in Vâ_g_. Sa<i>n</i>h. XVII, 80) are names of the Maruts.

[^855]: 332:9 This Sûtra is identical with Kâty. XVIII, 4, 25.

[^856]: 332:1 16, 1. P<i>ri</i>shâtaka means a mixture of curds and butter. Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 16, 3; Â<i>ri</i>valâyana II, 2, 3; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha-pari<i>ri</i>ish<i>ri</i>a II, 59.

[^858]: 333:5 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 16, 4.

[^859]: 333:1 17, 1. The goddess Sîtâ is, as her name indicates, the rustic deity of the furrow.

[^860]: 333:3 Perhaps the meaning is that a person who has already once performed the Sîtâ-ya<i>g</i><i>g</i>a on the field, is allowed, when repeating the sacrifice another time, to celebrate it elsewhere, and to choose at his will between rice and barley.

[^861]: 333:4 A rule has been given in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra (Kâty. I, 9, 1: ‘Rice or barley, if a Havis \[is prescribed\]’) which shows that it is indifferent whether rice or barley is taken. Thus the sacrificer is free to elect the one or the other. At least this is the traditional meaning of this Sûtra. But possibly we had better understand it otherwise. The sacrificer should offer, according to Sûtra 3, rice or barley. Whether he has to take the one or the other, there can be no doubt, as the rule given above (Sûtra 2) shows that rice should be cooked, if the ceremony is performed for a rice-field, and barley, if for a barley-field.

[^862]: 335:12 The quotation has not been as yet identified in the <i>S</i>ruti itself, but the words quoted are found in Kâty.-<i>S</i>raut. I, 2, 7.

[^863]: 335:14 Some words in the beginning of the Mantra are lost. We should probably write: atha dakshi<i>n</i>ata_h_. ye dakshi<i>n</i>atoऽnimishâ<i>h</i> . . . varmi<i>n</i>a âsate, &c. Of course it is impossible to say which is the word that is wanting before (or perhaps after) varmi<i>n</i>a_h_.

[^864]: 335:15 Pârsh<i>n</i>i, which means ‘heel,’ stands here, of course, as the name of a protecting demon.

[^865]: 336:17 See above, chap. 13, 2.
