[^388]: 111:3 Anvâhârya literally means, what is offered (or given) after something else, supplementary. In the commentary on Gobhila, p. 666, a verse is quoted:
  amâvâsyâ_m<i> dvitîya</i>m<i> dvitîya</i>m<i> dvitîya</i>k_yate,
  ‘The second (<i>S</i>râddha) which is performed on the day of the new moon, that is called anvâhârya.’ First comes the Pi<i>nd</i>apit<i>n</i>ya<i>nd</i>a, and then follows the Anvâhârya <i>S</i>râddha; the last is identical with the Pârva<i>n</i>a <i>S</i>râddha, which is described as the chief form of <i>S</i>râddha ceremonies, for instance in <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>n</i>hya IV, 1.

[^401]: 113:25 See III, 7, 20 note.

[^402]: 113:26 I am not sure about the translation of the words golakânâ_m<i> madhyamapar</i>n_ena. The ordinary meaning of golaka is ‘ball,’ see, for instance, <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i> madhyamapar</i>hya IV, 19, 4. The commentary says, golakânâ_m<i> madhyamapar</i>s<i> madhyamapar</i>m<i> madhyamapar</i>n<i> madhyamapar</i>k_<i> madhyamapar</i>adena.

[^403]: 113:29 The name of the third of those rural deities is spelt differently; Dr. Knauer gives the readings, Ara<i>d</i>âm, Ara<i>d</i>âm, Aragam, Ararâm, Aram.

[^404]: 114:32 32-34. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 5, 40. I understand that this sacrifice stands in connection with the rural festivals which are treated of in the preceding Sûtras. In the commentary, from the mantra the conclusion is drawn that the ceremony in question belongs to the day of the Ekâsh<i>ri</i>akâ. But the Ekâsh<i>ri</i>akâ is the Ash<i>ri</i>akâ of the dark fortnight of Mâgha (see S.B.E. XXIX, 102), and the description of the rites belonging to that day has already been given above, Sûtras 17-21. It very frequently occurs in the G<i>ri</i>hya ritual that Mantras are used at sacrifices standing in no connection with those for which they have originally been composed.

[^405]: 114:1 5, 1 seq. Comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 2, 6 seq.

[^406]: 115:6 6-8. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 2, 23; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha I, 96. It is stated that the recitation of the Virûpâksha and Prapada formulas and also the parisamûhana (Sûtra 5) should be omitted at the so-called Kshiprahomas, i.e. at sacrifices performed without the assistance of a ya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>avid. See Bloomfield's notes on G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha I, 92. 96. Regarding the way in which a prâ<i>ri</i>âyâma (‘suppression of breath’) is performed, comp. Vasish<i>ri</i>a XXV, 13 (S.B.E. XIV, p. 126).

[^407]: 115:9 9 seq. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 1, 1 seq.

[^408]: 115:10 There are two meals a day. The words of this Sûtra, ‘Or three meals,’ are explained in the commentary in the following way. He should, if he does not entirely abstain from food through three days, take only three meals during that time, i.e. he should take one meal a day. The commentator adds that some read abhaktâni instead of bhaktâni (‘or he should omit three meals’), in which case the result would be the same. I prefer the reading p. 116 bhaktâni, and propose to supply, not, ‘he should eat,’ but ‘he should omit’ (‘abho<i>g</i>anam,’ Sûtra 9). Possibly the meaning is that three successive meals should be omitted; thus also the compiler of the Khâdira-G<i>g</i>hya seems to have understood this Sûtra.

[^411]: 116:13 My translation of this Sûtra differs from the commentary. There it is said: ‘An occurrence which is perceived only when it has happened (sannipatitam eva), and of which the cause by which it is produced is unknown, for instance the appearance of a halo, is called sânnipâtika. Such sânnipâtika ceremonies are uparish<i>t</i>âddaiksha. The dîkshâ is the preparatory consecration (of the sacrificer), for instance by three days of fasting. A ceremony which has its dîkshâ after itself is called uparish<i>t</i>âddaiksha.’ Similarly the commentary on Khâdira-G<i>t</i>hya IV, 1, 3 says, ‘uparish<i>t</i>ât sânnipâtike naimittike karma k<i>t</i>tvâbho<i>t</i>anam.’

[^412]: 117:23 The commentary explains pârthivam, ‘p<i>ri</i>thivyartha<i>m</i> kriyate, iti pârthivam, grâmakshetrâdyartham;’ similarly the commentary on Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 1, 13 says, ‘p<i>ri</i>thivîpatitvaprâptyartham idam ukta<i>m</i> karma.’

[^419]: 119:10 According to the commentary the formula ya<i>s</i>oऽham bhavâmi comprises five sections; thus it would include the sections II, 5, 9-13 of the Mantra-Brâhma<i>s</i>a. The Mantra quoted next by Gobhila (Sûtra 12) is really MB. II, 5, 14.

[^420]: 119:13 Comp. chap. 5, 24-27. One Kâ<i>m</i>sa is stated to be a measure equal to one Dro<i>m</i>a. The more usual spelling is ka<i>m</i>sa, and this reading is found in the corresponding passage of the Khâdira-G<i>m</i>hya (IV, 2, 1).

[^423]: 121:19 19-21. I have translated the words of these Sûtras without trying to express any meaning. According to the commentary the meaning is the following: 19. He should not build a house which has its door on the back-side, or which has one front-door and one back-door. 20. The house-door should not face the door of another house. 21. The house-door should be so constructed that the householder cannot be seen by _K<i>â</i>n_<i>â</i>âlas, &c., when he is performing religious acts or when dining in his house. Or, if instead of sa<i>â</i>lokî the reading sa<i>â</i>loki is accepted, the Sûtra means: the house-door should be so constructed, that valuable objects, &c., which are in the house, cannot be seen by passers-by.—The commentary on Khâdira-G<i>â</i>hya IV, 2, 15 contains the remark: dvâradvaya<i>m</i> (var. lectio, dvâra_m<i>â</i>m<i>â</i>ri_<i>â</i>u na syâd iti ke<i>â</i>it. This seems to me to lead to the right understanding of these Sûtras. I think we ought to read and to divide in this way: (19) anudvâra_m<i>â</i>k_a. (20. 21) g<i>â</i>hadvâra_m<i>â</i>m_loki syât. ‘And (let him construct) a back-door, so that it does not face the (chief) house-door.’ The Khâdira MSS. have the readings, asallokî, asandraloke, sa<i>â</i>loka.

[^424]: 122:22 22-24. These are <i>S</i>lokas to which the commentary very appropriately, though not exactly in the sense in which it was originally set down, applies the dictum so frequently found in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a texts: na hy ekasmâd aksharâd virâdhayanti. Dr. Knauer's attempts to restore correct <i>S</i>lokas are perhaps a little hazardous; he inserts in the third verse <i>k</i>a after plakshas, and in the second he changes the first brûyât into <i>k</i>a, whereby the second foot of the hemistich loses its regular shape ![](img/12200.jpg), and receives instead of it the form ![](img/12201.jpg).

[^425]: 122:25 He should remove an A<i>s</i>vattha tree from the east-side, &c.

[^426]: 122:26 He should sacrifice to the deities to whom the transplanted trees are sacred.

[^429]: 123:36 The commentary says: ‘The last oblation should be offered with the formula, “To Pra<i>g</i>âpati svâhâ!”’ Probably we ought to correct the text, Pra<i>g</i>âpata ity uttamâ, ‘the last (verse) is, “Pra<i>g</i>âpati!” (MB. II, 5, 8);’ see above, IV, 6, 9; Khâdira-G<i>g</i>hya IV, 2, 20.

  7\. I.e. he should sacrifice one oblation of rice, and one of barley.

[^435]: 125:8 Literally, to a person, &c. The meaning is, he should pronounce the name of that person. The Sûtra is repeated from IV, 5, 20; thus its expressions do not exactly fit the connection in which it stands here.

The Mantra is evidently an adaptation of the well-known verse addressed to the Âgrahâya<i>ri</i>î (Gobhila III, 9, 9; Mantra-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a II, 2, 1), or to the Ash<i>ri</i>akâ (Pâraskara III, 3, 5, 8): prathamâ ha vyuvâsa, &c. The first word arha<i>ri</i>â (‘duly’), containing an allusion to the occasion of the Arghya ceremony, to which this Mantra is adapted, seems to be quite right; the third word may be, as Dr. Knauer conjectures, uvâsa (‘she has dwelt,’ or perhaps rather ‘she has shone’). For the second word I am not able to suggest a correction.

[^448]: 130:15 I have adopted the reading <i>s</i>rîbhaksho, which is given in the Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and have followed the opinion of the commentator p. 131 that the whole Mantra, and not its single parts, should be repeated each time that he drinks of the Madhuparka. In the Khâdira-G<i>n</i>hya the text of the Mantra differs, and the rite is described differently (IV, 4, 15).

[^449]: 131:16 16, 17. Perhaps these two Sûtras should be rather understood as forming one Sûtra, and should be translated as I have done in Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 4, 16.
