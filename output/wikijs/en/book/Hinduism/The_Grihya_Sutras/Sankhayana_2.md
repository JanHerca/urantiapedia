## ADHYÂYA II, KHA<i>ND</i>A 1.

1\. [^119]. In the eighth year after the conception let him initiate a Brâhma<i>n</i>a,

2\. With an antelope-skin, <span id="p59">[<sup><small>p. 59</small></sup>]</span>

3\. Or in the tenth year after the conception.

4\. In the eleventh year after the conception a Kshatriya with the skin of a spotted deer,

5\. In the twelfth year after the conception a Vai<i>s</i>ya with a cow-hide.

6\. Until the sixteenth year the time has not passed for a Brâhma<i>n</i>a,

7\. Until the twenty-second for a Kshatriya,

8\. Until the twenty-fourth for a Vai<i>s</i>ya.

9\. [^120]. After that (time has passed), they become patitasâvitrîka (men who have lost their right of learning the Sâvitrî). <span id="p60">[<sup><small>p. 60</small></sup>]</span>

10\. Let them not initiate such men,

11\. Nor teach them,

12\. Nor perform sacrifices for them,

13\. Nor have intercourse with them.

14\. [^121]. Or (let them initiate students of) all (castes) wearing a (new) garment that has not yet been washed.

And wearing a girdle.

15\. The girdle of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a (shall be) made of Mu<i>nd</i>a grass,

16\. That of a Kshatriya (shall be) a bowstring,

17\. That of a Vai<i>s</i>ya a woollen thread.

18\. The staff of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a (shall be) made of Palâ<i>n</i>a or of Bilva wood,

19\. That of a Kshatriya of Nyagrodha wood,

20\. That of a Vai<i>s</i>ya of Udumbara wood.

21\. [^122]. That of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall reach the tip of the nose,

22\. That of the Kshatriya the forehead,

23\. That of the Vai<i>s</i>ya the hair.

24\. Or all (sorts of staffs are to be used) by (men of) all (castes).

25\. Whatsoever (the student) wears at his initiation, is at the disposal of the teacher. <span id="p61">[<sup><small>p. 61</small></sup>]</span>

26 [^123]. Having had him shaved all round (his head) he should initiate him.

27\. After (the student) has washed and adorned himself,

28\. [^124]. (And) after (the teacher) has sacrificed, both station themselves behind the fire, the teacher with his face turned to the east, the other with his face to the west.

29\. Let him initiate him standing while (the other also) stands.

30\. [^125]. \[‘The firm, powerful eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, strong and prosperous, a chaste, flowing vesture, this skin I put on, a valiant (man).’\]

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 2.

1\. ‘Here has come to us, protecting (us) from evil words, purifying our kin as a purifier, clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, with strength, this friendly goddess, this blessed girdle’—with these words, three times repeated, he ties the girdle from left to right thrice round. <span id="p62">[<sup><small>p. 62</small></sup>]</span>

2 [^126]. (There should be) one knot, or also three, or also five.

3\. [^127]. He adjusts the sacrificial cord with (the words), ‘The sacrificial cord art thou. With the cord of the sacrifice I invest thee.’

4\. [^128]. He fills the two hollows of (his own and the student's) joined hands (with water), and then says to him: ‘What is thy name?’

5\. ‘I am N.N., sir,’ says the other.

6\. [^129]. ‘Descending from the same <i>Ri</i>shis?’ says the teacher.

7\. ‘Descending from the same <i>Ri</i>shis, sir,’ says the other. <span id="p63">[<sup><small>p. 63</small></sup>]</span>

8\. ‘Declare (that thou art) a student, sir.’

9\. ‘I am a student, sir,’ says the other.

10\. With the words, ‘Bhûr bhuva_h<i> sva</i>h_’ (the teacher) sprinkles thrice with his joined hands (water) on the joined hands (of the student),

11\. [^130]. And seizing (the student's) hands with (his own) hands, holding the right uppermost, he murmurs,

12\. 'By the impulse of the god Savitar, with the arms of the two A<i>s</i>vins, with Pûshan's hands I initiate thee, N.N.’

13\. Those who are desirous of a host (of adherents, he should initiate) with (the verse), ‘Thee, (the lord) of hosts’ (Rig-veda II, 23, 1).

14\. Warriors with (the verse), ‘Come here, do not come to harm’ (Rig-veda VIII, 20, 1).

15\. Sick persons with the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis.



<span id="p64">[<sup><small>p. 64</small></sup>]</span>

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 3.

1\. [^131]. ‘Bhaga has seized thy hand, Savitar has seized thy hand, Pûshan has seized thy hand, Aryaman has seized thy hand. Mitra art thou by right, Agni is thy teacher, and I, N.N., both of us. Agni, I give this student in charge to thee. Indra, I give this student in charge to thee. Sun, I give this student in charge to thee. Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs, I give this student in charge to you, for the sake of long life, of blessed offspring and strength, of increase of wealth, of mastership of all Vedas, of renown, of bliss.’

2\. [^132]. 'In Indra's course I move; in the sun's course I move after him'—with these words he turns round from left to right,

3\. And grasping down with the span of his right hand over (the student's) right shoulder he touches the place of his heart with the words, ‘May I be dear to thy inviolate heart.’ <span id="p65">[<sup><small>p. 65</small></sup>]</span>

4\. Having silently turned round from right to left,

5\. [^133]. And then laying his hand with the fingers upwards on his (i.e. the student's) heart, he murmurs:

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 4.

1\. [^134]. ‘Under my will I take thy heart; my mind shall thy mind follow; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may B<i>ri</i>haspati join thee to me.’

2\. [^135]. ‘Thou art the Brahma<i>k</i>ârin of Kâma, N.N.!’

3\. [^136]. With the same text (see chap. 3, 2) he turns round as before,

4\. And touching with the span of his right hand (the student's) right shoulder, he murmurs: <span id="p66">[<sup><small>p. 66</small></sup>]</span>

5 [^137]. ‘A student art thou. Put on fuel. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time. Keep silence till the putting on of fuel.’

6\. With (the words), ‘Thine, Agni, is this piece of wood,’ he puts the fuel on (the fire), or silently.


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 5.

1\. [^138]. After one year (the teacher) recites the Sâvitrî (to the student),

2\. (Or) after three nights,

3\. Or immediately.

4\. [^139]. Let him recite a Gâyatrî to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a,

5\. A Trish<i>t</i>ubh to a Kshatriya,

6\. A <i>G</i>agatî to a Vai<i>s</i>ya.

7\. But let it be anyhow a verse sacred to Savitar.

8\. They seat themselves to the north of the fire,

9\. [^140]. The teacher with his face turned eastward, the other westward. <span id="p67">[<sup><small>p. 67</small></sup>]</span>

10 [^141]. After (the student) has said, ‘Recite, sir!’—

11\. The teacher, having pronounced the word OM, then causes the other one to say, ‘Recite the Sâvitrî, sir!’

12\. He then recites the Sâvitrî to him, the verse ‘That glorious (splendour) of Savitar’ (Rig-Veda III, 62, 10); (firstly) pâda by pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop.


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 6.

1\. [^142]. ‘Waters are ye by name; happy ones are ye by name; sappy ones are ye by name; undecaying ones are ye by name; fearless ones are ye by name; immortal ones are ye by name. Of you, being such, may I partake; receive me into your favour’—with these words (the teacher) makes the student sip water three times,

2\. [^143]. And hands over to him the staff with the five <span id="p68">[<sup><small>p. 68</small></sup>]</span> verses, ‘Blessing may give us’ (Rig-veda V, 51, 11-15).

3\. [^144]. An optional gift is the fee for the sacrifice.

4\. [^145]. After (the teacher) has led him round the fire, turning his right side towards it, (the student) goes through the village to beg food.

5\. (Let him beg,) however, of his mother first,

6\. Or of a woman who will not refuse.

7\. [^146]. Having announced the alms to his teacher, he may eat (the food himself) with the master's permission.

8\. The daily putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the ground, and obedience to the teacher: these are the standing duties of a student.




<span id="p69">[<sup><small>p. 69</small></sup>]</span>

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 7.

1\. [^147]. Now (follows the exposition) of the study of the Veda.

2\. [^148]. Both sit down to the north of the fire,

3\. The teacher with his face to the east, the other one to the west.

4\. [^149]. After (the student) has reverentially saluted the teacher's feet and has sprinkled his (own) hands (with water),

5\. And has kneeled down with his right knee on young Ku<i>s</i>a shoots at their roots,

6\. [^150]. And has grasped round (those Ku<i>s</i>a shoots) in 'heir middle with his hands, holding the right uppermost,

7\. The teacher, having seized them at their tops <span id="p70">[<sup><small>p. 70</small></sup>]</span> with his left hand, and with his right hand sprinkling them with water, then makes the other say:

8\. [^151]. ‘Recite the Sâvitrî, sir!’ says the other.

9\. ‘I recite the Sâvitrî to thee!’ says the teacher.

10\. [^152]. ‘Recite the Gâyatrî, sir!’ says the other.

‘I recite the Gâyatrî to thee!’ says the teacher.

11\. ‘Recite the verse of Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra, sir!’ says the other.

‘I recite the verse of Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra to thee!’ says the teacher.

12\. ‘Recite the <i>Ri</i>shis, sir!’ says the other.

I recite the <i>Ri</i>shis to thee!' says the teacher.

13\. ‘Recite the deities, sir!’ says the other.

‘I recite the deities to thee!’ says the teacher.

14\. ‘Recite the metres, sir!’ says the other.

‘I recite the metres to thee!’ says the teacher.

15\. ‘Recite the <i>S</i>ruti, sir!’ says the other.

‘I recite the <i>S</i>ruti to thee!’ says the teacher.

16\. ‘Recite the Sm<i>ri</i>ti, sir!’ says the other.

‘I recite the Sm<i>ri</i>ti to thee!’ says the teacher.

17\. [^153]. ‘Recite faith and insight, sir!’ says the other.

‘I recite faith and insight to thee!’ says the teacher. <span id="p71">[<sup><small>p. 71</small></sup>]</span>

18 [^154]. In that way, according to what <i>Ri</i>shi each hymn belongs to and what its deity and its metre is, thus (with the corresponding indications of <i>Ri</i>shi, &c.) let him recite each hymn;

19\. [^155]. Or also, if he does not know the <i>Ri</i>shis, deities, and metres, the teacher recites this verse, ‘That glorious (splendour) of Savitar’ (Rig-veda III, 62, 10), pâda by pâda, hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop, and says, when he has finished, ‘This (verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gâyatrî; Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra is its <i>Ri</i>shi).’ <span id="p72">[<sup><small>p. 72</small></sup>]</span>

20\. Let him thus recite (the hymns belonging to) each <i>Ri</i>shi, or (each) Anuvâka;

21\. [^156]. Of the short hymns (in the tenth Ma<i>nd</i>ala) an Anuvâka,

22\. Or as much as the master may think fit.

23\. Or optionally he may recite the first and last hymn of (each) <i>Ri</i>shi,

24\. [^157]. Or of (each) Anuvâka,

25\. (Or) one (verse) of the beginning of each hymn.

26\. The teacher may optionally say at the beginning of the hymn, ‘This is the commencement.’

27\. [^158]. This has been (further) explained in (the treatise about) the <i>Ri</i>shisvâdhyâya. <span id="p73">[<sup><small>p. 73</small></sup>]</span>

28 [^159]. When (the lesson) is finished, he takes the young Ku<i>s</i>a shoots, makes of cow-dung a pit at their roots, and sprinkles water on the Ku<i>s</i>a (shoots) for each hymn.

29\. [^160]. For the rest of the day standing and fasting.


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 8.

1\. [^161]. In the afternoon, having obtained by begging fried barley grains, he shall sacrifice them with his hand on the fire according to the rites of the Â<i>g</i>ya oblations with the text, ‘The lord of the seat, the <span id="p74">[<sup><small>p. 74</small></sup>]</span> wonderful’ (Rig-veda I, 18, 6 seq.), verse by verse, down to the end of the hymn,

2\. [^162]. Causing the teacher by (the gift of) food to pronounce auspicious wishes.


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 9.

1\. [^163]. In the forest, with a piece of wood in his hand, seated, he performs the Sandhyâ (or twilight devotion) constantly, observing silence, turning his face north-west, to the region between the chief (west) point and the intermediate (north-western) point (of the horizon), until the stars appear,

2\. [^164]. Murmuring, when (the twilight) has passed, the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, the Sâvitrî, and the auspicious hymns.

3\. In the same way in the morning, turning his face to the east, standing, until the disk of the sun appears.

10\. 1 [^165]. When (the sun) has risen, the study (of the Veda) goes on.



<span id="p75">[<sup><small>p. 75</small></sup>]</span>

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 10.

2\. Every day in the evening and in the morning,

3\. He establishes the fire (in its proper place), wipes (with his hand the ground) round (it), sprinkles (water) round (it), bends his right knee,

4\. [^166]. (And puts fuel on the fire with the texts,) 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great <i>G</i>âtavedas; may he, <i>G</i>âtavedas, give faith and insight to me. Svâhâ!

‘Firewood art thou; may we prosper. Fuel art thou; splendour art thou; put splendour into me. Svâhâ!

‘Being inflamed make me prosperous in offspring and wealth. Svâhâ!

Thine is this fuel, Agni; thereby thou shalt grow and gain vigour. And may we grow and gain vigour. Svâhâ!' <span id="p76">[<sup><small>p. 76</small></sup>]</span>

5\. Having then sprinkled (water) round (the fire),

6\. He approaches the fire with the verse, ‘May Agni (vouchsafe) to me faith and insight, not-forgetting (what I have learned) and memory; may this praiseful <i>G</i>âtavedas give blessing to us.’

\[^167]. He makes with ashes the tripu<i>nd</i>ra sign (the sign of three strokes) which is set forth in the (treatise on the) Saupar<i>n</i>avrata, which is revealed, which agrees with the tradition handed down by the ancients, with the five formulas ‘The threefold age’ (see above, I, 28, 9), one by one, on five (places), viz. the forehead, the heart, the right shoulder and the left, and then on the back.\]

8\. He who approaches the fire after having sacrificed thus, studies of these Vedas, one, two, three, or all.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 11.

1\. [^168]. Now (follows) the directing to the (special) observances.

2\. [^169]. The rules for it have been explained by the initiation.

3\. He does not recite the Sâvitrî. <span id="p77">[<sup><small>p. 77</small></sup>]</span>

4 [^170]. Some say that the handing over of the staff forms the end (of this ceremony).

5\. During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon—

6\. [^171]. The teacher having abstained through one day and one night, from sexual intercourse and from eating flesh—

7\. [^172]. With the exclusion of the fourteenth day and of the eighth (of the half-month),

8\. And of the first and last, according to some (teachers),

9\. [^173]. Or on what day else the constellation seems lucky to him, on that day he shall direct (the student) to the duties of holiness according to the <i>S</i>ukriya rite.

10\. [^174]. Let him observe (those) duties through three days, or twelve days, or one year, or as long as the master may think fit.

11\. The <i>S</i>âkvara (observance), however, (is to be kept) one year.

12\. (So also) the Vrâtika and Aupanishada (observances).

13\. [^175]. When the time has elapsed, when the duties <span id="p78">[<sup><small>p. 78</small></sup>]</span> have been observed, when the Veda has been studied down to the _S<i>a</i>m_yu-Bârhaspatya-(hymn), let (the teacher then), should he intend to instruct (the student) in the secret (part of the Veda), ascertain the time (through which the student has to observe the special rites) and the rules to be observed, from the (special) directions (that are handed down on this subject).


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 12.

1\. [^176]. After (the student) has eaten something in the morning, in the afternoon, to the north-east— <span id="p79">[<sup><small>p. 79</small></sup>]</span>

2\. Having sacrificed, the teacher then asks him with regard to those deities to whom he has been given in charge (see above, chap. 3, 1), ‘Hast thou fulfilled the duties of holiness before Agni, Indra, the Sun, and the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs?’ <span id="p80">[<sup><small>p. 80</small></sup>]</span>

3\. If he answers, ‘I have fulfilled them, sir!’—

4\. The teacher three times envelops, from the left to the right, with a fresh garment the face (of the student) who is standing behind the fire, in front of the teacher, with his face to the east.

5\. [^177]. He turns the skirt (of that garment) upwards so that it cannot slip down,

6\. [^178]. (And says) 'Leaving off for three days the putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the ground, and the obedience to the teacher, fast in the forest, in a god's house or in a place where Agnihotra is performed, keeping silence, with earnest care.' <span id="p81">[<sup><small>p. 81</small></sup>]</span>

7\. Here some (teachers) prescribe the same observances only for one night, during which he is to stand.

8\. [^179]. The teacher refrains from eating flesh and from sexual intercourse.

9\. When those three days or that night has elapsed, going out from the village he shall avoid to look at the following (persons or things) that form impediments for the study (of the Veda):

10\. [^180]. Raw flesh, a _K<i>a</i>n_<i>a</i>âla, a woman that has lately been confined, or that has her courses, blood, persons whose hands have been cut off, cemeteries, and all sorts of corpse-like (animals?) which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?), keeping them away from the place where he dwells. <span id="p82">[<sup><small>p. 82</small></sup>]</span>

11\. Going out (from the village) in a north-eastern direction the teacher sits down on a clean spot. turning his face to the east.

12\. [^181]. When the sun has risen, he recites, in the way prescribed for the Veda-study, (the Âra<i>n</i>yaka texts to the student) who is to keep silence and who wears a turban.

13\. [^182]. This rule is to be observed only for the Mahânâmnî verses.

14\. At the sections however that follow (after the Mahânâmnîs) the other one hears while the teacher recites them for himself.

15\. He gives (to the teacher) the turban, a vessel, a good cow.

16\. (The teacher accepts the gifts) with the verses, <span id="p83">[<sup><small>p. 83</small></sup>]</span> ‘Thou him’ (Rig-veda I, 18, 5), and, ‘High in the sky’ (Rig-veda X, 107, 2), or (he accepts them) all with the Pra<i>n</i>ava (i.e. the syllable Om).

17\. Here some prepare a mess of rice for the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs at all sections (of the Âra<i>s</i>yaka);

18\. [^183]. For the gods to whom he has been given in charge, according to Mâ<i>nd</i>ûkeya.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 13.

1\. Now (follow) the rules regarding the staff.

2\. Let him not leave a passage between himself and the staff.

3\. [^184]. Now should any one of these things, viz. staff, girdle, or sacrificial cord, break or rend, the same penance (takes place) therefore which (has been prescribed) at the wedding with regard to the chariot.

4\. If the girdle cannot be repaired, he makes another and speaks over it (the following verses):

5\. 'Thou who knowest the distinction of pure and impure, divine protectress Sarasvatî, O girdle, prolong my vow unimpaired, unbroken.

‘Thou, Agni, art the pure bearer of vows. Agni, carry hither the gods to our sacrifice and our oblation.

‘Bearing the vows, the infallible protector of vows, be our messenger, undecaying and mighty. Giving treasures, merciful, Agni, protect us, that we may live, <i>G</i>âtavedas!

6\. And he ties the sacrificial cord to the staff.

7\. Here it is said also: <span id="p84">[<sup><small>p. 84</small></sup>]</span>

8 [^185]. 'Let him sacrifice the sacrificial cord and the staff, the girdle and also the skin in water after the completion of his vow with a Varu<i>n</i>a-verse or with the essence (of the Vedas, i.e. the syllable Om).

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 14.

1\. [^186]. Now (follows) the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva (sacrifice).

2\. [^187]. The rite of the sacrifice has been explained.

3\. Let him pour oblations of prepared Vai<i>s</i>vadeva food in the evening and in the morning into the (sacred) domestic fire.

4\. ‘To Agni svâhâ! To Soma svâhâ! To Indra and Agni svâhâ! To Vish<i>n</i>u svâhâ! To Bharadvâ<i>n</i>a Dhanvantari svâhâ! To the Vi<i>n</i>ve devâs svâhâ! To Pra<i>n</i>âpati svâhâ! To Aditi svâhâ! To Anumati svâhâ! To Agni Svish<i>n</i>ak<i>n</i>t <span id="p85">[<sup><small>p. 85</small></sup>]</span> svâhâ!’—having thus offered the oblations belonging to those deities,

5\. He then shall offer Balis (i.e. portions of food) in the centre of the floor to the same deities; (then another Bali with the words,) ‘Adoration to Brahman and to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as!’ and (with the verse), ‘Vâstoshpati, accept us’ (Rig-veda VII, 54, 1) in the centre of the floor to Vâstoshpati.

6\. [^188]. He then distributes Balis, from the left to the right, through the different quarters (of the horizon, to the presiding deities) in due order (with the words),

7\. ‘Adoration to Indra and to those belonging to Indra! Adoration to Yama and to those belonging to Yama! Adoration to Varu<i>n</i>a and to those belonging to Varu<i>n</i>a! Adoration to Soma and to those belonging to Soma! Adoration to B<i>n</i>haspati and to those belonging to B<i>n</i>haspati!’

8\. [^189]. Then (turned) towards the disk of the sun, 'Adoration to Aditi and to the Âdityas! Adoration

5\. ‘He shall offer a Bali to those deities, i.e. to those ten deities to whom he has sacrificed, to Agni, &c. (see Sûtra 4), addressing them with the word, “Adoration (to such and such a deity”)—because in the other cases the word “adoration” (nama<i>h</i>) has been prescribed for the Bali.’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a. <span id="p86">[<sup><small>p. 86</small></sup>]</span> to the Nakshatras, to seasons, to months, to half-months, to days and nights, to years!’

9\. ‘To Pûshan, the path-maker; to Dhâtar, to Vidhâtar, and to the Maruts’—(thus) on the thresholds.

10\. To Vish<i>n</i>u on the grindstone.

11\. ‘To the tree’—(thus) in the mortar.

12\. ‘To the herbs’—(thus) where the herbs are kept.

13\. ‘To Par<i>g</i>anya, to the waters’—(thus) near the water-pot.

14\. ‘Adoration to <i>S</i>rî’—(thus) in the bed at the head, 'to Bhadrakâlî at the foot.

15\. In the privy, ‘Adoration to Sarvânnabhûti!’

16\. Then (he throws a Bali) into the air, in the evening with the words, ‘To the night-walkers,’ in the morning with the words, ‘To the day-walkers,’ and with the Verse,‘ Which gods’ (Rig-veda I, 139, 11).

17\. To the unknown deities to the north, and to Dhanapati (i.e. the Lord of treasures).

I8. With the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder he pours out the remnant to the south with the verse, ‘They whom the fire has burnt’ (Rig-veda X, 15, 14).

19\. When he has made his offerings to gods, fathers (i.e. Manes), and men, let him give food to a <i>S</i>rotriya (i.e. to a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a).

20\. Or let him give alms (of food) to a student.

## Footnotes

[^120]: 58:1 1, 1. With regard to the standing terminology of the Upanayana, or the initiation of the student, we may observe that upa-nî does not mean, as, for instance, Professor Stenzler seems to understand it, ‘to introduce a student to his teacher.’ Thus Pâraskara's Sûtra II, 2, 1, ash<i>t</i>âvarsha_m<i>t</i>n_am upanayet, &c., is translated by that distinguished scholar, ‘Den achtjährigen Brâhma<i>t</i>a soll er (beim Lehrer) einführen,’ &c. (comp. also Â<i>t</i>valâyana-G<i>t</i>hya I, 19, 1). The texts clearly point to another translation of upa-nî, for they show that the person that introduces the student (upanayati or upanayate; the middle is used very frequently, for instance, <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>t</i>a XI, 5, 4, 1; <i>S</i>âṅkh. II, I, 25) is not the father or a relation of the youth who could be supposed to lead him to the teacher, but the teacher himself; he introduces (upanayati) him to the brahma<i>t</i>arya, or introduces him with himself, and the student enters upon (upaiti) the brahma<i>t</i>arya, or enters with (upaiti) the teacher; he who has thus entered upon studentship, is consequently designated as upeta (<i>S</i>âṅkh. IV, 8, 1; Pâraskara III, 10, 10), and for the initiation, which is usually called up an ay an a, occasionally also the word upâyana is used (see the Mânava-G<i>t</i>hya I, 22, quoted by Professor Jolly in his article, Das Dharma-sûtra des Vish<i>t</i>u, p. 79). The following passages may be quoted here as supporting our opinion on this terminology. At <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>t</i>a XI, 5, 3, 13 _S<i>t</i>k_eya says to Uddâlaka Âru<i>t</i>i, ‘I will enter (as a student) with the reverend One’ (upâyâni bhagavantam); and Âru<i>t</i>i replies, ‘Come, enter (with me)!’ (ehy upehi), ‘and he initiated him’ (ta<i>m</i> hopaninye). Ibid. XI, 5, 4, 16 it is stated that according to some a teacher who has initiated a Brâhma<i>t</i>a as a student (brâhma<i>t</i>a_m<i>t</i>k_aryam upanîya) should abstain from sexual intercourse, for a student who enters upon studentship (yo brahma<i>t</i>aryam upaiti) becomes, as it were, a garbha, &c. Finally we may add that the Buddhist terminology regarding the entering into the order or upon a life of righteousness is clearly connected with that followed, for instance, in the dialogue between p. 59 _S<i>t</i>k<i>t</i>n_i. As _S<i>t</i>k_eya there says, upâyâni bhagavantam, we frequently read in the Pâli books expressions like this, upemi Buddha_m<i>t</i>n<i>t</i>m<i>t</i>ñ<i>t</i>k<i>t</i>m_, &c. (Dhammap. A<i>t</i><i>t</i>akathâ, p. 97, ed. Fausböll), and as Âru<i>t</i>i replies, ehy upehi, Buddha says to those who wish to be ordained, ehi bhikkhu, svâkkhâto dhammo, _k<i>t</i>k<i>t</i>m_, &c. (Mahâvagga I, 6, 32, &c.; S.B.E., vol. xiii, p. 74, note).

The counting of the years not from the birth but from the conception occurs both in the Brahmanical and in the Buddhist ordinances, comp. H. O., Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde, p. 354, note 1. Several G<i>ri</i>hya texts (for instance, Â<i>ri</i>v. I, 19, 1. 2) admit both ways of counting the years. The number of years given for the Upanayana of persons of the three castes (Brâhma<i>ri</i>as 8-16, Kshatriyas 11-22, Vai<i>ri</i>yas 12-24) is evidently derived from the number of syllables of the three metres which are so very frequently stated to correspond to the three castes, to the three gods or categories of gods (Agni, Indra, Vi<i>ri</i>ve devâs) &c., viz. the Gâyatrî, the Trish<i>ri</i>ubh, and the <i>G</i>agatî. This is a very curious example, showing how in India phantastical speculations like those regarding the mystical qualities of the metres, were strong enough to influence the customs and institutions of real life.

[^121]: 59:9 9 seq. All these are standing expressions recurring nearly identically in most of the G<i>ri</i>hya and Dharma-sûtras. In the rule contained in Sûtra 13 a number of the parallel texts have vivaheyu_h<i>ri</i>h_, others have vyavahareyu_h_. Comp. Vasish<i>ri</i>a XI, 75; Indische Studien, vol. x, p. 21.

[^122]: 60:14 This Sûtra should rather be divided into two, as indicated in the translation. As to the mekhalâ (girdle) comp. below, chap. 2, 1.

[^123]: 60:21 There is no doubt that prâ<i>n</i>asammito (which Nârâya<i>n</i>a explains thus, ‘prâ<i>n</i>a is the wind \[or breath\]; \[the staff should\] reach to the place where the wind leaves the body, i.e. to the tip of the nose’) should either be corrected into, or explained as, ghrâ<i>n</i>asammito; the <i>S</i>âmbavya MS. has ghrâ<i>n</i>ântiko brâhma<i>n</i>asya. Comp. Gautama I, 26, &c. The parallel texts agree in assigning the longer staff to the higher, not as <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana does, to the lower caste.

[^124]: 61:26 After the introductory remarks given in the preceding Sûtras the ritual itself of the Upanayana is now described.

[^125]: 61:28 Nârâya<i>n</i>a: hutvâ’nâde<i>n</i>aparibhâshâta<i>h</i> (see above, I, 12, 13) purastâtsa<i>nd</i><i>n</i>aka_m<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>m_ (see above, I, 5, 2) <i>g</i>aghanena . . . tish<i>n</i>ata_h_.

[^126]: 61:30 This Sûtra is wanting in most of the MSS. (see the note, p. 48 of the German edition). It contains the Mantra with which the A<i>g</i>ina (the hide mentioned in Sûtras 2, 4, 5 of this chapter) is put on. Nârâya<i>g</i>a gives the Mantra which he says is taken from the Mâdhyandina-G<i>g</i>hya (in the Pâraskara-G<i>g</i>hya it is not found), after chap. 2, 3, and he states that the corresponding act to which it belongs has its place after the rites concerning the girdle (chap. 2, 1) and the sacrificial cord (2, 3).

[^127]: 62:2 2, 2. Râma<i>k</i>andra: 'Let him make one, or three, or five knots, according to (the student's) Ârsheya,' i.e. accordingly as he belongs to a family that invokes, in the Pravara ceremony, one, or three, or five <i>Ri</i>shis as their ancestors. Comp. Weber, Indische Studien, vol. x, p. 79.

[^128]: 62:3 On the sacrificial cord (upavita) comp. the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha-pari<i>ri</i>ish<i>ri</i>a II, 48 seq.

[^129]: 62:4 Nârâya<i>n</i>a: Â<i>n</i>ârya âtmano mâ<i>n</i>avakasya _k<i>n</i>ñ_<i>n</i>alî udakena pûrayitvâ, &c.

[^130]: 62:6-7 6, 7. A similar dialogue between the teacher and the student at the Upanayana is given in the Kau<i>s</i>ika-sûtra (ap. Weber, Indische Studien, X, 71). The student there says, ‘Make me an Ârsheya (a descendant of the <i>Ri</i>shis) and one who has relations, and initiate me.’ And the teacher replies, ‘I make thee an Ârsheya and one who has relations, and I initiate thee.’ As in this passage of the Kau<i>s</i>ika-sûtra the teacher is represented as having the power of making, by the Upanayana ceremony, an Ârsheya of the student, thus, according to the view expressed by Professor Weber (loc. cit., p. 72 seq.), <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana would even give it into the teacher's power to make the student his samânârsheya, i.e. to extend his own Ârsheya on as many pupils as he likes. Professor Weber understands the sixth Sûtra so that the teacher would have to say, samânârsheyo bhavân brûhi (Nârâya<i>s</i>a: bhavân brûhîti brahma<i>s</i>ârî bhavân brûhîty ata<i>h</i> \[Sûtra 8\] si<i>s</i>hâvalokananyâyenâtrânusha<i>s</i>yate. According to Râma<i>s</i>andra's Paddhati he is p. 63 only to say samânârsheya<i>h</i>). The student answers, samânârsheyo ’ham bho; Professor Weber, who supplies the imperative asâni, translates this, ‘May I have the same Ârsheya, sir!’

I think it more natural to simply translate the teacher's question, ‘Art thou samânârsheya?’ (or, supplying bhavân brûhi from Sûtra 8, ‘Declare that thou art samânârsheya’), and the student's reply, I am samânârsheya, sir!' Thus we ought possibly to consider these formulas, which state a fictitious, ideal samânârsheyatva of the teacher and the students as a trace, and as far as I can see as the only trace, of an ancient rule requiring a real samânârsheyatva of teacher and student. As long as the ritual differences between the different Gotras, of which, as is well known, only a few traces have survived in the Vedic tradition, had retained their full importance, it can indeed scarcely have been considered as admissible that a young Brâhma<i>n</i>a should be confided to the guidance of a teacher who sacrificed and invoked the gods in another way than the customs of the pupil's own family required.

[^131]: 63:11 Nârâya<i>n</i>a: dakshi<i>n</i>ottarâbhyâ_m<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>n_ottarau, &c.

[^132]: 64:1 3. 1. T. Nârâya<i>n</i>a: ‘Instead of asau (N.N.) he puts the name of the student in the vocative case.’ I think rather that the teacher here pronounced his own name. Comp. asâv aha<i>m</i> bho, chap. 2, 5, &c., and the Mantra in Pâraskara II, 2, 20.

The text of the Mantra shows that the Â<i>k</i>ârya here seizes the hand of the Brahma<i>k</i>ârin; comp. Â<i>k</i>valâyana I, 20, 4-6, where it is stated that he seizes the student's hand together with the thumb, quite in the way prescribed for the wedding at <i>S</i>âṅkh. I, 13, 2. Comp. also Pâraskara II, 2, 1 7. Nârâya<i>k</i>a: mâ<i>k</i>avakasya g<i>k</i>hîtasa<i>k</i>pu<i>k</i>a evâ<i>k</i>âryo Bhagas ta ima_m<i>k</i>m<i>k</i>g_apan, &c.

[^133]: 64:2 Literally, ‘he turns round, following his right arm.’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a here has the following note, ‘Â<i>n</i>âryo ba<i>n</i>or dakshi<i>n</i>a_m<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>ri<i>n</i>n_ânvâvartayet. ayam artha_h_, â<i>n</i>ârya ima_m<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>g<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>t<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>k<i>n</i>k<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>m_ kârayet.’ I believe that the commentator here, as he frequently does, instead of interpreting the text of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, fathers p. 65 on him statements belonging to other Sûtras, in this case probably to Â<i>n</i>valâyana I, 20, 9. As our text has not anvâvartya but anvâv<i>n</i>tya; and in the Mantra not âvartasva but âvarte, we must conclude that he turned round himself, and, as far as the statements of the text go, did not cause the pupil to do so.

[^134]: 65:5 The gesture is the same as that prescribed in the Pâraskara-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 8, 8 to the bridegroom at the wedding; the Mantra there is identical with <i>S</i>âṅkh. II, 4, 1, the only difference consisting in the name of the god who is invoked to unite the two: at the wedding this is Pra<i>ri</i>âpati, of course, because he is ‘lord of offspring,’ at the Upanayana, B<i>ri</i>haspati, the Brahman κατ᾽ εξοχήν among the gods. It is very natural that at the Upanayana and at the Vivâha, which both are destined to establish an intimate union between two persons hitherto strangers to each other, a number of identical rites should occur, for instance, the seizing of the hand; see the note on Sûtra 1.

[^135]: 65:1 4, 1. Comp. Pârask. I, 8, 8, and the note on chap. 3, 3. See also Atharva-veda VI, 94, 2.

[^136]: 65:2 As to Kâmasya brahma<i>k</i>âry asi, see my remarks in the Introduction, p. 9.

[^137]: 65:3 He turns round as described, chap. 3, 2. Nârâya<i>n</i>a here also explains paryâv<i>n</i>tya paryâvartana<i>m</i> kârayitvâ. See our note above, loc. cit.

[^138]: 66:5 According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a the student correspondingly answers, to the teacher's word, ‘A student art thou,’ ‘I will’ (asâni), to ‘Put on fuel,’ ‘I will put it on,’ &c. Eating water means sipping water after having eased oneself. On the putting on of fuel, comp. Sûtra 6 and chap. 10. The whole formula given in this Sûtra is already found in the <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a XI, 5, 4, 5.

[^139]: 66:1 5, 1. The study of the Veda is opened by the Sâvitrî. Comp. <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a, loc. cit., §§ 6 seq.

[^140]: 66:4-6 The Gâyatrî which the teacher shall recite to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a is the same verse of which it is said below, chap. q, II, that it belongs to Vi<i>n</i>vâmitra (Rig-veda III, 62, to); the Trish<i>n</i>ubh which is taught to the Kshatriya is a verse ascribed to Hira<i>n</i>yastûpa, Rig-veda I, 35, 2; the <i>G</i>agatî which is to be repeated to a Vai<i>n</i>ya is Rig-veda IV, 40, 5, belonging to Vâmadeva, or Rig-veda I, 35, 9, belonging to Hira<i>n</i>yastûpa. See the note on chap. 7, 10.

[^141]: 66:9 The same position is prescribed, in the same words, for the study of the main part of the Veda, below, chap. 7, 3; during p. 67 the study of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka the position is slightly different (VI, 3, 2). According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a this Sûtra would contain a nishedha of the Sûtras 828 and 829 of the Rig-veda-Prâti<i>n</i>âkhya (p. ccxcii of Professor Max Müller's edition).

[^142]: 67:10-11 10, 11. The Indian tradition divides these Sûtras after â<i>k</i>ârya_h_, so that the words adhîhi bho would have to be pronounced by the teacher. Thus also Nârâya<i>k</i>a explains, â<i>k</i>ârya adhîhi bho 3 iti mâ<i>k</i>avakam uktvâ, &c. In my opinion it is the student or the students who say adhîhi bho. Thus the Prâti<i>k</i>âkhya (Sûtra 831, ed. Max Müller) says, ‘They invite him with the words adhîhi bho 3, all the students the teacher, having embraced his feet.’ Comp. also below, IV, 8, 12, the greater part of which Sûtra is word for word identical with these rules; VI, 3, 6; Gautama I, 46; Gobhila II, 10, 38.

[^143]: 67:1-2 6, 1, 2. Râma<i>k</i>andra: ‘. . . with this Mantra which the teacher tells him, and which he (the student) pronounces, he sips water p. 68 three times . . . He (the teacher) then gives him again the staff, which he had given him before silently.’ I do not think that this double handing over of the staff agrees with the real meaning of the text; Gobhila also (II, 10) and Â<i>k</i>valâyana (I, 22, 1) prescribe the da<i>k</i><i>k</i>apradâna after the repetition of the Sâvitrî, without mentioning that the same had been already done before; Pâraskara II, 2, II speaks of the handing over of the staff before the recital of the Sâvitrî, and does not state that it should be repeated afterwards.

All these ceremonies, the teaching of the Sâvitrî as well as the da<i>nd</i>apradâna, were considered as forming part of the Upanayana, even though a longer or shorter space of time (chap. 5, 1-3) might elapse between the first arrival of the student at the teacher's house and the performing of these rites. This follows from chap. 11, Sûtras 2-4.

[^144]: 67:2 These five verses have already occurred above at I, 15, 12.

[^145]: 68:3 Comp. I, 14, 13-15.

[^146]: 68:4 4 seq. On the student's begging of alms compare the more detailed rules in Pâraskara II, 5; Âpastamba I, 3, &c.

[^147]: 68:7 Comp. the passages quoted by Professor Bühler on Âpastamba I, 3, 31 (S.B.E., vol. ii, p. 22).

[^148]: 69:1 7, 1. Nârâya<i>n</i>a: ‘Now (atha), i.e. after the observance of the <i>S</i>ukriya vrata,’ &c. On the Sukriya vrata which has to be undergone before the Anuva<i>n</i>ana treated of in this chapter can be performed, see the note on chap. 4, 1, and below, chap. II, 9. One would have expected that in the arrangement of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana the rites belonging to the Sukriya vrata would precede the exposition of the Anuva<i>n</i>ana. Perhaps it was in consequence of the exact analogy of the Sukriya with the <i>S</i>âkvara, Vrâtika, Aupanishada vratas, that the description of the former has been postponed till the latter had to be treated of.

Râma<i>k</i>andra's Paddhati has the following remark here, ‘Now the way of studying the Veda, called Anuva<i>k</i>ana, is set forth. This can be done only after the Sukriya vrata has been enjoined on the student; before that nothing but the Sâvitrî can be taught to him.’

[^149]: 69:2 2 seq. Comp. above, chap. 2, 8 seq.

[^150]: 69:4 The way in which this reverential salutation should be performed is described below, IV, 12, 1 seq.

[^153]: 70:10 Comp. the note on chap. 5, 4-6. Nârâya<i>n</i>a states, in accordance with these Sûtras of the fifth chapter, that in case the student belongs to the second or third caste, an Ûha (i.e. a corresponding alteration of the formulas; from the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra, VI, 1, 3 the definition is quoted here _s<i>n</i>m_ bruvate) takes place. If he is a Kshatriya, he has to say, ‘Recite the Trish<i>n</i>ubh, sir!’—‘Recite the verse of Hira<i>n</i>yastûpa (Rig-veda I, 35, 2), sir!’ A Vai<i>n</i>ya has to say, ‘Recite the <i>G</i>agatî, sir!’—‘Recite the verse of Hira<i>n</i>yastûpa (or, of Vâmadeva, Rig-veda I, 35, 9 or IV, 40, 5), sir!’

[^154]: 70:17 Comp. Indische Studien, X, 132, note 1.

[^155]: 71:18-20 I do not think that Professor Weber (Indische Studien, X, 132) has quite exactly rendered the meaning of these Sûtras when he says, ‘The teacher then (i.e. after the formula of Sûtra 17 has been pronounced) teaches him first the <i>Ri</i>shi, the deity, and the metre of each Mantra. In case he does not know them himself for a Mantra, he recites the holy Sâvitrî (tat Savitur vare<i>n</i>yam). After this he teaches him in due order either (1) the single <i>Ri</i>shis, i.e. the hymns belonging to each <i>Ri</i>shi, or (2) the single Anuvâkas,’ &C.—It does not seem quite probable to me that the student should have had to learn first the <i>Ri</i>shis, deities, and metres of the whole Veda, before the text of the hymns was taught him; I rather believe that hymn by hymn the indication of the <i>Ri</i>shis, &c. preceded the anuva<i>n</i>ana of the text itself, and with this opinion the statement of Nârâya<i>n</i>a agrees, ‘Eva_m<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>ri<i>n</i>kh<i>n</i>h<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>m_ Agnim î<i>n</i>a ityâdika_m<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>k_âryoऽnubrûyât.’

[^156]: 71:19 According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a by esheti (literally, ‘This \[is the _Ri__k_\]’) it is meant that the teacher, after having recited the Sâvitrî in the three ways mentioned, should say to the student, ‘This <i>Rik<i> is in the Gâyatrî metre. If recited pâda by pâda, it has three pâdas. Thus also this _Ri__k_, if recited hemistich by hemistich, has two Avasânas (pauses), the first at the end of the hemistich, the second at the end of the third <i>k</i>arma (or pâda). Thus also this <i>Rik<i> is recited without stopping; at the end of the three _k<i>n</i>n_as, or of the twenty-four syllables, the pause (avasâna) should be made. Thus I recite to thee the Sâvitrî; I recite to thee the Gâyatrî; I recite to thee the verse of Vi<i>n</i>vâmitra.’ ‘For,’ adds Nârâya<i>n</i>a, ‘if the Gâyatrî has been recited, the whole complex of the Veda being of that very p. 72 substance, a complete knowledge thereof has been produced.’ The commentator then indicates a shorter form for the teacher's words which our Sûtra prescribes by esheti, ‘This verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gâyatrî; its <i>Ri</i>shi is Vi<i>n</i>vâmitra.’

[^157]: 72:21 The Kshudrasûktas are the hymns Rig-veda X, 129-191.

[^158]: 72:24 24 seq. This seems to be an abridged method by which students who had not the intention of becoming Vedic scholars, and probably chiefly students of the Kshatriya and Vai<i>s</i>ya caste, could fulfil their duty of learning the Veda; a student who knew the first and last hymn of a <i>Ri</i>shi, or of an Anuvâka, was, as would seem from these Sûtras, by a sort of fiction considered as though he had known the whole portion belonging to that <i>Ri</i>shi, or the whole Anuvâka.

[^159]: 72:27 Nârâya<i>n</i>a explains _Ri<i>n</i>m_hitâ. He says, The Anuvâ<i>n</i>ana which has been declared here, is to be understood also with regard to the svâdhyâya, i.e. to the Sa<i>n</i>hitâ of the Mantras.‘ I think there is a blunder in the MS., and instead of tad api svâdhyâye . . . _g_<i>n</i>eya_m<i>n</i>ri_shisvâdhyâye . . . _g_<i>n</i>eya_m_. In this case we should have to translate the quoted passage, ’. . . is to be understood with regard to the <i>Ri</i>shisvâdhyâya, i.e. to, &c.'—I think, however, that the true meaning of the Sûtra is different from what Nârâya<i>n</i>a believes it to be. The expression vyâkhyâtam apparently conveys a reference to another treatise in which the rules regarding the <i>Ri</i>shisvâdhyâya would seem to have been fully set forth. The <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra contains p. 73 no passage which could be the one here referred to; we may suppose, therefore, that either a chapter of a Prâti<i>n</i>âkhya is quoted here, or a separate treatise on the special subject of the <i>Ri</i>shisvâdhyâya. References to such treatises are found in the Sûtra texts in several instances, of which the most important is that in the Gobhila-G<i>n</i>hya I, 5, 13, ‘On what day the moon becomes full, the knowledge thereof is contained in a special text; that one either should study or ascertain when the Parvan is from those who have studied it.’

[^160]: 73:28 Nârâya<i>n</i>a: ‘First stand the Mantras, then the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, because it contains the viniyoga (the ritual use of the Mantras), then the Sm<i>n</i>ti texts such as Manu, &c. When he has repeated these texts to the student, after the end of the Anuvâ<i>n</i>ana, the teacher should take from the student the Ku<i>n</i>a blades which had been taken up before for the sake of the Anuvâ<i>n</i>ana (see Sûtras 5 seq.),’ &c.—The teacher is made the subject of this rule also by Râma<i>n</i>andra. On yathâsûktam Nârâya<i>n</i>a observes that according to some teachers these water oblations were directed to the _Ri<i>n</i>ri<i>n</i>s<i>n</i>k_it). This statement seems to be countenanced by IV, 6, 6. Comp. the note below on IV, 9, 1.

[^162]: 73:1 8, 1. This is the Anuprava<i>k</i>anîyahoma treated of by Â<i>k</i>valâyana at I, 22, 12 seq. There it is stated that this sacrifice should be performed as well after the recitation of the Sâvitrî as after the other p. 74 portions of the Veda, for instance, as the commentary there has it, after the Mahânâmnîs, the Mahâvrata, and the Upanishad have been recited. Nârâya<i>k</i>a indicates the time of this sacrifice in the words, ‘On that same fast-day (chap. 7, 29) in the afternoon.’

[^166]: 74:10\_1 10, 1. This Sûtra evidently should be placed at the end of the ninth chapter; comp. IV, 6, 9. The fact that, as the commentary observes, the words nitya_m<i> vâgyata</i>h_ (chap. 9, Sûtra 1) are to be p. 75 supplied here also points in the same direction. That this Sûtra has nothing to do with the Agnipari<i> vâgyata</i>aryâ, of which the tenth chapter treats, becomes evident also from Râma<i> vâgyata</i>andra's Paddhati.

[^167]: 75:4 Nârâya<i>n</i>a: samidham iti mantraliṅgât samidhâ_m<i>n</i>h_, mantrap<i>n</i>thaktvât karmap<i>n</i>thaktvam iti nyâyât.

In the Atharva-veda XIX, 64, 1 the MSS. have Agne samidham âhârsham. Professors Roth and Whitney have conjectured in this passage agre instead of Agne. It is shown by our passage and the corresponding ones in the other Sûtras that the true reading is Agnaye. Instead of ahârsham we should read âhârsham, as all the parallel texts have. In the passage ‘Firewood art thou; might we prosper,’ there is a play upon words untranslatable in English, ‘edhoऽsy edhishîmahi.’ Perhaps instead of samiddho mâ_m<i> samardhaya we should read sam</i>ri<i> samardhaya we should read sam</i>m_ samardhaya. As the Mantra referred to the Samidh-offering, sam<i> samardhaya we should read sam</i>ddha could very easily be supplanted by the participle of sam-idh. In the parallel texts indicated p. 139 of the German edition it should be, Vâ_g_. Sa<i> samardhaya we should read sam</i>h. II, 14 a.

[^168]: 76:7 This Sûtra is wanting in one of the Haug MSS. and in the <i>S</i>âmbavya MS.; Râma<i>k</i>andra's Paddhati takes no notice of it. I take it for a later addition. It should be noticed that the words dakshi<i>k</i>askandhe . . . _k<i>k</i>ñ_<i>k</i>asu form a half <i>S</i>loka.

  On kâlaniyama_m_, see Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note, pp. 140 seq. of the German edition.

[^177]: 78:1 12, 1 seq. The Indian tradition (with the exception only, as far as is known to me, of the <i>S</i>âmbavya commentary) refers the ceremonies described in this chapter, like those treated of in chap. 11, as well to the _S<i>ukriya as to the </i>S_âkvara and the other Vratas. This is not correct. The eleventh chapter gives the rites common to the four Vratas; the <i>S</i>ukriya vrata is connected with no special ceremonies beside those, so that the exposition of this Vrata is brought to an end in that chapter. The last Sûtra of chap. 11 marks the transition to the special rites which are peculiar to the three other Vratas, and are connected with the character of mystical secrecy attributed to the Âra<i>ukriya as to the </i>yaka, and thus it is with the exclusion of the Sukriya that the twelfth chapter refers only to those Vratas. The difference which we have pointed out between the two chapters finds its characteristic expression in Sûtras 9 and 11 of chap. 11, compared with chap. 12, 13. 14; in the former Sûtras the statements there given are expressly extended to the Sukriya, the <i>S</i>âkvara, the Vrâtika, and the Aupanishada, while in the latter passage mention is made first of the Mahânâmnîs, i.e. the text corresponding to the <i>S</i>âkvara vrata, and then the uttarâ<i>ukriya as to the </i>i prakara<i>ukriya as to the </i>âni (the following sections) are referred to, i.e. the Mahâvrata and the Upanishad, so that the Sukriya vrata or the texts, the study of which is entered upon by that Vrata, are left out here.
  There is a good deal of confusion in the several commentaries p. 79 with regard to the succession of the different ceremonies taught in this chapter. They all agree in stating that after the lapse of the year through which the Vrata is kept, a ceremony is performed called Uddîksha<i>n</i>ikâ, i.e. the giving up of the Dîkshâ, or preparatory observance. This Uddîksha<i>n</i>ikâ consists chiefly in the teacher's ascertaining whether the student has fulfilled the duties involved by the Vrata (see Sûtras 2 and 3). Besides that, there is no doubt that a repetition of the Upanayana (chap. 11, 2) also formed part of the preparatory rites for the study of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka. As to the way in which these different ceremonies and the other rites described in this chapter would have to be arranged according to our text, it is perhaps best to follow the statements given in an epitome from the bâlâvabodhanârtham _Ri<i>n</i>kh_andopaddhati (MS. Berol. Chambers, 199 a, fols. 13-16); the slight confusion therein is not difficult to get rid of. There we read, ‘The <i>S</i>âkvara, however, is to be kept one year (chap. 11, 11). When the Uddîksha<i>n</i>ikâ has been performed, and three nights (chap. 12, 6) or one day and one night (ibid. 7) have elapsed, the Upanayana should be performed as above (chap. 11, 2), with this difference that at the end of the formula mama vrate, &c. (chap. 4, 1) one should say, “May B<i>n</i>haspati join thee to me for the holy observance of the <i>S</i>âkvara through one year, O Devadatta!” (On this formula, resting on a misunderstanding of chap. 4, Sûtra 2, see the Introduction, p. 8.) The rest is the same as at the <i>S</i>ukriya. Then, when the year (chap. 11, 11) has elapsed, and the Uddîksha<i>n</i>ikâ has been performed, and the three days or the night have passed (chap. 12, 6. 7), he should go out of the village . . . and in the north-eastern direction,’ &c. (here follows the description of how the secret doctrines should be taught to the student, according to <i>S</i>âṅkh. VI). The confusion showing itself in the double mention of the Uddîksha<i>n</i>ikâ, before and after the Upanayana, should no doubt be put to the account of the excerptor or perhaps even of the MS.; what the meaning of the original Paddhati was is sufficiently shown in the remarks on the following Vratas, for instance, on the Vrâtika (fol. 16), ‘Now follows the Vrâtika vrata. It lasts one year (chap. p. 80 11, 12). When the <i>S</i>âkvara has reached its end \[here we find added at the margin of the MS.,“ After the Uddîksha<i>n</i>ikâ has been performed.” These words ought not to be received into the text; in the corresponding passage on the Aupanishada vrata they are not found\] he performs the whole ceremony, beginning from the smearing (of the Stha<i>nd</i>ila with cow-dung), the drawing of the lines, &c., as at the Upanayana . . . and then, when one year has elapsed, he performs the Uddîksha<i>n</i>ikâ, and the rules \[given in chap. 12, 9 seq.\] are observed as above.’ I think that here the meaning of the text is correctly represented; first comes the Upanayana, then follows the Vrata lasting one year, then the Uddîksha<i>n</i>ikâ. After this ceremony the teacher gives to the student the directions mentioned in chap. 12, 16; then follow the three days, or the one night (chap. 12, 6. 7), and finally they both go out of the village to the north-east, and in the forest they recite the Rahasya.

On the whole ceremonies connected with the study of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka the sixth book should be compared.

[^179]: 80:6 The things which the student here is ordered to leave off for three days are the same that are mentioned above, chap. 6, 8, as his standing duties. According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a this would be the Âde<i>n</i>a mentioned in chap. II, 13.

[^181]: 81:10 With Sûtikâ is meant a woman during the first ten days after her confinement, for which period the a<i>s</i>au<i>s</i>a lasts.—Apahasta is rendered by Nârâya<i>s</i>a by <i>kh</i>innahasta; the comment on the <i>S</i>âmbavya-G<i>s</i>hya mentions âyudhâṅkitahastâ<i>s</i>_s<i>s</i>k_a. The translation of the last words of this Sûtra (sarvâ<i>s</i>i _k<i>s</i>s<i>s</i>n_i yâny âsye na \[or âsyena?\] pravi<i>s</i>eyu<i>h</i> svasya vâsân nirasan) is absolutely uncertain. Nârâya<i>s</i>a says that such animals as lions, serpents, &c. are designated in common use as _s<i>s</i>n_i. (This literally means, ‘having the form of a corpse.’ Immediately afterwards Nârâya<i>s</i>a gives a nearly identical explanation of <i>kh</i>avarûpa as different from the one stated first. So perhaps we may conjecture that his first explanation rests on a reading sarparûpâ<i>s</i>i; comp. the reading sarvarûpa of Pâraskara.) Of these the animals entering their dwelling-places with the mouth first (âsyena) are to be understood here as forming, when looked at, an impediment for the study. Nârâya<i>s</i>a then says that other authorities understand <i>kh</i>ava in the sense of a dead human body; then _s<i>s</i>n<i>s</i>n_i), such as dogs, jackals, &c. The words yâny âsyena pravi<i>s</i>eyu<i>h</i> signify that the study is impeded also on the sight of lions, tigers, &c.; for these enter their dwelling-places with their faces first (? anumukhai_h<i>s</i>ri_tvâ). The words svasya vâsân nirasan mean, p. 82 according to Nâr., ‘when he—i.e. the teacher—goes out of his dwelling-place.’ Râma<i>s</i>andra says that <i>kh</i>avarûpa either means lions, snakes, and other dangerous animals, or nails, horns, and other such things that fall off or are severed from the body. The text of the <i>S</i>âmbavya MS. is sarvâ<i>s</i>i _k<i>s</i>s<i>s</i>n_i yâvânyâ (?) pravi<i>s</i>eyu_h_, which the commentary explains, sarvâ<i>s</i>_s<i>s</i>k<i>s</i>m__s<i>s</i>k_a. I think there can be little doubt that the text of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana is correct (except that some doubt will remain as to âsyena or âsye na), the more so as the passage reoccurs, nearly identically, below at VI, 1, 4. 5. As to the translation we can only go so far as to venture the opinion that the _S<i>s</i>G_ayarâma, and accepted by Professor Stenzler (who compares Âpastamba I, 11, 27; Gautama XVI, 41) in Pâraskara II, 11, 3 for sarvarûpa, which consequently should, in our opinion, be rejected also in that passage of Pâraskara. For ascertaining the true meaning of <i>kh</i>avarûpa we shall have to wait until new parallel passages have been discovered.

[^187]: 84:1 14, 1. The rules regarding the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva sacrifice stand here, as I have already pointed out in the German edition, p. 142, in a very strange position amid the matter that concerns the student, and before the description of the ceremony that concludes studentship (the Samâvartana; III, 1). On the first word of the chapter, atha, Nârâya<i>s</i>a observes that thereby the householder is marked as the subject of the following rules. It seems rather forced to explain the position of this chapter, as Nârâya<i>s</i>a does, by pointing out that in some cases, for instance when the teacher is away on a journey, a student also can eventually be called upon to perform the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva sacrifice (comp. below, chap. 17, 3).

[^188]: 84:2 This Sûtra shows, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, that the Vai<i>n</i>vadeva offering does not follow the ordinary type of sacrifice (the Prati<i>n</i>rute homakalpa, as it is termed above, I, 9, 19), but the form described in the Agnikâryaprakara<i>n</i>a, above, chap. 10, 3 seq.

[^189]: 85:6-7 6, 7. The distribution of Balis begins in the east, which is the part of the horizon sacred to Indra; it then proceeds to the south, the west, the north, which are sacred respectively to Yama, Varu<i>n</i>a, and Soma. Finally the Bali belonging to B<i>n</i>haspati and the Bârhaspatyas is offered, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, to the north-east.

[^190]: 85:8 The commentators (see p. 142 of the German edition) differ as to whether âdityama<i>nd</i>ala means the disk of the sun towards which this Bali should be offered, or a place or an apartment of circular form (âdityama<i>nd</i>alarûpe ma<i>nd</i>alâgâre, as in my opinion we ought to correct the reading in Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note).

This Sûtra presupposes the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra IV, 21, 1: ‘To six persons the Argha reception is due, viz. to the teacher, to an officiating priest, to the father-in-law, to a king, to a Snâtaka, to a friend.’ Here the fourth person mentioned is the _s<i>va</i>s_ura, while in the G<i>va</i>hya text the expression vaivâhya is used. It is difficult not to believe that both words are used in the same sense, and accordingly Nârâya<i>va</i>a says vivâhya_h<i>va</i>s<i>va</i>s<i>va</i>h_. Comp. Professor Stenzler's note on Pâraskara I, 3, 1; Âpastamba II, 8, 7; Gautama V, 27.

[^195]: 87:2-3 2, 3. These Sûtras are identical with Pâraskara I, 3, 29. 30. The following Sûtra of Pâraskara stands in the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana text as p. 88 Sûtra 10. Probably Pâraskara here represents the text which both Sûtrakâras follow, more exactly, and the enumeration given by <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana in Sûtras 4-9 of the different categories of Arghyas with the corresponding deities, is an addition to that original stock of rules.
  Apparently the two Sûtras 2 and 3 stand in contradiction to each other, as Sûtra 2 seems to prescribe that at the Argha meal in every case flesh should be given to the guest, and Sûtra 3 specifies only two occasions on which the killing of the Argha cow cannot be dispensed with. Perhaps the meaning is this, that it is not necessary, except in the cases of a sacrifice and of a wedding, to kill a cow expressly for that purpose, but that in any case, even if the cow offered to the guest be declined by him, the host should take care that some flesh be served at that meal. So says Nârâya<i>n</i>a in his note on Â<i>n</i>valâyana-G<i>n</i>hya I, 24, 33, ‘Pa<i>n</i>ukara<i>n</i>apakshe tanmâ<i>n</i>sena bho<i>n</i>anam, utsar<i>n</i>anapakshe mâ<i>n</i>santare<i>n</i>a.’ Similarly the Buddhists distinguish between eating flesh and eating the flesh of an animal expressly killed in order to entertain that very guest.

[^196]: 88:6 The literal translation of vaivâhya would be ‘a person related by marriage.’ But comp. the note on Sûtra 1.
