The short treatise of Âpastamba on the G<i>ri</i>hya ritual forms one Pra<i>ri</i>na of the great corpus of the Âpastambîya-Kalpa-sûtra (see Sacred Books, vol. ii, p. xii) and stands, among the G<i>ri</i>hya texts, in closest connection with the Hira<i>ri</i>yake<i>ri</i>i-G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra. The chief difference between these two Sûtras, both belonging to the Taittirîya School of the Black Ya<i>ri</i>ur-veda, consists herein, that Âpastamba, just as has been stated above [^711] with regard to Gobhila, gives only the rules for the performance of the G<i>ri</i>hya rites without the Mantras, which are contained in a special collection, the Mantrapâ<i>ri</i>a, standing by the side of the Sûtras: Hira<i>ri</i>yake<i>ri</i>in, on the other hand, follows the more usual practice, as adopted by <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, Â<i>ri</i>valâyana, Pâraskara, of interweaving the description of the ceremonies with the text of the corresponding Mantras. As to the relation in which the Âpastambîya-sûtras stand to the Mantrapâ<i>ri</i>a, there is, so far as I can see, no reason why we should not extend the theory which we have tried to establish with regard to Gobhila, to the evidently parallel case of Âpastamba: the Sûtras presuppose the existence of the Mantrapâ<i>ri</i>a, just as the latter text seems to presuppose the Sûtras.—The questions regarding the historical relation of Âpastamba to Hira<i>ri</i>yake<i>ri</i>in have been treated of by Professor Bühler in his Introduction to Âpastamba's Dharma-sûtra, S.B.E., vol. ii, pp. xxiii seq.

I have here to thank Dr. Winternitz, to whom we are indebted for an excellent edition of the Âpastambîya-G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra, for having placed at my disposal, before publication, <span id="p250">[<sup><small>p. 250</small></sup>]</span> the proof-sheets of his edition, and for lending me his copy of the Mantrapâ<i>ri</i>a as well as of the commentary of Haradatta. The kindness of the same scholar has enabled me to make use of Professor Eggeling's copy of the first part of Sudar<i>ri</i>anârya's commentary and of his own copy of the second part of the same work.
