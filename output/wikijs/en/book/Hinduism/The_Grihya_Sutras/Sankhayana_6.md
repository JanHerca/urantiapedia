## ADHYÂYA VI, KHA<i>ND</i>A 1.

1\. [^319]. Now, after having paid reverence to Brahman, to the Brahma<i>ri</i>shi, to (those who descend from) Brahman's womb, to Indra, Pra<i>ri</i>âpati, Vasish<i>ri</i>a, Vâmadeva, Kahola Kaushîtaki, Mahâkaushîtaki, Suya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, Â<i>ri</i>valâyana, Aitareya, Mahaitareya, Kâtyâyana, _S<i>ri</i>t_yâyana, _S_âkalya, Babhru, Bâbhravya, Ma<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>u, Mâ<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>avya, and to all the teachers of the past, we will henceforth explain the rules for the Âra<i>ri</i>yaka as forming the subject of Svâdhyâya (private recitation of a text).

2\. [^320]. The teacher abstains through one day and one night from sexual intercourse and from eating flesh.

3\. [^321]. Raw flesh, a Ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>âla, a woman that has lately been confined, or that has her courses, seeing blood or persons whose hands have been cut off: (these persons and things he shall know form) impediments for the study.

4\. And of the corpse-like (animals?).

5\. Those which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?). <span id="p142">[<sup><small>p. 142</small></sup>]</span>

6 [6](sbe29094.htm#fn323). When he has vomited, or when his beard has been shaved,

7\. [7](sbe29094.htm#fn324). When he has eaten flesh or partaken of a _S_râddha or birth dinner,

8\. During the days that immediately follow on (days of) study in the village,

9\. Three nights (and days), if (he has been) put out of order,

10\. (Or has been violently) seized by others,

11\. And during the second half of the days that precede (?) the Parvan days,

12\. And if fire-flames, lightning, thunder, (heavy) rains, and great clouds appear,

13\. And if a storm (blows) that carries away pebbles, as long as that lasts.

2\. 1. During four months after the full moon of Âshâ<i>dh</i>a let him not study.

2\. [^322]. Especially the _S_akvarî verses (are concerned by what has been declared). Such are the rules.


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 2.

3\. [^325]. Let them go to a clean spot in the north-eastern direction, that receives its light from the east.

4\. The drawing of water (should be done) before sunrise, <span id="p143">[<sup><small>p. 143</small></sup>]</span>

5 [^326]. And the entering into the circle with this verse, ‘She who smells of salve’ (Rig-veda X, 146, 6).

6\. [^327]. The circle should have its entrance to the east or to the north; it should be (praised as) excellent among the people, not too spacious, not too narrow.

7\. [^328]. The final expiation (should extend) to the Vâmadevya.

8\. And the invitation to resume the recitation (is done in the following way)

9\. After they have sipped water that stands outside the circle,

10\. Let them resume the recitation, having performed the expiation.

11\. If the vessel used in the expiation is damaged, sprinkling (with water forms) the expiatory act (to be performed for it).

12\. (That) sprinkling, however, (one should perform) holding gold or a bunch of Darbha grass in his hand.

13\. So far what pertains to the general rules.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 3.

1\. Now after they have entered the circle—

2\. [^329]. The teacher sits down with his face to the east, the others, according to their rank, (sit down) towards the south, with their faces to the north. <span id="p144">[<sup><small>p. 144</small></sup>]</span>

3\. If that is impossible, with their faces to all directions.

4\. Let them expect the rising of the sun,

5\. And when they behold it in its splendour,

6\. [^330]. Let them with (the words), ‘Recite, sir!’ seize with their hands, holding the right hand uppermost, the feet of the teacher, which have been washed, with the right (hand) the right (foot), with the left the left,

7\. [^331]. And having then put (the hands) into the vessel used for the expiation, into water in which pieces of Dûrvâ stalks are, let them begin their study, when their hands have ceased to drip.

8\. This is the rite. But when they are tired, let one of them bring it about that the vessel used for the expiation be not empty.

9\. And all (should do so) at the beginning and the end of (each) Adhyâya.

10\. [^332]. (All) that is done continuously, without interruption.

11\. Now the expiation.

12\. [^333]. The syllable OM, the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, the Sâvitrî, the Rathantara, the B<i>ri</i>hat, the Vâmadevya; B<i>ri</i>hat and Rathantara with repetition and Kakubh-forming. <span id="p145">[<sup><small>p. 145</small></sup>]</span>

13 [^334]. These (holy words and verses) are (thus) made to attain (the number of) ten.

14\. [^335]. ‘Of decades consists the Virâ_g_’—thus says the Brâhma<i>n</i>a.


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 4.

1\. [^336]. ‘Unerring mind, vigorous eye (is) the sun, the noblest of the stars. Inauguration, do no harm to me!’—with (these words) they look at Savit<i>ri</i> (I.e. the sun). <span id="p146">[<sup><small>p. 146</small></sup>]</span>

2\. One (verse), ‘You both the gladdening one’ (Rig-veda X, 131, 4), and the three (verses), ‘Blessing to us on the paths’ (Rig-veda X, 63, 15-17) (are to be repeated before the recitation) of the Mahâvrata (chapter).

3\. But (at that) of the _S_akvarî (verses) before (the formula mentioned in the first Sara):

4\. [^337]. The three T<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>as, ‘To him, the thirsty one’ (Rig-veda VI, 42, 1-3), ‘The wealthiest (Soma), O wealthy one’ (VI, 44, 1-3), ‘Him who does no harm to you’ (VI, 44, 4-6), (the verse), ‘To him, to him the sap of the herb’ (VI, 42, 4), (and the verse), "Verily thou art a hero' (VIII, 81, 28)—thus for the _S_akvarî (verses) before and afterwards.

5\. Now for the Upanishad (texts)—

6\. The same (recitation) as for the Mahâvrata.

7\. [^338]. For the Sa<i>m</i>hitâs, however, before (the text given in the first Sûtra the formula has to be recited), ‘I shall speak right, I shall speak truth (&c.)’—this is the difference (in the case of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâs).

8\. [^339]. Now for the Mantha the two verses (have to be recited) before (the formula given in the first Sûtra), ‘This we entreat of Savitar,’ ‘That glorious (splendour) of Savitar’ (Rig-veda V, 82, 1; III, 62, 10). <span id="p147">[<sup><small>p. 147</small></sup>]</span>

9\. With (the formula), ‘Unerring mind’ (see Sûtra 1), then follow the expiatory formulas that belong to the (different) sections.

10\. (All) this on one day.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 5.

Kha<i>n</i><i>n</i>a 4, 11 [^340]. Now if the time for rising has come, they drive away (all) evil,

12\. Perform the standing expiation,

13\. And look at the sun with (the words), ‘From here I take out the brightness (?).’

Kha<i>n</i><i>n</i>a 5, 1 [^341]. ‘That (I place) within myself’—with (these words they turn their thoughts to the universal) Self that is placed (within themselves?)three times repeated (?).

2\. With (the formula), 'May happiness rejoice in me and glory; may happiness rejoice with me and glory;—

3\. ‘Together with Indra, with the hosts, with power, with glory, with strength I will rise’—he rises up. <span id="p148">[<sup><small>p. 148</small></sup>]</span>

4\. ‘May happiness rise to me; may glory rise to me’—when he has risen.

5\. ‘Hereby I shake off the hater, the rival, the evil one, and the bringer of misfortune’—with (this formula) having shaken the end of the garment,—

6\. The hymn, ‘Away those to the east’ (Rig-veda X, 131), the two (verses), ‘And may Indra have mercy upon us’ (II, 41, 11. 12), the one (verse), ‘Of what we are in fear, O Indra’ (VIII, 50, 13)—(when these texts have been murmured), they look with (the verse), ‘A ruler indeed, great art thou’ (X, 152, 1) to the east; with (the verse), ‘The giver of bliss’ (X, 152, 2) to the south, turned to the right; with (the verse), ‘Away the Rakshas’ (X, 152, 3) to the west; with (the verse), ‘Destroy, O Indra, our’ (X, 152, 4) to the north, turned to the left; with (the verse), ‘Away, O Indra’ (X, 152, 5) to the sky, turned to the right.


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 6.

1\. Having worshipped the Sun with (the verses), ‘Savit<i>ri</i> from the west,’ ‘This eye’ (Rig-veda X, 36, 14; VII, 66, 16),

2\. [^342]. They turn away, come back, sit down.

3\. With (the words), ‘As the water is appeased’—they draw water out of the vessel used for the expiation,

4\. Pour it out on the ground,

5\. [^343]. Spread (some) of that (water over the ground) with (the words), ‘As the earth (is appeased),’— <span id="p149">[<sup><small>p. 149</small></sup>]</span>

6 [^344]. He (then) smears it on his right shoulder with (the words), ‘Thus may peace dwell in me.’

7\. In the same way a second time.

8\. In the same way a third time.

9\. ‘Piece by piece thou art produced; piece by piece thou risest up; bring welfare to us, O house!’—with (this text they) take pieces of Dûrvâ stalks (out of the vessel of water), put them on their heads,

10\. [^345]. (And make water-offerings with the formulas), ‘May Agni satiate himself; may Vâyu satiate himself; may Sûrya satiate himself; may Vish<i>n</i>u satiate himself; may Pra<i>n</i>âpati satiate himself; may Virûpâksha satiate himself; may Sahasrâksha satiate himself; may all beings satiate themselves.’

11\. [^346]. (Then) Sumantu, _G_aimini, Vai<i>s</i>ampâyana, Paila, and the other teachers (receive their offerings).

12\. [^347]. (Then) every one (worships in the same way) his fathers.

13\. With (the text), ‘To the sea you’ (<i>S</i>raut. IV, 11, 11) they pour out the water,

14\. Murmur the Vâmadevya,

15\. And separate according to their pleasure.

16\. (The final benedictory formula runs thus), ‘Through the power of wisdom, of <i>S</i>ruti and Sm<i>ri</i>ti, as handed down by tradition, through (that power) which has its measure in (the Vedic texts) that have been gone through(?), and which is possessed of <span id="p150">[<sup><small>p. 150</small></sup>]</span> undisputed firmness, may peace be with us in welfare. Adoration be to gods, _Ri_shis, Manes, and men! May they whom we have adored, make happy life, beauty, health, peace, incolumity, imperishableness, vigour, splendour, glory, power, holy lustre, renown, age, offspring, cattle, adoration, increase. From wrongly spoken, wrongly used (prayer), from everything that is deficient or excessive, for the good of gods and _Ri_shis, may the Brahman and Truth protect me; may the Brahman and Truth protect me!’

End of the Sixth Adhyâya.

End of the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya.

## Footnotes

[^320]: 141:1 1, 1 seqq. Comp. the general remarks on this sixth book in the Introduction, [p. 11](sbe29002.htm#p11).

For the names in the opening invocation, comp. above, 1V, 10; on the Vratas and the study of the different Âra<i>n</i>yaka sections chiefly treated of in this book, see above, II, 11. 12, and the Introduction, [p. 8](sbe29002.htm#p8).

[^321]: 141:2 Comp. II, 11, 6.

[^322]: 141:3-5 Comp. II, 12, 10, and the note of Nârâya<i>n</i>a, p. 160 of the German edition.

[^325]: 142:2 2, 2. It seems to me that this Sûtra should be divided into two (after _s<i>akvarya</i>h_), so that the words iti niyamâ<i>h</i> would correspond to iti bhâshikam, chap. 2, 13.

[^323]: 142:6 Comp. IV, 7, 42. See also Ait. Âra<i>n</i>yaka V, 3, 9.

[^324]: 142:7 Comp. IV, 7, 5.

[^326]: 142:3 Comp. II, 12, 11. Perhaps the Petersburg Dictionary is right in proposing for prâg<i>g</i>yotisham the translation, vor Anbruch des Lichtes. Nârâya<i>g</i>a says, prâk purastât <i>g</i>yotir yasmin tam . . . prade<i>g</i>am.

[^327]: 143:5 The Ma<i>n</i><i>n</i>ala is a circular space marked by a line of water.

[^328]: 143:6 I am doubtful whether we should read vâ <i>g</i>anâgrîyam and translate as I have done in accordance with the note of Nârâya<i>n</i>a, or if the reading should be vâऽ<i>n</i>anâgrîyam, ‘not in the presence of people,’ so that _g<i>n</i>g_anânâm agre.

[^329]: 143:7 On the expiation (_s_ânti) comp. chap. 3, 12.

[^330]: 143:2-3 3, 2, 3. Comp. IV, 8, 2-4.

[^331]: 144:6 Comp. above, II, 5, 10, &c.

[^332]: 144:7 The translation of apinvamânai_h<i> pâ</i>n<i> pâ</i>h_ is conjectural. Nârâya<i> pâ</i>a's explanation of apinvamâna by asa<i> pâ</i>s<i> pâ</i>sh<i> pâ</i>a is inadmissible.

[^333]: 144:10 Nârâya<i>n</i>a explains this Sûtra in the following way. if it is impossible, for any reason, to recite the whole text, only the beginning and the concluding words of each Adhyâya (see Sûtra 9) are to be repeated; and these should be recited without interruption so as to form one continual text.

[^334]: 144:12 Comp. above, III, 4, 5.

[^335]: 145:13 The Gâyatrî is one verse; the Rathantara and the B<i>ri</i>hat are Pragâthas which are changed in the usual way into T<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>as; the Vâmadevya is one T<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a: thus the number of ten is obtained.

[^336]: 145:14 Kaush. Brâhma<i>n</i>a 17, 3; 19, 5.

[^337]: 145:1 4, 1. The formula ‘Adabdha_m<i> mana</i>h_,’ &c. has to be recited before each of the single Âra<i> mana</i>yaka texts (the _S_akvarî verses, the Mahâvrata, &c.); to this formula are added, before or after it, as the case may be, other texts specified in the Sûtras 2-8. Of these there can be no doubt about the meaning of Sûtras 7, 8, treating of the introductory formulas of the Sa<i> mana</i>hitâ section (Kaush. Âr. VII-VIII) and of the Mantha section (ibid. IX): before the text adabdham, &c. are to be added, in the first case the formula _ri<i> mana</i>m_ vadishyâmi, &c., in the second case two _Ri_<i> mana</i>as addressed to Savit_ri_. These formulas and verses have been received into the Âra<i> mana</i>yaka text and are found there in the order here stated, at the beginning of books VII and IX. The meaning of the words sa<i> mana</i>hitânâ<i>m</i> tu pûrvam (Sûtra 7) having thus been established, I can see no reason why we should not interpret the words _s<i> mana</i>n<i> mana</i>m_ to pûrvam (Sûtra 3) quite in the same way. Thus the introductory benediction for the recital of the _S_akvarî verses would consist, firstly of the verses stated in Sûtra 4, then of the formula adabdham, &c.; those verses would have to be repeated again after the _S_akvarî verses (end of Sûtra 4). The recitation of the Mahâvrata (Sûtras 1, 2) and of the Upanishads (Sûtra 5) is preceded by adabdham, &c., and then by the four verses stated in Sûtra 2. The interpretation which Nârâya<i> mana</i>a gives of this Sûtra is not quite the same as that which I have here proposed; see p. 163 of the German edition.

[^338]: 146:4 According to the reading of some MSS. we should have to translate, or (the verse), ‘Verily,’ &c.

[^339]: 146:7 On the Sa<i>m</i>hitâs (Kaush. Âr. VII, VIII) see Max Müller, Rig-veda Prâti<i>m</i>âkhya, pp. 4 seq.; Ait. Âra<i>m</i>yaka III (pp. 305 seqq., ed. Bibl. Ind.; Sacred Books of the East, I, pp. 247 seq.).

[^340]: 146:8 Regarding the description of the Mantha sacrifice (Kaush. Âr. IX) which has to be performed by one who wishes to attain greatness, comp. _S_atap. Brâhma<i>n</i>a XIV, 9, 2; _Kh_ând. Up. V, 2, 4; Sacred Books of the East, I, p. 75.

[^341]: 147:11-12 11, 12. Nârâya<i>n</i>a has the following note: ‘The evil which is attached to their body, such as dirt, they drive away, i.e. they remove it by means of their reciting (of the sacred texts), and then they perform the standing expiation which has been declared above, which begins with the syllable Om and with the Mahâvyâh<i>n</i>tis’ (see chap. 3, 12).

[^342]: 147:1 5, 1. Nârâya<i>n</i>a says that dadhe is supplied to this Mantra from the preceding Sûtra, and so indeed the Mantra is given in the Aitareya recension. The translation of abhinihita<i>m</i> trir hitam is merely tentative; see Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note, p. 165, of the German edition. Perhaps abhinihita<i>m</i> should be taken in its grammatical value, and the Sûtra should be translated, “That (I place) into myself (âtmani)”—with these words (they look) at themselves, pronouncing (the word âtmani) with Abhinidhâna, three times repeated (?).' On abhinidhâna, comp. Professor Max Müller's edition of the Rig-veda Prâti<i>n</i>âkhya, pp. cxvii seqq.

[^343]: 148:2 6, 2. Nârâya<i>n</i>a explains vyâvartamânâ_h<i>n</i>h_.

[^344]: 148:5 Perhaps we should read asyâm (scil. p<i>ri</i>thivyâm) abhikarshanti, p. 149 and translate, ‘they draw (lines of that water) on this (earth).’

[^345]: 149:6 Nârâya<i>n</i>a says that all the students are to do so.

[^346]: 149:10 Comp. above, IV, 9. On the way in which this Tarpa<i>n</i>a is to be performed, Nârâya<i>n</i>a refers to the Sûtra II, 7, 5.

[^347]: 149:11 Comp. above, IV, 10.

[^348]: 149:12 Comp. above, IV, 10, 4-6.
