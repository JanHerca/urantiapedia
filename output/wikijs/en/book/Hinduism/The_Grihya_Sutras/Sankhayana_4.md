## ADHYÂYA IV, KHA<i>ND</i>A 1.

1\. [^230]. Let him offer (_S_râddha oblations) every month to the fathers.

2\. [^231]. Having invited an uneven number of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, versed in the Veda, at least three, to sit down as (representing) the fathers, <span id="p107">[<sup><small>p. 107</small></sup>]</span>

3\. And having strewn sesamum into an uneven number of water-pots,

4\. He shall pour them out over the hands of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, assigning (this gift) to them with the words, ‘N.N.! This to thee!’

5\. [^232]. After this they should be adorned;

6\. And after he has (respectfully) spoken to them, and has put food into the fire,

7\. Assigning (the food) to them with the words, ‘N.N.! This to thee!’ he shall cause them to eat.

8\. While they are eating, he shall murmur the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, the Sâvitrî, the Madhuvâtîya-verses (Rig-veda I, 90, 6 seq.), and verses addressed to the Manes and to (Soma) Pavamâna. <span id="p108">[<sup><small>p. 108</small></sup>]</span>

9 [^233]. When they have finished with eating, he shall offer the lumps (of flour).

10\. [^234]. Before (their dinner he shall offer) the lumps, according to some (teachers).

11\. Behind (these he places the lumps) for their wives, putting something between (these and the preceding ones).

12\. To the Brâhma<i>n</i>as he shall announce the remnants.

13\. [^235]. The rites of the putting (of food) into the fire (see Sûtra 6), &c. have been declared (in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra) by the Pi<i>n</i><i>n</i>apit<i>n</i>ya<i>n</i><i>n</i>a.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 2.

1\. [^236] Now (follows) the Ekoddish<i>t</i>a (i.e. the _S_râddha ceremony directed to a single dead person),

2\. With one strainer,

3\. [^237]. One (pot of) Argha-water,

4\. One lump (of flour).

5\. [^238]. No inviting (takes place here), nor the putting

<span id="p109">[<sup><small>p. 109</small></sup>]</span>

(of food) into the fire, nor (do) the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs (take part in this ceremony). ‘Relished?’—thus are they to be asked whether they are satiated. ‘May it approach (the fathers),’ instead of ‘imperishable.’

6\. ‘Be satisfied,’ when sending them away.

7\. Thus through one year, when one has died.

8\. [^239]. And (then) omission of the fourth one.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 3.

1\. [^240]. Now (follows) the Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>îkara<i>n</i>a (i.e. reception of a dead person into the community of Pi<i>n</i><i>n</i>a-offerings with the other Manes). <span id="p110">[<sup><small>p. 110</small></sup>]</span>

2 [^241]. When one year has elapsed, or three half-months,

3\. Or on a day when something good happens,

4\. He fills four water-pots with sesamum, scents, and water,

5\. Three for the fathers, one for the (newly) dead person,

6\. And pours the pot that belongs to the (newly) dead person out into the pots of the fathers with the two verses, ‘They who commonly’ (Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi Sa<i>g</i>hitâ XIX, 45. 46).

7\. Thus also the lump (of flour).

8\. This is the Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>îkara<i>n</i>a.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 4.

1\. [^242]. Now (follows) the Âbhyudayika (i.e. the _S_râddha ceremony referring to good luck). <span id="p111">[<sup><small>p. 111</small></sup>]</span>

2\. In the fortnight of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day,

3\. [^243]. After the sacrifice to the mothers has been performed,

4\. And an even number of (Brâhma<i>n</i>as) versed in the Veda have been invited to sit down;

5\. In the forenoon;

6\. [^244]. The rite is performed from left to right.

7\. [^245]. The murmuring with the omission of the verses belonging to the Manes.

8\. The Darbha blades are straight.

9\. [^246]. Barley is to be used instead of sesamum.

10\. The lumps are mixed with curds, jujube fruits, fried grain.

11\. [^247]. On inviting (the Manes, he should say), ‘The Nândîmukha (glad-faced?) Manes will I invite.’

12\. [^248]. ‘May the Nândîmukha Manes be rejoiced,’ instead of ‘imperishable.’

13\. [^249]. ‘The Nândîmukha Manes will I make speak,’ when he makes (the Brâhma<i>n</i>as) speak.

14\. [^250]. ‘(Was it) well done?’—thus are they to be asked whether they are satiated. <span id="p112">[<sup><small>p. 112</small></sup>]</span>

15\. The rest is the same (as in the other kinds of _S_râddha rites), as far as it is not [prohibited](errata.htm#0) (by contrary rules).

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 5.

1\. [^251]. Now (follows) the Upâkara<i>n</i>a (i.e. the ceremony by which the annual course of study is opened).

2\. [^252]. When the herbs appear, under the Nakshatra Hasta or _S<i>rava</i>n_a,

3\. Let him make oblations of the flour of fried barley and of grains, mixed with curds and ghee, with the (whole) Veda, verse by verse: thus say some (teachers).

4\. [^253]. Or with the first verses of the Sûktas and Anuvâkas.

5\. With the first verses of the Adhyâyas and of the sections belonging to the (different) _Ri_shis, according to Mâ<i>n</i><i>n</i>ûkeya.

6\. But Kaushîtaki has said:

7\. ‘I praise Agni the Purohita’ (Rig-veda I, 1, 1), this one verse,

8\. ‘The Kushumbhaka (mungoose?) has said it;’ ‘If thou criest, O bird, announce luck to us;’ ‘Sung by _G_amadagni;’ ‘In thy abode the whole world rests;’ <span id="p113">[<sup><small>p. 113</small></sup>]</span> ‘Come to our sacrifice, O you that are worthy of sacrifice, with care;’ ‘Whosoever, be he ours, be he alien;’ ‘Look on, look about;’ ‘Come here, Agni, the Maruts’ friend;’ ‘The oblation, O king, cooked for thee:’ each time two verses,

9\. [^254]. ‘That blessing and bliss we choose’—this one verse (the first and last verse of each Ma<i>n</i><i>n</i>ala).

10\. (Taking something) of the remnants of the sacrificed (food) they partake of that sacrificial food with this (verse), ‘I praised Dadhikrâvan’ (Rig-veda IV, 39, 6).

11\. They sip water, sit down,

12\. Murmur the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, the Sâvitrî, and the auspicious hymns commencing from the beginning of the Veda,

13\. And cause the teacher to pronounce auspicious wishes. <span id="p114">[<sup><small>p. 114</small></sup>]</span>

14\. Of this (ceremony) it is also said,

15\. 'Desirous (of acquiring) for the hymns inexhaustible vigour, reverence, and also soundness, the _Ri_shis, by the power of their austerities, have discovered the Upâkarman.

16\. [^255]. 'Therefore a constant performer of the six kinds of works should, in order that his Mantras might be successful, perform the Upâkarman—so they say—if he wishes for success of his (holy) works.

17\. [^256]. ‘At the time of the Upâkarman and of the Utsarga an interruption (of the Veda-study) shall take place for (three days and) three nights, likewise at the Ash<i>t</i>akâs for one day and one night, and so on the last night of each season.’

## KHA<i>ND</i>A. 6.

1\. [^257]. On the first day of the bright fortnight of Mâgha,

2\. To the north-east,

3\. In a place covered with herbs,

4\. Having murmured the hymns sacred to the Sun, ‘Upwards that _G_âtavedas’ (Rig-veda I, 50), ‘The bright face of the gods’ (I, 115), Adoration to Mitra's (eye)' (X, 37), ‘From the sky (where he dwells) may Sûrya protect us’ (X, 158), <span id="p115">[<sup><small>p. 115</small></sup>]</span>

5\. And having thrown clods of earth (on the ground) to the different quarters (of the horizon), from the left to the right, with the hymn, ‘A ruler indeed’ (Rig-veda X, 152), verse by verse,

6\. [^258]. And having satiated (with water) the _Ri_shis, the metres, the deities, faith and insight, and the fathers man by man,

7\. They interrupt (the study of) the hymns for six months and a half,

8\. Or for five and a half.

9\. But if they (wish to) recite them (nevertheless), let the recitation go on after a pause of one day and one night.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 7.

1\. Now the interruption (of the Veda recitation):—

2\. [^259]. In the case of prodigies until the same time (next day),

3\. And in the case of other miracles;

4\. In the case of lightning, thunder, and rains (the recitation shall be interrupted) till the twilight has thrice passed;

5\. At a _S_râddha-dinner for one day;

6\. [^260]. If a death (of relations) or birth has happened, for ten days;

7\. [^261]. On the fourteenth days (of the fortnights), the new moon days, and the Ash<i>t</i>akâ days, <span id="p116">[<sup><small>p. 116</small></sup>]</span>

8 [^262]. And on misty days.

9\. And when the teacher has died, for ten days;

10\. When he has heard of it, for three days;

11\. [^263]. And (on the death) of those whose family-head he is.

12\. On receiving (gifts) as at the _S_râddha.

13\. On (the death of) a fellow-student;

14\. When he has followed (the funeral of) a dead person,

15\. And when he has laid down the lumps of flour to the fathers.

16\. At night;

17\. During twilight;

18\. On the full and change of the moon;

19\. After sunset;

20\. In the neighbourhood of a _S_ûdra;

21\. [^264]. When the sound of a Sâman is heard;

22\. On a burial ground; <span id="p117">[<sup><small>p. 117</small></sup>]</span>

23 [^265]. In a wilderness which belongs to the village;

24\. In a village where a corpse is;

25\. On seeing forbidden sights;

26\. On hearing what is forbidden;

27\. On smelling a foul smell;

28\. If a high wind blows;

30\. On a carriage road;

31\. And while the sound of a lute is heard;

48\. With veiled hands;

49\. In an army;

50\. In presence of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who has not had his meal, and of cows (that have eaten nothing);

51\. When (these impediments) have passed, let them (continue to) recite (the Veda).

52\. Should any of these cases arise against his will, let him (continue to) recite after having held his breath and looked at the sun.

53\. [^268]. (The same rules hold good,) except (those regarding) lightning, thunder, and rain, for (the study of) the Kalpa. During the five months and a half (they have to behave) as while it rains.

54\. Thereof it is also said,

55\. [^269]. 'Food, water, roots and fruits, and whatsoever else _S_râddha-food there may be: even when he has (only) accepted thereof, the study should be interrupted; the Brâhma<i>n</i>a's hand is his mouth; so it is taught.’



<span id="p119">[<sup><small>p. 119</small></sup>]</span>

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 8.

‘I satiate the <i>S</i>ruti; I satiate the Sm<i>ri</i>ti; I satiate the firmness; I satiate the delight; I satiate <span id="p122">[<sup><small>p. 122</small></sup>]</span> the success; I satiate the thought; I satiate belief and insight, and the memory, cows and Brâhma<i>ri</i>as, movable and immovable things. All beings may satiate themselves!’—so far with the sacrificial cord suspended over the left shoulder.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 10.

7\. Let him not go to a sacrifice without being chosen (thereto).

## Footnotes

[^231]: 106:1 1, 1. Kha<i>n</i><i>n</i>as 1-4 contain the rules regarding the _S_râddha oblations directed to the Manes. The dinners offered in connection with these _S_râddha sacrifices to Brâhma<i>n</i>as and also—though of this of course no notice is taken in Vedic texts—to _S<i>n</i>n_as stood in the first line among the exhibitions of liberality of lay people towards priests and monks. Thus we find among the stock phrases that constantly reoccur in the Pâli Pi<i>n</i>akas, the mention of Sama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as ‘who have eaten the food given to them out of faith’ (saddhâdeyyâni bho<i>n</i>anâni bhu<i>n</i><i>n</i>itvâ)—wherein the ‘food given out of faith’ (saddhâdeyya) either chiefly or exclusively means the _S_râddha dinners, which are so called because the sacrificer gives them ‘full of faith’ (_s_raddhâsamanvita, Manu III, 275) to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and through them to the Manes.

The principal form of _S_râddha is that treated of in chap. 1, which is designated in other texts (see, for instance, Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 7, 1) as pârva<i>ri</i>a <i>s</i>râddha. There are, however, besides the parvan of the new moon, other times also considered as admissible for the performing of this monthly _S_râddha; see Gautama XV, 2 seq.; Âpastamba II, 16, &c.; and comp. on the _S_râddhas in general the passages quoted by Professor Jolly, Das Dharma-sûtra des Vish<i>ri</i>u (Sitzung der Bair. Akademie, phil. Classe, 7 Juni, 1879), pp. 46 seq.; Max Müller, ‘India, what can it teach us?’ pp. 234 Seq., 374 seq.

[^232]: 106:2 ‘“As the fathers” means: he invites the youngest, middle-aged, and eldest Brâhma<i>n</i>as to sit down in the place of the father, the grandfather, and the great-grandfather’ (Nârâya<i>n</i>a). A similar explanation of pit<i>n</i>vat is mentioned by Nârâya<i>n</i>a on Â<i>n</i>valâyana-G<i>n</i>hya p. 107 IV, 7, 2. My German translation of this Sûtra ought to be altered accordingly.

Besides the Brâhma<i>n</i>as mentioned in this Sûtra, who represent the fathers, according to all the commentaries, other Brâhma<i>n</i>as had to be invited as representing the Vi<i>n</i>ve devâs. Nârâya<i>n</i>a gives detailed statements as to the number of the pait<i>n</i>ka and of the daivika Brâhma<i>n</i>as to be invited, and though at first sight a European reader would rather be inclined to doubt whether at the _S_râddha ceremony, as the author of the text intended to describe it, any Brâhma<i>n</i>as at all had to be present except the pait<i>n</i>kas, the Sûtra 2, 5 shows that the commentators are quite right in their statements regarding both categories of Brâhma<i>n</i>as.

[^233]: 107:5-7 It would be more natural to alter the division of the Sûtras, so as to bring âmantrya in the fifth, anna_ñ<i>n</i>k_a in the seventh Sûtra. In this case we should have to translate: 5. After this, having (respectfully) spoken to them who have been adorned (by him with flowers, ornaments, &c.); 6. And having put (food) into the fire, 7. And having assigned the food to them, &c., he shall cause them to eat.—The respectful address mentioned in the fifth Sûtra consists, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, in the announcement, ‘Ye Brâhma<i>n</i>as, I will put (food) into the fire!’ (comp. Â<i>n</i>v.-G<i>n</i>hya IV, 7, 18), which he subsequently does with the formulas, ‘To Agni Kavyavâhana svâhâ! To Soma Pit<i>n</i>mat svâhâ! To Yama Aṅgirasvat Pit<i>n</i>mat svâhâ!’ Comp. Baudhâyana II, 1 4, 8.

[^234]: 108:9 As to the way in which the Pi<i>n</i><i>n</i>as should he offered, Nârâya<i>n</i>a refers to the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra (IV, 4).

[^235]: 108:10-11 10, 11. Pi<i>n</i><i>n</i>ân evidently belongs to the tenth Sûtra, not, as the Indian tradition takes it, to the eleventh. Between the Pi<i>n</i><i>n</i>as of the fathers and those belonging to the mothers he puts, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, for instance, Darbha grass.

[^236]: 108:13 <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra IV, 3 seq.

[^237]: 108:1 2, 1. Eka uddish<i>t</i>o yasmin _s<i>t</i>t_am (Nâr.). This is the kind of _S_râddha sacrifice which is to be performed for one twice-born during the first year after his death; see Manu III, 247; Yâ<i>t</i><i>t</i>avalkya I, 250.

[^238]: 108:3 This rule about the Argha water corresponds to those given with regard to the Pârva<i>n</i>a _S_râddha in the Sûtras 3 and 4 of the preceding chapter.

[^239]: 108:5 ‘Because the âvâhana (inviting) is forbidden here, it follows p. 109 that it must take place at the Pârva<i>n</i>a _S_râddha’ (Nâr.). According to Râma<i>n</i>andra's Paddhati he shall say to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, ‘I will invite hither the fathers;’ and when they give their consent, he invites them with Rig-veda X, 16, 12. Comp. Yâ<i>n</i><i>n</i>avalkya I, 232 seq., &c. Regarding the Vi<i>n</i>ve devâs comp. the note on chap. 1, 2; as to the t<i>n</i>ptapra<i>n</i>na (the question whether they are satiated) comp. Manu III, 251; Yâ<i>n</i>_ñ_. I, 240. At the Pârva<i>n</i>a _S_râddha, after the Brâhma<i>n</i>as have finished their dinner and rinsed their mouths, and after the Pi<i>n</i><i>n</i>as have been offered, the sacrificer says, ‘May what has been given at this _S_râddha to our father N.N., who belongs to the gotra N.N., be imperishable!’ (comp. Yâ<i>n</i>_ñ_. I, 242.) This phrase is to be altered at the Ekoddish<i>n</i>a _S_râddha in the way indicated in this Sûtra.

[^240]: 109:8 After the Ekoddish<i>t</i>a _S_râddha has been performed for a dead person during the first year after his death, he is to be admitted, by the Sapi<i>t</i><i>t</i>îkara<i>t</i>a ceremony, among the other Manes, and receives thenceforward his Pi<i>t</i><i>t</i>a together with them at the ordinary Pârva<i>t</i>a _S_râddha. As the ritual of this _S_râddha requires that the number of the ‘fathers’ worshipped should be three, the accession of a new person makes necessary the omission of the pra-pra-pitâmaha, who has now become fourth among the fathers.

[^241]: 109:1 3, 1. It appears to me that this whole chapter is a later addition to the original text. The last Sûtra of the preceding chapter, treating of the omission of the fourth ‘father,’ which forms, as shown in the preceding note, a consequence of the Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>îkara<i>n</i>a, p. 110 supposes this ceremony to be known and to require no special explanation. Had the intention of the author been to treat of the Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>îkara<i>n</i>a, this would have been the right place for mentioning the <i>k</i>aturthavisarga, and not, as we really read it, the end of the chapter treating of the Ekoddish<i>n</i>a. As pointing in the same direction I will mention that the _S_âmbavya-G<i>n</i>hya, while giving the first, second, and fourth chapter of this Adhyâya, omits the third. Finally it seems decisive to me that the fifth (Pari<i>n</i>ish<i>n</i>a) book of the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>n</i>hya treats of the Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>îkara<i>n</i>a in a whole chapter (V, 9), which shows that the text itself, as the author of the Pari<i>n</i>ish<i>n</i>a read it, gave no exposition of this ceremony.

[^242]: 110:2 Nârâya<i>n</i>a says that tripaksha means either three pakshas, i.e. one month and a half, or one paksha deficient by three days, i.e. twelve days. We need not say that the latter explanation is inadmissible it evidently rests on a wrong conclusion drawn from a passage of another Sûtra quoted by him, in which it is stated that the Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>îkara<i>n</i>a should be performed sa<i>n</i>vatsarânte dvâda<i>n</i>âhe vâ.

[^243]: 110:1 4, 1. The Âbhyudayika _S_râddha has to be performed on such p. 111 occasions as the birth of a son, the marriage of a son or a daughter, the performance of ceremonies such as the nâmakarman, _k<i>û</i>d_âkarman, &c. See Yâ<i>û</i><i>û</i>avalkya I, 249.

[^244]: 111:3 A _S_râddha ceremony directed to the mothers here precedes that consecrated to the fathers.

[^245]: 111:6 Professor Stenzler's translation of Yâ<i>g</i><i>g</i>avalkya, loc. cit. (pradakshi<i>g</i>âv<i>g</i>tka = die Ehrfurcht beobachtend), has to be corrected according to this Sûtra.

[^246]: 111:7 See chap. 1, 8.

[^248]: 111:11 Concerning the invitation' (âvâhana) see the note on chap. 2, 5.

[^251]: 111:14 Comp. chap. 2, 5.

[^252]: 112:1 5, 1. As to the Upâkara<i>n</i>a, see the statements of Professor Weber in his second article on the Nakshatras, Abhandlungen der Berliner Akademie, 1861, p. 338, and of Professor Bühler in his notes on Âpastamba, S.B.E., II, pp. 110, 111.

[^253]: 112:2 The Nakshatra _S<i>rava</i>n<i>rava</i>s_ruti, &c.

[^254]: 112:4 I have followed Nârâya<i>n</i>a, but perhaps I ought to have translated, ‘Sûktas or Anuvâkas,’ and in the fifth Sûtra, ‘Adhyâyas or the sections, &c.’

[^255]: 113:9 According to Kaushîtaki, the oblations are made with the first and last _ri_<i>k</i>as of each Ma<i>k</i><i>k</i>ala. The last <i>ri</i>_k_ of the tenth Ma<i>k</i><i>k</i>ala quoted here, ta_k<i>k</i>kh<i>k</i>m<i>k</i>ri_<i>k</i>îmahe, is different from the verse with which our Sa<i>k</i>hitâ (the _S_âkala Sa<i>k</i>hitâ of the Rig-veda) closes. It is well known that ta_k<i>k</i>kh<i>k</i>m<i>k</i>ri_<i>k</i>îmahe is the last verse in the Bâshkala _S<i>k</i>S_âṅkhâyana school (comp. Indische Studien, IV, 431; Weber, Verzeichniss der Berliner Sanskrit-Handschriften, p. 314, &c.; Indische Literaturgeschichte, second edition, Nachtrag, p. 2). It was also known long since that the Bâshkala Sâkhâ of the Rig-veda contains eight hymns more than the _S<i>k</i>S_âkhâ. The _K<i>k</i>n_avyûha Bhâshya (comp. Dr. von Schroeder's Introduction to his excellent edition of the Maitrâya<i>k</i>î Sa<i>k</i>hitâ, vol. i, p. xxiv), known to me through the kindness of Professor Weber, tells which eight hymns these are. There it is said (folio 22 of Professor Weber's MS.) that in the Bâshkala Sa<i>k</i>hitâ there followed after VIII, 48 the first two of the Vâlakhilya hymns, after VIII, 94 the Vâlakhilya hymns 3-7, and at the end of the whole collection the so-called sa<i>k</i><i>k</i><i>k</i>âna hymn (see Professor Max Müller's edition, vol. vi, p. 32), which ends with the very verse quoted in our Sûtra, ta_k<i>k</i>kh<i>k</i>m<i>k</i>ri_<i>k</i>îmahe.

[^256]: 114:16 The six kinds of works are, performing sacrifices (ya<i>g</i>ana), officiating at the sacrifices of others (yâ<i>g</i>ana), studying the Veda (adhyayana), teaching the Veda to others (adhyâpana), giving (dâna), and accepting gifts (pratigraha). Nârâya<i>g</i>a.

[^257]: 114:17 Concerning the Utsarga, see chap. 6. This <i>S</i>loka occurs also Manu IV, 119 with the reading kshepa<i>n</i>am instead of kshapa<i>n</i>am (‘kshapa<i>n</i>a_m<i>n</i>kh<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>h_,’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a). Kshapa<i>n</i>am is correct.

[^258]: 114:1 6, 1. This Kha<i>n</i><i>n</i>a treats of the Utsarga, i.e. the ceremony performed at the end of the term.

[^259]: 115:6\_6 On the tarpa<i>n</i>a, comp. chaps. 9 and 10.

[^260]: 115:2 7, 2. The translation of âkâlam given in my German edition (Während der betreffenden Zeit) is wrong: comp. the commentary there quoted at p. 150; Gautama XVI, 22; Professor Stenzler's note on Pâraskara II, II, 2.

[^261]: 115:7\_6 Agha_m<i> sapi</i>n_<i> sapi</i>asodakayor mara<i> sapi</i>a_m_. Nârâya<i> sapi</i>a.

[^262]: 115:7 According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a the <i>k</i>a at the end of this Sûtra would p. 116 be intended to convey the meaning that on the pratipad days of each fortnight the study should also be interrupted.

[^263]: 116:8 The translation of nabhya is quite conjectural. Nârâya<i>n</i>a gives a different meaning to this word; comp. p. 150 of the German edition.

[^264]: 116:11 Â<i>âryaputrâdaya</i>âryaputrâdaya_h_. Nârâya<i>âryaputrâdaya</i>a.

[^265]: 116:21 The reason why the recitation of the Rig-veda is forbidden when the sound of a Sâman is heard, becomes manifest, for instance, from Âpastamba I, to, 7, where the discontinuance of the Veda-study is prescribed when the barking of dogs, the braying of asses, the cry of a wolf, &c., the sound of musical instruments, of weeping, and of a Sâman is heard. Loud sounds like these would disturb the recitation of _Ri_<i>k</i> or Ya<i>g</i>us texts. A very curious opinion has been recently brought forward by Professor Aufrecht (see his edition of the Rig-veda, second edition, vol. ii, p. xxxviii) that the incompatibility of the recitation of _Ri_<i>k</i> hymns and of Sâmans ‘beruht auf der Kenntniss von der Willkür and der zum Theil unwürdigen Weise, in welcher der alte Text des Rig-veda in diesem Gesangbuche (i.e. the Sâmavedâr<i>g</i>ika) behandelt ist.’

[^266]: 117:23 Grâmâra<i>n</i>ye grâmam (read, grâma?) evâra<i>n</i>ya_m<i>n</i>m_ tatra nâdhîyîta. Nârâya<i>n</i>a.

[^267]: 117:29 Except during the rainy season. Nârâya<i>n</i>a.

[^268]: 117:45 Nârâya<i>n</i>a also understands maithuna, and I think that the German translation ought to be corrected accordingly.

[^269]: 118:53 I think that this Sûtra contains two different rules which have to be separated, viz. 1. vidyutstanayitnuvarshavar<i>g</i>a<i>m</i> kalpe; 2. varshavad ardhashash<i>g</i>eshu. The first of these rules would extend the cases of anadhyâya mentioned in this chapter to the study of the Kalpa-sûtra, except the cases of lightning, rain, &c. The second would refer to the five months and a half following on the Utsarga ceremony (comp. chap. 6, 8), and would imply that during this time the same texts are to be studied or not, according as their study is allowed or forbidden during rainfall: i.e. the study of the Sa<i>g</i>hitâ is to be discontinued, while that of the Kalpa is allowed to go on. Râma<i>g</i>andra and Nârâya<i>g</i>a differ from this interpretation; see p. 151 of the German edition.

[^270]: 118:55 Comp. Manu IV, 117; Vasish<i>th</i>a XIII, 16.

[^271]: 119:1 8, 1. Nyâyena _s<i>ishyadharme</i>n<i>ishyadharme</i>h<i>ishyadharme</i>h<i>ishyadharme</i>s<i>ishyadharme</i>k<i>ishyadharme</i>h_ pravartayet. Nârâya<i>ishyadharme</i>a.

[^272]: 119:11 _K<i>ara</i>n<i>ara</i>m<i>ara</i>th<i>ara</i>m<i>ara</i>ri<i>ara</i>th<i>ara</i>h_. Nârâya<i>ara</i>a.

[^273]: 119:12 The words adhîhi bho (recite, sir!) are pronounced by the student; this follows from the passages quoted in the note on 1I, 5, 10. Nârâya<i>n</i>a states that those words are pronounced by the teacher (â<i>n</i>âryo guru_h<i>n</i>s_ishyam adhyâpanârtham adhîhi bho 3 iti <i>s</i>abdam uktvâ . . .).

[^274]: 120:19 The translation of âtmâna<i>m</i> vipariharet is conjectural; comp. also Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note, p. 151 of the German edition.

[^275]: 120:1 9, 1. It is not expressly stated in our text for what occasion the tarpa<i>n</i>a (i.e. satiating of deities, _Ri_shis, &c. with water-offerings), which is treated of in chap. 9-10, shall be prescribed. The comparison of Baudhâyana II, 9 might perhaps lead us to believe that the ceremony in question is to be performed whenever the sacrificer takes a bath. But the two texts which are most closely connected with ours, the _S<i>n</i>s_valâyana G<i>n</i>hyas, seem to point clearly to another conclusion. The _S<i>n</i>n_a to the place which would correspond to Sûtra II, 7, 28 of our text. The passage of the _S_âmbavya-sûtra runs thus: mûle ku<i>n</i><i>n</i>a_m<i>n</i>ri<i>n</i>h<i>n</i>ñ_<i>n</i>aty athemâs (so the MS.) tarpayati Agni<i>h</i> Pra<i>n</i>âpatir Virûpâksha_h_, &c. It ends: pitara_h<i>n</i>h<i>n</i>h_ Paila<i>h</i> Kaho<i>n</i>a<i>h</i> Kaushîtaka<i>h</i> (sic) Kaho<i>n</i>âya Kaushîtakaye svadhâstv iti pratipurusha_h<i>n</i>rî_<i>n</i>s tarpayitvâ. The last words are taken from the Sûtra IV, 6, 6 of our text. Thus there can be no doubt that _S<i>n</i>n_a for the conclusion of the p. 121 vedâdhyayana. The same can be said of Â<i>n</i>valâyana, who also by the position which he assigns to the tarpa<i>n</i>a sections (III, 4) brings it into a similar connection with the vedâdhyayana (see Nârâya<i>n</i>a's commentary on Â<i>n</i>v., loc. cit.). We may also refer to the treatise about the study of the Âra<i>n</i>yaka, which is appended to the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>n</i>hya as its sixth book; there the tarpa<i>n</i>a is mentioned quite in the same connection (VI, 6, 10 seq.). I believe, therefore, that in our text, chapters 9 and 10 have found their place here as a sort of supplementary addition to chap. 6, 6, just as in the first book the list of Nakshatras seems likewise appended to the Sûtra I, 25, 5.
  According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, snâta<i>h</i> in the first Sûtra would refer to the bath which forms part of the Samâvartana ceremony (see III, 1, 1), so that it would be the G<i>n</i>hastha, who has taken the Samâvartana bath, to whom the following rules refer.

[^276]: 121:3 Comp. the similar lists of Â<i>ri</i>valâyana, G<i>ri</i>hya III, 4; _S_âmbavya, quoted in my German edition of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, p.153; and Baudhâyana II, 9 (S.B.E., vol. xiv, pp. 252 seq.). The last seems to be the most modern.
  It should be observed that the section of the list contained in this Sûtra, as well as that given below, chap. 10, 3, is divided into p. 122 two parts, in the first of which the name of the being to be worshipped is given in the nominative case, with the verb tripyatu, while in the second it stands in the accusative, with the verb tarpayâmi. The first part of this section contains the names of gods and of divine beings, such as the rivers, the mountains, &c.; in the second part are found abstract qualities or notions, such as mati, dhriti, <i>s</i>ruti. Similarly in chapter 10, 3 the Vedic poets, a few ancient teachers, and wise women, such as Gârg or Sulabhâ, form the first part of the list, and then follow, in the accusative case, the names of such doctors as Sàükhâyana, Â<i>s</i>valâyana, Sâkalya. In Â<i>s</i>valâyana's Sûtra of the first of our two sections only the first part reoccurs, the second is omitted, while the second section is found there in its entirety, with the same difference of names given in the nominative and accusative cases. The conjectures, however, which I had once based on this difference (see my German edition, pp. 152, 153) as to the distinction of a more ancient part of the list, and of later supplements, are perhaps too hazardous.

[^279]: 123:10 Nârâya<i>n</i>a states that ‘with his wife’ is to be supplied to this Sûtra, which indeed is rendered probable through the comparison of Gautama IX, 32; Manu IV, 43, &c.

[^286]: 126:16 According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a we should have to supply, ‘while it is raining,’ which is countenanced by a number of parallel texts, for instance, Â<i>n</i>v.-G<i>n</i>hya III, 9, 6.

Nârâya<i>k</i>a(comp. the text of his scholion, p. 155 of the German edition) understands this in a different way; he says that in the water-pot mentioned in the fifth Sûtra two different sthânas are to be distinguished, a higher part of it and a lower (uttarâdharatayâ). Now when the sacrificer, for instance, as prescribed in Sûtra 6, invites the Lord of the celestial Serpents, and the celestial Serpents to wash themselves, the pouring out of water would have to be performed first thrice for the Lord of the celestial Serpents in the higher place, then thrice for the celestial Serpents in the lower place.

Beginning from the _S<i>n</i>n_î full moon till the Pratyavaroha<i>n</i>a, the offerings to the Serpents mentioned above have to be repeated every day (chap. 15, 19); the Pratyavaroha<i>n</i>a is the concluding ceremony of these rites devoted to the Serpents.
