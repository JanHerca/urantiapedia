2\. [^210]. Having established the (sacred) domestic fire outside with (the words), ‘I place (here) Agni with genial mind; may he be the assembler of goods. Do no harm to us, to the old nor to the young; be a saviour to us, to men and animals!’—

2\. ‘May the forest give me in charge to the village. Great one! give me in charge to the all’—thus (he speaks) when entering the village, not without (carrying) something (with himself, such as fuel, flowers, &c.)

2\. [^218]. With (the words), ‘Thou art the world, thousandfold prospering. To Indra may exertion (?) give thee. Inviolate art thou, unhurt, sap, food, protection. For as many (cows) I shall do this now, for more (than these) may I do it in the latest year.’

4\. Here is delight; take delight here. Svâhâ! <span id="p101"><sup><small>[ p. 101 ]</small></sup></span> Here is still-standing; here is (your) own still-standing. Svâhâ!

‘I have let the calf join its mother. May the calf, sucking its mother's breast, support increase of wealth among us. Svâhâ!’

5\. With the verse, ‘May Pûshan go after our cows’ (Rig-veda VI, 54, 5) he sacrifices from (a mess of sacrificial food) belonging to Pûshan.

6\. [^220]. Having murmured the Rudra-(hymns),

7\. (He takes) a one-coloured, two-coloured, or three-coloured (bull),

[^202]: 91:2 1, 2. Comp. above, I, 16, 1, and the note there.

[^203]: 91:4 Nârâya<i>n</i>a says here, ena_m<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>k<i>n</i>m<i>n</i>m_ kârayitvâ. Comp. Pâraskara II, 6, 9 seq.

[^204]: 92:12 Pratilîna evidently means the same thing that is so often expressed in the Buddhist texts by pa<i>t</i>isallîna.

[^205]: 92:18 The pair of garments are those referred to in Sûtra 6; on the turban see Sûtra 8. On staff and shoes comp. Sûtras 10, 11; on the parasol, Sûtra 9.

[^206]: 92:1 2, 1 seqq. On the house of the Vedic Indians, comp. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, pp. 148 seqq.

[^207]: 93:9 On parisrut, see Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 281. The words bhuvanas pari give no sense; Pâraskara probably gives the true reading, â vatso _g<i>agadai</i>h_ saha (III, 4, 4; comp. Sûtra 8: Vasû<i>m</i>_s<i>agadai</i>k_a Rudrân Âdityân Î_s<i>agadai</i>m<i>agadai</i>g<i>agadai</i>h_ saha; _g<i>agadai</i>G_ayarâma's commentary by anuga, anu<i>agadai</i>ara). The word <i>g</i>agada of course was exposed to all sorts of corruptions; p. 94 thus the text of Â_s<i>agadai</i>g<i>agadai</i>m_ saka; the Atharva-veda (III, 12, 7) <i>g</i>agatâ saha; and from this <i>g</i>agat to the bhuvana found in our text the way is not very long.

[^208]: 94:1 3, 1. According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a the verse given in chap. 2, 9 forms one Mantra with those in 3, 1. The meaning of sîlamâvatî is uncertain. The word reoccurs in Rig-veda X, 75, 8. Pâraskara (III, 4, 4) has sûn<i>n</i>tâvatî. On tilvila, comp. Rig-veda V, 62, 7. The following word is quite uncertain both as to its reading and its meaning. Comp. p. 143 seq. of the German edition. On kîlâla, comp. Zimmer, loc. cit. p. 281.

[^209]: 94:7 Comp. Pâraskara III, 4, 18.

[^210]: 95:1 4, 1. The sacrifice to Vâstoshpati is celebrated when the sacrificer enters his new house.

[^211]: 95:2 Comp. above, I, 7, 9.

[^212]: 95:5-7 On the way of reciting a Pragâtha, so as to form three verses, see Indische Studien, VIII, 25; Zeitschrift der deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XXXVIII, 476. The Stotriya of the Rathantara is Rig-veda VII, 32, 22 seq.; that of the Vâmadevya, IV, 31, 1-3; that of the B<i>ri</i>hat, VI, 46, 1 seq.

[^213]: 96:3 5, 3. For anyeshv aha_m<i> we should read perhaps yeshv aha</i>m_. Â_s<i> we should read perhaps yeshv aha</i>S_raut. II, 5, 17 has teshv aha_m_.

[^214]: 97:2 7, 2. On kîlâla, see chap. 3, 1.

[^215]: 97:5 Padyâ virâ<i>g</i> is the Virâ<i>g</i> metre, so far as it consists of p. 98 Pâdas; in this connection, of course, the phrase is intended besides to convey the meaning of ‘the splendour which dwells in the feet.’ Comp. Pâraskara I, 3, 12 and Professor Stenzler's note there. My German translation of this Sûtra of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana rests on a misunderstanding.

[^216]: 98:1 8, 1. The Âgraya<i>n</i>esh<i>n</i>i is the corresponding rite of the <i>S</i>rauta ritual. Comp. Indische Studien, X, 343. The deities of that sacrifice are Indra and Agni; the Vi<i>n</i>ve devâs; Heaven and Earth.

[^217]: 98:3 In the text read for tvayâ <i>g</i>vasena, tvayâऽvasena.

[^218]: 99:1 9, 1. The noisy ones are the winds; comp. the passage of _S<i>âṅkhâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra, quoted p. 144 of the German edition.

[^219]: 100:2 10, 2. The reading of tvâ <i>s</i>ramo dadat is doubtful. See the Various Readings in the German edition.

[^220]: 100:1 11, 1. A part of this chapter is nearly identical with the corresponding section of the Kât<i>h</i>aka-g<i>h</i>hya; see Jolly's article, Das Dharma-sûtra des Vish<i>h</i>u, &c. (Sitzung der philos. philol. Classe der Bairischen Academie, 7 Juni, 1879), p. 39. Comp. also Pâraskara III, 9; Vish<i>h</i>u LXXXVI, and Jolly's remarks, in Deutsche Rundschau X, p. 428.

[^221]: 101:6 Rig-veda I, 43. 114; II, 33; VII, 46.

[^222]: 101:14 The translation ‘do not desert us,’ rests on the conjecture mâvasthâta; see the Various Readings, and the note on p. 245 of the German edition.

[^223]: 102:1 12, 1. On the Ash<i>t</i>akâ festivals, of which some texts reckon three, while others have four, comp. Weber, Naxatra (second article), pp. 337, 341 seq.; Bühler, S.B.E., II, p. 214; Ludwig, Rig-veda, vol. iv, pp. 424 seq.; Atharva-veda III, 10. The last Ash<i>t</i>akâ, which is celebrated in the dark fortnight of Mâgha, is called Ekâsh<i>t</i>akâ; this Ash<i>t</i>akâ is called the ‘wife of the year,’ ‘the image of the year,’ ‘the disposer of the days.’ If the Phâlguna month is reckoned as the first of the year, this Ash<i>t</i>akâ precedes the year's beginning only by a few days; there are also some Vedic passages which point to the Ekâsh<i>t</i>akâ's following shortly after the beginning of the year; see Weber, loc. cit., p. 342.

[^224]: 102:3 Instead of navak<i>ri</i>t the parallel texts (except the Mantrabrâhma<i>ri</i>a II, 2, 12) have navagat, which is explained by nûtanavivâhavatî (Ludwig, loc. cit.); the ‘three powers’ are understood by Mâdhava (in the commentary on Taitt. Sa<i>ri</i>h. IV, 3, 11) as Agni, Sûrya, and <i>K</i>andra.

[^225]: 102:5 After pavamâna<i>h</i> there is evidently a word wanting that p. 103 indicated the limb of the Ash<i>t</i>akâ's body identified with the months and half-months.

[^226]: 103:1 13, 1. On madhyâvarsha, comp. Weber, loc. cit., pp. 331, 337. Nârâya<i>n</i>a understands not ‘in the middle of the rainy season,’ but ‘in the middle of the year’ (see his note, p. 146 of the German edition). I cannot help thinking that the word madhyâvarshe, given by the MSS. here and in Pâraskara III, 3, 13, and explained by Nârâya<i>n</i>a, is a corrupt reading which we should correct into mâghyavarshe (‘the festival celebrated during the rainy season under the Nakshatra Maghâs’), or something like that. The MSS. of Â_s_valâyana-G<i>n</i>hya II, 5, 9 have mâghyâvarsha_m_, mâghâvarsha_m_, mâdhyâvarsha_m_. Vish<i>n</i>u (LXXVI, 1, comp. LXXVIII, 52, and Professor Jolly's note, Sacred Books of the East, VII, p. 240) mentions ‘the three Ash<i>n</i>akâs, the three Anvash<i>n</i>akâs, a Mâgha day which falls on the thirteenth of the dark half of the month Praush<i>n</i>apada.’ Comp. Manu III, 273, varshâsu _k<i>n</i>k_a; Yâ<i>nd</i>avalkya I, 260.

[^227]: 104:5 Instead of ‘N.N.’ (the text has the feminine amushyai) the sacrificer inserts the name of his mother. For mâsâs, ardhamâsâs I propose to read, mâsais, ardhamâsais.

[^228]: 104:7 On Anvash<i>t</i>akya, comp. Bühler, S.B.E., XIV, p. 55; Jolly. loc. cit., p. 59.

[^229]: 105:3-6 14, 3-6. This is one of the passages which the author has taken unchanged from a more ancient Sûtra; see Â_s_v. II, 4, 8-11; Gobhila IV, 1 (end of the chapter). The Sûtras do not refer, as their position would seem to indicate, to the third, but to the second Ash<i>t</i>akâ.
