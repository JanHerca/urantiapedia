3\. In feeding them he should not look at any (worldly) purposes.

4\. [^676] Having put wood on the fire and strewn southward pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, having prepared the Â<i>ya in an Â</i>ya in an Â<i>ya in an Â</i>ya pot over which he has laid one purifier, having sprinkled water round (the fire) from right to left, and put a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire), he sacrifices with the (spoon called) Darvi which is made of Udumbara wood.

5\. Having performed the rites down to the Â<i>g</i>yabhâga offerings, he suspends his sacrificial cord over his right shoulder and calls the Fathers (to his sacrifice) with (the verse), ‘Come hither, O Fathers, friends of Soma, on your hidden, ancient paths, bestowing on us offspring and wealth and long life, a life of a hundred autumns.’ <span id="p226">[<sup><small>p. 226</small></sup>]</span>

6\. [^677] He sprinkles water in the same direction (i.e. towards the south) with (the verse), ‘Divine waters, send us Agni. May our Fathers enjoy this sacrifice. May they who receive their nourishment every month bestow on us wealth with valiant heroes.’

7\. [^678] Having performed the rites down to the Vyâh<i>ri</i>ti oblations with his sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, he suspends it over his right shoulder and sacrifices with (the following Mantras):

‘To Soma with the Fathers, svadhâ! Adoration! 'To Yama with the Aṅgiras and with the Fathers, svadhâ! Adoration!

‘With the waters that spring in the east and those that come from the north: with the waters, the supporters of the whole world, I interpose another one between (myself and) my father. Svadhâ! Adoration!

‘I interpose (another one) through the mountains;

‘I interpose through the wide earth; through the sky and the points of the horizon, through infinite bliss I interpose another one between (myself and) my grandfather. Svadhâ! Adoration!

‘I interpose (another one) through the seasons, through days and nights with the beautiful twilight. Through half-months and months I interpose another one between (myself and) my great-grandfather. Svadhâ! Adoration!’

Then he sacrifices with their names: ‘To N.N. svadhâ! Adoration! To N.N. svadhâ! Adoration!’

<span id="p227">[<sup><small>p. 227</small></sup>]</span>

‘Wherein my mother has done amiss, abandoning her duty (towards her husband), may my father take that sperm as his own; may another one fall off from the mother. Svadhâ! Adoration!’

1\. [^679] 'The Fathers who are here and who are not here, and whom we know and whom we do not know: Agni, to thee they are known, how many they are, <i>G</i>âtavedas. May they enjoy what thou givest them in our oblation. Svadhâ! Adoration!

‘Your limb that this flesh-devouring (Agni) has burnt, leading you to the worlds (of the Fathers), <i>G</i>âtavedas, that I restore to you again. Unviolated with all your limbs arise, O Fathers! Svadhâ! Adoration!

‘Carry the Â<i>g</i>ya, <i>G</i>âtavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting afar. May streams of Â<i>g</i>ya flow to them; may their wishes with all their desires be fulfilled! Svadhâ! Adoration!’

4\. He then touches the food with (the formulas), 'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid. I sacrifice thee into the Brahman's mouth. I sacrifice thee into the up-breathing and down-breathing of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. Thou art imperishable; do not perish for the Fathers yonder, in yon world! The earth is steady; Agni is its surveyor in order that what has been given may not be lost.

‘The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &c. Do not perish for the grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The air is steady; Vâyu is its surveyor, in order that what has been given may not be lost.

‘The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &c. Do not perish for the great-grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The heaven is steady; Âditya is its surveyor, in order that what has been given may not be lost.’

5\. [^680] With (the words), ‘I establish myself in the breath and sacrifice ambrosia,’ he causes the Brâhma<i>n</i>as to touch (the food).



## PA<i>T</i>ALA 4, SECTION 12.

1\. While they are eating, he looks at them with (the words), ‘My soul (âtman) dwells in the Brahman that it may be immortal.’

When they have eaten (and go away), he goes after them and asks for their permission to take the remains of their meal (for the rites which he is going <span id="p229">[<sup><small>p. 229</small></sup>]</span> to perform). Then he takes a water-pot and a handful of Darbha grass, goes forth to a place that lies in a south-easterly intermediate direction, spreads the Darbha grass out with its points towards the south, and pours out on that (grass) with downward-turned hands, ending in the south, three handfuls of water, with (the formulas), ‘May the fathers, the friends of Soma, wipe themselves! May the grandfathers . . . the great-grandfathers, the friends of Soma, wipe themselves!’ or, ‘N.N.! Wash thyself! N.N.! Wash thyself!’

3\. [^681] On that (grass) he puts down, with downward-turned hands, ending in the south, the lumps (of food for the Fathers). To his father he gives his lump with (the words), ‘This to thee, father, N.N.!’ to the grandfather with (the words), ‘This to thee, grandfather, N.N.!’ to the great-grandfather with (the words), ‘This to thee, great-grandfather, N.N.!’ silently a fourth (lump). This (fourth lump) is optional.

4\. Should he not know the names (of the ancestors), he gives the lump to the father with (the words), ‘Svadhâ to the Fathers who dwell on the earth,’ to the grandfather with (the words), ‘Svadhâ to the Fathers who dwell in the air,’ to the great-grandfather with (the words), ‘Svadhâ to the Fathers who dwell in heaven.’

5\. Then he gives, corresponding to each lump, collyrium and (other) salve and (something that represents) a garment. <span id="p230">[<sup><small>p. 230</small></sup>]</span>

6\. [^682] The collyrium (he gives), saying three times, ‘Anoint thy eyes, N.N.! Anoint thy eyes, N.N.!’

7\. The salve, saying three times, ‘Anoint thyself, N.N.! Anoint thyself, N.N.!’

8\. [^683] With (the formula), ‘These garments are for you, O Fathers. Do not seize upon anything else that is ours,’ he tears off a skirt (of his garment) or a flake of wool and puts that down (for the Fathers), if he is in the first half of his life.

9\. He tears out some hairs of his body, if in the second half.

10\. Then he washes the vessel (in which the food was of which he had offered the lumps), and sprinkles (the water with which he has washed it), from right to left round (the lumps) with (the Mantra), ‘These honey-sweet waters, bringing refreshment to children and grandchildren, giving sweet drink and ambrosia to the Fathers, the divine waters refresh both (the living and the dead), these rivers, abounding in water, covered with reeds, with beautiful bathing-places; may they flow up to you in yon world!’ Then he turns the vessel over, crosses his hands so that the left hand becomes right and the right hand becomes left, and worships (the Fathers) with the formulas of adoration, ‘Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of sap’ (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. III, 2, 5, 5).

11\. Then he goes to the brink of some water and pours down three handfuls of water (with the following Mantras):






<span id="p231">[<sup><small>p. 231</small></sup>]</span>

## PA<i>T</i>ALA 4, SECTION 13.

1\. 'This is for thee, father, this honey-sweet wave, rich in water. As great as Agni and the earth are, so great is its measure, so great is its might. As. such a great one I give it. As Agni is imperishable and inexhaustible, thus may it be imperishable and inexhaustible, sweet drink to my father. By that imperishable (wave), that sweet drink, live thou together with those, N.N.! The <i>Rik<i>as are thy might.

‘This is for thee, grandfather, &c. . . . As great as Vâyu and the air are . . . As Vâyu is imperishable . . . to my grandfather. . . . The Ya<i>g</i>us are thy might.

‘This is for thee, great-grandfather, &c. . . . As great as Âditya and the heaven are . . . "The Sâmans are thy might.’

2\. Returning (from the place where he has performed the Pi<i>nd</i>a offerings) he puts the substance cleaving (to the Sthâlî) into the water-pot and pours it out, with (the verse), ‘Go away, O Fathers, friends of Soma, on your hidden, ancient paths. After a month return again to our house and eat our offerings, rich in offspring, in valiant sons.’

3\. [^684] Thereby the (<i>S</i>râddha) celebrated in the middle of the rainy season has been declared.

4\. There (oblations of) flesh are prescribed;

5\. Of vegetables, if there is no flesh.
