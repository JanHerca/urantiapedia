## ADHYÂYA I, KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 1.

1\. [^358]. The (rites) based on the spreading (of the three sacred fires) have been declared; we shall declare the G<i>ri</i>hya (rites).

2\. [^359]. There are three (kinds of) Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as, the hutas, (i.e. the sacrifices) offered over the fire; over something that is not the fire, the prahutas; and at the feeding of Brâhma<i>g</i>as, those offered in the Brahman.

3\. [^360]. And they quote also <i>Rik<i>as, ‘He who with a piece of wood or with an oblation, or with knowledge (“veda”).’ <span id="p160">[<sup><small>p. 160</small></sup>]</span>

4 [^361]. Even he who only puts a piece of wood (on the fire) full of belief, should think, ‘Here I offer a sacrifice; adoration to that (deity)!’

(The <i>Rik<i> quoted above then says), ‘He who with an oblation’—and, ‘He who with knowledge;’ even by learning only satisfaction is produced (in the gods).

Seeing this the <i>Ri</i>shi has said, ‘To him who does not keep away from himself the cows, to him who longs for cows, who dwells in the sky, speak a wonderful word, sweeter than ghee and honey.’ Thereby he means, ‘This my word, sweeter than ghee and honey, is satisfaction (to the god); may it be sweeter.’

(And another <i>Ri</i>shi says), ‘To thee, O Agni, by this <i>Rik<i> we offer an oblation prepared by our heart; may these be oxen, bulls, and cows.’ (Thereby he means), ‘They are my oxen, bulls, and cows (which I offer to the god), they who study this text, reciting it for themselves (as their Svâdhyâya).’

(And further on the <i>Rik<i> quoted above says), ‘He who (worships Agni) with adoration, offering rich sacrifices.’ ‘Verily also by the performing of adoration (the gods may be worshipped); for the gods are not beyond the performing of adoration; adoration verily is sacrifice’—thus runs a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.







<span id="p161">[<sup><small>p. 161</small></sup>]</span>

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ. 2.

1\. [^362]. Now he should make oblations in the evening and in the morning of prepared sacrificial food,

2\. [^363]. To the deities of the Agnihotra, to Soma Vanaspati, to Agni and Soma, to Indra and Agni, to Heaven and Earth, to Dhanvantari, to Indra, to the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs, to Brahman.

3\. [^364]. He says Svâhâ, and then he offers the Balis—

4\. To those same deities, to the waters, to the herbs and trees, to the house, to the domestic deities, to the deities of the ground (on which the house stands),

5\. [^365]. To Indra and Indra's men, to Yama and Yama's men, to Varu<i>n</i>a and Varu<i>n</i>a's</span>

7Soma and Soma's men—these (oblations he makes) to the different quarters (of the horizon, of which those are the presiding deities).

6\. To Brahman and Brahman's men in the middle, <span id="p162">[<sup><small>p. 162</small></sup>]</span>

7\. To the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs, to all day-walking beings—thus by day;

8\. To the night-walking (beings)—thus at night.

9\. To the Rakshas—thus to the north.

10\. Svadhâ to the fathers (i.e. Manes)'—with these words he should pour out the remnants to the south, with the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder.





## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 3.

1\. [^366]. Now wherever he intends to perform a sacrifice, let him besmear (with cowdung) a surface of the dimension at least of an arrow on each side; let him draw six lines thereon, one turned to the north, to the west (of the spot on which the fire is to be placed); two (lines) turned to the east, at the two different ends (of the line mentioned first); three (lines) in the middle (of those two); let him sprinkle that (place with water), establish the (sacred) fire (thereon), put (two or three pieces of fuel) on it, wipe (the ground) round (the fire), strew (grass) round (it), to the east, to the south, to the west, to the north, ending (each time) in the north. Then (follows) silently the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire).

2\. With two (Ku<i>s</i>a blades used as) strainers the purifying of the Â<i>s</i>ya (is done).

3\. [^367]. Having taken two Ku<i>s</i>a blades with unbroken tops, which do not bear a young shoot in them, of the measure of a span, at their two ends with his <span id="p163">[<sup><small>p. 163</small></sup>]</span> thumbs and fourth fingers, with his hands turned with the inside upwards, he purifies (the Â<i>s</i>ya, from the west) to the east, with (the words), ‘By the impulse of Savit<i>ri</i> I purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the rays of the good sun’—once with this formula, twice silently.

4\. [^368]. The strewing (of grass) round (the fire) may be done or not done in the Â<i>g</i>ya offerings.

5\. [^369]. So also the two Â<i>g</i>ya portions (may optionally be sacrificed) in the Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as.

6\. [^370]. And the (assistance of a) Brahman (is optional), except at the sacrifice to Dhanvantari and at the sacrifice of the spit-ox (offered to Rudra).

7\. [^371]. Let him sacrifice with (the words), ‘To such and such a deity svâhâ!’

8\. If there is no rule (as to the deities to whom the sacrifice belongs, they are) Agni, Indra, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the Vi<i>g</i>ve devâs, Brahman.

9\. [^372]. (Different Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as, when) offered at the same time, should have the same Barhis (sacrificial grass), the same fuel, the same Â<i>g</i>ya, and the same (oblation to Agni) Svish<i>g</i>ak<i>g</i>t.

10\. With reference thereto the following sacrificial stanza is sung:

‘He who has to perform (different) Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as, should offer them with the same Â<i>g</i>ya, the same <span id="p164">[<sup><small>p. 164</small></sup>]</span> Barhis, and the same Svish<i>g</i>ak<i>g</i>t, even if the deity (of those sacrifices) is not the same.’





## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 4.

1\. [^373]. During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon, under an auspicious Nakshatra the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin), the cutting of the beard, and marriage (should be celebrated).

2\. According to some (teachers), marriage (may be celebrated) at any time.

3\. Before those (ceremonies) let him sacrifice four Â<i>g</i>ya oblations—

4\. With the three (verses), ‘Agni, thou purifiest life’ (Rig-veda I X, 66, 10 seq.), and with (the one verse), ‘Pra<i>g</i>âpati, no other one than thou’ (Rig-Veda X, 121, 10).

5\. [^374]. Or with the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis.

6\. [^375]. According to some (teachers), the one and the other.

7\. [^376]. No such(oblations), according to some (teachers).

8\. At the marriage the fourth oblation with the verse, ‘Thou (O Agni) art Aryaman towards the girls’ (Rig-veda V, 3, 2).





## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 5.

1\. [^377]. Let him first examine the family (of the intended bride or bridegroom), as it has been said above, <span id="p165">[<sup><small>p. 165</small></sup>]</span> 'Those who on the mother's and on the father's side.’

2\. Let him give the girl to a (young man) endowed with intelligence.

3\. Let him marry a girl that shows the characteristics of intelligence, beauty, and moral conduct, and who is free from disease.

4\. [^378]. As the characteristics (mentioned in the preceding Sûtra) are difficult to discern, let him make eight lumps (of earth), recite over the lumps the following formula, ‘Right has been born first, in the beginning; on the right truth is founded. For what (destiny) this girl is born, that may she attain here. What is true may that be seen,’ and let him say to the girl, ‘Take one of these.’

5\. [^379]. If she chooses the (lump of earth taken) from a field that yields two crops (in one year), he may know, ‘Her offspring will be rich in food.’ If from a cow-stable, rich in cattle. If from the earth of a Vedi (altar), rich in holy lustre. If from a pool which does not dry up, rich in everything. If from a gambling-place, addicted to gambling. If from a place where four roads meet, wandering to different directions. If from a barren spot, poor. If from a burial-ground, (she will) bring death to her husband.







<span id="p166">[<sup><small>p. 166</small></sup>]</span>

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 6.

1\. [^380]. (The father) may give away the girl, having decked her with ornaments, pouring out a libation of water: this is the wedding (called) Brâhma. A son born by her (after a wedding of this kind) brings purification to twelve descendants and to twelve ancestors on both (the husband's and the wife's) sides.

2\. [^381]. He may give her, having decked her with ornaments, to an officiating priest, whilst a sacrifice with the three (<i>S</i>rauta) fires is going on: this (is the wedding called) Daiva. (A son) brings purification to ten descendants and to ten ancestors on both sides.

3\. [^382]. They fulfil the law together: this (is the wedding called) Prâ<i>g</i>âpatya. (A son) brings purification to eight descendants and to eight ancestors on both sides.

4\. [^383]. He may marry her after having given a bull and a cow (to the girl's father): this (is the wedding called) Ârsha. (A son) brings purification to seven descendants and to seven ancestors on both sides.

5\. [^384]. He may marry her, after a mutual agreement has been made (between the lover and the damsel): this (is the wedding called) Gândharva.

6\. [^385]. He may marry her after gladdening (her father) by money: this (is the wedding called) Âsura. <span id="p167">[<sup><small>p. 167</small></sup>]</span>

7 [^386]. He may carry her off while (her relatives) sleep or pay no attention: this (is the wedding called) Pai<i>s</i>â<i>s</i>a.

8\. [^387]. He may carry her off, killing (her relatives) and cleaving (their) heads, while she weeps and they weep: this (is the wedding called) Râkshasa.





## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 7.

1\. Now various indeed are the customs of the (different) countries and the customs of the (different) villages: those one should observe at the wedding.

2\. What, however, is commonly accepted, that we shall state.

3\. [^388]. Having placed to the west of the fire a mill-stone, to the north-east (of the fire) a water-pot, he should sacrifice, while she takes hold of him. Standing, with his face turned to the west, while she is sitting and turns her face to the east, he should with (the formula), 'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness seize her thumb if he desires that only male children may be born to him;

4\. Her other fingers, (if he is) desirous of female (children);

5\. The hand on the hair-side together with the <span id="p168">[<sup><small>p. 168</small></sup>]</span> thumb, (if) desirous of both (male and female children).

6\. [^389]. Leading her three times round the fire and the water-pot, so that their right sides are turned towards (the fire, &c.), he murmurs, ‘This am I, that art thou; that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Sâman I, the <i>Rik<i> thou. Come! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Loving, bright, with genial mind may we live a hundred autumns.’

7\. [^390]. Each time after he has lead her (so) round, he makes her tread on the stone with (the words), ‘Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Overcome the enemies; tread the foes down.’

8\. [^391]. Having ‘spread under’ (i.e. having first poured Â<i>g</i>ya over her hands), her brother or a person acting in her brother's place pours fried grain twice over the wife's joined hands.

9\. [^392]. Three times for descendants of <i>G</i>amadagni.

10\. He pours again (Â<i>g</i>ya) over (what has been left of) the sacrificial food,

11\. And over what has been cut off.

12\. This is the rule about the portions to be cut off.

13\. [^393]. 'To god Aryaman the girls have made sacrifice, <span id="p169">[<sup><small>p. 169</small></sup>]</span> to Agni; may he, god Aryaman, loosen her from this, and not from that place, Svâhâ!

‘To god Varu<i>n</i>a the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god Varu<i>n</i>a, &c.

‘To god Pûshan the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god Pûshan, &c.’—with (these verses recited by the bridegroom) she should sacrifice (the fried grain) without opening her joined hands, as if (she did so) with the (spoon called) Sru_k_.

14\. [^394]. Without that leading round (the fire, she sacrifices grain) with the neb of a basket towards herself silently a fourth time.

15\. Some lead the bride round each time after the fried grain has been poured out: thus the two last oblations do not follow immediately on each other.

16\. He then loosens her two locks of hair, if they are made, (i.e. if) two tufts of wool are bound round her hair on the two sides,

17\. With (the <i>Rik<i>),‘I release thee from the band of Varu<i>n</i>a’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 24).

18\. The left one with the following (<i>Rik<i>).

19\. [^395]. He then causes her to step forward in a northeastern direction seven steps with (the words), ‘For sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for thriving of wealth with three steps, for comfort with four steps, for offspring with five steps, for the seasons <span id="p170">[<sup><small>p. 170</small></sup>]</span> with six steps. Be friend with seven steps. So be thou devoted to me. Let us acquire many sons who may reach old age!’

20\. [^396]. Joining together their two heads, (the bridegroom? the Â<i>k</i>ârya?) sprinkles them (with water) from the water-pot.

21\. And she should dwell that night in the house of an old Brâhma<i>n</i>a woman whose husband is alive and whose children are alive.

22\. [^397]. When she sees the polar-star, the star Arundhatî, and the seven <i>Ri</i>shis (ursa major), let her break the silence (and say), ‘May my husband live and I get offspring.’





## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 8.

1\. [^398]. If (the newly-married couple) have to make a journey (to their new home), let him cause her to mount the chariot with the (verse), ‘May Pûshan lead thee from here holding thy hand’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 26).

2\. [^399]. With the hemistich, ‘Carrying stones (the river) streams; hold fast each other’ (Rig-veda X, 53, 8) let him cause her to ascend a ship.

3\. With the following (hemistich) let him make her descend (from it).

4\. [^400]. (He pronounces the verse), ‘The living one they bewail’ (Rig-veda X, 40, 10), if she weeps.

5\. They constantly carry the nuptial fire in front. <span id="p171">[<sup><small>p. 171</small></sup>]</span>

6 [^401]. At lovely places, trees, and cross-ways let him murmur (the verse), ‘May no waylayers meet us’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 32).

7\. At every dwelling-place (on their way) let him look at the lookers on, with (the verse), ‘Good luck brings this woman’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 33).

8\. [^402]. With (the verse), ‘Here may delight fulfil itself to thee through offspring’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 27) he should make her enter the house.

9\. [^403]. Having given its place to the nuptial fire, and having spread to the west of it a bull's hide with the neck to the east, with the hair outside, he makes oblations, while she is sitting on that (hide) and takes hold of him, with the four (verses), ‘May Pra<i>g</i>âpati create offspring to us’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 43 seq.), verse by verse, and with (the verse), ‘May all the gods unite’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 47), he partakes of curds and gives (thereof) to her, or he besmears their two hearts with the rest of the Â<i>g</i>ya (of which he has sacrificed).

10\. From that time they should eat no saline food, they should be chaste, wear ornaments, sleep on the ground three nights or twelve nights;

11\. Or one year, (according to) some (teachers); thus, they say, a <i>Ri</i>shi will be born (as their son).

12\. [^404]. When he has fulfilled (this) observance (and has had intercourse with his wife), he should give the bride's shift to (the Brâhma<i>n</i>a) who knows the Sûryâ hymn (Rig-veda X, 85);

13\. 'Food to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as; <span id="p172">[<sup><small>p. 172</small></sup>]</span>

14\. Then he should cause them to pronounce auspicious words.





## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 9.

1\. [^405]. Beginning from the seizing of (the bride's) hand (i.e. from the wedding), he should worship the domestic (fire) himself, or his wife, or also his son, or his daughter, or a pupil.

2\. (The fire) should be kept constantly.

3\. When it goes out, however, the wife should fast: thus (say) some (teachers).

4\. [^406]. The time for setting it in a blaze and for sacrificing in it has been explained by (the rules given with regard to) the Agnihotra,

5\. [^407]. And the sacrificial food, except meat.

6\. But if he likes he may (perform the sacrifice) with rice, barley, or sesamum.

7\. He should sacrifice in the evening with (the formula), ‘To Agni svâhâ!’ in the morning with (the formula), ‘To Sûrya svâhâ!’ Silently the second (oblations) both times.





## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 10.

1\. Now the oblations of cooked food on the (two) Parvan (i.e. the new and full moon) days.</span>

3

2\. The fasting (which takes place) thereat has been declared by (the corresponding rules regarding) the Dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifices. <span id="p173">[<sup><small>p. 173</small></sup>]</span>

3 [^408]. And (so has been declared) the binding together of the fuel and of the Barhis,

4\. [^409]. And the deities (to whom those oblations belong), with the exception of the Upâ<i>m</i><i>m</i>uyâ<i>m</i>a (offerings at which the formulas are repeated with low voice), and of Indra and Mahendra.

5\. Other deities (may be worshipped) according to the wishes (which the sacrificer connects with his offerings).

6\. For each single deity he pours out four handsful (of rice, barley, &c.), placing two purifiers (i.e. Ku<i>s</i>a blades, on the vessel), with (the formula), ‘Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I pour thee out.’

7\. He then sprinkles them (those four portions of Havis with water) in the same way as he had poured them out, with (the formula), ‘Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I sprinkle thee.’

8\. When (the rice or barley grains) have been husked and cleansed from the husks three times, let him cook (the four portions) separately,

9\. Or throwing (them) together.

10\. If he cooks them separately, let him touch the grains, after he has separated them, (and say,) ‘This to this god; this to this god.’

11\. But if he (cooks the portions) throwing (them) together, he should (touch and) sacrifice them, after he has put (the single portions) into different vessels.

12\. [^410]. The portions of sacrificial food, when they <span id="p174">[<sup><small>p. 174</small></sup>]</span> have been cooked, he sprinkles (with Â<i>g</i>ya, takes them from the fire towards the north, places them on the Barhis, and sprinkles the fuel with Â<i>g</i>ya with the formula, ‘This fuel is thy self, <i>G</i>âtavedas; thereby burn thou and increase, and, O burning One, make us increase and through offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and nourishment make us prosper. Svâhâ!’

13\. [^411]. Having silently poured out the two Âghâras (or Â<i>g</i>ya oblations poured out with the Sruva, the one from north-west to south-east, the other from south-west to north-east), he should sacrifice the two Â<i>g</i>ya portions with (the formulas), ‘To Agni svâhâ! To Soma svâhâ!’—

14\. [^412]. The northern one belonging to Agni, the southern one to Soma.

15\. [^413]. It is understood (in the <i>S</i>ruti), The two eyes indeed of the sacrifice are the Â<i>g</i>ya portions,

16\. [^414]. ‘Therefore of a man who is sitting with his face to the west the southern (i.e. right) eye is northern, the northern (i.e. left) eye is southern.’

17\. [^415]. In the middle (of the two Â<i>g</i>ya portions he <span id="p175">[<sup><small>p. 175</small></sup>]</span> sacrifices the other) Havis, or more to the west, finishing (the oblations) in the east or in the north.

18\. To the north-east the oblation to (Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t.

19\. [^416]. He cuts off (the Avadâna portions) from the Havis from the middle and from the eastern part;

20\. From the middle, the eastern part and the western part (the portions have to be cut off) by those who make five Avadânas;

21\. From the northern side the portion for Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t.

22\. [^417]. Here he omits the second pouring (of Â<i>g</i>ya) over (what is left of) the sacrificial food.

23\. [^418]. ‘What I have done too much in this ceremony, or what I have done here too little,</span>

2 may Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, he who knows it, make well sacrificed and well offered for me. To Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, to him who offers the oblations for general expiation, so that they are well offered, to him who makes us succeed in what we desire! Make us in all that we desire successful! Svâhâ!’

24\. [^419]. He pours out the full vessel on the Barhis.

25\. [^420]. This is the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha. <span id="p176">[<sup><small>p. 176</small></sup>]</span>

26\. This is the standard form of the Pâkaya<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>as.

27\. What has been left of the Havis is the fee for the sacrifice.






## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 11.

1\. Now (follows) the ritual of the animal sacrifice.

2\. [^421]. Having prepared to the north of the fire the place for the <i>S</i>âmitra fire, having given drink (to the animal which he is going to sacrifice), having washed the animal, having placed it to the east (of the fire) with its face to the west, having made oblations with the two <i>Rik<i>as, ‘Agni as our messenger’ (Rig-veda I, 12, 1 seq.), let him touch (the animal) from behind with a fresh branch on which there are leaves, with (the formula), ‘Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I touch thee.’

3\. He sprinkles it from before with water in which rice and barley are, with (the formula), ‘Agreeabl</span>

7 and such (a deity) I sprinkle thee.’

4\. Having given (to the animal) to drink of that (water), he should pour out the rest (of it) along its right fore-foot.

5\. Having carried fire round (it), performing that act only (without repeating a corresponding Mantra), they lead it to the north.

6\. [^422]. In front of it they carry a fire-brand. <span id="p177">[<sup><small>p. 177</small></sup>]</span>

7 [^423] This is the <i>S</i>âmitra (fire).

8\. [^424]. With the two Vapâ<i>s</i>rapa<i>s</i>î ladles the ‘performer’ touches the animal.

9\. The sacrificer (touches) the performer.

10\. [^425]. To the west of the _S<i>âmitra (fire) he (the </i>S<i>âmitra (fire) he (the </i>ri_) kills (the animal), the head of which is turned to the east or to the west, the feet to the north; and having placed a grass-blade on his side of the (animal's) navel, (the ‘performer’) draws out the omentum, cuts off the omentum, seizes it with the two Agni<i>âmitra (fire) he (the </i>rapa<i>âmitra (fire) he (the </i>îs, sprinkles it with water, warms it at the <i>S</i>âmitra (fire), takes it before that fire, roasts it, being seated to the south, goes round (the two fires), and sacrifices it.

11\. [^426]. At the same fire they cook a mess of food.

12\. [^427]. Having cut off the eleven Avadânas (or portions which have to be cut off) from the animal, from all its limbs, having boiled them at the <i>S</i>âmitra (fire), <span id="p178">[<sup><small>p. 178</small></sup>]</span> and having warmed the heart on a spit, let him sacrifice first from the mess of cooked food (mentioned in Sûtra 11);

13\. Or together with the Avadâna portions.

14\. [^428]. From each of the (eleven) Avadânas he cuts off two portions.

15\. [^429]. They perform the rites only (without corresponding Mantras) with the heart's spit (i.e. the spit on which the heart had been; see Sûtra 12).

</span>

3



## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 12.

1\. [^430]. At a <i>K</i>aitya sacrifice he should before the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t (offering) offer a Bali to the <i>K</i>aitya.</span>

3

2\. [^431]. If, however, (the <i>K</i>aitya) is distant, (he should send his Bali) through a leaf-messenger. <span id="p179">[<sup><small>p. 179</small></sup>]</span>

3

3 [^432]. With the _Ri__k_, ‘Where thou knowest, O tree’ (Rig-veda V, 5, 10), let him make two lumps (of food), put them on a carrying-pole, hand them over to the messenger, and say to him, ‘Carry this Bali to that (<i>K</i>aitya).’

4\. (He gives him the lump) which is destined for the messenger, with (the words), ‘This to thee.’

5\. If there is anything dangerous between (them and the <i>K</i>aitya), (he gives him) some weapon also.

‘What thy consuming power is, Agni, may I thereby obtain consuming power’—with (these formulas) he should approach the fire, bend his knee, embrace (the teacher's feet), and say to him, ‘Recite, sir! The Sâvitrî, sir, recite!’

5\. Seizing with his (i.e. the student's) garment and with (his own) hands (the student's) hands (the teacher) recites the Sâvitrî, (firstly) Pâda by Pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) the whole (verse).

12\. [^459]. After sunset (the student) should cook the Brâhmaudana (or boiled rice with which the Brâhma<i>n</i>as are to be fed) for the Anuprava<i>n</i>anîya sacrifice (the sacrifice to be performed after a part of the Veda has been studied), and should announce to the teacher (that it is ready). <span id="p192">[<sup><small>p. 192</small></sup>]</span>

13\. The teacher should sacrifice, while the student takes hold of him, with the verse, ‘The wonderful lord of the abode’ (Rig-Veda I, 18, 6).

15\. [^460]. And whatever else has been studied afterwards.

16\. A third time to the <i>Ri</i>shis.

17\. A fourth time (the oblation) to (Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t.

18\. [^461]. Having given food to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as he should cause them to pronounce the end of the Veda (study).

19\. From that time (the student) should eat no saline food; he should observe chastity, and should sleep on the ground through three nights, or twelve nights, or one year.

20\. [^462]. When he has fulfilled those observances, (the teacher) performs (for him) the ‘production of intelligence,’ (in the following way):

21\. [^463]. While (the student) towards an unobjectionable direction (of the horizon) sprinkles thrice (water) from the left to the right with a water-pot round a <span id="p193">[<sup><small>p. 193</small></sup>]</span> Palâ<i>s</i>a (tree) with one root, or round a Ku<i>s</i>a bunch, if there is no Palâ<i>s</i>a, (the teacher) causes him to say, ‘O glorious one, thou art glorious. As thou, O glorious one, art glorious, thus, O glorious one, lead me to glory. As thou art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of the Veda for men.’

22\. [^464]. Thereby, beginning with his having the hair cut, and ending with the giving in charge, the imposing of observances has been declared.

23\. Thus for one who has not been initiated before.

24\. Now as regards one who has been initiated before:

25\. [^465]. The cutting of the hair is optional,

26\. [^466]. And the ‘production of intelligence.’

27\. [^467]. On the giving in charge there are no express rules (in this case);

28\. [^468]. And on the time.

29\. [^469]. (He should recite to him) as the Sâvitrî (the <i>Rik<i>),‘That we choose of god Savit<i>ri</i>’ (Rig-veda V, 82, 1).

6\. [^473]. This has been said in the two <i>Rik<i>as, ‘He whom the officiating priests, performing (the sacrifice) in many ways’ (Rig-veda VIII, 58, I. 2).

7\. [^474]. He chooses the Hot<i>ri</i> first.

17\. ‘<i>K</i>andramas (the moon) is thy Brahman; he is thy Brahman (&c.)’—thus the Brahman.

18\. In the same way the others according to the prescriptions (given above).

20\. [^478]. The functions of an officiating priest are not to be exercised, if abandoned (by another priest), or at an Ahîna sacrifice with small sacrificial fee, or for a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, or decried among the people in his village, or of despised extraction: for such persons (the functions of a Ritvi<i>g</i> should not be exercised).

21\. [^479]. He (who is chosen as a _Ri<i>tvi</i>g_) should ask the Somapravâka, ‘What sacrifice is it? Who are <span id="p197">[<sup><small>p. 197</small></sup>]</span> the priests officiating? What is the fee for the sacrifice?’

22\. If (all the conditions) are favourable, he should accept.

23\. Let (the officiating priests) eat no flesh nor have intercourse with a wife until the completion of the sacrifice.

24\. ‘By this prayer, O Agni, increase’ (Rig-veda I, 31, 18)—with (this verse) let him offer (at the end of the sacrifice) an oblation of Â<i>n</i>ya in (his own) Dakshi<i>n</i>âgni, and go away where he likes;

25\. In the same way one who has not set up the (<i>S</i>rauta) fires, in his (sacred) domestic fire with this _Ri__k_, ‘Forgive us, O Agni, this sin’ (Rig-veda I, 31, 16).





## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 24.

15\. He accepts it with his joined hands with (the formula), ‘By the impulse of the god Sâvitrî, with the arms of the two A<i>s</i>vins, with the hands of Pûshan I accept thee.’ He then takes it into his left hand, looks at it with the three verses, ‘Honey the winds to the righteous one’ (Rig-veda I, 90, 6 seqq.), stirs it about three times from left to right with the fourth finger and the thumb, and wipes (his fingers) with (the formula), ‘May the Vasus eat thee with the Gâyatrî metre’—to the east;

## Footnotes

[^359]: 159:1 1, 1. The spreading (vitâna or, as it is also called, vihâra or vistâra) of the sacred fires is the taking of two of the three sacrificial fires, the Âhavanîya fire and the Dakshi<i>n</i>âgni, out of the Gârhapatya fire (see, for instance, Weber's Indische Studien, IX, 216 seq.). The rites based on, or connected with the vitâna; are the rites forming the subject of the <i>S</i>rauta ritual, which are to be performed with the three fires.

[^360]: 159:2 Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 5, 1; I, 10, 7. The division here is somewhat different from that given by <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana; what <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana calls ahuta, is here prahuta (‘sacrificed up’); the prahutas of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana form here no special category; the prâ<i>ri</i>itas of _S<i>ri</i>n<i>ri</i>s_valâyana. Thus Â<i>ri</i>valâyana has three categories, while <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana (and quite in the same way Pâraskara I, 4, 1) gives four. Nârâya<i>ri</i>a mentions as an example of prahuta sacrifices the balihara<i>ri</i>a prescribed below, I, 2, 3.

[^361]: 159:3 Rig-veda VIII, 19, 5, The mortal who with a piece of wood, or with an oblation, or with knowledge worships Agni, who with adoration (worships him) offering rich sacrifices,' &c.

[^362]: 160:4 The words of the _Ri__k_, ‘with an oblation,’ are here repeated, the Vedic instrumental âhutî being replaced and explained by the regular form âhutyâ.
  The following <i>Rik<i> is taken from the eighth Ma<i>nd</i>ala, 24, 20. The god compared there with a rutting bull is Indra.
  The following verse is Rig-veda VI, 16, 47; we may doubt as to the correctness of the explanation given in our text, by which te te is referred to the persons studying the hymns of the <i>Ri</i>shi. All these quotations of course are meant to show that the knowledge of the Veda and the performing of namas (adoration) is equivalent to a real sacrifice.

[^363]: 161:1 2, 1. This is the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva sacrifice; comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>s</i>hya II, 14, &C.

[^364]: 161:2 The deities of the Agnihotra are Sûrya, Agni, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati. On Soma Vanaspati see the quotations given in Böhtlingk-Roth's Dictionary s. v. vanaspati, 2.

[^365]: 161:3 I think the division of the Sûtras should be altered, so that svâheti would belong to Sûtra 2, and the third Sûtra would consist only of the words atha balihara<i>n</i>am. In this case we should have to translate,
  (1) Now he should make oblations, &c.
  (2) With the words, ‘To the deities of the Agnihotra (i.e. to Agni, to Sûrya, to Pra<i>g</i>âpati), to Soma Vanaspati, &c., svâhâ!’
  (3) Then (follows) the offering of the Balis.
  Comp. Sâṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 14, 4. 5, which passage seems to confirm the view expressed here.

[^366]: 161:5 Manu III, 87.

[^367]: 162:1 3, 1. Comp. Sâṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 7, 6 seq., where the statements regarding the lines to be drawn are somewhat different, and the note there.

[^368]: 162:3 Comp. the description of this act of purifying the Â<i>ri</i>ya, which is in some points more detailed, in <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 8, 14-21.

[^369]: 163:4 Comp. Sâṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 8, 12.

[^370]: 163:5 On the two Â<i>ri</i>yabhâgas offered to Agni and Soma comp. below, chap. 50, 13; <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 9, 5 seq.

[^371]: 163:6 Comp. on these exceptions the Sûtras below, I, 12, 7; IV, 8, 15.

[^372]: 163:7 Comp. Sâṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 9, 18.

[^373]: 163:9 On the oblation to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, see Indische Studien, IX, 257.

[^374]: 164:4\_1 4, 1. Sâṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 5, 2-5.

[^375]: 164:5 With the words, bhû_h_, bhuva_h_, sva_h_, and with the three words together.

[^376]: 164:6 Thus eight oblations are offered, four with the four <i>Rik<i>as quoted in the fourth Sûtra, and four with the Vyâh<i>k</i>tis.

[^377]: 164:7 Neither the oblations with the <i>Rik<i>as nor those with the Vyâh<i>k</i>tis.

[^378]: 164:5\_1 5, 1. <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra IX, 3, 20, 'Who on their mother's as well as p. 165 on their father's side through ten generations are endowed with knowledge, austerity, and meritorious works,' &c.

[^379]: 165:4 I prefer the reading of the Bibliotheca Indica edition, countenanced by Nârâya<i>n</i>a's commentary, durvi<i>nd</i>eyâni laksha<i>n</i>ânîti, &c. The lumps are to be taken from the eight places mentioned in Sûtra 5.

[^380]: 165:5 No doubt the correct reading is not that given by Nârâya<i>n</i>a and accepted by Professor Stenzler, dvipravrâ<i>n</i>inî, but vipravrâ<i>n</i>inî, as four of Professor Stenzler's MSS. read (see his Variae Lectiones, p. 48, and the Petersburg Dictionary s. v. vipravrâ<i>n</i>in).

[^381]: 166:1 6, 1. Comp. Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 30; Âpastamba II, 11, 17; Baudhâyana I, 20, 2.

[^382]: 166:2 Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 31; Âpastamba II, 11, 19; Baudhâyana I, 20, 5.

[^383]: 166:3 Baudhâyana I, 20, 3.

[^384]: 166:4 Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 32; Âpastamba II, 11, 18; Baudhâyana I, 20, 4.

[^385]: 166:5 Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 33; Âpastamba II, II, 20; Baudhâyana I, 20, 6.

[^386]: 166:6 Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 35 (where this rite is designated as Mânusha); Âpastamba II, 12, 1; Baudhâyana I, 20, 7.

[^387]: 167:7 Baudhâyana I, 20, 9.

[^388]: 167:8 Vasish<i>th</i>a I, 34 (where this rite is called Kshâtra); Âpastamba II, a 1, 2; Baudhâyana I, 20, 8. The text of this Sûtra seems to be based on a hemistich hatvâ bhittvâ _k<i>th</i>s<i>th</i>n<i>th</i>m_ haret; comp. Manu III, 33.

[^389]: 167:3 7, 3. Professor Stenzler is evidently right in taking a<i>s</i>mânam as in apposition to d<i>s</i>shadam. Nârâya<i>s</i>a says, d<i>s</i>shat prasiddhâ a<i>s</i>mâ tatputraka_h_. tatrobhayo_h<i>s</i>th<i>s</i>m_ siddham.
  The sacrifice is that prescribed in Sâṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 12, II. 12. Regarding the rite that follows, comp. Sâṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 13, 2.

[^390]: 168:6 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 13, 4. 9. 13.

[^391]: 168:7 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 13, 12.

[^392]: 168:8 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 13, 15. 16.

[^393]: 168:9 The two portions of fried grain poured over the bride's hands, together with the first (upastara<i>n</i>a) and the second (pratyabhighâra<i>n</i>a) pouring out of Â<i>n</i>ya, constitute the four Avattas, or portions cut off from the Havis. The descendants of _G<i>n</i>ñ_<i>n</i>âvattinas, i.e. they used to cut off five such portions (see Kâtyâyana I, 9, 3; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 95); so they had to pour out the fried grain three times.

[^394]: 168:13 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 18, 3; 13, 17; 14, 1.

[^395]: 169:14-15 14, 15. According to those teachers whose opinion is related in Sûtras 6-14, the leading round the fire, the treading on the stone, and the offering of fried grain (with the three parts of the Mantra, Sûtra 1 3) are repeated thrice; then follows the offering prescribed in Sûtra 14, so that the last two offerings follow immediately on each other. This is not the case, if in the first three instances the order of the different rites is inverted, as stated in Sûtra 15.
  In Sûtra 14 Nârâya<i>n</i>a explains _s<i>n</i>t<i>n</i>n_a.

[^408]: 172:5 Â<i>valâyana-</i>valâyana-<i>S</i>rauta II, 3, 1 seq. Nârâya<i>valâyana-</i>a: By the prohibition of meat which is expressed in the words ‘Except meat,’ it is to be understood that the food to be sacrificed, as stated in other <i>S</i>âstras, may likewise be chosen.

[^409]: 173:3 10, 3. See Â<i>valâyana-</i>valâyana-<i>S</i>rauta I, 3, 28 Scholion; Kâty.-<i>S</i>rauta II, 7, 22.

[^410]: 173:4 See Hillebrandt, Das altindische Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 111; my note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 3, 3.

[^411]: 173:12 In the Mantra we have a similar play upon words (iddha, p. 174 lit, or burning, and samedhaya, make us prosper) as in <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 10, 4.

[^412]: 174:13 Pâraskara I, 5, 3; <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 9, 5 seq.

[^413]: 174:14 <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 9, 7.

[^414]: 174:15 Professor Stenzler here very pertinently refers to <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 6, 3, 38.

[^415]: 174:16 It is doubtful whether this paragraph should be considered as forming part of the quotation from the <i>S</i>ruti. The object of this passage is, in my opinion, to explain why the southern Â<i>g</i>yabhâga belongs to Soma, who is the presiding deity of the north, and the northern Â<i>g</i>yabhâga to Agni, the presiding deity of the south-east. Professor Stenzler's opinion about this paragraph is somewhat different.

[^416]: 174:17 <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 9, 8.

[^417]: 175:19-20 19, 20. See above, the note on I, 7, 9 about the Avadâna portions and the peculiar custom of the descendants of <i>G</i>amadagni with regard to them.

[^418]: 175:22 Comp. above, I, 7, 10. ‘Here’ means, at the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t oblation.

[^419]: 175:23 Comp. Pâraskara I, 2, 11; <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a XIV, 9, 4, 24. On the oblations for general expiation (sarvaprâya<i>nd</i>ittâhuti) comp. Sâṅkh.-G<i>n</i>hya I, 9, 12, and the note.

[^420]: 175:24 ‘A full vessel which has been put down before, he should now pour out on the Barhis.’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a.

[^421]: 175:25 This pouring out of the vessel holds here the place of the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha bath at the end of the Soma sacrifice. See Weber, Indische Studien, X, 393 seq.

[^422]: 176:2 11, 2. The Sâmitra fire (literally, the fire of the Samit_ri_, who prepares the flesh of the immolated animal) is the one mentioned below in Sûtras 7 and 10. Comp. Indische Studien, X, 345. ‘I touch thee’ is upâkaromi; comp. Kâtyâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VI, 3, 19. 26.

[^423]: 176:6 It seems that this fire-brand is the same which had been carried round the animal, according to Sûtra 5. Comp. Kâtyâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VI, 5, 2-5.

[^424]: 177:7 Comp. Sûtra 2.

[^425]: 177:8 On the two Vapâ<i>s</i>rapa<i>s</i>îs, comp. Kâtyâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VI, 5, 7; Indische Studien, X, 345. The act which is here attributed to the kart<i>ri</i> (‘performer’), belongs in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual to the incumbencies of the Pratiprasthât_ri_.

[^426]: 177:10 On the way in which animals had to b. killed at sacrifices, see Weber's Indische Studien, IX, 222 seq.
  On the position of the head and the feet of the victim, comp. Kâtyâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VI, 5, 16. 17.
  According to Kâtyâyana VI, 6, 8 seq. a grass-blade is placed on the dead animal's body before the navel (agre<i>n</i>a nâbhim); through that grass-blade he cuts into the body and draws out the omentum.
  ‘That fire’ is, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, not the Sâmitra but the Aupâsana fire. In the same way in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual the warming of the omentum is performed at the Sâmitra, the boiling at the Âhavanîya fire. Kâtyâyana VI, 6, 13. 16.

[^427]: 177:11 The Aupâsana fire is referred to.

[^428]: 177:12 The eleven portions are indicated by Kâtyâyana, <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra VI, 7, 6.

[^429]: 178:14 ‘A Pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>âvattin cuts off three portions. Having performed the Upastara<i>ñ</i>a and the Pratyabhighâra<i>ñ</i>a (the first and second pouring out of Â<i>ñ</i>ya) he sacrifices (the cut-off portions).’ Nârâya<i>ñ</i>a.

[^430]: 178:15 On the rites regarding the spit, see Kâtyâyana VI, 10, 1 seq.; Indische Studien, X, 346.

[^431]: 178:1 12, 1. There seems to be no doubt that Professor Stenzler is right in giving to <i>k</i>aitya in this chapter its ordinary meaning of religious shrine (‘Denkmal’). The text shows that the Kaitya sacrifice was not offered like other sacrifices at the sacrificer's home, but that in some cases the offering would have to be sent, at least symbolically, to distant places. This confirms Professor Stenzler's translation of <i>k</i>aitya. Nârâya<i>n</i>a  explains _k<i>n</i>k_itte bhava, and says, 'If he makes a vow to a certain deity, saying, “If I obtain such and such a desire, I shall offer to thee an Â<i>n</i>ya sacrifice, or a Sthâlîpâka, or an animal”—and if he then obtains what he had wished for and ‘performs that sacrifice to that deity: this is a <i>k</i>aitya sacrifice.’ I do not know anything that supports this statement as to the meaning of <i>k</i>aitya.

[^432]: 178:2 ‘He should make of a leaf a messenger and a carrying-pole.’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a.
  It is not clear whether besides this image of a messenger there was also a real messenger who had to carry the Bali to the <i>K</i>aitya, p. 179 or whether the whole rite was purely symbolical, and based on the principle: In sacris ficta pro veris accipiuntur.

[^433]: 179:3 Comp. Pâraskara III, 11, 10.

[^434]: 179:6 Pâraskara III, 11, 11,

[^435]: 179:7 Comp. above, chap. 3, 6.

[^436]: 179:1 13, 1. Nârâya<i>n</i>a evidently did not know the Upanishad here referred to; he states that it belongs to another <i>S</i>âkhâ. Comp. Professor Max Müller's note on B<i>n</i>had Âra<i>n</i>yaka VI, 4, 24 (S.B.E., vol. xv, p. 222).

[^437]: 179:2 ‘He should give her the two beans as a symbol of the testicles, and the barley grain as a symbol of the penis.’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a.

[^438]: 180:5 Nârâya<i>n</i>a (comp. also the Prayogaratna, folio 40; Â<i>n</i>valâyanîya-G<i>n</i>hya-Pari<i>n</i>ish<i>n</i>a I, 25; NIS. Chambers 667) separates this rite from the ceremony described in Sûtras 2-4. He says that Sûtras 2-4—as indeed is evidently the case—refer to the Pu<i>n</i>savana, and in Sûtra 5 begins the Anavalobhana (comp. garbharaksha<i>n</i>a, Sâṅkh. I, 21). To me it seems more probable that the text describes one continuous ceremony. There is no difficulty in supposing that of the Anavalobhana, though it is mentioned in Sûtra 1, no description is given in the following Sûtras, the same being the case undoubtedly with regard to the Garbhalambhana, of which a description is found in the Â<i>n</i>v.-Pari<i>n</i>ish<i>n</i>a I, 25.

[^439]: 180:6 Two texts commencing â te garbho yonim etu and Agnir etu prathama_h_. See Stenzler's Various Readings, p. 48, and the Bibliotheca Indica edition, p. 61.

[^440]: 181:3 14, 3. Comp. above, chap. 8, 9. Regarding the two verses Dhâtâ dadâtu dâ<i>s</i>ushe, see <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>s</i>hya I, 22, 7. The Ne<i>s</i>amesha hymn is Rig-veda Khailika sûkta, vol. vi, p. 31, ed. Max Muller.

[^441]: 181:7 Comp. Pâraskara I, 15, 8. The Gâthâ there is somewhat different. I cannot see why in the Â<i>valâyana redaction of it nivish</i>valâyana redaction of it nivish<i>valâyana redaction of it nivish</i>a<i>valâyana redaction of it nivish</i>akrâsau should not be explained, conformably to the p. 182 regular Sandhi laws, as nivish<i>valâyana redaction of it nivish</i>a<i>valâyana redaction of it nivish</i>akrâ asau. The wheel of course means the dominion.

[^442]: 182:1 15, 1. Comp. Â<i>ri</i>v.-G<i>ri</i>hya-Pari<i>ri</i>ish<i>ri</i>a I, 26. I follow Professor Stenzler, who corrects maghonâm into maghonâ; comp. <i>S</i>âṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 24, 4.

[^443]: 182:3 Vedo may as well be the nominative of veda as that of vedas (‘property’).

[^444]: 183:1 16, 1 seq. Comp. Sâṅkh.-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 27, 1 seq. The two texts are nearly word for word identical.

[^445]: 184:4 He cuts off the hair four times on the right side (Sûtras 10-14), three times on the left side (Sûtra 15); each time three Ku<i>s</i>a bunches are required. This is the reason why twenty-one bunches are prescribed.

[^446]: 184:8 Each of the four times and of the three times respectively that he cuts off the hair; see the preceding note.

[^447]: 185:13 Instead of yena bhûya_s<i> </i>k_a râtryâm, Pâraskara (II, 1, 16) has, yena bhûri_s<i> </i>k_arâ divam.

[^448]: 185:16 Comp. Pâraskara II, I, 19; Atharva-veda VIII, 2, 17.

[^449]: 186:18 On these family customs, see G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha-pari<i>ri</i>ish<i>ri</i>a II, 40; Roth, Zur Literatur and Geschichte des Weda, p. 120; Max Müller, History of A. S. L., p. 54 seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 95.

[^450]: 186:4 18, 4. See above, chap. 17, 7.

[^451]: 186:5 See chap. 17, 16.

[^452]: 186:6 According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, he says to the barber (chap. 17, 17), ‘With lukewarm water doing what has to be done with water, without doing harm to him, arrange his hair, his beard, the hair of his body, and his nails, ending in the north.’

[^453]: 186:7-8 7, 8. On restrictions like that contained in the eighth Sûtra as to the object in which the vara (optional gift) had to consist, see Weber, Indische Studien, V, 343.

[^454]: 187:9 See below, chap. 22, 22.

[^455]: 187:10 19, 10. By the ‘arranging of the hair’ the cutting of the hair is implied, as is seen from chap. 22, 22.

[^456]: 188:2 20, 2. He offers the oblations prescribed above, chap. 1, 4, 3 seq.

[^457]: 189:11 On the wiping of the ground round the fire, comp. above, chap. 3, 1; <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 7, 11. Nârâya<i>ri</i>a here has the following remarks, which I can scarcely believe to express the real meaning of this Sûtra: ‘Here the wiping of the ground round the fire is out of place, because the Sa<i>ri</i>skâras for the fire have already been performed. As to that, it should be observed that the wiping is mentioned here in order that, when fuel is put on the fire in the evening and in the morning, the sprinkling of water and the wiping may be performed. But on this occasion (at the Upanayana) the student does not perform the wiping, &c., and silently puts a piece of wood on that fire.’

[^458]: 191:9 22, 9. Food for the Anuprava<i>k</i>anîya offering; see Sûtra 12.

[^459]: 191:10 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 6, 7; Pâraskara II, 5, 8.

[^460]: 191:12 ‘The student should, according to the rules for the Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as, cook the Anuprava<i>g</i>anîya food and announce it to the teacher in the words, “The food is cooked.”’ Nârâya<i>g</i>a.

[^461]: 192:15 Nârâya<i>n</i>a mentions as such texts especially those belonging to the Âra<i>n</i>yaka, viz. the Mahânâmnyas, the Mahâvrata, and the Upanishad. But there is no reason why we should not think quite as well of the Rig-veda Sa<i>n</i>hitâ itself.

  Su<i>s</i>ravas, which I have translated by ‘glorious,’ at the same time means, ‘endowed with good hearing,’ i.e. successful in study. The student therefore by the same word prays for glory and for success in Vedic learning.

[^465]: 193:22 The rules stated above for the Upanayana, beginning with the prescription regarding the cutting of the hair (given chap. 19, so in the words, ‘whose \[hair on the\] head is arranged;’ see the note there), and ending with the ceremony prescribed chap. 20, 8, are to be extended also to other cases of the imposing of a vow, such, for instance, as that mentioned chap. 18, 9.

[^472]: 194:4 The Ahîna sacrifices are those which last more than one day, but not more than twelve days. (Indische Studien, IX, 373; X, 355.) The priests officiating at such sacrifices are the sixteen stated in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra IV, 1, 6. 7. Those besides the sixteen, though they are chosen (saty api vara<i>n</i>e) for taking part in the sacred performances, have not the rank of _ri<i>n</i>g_as (officiating priests); such are the Sadasya, the Samit_ri_, and the _K<i>n</i>h_ (schol. <i>S</i>rautas. loc. cit.). See Max Müller's History of A. S. L., pp. 450, 469 seq. As to the Sadasya, however, there was some difference of opinion (see the next Sûtra).

[^473]: 194:5 On the office of the Sadasya, see Indische Studien, X, 136, 144.

[^474]: 194:6 The two <i>Rik<i>as quoted here belong to the tenth among the Vâlakhilya hymns, a hymn omitted in many of the Rig-veda MSS. They give no special confirmation to the rules stated in our text, but contain only a general allusion to the unity of the sacrifice, which the various priests perform in many various ways.

[^475]: 194:7 ‘If the four (chief) priests have to be chosen, the choosing of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a stands first in order (see above, Sûtra 3); if all (the sixteen), then the choosing of the Hot<i>ri</i> stands first in order.’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a.

[^476]: 195:12 The twelve priests of the sixteen (see § 4 note) who do not stand at the head of one of the four categories. Those at the head are enumerated in the Sutras

[^477]: 195:13-14 13, 14. See above, § 4 note.

[^478]: 195:19 Priests who only perform the Agnyâdheya for a person, are, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note on this Sûtra, not considered as p. 196 performing a sacrifice for him; consequently the formula given here is only to be used by priests who are elected for a Soma sacrifice. Stenzler translates, ‘So spricht er, wenn er das Opfer durch sie vollziehen lassen will.’ But this would be yakshyamâ<i>n</i>a_h_, not yâ<i>n</i>ayishyan.

[^479]: 196:20 The tradition takes nî<i>adakshi</i>adakshi<i>adakshi</i>asya as in apposition to ahînasya, and I have translated accordingly. But I cannot help thinking that the two words should be separated, so that we should have to translate, ‘or at an Ahîna, or for a person that gives small sacrificial fee.’ Thus the Brâhma<i>adakshi</i>a quoted by Âpastamba (see the commentary on the Pa<i>adakshi</i><i>adakshi</i>avi<i>adakshi</i><i>adakshi</i>a Brâhma<i>adakshi</i>a, vol. i, p. 6, ed. Bibl. Indica) gives the following questions which the Ritvi<i>g</i> to be chosen should ask, ‘Is it no Ahîna sacrifice? Is the Ritvi<i>g</i> office not abandoned by others? Is the sacrificial fee plentiful?’ It is a very singular fact, that on the one hand the assistance of a number of _Ri<i>adakshi</i>g_as was unanimously declared necessary for the performance of an Ahîna sacrifice, while on the other hand it was considered objectionable, at least among some of the Vedic schools, to officiate at such a sacrifice. See Weber's Indische Studien, X, 150, 151.
  On anude<i>s</i>yabhi<i>s</i>asta Nârâya<i>s</i>a says, sade<i>s</i>inâbhi<i>s</i>astasyaivam eke. anye tu _s<i>s</i>h_. It seems to me that anude<i>s</i>ya (or rather ânude<i>s</i>ya?) in _S<i>s</i>S_raut. V, 1, 10 (Indische Studien, X, 147) means the same, though the commentary on that Sûtra ascribes a different meaning to that word.
