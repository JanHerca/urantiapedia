<span id="an26"></span>

## SÛTRA XXVI.

If the <i>g</i>uhû has been elsewhere employed, let it be done with a ladle (sruva).

<span id="an26c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The _g<i>uhû is a sru</i>k_, a spoon, the sruva, a ladle.

<span id="an27"></span>

## SÛTRA XXVII.

The offering is made in the Âhavanîya fire.

<span id="an28"></span>

## SÛTRA XXVIII.

The sacrificial vessels are kept from the first laying of the fires (âdhâna) for the whole life.

<span id="an28c"></span>

**Commentary.**

All sacrificial vessels and instruments are to be kept, and most of them are burnt with the sacrificer at his death.

<span id="an29"></span>

## SÛTRA XXIX.

At every sacrifice these vessels are to be purified.

<span id="an30"></span>

## SÛTRA XXX.

The rule for the sacrifice are the Mantras and Brâhma<i>n</i>as.

<span id="an31"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXI.

The name Veda belongs both to the Mantras and Brâhma<i>n</i>as. <span id="p324"><sup><small>[ p. 324 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an32"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXII.

The Brâhma<i>n</i>as are the precepts for the sacrifice.

<span id="an33"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXIII.

The rest of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, that which does not contain precepts, consists of explanations, i.e. reproof, praise, stories, and traditions.

<span id="an33c"></span>

**Commentary.**

It is difficult to find words corresponding to technical terms in Sanskrit. Arthavâda, which I have translated by explanation, means not only the telling of the meaning, but likewise the telling of the object; parak<i>ri</i>ti, story, means literally the action of another; purâkalpa, traditions, means the former state. The difference between the two is stated to be that parak<i>ri</i>ti refers to the act of one person, purâkalpa to that of several. This subject is fully treated in the Pûrva-mîmâ<i>ri</i>sâ. Satyavrata begins a new Sûtra with ‘reproof’ (nindâ).

<span id="an34"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXIV.

All the rest are Mantras.

<span id="an35"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXV.

But passages which are not handed down, are not to be classed as Mantras, as, for instance, the pravara, the words used in choosing priests, divine or human; ûha, substitution of one word for another; and nâmadheya-graha<i>n</i>a, the mentioning of the names of particular sacrificers.

<span id="an35c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The reason why such passages are not to be treated as Mantras is that they should not be subject to some of the preceding rules, as, for instance, the murmuring, enjoined in Sûtra IX. Those passages naturally vary in each sacrifice. With regard to the names a distinction is made <span id="p325"><sup><small>[ p. 325 ]</small></sup></span> between the gârhyam nâma, the domestic name of a person, such as Ya<i>g</i><i>g</i>a<i>g</i>arman, and the astrological name, such as Rauhi<i>g</i>a, derived from the star Rohi<i>g</i>î.

<span id="an36"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXVI.

Likewise the sound of a carriage and the sound of a drum.

<span id="an36c"></span>

**Commentary.**

These sounds, though serving for the sacrifice, are not to be considered as liable to the rules given for the recitation of Mantras.

<span id="an37"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXVII.

The prohibition of reciting Mantras in the Svâdhyâya does not apply to the sacrifice, because there is then a different object.

<span id="an37c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Svâdhyâya, i.e. self-reading, is the name given to the study of the Veda, both in first learning and in afterwards repeating it. This study is under several restrictions, but these restrictions cease when the Veda is used for sacrificial purposes.

<span id="an38"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXVIII.

Sacrificial acts are accompanied by one Mantra.

<span id="an38c"></span>

**Commentary.**

If it is said that the priest cuts the plants with fourteen verses, that means that there are fourteen plants to be cut and that one verse is used for each plant.

<span id="an39"></span>

## SÛTRA XXXIX.

This applies also to sacrificial acts which have a number and are to be carried out by separate (repeated) acts. <span id="p326"><sup><small>[ p. 326 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an39c"></span>

**Commentary.**

If a rule is given, such as tri<i>h</i> prokshati, he sprinkles thrice, the mantra which accompanies the act, is recited once only. Again in the case of acts that require repetitions, such as rubbing, pounding, &c., the hymns are recited once only.

<span id="an40"></span>

## SÛTRA XL.

The same applies to rubbing, sleeping, crossing a river, down-pours of rain, the conjuring of unlucky omens, unless they happened some time ago.

<span id="an40c"></span>

**Commentary.**

If several members of the body are to be rubbed, the verses required for the purpose are recited once only. A prayer is enjoined if one wakes during the night. If one wakes more than once that prayer is. not to be repeated. In crossing a river the necessary verse is not to be repeated at every wave, nor during a down-pour, at every drop of rain. If some unlucky sight has to be conjured, the conjuring verse is spoken once and not repeated, unless some time has elapsed and a new unlucky sight presents itself.

<span id="an41"></span>

## SÛTRA XLI.

In case of a journey, however, one hymn is used till the object (of the journey) has been accomplished.

<span id="an41c"></span>

**Commentary.**

I read prayâ<i>n</i>e tu-â-arthanirv<i>n</i>tte_h_. Another reading is arthani<i>n</i>ritti_h_.

<span id="an42"></span>

## SÛTRA XLII.

It is the same also with regard to acts which do not produce an immediate effect.

<span id="an42c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The commentators distinguish between acts which <span id="p327"><sup><small>[ p. 327 ]</small></sup></span> produce a visible effect, such as pounding or sprinkling, and acts which do not, such as addressing, approaching, looking. The latter are called asa<i>m</i>nipâtin. Thus when the stones used for the preparation of Soma are addressed, the hymn which is used for addressing them, is not repeated for each single stone, the same as in Sûtra XL. Sûtras XLI and XLII are sometimes joined.

<span id="an43"></span>

## SÛTRA XLIII.

Repetition takes place in the case of the Havishk<i>ri</i>t, Adhrigu, Puronuvâkyâ, and Manotâ hymns, (because they have to be used) at different times.

<span id="an43c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Havishk<i>ri</i>t-adhrigu-puronuvâkyâ-manotam is to be taken as a Dvandva compound.

The Havishk<i>ri</i>t hymn is an invocation when the havis is made. The Adhrigu hymn is ‘Daivyâ_h<i>ri</i>s<i>ri</i>h_,’ &c. The Puronuvâkyâ hymn is that which precedes the Yâ<i>ri</i>yâ, immediately after the Sampraisha. The Manotâ hymn is ‘Tva<i>m</i> hy agne prathamo manotâ,’ &c. These hymns are to be repeated, if the act which they accompany has to be repeated after a certain interval.

<span id="an44"></span>

## SÛTRA XLIV.

When it is expressly stated, one sacrificial act may be accompanied by many hymns.

<span id="an44c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Thus we read, ‘He takes the Abhri, the hoe, with four Mantras.’

<span id="an45"></span>

## SÛTRA XLV.

One ought to let the beginnings of a sacrificial act coincide with the end of the Mantras. <span id="p328"><sup><small>[ p. 328 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an45c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The mantra which indicates the nature and purpose of a sacrificial act should come first, and as soon as it has been finished the act should follow. See Katy. I, 3, 5.

<span id="an46"></span>

## SÛTRA XLVI.

In the case of the âghâra, sprinkling of clarified butter, and of dhârâ, pouring out of Soma, the beginning of the mantra and the act takes place at the same time.

<span id="an47"></span>

## SÛTRA XLVII.

Mantras are indicated by their first words.

<span id="an47c"></span>

**Commentary.**

These first words are often called Pratîkas, and rules are given in Â<i>valâyana's </i>valâyana's <i>S</i>rauta-sûtras I, 1, 17-19, as to the number of words that should form such a pratîka, if it is meant for one verse, for three verses, or for a whole hymn. According to Â<i>valâyana's </i>valâyana, if one foot is quoted, it is meant for a verse; if an imperfect foot of an initial verse is quoted, it is meant for a whole hymn; if more than a foot is quoted, it is meant for three verses.

<span id="an48"></span>

## SÛTRA XLVIII.

One should know that with the beginning of a following mantra, the former mantra is finished.

<span id="an49"></span>

## SÛTRA XLIX.

In the case of Hotrâ and Yâ<i>g</i>amâna-mantras, an aggregation takes place.

<span id="an49c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Hotrâs are mantras recited by the Hot_ri_\-priest. Yâ<i>g</i>amânâs are mantras recited by the sacrificer himself. They are hymns which accompany, but do not enjoin any sacrificial act. <span id="p329"><sup><small>[ p. 329 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an50"></span>

## SÛTRA L.

In the case of the Yâ<i>g</i>yâs and Anuvâkyâs this (the aggregation) is optional.

<span id="an50c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Yâ<i>g</i>yâ is explained by praya<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati yâ<i>g</i>yayâ, the Anuvâkyâ by âhvayaty anuvâkyayâ. Sometimes more than one are mentioned, but in that case the priest is free to do as he likes. According to the same principle, when we read that one should sacrifice with rice or with barley, that means that rice should be used after the rice-harvest, barley after the barley-harvest, and not that rice and barley should be used at the same time.
