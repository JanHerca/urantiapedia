## KÂ_N__D_A III, KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 1.

1\. [^865]. (Now shall be explained) the partaking of the first-fruits (of the harvest), of a person who has not set up the (sacred <i>S</i>rauta) fires.

2\. [^866]. He cooks a mess of fresh sacrificial food, sacrifices the two Â<i>g</i>ya portions, and two Â<i>g</i>ya oblations, (with the formulas),

‘To the hundredfold armed, hundredfold valiant, hundredfold blissful one, the vanquisher of enemies—he who may create a hundred autumns for us, Indra,—may he lead us across (the gulf of) misfortune. Svâhâ!

‘The four paths that go between heaven and earth, trodden by the gods—of these (paths) lead us to that which may bring us freedom from decay and decline, O all ye gods. Svâhâ!’

3\. [^867]. Having made oblations of the mess of cooked food to the Âgraya<i>n</i>a deities, he makes another oblation to (Agni) Svish<i>n</i>ak<i>n</i>t with (the verse), ‘Agni, make this (sacrifice) full, that it may be well offered. And may the god destroy all hostile powers. Come hither, showing us a good path. Bestow on us long life, full of splendour and free from decay. Svâhâ!’

4\. He then eats (of the fresh fruits with the <span id="p338"><sup><small>[ p. 338 ]</small></sup></span> verses), 'May Agni eat first, for he knows how the Havis (is fit for sacrifice); may he, the friend of all human tribes, make the herbs blessed to us.

From the good you have led us to the better, ye gods! Through thee, the nourishment, may we obtain thee. Thus enter into us, O potion, bringing refreshment, for the good of our children and of ourselves, and pleasant.’

5\. [^868]. Or with the (verse) sacred to Annapati (the Lord of food).

6\. [^869]. For barley, however, (he uses the Mantra), ‘This barley, mixed with honey, they have ploughed through Sarasvatî under Manu. Indra was lord of the plough, the hundredfold wise one; ploughers were the Maruts, the exuberant givers.’

7\. Then (follows) the feeding of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 2.

1\. On the full-moon day of Mârga<i>îrsha the Âgrahâya</i>îrsha the Âgrahâya<i>îrsha the Âgrahâya</i>î ceremony (is performed).

2\. [^870]. He cooks a mess of sacrificial food, sacrifices two Â<i>ya oblations as at the </i>ya oblations as at the _S<i>ya oblations as at the </i>n_â sacrifice, and other oblations with (the following verses):

‘The night whom men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night) which is the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us. Svâhâ!

<span id="p339"><sup><small>[ p. 339 ]</small></sup></span>

‘The night which is the image of the year, that we worship. May I reach old age, imparting strength to my offspring. Svâhâ!

‘To the Sa<i>m</i>vatsara, to the Parivatsara, to the Idâvatsara, to the Idâvatsara, to the Vatsara bring ye great adoration. May we, undecayed, unbeaten, long enjoy the favour of these (years) which are worthy of sacrifices. Svâhâ!

‘May summer, winter and spring, the rains be friendly, and may autumn be free of danger to us. In the safe protection of these seasons may we dwell, (and) may (they) last (to us) through a hundred years. Svâhâ!’

3\. He makes oblations of the cooked food to Soma, to (the Nakshatra) M<i>ri</i>ga<i>ri</i>iras, to the full moon of Mârga<i>ri</i>îrsha, and to the winter.

4\. [^871]. After he has eaten (of the sacrificial food), he throws the remainder of the flour into a basket, (and then follow the same rites that have been stated above) from (the sacrificer's) going out down to their cleaning themselves.

5\. After the cleaning he says, ‘The Bali offering is finished.’

6\. [^872]. After they have spread out to the west of the fire a layer (of straw) and a garment that has <span id="p340"><sup><small>[ p. 340 ]</small></sup></span> not yet been washed, they ‘redescend,’ having bathed, wearing garments which have not yet been washed: the master (of the house) southward, his wife to the north (of her husband, and then the other persons belonging to the house) so that each younger one lies more to the north.

7\. Having caused the Brahman to sit down southward, and having placed to the north a water-pot, a <i>S</i>amî branch, an earth-clod taken out of a furrow, and a stone, he murmurs, looking at the fire: ‘This Agni is most valiant, he is most blessed, the best giver of a thousand boons, highly powerful. May he establish us both in the highest place.’

8\. To the west of the fire he joins his hands (and holds them) towards the east.

9\. With the three (verses), ‘The divine ship’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXI, 6-8) they ascend the layer (of straw).

10\. [^873]. He addresses the Brahman: ‘Brahman, we will redescend.’

11\. The Brahman having given his permission, they redescend with (the words), ‘Life, fame, glory, strength, enjoyment of food, offspring!’

12\. [^874]. Those who have received the initiation murmur, ‘May a good winter, a good spring, a good summer be bestowed on us. Blessed may be to us the rains; may the autumns be blessed to us.’

13\. With (the verse), ‘Be soft to us, O earth’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXXV, 21), they lie down on their right sides, their heads turned towards the east. <span id="p341"><sup><small>[ p. 341 ]</small></sup></span>

14 [14](#fn875). They arise with (the verse), 'Up! with life, with blessed life. Up! with Par<i>m</i>anya's eye, with the seven spaces of the earth.’

15\. This (they repeat) two other times, with the Brahman's permission.

16\. Let them sleep on the ground four months (after the Pratyavaroha<i>n</i>a), or as long as they like.

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 3.

1\. [^876]. After the Âgrahâya<i>t</i>î (full moon follow) the three Ash<i>t</i>akâs.

2\. [^877]. (The Ash<i>t</i>akâ is) sacred to Indra, to the Vi<i>t</i>ve devâs, to Pra<i>t</i>âpati, and to the Fathers.

4\. The first Ash<i>t</i>akâ (is celebrated) on the eighth day of the fortnight.

5\. [^879]. Having cooked a mess of sacrificial food and having sacrificed the two Â<i>g</i>ya portions, he sacrifices Â<i>g</i>ya oblations with (the texts):

(a [^880]) 'Thirty sisters go to the appointed place, <span id="p342"><sup><small>[ p. 342 ]</small></sup></span> putting on the same badge. They spread out the seasons, the knowing sages; having the metres in their midst they walk around, the brilliant ones. Svâhâ!

(b) 'The shining one clothes herself with clouds, with the ways of the sun, the divine night: manifold animals which are born, look about in this mother's lap. Svâhâ!

(c) 'The Ekâsh<i>t</i>akâ, devoting herself to austerities, has given birth to a child, to the majesty of Indra. Through him the gods have conquered the hostile tribes; he became the killer of the Asuras through his (divine) powers. Svâhâ!

(d [^881]) 'You have made me who am not the younger (sister), the younger; speaking the truth I desire this: may I be in his (i.e. the sacrificer's?) favour, as you are; may none of you supplant the other in her work.

(e) 'In my favour dwelt the omniscient one; he has found a firm standing; he has got a footing. May I be in his (i.e. the sacrificer's?) favour, as you are; may none of you supplant the other in her work.

(f [^882]) 'On the five dawns follows the fivefold milking; on the cow with the five names, the rive seasons. The five regions (of the sky) are established <span id="p343"><sup><small>[ p. 343 ]</small></sup></span> through the fifteenfold (Stoma); with one common face (they look over) the one world. Svâhâ!

(g) 'She who shone forth as the first, is the child of truth. One (of them) bears the majesty of the waters; one wanders in the courses of the sun; one (in those) of the heat; Savit<i>ri</i> shall govern one. Svâhâ!

(h) 'She who shone forth as the first has become a cow in Yama's realm. Give us milk, thou who art rich in milk, year by year. Svâhâ!

(i [^883]) 'She, the owner of bright bulls, has come to us with clouds and with light, she who has all shapes, the motley one, whose banner is fire. Carrying on the common work, leading us to old age, come to us thou who art exempt from old age, Ushas! Svâhâ!

(k) ‘The consort of the seasons, the first one has come to us, the leader of days, the producer of offspring. Being one, thou shinest manifold, Ushas. Being free from old age, thou leadest to old age everything else. Svâhâ!’

6\. [^884]. He makes offerings of the mess of cooked food with (the verses):

‘May the earth be peaceful, the air friendly to us; <span id="p344"><sup><small>[ p. 344 ]</small></sup></span> may the heavens give us bliss and safety. May the points (of the horizon), the intermediate points, the upper points give us bliss, and may day and night create long life for us. Svâhâ!

‘May the waters, the rays protect us from all sides; may the creator, may the ocean turn away evil. The present and the future, may all be safe for me. Protected by Brahman, may I be well guarded. Svâhâ!

‘May all Âdityas and the divine Vasus, may the Rudras and Maruts be our protectors. May Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the highest lord, bestow on us vigour, offspring, immortality, long life. Svâhâ!’

7\. And with (the formula), ‘To the Ash<i>t</i>akâ Svâhâ!’

8\. The middle Ash<i>t</i>akâ (is celebrated) with (the sacrifice of) a cow.

9\. He sacrifices the omentum of that (cow) with (the verse), ‘Carry the omentum, O <i>G</i>âtavedas, to the fathers’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXXV, 20).

10\. On the day following each (Ash<i>t</i>akâ), the Anvash<i>t</i>akâ day, (he brings a sacrifice) with the left ribs and the left thigh, in an enclosure, according to (the ritual of) the Pi<i>t</i><i>t</i>apit<i>t</i>ya<i>t</i><i>t</i>a.

11\. Also to the female (ancestors he makes Pi<i>nd</i>a offerings) and pours (for them) strong liquor and water oblations into pits, and (offers) collyrium, salves, and garlands.

12\. (He may also make oblations), if he likes, to the teacher and to the pupils who have no children. <span id="p345"><sup><small>[ p. 345 ]</small></sup></span>

13 [^885]. And in the middle of the rainy season (there is) a fourth Ash<i>t</i>akâ on which vegetables are offered.

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 4.

1\. Now the building of the house.

2\. Let him have his house built on an auspicious day.

3\. [^886]. Into the pits (in which the posts shall be erected) he pours an oblation with (the words), ‘To the steady one, the earth-demon, svâhâ!’

4\. [^887]. He erects the post.

‘This navel of the world I set up, a stream of wealth, promoting wealth. Here I erect a firm house; may it stand in peace, dropping ghee.

‘Rich in horses and cows, rich in delight be set up, for the sake of great happiness. To thee may the young calf cry, to thee the lowing cows, the milk-cows.

‘To thee (may) the young child (go), to thee the calf with its companions, to thee the cup of Parisrut, to thee (may they go) with pots of curds.

<span id="p346"><sup><small>[ p. 346 ]</small></sup></span>

‘The consort of Peace, the great one, beautifully attired—bestow on us, O blessed one, wealth and manly power, which may be rich in horses and cows, full of sap like a tree's leaf. May our wealth increase here, clothing itself with prospering'—with (these four Mantras) he approaches the four (posts).

5\. Having established the fire inside (the house), having made the Brahman sit down towards the south, having placed a water-pot to the north, and cooked a mess of sacrificial food, he goes out (of the house), and standing near the door, he addresses the Brahman, ‘Brahman, I enter (the house)!’

6\. When the Brahman has given his consent, he enters with (the formula), ‘To right I advance, to luck I advance!’

7\. [^888]. Having prepared Â<i>ya and sacrificed two Â</i>ya and sacrificed two Â<i>ya and sacrificed two Â</i>ya oblations with (the two parts of the Mantra), ‘Here is joy’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>ya and sacrificed two Â</i>h. VIII, 51 a), he sacrifices other oblations with (the verses):

(a) 'Vâstoshpati! Receive us (into thy protection); give us good entering and drive away from us evil. For what we ask thee, with that favour us: be a saviour to us, to men and animals. Svâhâ!

(b) 'Vâstoshpati! Be our furtherer; make our wealth increase in cows and horses, O Indu (i.e. Soma). Free from decay may we dwell in thy friendship; give us thy favour, as a father to his sons. Svâhâ!

(c) 'Vâstoshpati! Let us be in a fellowship with thee, which may be valiant, joyful, and well proceeding. Protect our wishes when we rest and <span id="p347"><sup><small>[ p. 347 ]</small></sup></span> when we do our work. Protect us always, ye (gods), and give us welfare. Svâhâ!

(d) 'Driving away calamity, Vâstoshpati, assuming all shapes, be a kind friend to us. Svâhâ!

8\. He makes offerings of the mess of cooked food (with the following Mantras):

(a [^889]) Agni, Indra, B<i>ri</i>haspati, the Vi<i>ri</i>ve devâs I invoke, Sarasvatî and Vâ<i>ri</i>î. Give me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones. Svâhâ!

(b [^890]) 'To all the divine hosts of serpents, to the Himavat, the Sudar<i>s</i>ana (mountain), and the Vasus, Rudras, Âdityas, Î<i>s</i>âna with his companions, to all these I apply. Give me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones. Svâhâ!

(c) 'To forenoon and afternoon both together with noon, to evening and midnight, to the goddess of dawn with her wide path, to all these I apply. Give me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones. Svâhâ!

(e) 'To Dhât<i>ri</i> and Vidhât_ri_, and to the Lord of treasures together with them, to all these I apply. Give me a dwelling-place, ye vigorous ones. Svâhâ!

(f) ‘As a lucky, a happy (place), give me this dwelling-place, Brahman and Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and all deities. Svâhâ!’

9\. After he has partaken (of the sacrificial food), let him put into a brass vessel the different things which he has brought together, Udumbara leaves with strong liquor, green turf, cowdung, curds, <span id="p348"><sup><small>[ p. 348 ]</small></sup></span> honey, ghee, Ku<i>s</i>a grass, and barley, and let him besprinkle the seats and shrines (for the images of the gods).

10\. He touches (the wall and the posts) at their eastern juncture with (the words), ‘May luck and glory protect thee at thy eastern juncture.’

13\. He touches (them) at their northern juncture with (the words), ‘May vigour and delight protect thee at thy northern juncture.’

14\. He then goes out (of the house) and worships the quarters (of the horizon, the east) with (the formulas), 'May Ketâ (i.e. will?) and Suketâ (i.e. good-will?) protect me from the east.

‘Agni is Ketâ; the Sun is Suketâ: to them I apply; to them be adoration; may they protect me from the east.’

15\. Then to the south: 'May that which protects and that which guards, protect me from the south.

‘The Day is that which protects; the Night is that which guards; to them I apply; to them be adoration; may they protect me from the south.’

16\. Then to the west: 'May the shining one and the waking one protect me from the west.

‘Food is the shining one; Breath is the waking one; to them I apply; to them be adoration; may they protect me from the west.’

17\. Then to the north: 'May the sleepless one and the not-slumbering one protect me from the north.

<span id="p349"><sup><small>[ p. 349 ]</small></sup></span>

‘The Moon is the sleepless one; the Wind is the not-slumbering one; to them I apply; to them be adoration; may they protect me from the north.’

18\. [^891]. When (the house) is finished, he enters it with (the formulas),

‘Law, the chief post! Fortune, the pinnacle! Day and night, the two door-boards!

‘Indra's house is wealthy, protecting; that I enter with my children, with my cattle, with everything that is mine.

‘Hither is called the whole number (of relatives), the friends whose coming is good. Thus (I enter) thee, O house. May our dwellings be full of inviolable heroes from all sides!’

19\. Then (follows) feeding of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 5.

1\. Now (follows) the putting up of the water-barrel.

2\. To the north-east he digs a pit like (the pit for) a sacrificial post, strews into it Ku<i>s</i>a grass, fried grains, fruits of the soap-tree, and other auspicious things, and therein he establishes the water-barrel with (the words), ‘The sea art thou.’

3\. [^892]. He pours water into it with (the verse), ‘Ye <span id="p350"><sup><small>[ p. 350 ]</small></sup></span> waters, rich in wealth, ye possess goods. Ye bring us good insight and immortality. Ye are the rulers over wealth and blessed offspring. May Sarasvatî give strength to him who praises her!’—

4\. And with the three (verses), ‘O waters, ye are’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>hitâ XI, 50 seqq.).

1\. Now the cure for headache.

2\. Having moistened his hands, he passes them over his eye-brows with (the verse), ‘From the eyes, from the ears, from the whiskers, from the chin, from the forehead, I drive away this disease of the head.’

3\. If (only) one side (of the head aches, he recites the verse), ‘Cleaver! Thou with the disfigured eyes! White-wing! Renowned one! And thou with the various-coloured wing! Let his head not ache.’

‘Run-away servant, I have made water round thee. Having been watered round, where wilt thou go?’

3\. [^894]. Should he run away (nevertheless, his master) should establish a fire that has been taken from a wood that is on fire, and should sacrifice (in that fire) Ku<i>s</i>a plates (used for protecting the hands when holding a hot sacrificial pan) that have been anointed with ghee, with (the formula), 'May the stumbler stumble round thee, . . . . may he tie thee with Indra's fetter, loosen thee for me, and may he lead another one up (to me).’

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 8.

1\. [^896]. The spit-ox (sacrificed to Rudra).

2\. [^897]. It procures (to the sacrificer) heavenly rewards, cattle, sons, wealth, renown, long life.

3\. [^898]. Having taken the sacred domestic fire to the <span id="p352"><sup><small>[ p. 352 ]</small></sup></span> forest, and having performed the ‘outspreading,’ he should sacrifice the animal to Rudra.

5\. [^899]. Or (it may be) a cow, on account of the designation.

6\. [^900].

7\. (Then follows a sacrifice to) Vanaspati.

8\. (To Agni) Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t at the end.

9\. [^901]. Then (follows) the sprinkling round to the different quarters (of the horizon).

10\. [^902]. After the sprinkling has been performed, they sacrifice the Patnî-sa<i>m</i>yâ<i>m</i>a offerings to Indrâ<i>m</i>î, Rudrâ<i>m</i>î, _S<i>m</i>n_i, Bhavânî, and Agni G<i>m</i>hapati.

11\. [^903]. The blood he offers in leaves, on (grass-) bunches, as a Bali to Rudra and to his hosts, with (the Mantras),

And besides they should adorn the best four young cows of the herd and let them loose with this (verse), ‘This young (bull) I give you as your husband; run about sporting with him, your lover. Do not bring down a curse upon us, by nature blessed ones. May we rejoice in increase of wealth and in comfort.’

7\. [^913]. When (the bull) stands in the midst of the cows, he recites over it (the texts beginning with) ‘Bringing refreshment,’ down to the end of the Anuvâka (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XVIII, 45-50).

21\. They pour out with joined hands one libation of water to the deceased person with (the words), ‘N.N.! This water to thee!’

22\. When they have come out (of the water) and <span id="p357"><sup><small>[ p. 357 ]</small></sup></span> have sat down on a pure spot that is covered with grass, (those who are versed in ancient tales) should entertain them (by telling such tales).

23\. [^921]. They return to the village without looking back, in one row, the youngest walking in front.

24\. [^922]. In the doors of their houses they chew leaves of the Pi<i>k</i>umanda (or Nimba) tree, sip water, touch water, fire, cowdung, white mustard seeds, and oil, tread upon a stone, and then they enter.

25\. [^923]. Through a period of three nights they should remain chaste, sleep on the ground, do no work and charge nobody (to do it for them).

26\. Let them eat food which they have bought or received (from. others); (they should eat it) only in the day-time, (and should eat) no meat.

27\. [^924]. Having offered to the deceased person the Pi<i>nd</i>a, naming his name at the washing, at the offering (of the Pi<i>nd</i>a), and at the second washing—

28\. [^925]. They should that night put milk and water in an earthen vessel into the open air with (the words), ‘Deceased one, bathe here!’

29\. [^926]. The impurity caused by death lasts through three nights;

30\. Through ten nights, according to some (teachers).

31\. (During that period they) should not perform Svâdhyâya (or study the Vedic texts for themselves). <span id="p358"><sup><small>[ p. 358 ]</small></sup></span>

32\. They should intermit the standing rites, except those performed with the three (<i>S</i>rauta) fires,

33\. And (with the exception of those performed) with the (sacred) domestic fire, according to some (teachers).

34\. Others should perform (those rites for them).

35\. Those who have touched the dead body should not enter the village until the stars appear.

36\. If (they have touched it) in the night-time, (they should not enter) till sunrise.

37\. [^927]. The entering and what follows after it is the same (for these persons) as for the others.

38\. (Their) impurity lasts through one or two fortnights.

39\. The same (rites should be performed) when the teacher (has died),

40\. Or the maternal grandfather or grandmother,

41\. Or unmarried females.

42\. [^928]. For those who were married, the others should do it,

43\. [^929]. And they for the (others).

44\. [^930]. If one dies while being absent on a journey, (his relations) shall sit (on the ground, as prescribed for impure persons) from the time when they have heard (of his death), performing the water libation <span id="p359"><sup><small>[ p. 359 ]</small></sup></span> (at that time), until the period (of their impurity) has expired;

45\. If (that period has already) elapsed, through one night or three nights.

46\. Optional is the water libation for an officiating priest, a father-in-law, a friend, for (distant) relations, for a maternal uncle, and for a sister's son;

47\. [^931]. And for married females.

48\. On the eleventh day he should give to an uneven number of Brâhma<i>n</i>as a meal at which meat is served.

49\. Some also kill a cow in honour of the deceased person.

50\. When the Pi<i>nd</i>as are prepared, the deceased person, if he has sons, shall be considered as the first of the (three) Fathers (to whom Pi<i>nd</i>as are offered).

51\. [^932]. The fourth one should be left out.

52\. [^933]. Some (make Pi<i>nd</i>a offerings to a deceased person) separately through one year (before admitting him to a share in the common Pit<i>n</i>ya<i>nd</i>a).

53\. [^934]. But there is a rule, ‘There can be no fourth Pi<i>nd</i>a’—for this is stated in the <i>S</i>ruti.

54\. [^935]. Every day he shall give food to him (i.e. to the deceased person), and if he was a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, a vessel with water.

55\. Some offer also a. Pi<i>nd</i>a.



<span id="p360"><sup><small>[ p. 360 ]</small></sup></span>

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 11.

1\. [^936]. If an animal (is to be sacrificed), let him wash it, if it is not a cow; let him walk round the fires and drive in front (of them) a Palâ<i>s</i>a branch into the ground.

2\. [^937]. The winding (of a Ku<i>s</i>a rope) round (that branch), the touching (of the animal with the grass-blade), the binding (of it to the branch), and the sprinkling (of the animal with water) should be performed in the way prescribed (in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra), and whatever else (is to be done).

3\. [^938]. After he has sacrificed the two oblations before and after the killing of the animal, (he) silently (sacrifices) five other (oblations, directed to Pra<i>g</i>âpati).

4\. [^939]. And the omentum is taken out (of the killed animal). He should besprinkle it (with water) and name the deity (to whom the sacrifice is directed).

5\. [^940]. (He should name that deity also) at the touching (of the animal with the grass-blade), at (its) being bound (to the branch), at its being sprinkled (with water), and at (the preparation and oblation) of the mess of cooked food.

6\. After he has sacrificed the omentum, he cuts off the Avadâna portions, <span id="p361"><sup><small>[ p. 361 ]</small></sup></span>

7 [^941]. All of them, or three, or five.

8\. [^942]. He sacrifices the Avadâna portions together with the mess of cooked food.

9\. A limb of the animal is the sacrificial fee.

10\. [^943]. At (a sacrifice) directed to a special deity he should sacrifice (an animal) belonging to that deity, should make a portion for that (god), and should say to him (i.e. to the messenger who is to convey that offering to a place sacred to that deity): ‘Take care that this may reach that (god).’

11\. If there is a river between (the sacrificer and that sacred place), he may have a boat made, or he may dispense with this.

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 12.

1\. [^944]. Now (follows) the penance for a student who has broken the vow of chastity.

2\. On a new-moon day he shall sacrifice an ass on a cross-road (to the goddess Nir<i>ri</i>ti).

3\. (And) he shall offer a mess of cooked food to Nir<i>ri</i>ti.

4\. [^945]. The Avadâna portions are sacrificed into water (and not into fire). <span id="p362"><sup><small>[ p. 362 ]</small></sup></span>

5 [^946]. The Puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>a (or sacrificial cake), which belongs to the animal sacrifice, is cooked on the ground (and not in the Kapâlas).

6\. (The guilty person) should put on the skin (of the ass),

7\. With the tail turned upwards, according to some (teachers).

8\. He should through one year go about for alms, proclaiming his deed.

9\. [^947]. After that time he sacrifices two Â<i>g</i>ya oblations with (the formulas), ‘O Lust, I have broken my vow of chastity. I have broken my vow of chastity, O Lust. To Lust svâhâ!’—‘O Lust, I have done evil. I have done evil, O Lust. To Lust svâhâ!’

10\. [^948]. He then approaches (the fire) with (the verse), May the Maruts besprinkle me, may Indra, may B<i>ri</i>haspati, may this Agni besprinkle me with offspring and with wealth.’

11\. This is the penance.

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 13.

1\. Now the entering of a court of justice.

2\. [^949]. He approaches the court with (the words), Court! Thou that belongest to the Aṅgiras! Trouble art thou by name; vehemence art thou by name. Thus be adoration to thee!

3\. [^950]. He then enters (the court) with (the words), ‘(May) the court and the assembly, the two unanimous <span id="p363"><sup><small>[ p. 363 ]</small></sup></span> daughters of Pra<i>g</i>âpati (protect me). May one who does not know me, be below me. May (all) people be considerate in what they say.’

4\. When he has arrived at the assembly, he should murmur, ‘Superior (to my adversaries) I have come hither, brilliant, not to be contradicted. The lord of this assembly is a man insuperable in his power.’

5\. [^951]. Should he think, ‘This person is angry with me,’ he addresses him with (the verses), The destroying power of wrath and anger that dwells here on thy forehead, that the chaste, wise gods may take away.

‘Heaven am I and I am Earth; we both take away thy anger; the she-mule cannot bring forth offspring; N.N.!’

6\. [^952]. But if he should think, ‘This person will do evil to me,’ he addresses him with (the words), ‘I take away the speech in thy mouth, I take away (the speech) in thy heart. Wheresoever thy speech dwells, thence I take it away. What I say, is true. Fall down, inferior to me.’

7\. The same is the way to make (a person) subject (to one's self).

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 14.

1\. Now the mounting of a chariot (is declared).

2\. After he has given the order, ‘Put the horses to it,’ and it has been announced, ‘They are,’ he goes to (the chariot, saying), ‘This is the Virâ_g_,’ and touches the two wheels, <span id="p364"><sup><small>[ p. 364 ]</small></sup></span>

3\. The right (wheel) with (the words), ‘The Rathantara art thou’—

4\. The left with (the words), ‘The B<i>ri</i>hat art thou’—

5\. The pole with (the words), ‘The Vâmadevya art thou.’

6\. [^953]. He touches the interior of the chariot with his hand (saying), ‘The two Aṅkas, the two Nyaṅkas which are on both sides of the chariot, which move forward with the rushing wind, the far-darting one with keen senses, the winged one, may these fires, the promoters, promote us.’

7\. [^954]. With (the words), ‘Adoration to Mâ<i>n</i>i<i>n</i>ara,’ he drives on the beast on the right side.

8\. (If going in his chariot) toward (images of) gods, let him descend (from the chariot) before he has reached them; if toward Brâhma<i>n</i>as, just before (reaching them); if toward cows, when amid them; if toward fathers, when he has reached them.

9\. A woman or a Vedic student shall not be charioteers. <span id="p365"><sup><small>[ p. 365 ]</small></sup></span>

10\. Having driven a moment beyond (the point to which he intends to go) he should murmur, ‘Here is rest, rest here’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. VIII, 51).

11\. [^955]. Some add (the words), ‘Here shall be no rest.’

12\. If the chariot is weak, he should murmur, after he has mounted it, ‘May this your chariot, O A<i>s</i>vins, suffer no damage on bad ways or by being overthrown.’

13\. [^956]. If the horses run away with the chariot, he should touch the post (?) or the earth and should murmur, ‘May this your chariot, O A<i>s</i>vins, suffer no damage on bad ways or by being overthrown.’

14\. Thus he will suffer no harm and no damage.

15\. [^957]. When he has finished his way, and has unyoked the horses, let him have grass and water given to them. ‘For thus satisfaction is given to the beast that draws (the cart)’—says the <i>S</i>ruti.

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 15.

1\. Now how he should mount an elephant.

2\. He goes to the elephant and touches it (saying), ‘The elephants’ glory art thou. The elephants’ honour art thou.’

3\. He then mounts it with (the words), 'With Indra's thunder-bolt I bestride thee. Make me arrive safely.’

4\. Thereby it has also been declared how he should mount a horse. <span id="p366"><sup><small>[ p. 366 ]</small></sup></span>

5\. When he is going to mount a camel, he addresses it: ‘Thou art the son of Tvash<i>t</i>_ri_; Tvash<i>t</i>_ri_ is thy deity. Make me arrive safely.’

6\. [^958]. When he is going to mount a he-ass, he addresses it: ‘A <i>S</i>ûdra art thou, a <i>S</i>ûdra by birth. To Agni thou belongest, with twofold sperm. Make me arrive safely.’

7\. A path he addresses: ‘Adoration to Rudra who dwells on the paths. Make me arrive safely.’

8\. A cross-road he addresses: ‘Adoration to Rudra who dwells at the cross-roads. Make me arrive safely.’

9\. When he intends to swim across a river, he addresses it: ‘Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the waters. Make me arrive safely.’

10\. When going on board a ship, he addresses her: ‘The good ship’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXI, 7).

11\. When going to cross (the river), he addresses (the ship): ‘The well-protecting’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXI, 6).

12\. A forest (through which he is wandering) he addresses: ‘Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the forests. Make me arrive safely.’

13\. A mountain (which he is going to cross) he addresses: ‘Adoration to Rudra who dwells on the mountains. Make me arrive <i>s</i>afely.’

14\. A burial-ground he addresses: ‘Adoration to Rudra who dwells among the Fathers. Make me arrive safely.’

15\. A cow-stable he addresses: ‘Adoration to Rudra who dwells among the dung-heaps. Make me arrive safely.’ <span id="p367"><sup><small>[ p. 367 ]</small></sup></span>

16\. And wheresoever else it be, let him always say, ‘Adoration to Rudra.’ For the <i>S</i>ruti says, ‘Rudra is this universe.’

17\. If the skirt (of his garment) is blown upon him (by the wind), he addresses (that skirt): ‘A skirt art thou. Thou art not a thunder-bolt. Adoration be to thee. Do no harm to me!’

18\. The thunder he addresses: 'May the rains be friendly to us; may (Indra's) darts be friendly to us—may they be friendly to us which thou throwest, O killer of V<i>ri</i>tra.’

19\. [^959]. A howling jackal he addresses: ‘Friendly by name’ (Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. III, 63).

20\. [^960]. A shrieking bird he addresses: ‘Golden-winged bird who goest where the gods send thee! Messenger of Yama, adoration be to thee! What has the Kârkâri<i>n</i>a told thee?’

21\. A tree that serves as a mark (of a boundary, &c.), he addresses: ‘May neither the flash of lightning (destroy thee), nor axe nor wind nor punishment which the king sends. May thy shoots grow up; may rain fall on thee, in safety from the wind. May fire not destroy thy root. Blessing on thee, O lord of the forest! Blessing on me, O lord of the forest!’

22\. If he receives something (given to him), he accepts it with (the formula), ‘May Heaven give thee; may the Earth accept thee.’ Thus (the thing given) does not decrease to him who gives it, and what he receives increases. <span id="p368"><sup><small>[ p. 368 ]</small></sup></span>

23\. If boiled rice is given to him, he accepts it with (the formula), ‘May Heaven, &c.,’ and he partakes thereof twice. with (the formulas), ‘May Brahman eat thee!’—‘May Brahman partake of thee!’

24\. If gruel is given to him, (as above) . . . . three times with (the formulas), ‘May Brahman eat thee! ’—‘May Brahman partake of thee!’—'May Brahman drink thee!

## KA<i>ND</i>IKÂ 16.

1\. [^961]. Now each time after a lesson (of the Veda) is finished, in order to prevent his forgetting (the texts he has studied, the following prayer should be recited):

May my mouth be skilful; my tongue be honey-sweet speech. With my ears I have heard much; do not take away that which I have heard, which dwells in me.

The Brahman's word art thou; the Brahman's stand art thou; the Brahman's store-house art thou. Fulfilment art thou; peace art thou; unforgetfulness art thou; enter into my store-house of the Brahman. With the voice I cover thee! With the voice I cover thee! May I be able to form the vowels, to produce, to hold fast and to utter the guttural, pectoral, dental, and labial sounds. May my limbs grow strong, my voice, breath, eye, ear, honour, and power. What I have heard and studied, may that be fixed in my mind; may that be fixed in my mind.’

End of the Third Kâ<i>nd</i>a.

End of Pâraskara's G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra.

## Footnotes

[^866]: 337:1 1, 1. The corresponding ceremony of the <i>S</i>rauta ritual is treated of in Kâty. IV, 6.

[^867]: 337:2 A fresh Sthâlîpâka means probably a Sthâlîpâka prepared from the fresh grain of the new harvest.

[^868]: 337:3 The deities of the Âgraya<i>n</i>a ceremony, which occupies in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual the place corresponding to the rite described here, are Indra and Agni, the Vi<i>n</i>ve devâs, Heaven and Earth.

[^869]: 338:5 The Annapatîya verse is Vâ_g_. Sa<i>m</i>h. XI, 83.

[^870]: 338:6 Comp. manâv adhi, Rig-veda VIII, 72, 2.

[^871]: 338:2 2, 2. The two oblations belonging to the _S<i>rava</i>n_â ceremony are those stated above, II, 14, 4. 5.

2\. The first verses in which the Âgrahâya<i>t</i>î night is called the consort of the year, or the image of the year, occur elsewhere with reference to the Ekâsh<i>t</i>akâ night. See Atharva-veda III, 10; Taitt. p. 339 Sa<i>t</i>hitâ V, 7, 2, 1. See also below, Pâraskara III, 3, 5. Sa<i>t</i>vatsara, Parivatsara, Idâvatsara, &c. are terms designating the different years of the quinquennial period of the Yuga. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 369, 370.

[^872]: 339:4 See above, II, 14, 1I-21 (not 19-21 as indicated by Professor Stenzler).

[^873]: 339:6 ‘Redescending’ means that they do not sleep any longer on high bedsteads, which they did from the _S<i>râvanî day till the Âgrahâya</i>n_î, on account of the danger from the snakes, but on the ground. See the notes on Sâṅkh.-G<i>râvanî day till the Âgrahâya</i>hya IV, 15, 22; 17, 1.

[^874]: 340:10-11 10, 11. See the note on § 6.

[^875]: 340:12 On upeta, which means a person for whom the Upanayana has been performed, see my note, <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 1, 1.

[^876]: 341:14 The verse occurs, with a few differences, in the Kâ<i>n</i>va <i>S</i>âkhâ of the Vâ_g_. Sa<i>n</i>hitâ, II, 7, 5.

[^877]: 341:1 3, 1. On the Ash<i>t</i>akâs, celebrated on the eighth days of the three dark fortnights following after the Âgrahâya<i>t</i>î full moon, see <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana III, 12 seqq.; Â<i>t</i>valâyana II, 4; Gobhila III, 10.

[^878]: 341:2 As there are four deities named, I think it probable that they are referred to all Ash<i>t</i>akâs indiscriminately; comp. Â<i>t</i>valâyana II, 4, 12. Thus in the Mantras prescribed for the first Ash<i>t</i>akâ (Sûtras 5 and 6), Indra, the Vi<i>t</i>ve devâs, and Pra<i>t</i>âpati are named; to the Fathers belongs the Anvash<i>t</i>akya ceremony.

[^879]: 341:3 With regard to the order of these substances the G<i>ri</i>hya texts differ.

[^880]: 341:5 Comp. Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>hitâ IV, 3, 11; Atharva-veda III, 10.

[^881]: 341:a (a) The thirty sisters seem to be the days of the month. As to p. 342 madhye<i>kh</i>andas, comp. Taitt. Sa<i>kh</i>h. loc. cit. § 1: _kh<i>kh</i>s_âne; § 2: _k<i>kh</i>t<i>kh</i>g_<i>kh</i>asya pakshâv <i>ri</i>shayo bhavantî, gâyatrî_m<i>kh</i>t<i>kh</i>m<i>kh</i>g<i>kh</i>t<i>kh</i>ri<i>kh</i>m<i>kh</i>ñ_<i>kh</i>ânâ<i>h</i> suvar âऽbharann idam.

[^882]: 342:d (d) Probably one Ash<i>t</i>akâ addresses the others, her sisters, as <i>G</i>ayarâma explains this verse.

[^883]: 342:f (f) The explanation by which the ‘fivefold milking’ is referred to what is called in Taitt. Brâhma<i>n</i>a II, 2, 9, ‘the milkings of Pra<i>n</i>âpati,’ seems to me more than doubtful, for ‘the milkings p. 342 of Pra<i>n</i>âpati’ are only four: viz. the dark night, the moonlight, the twilight, and the day.

[^884]: 343:i (i) Sukra-_ri_shabhâ cannot be translated, as Professor Stenzler does, ‘die schönste unter den Lichtern’ (Mâdhava: _s<i>ukreshu nakshatrâdishu </i>s<i>ukreshu nakshatrâdishu </i>th_â), for this meaning of <i>ri</i>shabhâ occurs only in later texts. The word is a Bahuvrîhi compound, as the Petersburg Dictionary explains it.

[^885]: 343:6 In the first verse I have omitted vya<i>s</i>navai, which impedes the construction and violates the metre. The word has found its way into the text, no doubt, in consequence of the phrase dîrgham âyur vya<i>s</i>navai occurring in chap. 2, 2. In the second verse p. 344 ak<i>s</i>tad is corrupt. I have translated abhayam; comp. Â<i>s</i>valâyana II, 4, 14. In the third verse I have left out mayi, as Professor Stenzler has done in his translation.

[^886]: 345:13 I have stated in the note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana III, 13, 1 my reasons for believing that the true reading of this Sûtra is not madhyâvarshe (in the middle of the rainy season), but mâghyavarshe (the festival celebrated during the rainy season under the Nakshatra Maghâs). There are no express rules given with regard to the third Ash<i>t</i>akâ, but I think we should understand this Sûtra as involving a statement on that Ash<i>t</i>akâ: (The third Ash<i>t</i>akâ) and the fourth, on the Mâghyavarsha day, are Sâkâsh<i>t</i>akâs (Ash<i>t</i>akâs on which vegetables are offered). <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana (G<i>t</i>hya III, 13, 1) declares that the ritual of the fourth Ash<i>t</i>akâ is identical with that of the second.

[^887]: 345:3 4, 3. Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 8, 15.

[^888]: 345:4 On gagadai_h<i> saha (in the third verse) see my note on </i>S_âṅkhâyana-G<i> saha (in the third verse) see my note on </i>hya III, 2, 9.

[^889]: 346:7 Rig-veda VII, 54; 55, 1.

[^890]: 347:a 8 a. Vâ<i>g</i>î is, as the name shows, the goddess of quick vigour. <i>G</i>ayarâma explains Vâ<i>g</i>î, a name of Sîtâ, as a personification of food.

[^891]: 347:b Comp. Â<i>s</i>valâyana II, I, 14. On <i>g</i>agada, comp. above, § 4.

[^892]: 349:18 Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 3, 7 seq.; chap. 4, 10. The comparison of Sâṅkhâyana shows that we have to divide saha pra<i>ri</i>ayâ pa<i>ri</i>ubhi_h_, saha yan me ki<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>id asty, upahûta_h_, &c. Sâdhusa<i>ri</i>v<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i> (if the reading is correct) seems to me to be the nom. plur. of sâdhusa<i>ri</i>v<i>ri</i>t. I understand this to be a Bahuvrîhi compound, in which sa<i>ri</i>v<i>ri</i>t means ‘the approaching.’ In Atharva-veda VII, 60, 4 we have sakhâya_h<i>ri</i>m<i>ri</i>h_. After <i>s</i>âle a verb meaning ‘I enter,’ or something like that, has been lost.

[^893]: 349:3 5, 3. Rig-veda X, 30, 12.

[^894]: 350:1 7, 1. Utûla-parimeha_h_. It is probable that utûla, as meaning a slave who habitually runs away, is connected with the use of that word as the name of a tribe in the north-west of India.

[^895]: 351:7\_3 Ukhâ yâbhyâ_m<i> g</i>ri<i> g</i>n_<i> g</i>vau. Comm. on Kâtyâyana, <i>S</i>raut. XVI, 4, 2.

In the Mantra I propose to read, pari tvâ hvalano, &c. Niv<i>ri</i>ttendravîrudha<i>h</i> seems to be corrupt; it seems to be a compound of niv<i>ri</i>tta, a second member which is doubtful, and vîrudh (the plant). The meaning may have been ‘giving it up to consume the plants.’

[^896]: 351:4 This Sûtra is word for word identical with chap. 6, 4.

[^897]: 351:1 8, 1. Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 8.

[^898]: 351:2 Â<i>s</i>valâyana, loc. cit. § 35.

[^899]: 351:8\_3 The ‘outspreading’ is the establishing of the three sacred <i>S</i>rauta fires, so that the G<i>ri</i>hya fire is considered as the Gârhapatya, and the Âhavanîya and Dakshi<i>ri</i>âgni are taken from it.

[^900]: 352:5 On account of the designation of the sacrifice as <i>s</i>ûla-gava.

[^901]: 352:6 Â<i>s</i>valâyana, loc. cit. § 19.

[^902]: 352:9 <i>G</i>ayarâma: di<i>s</i>â_m<i>s</i>n<i>s</i>m<i>s</i>s<i>s</i>h_. ta_k<i>s</i>k_a vasayâ bhavati yathâgnishomîye.

[^914]: 354:7 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, § 15. There is no Mantra in the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi Sa<i>g</i>hitâ beginning with the word mayobhû_h_, but this word occurs in the middle of XVIII, 45 a; the texts which he recites begin at that word and extend down to the end of the Anuvâka. It is clear that mayobhû<i>h</i> was intended in the original text, from which both <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana and Pâraskara have taken this Sûtra, as the _Ri_k-Pratika, Rig-veda X, 169, 1.

[^944]: 361:10-11 10, 11. The way for interpreting these Sûtras is shown by Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 12. I do not think that they have anything to do, as <i>G</i>ayarâma states, with reference to Sûtra II, with the offering due to a relative who has died while being absent on a journey (chap. 10, 44).

[^945]: 361:1 12, 1. See the parallel passages quoted by Professor Bühler in his note on Âpastamba I, 26, 8 (S.B.E., II, 85), and besides, Kâtyâyana I, I, 13 seqq.; Gautama XXIII, 17 seqq., &c.

[^950]: 362:2 13, 2. The regular Sandhi would be sabha (for sabhe) âṅgirasi, instead of which the text has sabhâṅgirasi.

[^951]: 362:3 In Sanskrit the words sabha (court) and samiti (assembly) are of feminine gender. I have translated upa ma sa tish<i>th</i>et in the sense indicated by Pâ<i>th</i>ini I, 4, 87.

[^952]: 363:5 Perhaps we should read garbhe<i>n</i>â<i>n</i>vataryâ<i>h</i> saha: we take away thy anger together with the offspring of the she-mule (that cannot foal). Comp. <i>K</i>ullavagga VII, 2, 5; S.B.E., XX, 238.

[^953]: 363:6 It is impossible to give a sure restoration of this corrupt Mantra. Perhaps we should read something like this: â te vâ<i>k</i>am âsya â te h<i>k</i>daya âdade. Comp. Hira<i>k</i>y.-G<i>k</i>hya I, 4, 15, 6.

[^954]: 364:6 14, 6. The meaning of aṅkau and nyaṅkau cannot be determined, as far as I can see. The commentators explain the words as the two wheels and the two sides of the chariot, or as the two right wheels and the two left wheels of a four-wheeled chariot. Professor Zimmer (Altindisches Leben, pp. 251 seq.) compares aṅka with ἄντυξ, and says, ‘Mit aṅkau (resp. aṅkû) ware daher die obere Einfassung des Wagenkastens (ko<i>s</i>a, vandhura) bezeichnet, mit nyaṅkau (resp. nyaṅkû) ein zu grösserer Befestigung etwas weiter unten (ni) herumlaufender Stab.’ To me it seems that aṅkau and nyaṅkau are to be understood both as designations of certain parts of the chariot and as names of different forms of Agni dwelling in the chariot.—Comp. Taittirîya Sa<i>s</i>hitâ I, 7, 7, 2; Pa<i>s</i><i>s</i>avi<i>s</i><i>s</i>a Brâhma<i>s</i>a I, 7, 5.

[^955]: 364:7 The name of the demon Mâ<i>n</i>i<i>n</i>ara occurs, as far as I know, only here.

[^956]: 365:11 If the reading of the text is correct, the meaning would seem to be: We will rest here for a while, but then we will go further.

[^957]: 365:13 I cannot say what ‘the post’ (stambha) here means; it may be apart of the chariot. _G<i>ayarâma has dhva</i>g_astambha, i.e. the staff of a flag, which we are to suppose was carried on the chariot. This may be the right explanation.

[^958]: 365:15 <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 8, 2, 9.

[^959]: 366:6 The he-ass has twofold sperm, because he begets both asses and mules. Taittirîya Sa<i>m</i>hitâ VII, 1, 1, 2.

[^960]: 367:19 The play on words is untranslatable; ‘jackal’ is <i>s</i>ivâ, ‘friendly,’ _s<i>iva</i>h_.

[^961]: 367:20 I do not know the meaning of kârkâri<i>n</i>a_h_. <i>G</i>ayarâma takes it for a genitive standing instead of an accusative, and explains it by asmadbâdhakam.

[^962]: 368:1 16, 1. As to anirâkara<i>n</i>a, comp. anirâkarish<i>n</i>u above, II, 4, 3. Possibly we should read, _g<i>n</i>k<i>n</i>h_.
