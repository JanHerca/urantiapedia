## PRAPÂ_TH_AKA III, KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 1.

1\. [^259] Now (follows) the Godâna ceremony (or cutting of the beard), in the sixteenth year.

2\. [^260] The cutting of the hair (and the beard) has been explained by the (description of the) _K<i>û</i>d<i>û</i>n_a (II, 9). <span id="p70">[<sup><small>p. 70</small></sup>]</span>

3\. [^261] The student has his hair (and beard) cut himself.

4\. He has all the hair of his body shaven.

5\. The sacrificial fee given by a Brâhma<i>n</i>a consists of an ox and a cow,

6\. That given by a Kshatriya, of a pair of horses,

7\. That given by a Vai<i>s</i>ya, of a pair of sheep.

8\. Or a cow (is given by persons) of all (castes).

9\. A goat (is given) to the person who catches up the hair.

10\. [^262] The Upanayana .(connected with the Godânavrata and the other Vratas) has been declared by the Upanayana (treated of above, II, 10).

11\. [^263] (The use of) a garment, however, which has not yet been washed, is not required (here),

12\. Nor the adornment.

13\. (One should) not initiate one who does not intend to keep the vow through one year.

14\. Handing over to him (i.e. to the student) a staff, which should be made of (the wood of) a tree, he directs him (to observe the duties connected with his vow, in the following words):

15\. 'Obey thy teacher, except in sinful conduct.

16\. 'Avoid anger and falsehood,

17\. 'Sexual intercourse,

18\. 'Sleeping on high (bedsteads),

21\. 'Combing the head, cleansing the teeth, washing the feet,

22\. 'Shaving,

23\. 'Eating honey and flesh,

24\. 'Mounting a chariot yoked with cattle,

25\. 'Wearing shoes in the village,

26\. ‘Svayam-indriya-mo<i>k</i>anam.’

27\. Wearing the girdle, going the rounds for alms, carrying a staff, putting fuel (on the fire), touching water, reverentially saluting (the teacher) in the morning: these are his standing duties.

28\. [^264] The Godâna-vrata, the Vrâtika-vrata, the Âditya-vrata, the Aupanishada-vrata, the _G<i>yaish</i>th_asâmika-vrata (last) one year (each).

29\. Touching water in the evening and in the morning (is prescribed) for these (Vratas).

30\. [^265] The Âditya-vrata, however, some do not undergo.

31\. They who undergo it, wear one garment.

32\. They allow nothing to be between (themselves and) the sun, except trees and (the roofs of) houses.

<span id="p72">[<sup><small>p. 72</small></sup>]</span>

## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 2.

1\. [^266] For the Mahânâmnî verses (the Vrata is to be kept) twelve years,

2\. (Or) nine, six, three (years).

3\. These are the various possibilities.

4\. Or also one year, according to some (teachers).

5\. (In this case), however, the observances are enhanced.

6\. (Keeping the Vrata through one year is allowed only) if (the student's) ancestors have learnt the Mahânâmnî verses.

7\. There is also a Brâhma<i>n</i>a of the Rauruki (_S_âkhâ, in which it is said):

8\. 'The mothers forsooth say to their sons, when they suckle them:

9\. ‘“Become men, my little sons, who endeavour to accomplish the _S_akvarî-vrata!”’

10\. [^267] During (the Vrata preparatory to the study of) these (i.e. the Mahânâmnî verses), touching water at the time of each Savana (is prescribed).

11\. Let him not eat in the morning before he has touched water.

12\. [^268] In the evening, after he has touched water, he should not eat, before he has put the piece of wood on the fire. <span id="p73">[<sup><small>p. 73</small></sup>]</span>

13\. He should wear dark clothes.

14\. He should eat dark food.

15\. Let him be devoted to his teacher.

16\. Let him make way for nobody.

17\. He should be addicted to austerities.

18\. He should stand in day-time.

19\. He should sit at night.

20\. And when it is raining, he should not retire to a covered place.

21\. He should say to (the god) when he sends rain, ‘The _S_akvarîs are water.’

22\. When (the god) sends lightning, he should say to him, ‘Such forsooth is the nature of the _S_akvarîs.’

23\. When (the god) thunders, he should say to him, ‘The great voice of the great (cow)!’

24\. Let him not cross a river without touching water.

25\. Let him not ascend a ship.

26\. If his life is in danger, however, he may ascend (a ship), after having touched water.

27\. In the same way (he should touch water) having disembarked.

28\. For in water the virtue of the Mahânâmnîs is contained.

29\. If he practises these duties, (the god) Par<i>g</i>anya will send rain according to his wish.

30\. [^269] The rules about dark (clothes), standing, sitting, (making) way, and (dark) food may be considered as optional.

31\. After he has kept his vow through one third (of the prescribed time, the teacher) should <span id="p74">[<sup><small>p. 74</small></sup>]</span> sing to him the (first) Stotriya verse (of the Mahânâmnîs).

32\. In the same way the two other Stotriya verses (after two-thirds of the time and at the end of the whole time).

33\. Or all (the three verses) at the end of the whole (time).

34\. He should sing them to (the student) who has fasted and shuts his eyes.

35\. [^270] Having filled a brass vessel with water, having thrown into it all sorts of herbs, and dipped (the student's) hands into it, the teacher should veil (the student's eyes) from left to right with a (new) garment that has not yet been washed.

36\. [^271] Or he should sing (the Mahânâmnîs to him) immediately after he has veiled (his eyes).

37\. [^272] With veiled eyes, keeping silence, he should abstain from food through a period of three nights, or through one day and one night.

38\. Or he should stand in the forest till sunset (and spend the night in the village).

39\. On the next morning he should put wood on the fire in the forest, should sacrifice with the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, and should cause the student to look at (the following objects, viz.)

40\. Fire, Â<i>g</i>ya, the sun, a Brahman, a bull, food, water, curds,

41\. With (the words), ‘The sky have I beheld! Light have I beheld!’ <span id="p75">[<sup><small>p. 75</small></sup>]</span>

42\. In that way all (the objects stated in Sûtra 40) three times.

43\. [^273] After the ceremony for averting evil has been performed, the student respectfully salutes the teacher.

44\. Thus he has to break the silence (enjoined upon him).

45\. [^274] A bull, a brass vessel, a garment, an optional gift (of a cow): this is the sacrificial fee.

46\. The first time he may choose (either a bull or a brass vessel).

47\. Let him provide his teacher with clothes, according to some (teachers).

48\. [^275] A mess of cooked food, sacred to Indra, (is prepared). Let him sacrifice of that (food) with this verse, ‘To the _Ri__k_, to the Sâman we sacrifice’ (Sâma-veda I, 369), or (with the verse), ‘The lord of the seat, the wonderful’ (ibid. I, 171), or with both (verses).

49\. [^276] This (he should do) at (all) the Anuprava<i>k</i>anîya ceremonies. <span id="p76">[<sup><small>p. 76</small></sup>]</span>

50\. [^277] The Mantra has to be altered everywhere (so that he has to say), ‘I have kept (the vow),’ ‘I have been able,’ ‘Thereby I have prospered,’ ‘I have undergone.’

51\. [^278] The fee to be given after the study of the Parvans is, a goat for the Agni-Parvan, a ram for the Indra-Parvan, a cow for the Pavamâna-Parvan.

52\. After (the student) has returned (from the forest), he should entertain his teacher and his retinue with food,

53\. And his fellow-students who have come together.

54\. The way to sing the _G<i>yesh</i>th_asâmans has been explained by (the statements given with regard to) the Mahânâmnî-(vrata).

55\. [^279] Here the following standing duties are to be observed:

56\. He should not have intercourse with a _S_ûdrâ woman.

57\. He should not eat bird's flesh.

58\. [^280] He should avoid (constantly living on) the same grain, and in the same place, and wearing one garment.

59\. He should perform the rite of ‘touching water’ with water drawn out (of a pond, &c.). <span id="p77">[<sup><small>p. 77</small></sup>]</span>

60\. [^281] From (the time of) his being directed (to observe the duties of his Vrata) he should not eat from an earthen vessel,

61\. Nor drink (from such a vessel),

62\. [^282] (Or rather) from (the time of) his being taught (the _G<i>yesh</i>th_asâmans, after the whole preparatory time, or after one third of that time), according to some (teachers).




## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 3.

2\. [^284] After (the teacher) has sacrificed with the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis, he recites the Sâvitrî to the students as at the Upanayana;

3\. And (he chants) the Sâvitrî with its Sâman melody, <span id="p78">[<sup><small>p. 78</small></sup>]</span>

4\. And (the Bârhaspatya Sâman, with the text), ‘Soma, the king, Varu<i>n</i>a’ (Sâma-veda I, 91).

12\. [^290] And both times water libations are offered to the Â<i>k</i>âryas.

13\. [^291] Some perform the Upâkara<i>n</i>a on the full-moon day of _S<i>n</i>n_a and wait (with studying) the time (from that day) till the day sacred to Savit<i>ri</i> (Sûtra 9).

4\. One who does not belong to the same Gotra,

5\. [^302] And who is not a Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>a relation of his mother.

6\. [^303] The best, however, is a ‘naked’ girl.

7\. [^304] Now the bath (which is taken at the end of studentship, will be described).

8\. To the north or the east of the teacher's house there is an enclosure.

9\. There the teacher sits down, facing the north, on eastward-pointed Darbha grass; <span id="p83">[<sup><small>p. 83</small></sup>]</span>

10\. Facing the east the student on northward-pointed Darbha grass.

11\. The teacher should besprinkle (him) with lukewarm, scented water, which has been boiled with all kinds of herbs.

12\. But as if he (i.e. the student, should do so) himself—

13\. [^305] (In such a way) he is alluded to in the Mantras; (therefore the besprinkling should be done rather by the student, and not by the teacher \[?\]).

14\. With (the verse), ‘The fires which dwell in the waters’ (MB. I, 7, 1)—(the student\[?\]) pours his joined hands full of water (on the ground),

15\. And again with (the formula), ‘What is dreadful in the waters, what is cruel in the waters, what is turbulent in the waters’ (ibid. 2).

16\. With (the formula), ‘The shining one I take here’ (ibid. 3)—he besprinkles himself.

17\. And again with (the formula), ‘For the sake of glory, of splendour’ (ibid. 4).

18\. And again with (the verse), ‘By which you made the wife (pregnant?’) (ibid. 5).

23\. With the verse, ‘Loosen the highest fetter, O Varu<i>n</i>a’ (ibid. 10), he takes off the girdle.

24\. After he has entertained the Brâhma<i>n</i>as with food and has eaten himself, he should have his hair, his beard, the hair of his body, and his nails cut, so as to leave the lock of hair (as required by the custom of his family).

25\. Having bathed and adorned himself, and having put on two garments (an under-garment and an upper-garment) which have not yet been washed, he should put a garland (on his head) with (the formula), ‘Luck art thou; take delight in me’ (ibid. 11).

26\. The two shoes (he puts on) with (the formula), ‘Leaders are you; lead me’ (ibid. 12).

27\. With (the formula), ‘The Gandharva art thou’ (ibid. 13), he takes a bamboo staff.

28\. He approaches the teacher together with the assembly (of his pupils) and looks at the assembly of his teacher's (pupils) with (the words), ‘Like an eye-ball may I be dear to you’ (ibid. 14).

29\. Sitting down near (the teacher) he touches the sense-organs at his head with (the verse), ‘The she-ichneumon, covered by the lips’ (ibid. 15).

30\. Here the teacher should honour him with the Argha ceremony.

31\. (The student then) should approach a chariot yoked with oxen, and should touch its two side-pieces or the two arms of the chariot-pole with <span id="p85">[<sup><small>p. 85</small></sup>]</span> (the verse), ‘O tree, may thy limbs be strong’ (ibid. 16).

32\. With (the last words of that verse), ‘May he who stands on thee, win what can be won’—he mounts it.

33\. Having driven (some distance) in an easterly or northerly direction, he turns round from left to right and comes back (to his teacher).

34\. [^307] When he has come back, the Argha ceremony should be performed (for him by his teacher), say the Kauhalîyas.



## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 5.

1\. [^308] From that time he shall assume a dignified demeanour: this is in short the rule (for his behaviour).

2\. Here the teachers enumerate the following (regulations).

3\. Nâ<i>g</i>âtalomnyopahâsam i<i>g</i><i>g</i>et.

17\. (He should not wear a wreath) of which the expression mâlâ (garland) has been used.

18\. He should cause the people to call it sra<i>g</i> (wreath). (Then he may wear it.)

19\. He should avoid using the word bhadra (‘blessed’) without a reason.

20\. [^309] He should say (instead of it), mandra (‘lovely’).

21\. [^310] There are three (kinds of) Snâtakas:

22\. A Vidyâsnâtaka (or a Snâtaka by knowledge), a Vratasnâtaka (or a Snâtaka by the completion of his vow), and a Vidyâvratasnâtaka (i.e. Snâtaka by both).

23\. Of these the last ranks foremost; the two others are equal (to each other).

24\. (A Snâtaka) should not put on a wet garment.

25\. [^311] He should not wear one garment.

26\. He should not praise any person (excessively).

27\. He should not speak of what he has not seen, as if he had seen it, <span id="p87">[<sup><small>p. 87</small></sup>]</span>

38\. [^313] And what (besides) is prescribed by _S<i>ish</i>t_as.




## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 6.

1\. [^314] When his cows are driven out, he should repeat (the verse), ‘May (Bhava), the all-valiant one, (and Indra protect) these (cows) for me’ (MB. I, 8, 1).

2\. When they have come back, (he should repeat the verse), ‘These which are rich in sweet’ (ibid. 2). <span id="p88">[<sup><small>p. 88</small></sup>]</span>

3\. If he is desirous of thriving (in his cattle), he should lick with his tongue the forehead of the firstborn calf, before it is licked by its mother, and should gulp with (the formula), ‘Thou art the phlegm of the cows’ (ibid. 3).

4\. If he is desirous of thriving (in his cattle), he should, when the cows have calved, at night put wood on the fire in the cow-stable and should sacrifice churned curds with drops of ghee, with (the verse), ‘Seizer, seize’ (ibid. 4).

5\. If he is desirous of thriving (in his cattle), he makes, when the cows have calved, with a sword of Udumbara wood, marks on a male and on a female calf, first on the male, then on the female, with (the Mantra), ‘The world art thou, thousandfold’ (ibid. 5. 6),

6\. And after he has done so, he should recite (over the two calves the Mantra), 'With metal, with the butcher's knife' (ibid. 7).

7\. When the rope (to which the calves are bound) is spread out, and (again) when the calves have been bound to it, he should recite over it (the verse), ‘This rope, the mother of the cows’ (ibid. 8).

8\. Here now the following (rites) have to be performed day by day, (viz.)

9\. [^315] (The rites at) the driving out (of the cows), at the coming back (of the cows), and at the setting into motion of the rope (with the calves).

10\. At the cow-sacrifice (i.e. the sacrifice by which a thriving condition for the cows is obtained), boiled rice-grains with milk (are offered). <span id="p89">[<sup><small>p. 89</small></sup>]</span>

11\. Let him sacrifice to Agni, Pûshan, Indra, and Î<i>s</i>vara.

12\. To the bull honour is done (by adorning it, by lavish food, &c.).

13\. By the cow-sacrifice also the horse-sacrifice (i.e. the sacrifice by which thriving horses are obtained) has been explained.

14\. Of deities Yama and Varu<i>n</i>a are added here (to the deities stated above) (Sûtra II).

15\. [^316] (After the cow-sacrifice) the cows are besprinkled with scented water; the cows are besprinkled with scented water.

8\. [^318] To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and husks (the grains), separating (the husked and the unhusked grains?).

9\. After he has carefully ground them to flour, and has thrown (that) into a wooden cup (_k_amasa), and covered it with a winnowing-basket, he puts it up (in the house).

10\. Between (the besmeared surface) towards the south, and that towards the east (there should be) a passage.

11\. [^319] After sunset he takes the wooden cup, (the spoon called) Darvi, and the winnowing-basket, and goes to (the fire) which has been carried forward (Sûtra 3).

12\. He throws the flour into the winnowing-basket and fills the wooden cup with water.

13\. He takes once a quantity of flour with the Darvi spoon, pours out water on the besmeared place to the east (of the fire), and offers (there) a Bali with (the words), ‘O king of Serpents, dwelling towards the east, this is thy Bali!’ (MB. II, 1, 1).

14\. He pours the rest of the water over (that Bali, taking care) that it does not carry away the Bali. <span id="p91">[<sup><small>p. 91</small></sup>]</span>

15\. [^320] Turning round from right to left, he besprinkles the wooden cup and the Darvi spoon, warms them, and (repeats the offering of a Bali) in the same way towards the south, towards the west, and towards the north, as the Mantra (MB. II, I, 1. 2) runs, without turning away (between the single Bali-offerings).

16\. [^321] After he has thrown the remnants (of flour) out of the basket into the fire, he goes to that fire which has not been carried forward.

17\. [^322] To the west of that fire he touches the earth with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the Mantra, ‘Adoration to the Earth’s’—(MB. II, 1, 3).

18\. In the evening boiled rice-grains with milk (are prepared).

19\. Of that (milk-rice) he should make oblations with (the formulas), ‘To _S<i>rava</i>n_a, to Vish<i>rava</i>u, to Agni, to Pra<i>rava</i>âpati, to the Vi<i>rava</i>ve devâs Svâhâ!’

20\. [^323] The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

21\. To the north of the fire he places a bunch of Darbha grass with roots, and murmurs the Mantra, ‘Soma the king’ (ibid. 4), and, ‘The agreement which you have made’ (ibid. 5). <span id="p92">[<sup><small>p. 92</small></sup>]</span>

22\. On the following day he has flour of fried barley-grains prepared, and in a new pot, covering (it with another pot), he puts it up (in his house).

23\. [^324] (Of that flour) he should silently offer Balis day by day in the evening, before the sacrifice, until the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î day.



## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 8.

1\. [^325] On the full-moon day of (the month) Â<i>vayu</i>vayu<i>vayu</i>a, at the P<i>vayu</i>shâtaka ceremony, a mess of boiled rice-grains with milk, sacred to Rudra, (is prepared).

2\. Of that (milk-rice) let him sacrifice, the first oblation with (the verse), ‘To us, O Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a’ (Sâma-veda I, 220), the second with (the verse), ‘Not in our offspring’ (<i>Ri</i>g-veda I, 114, 8),

3\. [^326] And (eight Â<i>g</i>ya oblations) with the 'cow's names' (i.e. with the formulas), ‘The lovely one art thou,’ &c., with each (name) separately.

4\. [^327] The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

5\. Having carried the P<i>ri</i>shâtaka around the fire, turning his right side towards (the fire), and having caused the Brâhma<i>ri</i>as to look at it (i.e. at the P<i>ri</i>shâtaka), he should look at it himself with (the verse <span id="p93">[<sup><small>p. 93</small></sup>]</span> repeated by the Brâhma<i>ri</i>as and by the-sacrificer), ‘That bright eye, created by the gods, which rises on the east—may we see it a hundred autumns; may we live a hundred autumns!’

6\. After he has entertained the Brâhma<i>n</i>as with food and has eaten himself, (the sacrificer and his family) should tie (to their arms, necks, &c.) amulets made of lac together with all sorts of herbs, for the sake of prosperity.

7\. In the evening he should feed the cows with the P<i>ri</i>shâtaka, and should let the calves join them.

8\. Thus (the cows) will thrive.

9\. [^328] At the sacrifice of the first fruits a mess of boiled rice-grains with milk, sacred to Indra and Agni, (is prepared).

10\. Having sacrificed first a Havis offering of that (milk-rice), he sacrifices over that (oblation) four Â<i>g</i>ya oblations with (the verses), ‘To him who bears a hundred weapons,’ &c. (MB. II, 1, 9-12).

11\. [^329] The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

12\. The rest of the remnants of the sacrificial food he should give to eat to all (persons present) who have received the initiation (Upanayana).

13\. Having ‘spread under’ water once, he should cut off two portions of the boiled rice-grains.

14\. Three (portions are cut off) by descendants of Bh<i>ri</i>gu.

15\. And over (these portions) water (is poured).

16\. [^330] (After the food has been prepared in this <span id="p94">[<sup><small>p. 94</small></sup>]</span> way), he should swallow it without chewing it, with (the Mantra), ‘From the good to the better’ (ibid. 13).

17\. In the same way three times.

18\. Silently a fourth time.

19\. After he has cut off a greater portion,

20\. They may, if they like, chew that.

21\. Having sipped water, they should touch their mouths, their heads, and their limbs from above downwards, with (the verse), ‘This art thou’ (ibid. 14).

22\. In the same way (sacrifices of the first fruits are performed) of _S_yâmâka (panicum frumentaceum) and of barley.

23\. (At the sacrifice) of _S_yâmâka (the Mantra with which the food is partaken of \[comp. Sûtra 16\], is), ‘May Agni eat as the first’ (ibid. 15).

24\. (At the sacrifice) of barley, ‘This barley, mixed with honey’ (ibid. 16).



## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 9.

1\. [^331] On the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î day (or the full-moon day of the month Mârga<i>s</i>îrsha) Bali-offerings (are made).

2\. [^332] They have been explained by the _S<i>râva</i>n_a sacrifice.

3\. [^333] He does not murmur (here) the Mantra, ‘Adoration to the Earth’s.’ <span id="p95">[<sup><small>p. 95</small></sup>]</span>

4\. In the morning, after he has sacrificed the (regular) morning oblation, he should have the following (plants and branches of trees) fetched, viz. Darbha grass, a _S_ami (branch), Vîri<i>n</i>a grass, a (Badarî branch) with fruits, Apâmârga, and _S_irîsha. He then should silently throw (a portion) of flour of fried barley into the fire, should cause the Brâhma<i>n</i>as to pronounce auspicious wishes, and should circumambulate the house, turning his right side towards it, starting from the room for the (sacred) fire, striking the smoke (of the sacred fire) with those objects (i.e. with the plants and branches mentioned above).

5\. He should throw away those objects, after he has made use of them.

6\. [^334] On solid stones he places a water-barrel with the two (Sâmans belonging to the verse), ‘Vâstoshpati’ (Sâma-veda I, 275) and with (that) _Ri_<i>k</i> (itself).

7\. Let him pour two pots of water into that barrel with this verse, ‘Some assemble’ (Sâma-veda-Âra<i>n</i>yaka, vol. ii, p. 292, ed. Bibl. Indica).

8\. [^335] In the evening boiled rice-grains with milk (are prepared).

9\. Of that (milk-rice) he should make an oblation with (the Mantra), ‘She shone forth as the first’ (MB. II, 2, 1).

10\. [^336] The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite. <span id="p96">[<sup><small>p. 96</small></sup>]</span>

11\. To the west of the fire he touches the Barhis with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis (i.e. the solemn utterances), ‘In the Kshatra I establish myself’ (ibid. 2. 3).

12\. To the west of the fire he should have a layer spread out,

13\. Of northward-pointed grass,

14\. Inclined towards the north.

15\. After they have spread out on that (grass) new rugs, the householder sits down (thereon) on the southern side.

16\. Then without an interval the others according to their age,

17\. And without an interval their wives, each with her children.

18\. When they are seated, the householder touches the layer (of grass) with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the verse, ‘Be soft to us, O Earth’ (ibid. 4).

19\. When he has finished that (verse), they lie down on their right sides.

20\. [^337] In the same way (they lie down on their right sides) three times, turning themselves towards themselves (i.e. turning round forwards, not backwards, and thus returning to their former position?).

21\. They repeat the auspicious hymns as far as they know them;

22\. [^338] The complex of Sâmans called Arish<i>t</i>a, according to some (teachers). <span id="p97">[<sup><small>p. 97</small></sup>]</span>

23\. Having touched water, they may do whatever they like.



## KÂ_N__D_IKÂ 10.

1\. [^339] The Ash<i>t</i>akâ (is a festival) sacred to the night.

2\. It procures prosperity.

3\. It is sacred to Agni, or to the Manes, or to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, or to the Seasons, or to the Vi<i>g</i>ve devâs—thus the deity (to which the Ash<i>g</i>akâ is sacred), is investigated (by different teachers).

4\. [^340] There are four Ash<i>t</i>akâs in (the four months of) the winter;

5\. These all he should endeavour to celebrate with (offerings of) meat;

6\. Thus says Kautsa.

7\. (There are only) three Ash<i>t</i>akâs (in the winter), says Audgâhamâni,

8\. And so say (also) Gautama and Vârkakha<i>n</i><i>n</i>i.

9\. The eighth day of the dark fortnight after the Âgrahâya<i>t</i>î is called Apûpâsh<i>t</i>akâ (i.e. Ash<i>t</i>akâ of the cakes).

10\. [^341] Having prepared grains in the way prescribed <span id="p98">[<sup><small>p. 98</small></sup>]</span> for Sthâlîpâkas, he cooks (those grains and prepares thus) a <i>k</i>aru.

11\. [^342] And (besides he prepares) eight cakes, without turning them over in the dish (in which he bakes them);

12\. (Each) in one dish;

13\. Without Mantras, according to Audgâhamâni;

14\. [^343] Of the size of the (cakes) sacred to Tryambaka.

15\. After he has baked them, he should pour (Â<i>g</i>ya) on them, should take them from the fire towards the north, and should pour (Â<i>g</i>ya) on them again.

16\. [^344] In the way prescribed for Sthâlîpâkas he cuts off (the prescribed portions) from the mess of boiled grains and from the cakes, and sacrifices with (the words), ‘To the Ash<i>t</i>akâ Svâhâ!’

17\. [^345] The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

18\. [^346] (At the second Ash<i>t</i>akâ, on) the eighth day after the full-moon day of Taisha, a cow (is sacrificed).

19\. Shortly before the time of junction (of day and night, i.e. before the morning twilight) he should place that (cow) to the east of the fire, and when (that time) has come, he should sacrifice (Â<i>g</i>ya) with <span id="p99">[<sup><small>p. 99</small></sup>]</span> (the verse), ‘What, O beasts, you think’ (MB. II, 2, 5).

20\. And after having sacrificed, he should recite over (the cow the verse), ‘May thy mother give leave to thee’ (ibid. 6).

21\. Let him sprinkle (the cow) with water in which barley is, with (the words), ‘Agreeable to the Ash<i>t</i>akâ I sprinkle thee.’

22\. Let him carry a fire-brand round it with (the verse), ‘The lord of goods, the sage (goes) round’ (Sâma-veda I, 30).

23\. Let him give it water to drink.

24\. The remainder of what it has drunk he should pour out under (the feet of) the beast with (the formula), ‘Away from the gods the Havis has been taken’ (MB. II, 2, 7).

25\. They then walk in a northerly direction (from the fire) and kill (the cow),

26\. The head of which is turned to the east, the feet to the north, if the rite is sacred to the gods,

27\. The head to the south, the feet to the west, if the rite is sacred to the Manes.

28\. After it has been killed, he should sacrifice (Â<i>g</i>ya) with (the verse), ‘If the beast has lowed’ (ibid. 8).

29\. And (the sacrificer's) wife should get water and should wash all the apertures of the cow's body.

30\. They lay two purifiers (i.e. grass-blades) on (the cow's body) near its navel, cut it up in the direction of its hairs, and draw the omentum out.

31\. He should spit it on two pieces of wood, on one (simple) branch and on another forked branch, should besprinkle it (with water), and should roast it. <span id="p100">[<sup><small>p. 100</small></sup>]</span>

32\. [^347] When it has ceased to drop, he should say, 'Hew the (cow) to pieces—

33\. ‘So that the blood does not stain the ground to the east of the fire.’

34\. After he has roasted (the omentum), he should pour (Â<i>g</i>ya) on it, should take it from the fire towards the north, and should pour (Â<i>g</i>ya) on it again.

35\. [^348] After he has cut off (the prescribed portions from) the omentum in the way prescribed for Sthâlîpâkas, or in the way prescribed for the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t (oblation), he sacrifices with (the words), ‘To the Ash<i>t</i>akâ Svâhâ!’

36\. [^349] The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite. The rest according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

End of the Third Prapâ<i>th</i>aka.

## Footnotes

[^259]: 69:1 1, 1. After the description of the regular Upanayana here follow, in chaps. 1 and 2, statements regarding the special Vratas which the Vedic student has to undergo, or rather which he may undergo, in the time of his studentship. Comp. the corresponding statements on the Vratas of the <i>Ri</i>gvedins, <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 11 and 12. By the followers of the Sâma-veda the ceremony of the Godâna, or cutting of the beard (comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 28, 19; Pâraskara II, 1, 7 seq.; Â<i>ri</i>valâyana I, 18), was put into connection with their system of Vratas; the undergoing of the Godânavrata enabled the student to study the Pûrvâr<i>ri</i>ika of the Sâma-veda. In the commentary on Gobhila III, 1, 28 we find the following statements with regard to this Vrata as well as to the other Vratas mentioned in Sûtra 28: 'The Upanayana-vrata has been declared to refer to the study of the Sâvitrî (comp. Bloomfield's notes on G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 42. 43); the Godâna-vrata, to the study of the collections of verses sacred to the gods Agni, Indra, and Soma Pavamâna (this is the Pûrvâr<i>ri</i>ika of the Sâma-veda); the Vrâtika-vrata, to the study of the Âra<i>ri</i>yaka, with the exclusion of the _S_ukriya sections; the Âditya-vrata, to the study of the _S_ukriya sections; the Aupanishada-vrata, to the study of the Upanishad-Brâhma<i>ri</i>a; the _G<i>ri</i>th_asâmika-vrata, to the study of the Â<i>ri</i>yadohas.' The Vratas were connected with a repetition of the Upanayana ceremony (Sûtras 10 seq.) in the way stated in my note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 12, 1.—Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 5, 1 seq.

[^260]: 69:2 Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 28, 19, ‘The Godânakarman is identical with the _K<i>û</i>d_âkarman.’ Pâraskara II, 1, 7, At the Ke<i>û</i>ânta ceremony he says, “Hair and beard” (instead of “hair,” as at the _K<i>û</i>d<i>û</i>n_a).’

[^261]: 70:3 At the _K<i>û</i>d<i>û</i>n_a the child sits in the mother's lap and others perform the rites for him.

[^262]: 70:10 See the note on Sûtra 1.

[^263]: 70:11 Comp. above, II, 10, 7.

[^264]: 71:28 The meaning of these expressions has been explained in the note on Sûtra 1.

[^265]: 71:30 According to the commentary some study the _S<i>ukriyas as a part of the Âra</i>n_yaka; these do not undergo the Âditya-vrata. Others, for instance the Kauthumas, separate the _S<i>ukriyas as a part of the Âra</i>n_yaka and keep a special vow, the Âditya-vrata, by which they are enabled to study those texts.

[^266]: 72:1 2, 1. Regarding the Mahânâmnî or _S_akvarî verses and the observances connected with their study, comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 12 (see especially the note on II, 12, 13) and the sixth Adhyâya of that text. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 5, 22 seq.

[^267]: 72:10 The rules as to ‘touching water’ have been given above, I, 2, 5 seq. The three Savanas or Soma-pressings of which the Soma sacrifice consists, are the prâta_h_\-savana, the mâdhyandina-savana, and the t<i>ri</i>tîya-savana, i.e. the morning Savana, the midday Savana, and the third or evening Savana.

[^268]: 72:12 Comp. above, II, 10, 46; III, I, 27.

[^269]: 73:30 See Sûtras 13. 18. 19. 16. 14.

[^270]: 74:35 Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya VI, 3, 7.

[^271]: 74:36 I.e. the fasting prescribed in Sûtras 34 and 37 may, if they like, follow after the teaching of the sacred song, instead of preceding it.

[^272]: 74:37 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 12, 6 seq.

[^273]: 75:43 Comp. above, I, 9, 29; <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana VI, 3, 11 seq.

[^274]: 75:45 45, 46. The student is to give a fee to his teacher three times, after he has been taught each of the three Stotriya verses (Sûtras 31. 32). To these three occasions the four objects stated in Sûtra 45 correspond, so that the first time either the first or the second of those objects, the bull or the brass vessel, may be chosen; the second time he gives a garment, the third time a vara (or optional gift). Comp. the similar correspondence of four objects and three cases to which these objects refer, II, 10, 8. 52.

[^275]: 75:48 This is the Anuprava<i>k</i>anîya ceremony (or ceremony to be performed after the study of a Vedic text has been finished) belonging to the Mahânâmnîs; comp. Khâdira-G<i>k</i>hya II, 5, 34; Â<i>k</i>valâyana-G<i>k</i>hya I, 22, 1 2; <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 8, 1 note.

[^276]: 75:49 Perhaps sarvatra (‘everywhere’) belongs to Sûtra 49, so that we should have to translate: This (should be done) everywhere at p. 76 the Anuprava<i>k</i>anîya ceremonies, i.e. also at those Anuprava<i>k</i>anîya ceremonies which are connected with the study of the other texts.

[^277]: 76:50 Instead of ‘I will keep the vow,’ he says, ‘I have kept the vow,’ &c.; II, 10, 16.

[^278]: 76:51 The Parvans are the three great sections, sacred to Agni, Indra, and Soma Pavâmana, into which the first Sâmavedâr<i>k</i>ika is divided.

[^279]: 76:55 According to the commentary he has to keep these observances through his whole life.

[^280]: 76:58 Or, wearing always the same garment?

[^281]: 77:60 Regarding the directions given to the student by the teacher, see chap. 1, 14.

[^282]: 77:62 See above, Sûtras 31. 33.

[^283]: 77:1 3, 1 seq. The Upâkara<i>n</i>a ceremony; Khâdira-G<i>n</i>hya III, 2, 16 seq. Regarding the different terms for this ceremony, comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 5, 2; Â<i>n</i>valâyana III, 5, 3; Pâraskara II, 10, 2. Hira<i>n</i>yake<i>n</i>in says: _s<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>g<i>n</i>n<i>n</i>m_ vâdhyâyopâkarma.—It seems impossible to me to adopt an explanation of this Sûtra, which gives to praush<i>n</i>apadî another meaning than that based on the constant use of these feminines derived from the names of Nakshatras, i.e. the day of the full moon which falls under such or such a Nakshatra. Hasten a, therefore, necessarily refers to another day besides the Praush<i>n</i>apadî, on which the Upâkara<i>n</i>a may be celebrated. Perhaps we may conjecture, praush<i>n</i>apadî_m<i>n</i>n_am.

[^284]: 77:2 Comp. above, II, 10, 39.

[^285]: 78:5 The _Kh_andas book is the first Sâmavedâr<i>k</i>ika in which the verses are arranged according to their metre.

[^286]: 78:6 It is not quite clear from the text, in what connection the rites described in Sûtras 6-8 stand with those treated of in the preceding Sûtras. The expression yathârtham used in Sûtra 5 (‘yathârtham iti karma<i>n</i>a_h<i>n</i>k_yate,’ Comm.; comp. above, I, 3, 12 note) clearly indicates the close of the ceremony; on the other hand the comparison of Pâraskara II, 10, 15 seq., <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 5, 10 seq., Â<i>n</i>valâyana III, 5, 10, seems to show that the acts stated in Sûtras 6-8 form part of the ceremony described before.

[^287]: 78:8 I do not try to translate this very obscure Sûtra according to the commentary, in which khâ<i>n</i><i>n</i>ika is explained as ‘the number (of pupils).’ Perhaps the word is a misspelling for ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>ikâ or the like, and means sections of the texts. Comp. Khâdira-G<i>n</i>hya III, 2, 23. The construction (â<i>n</i>ântodakâ<i>h</i> . . . kârayet) is quite irregular.

[^288]: 78:9 I.e. they do not continue their study. The day sacred to Savit<i>ri</i> is the day under the constellation of Hasta, mentioned in Sûtra 1, for Savit<i>ri</i> is the presiding deity over that Nakshatra (comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana I, 26, 11).

[^289]: 78:10 Comp. the note on Sûtra 16.

[^290]: 79:12 Regarding the Tarpa<i>n</i>a ceremony comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana 1V, 9, s note. From the word ‘and’ the commentator concludes that the libations are offered not only to the Â<i>n</i>âryas, but also to the _Ri_shis, &c. (Sûtra 15).

[^291]: 79:13 Comp. Gautama XVI, 1; Vasish<i>th</i>a XIII, 1; Âpastamba I, 9, 1, &c.

[^292]: 79:14 Âpastamba I, 9, 2, &c.

[^293]: 79:15 This is a description of the Utsarga ceremony; comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 6, 6; Â<i>s</i>valâyana III, 5, 21-23; Pâraskara II, 12.

[^294]: 79:16 The most natural way of interpreting the text would be, in my opinion, to assume that the ‘second Upâkara<i>n</i>a’ (pratyupâkara<i>n</i>a) is identical with the Utsarga. The second Upâkara<i>n</i>a thus would in the same time conclude the first term for studying the p. 80 Veda, and open a second term. The distinction of two such periods, which may be called two terms, is frequently met with in other texts, for instance, in Vasish<i>n</i>a XIII, 5-7 (S.B.E. XIV, 63); Manu IV, 98. According to the commentary, on the other hand, the second Upâkara<i>n</i>a is performed at the beginning of the northerly course of the sun (comp. Sûtras 10-12); it is stated that after that ceremony the Uttara (i.e. the Uttarâr<i>n</i>ika?) and the Rahasya texts are studied. It deserves to be noticed that Manu (IV, 96) prescribes the performing of the Utsarga either under the Nakshatra Pushya (i.e. Tishya), or on the first day of the bright fortnight of Mâgha, which is considered as coinciding, at least approximately, with the beginning of the northerly course of the sun.

[^295]: 80:18 Comp. Manu IV, 105.

[^296]: 80:22 These are the days of the ancient Vedic <i>k</i>âturmâsya sacrifices.

[^297]: 81:29 The definition of a _S<i>ish</i>t_a, or instructed person, is given in Baudhâyana I, 1, 6 (S.B.E. XIV, 143).

[^298]: 81:30 30-36. Different expiations; comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya II, 5, 35-37.

[^299]: 81:34 _K<i>itya means </i>K_itya agni, the piled-up fire-altar, the construction of which is treated of, for instance, in the _S_atapatha Brâhma<i>itya means </i>a VI-X. Prof. Weber has devoted to the rites connected with the <i>k</i>itya agni a very detailed paper, Indische Studien, XIII, 217 seq. That _k<i>itya means </i>k_itya agni is shown by the Mânava-G<i>itya means </i>hya I, 3: yadi . . . akshi vâ spandet kar<i>itya means </i>o vâ kro<i>itya means </i>ed agni_m<i>itya means </i>k<i>itya means </i>s<i>itya means </i>s<i>itya means </i>m<i>itya means </i>k_<i>itya means </i>ed yûpa_m<i>itya means </i>ri_<i>itya means </i>et, &c.

[^300]: 82:1 4, 1 seq. The description given in this chapter of the Samâvartana, or of the ceremony performed at the end of studentship, is opened with a few sentences referring to another section of the G<i>ri</i>hya ritual, namely, to marriage. It seems to me that these first Sûtras of this chapter once formed, in a text from which Gobhila has taken them, the introduction to an exposition of the wedding ceremonies, and that Gobhila was induced to transfer them to the description of the Samâvartana, by their opening words, ‘A student, after he has studied the Veda, &c.’ With Sûtras 1-3, comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 3, 1.

[^301]: 82:3 I prefer to supply, (with the permission) of his parents, and not, of his teacher. Hira<i>n</i>yake<i>n</i>in says, samâv<i>n</i>tta â<i>n</i>âryakulât mâtâpitarau bibh<i>n</i>yât, tâbhyâm anu<i>n</i><i>n</i>âto bhâryâm upaya<i>n</i><i>n</i>et.

[^302]: 82:5 Regarding the term Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>a, see, for instance, Gautama XIV, 13 (S.B.E. II, 247): ‘Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>a-relationship ceases with the fifth or the seventh (ancestor).’ Comp. Manu V, 60.

[^303]: 82:6 According to the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha (II, 1 7. 18), a ‘naked’ girl is one who has not yet the monthly period, or whose breast is not yet developed. Comp. Vasish<i>ri</i>a XVII, 70; Gautama XVIII, 23.

[^304]: 82:7 7 seqq. Comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 1, 1 seqq.

[^305]: 83:13 In the Mantras prescribed for the besprinkling of the student (Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 7, 1 seq.) there occur passages such as, for instance, ‘Therewith I, N.N., besprinkle myself.’

[^306]: 83:21 He may use the first section of the Mantra, which contains the word prâtar, in the morning, &c.

[^307]: 85:34 Instead of its being performed at the time stated in Sûtra 30.

[^308]: 85:1 5, 1 seq. Rules of conduct for the Snâtaka; comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya III, I, 33 seq.

[^309]: 86:20 As to the reading, comp. Dr. Knauer's remarks in his edition of the text, p. xi of the Introduction.

[^310]: 86:21 21, 22. These Sûtras are identical with Pâraskara II, 5, 32. Comp. the definitions of these three kinds of Snâtakas, Pâraskara, l.l. 33-35.

[^311]: 86:25 Comp. above, chap. 2, 58.

[^312]: 87:33 That the Snâtaka is not allowed to go alone to another village, follows from Sacra 36; thus Sûtra 33 is superfluous. The commentator of course tries to defend Gobhila, but I think he has not succeeded. Probably Gobhila has taken the two Sûtras from different texts on which his own composition seems to be based.

[^313]: 87:38 Baudhâyana I, 1, 6 (S.B.E. XIV, 144): ‘Those are called _S<i>ish</i>t_as who, in accordance with the sacred law, have studied the Veda together with its appendages, know how to draw inferences from that, and are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts.’

[^314]: 87:1 6, 1 seq. Different ceremonies connected with cattle-keeping. Comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya III, I, 45 seq.

[^317]: 89:1 7, 1 seq. The _S<i>rava</i>n_â ceremony or the Bali-offering to the Serpents. Comp. Khâdira-G<i>rava</i>hya III, 2, 1 seq., and the elaborate paper of Dr. Winternitz, Der Sarpabali, ein altindischer Schlangencult (Wien, 1888).

[^318]: 90:8 As to avahanti, comp. above, I, 7, 4; Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 30.

[^319]: 90:11 According to the commentary atipra<i>n</i>îta means the fire which has been carried forward (Sûtra 3). Another explanation is then added, which is based on a quotation from a ‘tantrântara:’ ‘After he has established a fire, he should carry forward one firebrand taken from that fire, in a south-eastern direction, with the Mantra ye rûpâ<i>n</i>i pratimu<i>n</i><i>n</i>amânâ<i>h</i> &c.; that fire is the atipra<i>n</i>îta fire.’

[^320]: 91:15 Literally, ‘turning round, following his left arm.’ Comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 3, 2. The Mantra runs thus, ‘O king of Serpents, dwelling towards the south (the west, the north), this is thy Bali!’

[^321]: 91:16 Comp. Sûtra 11 and the note.

[^322]: 91:17 Comp. below, IV, 5, 3.

[^323]: 91:20 G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha I, 114: ‘Where the technical expression is used, “The rest according to the rite of the Sthâlîpâkas,” he should, after he has sacrificed the two Â<i>ri</i>yabhâgas, pour (Â<i>ri</i>ya) into the Sru<i>k</i> and cut off (the Avadânas with the Sru<i>k</i>).’ Comp. Gobhila I, 8, 3 seq.

[^324]: 92:23 The sacrifice is that prescribed in Sûtras 18. 19, which should, as well as the offering of Balis, be daily repeated.

[^325]: 92:1 8, 1 seq. The P<i>ri</i>shâtaka ceremony; comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 3, 1 seq. A P<i>ri</i>shâtaka is a mixture of milk or of curds with Â<i>ri</i>ya; comp. Khâd. l.l. 3; G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 59; <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana IV, 16, 3 note.

[^326]: 92:3 The 'cow's names' are given in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha II, 60; of the nine names given there the last is omitted at the P<i>ri</i>shâtaka ceremony.

[^327]: 92:4 See above, chap. 7, 20 and the note.

[^332]: 94:2 See above, chap. 7.

[^333]: 94:3 Comp. chap. 7, 17: To the west of that fire he touches the p. 95 earth with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the Mantra, ‘Adoration to the Earth’s.’

[^334]: 95:6 He sings the two Kâvasha Sâmans of which the verse Sâma-veda I, 275 is considered as the Yoni, and then repeats that verse itself.

[^335]: 95:8 This Sûtra is identical with chap. 7, 18.

[^336]: 95:10 Comp. chap. 7, 20 note.

[^337]: 96:20 The explanation which the commentary gives of this difficult Sutra can hardly be accepted: trir âv<i>ri</i>tya tri<i>ri</i>k<i>ri</i>tvoऽbhyasya . . . abhyâtmam âtmano g<i>ri</i>hapater âbhimukhyena, âtmana ârabhyety artha_h_. katha<i>m</i> nâma? yenaiva krame<i>ri</i>opavish<i>ri</i>â_h<i>ri</i>n<i>ri</i>m<i>ri</i>s<i>ri</i>m<i>ri</i>h_.

[^338]: 96:22 The commentary gives a second name for this Sâman p. 97 litany, arish<i>t</i>abhaṅga. Nârâya<i>t</i>a says: abodhy agnir (Sv. I, 73) mahi trî<i>t</i>âm (I, 192) iti dve tvâvata (I, 193) ityâdika_m<i>t</i>m<i>t</i>g_ya.

[^340]: 97:4 4, 7. As to the difference of opinion regarding the number of Ash<i>t</i>akâs, comp. Weber, Naxatra, second article, p. 337. Gobhila himself follows the opinion of Audgâhamâni, for he mentions only three Ash<i>t</i>akâs in the winter season, the first following after the Âgrahâya<i>t</i>î full moon (chap. 50, 9), the second after the Taishî (10, 18), and the third after the Mâghî (IV, 4, 17).

[^346]: 98:18 With the following paragraphs the <i>S</i>rauta rites of the animal sacrifice should be compared; see J. Schwab, Das altindische Thieropfer (Erlangen, 1886).

[^347]: 100:32 In the text we ought to read vi<i>s</i>asata, as Dr. Knauer has observed.

[^348]: 100:35 The regulations concerning the Avadânas are given for Sthâlîpâkas, I, 8, 5 seq., and for the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t oblation, I, 8, 11 seq.
