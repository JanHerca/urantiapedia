## ADHYÂYA I, KHA<i>ND</i>A

[^12].

1\. [^12]. Now henceforth we shall declare the Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as.

2\. [^13]. When (a pupil) is going to return (from his teacher), let him keep that fire (as his domestic fire) on which he has put the last piece of wood (as required by the regulations for a student),

3\. Or (he should keep) his nuptial fire. <span id="p13">[<sup><small>p. 13</small></sup>]</span>

4\. Some declare (that the domestic fire should be kindled) at the time of the division of the inheritance.

5\. [^14]. Or that after the death of the householder the eldest one himself (should kindle it).

6\. (It should be kindled) on the day of the new moon of the month of Vai<i>s</i>âkha or on another (new moon day).

7\. Some say (that the fire should be kindled) according to the (sacrificer's) wishes under the (corresponding) constellation.

8\. [^15]. He should light his fire at one of the following places, viz. in the house of a Vai<i>s</i>ya who is rich in <span id="p14">[<sup><small>p. 14</small></sup>]</span> cattle, at a frying-pan, or (at the fire of) one who offers many sacrifices.

9\. [^16]. Some say that (the fire should be fetched from one of the above-mentioned places) in the evening and in the morning.

10\. The inauguration (of the fire) by an evening offering should be learnt from the Adhvaryus, according to (my) teacher.

11\. In the morning he shall offer a full oblation with a verse sacred to Vish<i>n</i>u, or silently.

12\. [^17]. The time for setting it (i.e. the domestic fire) in a blaze and for sacrificing on it has been explained by (the rules given with regard to) the Agnihotra. <span id="p15">[<sup><small>p. 15</small></sup>]</span>

13 [^18]. And ‘invested with the sacrificial cord,’ &c., all these rules, as far as they are applicable, should be applied (here also) in consequence of the unity of the ritual.

14\. With regard to this they quote also (the following <i>S</i>loka):

15\. [^19]. 'The kinds of Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as, the kinds of Havirya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as, and again the kinds of Soma sacrifices,

‘Twenty-one by number, these are proclaimed to be the kinds of sacrifice.’

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 2.

1\. At the end of the sacrificial acts (follows) the distribution of food to Brâhma<i>n</i>as.

2\. Voice, (pleasantness of) form, age, learning, moral character, (right) conduct are the qualities (required in the Brâhma<i>n</i>as who are to be invited thereto). <span id="p16">[<sup><small>p. 16</small></sup>]</span>

3\. Learning, however, outweighs every (other qualification).

4\. A learned one should not be passed over.

5\. 'The threefold (knowledge, viz. that) which refers to the deities, that which refers to the Âtman, and that which refers to sacrifice,

‘(Handed down) in the Mantras and in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a: this is called learning.

6\. 'A performer of the sacred rights, a man who has studied (the Veda), who is old in learning and devoted to austerities:

‘He who gives food (even) once to such (a Brâhma<i>n</i>a), hunger will not befall that man any more.

7\. 'Whatsoever deity he may wish to satiate at any sacrifice,

‘Destining it to that (deity) in his mind, he shall give (the food) to a person like that.

8\. 'An oblation deposited in a person like that will never miss its way to the deity;

‘Treasure of men, vessel of gods (in which they receive what is given to them) he is called.’





## KHA<i>ND</i>A 3.

1\. [^20]. Now (follow) the ceremonies of the days of the new and full moon.

He fasts.

2\. [^21]. In the morning, when the sun shines on the <span id="p17">[<sup><small>p. 17</small></sup>]</span> top of the great trees, that is the most auspicious time for all kinds of sacrifices, unless there be a special rule.

3\. [^22]. With a genial mind, clean, on a pure, protected spot, having cooked a full, thin mess of rice, he offers that cooked oblation to the deities of the festivals of the new and full moon, distributing it in the due way.

4\. [^23]. In the oblations of cooked food the acts of taking (the intended oblation), of putting it down (near the fire), and of sprinkling it (with water) are performed with regard to the deities of the (respective) Mantras. <span id="p18">[<sup><small>p. 18</small></sup>]</span>

5 [^24]. And the rules about the portions to be cut off (from the sacrificial food, are valid).

6\. [^25]. But before the sacrifices of the new and full moon one should make offerings to the deities of the Anvârambha<i>n</i>îya ceremony.

7\. [^26]. The time for the new moon sacrifice is not elapsed until the full moon, nor that for the full moon sacrifice until the new moon.

8\. [^27]. And some say that the morning oblation may be made at the time of the evening oblation, in the case of danger.

9\. But the time is fixed, as at the Agnihotra an expiation has been prescribed for him who has neglected the time.

10\. At the two daily oblations one should use as sacrificial food either rice or barley or grains.

11\. In case these are not at hand, other (sorts of sacrificial food are) not prohibited.

12\. Some say that if he uses grains, he should wash them.

13\. With the other (kinds of food) no such preparation takes place. <span id="p19">[<sup><small>p. 19</small></sup>]</span>

14 [^28]. In the evening (he makes the oblation) to Agni, in the morning to Sûrya,

15\. And after both silently to Pra<i>g</i>âpati.

16\. Some (say that) before the first oblation a piece of wood (is to be put on the fire).

17\. [^29]. The sprinkling with water as indicated (in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra).

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 4.

1\. [^30]. When he has risen in the morning and has sipped water, let him daily repeat his recital.

2\. (This consists of, or is accompanied by, the following texts:) the two verses, ‘To-day, god Savitar’ (Rig-veda V, 82, 4-5); the hymn, ‘Go away, Manasaspati’ (X, 164); the hymn, ‘Right and truth’ (X, 190); the verses, ‘Look down, ye Âdityas,’ to the end of the hymn (VIII, 47, 11-18); <span id="p20">[<sup><small>p. 20</small></sup>]</span> the verse, ‘O Indra, the best treasures’ (II, 21, 6); the verse, ‘The swan dwelling in purity’ (IV, 40, 5); the verse, ‘Adoration to the great ones’ (I, 27, 13); the verse, ‘What we fear, Indra’ (VIII, 50, 13); the verse, ‘And of the sleep’ (I, 120, 12); the verse, ‘He who says to me, O king’ (II, 28, 10); the hymn, ‘Let glory be mine, Agni’ (X, 128); and the five verses,‘ Bliss may create for us’ (V, 51, 11 seq.).

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 5.

1\. [^31]. There are four kinds of Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as, viz. the HUTA, the AHUTA, the PRAHUTA, and the PRÂ_S_ITA.

2\. [^32]. On the following five occasions, viz. the wedding, the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of the Brahma<i>k</i>ârin), the cutting of the beard, and the parting of the hair, (on these occasions) in the outer hall—

3\. [^33]. To a place that has been smeared (with cow-dung), which is elevated, and which has been sprinkled (with water), he carries forward the fire,

4\. Having kindled it by rubbing, according to some teachers, at his marriage.

5\. During the northern course of the sun, in the <span id="p21">[<sup><small>p. 21</small></sup>]</span> time of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day he shall seize the hand of a girl,

6\. Who should possess (the auspicious) characteristics (required),

7\. Whose limbs should be proportionate,

8\. Whose hair should be smooth,

9\. [^34]. Who should also have at her neck two curls turned to the right.

10\. (Of such a girl) he shall know that she will give birth to six men.


## KHA<i>ND</i>A 6.

1\. [^35]. If he will acquire a wife, let him recite over the wooers (whom he sends to the girl's father) when they go away, the verse, ‘Thornless’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 23).

2\. When they arrive, they take flowers, fruits, barley, and a pot of water.

3\. [^36]. They say thrice, ‘Here I am, sir!’

4\. When these words have been uttered, they ask the girl in marriage, reciting the clan names, the dwellers turning their faces to the east, the visitors to the west.

5\. When the matter pleases both sides, let them touch a full vessel into which have been put flowers, <span id="p22">[<sup><small>p. 22</small></sup>]</span> fried grain, fruits, barley, and gold, and let them recite (the formula), ‘Undisturbed art thou, the undisturbable vigour of the gods, not cursed, protecting against a curse, unexposed to a curse. Might I straightway attain to truth. Put me into prosperity.’

6\. [^37]. With the verse, ‘Offspring may produce us’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 43), the Â<i>k</i>ârya of the girl's (family), standing up, places (the vessel) on her head (saying), ‘Offspring I put into thee, cattle I put into thee, splendour and holy lustre I put into thee.’

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 7.

1\. [^38]. When assent has been declared (by the girl's father, the bridegroom) sacrifices.

2\. He besmears a quadrangular space with cow-dung.

3\. [^39]. (Let him consider in the ceremonies to be performed,) of the two eastern intermediate directions, the southern one as that to which (the rites) should be directed, if the rites belong to the Manes,

of the two eastern intermediate directions, sacred to Î<i>valâyana-</i>âna, should be considered as that to which the ceremonies sacred to the gods, such as oblations, &c., are to be directed.'—Comp. Â<i>valâyana-</i>valâyana-<i>S</i>raut. I, 12, 4.} <span id="p23">[<sup><small>p. 23</small></sup>]</span>

4\. The northern one, if the rites belong to the gods,

5\. Or rather the east (itself) according to some (teachers).

6\. [^40]. He draws in the middle (of the sacrificial ground) a line from south to north,

7\. Upwards from this, turned upwards, to the south one line, in the middle one, to the north one.

8\. These he sprinkles (with water),

9\. [^41]. Carries forward the fire with the verse, ‘I carry forward Agni with genial mind; may he be the assembler of goods. Do no harm to us, to the old nor to the young; be a saviour to us, to men and animals,’

10\. Or (he carries it forward) silently,

11\. Then he wipes with his wet hand three times around the fire, turning his right side to it. This they call SAMÛHANA (sweeping together). <span id="p24">[<sup><small>p. 24</small></sup>]</span>

12\. Once, turning his left side to it, in the rites belonging to the Manes.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 8.

1\. [^42]. Now (follows) the strewing (of grass) around (the fire).

2\. He strews eastward-pointed Ku<i>s</i>a grass around it, in three layers or in five layers,

3\. Beginning on the east side, then to the west, then to the west.

4\. He covers the roots (of the grass-blades) with the points.

5\. And all kinds of rites are to be performed beginning south, ending north.

6\. [^43]. He places the Brahman south with the words, BHÛR BHUVA_H_ SVA_H_,

7\. Adorns him with flowers,

8\. [^44]. Carries forward on the north side the Pra<i>n</i>îtâ waters with the words, ‘Who carries ye forward?’—

9\. [^45]. Takes up with the left hand the Ku<i>s</i>a blades, and arranges them (on the ground) with the right hand, <span id="p25">[<sup><small>p. 25</small></sup>]</span>

10\. Bending his right knee,

11\. The left when worshipping the Manes.

12\. The strewing around (of the grass) is not necessary in the Â<i>g</i>ya offerings,

13\. [^46]. Nor in the standing offerings, according to Mâ<i>n</i><i>n</i>ûkeya.

14\. [^47]. He now measures off with the span (of his hand) two Ku<i>s</i>a blades, which are not unequal, with unbroken points, bearing no young shoots in them, and severs them (from their roots) with a Ku<i>s</i>a blade, saying, ‘Purifiers are ye.’

15\. There are two or three (of these Ku<i>s</i>a strainers).

16\. He holds them with their points to the east and sprinkles them (with water, saying), ‘Belonging to Vish<i>n</i>u.’

17\. With the two Ku<i>s</i>a blades he sprinkles (water) around the fire three times, keeping his right side turned towards it,

18\. [^48]. Takes up the Â<i>g</i>ya pot with the words, ‘Milk of the cows art thou;’

19\. [^49]. Puts it on the fire with the words, ‘For sap thee;’

20\. [^50]. Takes it from the fire towards the north with the words, ‘For juice thee;’

21\. [^51]. And holding the two (Ku<i>s</i>a) strainers with their points to the north, seizing them on both sides <span id="p26">[<sup><small>p. 26</small></sup>]</span> with his two thumbs and fourth fingers, he bends them down, the points upwards, and dips them into the Â<i>s</i>ya with the words,

‘By the impulse of Savitar I purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the rays of the good sun.’

22\. (This) preparation of the Â<i>g</i>ya (takes place) each time.

23\. Let him not offer (Â<i>g</i>ya) which has not been (thus) prepared.

24\. [^52]. Also the waters in the Sruva spoon (he purifies) with the words, ‘(By the impulse) of Savitar (I purify) you.’

25\. This (is called) the PRA_N_ÎTÂ and the PROKSHA_N_Î water.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 9.

1\. [^53]. The Sruva spoon (serves as) a vessel.

2\. According to the purpose the properties (of the different things to be used at each oblation) should be chosen.

3\. [^54]. Taking up Ku<i>s</i>a blades with the left, and the <span id="p27">[<sup><small>p. 27</small></sup>]</span> Sruva at its bottom with the right hand, with the words, ‘The hand of Vish<i>s</i>u art thou’—

4\. [^55]. He offers with the Sruva the Â<i>g</i>ya oblations.

5\. [^56]. Beginning from the north-west side of the fire he offers (the Â<i>g</i>ya) unintermittingly on the south side (of the fire) with (the verse), ‘Thou Agni art full of foresight’ (Rig-veda I, 31, 10).

6\. Beginning from the south-west side of the fire he unintermittingly offers on the north side with (the verse), ‘To whom these snowy mountains’ (Rig-veda X, 121, 4).

7\. To Agni belongs the northern Â<i>g</i>ya portion, to Soma the southern.

8\. [^57]. In the middle (are made) the other oblations,

9\. (With the words,) 'Agni is the begetter; may he give to me N.N. as my wife; svâhâ!

‘Soma is rich in wives; may he make me rich in wives by N.N.; svâhâ!

‘Pûshan is rich in kindred; may he make me rich in kindred by the father, the mother, the brothers of N.N.; svâhâ!’

10\. [^58]. At the Â<i>ya oblations the offering of the two Â</i>ya oblations the offering of the two Â<i>ya oblations the offering of the two Â</i>ya portions and of the Svish<i>ya oblations the offering of the two Â</i>ak<i>ya oblations the offering of the two Â</i>t oblation is not standing, <span id="p28">[<sup><small>p. 28</small></sup>]</span>

11 [^59]. Nor in the standing oblations, according to Mâ<i>ya oblations the offering of the two Â</i><i>ya oblations the offering of the two Â</i>ûkeya.

12\. [^60]. The place for the insertion is the interval between the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, the general expiation, and the oblation to Pra<i>ri</i>âpati. <span id="p29">[<sup><small>p. 29</small></sup>]</span>

13\. If the oblation consists in Â<i>ri</i>ya, let him seize the Ku<i>ri</i>a blades in his left hand with his right hand at their points and with the left at their roots, and let him wet their points (with Â<i>ri</i>ya) in the Sruva, the middle and the roots in the Â<i>ri</i>ya pot;

14\. In the oblations of cooked food, however, the points in the Sru_k_, the middle in the Sruva, the roots in the Â<i>g</i>ya pot.

15\. When he then has thrown them (into the fire) with the words, 'Agni's garment art thou,’

16\. And has put on (the fire) three pieces of wood,

17\. [^61]. (Water) is sprinkled round (the fire) as stated above.

18\. Oblations for which only the deities are indicated, but no texts prescribed, are to be made merely with the word SVÂHÂ, ‘To such and such a deity svâhâ! To such and such a deity svâhâ!’

19\. [^62]. The ritual (here) declared of the sacrifice (to <span id="p30">[<sup><small>p. 30</small></sup>]</span> be performed) when (the father's) assent (to give away his daughter) has been declared—

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 10.

1\. [^63]. Forms the standard for all sacrifices that procure happiness,

2\. And for all Â<i>g</i>ya offerings,

3\. [^64]. For the sacrifice of animals which are tied to a branch,

4\. [^65]. And for the offerings of boiled (rice) grains and of cooked food.

5\. [^66]. These are performed, all the offerings of cooked food, without PRAYÂ_G_A and ANUYÂ_G_A oblations, without (the invocation of) the I_L_Â, without NIGADA recitation, and without SÂMIDHENÎ verses.

6\. There are also the following <i>S</i>lokas: <span id="p31">[<sup><small>p. 31</small></sup>]</span>

7 [^67]. '(An oblation is called) HUTA, (if made) by the performing of the Agnihotra; AHUTA (i.e. unsacrificed, if) by the Bali offering; PRAHUTA (i.e. sacrificed up, if) by a sacrifice to the Manes; PRÂ_S_ITA (i.e. tasted, if) deposited as an offering in a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.

8\. [^68]. 'Without raising his knees, with spread knees let him always offer his oblation; for the gods never accept an offering (that has been made holding the hand) not between (the knees).

9\. [^69]. ‘But when he has repeated a text sacred to Rudra, to the Rakshas, to the Manes, to the Asuras, or that contains an imprecation, let him touch water, and so also when he has touched his own body.’

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 11.

1\. [^70]. Now when the bride is to be carried away (to the bridegroom's house) that night, or on the next, or on the third night,

2\. [^71]. On that night, when (the darkness of) night is gone, they wash the girl up to her head with (water that has been made fragrant by) all sorts of herbs and the choicest fruits together with scents; <span id="p32">[<sup><small>p. 32</small></sup>]</span>

3\. They put on her a newly-dyed garment or (a new one) which has not yet been washed;

4\. [^72]. Then (the Â<i>ri</i>ârya of the bride's family) makes the girl sit down behind the fire, and while she takes hold of him he sacrifices with the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, and then he makes Â<i>ri</i>ya oblations to Agni, to Soma, to Pra<i>ri</i>âpati, to Mitra, to Varu<i>ri</i>a, to Indra, to Indrâ<i>ri</i>î, to the Gandharva, to Bhaga, to Pûshan, to Tvash<i>ri</i>ar, to B<i>ri</i>haspati, to the king Pratyânîka.

5\. After they have regaled four or eight women, who are not widows, with lumps of vegetables, Surâ, and food, these should perform a dance four times.

6\. The same deities (they worship also) on behalf of the man,

7\. And Vai<i>s</i>rava<i>s</i>a and Î<i>s</i>âna.

8\. Then follows the distribution of food to Brâhma<i>n</i>as.

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 12.

1\. The bridegroom, who has bathed and for whom auspicious ceremonies have been performed, is escorted by happy young women, who are not widows, to the girl's house.

2\. To these he shall not behave unobsequiously, except where forbidden food or a transgression is concerned.

3\. Having obtained their permission, he then gives her the garment with (the verse), ‘The Raibhî was’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 6). <span id="p33">[<sup><small>p. 33</small></sup>]</span>

4\. With (the verse), ‘Mind was the cushion’ (ibid. 7) he takes up the salve-box.

5\. [^73]. The verse for the Anointing is, ‘May the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs anoint (or, unite),’ (ibid. 47.)

6\. [^74]. ‘As this (has protected) _S<i>a</i>k_î the beloved one, and Aditi the mother of noble sons, and Apâlâ who was free from widowhood, nay it thus here protect thee, N.N.!’—with these words (the. bridegroom) gives her into her right hand the quill of a porcupine (and) a string of three twisted threads,

7\. With the verse, ‘Shape by shape’ (Rig-veda VI, 47, 18) a mirror into the left.

8\. Her relations tie (to her body) a red and black, woollen or linen cord with three (amulet) gems, with the verse, ‘Dark-blue and red’ (Rig. veda X, 85, 28).

9\. With the verse, ‘Full of honey the herbs’ (Rig-veda IV, 57, 3), (the bridegroom) ties (to her body) Madhûka flowers. <span id="p34">[<sup><small>p. 34</small></sup>]</span>

10 [^75]. At the wedding one cow, when the Argha ceremony has been performed; in the house one cow: these are the two Madhuparka cows.

11\. [^76]. (The bridegroom) makes the girl sit down behind the fire, and while she takes hold of him he makes three oblations with the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis. <span id="p35">[<sup><small>p. 35</small></sup>]</span>

12\. A fourth (oblation) with (the three Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis) together is to be understood from this rule.

13\. In this way, where no express rule is stated, in all sacrifices that procure happiness, one is to sacrifice before and afterwards with these same (Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis).

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 13.

1\. ‘Be queen with thy father-in-law,’ with this verse (Rig-veda X, 85, 46) her father or brother sacrifices with a sword's point on her head, or with the Sruva, standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to the east.

2\. ‘I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness’ (Rig-veda X, 85, 36), with these words (the bridegroom) seizes with his right hand her right hand with the thumb, both hands being turned with the palms upwards, he standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to the east.

3\. And when he has murmured the following five verses,

4\. [^77]. (He continues thus,) 'This am I, that art thou; <span id="p36">[<sup><small>p. 36</small></sup>]</span> that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the _Ri_<i>k</i> art thou, the Sâman I. So be thou devoted to me.

‘Well! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Let us acquire many sons who may reach old age.’

5\. (The Â<i> sva</i>ârya) fills, with the words bhûr bhuva_h<i> sva</i>h_, a new water-pot,

6\. [^78]. Throws into it (branches) with milky sap and leaves, of a tree the name of which is masculine, together with Ku<i>s</i>a grass,

7\. And gold, according to some (teachers),

8\. And hands it over to a student who observes silence.

9\. [^79]. They should walk round this Stheyâ water, (placed) to the north-east, so that they turn their right sides . towards it. <span id="p37">[<sup><small>p. 37</small></sup>]</span>

10\. And after (the Â<i>k</i>ârya) has placed a stone towards the northern direction,

11\. (The bridegroom) makes her rise with the words, ‘Come, thou joyful one,’

12\. And makes her tread with the tip of her right foot on the stone, with the words, ‘Come, tread on the stone; like a stone be firm. Tread the foes down; overcome the enemies.’

13\. He then leads her round the fire so that their right sides are turned to it,

14\. And gives her a second garment with the same text (chap. 12, § 3).

15\. Her father or brother pours out of a basket fried grain mixed with _S_amî leaves into her joined hands.

16\. The spreading under, the sprinkling over, and the second sprinkling over (are done) with Â<i>g</i>ya.

17\. [^80]. She sacrifices those (fried grains).

## KHA<i>ND</i>A 14.

1\. ‘This woman, strewing grains, prays thus, “May I bring bliss to my relations; may my husband live long. Svâhâ!”’—while the husband murmurs (this) text, she sacrifices standing.

2\. [^81]. (All the ceremonies,) beginning from the treading <span id="p38">[<sup><small>p. 38</small></sup>]</span> upon the stone, (are repeated) in the same way for a second time,

3\. And in the same way a third time.

4\. Silently, if they like, a fourth time.

5\. [^82]. (The Â<i>k</i>ârya?) makes (them) step forward in a north-eastern direction seven steps (with the words),

6\. ‘For sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for the prospering of wealth with three steps, for comfort with four steps, for cattle with five steps, for the seasons with six steps. Friend be with seven steps.’

7\. (The Â<i>k</i>ârya?) ‘appeases’ those (foot-steps) with water.

8\. [^83]. With the three Âpohish<i>th</i>îyâ verses (Rig-veda X, 9, 1-3) he wipes (them) with the Stheyâ water,

9\. [^84]. And sprinkles it on their heads.

## Footnotes

[^13]: 12:1 I, 1. The ceremonies to be treated of are defined here as the Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as (i.e. oblations of cooked offerings) just as in the opening sentence of the Pâraskara-G<i>g</i>hya they are called g<i>g</i>hyasthâlîpâkâs. This is indeed the most characteristic form of offerings belonging to the domain of the G<i>g</i>hya ritual, though it would not be correct to state that the G<i>g</i>hya-sûtras treat exclusively of sacrificial ceremonies of this kind.

[^14]: 12:2 As to the duty of the Vedic student of putting every day a piece of wood on the sacred fire of his teacher, see below, II, 6, 8, and compare the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha-pari<i>ri</i>ish<i>ri</i>a II, 58. According to a Kârikâ given by Nârâya<i>ri</i>a, and the Karmapradîpa (I, 6, 13). the prescription of this Sûtra regarding the time for the kindling of the sacred fire refers exclusively to the case of vâgdâna (betrothal). Comp. also Dr. Bloomfield's note on the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>ri</i>graha-pari<i>ri</i>ish<i>ri</i>a I, 76 (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XXXV, 560). In the Kârikâ it is stated that if the betrothed girl dies after the fire has been kindled, but before the marriage, the sacrificer is not to forsake his fire, but to marry another girl; if he cannot find a bride, he should make the fire enter into himself according to the rules given by <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya V, 1, and himself become uttarâ<i>ri</i>ramin, i.e. enter one of the two final Â<i>ri</i>ramas.

[^15]: 13:5 Nârâya<i>n</i>a: 'If the fire has not been kindled at the time stated above, then, after the householder . . . i.e. the father, even if he should not have performed the âdhâna, or the elder brother has died, the eldest son (or the son who after his elder brother's death has become the eldest), after he has performed the Sapi<i>n</i><i>n</i>îkara<i>n</i>a (for the dead father or brother; see below, IV, 3, and the ninth chapter of the Pari<i>n</i>ish<i>n</i>a \[book V\]), even if he has not divided the inheritance with his younger brothers (so that the time stated in the fourth Sûtra would not have arrived), should kindle the fire himself, i.e. without an officiating priest (_ri<i>n</i>g_). . . . Or the Sûtra should be divided into two; prete vâ g<i>n</i>hapatau (or after the death of the householder), and svaya_m<i>n</i>g_yâyân (the eminent one himself), i.e. of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<i>n</i>yas a <i>g</i>yâyân, which means a most eminent person, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, performs the Pâkaya<i>n</i><i>n</i>as himself; for the two other castes the Pâkaya<i>n</i><i>n</i>as have to be performed through an officiating priest: this is the meaning of this svaya<i>m</i> (himself).' I have given this note of Nârâya<i>n</i>a as a specimen of the entirely arbitrary and obviously misleading explanations which are unfortunately so frequently found in this author, as indeed in most of the other Sûtra commentators. As to the true meaning of this svaya<i>m</i> I still adhere to the explanation which I proposed in my German edition of the text (p. 118), that in case no division of the inheritance takes place, the sacred fire should be kindled on behalf of all the joint-proprietors, but that only the eldest brother should act personally (svaya<i>m</i>).

[^16]: 13:8 Or, ‘at (the fire of) a person rich in cattle, in the house of a Vai<i>s</i>ya,’ &c.? The commentators (see p. 118 of the German p. 14 edition) differ as to whether in purupa<i>s</i>u-vi<i>s</i>kula one or two alternatives are contained, and it is interesting to see that the Sûtra authors themselves differed in this respect; Pâraskara (I, 2, 3), when declaring from what place the fire should be fetched, speaks of the house of a Vai<i>s</i>ya rich in cattle; Â<i>s</i>valâyana, on the contrary, who in the G<i>s</i>hya-sûtra does not expressly treat of the kindling of the domestic fire, in the corresponding passage of the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra (II, 2, 1), gives the rule that the dakshi<i>s</i>âgni is to be fetched from the house of a Vai<i>s</i>ya or from a rich person.’

[^17]: 14:9-11 9-11. I now differ from the opinion which I pronounced in my German edition with regard to the relation in which these three Sûtras stand to each other. I think they ought to be understood thus: 9. Some teachers say that the fetching of the fire from its yoni, as taught in Sûtra 8, ought to be done twice; in the evening, so that the fire, after the necessary rites have been performed, goes out, and then again in the morning. 10. But my (the author's) teacher (comp. as to a<i>k</i>âryâ_h_, Kâtyâyana's <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra I, 3, 7; Professor Garbe's note on Vaitâna-sûtra 1, 3) is of opinion that the fire should be fetched only once, and that with this fire the ceremonies which are taught by the Adhvaryus are to be performed in the evening (see, for instance, Kâty. IV, 7. 8, which passage is paraphrased here by Nârâya<i>k</i>a). 11. In the morning (according to the same teacher, not, as I once understood this passage, according to the eke referred to in Sûtra 9), a full oblation is to be offered, &c.

[^20]: 15:15 With regard to the twenty-one kinds of sacrifice compare, for instance, Gautama VIII, 18-20; Max Müller, Z_D__M__G_. IX, p. lxxiii; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 326. The seven kinds of Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>g</i>as are the Ash<i>g</i>akâ sacrifices (see below, III, 12 seq.), the sacrifices offered at each Parvan (I, 3), the _S_râddha (or funeral) sacrifices (IV, 1 seq.), the sacrifice of the _S<i>g</i>n_î full moon (IV, 19), of the Âgrahâya<i>g</i>î (IV, 17 seq.), of the _K_aitrî (IV, 19), and of the Â<i>g</i>vayu<i>g</i>î (IV, 16). The seven Havis sacrifices (belonging, as is the case also with the third division of sacrifices, to the <i>S</i>rauta ritual) are the Agnyâdheya, the Agnihotra, the sacrifices of the full and new moon, the Âgraya<i>g</i>a, the three _K_âturmâsya sacrifices, the Nirû<i>g</i>apa<i>g</i>ubandha, and the Sautrâma<i>g</i>î. The seven kinds of Soma sacrifices (of which the more ancient texts mention only three or four sa<i>g</i>sthâs, see Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 1 20) are the Agnish<i>g</i>oma, the Atyagnish<i>g</i>oma, the Ukthya, the Sho<i>g</i>a<i>g</i>in, the Atirâtra, the Aptoryâma.

[^21]: 16:1 3, 1. Most probably this rule should be divided into two Sûtras, so that atha darsapûr<i>n</i>amâsau would stand as the heading of the chapter; comp. below, chap. 18, 1, atha <i>k</i>aturthîkarma; chap. 24, 1, atha <i>k</i>âtakarma, &c.

The deities of the festivals of the new and full moon (i.e. of the rites which in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual correspond to that taught here) are, at the full moon, Agni and Agnîshomau, at the new moon, Agni, Vish<i>n</i>u, and Indrâgnî, who are preceded in both cases by Agni and Soma as the deities of the two â<i>n</i>yabhâgas (see below, ch. 9, 7), and followed by Agni Svish<i>n</i>ak<i>n</i>t. For more detailed statements see Hillebrandt, Das altindische Neu- und Vollmondsopfer (Jena, 1879), pp. 102 seq.

[^24]: 17:4 For instance, the taking of the portion of food destined to Agni should be performed with the Mantra: Agnaye tvâ _g<i>ushta</i>m<i>ushta</i>ri<i>ushta</i>n_âmi, &c. A number of ceremonies common to the Sthâlîpâka ritual and to the ordinary ritual of Â<i>ushta</i>ya oblations, such as the strewing of Ku<i>ushta</i>a grass round the fire, the ceremonies regarding the Pavitras (strainers), &c., have to be supplied here from the Â<i>ushta</i>ya ritual given below (ch. 7 seq.); this may be looked upon as an argument in favour of our conjecture which will be stated in the preface (vol. ii of the G<i>ushta</i>hya-sûtras), that our text, as probably is the case also with the Pâraskara-sûtra, is based on an original, the opening sentences of which are preserved to us in _S_âṅkh. I, 5, 1-5 = Pâraskara I, 4, 1-5, so that the first chapters of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, and among them the exposition of the festivals of the full and new moon, would have been prefixed to the original commencement of the text.

The Paddhati of Râma<i>k</i>andra understands svâdhyâyam adhîyîta as a prescription to perform the daily Brahmaya<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (comp., for instance, Â<i>k</i>valâyana-G<i>k</i>hya III, 2; Âpastamba I, 11, 22 seq.), which consists in the recitation of portions of the Veda; the hymns and verses stated in Sûtra 2 are, according to the same authority, to be repeated immediately after the recitation of the svâdhyâya (‘svâdhyâyânantaram’). Nârâya<i>k</i>a, on the contrary, considers that the svâdhyâya prescribed in Sûtra 1 consists of those very hymns and verses which are indicated in the second Sûtra. As to the Brahmaya<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, he says that the <i>k</i>a at the end of the second Sûtra may be referred to it (‘the word <i>k</i>a means that texts procuring a long life, such as Rig-veda I, 89, should be murmured, or an injunction of the Brahmaya<i>k</i><i>k</i>a is intended’). At all events it is very difficult to believe that the recitation of the texts stated in this chapter should be quite independent from the daily Brahmaya<i>k</i><i>k</i>a.

[^60]: 28:11 See chap. 8, 13.

[^61]: 28:12 This Sûtra prescribes where the âvâpa, i.e. the special characteristical offerings of each sacrifice, is to be inserted between the regular offerings that belong to the standing model. The same subject is treated of in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra in the two rules, I, 16, 3 and 4: ‘Whatsoever is offered between the two Â<i>t</i>ya portions and the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, that is called âvâpa; this is the chief part (pradhâna) (of the sacrifice); the other (oblations) are subordinate thereto (tadaṅgâni).’ The position of the âvâpa among the other oblations is indicated by Pâraskara in the following rule (I, 5, 6): Between the general expiation and the oblation to Pra<i>t</i>âpati, this is the place for the âvâpa.' (The word vivâhe at the end of this Sûtra seems to me to belong not to this rule, but to Sûtra 7.) Our Sûtra is identical with that of Pâraskara word for word; only instead of sarvaprâya<i>t</i><i>t</i>itta, as Pâraskara has, we read here, mahâvyâh<i>t</i>tisarvaprâya<i>t</i><i>t</i>itta. This means, I believe, that the âvâpa, preceded and followed by the Mahâvyâh<i>t</i>ti oblations (comp. below, I, 12, 13), should be placed between the Sarvaprâya<i>t</i><i>t</i>itta and the Prâ<i>t</i>âpatya oblation. The oblations made with the Mahâvyâh<i>t</i>tayas are four in number; the corresponding formulas are: bhû<i>h</i> svâhâ, bhuva<i>h</i> svâhâ, svâ<i>h</i> svâhâ, bhûr bhuva_h<i>t</i>h_ svâhâ (comp. below, chap. 12, 12). The Sarvaprâya<i>t</i><i>t</i>itta (general expiation) consists of two oblations, one with the three Mahâvyâh<i>t</i>tayas, the other with the verse ayâ_s<i>t</i>k_âgne, quoted in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra III, 19, 3, and in Â<i>t</i>valâyana's <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra I, 11, 13. (On the Sarvaprâya<i>t</i><i>t</i>itta in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual, compare Hillebrandt, Neu- und Vollmondsopfer, p. 166.) The Prâ<i>t</i>âpatya oblation is performed with the formula Pra<i>t</i>âpataye svâhâ. The discussions of Nârâya<i>t</i>a on this Sûtra (see p. 125 of the German edition) evidently fail to bring out the true meaning of the text; according to this commentator the oblations follow each other in this order: the two Â<i>t</i>yabhâgas, the principal oblations (pradhânâhutaya<i>h</i>), the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, the four Mahâvyâh<i>t</i>ti oblations, the two Sarvaprâya<i>t</i><i>t</i>itta oblations, the Prâ<i>t</i>âpatya oblation. Finally we may mention the corrupt form in which the corresponding passage of the _S_âmbavya-sûtra is preserved p. 29 in the MS. There the two Sûtras 10 and 11 are placed before the Mantra in Sûtra 9. This Mantra then is given down to svâheti, then follows â<i>t</i>yena, which seems to me to form part of the same Sûtra, and to refer to the oblations to which the Mantra belongs. Then the MS. goes on: mahâvyâh<i>t</i>tishu sarvaprâya<i>t</i><i>t</i>ittâra_m<i>t</i>m<i>t</i>g<i>t</i>ri<i>t</i>s_<i>t</i>ittâra_m<i>t</i>s_<i>t</i>ittâra_m<i>t</i>t<i>t</i>ri_to sthâlîpâke.

[^63]: 29:19 This Sûtra, though reckoned in the Indian tradition to p. 30 chap. 9, seems to me clearly to belong to the next chapter, and to contain the subject, to which the predicate is given in 10, 1. For prati<i>s</i>rute, see chap. 7, 1.

[^64]: 30:1 10, 1. ‘As in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual the sacrifice of the full and new moon forms the standard for the ish</i>t_is, the pa<i>rauta ritual the sacrifice of the full and new moon forms the standard for the ish</i>ubandha, &c., thus the prati<i>rauta ritual the sacrifice of the full and new moon forms the standard for the ish</i>rut-kalpa is the standard for the vik<i>rauta ritual the sacrifice of the full and new moon forms the standard for the ish</i>tis of the Smârta ritual, such as the <i>g</i>âtakarman (chap. 24), &c.’ Nârâya<i>rauta ritual the sacrifice of the full and new moon forms the standard for the ish</i>a.

It is clear from <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, that a real anointing of bridegroom and bride took place. This was performed, according to Gobhila, by the ‘audaka’ (this seems to be the same person that is mentioned in Pâraskara I, 8, 3), of whom it is said, pâ<i>ñ</i>igrâha<i>m</i> (i.e. the bridegroom) mûrdhade<i>ñ</i>e ’vasi<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ati, tathetarâm. Nârâya<i>ñ</i>a, on the contrary, in his note on our passage, says that it is the bridegroom who anoints the eyes of the girl with the verse quoted. But the word sam-a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ana, and the obvious meaning of the whole rite, make it rather probable that both were anointed, and that this was done by a third person.

[^76]: 34:10 As to the meaning of arhayitvâ I differ from the opinion of Nârâya<i>n</i>a (see his note on p. 127 of the German edition), who takes gâm as the object of this verb (gâm arhayitvâ pû<i>n</i>ayitvâ mâtâ rudrâ<i>n</i>âm ity _ri_<i>n</i>a_m<i>n</i>g_apitvâ \[comp. Pâraskara I, 3, 27\]). The real meaning of arhayati is, to perform the Argha ceremony for a guest. Evidently in this Sûtra two different occasions are stated on which the Argha reception, eventually with the killing of a cow, should be performed; firstly, the bridegroom should be so received in the house of the bride's father; secondly, when the newly-married people have arrived at their own house, an Argha reception should there be offered to them, perhaps, as the commentaries state, by the Â<i>n</i>ârya.

[^77]: 34:11 According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a it is the Â<i>n</i>ârya who performs the rite prescribed in this Sûtra; Râma<i>n</i>andra, on the contrary, refers it to the bridegroom, which seems to me right. Comp. Gobhila II, 1.
  In <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana's description of the wedding ceremonies the point at which the bride passes over from the paternal power into that of her new husband is not expressly indicated. Pâraskara (I, 4, 15) clearly indicates it (pitrâ prattâm âdâya), and in the Pari<i>s</i>ish<i>s</i>a of the Â<i>s</i>valâyana-G<i>s</i>hya this act of handing over the girl is treated of in detail (I, 22). On this depends the description in the Prayogaratna, fol. 69; comp. also Colebrooke's Miscell. Essays, I, 210. The Paddhati of Râma<i>s</i>andra does not fail to mention the kanyâpradâna, but I do not think that the succession of the different rites is stated there correctly. According to the Paddhati the bridegroom goes to the house of the girl's father, and there, after the madhuparka has been offered, the bride is given over to him; he then (labdhavadhûka<i>h</i>) goes (chap. 12, 1), accompanied by young women, to the kautukâgâra, where the ceremonies described in chap. 12, 3 seq. take place. Pâraskara, on the contrary, describes the handing over of the garments, the anointing, &c., as preceding the giving over of the girl, and indeed it is scarcely possible to see in the acts of dressing, adorning the girl, &c., in which both the bridegroom and her relations p. 35 take part, anything but preparatory performances that precede the decisive moment. The sacrifice, on the contrary, which the bridegroom performs, according to chap. 12, 11, in common with his bride, seems to presuppose that he has already received her from her father; and the ceremonies described in chap. 13, the pâ<i>s</i>igraha<i>s</i>a, the pronouncing of the Mantra, chap. 13, 4, which reminds one of the Roman formula ubi tu Gaius, the seven steps—all that should be understood not as intended to establish the power of the husband over his wife, but as presupposing that power and showing an exercise of it.

[^78]: 35:4 13, 4. Nârâya<i>n</i>a states that here four Brâhma<i>n</i>as should repeat p. 36 the Sûryâ hymn (Rig-veda X, 85) to the bride. That, according to <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, that hymn is recited at the wedding, is clear from chap. 14, 12.

[^79]: 36:6 Sakshîrânt sapalâ<i>s</i>ânt saku<i>s</i>ân. Nârâya<i>s</i>a's commentary divides sa ku<i>s</i>ân, and refers sa to the â<i>s</i>ârya. But this sa would be superfluous, and the substantive to which sakshîrân and sapalâ<i>s</i>ân are to be referred, is, as both the nature of the case and the corresponding passages show, _s<i>s</i>s_ân. Comp. the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra IV, 17, 5: palâsa<i>s</i>âkhâ_m<i>s</i>s<i>s</i>m_ nikhâya, and a passage concerning the very rite here described, Â<i>s</i>valâyana-pari<i>s</i>ish<i>s</i>a I, 24: audumbaryârddhayâ. (read, ârdrayâ?) _s<i>s</i>s<i>s</i>n_yapavitrayâ sadûrvâpavitrayâ. The MS. of the _S<i>s</i>s<i>s</i>s_ân.

[^80]: 36:9 ‘The Stheyâ water has to be so placed that when the bride and the bridegroom walk (their seven steps, see chap. 14, 5 seq.), their right sides are turned towards it.’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a. Comp., regarding the Stheyâ water and its bearer, the G<i>n</i>hya-sa<i>n</i>graha-pari<i>n</i>ish<i>n</i>a II, 26. 30. 35.

[^81]: 37:17 I believe that the words forming this Sûtra, tâ_ñ<i>ri</i>g_uhoti, are taken from the same lost old G<i>ri</i>hya text which <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana has followed word for word also in I, 5, 1-5 and elsewhere. This is made probable by the comparison of Pâraskara I, 6, 2. The author of our text, while literally adopting the words of his original, has not quite succeeded in welding them together with his own statements; thus the sacrifice of grains is treated of in this Sûtra and in the first Sûtra of the next chapter, as if there were two different acts, while indeed it is one and the same.

[^82]: 37:2 14, 2. The treading on the stone is prescribed in chap. 13, 12.

[^83]: 38:5 5, 7. According to Nârâya<i>n</i>a it is the teacher who makes them walk the seven steps; the Paddhati says that the bridegroom or the Â<i>n</i>ârya causes her to do so. Comp. Pâraskara I, 8, 1; Â<i>n</i>valâyana I, 7, 19, &c.

[^84]: 38:8 Comp. chap. 13, 9.

[^85]: 38:9 Probably we should read mûrdhanî (acc. dual.), not mûrdhani. Â<i>valâyana has </i>valâyana has <i>s</i>irasî. Of course the heads of both the bridegroom and the bride were sprinkled with water; comp. Â<i>valâyana has </i>valâyana I, 7, 20, &c.

[^86]: 38:12 The Sûryâ hymn is Rig-veda X, 85. Comp. the note above on chap. 13, 4.

[^87]: 39:13-15 These Sûtras, treating of the fee for the sacrifice, are identical with Pâraskara I, 8, 15-18. Apparently they are taken from the same lost original from which several identical passages in the Sûtras of Pâraskara and <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana seem to be derived (see the notes on chap. 5, 1; 13, 7). They stand rather out of place here, for they return to the same subject which had already been treated of in Sûtra 10, though in that Sûtra, as very frequently is the case in our text and in similar ones, only the case of the bridegroom being a Brâhma<i>n</i>a has been taken notice of.

[^88]: 39:16 Comp. the passages quoted by Professor Stenzler on Pâraskara I, 8, 18. Nârâya<i>n</i>a has the following note: ‘To a duhit<i>n</i>mat, i.e. to the father of a girl who has no brother, he shall give a hundred cows and besides a chariot, in order to destroy the guilt brought about by marrying a girl who has no brother.’ Possibly we should here emancipate ourselves from the authority of the commentators, and explain duhit<i>n</i>mat ‘he who gives his daughter in marriage,’ the bride's father. Comp. Âpastamba II, 11, 18; II, 13, 12; Weber, Indische Studien, V, 343, note 2.

[^89]: 39:3 15, 3. Probably the use of this verse on this occasion rests on the assonance of its opening word akshan and aksha (rathâksha).

[^90]: 40:6 See Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note on <i>s</i>amyâgarta, p. 129 of the German edition.

[^91]: 41:1 16, 1. In chap. 15, 22 it is said that the bride arrives at the house; in 16, 12, that she enters the house. Probably we are to understand, therefore, that the sacrifice prescribed in this chapter, Sûtras 2 seq., is performed before the house, like the Vâstoshpatîya karman (below, III, 4). The words, ‘has been declared,’ refer to the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra (IV, r6, 2), 'Having spread a red bull's skin, with the neck to the north or to the east, with the hair outside, behind the fire, they sit down,' &c.

[^92]: 41:2 On anvârambha comp. the quotation in the note on chap. II, 2.

[^93]: 42:8 It should be noted that the verse â te yonim is quoted here only with the Pratika, while its full text is given below, chap. 19, 6. Can the Sûtras describing this ceremony with the kumâra ubhayata_h_\-su<i>g</i>âta be a later addition?

[^94]: 43:2-3 17, 2, 3. I have changed in the translation the division of these Sûtras; the native authorities divide after dhruvadar<i>s</i>anât, while I propose to divide after astamite.

[^95]: 44:3 18, 3. As to preto mu<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>âtu mâmuta<i>h</i> compare Pâraskara I, 6, 2: preto mu<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>âtu mâ pate_h_. This passage shows what ita_h<i>ñ</i>h_ refer to. Comp. Professor Weber's note 3 at Indische Studien, V, 347.

[^96]: 45:6 19, 6. The first verse is that quoted already at chap. 16, 8. The text of the verses quoted in this Sûtra is very corrupt; see the notes on p. 36 of the German edition.

[^97]: 46:3 20, 3. On <i>s</i>uṅgâ compare the note of Nârâya<i>n</i>a and the verse quoted from the Karmapradîpa, p. 131 of the German edition.

On ku<i>s</i>aka<i>s</i><i>s</i>aka Nârâya<i>s</i>a says, ku<i>s</i>aka<i>s</i><i>s</i>aka_m<i>s</i>s<i>s</i>n_<i>s</i>aka_h<i>s</i>k<i>s</i>k_a, MS. Berol.

I, 14, 4, make ka<i>s</i><i>s</i>aka equal to mûla.

[^98]: 46:5 Nasto dakshi<i>n</i>ata<i>h</i> stands here as in chap. 19, 1. Â<i>n</i>valâyana I, 13, 6 has dakshi<i>n</i>asyâ<i>h</i> nâsikâyâm, and so has also p. 47 Pâraskara I, 13. Comp. the natthukamma treated of in the Pâli Buddhist texts (Mahâvagga VI, 13) and in the medical literature.

[^100]: 48:10 Nârâya<i>n</i>a: tis<i>n</i>bhis tantubhir v<i>n</i>tte sûtre udumbaraphalâni . . . gale . . . badhnâti. I have translated accordingly. Pâraskara I, 15, 6 uses the same expression triv<i>n</i>t. Professor Stenzler there translates it, on the authority of <i>G</i>ayarâma, ‘dreifache Haarflechte,’ and says in his note on that passage that, according to <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, he would have to tie the things with a threefold string to the neck of the woman, as if <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana's statement were different from that of Pâraskara. But both authors have the same word, and only the commentators differ in their explanations thereof.

[^101]: 48:11 Â<i> râ</i>valâyana more explicitly says (I, 14, 6), Soma_m<i> râ</i>g<i> râ</i>m<i> râ</i>m_gâyetâm iti.

[^102]: 48:13 In my German translation there is a mistake which should be corrected. I have there referred shal<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a to the verses Râkâm p. 79 aham, which are actually only five in number. The six verses are Vish<i>ri</i>ur yonim, &c., and the five verses mentioned.

[^105]: 49:1 24, 1. Comp. Dr. Speijer's essay on the _G_âtakarman (Leiden, 1872). Nârâya<i>n</i>a observes that, as it is prescribed below (chap. 25, 4) that a mess of food is to be cooked in the sûtikâgni, here the sûtikâgni is established, and sacrifice is performed therein. The Sûtra I, 25, 4, from which it is to be inferred that the sûtikâgni should be kept, is considered, accordingly, as a _G_<i>n</i>âpaka (see Professor Bühler's notes on Âpastamba I, II, 7; Gautama p. 50 I, 31; Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note on chap. 25, 4, p. 133 of the German edition).

[^106]: 50:2 Abhyavânya should be corrected into abhyapânya, as in IV, 18, 1 nearly all the MSS. read nivâta instead of nipâta. The _S_âmbavya MS. reads in the text, trir abhyânyânuprâ<i>n</i>ya; in the commentary trir a<i>n</i>yapâ<i>n</i>yânuprâ<i>n</i>yâ.

[^110]: 52:4 Comp. the note on chap. 24, 1.

[^111]: 52:7 The first Mantra is corrupt; in the Â<i>valâyana-</i>valâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra (II, 10, 4) its text runs thus, âyush _t<i>valâyana-</i>s<i>valâyana-</i>n<i>valâyana-</i>h_, &c. Comp. Atharva-veda VII, 53, 6.

[^112]: 52:11 ‘The words “every month” (Sûtra 10) retain their value p. 53(here also). Thus the sûtikâgni is to be kept through one year. After the lapse of that year one should sacrifice every month on the domestic fire as long as his life lasts. As it is said “in the domestic fire,” the sûtikâgni is not to be kept any longer.’ Nârâya<i>n</i>a.

[^113]: 53:1 26, 1. This chapter is not found in the _S_âmbavya-G<i>ri</i>hya, and Nârâya<i>ri</i>a expressly designates it as kshepaka kha<i>ri</i><i>ri</i>a. It is a sort of appendix to the Sûtras 25, 5. 6; a sacrifice having there been prescribed to three Nakshatras with their presiding deities, an enumeration of the Nakshatras and deities is here given. Compare, on similar lists, Weber's second article on the Nakshatras seq. (Abhandlungen der Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1861), pp. 289 , 315, 367 seq.

[^114]: 54:2-6 27, 2-6. These rules stand here, in the beginning of the chapter, as introductory remarks; the act of feeding itself (Sûtra 10) does not follow till after the sacrifice and the other performances prescribed in Sûtras 7-9.

[^115]: 54:3 This rule evidently rests on the allusion of taittira (partridge flesh) to the Taittirîya school.

[^116]: 54:7 Both metre and construction show that the Pâda imam Agna âyushe var<i>k</i>ase is incomplete; the _S_âmbavya-G<i>k</i>hya and Taitt. Sa<i>k</i>hitâ II, 3, 10, 3 add k<i>k</i>dhi after var<i>k</i>ase.

[^117]: 55:1 28, 1. _K<i>û</i>l_âkarman literally means, the preparing of the lock or the locks (left when the rest of the hair is shaven).

[^118]: 56:15 The parallel texts show that instead of B<i>ri</i>haspatir we have to read B<i>ri</i>haspater, instead of adya, asya. So the correct translation would be, '. . . with what Dhâtar has shaven B<i>ri</i>haspati's and Indra's head, with that do ye Brâhma<i>ri</i>as shave this head of this (child).’
