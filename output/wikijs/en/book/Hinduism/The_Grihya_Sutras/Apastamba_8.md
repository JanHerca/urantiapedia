[^791]: 293:2 I believe that _s<i>esha</i>h_ means the rest of the cake. The word ‘siddha_h_’ possibly refers to such preparations of the food as are indicated in Hira<i>esha</i>yak. II, 5, 14, 7. Haradatta understands _s<i>esha</i>h<i>esha</i>s<i>esha</i>h_): ‘The rest of the rites is p. 294 the regular one, without alterations:’ it must be admitted that the expressions used by Hira<i>esha</i>yak. II, 5, 14, 10 would agree well with this explanation.
