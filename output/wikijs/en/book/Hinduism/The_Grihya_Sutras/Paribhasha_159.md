## SÛTRA CLI.

From the end there takes place omission or addition.

<span id="an151c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This refers again to the same subject, namely what has to be done if there are either more or less mantras than there are acts which they are to accompany. In that case it is here allowed to use as many mantras as there are acts, and to drop the rest of the mantras. Or, if there are less mantras than there are acts, then, after the mantras have been equally divided, the last verse is to be multiplied. For instance, in the Dvikapâla sacrifice for the two A<i>s</i>vins, the placing of the two kapâlas is accompanied by two mantras. The rest of the mantras enjoined in the prak<i>s</i>ti is left out. But if there are, for instance, twelve or more ish<i>s</i>akâs, bricks, to be placed, while there are only ten mantras, then the mantras are equally divided, and the fifth and tenth to be repeated, as many times as is necessary to equal the number of the ish<i>s</i>akâs.

<span id="an152"></span>

## SÛTRA CLII.

As the Prak<i>ri</i>ti has been told before, anything that has not been told before, should be at the end.

<span id="an152c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This seems to mean that anything new, peculiar to a Vik<i>ri</i>ti, and not mentioned in the Prak<i>ri</i>ti, should come in at the end, that is, after those portions of the sacrifice which are enjoined in the Prak<i>ri</i>ti.

<span id="an153"></span>

## SÛTRA CLIII.

The rule should stand on account of the fitness of the Kumbhi, a large pot, the <i>S</i>ûla, the spit for boiling the heart, and the two Vapâ<i>s</i>rapa<i>s</i>îs, the spits for roasting the vapâ.

<span id="an153c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Kumbhî is explained by sro<i>n</i>yâdipâkasamarthâ <span id="p361">[<sup><small>p. 361</small></sup>]</span> b<i>n</i>hatî sthâlî; _S<i>n</i>ri<i>n</i>t<i>n</i>h_, and Vapâ<i>n</i>rapa<i>n</i>î by vapâ<i>n</i>rapa<i>n</i>ârthe yash<i>n</i>î dve. The exact object of the Sûtra is not quite clear. Prabhutva is explained by samarthatva, that is, fitness. This would mean, that on account of their fitness, or because they can be used for the object for which they are intended, or, so long as they can be used, the rule applying to them should remain. The commentary explains tantram by tantratâ or ekatâ. It may mean that the same pots and spits should be used, so long as they fulfil their purpose. The next Sûtra would then form a natural limitation.

<span id="an154"></span>

## SÛTRA CLIV.

But if there is a different kind of animal, there is difference (in pots and spits), owing to the diversity of cooking.

<span id="an154c"></span>

**Commentary.**

If different animals are to be cooked, then there must be different pots for each (pratipa<i>s</i>um), because each requires a different kind of cooking. The commentary adds that, as the reason for using different pots is given, that reason applies also to young and old animals of the same kind (_g_âti), i, e. the young and small animal would require a different pot and a different kind of cooking.

<span id="an155"></span>

## SÛTRA CLV.

At the Vanaspati sacrifice, which is a modification (vikâra) of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, the addresses (nigama) of the deities should take place in the Yâ<i>t</i>yâ, because they are included in the Prak<i>t</i>ti.

<span id="an155c"></span>

**Commentary.**

These nigamas of the deities are not mentioned in the rules of the Vanaspati sacrifice, but they are mentioned in the rules for the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t sacrifice of the Dar<i>t</i>apûr<i>t</i>amâsa, which is the Prak<i>t</i>ti, and should therefore be taken over. Here again, because a reason is given, it is <span id="p362">[<sup><small>p. 362</small></sup>]</span> understood that the same reason would apply to other portions of Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t also, such as the Dvir abhighâra<i>t</i>a, which is to be retained in the Vanaspati sacrifice.

<span id="an156"></span>

## SÛTRA CLVI.

The Anvârambha<i>ri</i>îyâ or initiatory ceremony does not take place in a Vik<i>ri</i>ti, because the Vik<i>ri</i>tis would fall within the time of the Prak<i>ri</i>ti, and the Anvârambha<i>ri</i>îyâ has but one object, namely (the initiation of) the Dar<i>ri</i>a-pûr<i>ri</i>amâsa sacrifice.

<span id="an156c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Anvârambha<i>s</i>îyâ ceremony has to be performed by those who begin the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice. It has thus one object only, and is never enjoined for any other cause. It is not therefore transferred to any Vik<i>s</i>ti, such as the Saurya ceremony, &c. The Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice having to be performed during the whole of life, or during thirty years, the Vik<i>s</i>tis would necessarily fall within the same space of time. The initiatory ceremony has reference to the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice only, and thus serves as an introduction to all the Vik<i>s</i>tis, without having to be repeated for each.

<span id="an157"></span>

## SÛTRA CLVII.

Or (according to others) the Anvârambha<i>ri</i>îyâ should take place (in the Vik<i>ri</i>tis also), because the time (of the Dar<i>ri</i>a-pûr<i>ri</i>amâsa) does not form an essential part.

<span id="an157c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This Sûtra is not quite clear. It shows clearly enough that, according to some authorities, the Anvârambha<i>s</i>îyâ or initiatory ceremony of the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice should take place in the Vik<i>s</i>tis also; but why? Because the time has not the character of a <i>s</i>esha, which is said to be a synonym of aṅga, an essential part of a sacrifice. <span id="p363">[<sup><small>p. 363</small></sup>]</span> When it is said that the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa should be performed during life, this is not meant as determining the time of the sacrifice. It only means that so long as there is life a man should perform these sacrifices, and that their non-performance would constitute a sin. The former argument, therefore, that the time of the Vik<i>s</i>ti sacrifices would fall within the time of the Prak<i>s</i>ti sacrifice is not tenable.

<span id="an158"></span>

## SÛTRA CLVIII.

And again, because there is difference in the undertaking.

<span id="an158c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Ârambha, the beginning, is explained as the determination to perform a certain sacrifice (dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>s</i>amâsâbhyây_m<i>s</i>s_<i>s</i>ayapura<i>s</i>sara_h<i>s</i>h_). The object of the undertaking in the case of the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice, as the Prak<i>s</i>ti, is simply svarga, in the Vik<i>s</i>tis it may be any kind of desire. Therefore the Anvârambha<i>s</i>îyâ ceremony of the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsas should be transferred to its Vik<i>s</i>tis. This seems to have been the opinion of the same authorities who are referred to in Sûtra CLVII. The final outcome of the whole controversy, however, is clearly that our Â<i>s</i>ârya is in favour of omitting the Anvârambha<i>s</i>îyâ in the Vik<i>s</i>tis. Anayo_h<i>s</i>n<i>s</i>k_âryâbhilashitam iti manyâmahe. The Anvârambha<i>s</i>îyâ is not to be considered as an ordinary Aṅga, but as a special act to fit the sacrificer to perform the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa and to perform it through the whole of his life.

<span id="an159"></span>

## SÛTRA CLIX.

For every object (new sacrifice) let him bring forward the fire (let him perform the Agnipra<i>n</i>ayana, the fetching of the Âhavanîya from the Gârhapatya fire). When the sacrifice is finished <span id="p364">[<sup><small>p. 364</small></sup>]</span> the fire becomes again ordinary fire, as when the (divine) fire has returned (to the firesticks).

<span id="an159c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The fire for a sacrifice is supposed to be set apart or consecrated (_s_âstrîya), but it is so for a special sacrifice only, and when that sacrifice is ended, it is supposed to become like ordinary fire again. Artha is prayo<i>g</i>ana, the sacrifice for which the fire is intended (agnisâdhyavihitakarmânush<i>g</i>ânam; tasya tasya vihitasya karma<i>g</i>oऽnush<i>g</i>ânârtha_m<i>g</i>n_ayet). The commentator remarks that there are two Agnis, the one who is visible, the other who is the god. Now while the divine Agni leaves the coals and ascends or is absorbed again in the two firesticks (ara<i>g</i>î), the other remains like ordinary kitchen fire. See on Samâroha<i>g</i>a, Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 311; Â<i>g</i>valâyana-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtra III, 10, 4-5.
