## SÛTRA LI.

It is the same with numbers.

<span id="an51c"></span>

**Commentary.**

If we read that, as in the case of fees to be given to priests, two, seven, eleven, twelve, twenty-one, sixty, or a hundred, this means that either one or the other, not that all should be given at the same time.

<span id="an52"></span>

## SÛTRA LII.

But accumulation is meant in the buying (of Soma), in the redemption, and in initiation.

<span id="an52c"></span>

**Commentary.**

When it is said that Soma is bought for a goat, gold, &c., that it is re-bought from the priests by means of a fee, or that at the time of the Dîkshâ, the purification and initiation of a sacrificer, clothes, gold, grain, &c., should be given, these are cases not of aut-aut but of et-et.

The Soma-plant, which is supposed to be bought from northern barbarians, is botanically described in an Âyur-vedic extract, quoted in the Dhûrtasvâmi-bhâshya<i>t</i>îkâ (MS. E.I.H. 531, p. 3b), as

<span id="p330">[<sup><small>p. 330</small></sup>]</span>

_s<i>yâmâlâmlâ </i>k<i>yâmâlâmlâ </i>n<i>yâmâlâmlâ </i>k<i>yâmâlâmlâ </i>m_salâ, _s<i>yâmâlâmlâ </i>kh<i>yâmâlâmlâ </i>g_anam. ‘The creeper called Soma is dark, sour, without leaves, milky, fleshy on the surface, producing phlegm and vomiting, food for goats.’

This passage, quoted from some Âyur-vedic text, is still the only one which gives an approximative description of the Soma-plant. Dr. Hooker says that the predicates ‘sour and milky’ point to Sarcostemma, but the question is not decided yet. For further information see George Watt, The Soma Plant, an extract from the third volume of the Dictionary of Economic Products of India, and Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, pp. 14 seq.

<span id="an53"></span>

## SÛTRA LIII.

If one has performed an offering to Rudra, to the Râkshasas, to Nir<i>ri</i>ti, or to the Pit<i>ri</i>s, if one has cut or broken or thrown away anything, or rubbed oneself, &c., one should touch water.

<span id="an53c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The touching of water is for the sake of purification. Nirasana is left out in some MSS. The <i>k</i>a, inserted after abhimar<i>s</i>anâni, is explained, as usual, as including other acts also, corresponding to our etc.

<span id="an54"></span>

## SÛTRA LIV.

All priestly performances take place on the northern side of the Vihâra.

<span id="an54c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Uttarata-upa<i>k</i>âra<i>h</i> has to be taken as a compound. Vihâra is explained as vihriyanteऽgnaya_h<i>k</i>n<i>k</i>k<i>k</i>s_e, i.e. the sacrificial ground. Upa<i>k</i>âra is explained as adhvaryvâdînâ_m<i>k</i>m_<i>k</i>ara_h_, and this sa<i>k</i><i>k</i>ara, according to Kâtyâyana I, 3, 42, is the path between the <i>K</i>âtvâla and Utkara, the Utkara being on the west, the pra<i>k</i>îtâs on the east of the Vihâra. Kâtyâyana I, 8, 26, expresses the same rule by uttarata-upa<i>k</i>âro ya<i>k</i><i>k</i>a_h_, the vihâra being the place where the ya<i>k</i><i>k</i>a takes place. <span id="p331">[<sup><small>p. 331</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an55"></span>

## SÛTRA LV.

The priest should never turn away from the fire, i.e. should never turn his back on the altar.

<span id="an56"></span>

## SÛTRA LVI.

Nor from the Vihâra.

<span id="an57"></span>

## SÛTRA LVII.

Sacrificial utensils should be turned inside, the performers being outside.

<span id="an57c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The meaning is that the priest should carry such things is spoons, vessels, &c., holding them towards the altar. The sacrificer and his wife should likewise be on the inside of the priest, and the priests should take precedence sideways according to their rank.

<span id="an58"></span>

## SÛTRA LVIII.

After a sacrificial object has been hallowed by a Mantra, the priest should not toss it about.

<span id="an59"></span>

## SÛTRA LIX.

Sacrificial acts intended for the gods, should be performed by the priest towards the east or towards the north, after he has placed the Brahmanic cord over the left and under the right arm (ya<i>g</i><i>g</i>opavîtin), and turning towards the right.

<span id="an60"></span>

## SÛTRA LX.

Sacrificial acts intended for the Fathers should be performed by the priest towards the south, after he has placed the Brahmanic cord over the right and <span id="p332">[<sup><small>p. 332</small></sup>]</span> under the left arm (prâ<i>k</i>înâvîtin), and turning towards the left.

<span id="an61"></span>

## SÛTRA LXI.

Ropes which have to be joined, should be joined by the priest from left to right, after having tied them from right to left.

<span id="an62"></span>

## SÛTRA LXII.

Ropes which are not joined (single ropes), should be tied by the priest from left to right.

<span id="an62c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The exact process here intended is not quite clear. The ropes seem to have been made of vegetable fibres. See Katy. I, 3,15-17.

<span id="an63"></span>

## SÛTRA LXIII.

Let a man sacrifice with the Amâvâsyâ sacrifice at the time of the Amâvâsyâ, new moon.

<span id="an63c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Amâ-vâsyâ is the dwelling together, i.e. the conjunction, of sun and moon, an astronomical expression which was adopted in the common language of the people at a very early time. It does not occur, however, in the <i>Ri</i>g-veda. In our Sûtra amâvâsyâ is used in the sense both of new moon and new-moon sacrifice.

<span id="an64"></span>

## SÛTRA LXIV.

And let a man sacrifice with the Paur<i>n</i>amâsyâ sacrifice at the time of the Paur<i>n</i>amâsî, full moon, thus it is said.

<span id="an64c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Here the full moon is called paur<i>n</i>amâsî, the sacrifice paur<i>n</i>amâsyâ. Satyavrata joins the two Sûtras in one, and leaves out ya<i>n</i>eteti, which may have belonged to the commentary. <span id="p333">[<sup><small>p. 333</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an65"></span>

## SÛTRA LXV.

Let a man observe that full-moon day as a day of abstinence on which the moon comes out full before.

<span id="an65c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The full moon (paur<i>n</i>amâsî) is really the very moment on which the moon is full and therefore begins to decrease. That moment on which sun and moon are, as the Hindus said, at the greatest distance from each other, is called the parva-sandhi, the juncture of the two phases of the moon. Thus the name of paur<i>n</i>amâsî belongs to the last day of the one and to the first day (pratipad) of the other phase, and both days might be called paur<i>n</i>amâsî. If therefore the moon is full on the afternoon, the evening, or the twilight of one day, that day should be observed as a fast-day, and the next day should be the day of sacrifice.

The meaning of purastâd, which I have translated by before, is doubtful. One commentator says it has no object, and should be dropped, purastâd ity etat padam asmin sûtra idânîm anvaya_m<i> na labhate prayo</i>g_anâbhâvât. Purastâd, before, may, however, mean before the second day, on which the real sacrifice takes place, and the commentator mentions purastât-paur<i> na labhate prayo</i>amâsî as a name of the _k<i> na labhate prayo</i>s_î-yuktâ, i.e. the full moon beginning on the fourteenth day. The same kind of full moon is also called Anumati, Pûrvâ-paur<i> na labhate prayo</i>amâsî, and Sandhyâ-paur<i> na labhate prayo</i>amâsî, while that which takes place on the pratipad, the first day of the lunar phase, is called Râkâ, Uttarâ-paur<i> na labhate prayo</i>amâsî, Astamitoditâ, and _S<i> na labhate prayo</i>h_pûritâ.

Corresponding to these two kinds of Paur<i>n</i>amâsî there are also two kinds of Amâvâsyâ. That which falls on the fourteenth day is called Pûrvâ-amâvâsyâ, or Sinîvâlî, the ἕνη καὶ νέα; that which falls on the pratipad, the first day of the new phase, is called Kuhû, Uttarâ-amâvâsyâ. <i>S</i>voyuktâ. See also Ait.-Brâhm. II, 4; Nir. XI, 31-32. <span id="p334">[<sup><small>p. 334</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an66"></span>

## SÛTRA LXVI.

Or the day when one says, To-morrow it will be full.

<span id="an66c"></span>

**Commentary.**

In that case the day before should be observed as a day of abstinence. The real full moon would then take place in the fore-noon, pûrvâh<i>n</i>e, of the next day. Abstinence, upavâsa, consists in abstaining from meat and from maithuna, in shaving beard and head, cutting the nails, and, what seems a curious provision, in speaking the truth. See Kâty.-<i>S</i>rauta-sûtras II, I, 8-12.

<span id="an67"></span>

## SÛTRA LXVII.

The Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins mention a third, the Kharvikâ full moon.

<span id="an67c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Kharva means small. If one divides the night into twelve parts, and if in a portion of the twelfth part the greatest distance of sun and moon takes place, then the full moon is called kharvikâ, also kshî<i>n</i>â. Or, if on the sixteenth day, the full moon takes place before noon, that also is called kharvikâ paur<i>n</i>amâsî. In that case abstinence or fasting takes place on the sixteenth day (tasyâ_m<i>n</i>d<i>n</i>s<i>n</i>h_). Both paur<i>n</i>amâsîs are also called sadyaskâlâ.

<span id="an68"></span>

## SÛTRA LXVIII.

Let a man observe that new-moon day (amâvâsyâ) as a day of abstinence, on which the moon is not seen.

<span id="an68c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This Sûtra has to be connected with Sûtra LXV. The abstinence takes place on the day, if the actual new moon, the nearest approach of sun and moon, falls on the afternoon, at night, or at twilight. And this new moon, the junction of the fifteenth day and the pratipad, is called Kuhû. We should read amâvâsyâm. <span id="p335">[<sup><small>p. 335</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an69"></span>

## SÛTRA LXIX.

Or the day when one says, To-morrow they will not see it.

<span id="an69c"></span>

**Commentary.**

In that case, when the real new moon takes place in the fore-noon, abstinence is observed on the day before, and the new moon is called Sinîvâlî. Satyavrata reads _s<i>vo yukta iti vâ instead of </i>s<i>vo yukta iti vâ instead of </i>t_âra iti vâ. Drash<i>vo yukta iti vâ instead of </i>âra_h<i>vo yukta iti vâ instead of </i>h_, ‘they will not see it.’ There is much difference of opinion on this subject among different <i>S</i>âkhâs, Sûtrakâras, and their commentators; see Taitt. Sa<i>vo yukta iti vâ instead of </i>h. III, 4, 9; Weber, Ind. Stud., V, p. 228.

<span id="an70"></span>

## SÛTRA LXX.

The principal acts (pradhâna), prescribed in one (typical) performance, follow the same special rules (vidhâna).

<span id="an70c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This Sûtra is variously explained: Satyavrata's commentary, which I have followed in the translation, explains pradhânâni as âgneyâdîni, i.e. the chief parts of such a sacrifice as the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa; vidhânâni as aṅgâni. Kapardisvâmin's commentary also explains vidhânâni as the aṅgâni of a pradhânam; pradhânam as pûr<i>s</i>amâsa, &c. It would therefore mean that such ceremonies as the âgneya (ash<i>s</i>a-kapâla), âgnîshomîya (ekâda<i>s</i>a-kapâla), and upâ<i>s</i><i>s</i>u, which form the pradhânas of the Dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>s</i>amâsa, retain throughout the same vidhânas or aṅgas as prescribed in one Prakara<i>s</i>a, viz. the Dar<i>s</i>apûr<i>s</i>amâsa. The Aṅgas or members are all the things used for sacrificial purposes, milk, butter, grains, animals, &c.

<span id="an71"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXI.

The special rules are limited by (the purpose of) the (typical) performance (prakara<i>n</i>a). <span id="p336">[<sup><small>p. 336</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="an71c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Here the rules (vidhis) are again the Aṅgas, which belong to a sacrifice, as the members belong to the body.

<span id="an72"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXII.

If no special instruction is given (in the <i>S</i>ruti), the acts are general.

<span id="an73"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXIII.

If a special instruction is given, they are restricted.

<span id="an73c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Nirde<i>s</i>a is explained as vi<i>s</i>esha-_s_ruti, and the meaning is supposed to be that unless such a special rule is given, the Aṅgas of all the Pradhâna acts remain the same, as, for instance, the Paryagnikara<i>s</i>a, the Prayâ<i>s</i>as, &c. Special instructions are when it is said: payasâ maitravaru<i>s</i>a_m<i>s</i>n_âti, sruve<i>s</i>a puro<i>s</i>â<i>s</i>am anakti, he cooks the Maitravaru<i>s</i>a with milk, he anoints the Puro<i>s</i>â<i>s</i>a with the spoon, &c.

<span id="an74"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXIV.

The Ash<i>t</i>â-kapâla for Agni, the Ekâda<i>t</i>a-kapâla for Agnî-Shomau, and the Upâ<i>t</i><i>t</i>uyâga (the muttered offering of butter), form the principal acts at the Paur<i>t</i>amâsî, the full moon.

<span id="an74c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Ash<i>t</i>â-kapâla is the cake baked in eight cups, the Ekâda<i>t</i>a-kapâla that baked in eleven cups, and respectively destined for Agni and Soma. What is meant are the sacrificial acts for which these cakes are used.

<span id="an75"></span>

## SÛTRA LXXV.

The other Homas are Aṅga.

<span id="an75c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The other acts, such as the prayâ<i>g</i>as and anuyâ<i>g</i>as, are auxiliary, and have no promise of reward by themselves.
