## PRA<i>S</i>NA I, PA<i>T</i>ALA 1, SECTION 1.

1\. We shall explain the Upanayana (i.e. the initiation of the student).

2\. [^454] Let him initiate a Brâhma<i>n</i>a at the age of seven years,

3\. A Râ<i>g</i>anya, of eleven, a Vai<i>g</i>ya, of twelve.

4\. [^455] A Brâhma<i>n</i>a in the spring, a Râ<i>n</i>anya in the summer, a Vai<i>n</i>ya in the autumn.

5\. In the time of the increasing moon, under an auspicious constellation, preferably (under a constellation) the name of which is masculine,

6\. [^456] He should serve food to an even number of Brâhma<i>n</i>as and should cause them to say, ‘An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!’—

7\. (Then he) should have the boy satiated, should <span id="p138">[<sup><small>p. 138</small></sup>]</span> have his hair shaven, and after (the boy) has bathed and has been decked with ornaments—

8\. He should dress him in a (new) garment which has not yet been washed.

9\. [^457] In a place inclined towards the east, (or) inclined towards the north, (or) inclined towards northeast, or in an even (place), he raises (the surface on which he intends to sacrifice), sprinkles it with water,

10\. Kindles fire by attrition, or fetches common (worldly) fire, puts the fire down, and puts wood on the fire.

11\. [^458] He strews eastward-pointed Darbha grass round the fire;

12\. Or (the grass which is strewn) to the west and to the east (of the fire), may be northward-pointed.

13\. [^459] He (arranges the Darbha blades so as to) lay the southern (blades) uppermost, the northern ones below, if their points are turned (partly) towards the east and (partly) towards the north.

14\. [^460] Having strewn Darbha grass, to the south of the fire, in the place destined for the Brahman,

15\. [^461] Having with the two (verses), ‘I take (the fire) to myself,’ and, ‘The fire which (has entered)’—taken possession of the fire,

16\. [^462] And having, to the north of the fire, spread out Darbha grass, he prepares the (following) objects, <span id="p139">[<sup><small>p. 139</small></sup>]</span> according as they are required (for the ceremony which he is going to perform):

17\. [^463] A stone, a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, a skin (of an antelope, or a spotted deer, &c.), a threefold-twisted girdle of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a grass if he is a Brâhma<i>ñ</i>a (who shall be initiated), a bowstring for a Râ<i>ñ</i>anya, a woollen thread for a Vai<i>ñ</i>ya, a staff of Bilva or of Palâ<i>ñ</i>a wood for a Brâhma<i>ñ</i>a, of Nyagrodha wood for a Râ<i>ñ</i>anya, of Udumbara wood for a Vai<i>ñ</i>ya.

18\. [^464] He binds together the fuel, twenty-one pieces of wood, or as many as there are oblations to be made.

19\. Together with that fuel he ties up the (three) branches of wood which are to be laid round the fire, (which should have the shape of) pegs.

20\. [^465] (He gets ready, besides, the spoon called) Darvî, a bunch of grass, the Â<i>g</i>ya pot, the pot for the Pra<i>n</i>îta water, and whatever (else) is required;

21\. All (those objects) together, or (one after the other) as it happens.

22\. [^466] At that time the Brahman suspends the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, sips water, passes by the fire, on its west side, to the south side, throws away a grass blade from the Brahman's seat, touches water, and sits down with his face turned towards the fire. <span id="p140">[<sup><small>p. 140</small></sup>]</span>

23\. [^467] He takes as ‘purifiers’ two straight Darbha blades with unbroken points of one span's length, cuts them off with something else than his nail, wipes them with water, pours water into a vessel over which he has laid the purifiers, fills (that vessel) up to near the brim, purifies (the water) three times with the two Darbha strainers, holding their points to the north, places (the water) on Darbha grass on the north side of the fire, and covers it with Darbha grass.

24\. [^468] Having consecrated the Proksha<i>n</i>î water by means of the purifiers as before, having placed the vessels upright, and having untied the fuel, he sprinkles (the sacrificial vessels) three times with the whole (Proksha<i>n</i>î water).

25\. [^469] Having warmed the Darvî spoon (over the fire), having wiped it, and warmed it again, he puts it down.

26\. Having besprinkled (with water) the Darbha grass with which the fuel was tied together, he throws it into the fire.

27\. [^470] He melts the Â<i>ya into the Â</i>ya, pours the Â<i>ya into the Â</i>ya into the Â<i>ya into the Â</i>ya pot over which he has laid the purifiers, takes some coals (from the fire) towards the north, puts (the Â<i>ya into the Â</i>ya) on these (coals), throws light (on the <span id="p141">[<sup><small>p. 141</small></sup>]</span> Â<i>ya into the Â</i>ya by means of burning Darbha blades), throws two young Darbha shoots into it, moves a fire-brand round it three times, takes it (from the coals) towards the north, pushes the coals back (into the fire), purifies the Â<i>ya into the Â</i>ya three times with the two purifiers, holding their points towards the north, (drawing them through the Â<i>ya into the Â</i>ya from west to east and) taking them back (to the west each time), throws the two purifiers into the fire,




## PA<i>T</i>ALA 1, SECTION 2.

1\. [^471] And lays the (three) pegs round (the fire).

2\. On the west side (of the fire) he places the middle (peg), with its broad end to the north,

3\. On the south side (of the fire the second peg), so that it touches the middle one, with its broad end to the east,

4\. On the north side (of the fire the third peg), so that it touches the middle one, with its broad end to the east.

5\. To the west of the fire (the teacher who is going to initiate the student), sits down with his face turned towards the east.

6\. To the south (of the teacher) the boy, wearing the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, having sipped water, sits down and touches (the teacher).

7\. [^472] Then (the teacher) sprinkles water round the fire (in the following way):

8\. On the south side (of the fire he sprinkles <span id="p142">[<sup><small>p. 142</small></sup>]</span> water) from west to east with (the words), ‘Aditi! Give thy consent!’—

9\. On the west side, from south to north, with (the words), ‘Anumati! Give thy consent!’ On the north side, from west to east, with (the words), ‘Sarasvatî! Give thy consent!’—

10\. On all sides, so as to keep his right side turned towards (the fire), with (the Mantra), ‘God Savit_ri_! Give thy impulse!’ (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 7, 7, 1).

11\. [^473] Having (thus) sprinkled (water) round (the fire), and having anointed the fuel (with Â<i>g</i>ya), he puts it on (the fire) with (the Mantra), ‘This fuel is thy self, <i>G</i>âtavedas! Thereby thou shalt be inflamed and shalt grow. Inflame us and make us grow; through offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and through the enjoyment of food make us increase. Svâhâ!’

12\. He then sacrifices with the (spoon called) Darvi (the following oblations):

13\. [^474] Approaching the Darvi (to the fire) by the northerly junction of the pegs (laid round the fire), and fixing his mind on (the formula), ‘To Pra<i>g</i>âpati, to Manu svâhâ!’ (without pronouncing that Mantra), he sacrifices a straight, long, uninterrupted (stream of Â<i>g</i>ya), directed towards the south-east.

14\. Approaching the Darvi (to the fire) by the southern junction of the pegs (laid round the fire), <span id="p143">[<sup><small>p. 143</small></sup>]</span> (he sacrifices) a straight (stream of Â<i>g</i>ya), directed towards the northeast, with (the Mantra which he pronounces), ‘To Indra svâhâ!’

15\. Having (thus) poured out the two Âghâra oblations, he sacrifices the two Â<i>g</i>yabhâgas,

16\. [^475] With (the words), ‘To Agni svâhâ!’ over the easterly part of the northerly part (of the fire); with (the words), ‘To Soma svâhâ!’ over the easterly part of the southerly part (of the fire).

17\. [^476] Between them he sacrifices the other (oblations).

18\. [^477] (He makes four oblations with the following Mantras): 'Thou whom we have set to work, <i>G</i>âtavedas! carry forward (our offerings). Agni! Perceive this work (i.e. the sacrifice), as it is performed (by us). Thou art a healer, a creator of medicine. Through thee may we obtain cows, horses, and men. Svâhâ!

‘Thou who liest down athwart, thinking, “It is I who keep (all things) asunder:” to thee who art propitious (to me), I sacrifice this stream of ghee in the fire. Svâhâ!

‘To the propitious goddess svâhâ!

‘To the accomplishing goddess svâhâ!’





<span id="p144">[<sup><small>p. 144</small></sup>]</span>

## PA<i>T</i>ALA 1, SECTION 3.

1\. This is the rite for all Darvi-sacrifices.

2\. [^478] At the end of the Mantras constantly the word Svâhâ (is pronounced).

3\. [^479] (Oblations) for which no Mantras are prescribed (are made merely with the words), ‘To such and such (a deity) svâhâ!’—according to the deity (to whom the oblation is made).

4\. [^480] He sacrifices with the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis, ‘Bhû_h_! Bhuva_h_! Suva_h_!’—with the single (three Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis) and with (the three) together.

5\. [^481] (The Mantras for the two chief oblations are), the (verse), ‘Life-giving, Agni!’ (Taitt. Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 2, 1, 11), (and),

‘Life-giving, O god, choosing long life, thou whose face is full of ghee, whose back is full of ghee, Agni, drinking ghee, the noble ambrosia that comes from the cow, lead this (boy) to old age, as a father (leads) his son. Svâhâ!’

6\. (Then follow oblations with the verses),

‘This, O Varu<i>n</i>a’ (Taitt. Sa<i>n</i>h. II, 1, 11, 6),

‘For this I entreat thee’ (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h., loc. cit.),

<span id="p145">[<sup><small>p. 145</small></sup>]</span>

‘Thou, Agni’ (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 5, 12, 3),

‘Thus thou, Agni’ (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h., loc. cit.),

‘Thou, Agni, art quick. Being quick, appointed (by us) in our mind (as our messenger), thou who art quick, earnest the offering (to the gods). O quick one, bestow medicine on us! Svâhâ!’—(and finally) the (verse),

‘Pra<i>g</i>âpati!’ (Taitt. Sa<i>g</i>h. I, 8, 14, 2).

7\. [^482] (With the verse), ‘What I have done too much in this sacrifice, or what I have done here deficiently, all that may Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, he who knows it, make well sacrificed and well offered for me. To Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, the offerer of well-offered (sacrifices), the offerer of everything, to him who makes us succeed in our offerings and in our wishes, svâhâ!’—he offers (the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t oblation) over the easterly part of the northerly part (of the fire), separated from the other oblations.

8\. [^483] Here some add as subordinate oblations, before the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t, the <i>G</i>aya, Abhyâtâna, and Râsh<i>t</i>rabh<i>t</i>t (oblations).

9\. [^484] The <i>G</i>aya (oblations) he sacrifices with (the thirteen Mantras), ‘Thought, svâhâ! Thinking, svâhâ!’—or, ‘To thought svâhâ! To thinking svâhâ!’ (&c.);

10\. [^485] The Abhyâtâna (oblations) with (the eighteen Mantras), ‘Agni is the lord of beings; may he protect me’ (&c.).

11\. [^486] (The words), ‘In this power of holiness, in <span id="p146">[<sup><small>p. 146</small></sup>]</span> this worldly power (&c.)’ are added to (each section of) the Abhyâtâna formulas.

12\. [^487] With (the last of the Abhyâtâna formulas) ‘Fathers! Grandfathers!’ he sacrifices or performs worship, wearing the sacrificial cord over his right shoulder.

13\. [^488] The Râsh<i>t</i>rabh<i>t</i>t (oblations he sacrifices) with (the twelve Mantras), ‘The champion of truth, he whose law is truth.’ After having quickly repeated (each) section, he sacrifices the first oblation with (the words), ‘To him svâhâ!’ the second (oblation) with (the words), ‘To them svâhâ!’

14\. [^489] Having placed a stone near the northerly junction of the pegs (which are laid round the fire), (the teacher)—




## PA<i>T</i>ALA 1, SECTION 4.

1\. [^490] Makes the boy tread on (that stone) with his right foot, with (the verse), ‘Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Destroy those who seek to do thee harm; overcome thy enemies.’ <span id="p147">[<sup><small>p. 147</small></sup>]</span>

2\. [^491] After (the boy) has taken off his old (garment), (the teacher) makes him put on a (new) garment that has not yet been washed, with (the verses),

‘The goddesses who spun, who wove, who spread out, and who drew out the skirts on both sides, may those goddesses clothe thee with long life. Blessed with life put on this garment.

‘Dress him; through (this) garment make him reach a hundred (years) of age; extend his life. B<i>ri</i>haspati has given this garment to king Soma that he may put it on.

‘Mayst thou live to old age; put on the garment! Be a protector of the human tribes against imprecation. Live a hundred years, full of vigour; clothe thyself in the increase of wealth.’

3\. [^492] Having (thus) made (the boy) put on (the new garment, the teacher) recites over him (the verse),

‘Thou hast put on this garment for the sake of welfare; thou hast become a protector of thy friends against imprecation. Live a hundred long years; a noble man, blessed with life, mayst thou distribute wealth.’

4\. [^493] He then winds the girdle three times from left to right round (the boy, so that it covers) his navel. (He does so only) twice, according to some (teachers). (It is done) with (the verse),

<span id="p148">[<sup><small>p. 148</small></sup>]</span>

‘Here she has come to us who drives away sin, purifying our guard and our protection, bringing us strength by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, the sister of the gods, this blessed girdle.’

5\. On the north side of the navel he makes a threefold knot (in the girdle) and draws that to the south side of the navel.

6\. [^494] He then arranges for him the skin (of an antelope, &c., see Sûtra 7) as an outer garment, with (the Mantras),

‘The firm, strong eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, powerful and flaming, a chaste, mobile vesture, this skin put on, a valiant (man), N.N.!

‘May Aditi tuck up thy garment, that thou mayst study the Veda, for the sake of insight and belief and of not forgetting what thou hast learnt, for the sake of holiness and of holy lustre!’

7\. [^495] The skin of a black antelope (is worn) by a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the skin of a spotted deer by a Râ<i>n</i>anya, the skin of a he-goat by a Vai<i>n</i>ya.

8\. [^496] He then gives him in charge (to the gods), a Brâhma<i>n</i>a with (the verse), ‘We give this (boy) in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great learning. May he (Brahman?) lead him to old age, and may he (the boy) long watch over learning.’

<span id="p149">[<sup><small>p. 149</small></sup>]</span>

A Râ<i>g</i>anya (he gives in charge to the gods) with (the verse), ‘We give this boy in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great royalty. May he lead him to old age, and may he long watch over royalty.’

A Vai<i>s</i>ya (he gives in charge) with (the verse), ‘We give this boy in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great wealth. May he lead him to old age, and may he long watch over wealth.’

9\. [^497] (The teacher) makes him sit down to the west of the fire, facing the north, and makes him eat the remnants of the sacrificial food, with these (Mantras), ‘On thee may wisdom, on thee may offspring’ (Taitt. Âra<i>n</i>yaka, Andhra redaction, X, 44),—altering (the text of the Mantras).

10\. [^498] Some make (the student) eat ‘sprinkled butter.’

11\. (The teacher) looks at (the student) while he is eating, with the two verses, ‘At every pursuit we invoke strong (Indra)’ (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 1, 2, 1), (and), ‘Him, Agni, lead to long life and splendour’ (Taitt: Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 3, 10, 3).

12\. Some make (the boy) eat (that food with these two verses).

13\. [^499] After (the boy) has sipped water, (the teacher) causes him to touch (water) and recites over him (the verse), ‘A hundred autumns are before us, O gods, before ye have made our bodies decay, before (our) <span id="p150">[<sup><small>p. 150</small></sup>]</span> sons have become fathers; do not destroy us before we have reached (our due) age.’

## Footnotes

[^454]: 137:2 1, 2. The statement commonly given in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras and Dharma-sûtras is, that the initiation of a Brâhma<i>ri</i>a shall take place in his eighth year, though there are differences of opinion whether in the eighth year after conception, or after birth (Â<i>ri</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 19, 1. 2). Mât<i>ri</i>datta states that the rule given here in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra refers to the seventh year after birth. In the Dharma-sûtra (comp. Âpastamba I, 1, 18) it is stated that the initiation of a Brâhma<i>ri</i>a shall take place in the eighth year after his conception. Comp. the remarks of Professor Bidder, S.B.E., vol. ii, p. xxiii.

[^487]: 146:12 ‘He performs worship with that Mantra, wearing the sacrificial cord over his right shoulder, to the Manes. According to others, he worships Agni. But this would stand in contradiction to the words (of the Mantra).’ Mât<i>ri</i>datta.

[^488]: 146:13 Taittirîya. Sa<i>m</i>hitâ III, 4, 7. ‘To him’ (tasmai) is masculine, ‘to them’ (tâbhya<i>h</i>) feminine. The purport of these words will be explained best by a translation of the first section of the Râsh<i>m</i>rabh<i>m</i>t formulas: ‘The champion of truth, he whose law is truth, Agni is the Gandharva. His Apsaras are the herbs; “sap” is their name. May he protect this power of holiness and this worldly power. May they protect this power of holiness and this worldly power. To him svâhâ! To them svâhâ!’

[^491]: 147:2 Pâraskara I, 4, 13. 1 2; Atharva-veda II, 13, 2. 3 (XIX, 24). Instead of paridâtavâ u, we ought to read, as the Atharva-veda has, paridhâtavâ u.

[^492]: 147:3 Atharva-veda II, 13, 3; XIX, 24, 6.

[^493]: 147:4 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 2, 1; Pâraskara II, 2, 8. The text of the Mantra as given by Hira<i>n</i>yake<i>n</i>in is very corrupt, but the corruptions may be as old as the Hira<i>n</i>yake<i>n</i>i-sûtra itself, or even older.

[^494]: 148:6 I propose to correct _g<i>arish</i>n<i>arish</i>k<i>arish</i>n_u. See <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 1, 30.

[^495]: 148:7 <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 1, 2. 4. 5, &c.

[^496]: 148:8 In the first hemistich I propose to correct pari dadhmasi into pari dadmasi. The verse seems to be an adaptation of a Mantra which contained a form of the verb pari-dhâ (comp. Atharva-veda XIX, 24, 2); thus the reading pari . . . dadhmasi found in the MSS. may be easily accounted for. The second hemistich is very corrupt, but the Atharva-veda (loc. cit.: yathaina_m<i> </i>g_arase nayât) shows at least the general sense.

[^497]: 149:9 The text of those Mantras runs thus, ‘On me may wisdom, &c.’; he alters them so as to say, ‘On thee,’ &c.
