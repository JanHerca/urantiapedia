## PRA<i>S</i>NA II, PA<i>T</i>ALA 7, SECTION 17.

1\. [^699] We shall explain the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î ceremony.

2\. [^700] On the full-moon day of Mârga<i>ri</i>îrsha he puts wood on the fire, strews (Darbha grass) on the entire surface round the fire, cooks a mess of sacrificial food with milk, sprinkles it (with Â<i>ri</i>ya), takes it from the fire, performs the rites down to the Vyâh<i>ri</i>ti oblations, and sacrifices (four oblations) with (the following Mantras):

‘This offering, the creeping of I<i>d</i>â, rich in ghee, moving and not moving, accept gladly, O <i>G</i>âtavedas. <span id="p240">[<sup><small>p. 240</small></sup>]</span> What domestic animals there are, of all shapes, all seven kinds of them: may they gladly dwell here and may they prosper. Svâhâ!

‘The night which men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night) which is the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us. Svâhâ!

‘Bringing bliss to the cattle, to the wife, bringing bliss by night and by day, may this (night) which is the consort of the year, be auspicious to us. Svâhâ!

‘The full-moon night, bringing abundance, visiting one after another, dividing the months and fortnights: may this (night), the full one, protect us. Svâhâ!’

3\. [^701] He sacrifices the oblation to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>t</i>t with (the verse), ‘Agni, make this (sacrifice) full that it may be well offered. Be victorious, O god, in all battles. Shine far and wide, showing us a wide path. Bestow on us long life, full of splendour and free from decay. Svâhâ!’

4\. Then he washes his hands and touches the earth with (the formulas), 'In power I establish myself, in royalty. Among the horses I establish myself, among the cows. In the limbs I establish myself, in the self. In the Prâ<i>n</i>as I establish myself, in prosperity. In Heaven and Earth I establish myself, in sacrifice.

‘May the three times eleven gods, the thirty-three, the gracious ones, whose Purohita is B<i>ri</i>haspati, on the impulse of the god Savit_ri_—may the gods with (all) the gods give me bliss!’

5\. The master of the house sits down at their southerly end, <span id="p241">[<sup><small>p. 241</small></sup>]</span>

6\. The other persons to the north,

7\. According to their seniority.

8\. They who know the Mantras among them, murmur the Mantras (which will be stated).

9\. With (the verse), ‘Be soft to us, O earth, free from thorns; grant us rest; afford us wide shelter’ (Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 10), and with the two (verses), ‘Verily of the mountains’ (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 2, 12, 2. 3) they lie down on their right sides.

10\. With (the verse), ‘Up! with life’ (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 2, 8, 1) they arise.

11\. When they have arisen, they murmur, ‘We have arisen; we have become immortal.’

12\. In that way they (lie down and) arise that night three times.

13\. [^702] Having served food to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and having caused them to say, ‘An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!’ they rest that night.

End of the Seventh Pa<i>t</i>ala.

[^700]: 239:2 The first Mantra is very corrupt; comp. Atharva-veda III, 10, 6. Regarding the legend of I<i>d</i>â, who was procreated out of Manu's Pala-sacrifice, and ‘came forth as if dripping, and clarified butter gathered on her step,’ comp. <i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>d</i>a I, 8, 1, 7 (M.M., India, what can it teach us? p. 136).

[^701]: 240:3 Comp. Taitt. Br. II, 4, I, 4; Pâraskara III, 1, 3.

[^702]: 241:13 Here end the G<i>ri</i>hya ceremonies,' says Mât<i>ri</i>datta. Dr. Kirste (Preface, p. viii), accordingly, believes that the three last chapters may be later additions. It may be observed in connection with this, that in the Âpastambîya-G<i>ri</i>hya, which throughout is so closely related to our text, the ceremonies of the Upâkara<i>ri</i>a and Utsar<i>ri</i>ana, of which these three chapters treat, are not described.
