## SÛTRA CI.

For these two last portions he makes the indication of the deity.

<span id="an101c"></span>

**Commentary.**

With the earlier portions, there is a rule which of two gods should have the first or the second portion. With the last couple, however, the priest may himself assign whichever portion he likes to one or the other god. The commentary says, svayam eva idam asyâ iti saṅkalpayet.

<span id="an102"></span>

## SÛTRA CII.

When there is a number of <i>K</i>arus and Puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>as, one separates what belongs to the <i>K</i>arus and what belongs to the Puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>as, before the strewing.

<span id="an102c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Prâg adhivapanât, before the strewing, is explained by prâg adhivapanârthak<i>ri</i>sh<i>ri</i>â<i>ri</i>inâdânât, before one takes the black skin which is used for the strewing.

<span id="an103"></span>

## SÛTRA CIII.

One then marks the two (the materials for the Karus and the Puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>as) according to the deities (for whom they are intended).

<span id="an104"></span>

## SÛTRA CIV.

Let the word idam be the rule.

<span id="an104c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This means that the offering (havis) intended for each deity should be pointed out by the words idam, this, Agne_h_, is for Agni, &c. Thus we read with regard to the offerings intended for certain gods and goddesses: ida<i>m</i> Dhâtur, idam Anumatyâ, Râkâyâ<i>m</i> Sinîvâlyâ_h_, Kuhvâ_h_. <span id="p344"><sup><small>[ p. 344 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an105"></span>

## SÛTRA CV.

All this applies also to <i>K</i>arus and Puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>as which are separated.

<span id="an105c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The commentary explains vyatishikta by anyonya<i>m</i> vyavahita, though it is difficult to see how it can have that meaning. It is said that in the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva the <i>K</i>arus and Puro<i>s</i>â<i>s</i>as are vyatishikta, but that they also have to be divided before the adhivapana, and to be marked for each deity. Thus we read: Idam Agne_h_, Savitu_h_, Pûsh<i>s</i>o, Marutâ_m_, Dyâvâp<i>s</i>thivyo_h_, &c.

<span id="an106"></span>

## SÛTRA CVI.

At the time when the Kapâlas are put on the fire, one puts on the karu with the first kapâla verse.

<span id="an106c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Karu is here used for the vessel for boiling the <i>k</i>aru, the <i>k</i>arusthâlî. The first of these verses is dh<i>ri</i>sh<i>ri</i>ir asi. Kapâlas are the jars in which the rice is cooked.

<span id="an107"></span>

## SÛTRA CVII.

The verse is adapted and changed to dhruvoऽsi.

<span id="an107c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Sa<i>m</i>nâma means the same as ûha, i.e. the modification of a verse so as to adapt it to the object for which it is used. In our case, <i>k</i>aru, being a masculine, dh<i>m</i>sh<i>m</i>i, a feminine, is replaced by dhruva, a masculine.

<span id="an108"></span>

## SÛTRA CVIII.

At the time when the meal is to be cleansed, one cleanses the grains.

<span id="an108c"></span>

**Commentary.**

This takes place after the <i>k</i>aru-pot has been put on. The ta<i>nd</i>ulas are the unhusked grains, pish<i>n</i>a is the <span id="p345"><sup><small>[ p. 345 ]</small></sup></span> ground flour. In Sanskrit a distinction is made between <i>k</i>asya, the corn in the field, dhânya, corn with the husk, ta<i>nd</i>ula, grains without husks, anna, roasted grains.

<span id="an109"></span>

## SÛTRA CIX.

At the time of cooking (adhi<i>s</i>rapa<i>s</i>a) one throws the grains in with the cooking verse.

Commentary. This verse is gharmoऽsi.

<span id="an110"></span>

## SÛTRA CX.

Without taking the <i>k</i>aru (out of the sthâlî) one puts it down.

<span id="an111"></span>

## SÛTRA CXI.

At the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifices there are fifteen Sâmidhenîs.

<span id="an111c"></span>

**Commentary.**

Sâmidhenîs are particular verses recited while the fire is being kindled. The first and last verses are repeated thrice, so as to make fifteen in all.

<span id="an112"></span>

## SÛTRA CII.

At the Ish<i>t</i>i and Pa<i>t</i>ubandha sacrifices there are seventeen Sâmidhenîs, when they are so handed down.

<span id="an113"></span>

## SÛTRA CXIII.

When it is said that wishful ish<i>t</i>is are performed in a murmur, this means that the names of the chief deities are pronounced in a murmur (likewise the yâ<i>t</i>yâ and anuvâkyâ).

<span id="an114"></span>

## SÛTRA CXIV.

The Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice is the Prak<i>s</i>ti or norm for all ish<i>s</i>is. <span id="p346"><sup><small>[ p. 346 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="an114c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Sûtras, in describing the performance of certain sacrifices, treat some of them in full detail. These are called prak<i>ri</i>ti. Prak<i>ri</i>yanteऽsmin dharmâ iti prakara<i>ri</i>am prak<i>ri</i>ti_h_. They form the type of other sacrifices, which are therefore looked upon as mere modifications, vik<i>ri</i>ti, and in describing them those points only are fully described in which they differ from their prak<i>ri</i>ti. A sacrifice which is a vik<i>ri</i>ti, may again become the prak<i>ri</i>ti of another sacrifice. This system is no doubt compendious, but it is not free from difficulty, and, in some cases, from uncertainty. It shows how much system there is in the Indian sacrifices, and how fully and minutely that system must have been elaborated, before it assumed that form in which we find it in the Brâhma<i>ri</i>as and Sûtras. It must not be supposed that the sacrifices which serve as prak<i>ri</i>ti, are therefore historically the most ancient.

<span id="an115"></span>

## SÛTRA CXV.

It is also the norm for the Agnîshomîya Pa<i>s</i>u, the animal sacrifice for Agnî-Shomau.

<span id="an116"></span>

## SÛTRA CXVI.

And this is the norm for the Savanîya.

<span id="an117"></span>

## SÛTRA CXVII.

And the Savanîya is the norm for the Aikâda<i>s</i>inas.

<span id="an118"></span>

## SÛTRA CXVIII.

And the Aikâda<i>s</i>inas are the norm for the Pa<i>s</i>uga<i>s</i>as.

<span id="an118c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The rules for the Pa<i>s</i>uga<i>s</i>as are therefore to be taken over from the Aikâda<i>s</i>inas, the Savanîya, the Agnîshomîya-pa<i>s</i>u, and the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa, so far as they have been modified in each particular case, and are <span id="p347"><sup><small>[ p. 347 ]</small></sup></span> finally determined by the rules of each Pa<i>s</i>uga<i>s</i>a, as, for instance, the Âditya-pa<i>s</i>u.

<span id="an119"></span>

## SÛTRA CXIX.

The Vai<i>s</i>vadeva is the norm for the Varu<i>s</i>a-praghâsa, Sâkamedha, and Sîra.

<span id="an119c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, beginning, like the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa, with an Âgneya ash<i>s</i>akapâla, takes certain rules from the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa, and transfers these, together with its own, as, for instance, the nine prayâ<i>s</i>as, to the Varu<i>s</i>a-praghâsa, &c.

<span id="an120"></span>

## SÛTRA CXX.

The Vai<i>s</i>vadevika Ekakapâla is the norm for all Ekakapâlas.

<span id="an120c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The Ekakapâla is a puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>a cake, baked in one kapâla. It is fully described in the Vai<i>d</i>vadeva, and then becomes the norm of all Ekakapâlas. An ekakapâla cake is not divided.

<span id="an121"></span>

## SÛTRA CXXI.

The Vai<i>s</i>vadevî Âmikshâ is the norm for the Âmikshâs (a preparation of milk).

<span id="an122"></span>

## SÛTRA CXXII.

Here the Vikâra, the modification, is perceived from similarity.

<span id="an122c"></span>

**Commentary.**

If it has once been laid down that the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa is the prak<i>s</i>ti or norm for all ish<i>s</i>is, then similarity determines the modification in all details, such as the offerings and the gods to whom offerings are made. Thus Karu, being a vegetable offering, would rank as a vikâra of puro<i>s</i>â<i>s</i>a, which occurs in the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa sacrifice, and is likewise vegetable. Honey and water <span id="p348"><sup><small>[ p. 348 ]</small></sup></span> would be looked upon as most like the Â<i>s</i>ya in the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa. Âmikshâ, a preparation of milk, would come nearest to the Sâ<i>s</i>nâyya, which is a mixture of sour and sweet milk.

<span id="an123"></span>

## SÛTRA CXXIII.

Offerings for one deity are vikâras of the Âgneya.

<span id="an123c"></span>

**Commentary.**

In the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa, which is the prak<i>s</i>ti of the ish<i>s</i>is, the puro<i>s</i>â<i>s</i>a for Agni is meant for one deity. Hence all offerings to one deity in the vik<i>s</i>tis follow the general rules of the Âgneya puro<i>s</i>â<i>s</i>a, as described in the Dar<i>s</i>a-pûr<i>s</i>amâsa, for instance, the karu for Sûrya, the Dvâda<i>s</i>a-kapâla for Sâvitrî.

<span id="an124"></span>

## SÛTRA CXXIV.

Offerings for two deities are vikâras of the Agnîshomîya.

<span id="an124c"></span>

**Commentary.**

They must, however, be vegetable offerings, because the puro<i>d</i>â<i>d</i>a for Agnî-Shomau is a vegetable offering. As an instance, the Âgnâvaish<i>d</i>ava Ekâda<i>d</i>akapâla is quoted. Agnîshomîya has a short a, but the first a in âgnavaish<i>d</i>ava is long.

<span id="an125"></span>

## SÛTRA CXXV.

Offerings for many deities are vikâras also of the Aindrâgna.

<span id="an125c"></span>

**Commentary.**

The _k<i>a in bahudevatâ</i>s<i>a in bahudevatâ</i>k<i>a in bahudevatâ</i>n_ava also. Any offering intended for more than one deity may be considered as intended for many deities.
