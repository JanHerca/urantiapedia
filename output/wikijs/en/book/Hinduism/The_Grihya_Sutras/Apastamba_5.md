3\. [^763] At noon, after (the ceremonies) from the putting (of wood) on the fire down to the Â<i>s</i>yabhâga oblations (have been performed), he puts a piece of Palâ<i>s</i>a wood on (the fire) with the next (verse; M. II, 7, 1), sits down to the west of the fire on a mat or on erakâ grass, recites the next (verse, II, 7, 2) over a razor, and hands it over to the barber with the next Ya<i>s</i>us (II, 7, 3). (The rites) beginning with the pouring together of (warm and cold) water down to the burying of the hair are the same as above (comp. M. II, 7, 4).

4\. He sits down behind the cow-shed, takes the girdle off, and hands it over to a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin.

5\. The (Brahma<i>k</i>ârin) hides it with the next Ya<i>k</i>us (II, 7, 5) at the root of an Udumbara tree or in a tuft of Darbha grass.

With the next (verse, II, 7, 16) he moves about a gold pellet with its setting, which is strung on a string, three times from left to right in a water-pot; with the next (verse, II, 7, 17) he ties the (pellet) to his neck; in the same way, without Mantras, he ties a pellet of Bâdara wood to his left hand, and repeats the rites stated above with a fresh upper garment, with the (verses), ‘May the rich’ (comp. above, IV, 10, 10; M. II, 7, 18).
