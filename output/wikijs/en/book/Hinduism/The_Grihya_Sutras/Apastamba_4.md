9\. [^757] After (the boy) has bathed, and (the ceremonies) from the putting (of wood) on (the fire) down to the Â<i>s</i>yabhâga oblations (have been performed), he causes him to put a piece of Palâ<i>s</i>a wood on the <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> fire with the next (verse; M.

## Footnotes

[^755]: 271:6 10, 6, 7. The difference which Haradatta makes between the teacher who begins to shave him (pravapati) and the barber who goes on with shaving (vapantam) seems too artificial.

[^756]: 271:7 Haradatta: The teacher addresses the barber, &c.—Sudar<i>s</i>anârya: The mother of the boy or a Brahma<i>s</i>ârin \[comp. Sûtra 8\] . . . addresses the teacher who shaves him.

[^757]: 271:9 Comp. above, II, 4, 3.

[^758]: 272:11 Comp. Âpast. Dharma-sûtra I, I, 2, 33; I, 3, 3 seq.

[^759]: 272:12 As to the words, ‘he initiates him’ (upanayati), comp. <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana II, 2, 11. 12; Â<i>s</i>valâyana I, 20, 4 &c.

[^760]: 273:5 11, 5. See above, Section 10, Sûtra 9.

[^761]: 274:16 16, 17. These Sûtras are identical with Dharma-sûtra I, 1, 2, 38 (S.B.E., vol. ii, p. 9).

[^762]: 275:26 The garment which the teacher takes for himself is that mentioned above, IV, 10, 10.
