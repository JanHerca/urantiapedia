SECOND ADHYÂYA [^652].

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Sthavira <i>S</i>âkalya said that breath is the beam [^653], and as the other beams rest on the house-beam, thus the eye, the ear, the mind, the speech, the senses, the body, the whole self rests on this [^654] breath.

2\. Of that self the breathing is like the sibilants, the bones like the mutes, the marrow like the vowels, and the fourth part, flesh, blood, and the rest, like the semivowels [^655],—so said Hrasva Mâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ûkeya.

3\. To us it was said to be a triad only [^656].

4\. Of that triad, viz. bones, marrow, and joints, there are 360 (parts) on this side (the right), and 360 on that side (the left). They make 720 together, and 720 [^657] are the days and nights of the year. Thus that self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech is like unto the days.

5\. He who thus knows this self, which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech, as like unto the days, obtains union, likeness, or nearness with the days, has sons and cattle, and lives his full age.

<span id="p258"><sup><small>[ p. 258 ]</small></sup></span>

## SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Next comes Kau<i>n</i><i>th</i>aravya:

2\. There are 360 syllables (vowels), 360 sibilants (consonants), 360, groups.

3\. What we called syllables are the days, what we called sibilants are the nights, what we called groups are the junctions of days and nights. So far with regard to the gods (the days).

4\. Now with regard to the body. The syllables which we explained mythologically, are physiologically the bones; the sibilants which we explained mythologically, are physiologically the marrow.

5\. Marrow is the real breath (life), for marrow is seed, and without breath (life) seed is not sown. Or when it is sown without breath (life), it will decay, it will not grow.

6\. The groups which we explained mythologically, are physiologically the joints.

7\. Of that triad, viz. bones, marrow, and joints, there are 540 (parts) on this side (the right), and 540 on that side (the left). They make 1080 together, and 1080 are the rays of the sun. They make the B<i>ri</i>hatî verses and the day (of the Mahâvrata) [^658].

8\. Thus that self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech is like unto the syllables.

9\. He who knows this self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech, as like unto syllables, obtains union, likeness, or nearness with the syllables, has sons and cattle, and lives his full age.


<span id="p259"><sup><small>[ p. 259 ]</small></sup></span>

## THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Bâdhva [^659] says, there are four persons (to be meditated on and worshipped).

2\. The person of the body, the person of the metres, the person of the Veda, and the Great person.

3\. What we call the person of the body is this corporeal self. Its essence is the incorporeal conscious self.

4\. What we call the person of the metres is this collection of letters (the Veda). Its essence is the vowel a.

5\. What we call the person of the Veda is (the mind) by which we know the Vedas, the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, and Sâma-veda. Its essence is Brahman [^660](m.)

6\. Therefore let one chose a Brahman-priest who is full of Brahman (the Veda), and is able to see any flaw in the sacrifice.

7\. What we call the Great person is the year, which causes some beings to fall together, and causes others to grow up. Its essence is yonder sun.

8\. One should know that the incorporeal conscious self and yonder sun are both one and the same. Therefore the sun appears to every man singly (and differently).

9\. This has also been declared by a <i>Ri</i>shi (Rv. I, 115, 1):—

10\. ‘The bright face of the gods arose, the eye of Mitra, Varu<i>n</i>a, and Agni; it filled heaven and earth <span id="p260"><sup><small>[ p. 260 ]</small></sup></span> and the sky,—the sun is the self of all that rests and moves.’

11\. ‘This I think to be the regular Sa<i>m</i>hitâ as conceived by me,’ thus said Bâdhva.

12\. For the Bahv<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as consider him (the self) in the great hymn (mahad uktha), the Adhvaryus in the sacrificial fire, the <i>Kh</i>andogas in the Mahâvrata ceremony. Him they see in this earth, in heaven, in the air, in the ether, in the water, in herbs, in trees, in the moon, in the stars, in all beings. Him alone they call Brahman.

13\. That self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech is like unto the year.

14\. He who recites to another that self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech, and is like unto the year,

## FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. To him the Vedas yield no more milk, he has no luck in what he has learnt (from his Guru); he does not know the path of virtue.

2\. This has also been declared by a <i>Ri</i>shi (Rv. X, 71, 6):—

3\. ‘He who has forsaken the friend (the Veda), that knows his friends, in his speech there is no luck. Though he hears, he hears in vain, for he does not know the path of virtue.’

4\. Here it is clearly said that he has no luck in what he has learnt, and that he does not know the path of virtue.

5\. Therefore let no one who knows this, lay the sacrificial fire (belonging to the Mahâvrata) for another, let him not sing the Sâmans of the Mahâvrata <span id="p261"><sup><small>[ p. 261 ]</small></sup></span> for another, let him not recite the Sastras of that day for another.

6\. However, let him willingly do this for a father or for an Â<i>k</i>ârya; for that is done really for himself.

7\. We have said that the incorporeal conscious self and the sun are one [^661]. When these two become separated [^662], the sun is seen as if it were the moon [^663]; no rays spring from it; the sky is red like madder; the patient cannot retain the wind, his head smells bad like a raven's nest:—let him know then that his self (in the body) is gone, and that he will not live very long [^664].

8\. Then whatever he thinks he has to do,. let him do it, and let him recite the following hymns: Yad anti ya<i>k</i> <i>k</i>a dûrake (Rv. IX, 67, 21-27); Ad it pratnasya retasa<i>h</i> (Rv. VIII, 6, 30); Yatra brahmâ pavamâna (Rv. IX, 113, 6-11); Ud vaya<i>m</i> tamasas pari (Rv. I, 50, 10).

9\. Next, when the sun is seen pierced, and seems like the nave of a cart-wheel, when he sees his own shadow pierced, let him know then that it is so (as stated before, i. e. that he is going to die soon).

10\. Next, when he sees himself in a mirror or in the water with a crooked head, or without a head [^665], or when his pupils are seen inverted [^666] or not straight, let him know then that it is so. <span id="p262"><sup><small>[ p. 262 ]</small></sup></span> 11\. Next, let him cover his eyes and watch, then threads are seen as if falling together [^667]. But if he does not see them, let him know then that it is so.

12\. Next, let him cover his ears and listen, and there will be a sound as if of a burning fire or of a carriage [^668]. But if he does not hear it, let him know then that it is so.

13\. Next, when fire looks blue like the neck of a peacock [^669], or when he sees lightning in a cloudless sky, or no lightning in a clouded sky, or when he sees as it were bright rays in a dark cloud, let him know then that it is so.

14\. Next, when he sees the ground as if it were burning, let him know that it is so.

15\. These are the visible signs (from 7-14).

16\. Next come the dreams [^670].

17\. If he sees a black man with black teeth, and that man kills him; or a boar kills him; a monkey jumps on [^671] him; the wind carries him along quickly; having swallowed gold he spits it out [^672]; he eats honey; he chews stalks; he carries a red lotus; he drives with asses and boars; wearing a wreath of red flowers (naladas) he drives a black cow with a black calf, facing the south [^673],

18\. If a man sees any one of these (dreams), let <span id="p263"><sup><small>[ p. 263 ]</small></sup></span> him fast, and cook a pot of milk, sacrifice it, accompanying each oblation with a verse of the Râtri hymn (Rv. X, 12 7), and then, after having fed the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, with other food (prepared at his house) eat himself the (rest of the) oblation.

19\. Let him know that the person within all beings, not heard here [^674], not reached, not thought, not subdued, not seen, not understood, not classed, but hearing, thinking, seeing, classing, sounding, understanding, knowing, is his Self.

## FIFTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^675]

1\. Now next the Upanishad of the whole speech.

True all these are Upanishads of the whole speech, but this they call so (chiefly).

2\. The mute consonants represent the earth, the sibilants the sky, the vowels heaven.

The mute consonants represent Agni (fire), the sibilants air, the vowels the sun.

The mute consonants represent the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, the sibilants the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, the vowels the Sâma-veda.

The mute consonants represent the eye, the sibilants the ear, the vowels the mind.

The mute consonants represent the up-breathing, the sibilants the down-breathing, the vowels the back-breathing.

3\. Next comes this divine lute (the human body, made by the gods). The lute made by man is an imitation of it.

4\. As there is a head of this, so there is a head of that (lute, made by man). As there is a stomach <span id="p264"><sup><small>[ p. 264 ]</small></sup></span> of this, so there is the cavity [^676] (In the board) of that. As there is a tongue of this, so there is a tongue [^677] in that. As there are fingers of this, so there are strings of that [^678]. As there are vowels of this, so there are tones of that. As there are consonants of this, so there are touches of that. As this is endowed with sound and firmly strung, so that is endowed with sound and firmly strung. As this is covered with a hairy skin, so that is covered with a hairy skin.

5\. Verily, in former times they covered a lute with a hairy skin.

6\. He who knows this lute made by the Devas (and meditates on it), is willingly listened to, his glory fills the earth, and wherever they speak Âryan languages, there they know him.

7\. Next follows the verse, called vâgrasa, the essence of speech. When a man reciting or speaking in an assembly does not please, let him say this verse:

8\. ‘May the queen of all speech, who is covered, as it were, by the lips, surrounded by teeth, as if by spears, who is a thunderbolt, help me to speak well.’ This is the vâgrasa, the essence of speech.

## SIXTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Next K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a-Hârita [^679] confided this Brâhma<i>n</i>a [^680] concerning speech to him (his pupil): <span id="p265"><sup><small>[ p. 265 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the year, after having sent forth all creatures, burst. He put himself together again by means of <i>kh</i>andas (Vedas). Because he put himself together again by means of <i>kh</i>andas, therefore (the text of the Veda) is called Sa<i>m</i>hitâ (put together).

3\. Of that Sa<i>m</i>hitâ the letter <i>n</i> is the strength, the letter sh the breath and self (Âtman).

4\. He who knows the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses and the letters <i>n</i> and sh for every Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, he knows the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ with strength and breath. Let him know that this is the life of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ.

5\. If the pupil asks, 'Shall I say it with the letter <i>n</i> or without it? 'let the teacher say, ‘With the letter <i>n</i>.’ And if he asks, ‘Shall I say it with the letter sh or without it?’ let the teacher say, ‘With the letter sh [^681].’

6\. Hrasva Mâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ûkeya said: ‘If we here recite the verses according to the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ (attending to the necessary changes of n and s into <i>n</i> and sh [^682]), and if we say the adhyâya of Mâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ûkeya (Ait. Âr. III, 1), then the letters <i>n</i> and sh (strength and breath) have by this been obtained for us.’

7\. Sthavira Sâkalya said: ‘If we recite the verses according to the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, and if we say the adhyâya of Mâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ûkeya, then the letters <i>n</i> and sh have by this been obtained for us.’

8\. Here the <i>Ri</i>shis, the Kâvasheyas [^683], knowing <span id="p266"><sup><small>[ p. 266 ]</small></sup></span> this, said: ‘Why should we repeat (the Veda), why should we sacrifice? We offer as a sacrifice breath in speech, or speech in breath. What is the beginning (of one), that is the end (of the other).’

9\. Let no one tell these Sa<i>m</i>hitâs (Ait. Âr. III, 1-III, 2) to one who is not a resident pupil, who has not been with his teacher at least one year, and who is not himself to become an instructor [^684]. Thus say the teachers, yea, thus say the teachers.

, and then rest in another place finishing it.

11\. 'And in the place where he reads this, he should not read p. 268 anything else, though he may read this (the Mahâvrata) where he has read something else.

12\. 'No one should bathe and become a snâtaka [^690] who does not read this. Even if he has read many other things, he should not become a snâtaka if he has not read this.

13\. 'Nor should he forget it, and even if he should forget anything else, he should not forget this.

14\. 'No, he should never forget this.

15\. 'If he does not forget this, it will be enough for himself (or for acquiring a knowledge of the Self).

16\. 'It is enough, let him know this to be true.

17\. ‘Let him who knows this not communicate, nor dine, nor amuse himself with any one who does not know it.’

Then follow some more rules as to the reading of the Veda in general:

18\. 'When the old water that stood round the roots of trees is dried up (after about the month of Pausha, January to February [^691]) he should not read; nor (at any time) in the morning or in the afternoon, when the shadows meet (he should begin at sunrise so soon as the shadows divide, and end in the evening before they fall together). Nor should he read [^692] when a cloud has risen; and when there is an unseasonable rain (after the months of Srâva<i>n</i>a and Bhâdrapada, August and September [^693]) he should stop his Vedic reading for three nights. Nor should he at that time tell stories, not even during the night, nor should he glory in his knowledge.

19\. ‘This (the Veda thus learnt and studied) is the name of that Great Being; and he who thus knows the name of that Great Being, he becomes Brahman, yea, he becomes Brahman.’

## Footnotes

[^654]: 257:1 In the first adhyâya meditations suggested by sa<i>m</i>hitâ, pada, and krama have been discussed. Now follow meditations suggested by certain classes of letters.

[^655]: 257:2 Ait. Âr. III, 1, 4.

[^656]: 257:3 The Kashmir MS. reads etasmin prâ<i>n</i>e. The self here is meant for the body, and yet it seems to be different from <i>s</i>arîra.

[^657]: 257:4 The Kashmir MS. writes antastha without visarga, while it is otherwise most careful in writing all sibilants.

[^658]: 257:5 <i>S</i>âkalya, as we saw, told his disciples that there were three classes only, not four. Comm. The Kashmir MS. reads traya<i>m</i> tv eva na ityetat proktam.

[^659]: 257:6 The Kashmir MS, reads sapta vi<i>m</i><i>s</i>ati<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a <i>s</i>atâni.

[^660]: 258:1 There are in the Mahâvrata eighty tristichs of B<i>ri</i>hatîs, and as each B<i>ri</i>hatî is decreed to consist of thirty-six syllables, ten would give 360 syllables, and three times ten, 1080. Comm.

[^661]: 259:1 Instead of Bâdhya, the commentary and the Kashmir MS. read Bâdhva.

[^662]: 259:2 Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, with whom he who knows the Veda becomes identified. Comm

[^663]: 261:1 Ait. Âr. III, 2, 3, 8.

[^664]: 261:2 This separation of the self of the sun and the conscious self within us is taken as a sign of approaching death, and therefore a number of premonitory symptoms are considered in this place.

[^665]: 261:3 ἥλιος μηνοειδής Xen. Hist. gr. 4, 3, 10.

[^666]: 261:4 The Kashmir MS. reads <i>g</i>îvayishyati.

[^667]: 261:5 The Kashmir MS. reads <i>g</i>ihma<i>s</i>irasa<i>m</i> vâ<i>s</i>arîram âtmânam.

[^668]: 261:6 A white pupil in a black eye-ball. Comm.

[^669]: 262:1 The Kashmir MS. reads ba<i>t</i>irakâ<i>n</i>i sampatantîva.

[^670]: 262:2 See <i>Kh</i>. Up. III, 13, 8. The Kashmir MS. and the commentary give the words rathasyevopabdis, which are left out in the printed text.

[^671]: 262:3 The Kashmir MS. reads mayûragrîvâ ameghe.

[^672]: 262:4 The Kashmir MS. reads svapna<i>h</i>.

[^673]: 262:5 The Kashmir MS. reads âskandati.

[^674]: 262:6 The Kashmir MS. reads avagirati.

[^675]: 262:7 The commentator separates the last dream, so as to bring their number to ten.

[^676]: 263:1 The Kashmir MS. reads sa yata<i>s</i> <i>s</i>ruto.

[^677]: 263:2 After having inserted the preceding chapter on omina and the concluding paragraph on the highest knowledge, he now returns to the meditation on the letters.

[^678]: 264:1 The Kashmir MS. reads udara evam, &c.

[^679]: 264:2 Vâdanam, what makes the instrument speak, hastena. Comm.

[^680]: 264:3 Here the order is inverted in the text.

[^681]: 264:4 One of the sons of Harita, who was dark. Comm.

[^682]: 264:5 Brâhma<i>n</i>a, in the sense of Upanishad, this secret doctrine or explanation. It forms an appendix, like the svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t at the end of a sacrifice. ‘Iva,’ which the commentator explains as restrictive or useless, may mean, something like a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.

[^683]: 265:1 The letters n and sh refer most likely to the rules of <i>n</i>atva and shatva, i. e. the changing of n and s into <i>n</i> and sh.

[^684]: 265:2 If we know whenever n and s should be changed to <i>n</i> and sh in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ.

[^685]: 265:3 The Kâvasheyas said that, after they had arrived at the highest knowledge of Brahman (through the various forms of meditation and worship that lead to it and that have been described in the Upanishad) no further meditation and no further sacrifice could be p. 266 required. Instead of the morning and evening stoma they offer breath in speech, whenever they speak, or speech in breath, when they are silent or asleep. When speech begins, breathing ceases; when breathing begins, speech ceases.

[^686]: 266:1 The strict prohibition uttered at the end of the third Âra<i>n</i>yaka, not to divulge a knowledge of the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ-upanishad (Ait. Âr. III, 1-2), as here explained, is peculiar. It would have seemed self-evident that, like the rest of the <i>s</i>ruti or sacred literature, the Âra<i>n</i>yaka too, and every portion of it, could have been learnt from the mouth of a teacher only, and according to rule (niyamena), i. e. by a pupil performing all the duties of a student (brahma<i>k</i>ârin [^686]), so that no one except a regular pupil (antevâsin) could possibly gain access to it. Nor can there be any doubt that we ought to take the words asa<i>m</i>vatsaravâsin and apravakt<i>ri</i> as limitations, and to translate, ‘Let no one tell these Sa<i>m</i>hitâs to any pupil who has not at least been a year with his master, and who does not mean to become a teacher in turn.’
  That this is the right view is confirmed by similar injunctions given at the end of the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka. Here we have first some rules as to who is qualified to recite the Mahâvrata. No one is permitted to do so, who has not passed through the Dîkshâ, the initiation for the Agnish<i>t</i>oma. If the Mahâvrata is performed as a Sattra, the sacrificer is a Hotri priest, and he naturally has passed through that ceremony. But if the Mahâvrata is performed as an Ekâha or Ahîna ceremony, anybody might be the sacrificer, and therefore it was necessary to say that no one who is adîkshita, uninitiated, should recite it for another person; nor should he do so, p. 267 when the Mahâvrata is performed without (or with) an altar, or if it does not last one year. In saying, however, that one should not recite the Mahâvrata for another person, parents and teachers are not to be understood as included, because what is done for them, is done for ourselves.
  After these restrictions as to the recitation of the Mahâvrata, follow other restrictions as to the teaching of it, and here we read, as at the end of the Upanishad:
  4\. ‘Let no one teach this day, the Mahâvrata, to one who is not a regular pupil (antevâsin), and has been so for one year, certainly not to one who has not been so for one year; nor to one who is not a brahma<i>k</i>ârin and does not study the same Veda [^687], certainly not to one who does not study the same Veda; nor to one who does not come to him.
  5\. ‘Let the teaching not be more than saying it once or twice, twice only.
  6\. ‘One man should tell it to one man, so says <i>G</i>âtukar<i>n</i>ya.
  7\. ‘Not to a child, nor to a man in his third stage of life.
  8\. ‘The teacher and pupil should not stand, nor walk, nor lie down, nor sit on a couch; but they should both sit on the ground.
  9\. ‘The pupil should not lean backward while learning, nor lean forward. He should not be covered with too much clothing, nor assume the postures of a devotee, but without using any of the apparel of a devotee, simply elevate his knees. Nor should he learn, when he has eaten flesh, when he has seen blood, or a corpse, or when he has done an unlawful thing [^688]; when he has anointed his eyes, oiled or rubbed his body, when he has been shaved or bathed, put colour on, or ornamented himself with flower-wreaths, when he has been writing or effacing his writing [^689].
  10\. ‘Nor should he finish the reading in one day, so says <i>G</i>âtukar<i>n</i>ya, while according to Gâlava, he should finish it in one day. Âgnive<i>s</i>yâyana holds that he should finish all before the Trikâ<i>s</i>îtis [^685]
