SECOND ADHYÂYA.

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^396].

1\. The two t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, Rv. VIII, 68, 1-3, â tvâ ratha<i>m</i> yathotaye, and Rv. VIII, 2, 1-3, ida<i>m</i> vaso sutam andha<i>h</i>, form the first (pratipad) and the second (anu<i>k</i>ara) of the Marutvatîya hymn.

2\. Both, as belonging to the one-day ceremonial [^397], are perfect in form. On that day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites this hymn [^398].

3\. In the second verse of (the Pragâtha [^399]), indra nedîya ed ihi, pra sû tirâ sa<i>k</i>îbhir ye ta ukthina<i>h</i> (Rv. VIII, 53, 5, 6), there occurs the word ukthina<i>h</i>, reciters of hymns [^400]. Verily, this day (the mahâvrata) is an uktha (hymn), and as endowed with an uktha, the form of this day is perfect.

4\. In the first verse (of another Pragâtha) the word vîra, strong, occurs (Rv. I, 40, 3), and as endowed with the word vîra, strong, the form of this day is perfect. <span id="p167"><sup><small>[ p. 167 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. In the second verse (of another Pragâtha) the word suvîryam, strength, occurs (Rv. I. 40, 1), and as endowed with the word suvîrya, strength, the form of this day is perfect.

6\. In the first verse (of another Pragâtha) the word ukthyam, to be hymned, occurs (Rv. I, 40, 5). Verily, this day is an uktha, and as endowed with an uktha, the form of this day is perfect.

7\. In the (Dhayyâ) verse agnir netâ (Rv. III, 2 0, 4) the word v<i>ri</i>trahâ, killer of V<i>ri</i>tra, occurs. The killing of V<i>ri</i>tra is a form (character) of Indra, this day (the mahâvrata) belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.

8\. In the (Dhayyâ) verse tva<i>m</i> soma kratubhi<i>h</i> sukratur bhû<i>h</i> (Rv. I, 91, 2) the word v<i>ri</i>shâ [^401], powerful, occurs. Powerful is a form (character) of Indra, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.

9\. In the (Dhayyâ) verse pinvanty apa<i>h</i> (Rv. I, 64, 6) the word vâ<i>g</i>inam, endowed with food, occurs. Endowed with food is a form (character) of Indra, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.

10\. In the same verse the word stanayantam, thundering, occurs. Endowed with thundering is a form (character) of Indra, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.

11\. In (the Pragâtha) pra va indrâya b<i>ri</i>hate (Rv. VIII, 89, 3) (the word b<i>ri</i>hat occurs). Verily, b<i>ri</i>hat is mahat (great), and as endowed with mahat, great, the form of this day (mahâvrata) is perfect.

12\. In (the Pragâtha) b<i>ri</i>had indrâya gâyata (Rv. VIII, 89, 1) <span id="p168"><sup><small>[ p. 168 ]</small></sup></span> (the word b<i>ri</i>hat occurs). Verily, b<i>ri</i>hat is mahat (great), and as endowed with mahat, the form of this day is perfect.

13\. In (the Pragâtha) naki<i>h</i> sudâso ratham pary âsa na rîramad (Rv. VII, 32, 10) the words paryâsa (he moved round) and na rîramad (he did not enjoy) occur, and as endowed with the words paryasta and rânti the form of this day is perfect [^402].

He recites all (these) Pragâthas, in order to obtain all the days (of the sacrifice), all the Ukthas [^403], all the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as [^404], all the <i>S</i>astras [^405], all the Pra-ugas [^406], and all the Savanas (libations).

## SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^407].

1\. He recites the hymn, asat su me <i>g</i>arita<i>h</i> sâbhivega<i>h</i> (Rv. X, 27, 1), (and in. it the word) satyadhv<i>ri</i>tam, the destroyer of truth. Verily, that day <span id="p169"><sup><small>[ p. 169 ]</small></sup></span> is truth, and as endowed with the word satya, truth, the form of this day is perfect [^408].

2\. That hymn is composed by Vasukra. Verily, Vasukra is Brahman, and that day is Brahman. Thus he obtains Brahman by means of Brahman [^409].

3\. Here they say: ‘Why then is that Marutvatîya, hymn completed by the hymn of Vasukra?’ Surely because no other <i>Ri</i>shi but Vasukra brought out a Marutvatîya hymn, or divided it properly [^410]. Therefore that Marutvatîya hymn is completed by the hymn of Vasukra.

4\. That hymn, asat su me, is not definitely addressed to any deity, and is therefore supposed to be addressed to Pra<i>g</i>âpati. Verily, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is indefinite, and therefore the hymn serves to win Pra<i>g</i>âpati.

5\. Once in the hymn (Rv. X, 27, 22) he defines Indra (indrâya sunvat); therefore it does not fall off from its form, as connected with Indra.

6\. He recites the hymn (Rv. VI, 17, 1) pibâ somam abhi yam ugra tarda<i>h</i>.

7\. In the verse ûrvam gavyam mahi g<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âna indra the word mahi, great, occurs. Endowed with the word mahat, the form of this day is perfect.

8\. That hymn is composed by Bharadvâ<i>g</i>a, and Bharadvâ<i>g</i>a was he who knew most, who lived longest, and performed the greatest austerities among the <i>Ri</i>shis, and by this hymn he drove away evil. Therefore if he recites the hymn of Bharadvâ<i>g</i>a, <span id="p170"><sup><small>[ p. 170 ]</small></sup></span> then, after having driven away evil, he becomes learned, long-lived, and full of austerities.

9\. He recites the hymn kayâ subhâ savayasa<i>h</i> sanîlâ<i>h</i> (Rv. I, 165, 1).

10\. In the verse â <i>s</i>âsate prati haryanty ukthâ (Rv. I, 165, 4) the word uktha occurs. Verily, that day (the mahâvrata) is uktha (hymn). Endowed with the word uktha, the form of this day becomes perfect.

11\. That hymn is called Kayâ<i>s</i>ubhîya [^411]. Verily, that hymn, which is called Kayâ<i>s</i>ubhîya, is mutual understanding and it is lasting. By means of it Indra, Agastya, and the Maruts came to a mutual understanding. Therefore, if he recites the Kayâ<i>s</i>ubhîya hymn, it serves for mutual understanding.

12\. The same hymn is also long life. Therefore, if the sacrificer is dear to the Hot<i>ri</i>, let him recite the Kayâ<i>s</i>ubhîya hymn for him.

13\. He recites the hymn marutvâ<i>n</i> indra v<i>ri</i>shabo ra<i>n</i>âya (Rv. III, 47, 1).

14\. In it the words indra v<i>ri</i>shabha (powerful) occur. Verily, powerful is a form of Indra [^412], this day belongs to Indra, and this is the perfect form of that day.

15\. That hymn is composed by Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra. Verily, Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra was the friend (mitra) of all (vi<i>s</i>va).

16\. Everybody is the friend of him who knows this, and for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites this hymn.

17\. The next hymn, <i>g</i>anish<i>th</i>â ugra<i>h</i> sahase turâya (Rv. I, 73, 1), forms a Nividdhâna [^413], and, <span id="p171"><sup><small>[ p. 171 ]</small></sup></span> according to the one-day (ekâha) ceremonial, is perfect in form. On that day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for (by recitation of hymns). Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year (on the last day but one of the sacrifice that lasts a whole year) the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest.

He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites this hymn [^414].

18\. These, if recited straight on, are ninety-seven verses [^415]. The ninety are three Virâ<i>g</i>, each consisting of thirty, and then the seven verses which are over. Whatever is the praise of the seven, is the praise of ninety also. <span id="p172"><sup><small>[ p. 172 ]</small></sup></span> 19\. By repeating the first and last verses three times each, they become one hundred and one verses.

20\. There are five fingers, of four joints each, two pits (in the elbow and the arm), the arm, the eye, the shoulder-blade; this makes twenty-five. The other three parts have likewise twenty-five each [^416]. That makes a hundred, and the trunk is the one hundred and first.

21\. Hundred is life, health, strength, brightness. The sacrificer as the one hundred and first rests in life, health, strength, and brightness.

22\. These verses become Trish<i>t</i>ubh [^417], for the noonday-libation consists of Trish<i>t</i>ubh verses.

## THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^418].

1\. They say: ‘What is the meaning of preṅkha, swing?’ Verily, he is the swing, who blows (the wind). He indeed goes forward (pra + iṅkhate) in these worlds, and that is why the swing is called preṅkha.

2\. Some say, that there should be one plank, because the wind blows in one way, and it should be like the wind.

3\. That is not to be regarded.

4\. Some say, there should be three planks, because there are these three threefold worlds, and it should be like them. <span id="p173"><sup><small>[ p. 173 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. That is not to be regarded.

6\. Let there be two, for these two worlds (the earth and heaven) are seen as if most real, while the ether (space) between the two is the sky (antariksha). Therefore let there be two planks.

7\. Let them be made of Udumbara wood. Verily, the Udumbara tree is sap and eatable food, and thus it serves to obtain sap and eatable food.

8\. Let them be elevated in the middle (between the earth and the cross-beam). Food, if placed in the middle, delights man, and thus he places the sacrificer in the middle of eatable food.

9\. There are two kinds of rope, twisted towards the right and twisted towards the left. The right ropes serve for some animals, the left ropes for others. If there are both kinds of rope, they serve for the attainment of both kinds of cattle.

10\. Let them be made of Darbha (Ku<i>s</i>a grass), for among plants Darbha is free from evil, therefore they should be made of Darbha grass.


## FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Some say: ‘Let the swing be one ell (aratni) above the ground, for by that measure verily the Svarga worlds are measured.’ That is not to be regarded.

2\. Others say: ‘Let it be one span (prâde<i>s</i>a), for by that measure verily the vital airs were measured.’ That is not to be regarded [^419].

3\. Let it be one fist (mush<i>t</i>i), for by that measure verily all eatable food is made, and by that measure <span id="p174"><sup><small>[ p. 174 ]</small></sup></span> all eatable food is taken; therefore let it be one fist above the ground.

4\. They say: ‘Let him mount the swing from east to west, like he who shines; for the sun mounts these worlds from east to west.’ That is not to be regarded.

5\. Others say: ‘Let him mount the swing sideways, for people mount a horse sideways [^420], thinking that thus they will obtain all desires.’ That is not to be regarded.

6\. They say: ‘Let him mount the swing [^421] from behind, for people mount a ship from behind, and this swing is a ship in which to go to heaven.’ Therefore let him mount it from behind.

7\. Let him touch the swing with his chin (<i>kh</i>ubuka). The parrot (<i>s</i>uka) thus mounts a tree, and he is of all birds the one who eats most food. Therefore let him touch it with his chin.

8\. Let him mount the swing with his arms [^422]. The hawk swoops thus on birds and on trees, and he is of all birds the strongest. Therefore let him mount with his arms.

9\. Let him not withdraw one foot (the right or left) from the earth, for fear that he may lose his hold.

10\. The Hot<i>ri</i> mounts the swing, the Udgât<i>ri</i> the seat made of Udumbara wood. The swing is masculine, the seat feminine, and they form a union. Thus he makes a union at the beginning of the uktha in order to get offspring.

<span id="p175"><sup><small>[ p. 175 ]</small></sup></span>

He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.

12\. Next the swing is food, the seat fortune. Thus he mounts and obtains food and fortune.

13\. The Hotrakas (the Prasâst<i>ri</i>, Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>_kh<i>a</i>m_sin, Pot<i>ri</i>, Nesh<i>t</i>ri, Agnâdhra, and A<i>k</i><i>kh</i>âvâka) together with the Brahman sit down on cushions made of grass, reeds, leaves, &c.

14\. Plants and trees, after they have grown up, bear fruit. Thus if the priests mount on that day altogether (on their seats), they mount on solid and fluid as their proper food. Therefore this serves for the attainment of solid as proper food [^423].

15\. Some say: 'Let him descend after saying vasha<i>t</i> [^424]. 'That is not to be regarded. For, verily, that respect is not shown which is shown to one who does not see it [^425].

16\. Others say: ‘Let him descend after he has taken the food in his hand.’ That is not to be regarded. For, verily, that respect is not shown which is shown to one after he has approached quite close.

17\. Let him descend after he has seen the food. For, verily, that is real respect which is shown to one when he sees it. Only after having actually <span id="p176"><sup><small>[ p. 176 ]</small></sup></span> seen the food (that is brought to the sacrifice), let him descend from the swing.

18\. Let him descend turning towards the east, for in the east the seed of the gods springs up [^426]. Therefore let him rise turning towards the east, yea, turning towards the east.

## Footnotes

[^398]: 166:1 In the first adhyâya the two hymns to be recited by the Hot<i>ri</i> priest at the morning-libation (the â<i>g</i>ya and pra-uga <i>s</i>astra) have been considered. Now follows the Marutvatîya hymn, to be recited by the Hot<i>ri</i> priest at the noon-libation.

[^399]: 166:2 Taken from the Agnish<i>t</i>oma.

[^400]: 166:3 Cf. I, 1, 3, 7-8.

[^401]: 166:4 All these Pragâthas consist of two verses expanded into a t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>a.

[^402]: 166:5 Hotrâdaya ukthina<i>h</i> <i>s</i>astri<i>n</i>a<i>h</i>.

[^403]: 167:1 Cf. I, 2, 2, 14.

[^404]: 168:1 Because the performance of the Mahâvrata sacrifice moves the worshipper round to another world and gives him enjoyment. Comm. It is difficult to surpass the absurdity of these explanations. Na rîramat means no one stopped the chariot of Sudâs. But even if it meant that no one rejoiced through the chariot of Sudâs, it would be difficult to see how the negative of enjoyment, mentioned in the hymn, could contribute to the perfection of a sacrifice which is to confer positive enjoyment on the worshipper.

[^405]: 168:2 The stotras following after the Ya<i>g</i>ñâya<i>g</i>ñîya Sâman, serving for the ukthya-kratus.

[^406]: 168:3 The stotras of the noon-libation, to be performed with the Rathantara, B<i>ri</i>hat, and other Sâmans.

[^407]: 168:4 The <i>s</i>astras, recitations, accompanying the oblations of â<i>g</i>ya.

[^408]: 168:5 The pra-ugas, a division of <i>s</i>astras, described above.

[^409]: 168:6 The type after which the Marutvatîya-<i>s</i>astra is to be performed is the <i>K</i>aturvi<i>m</i>sa day. Hitherto (from â tvâ ratham to naki<i>h</i> sudâsa<i>h</i>), all that is taken over from the type to the modification, i. e. the Marutvatîya, has been explained. Now follow the verses which are new and peculiar to the Marutvatîya of the Mahâvrata.

[^410]: 169:1 The commentator endeavours to make the meaning more natural by taking in the word prahantâ, he who kills the destroyer of truth. But considering the general character of these remarks, this is hardly necessary.

[^411]: 169:2 Cf. I, 1, 3, 3.

[^412]: 169:3 By separating the first t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>a from the second, and so forth.

[^413]: 170:1 Cf. Ait. Brâhm. V, 16.

[^414]: 170:2 Cf. Ait. Âr. II, 2, 1, 8.

[^415]: 170:3 The hymn consists of eleven verses. In the middle, after the sixth verse, nivids or invocations, such as indro marutvân, are inserted, and therefore it is called a nividdhâna hymn.

[^416]: 171:1 With this hymn the Marutvatîya-<i>s</i>astra is finished. All the hymns from â tvâ ratham to asat su me <i>g</i>aritar are simply taken over from the <i>K</i>aturvi<i>m</i>sa ceremonial, the rest are peculiar to the Mahâvrata day, the day preceding the Udayanîya or final day of the Gavâmayana sattra. All this is more fully described in the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka (V, 1, 1, 8), containing the Sûtras or rules of <i>S</i>aunaka, while the earlier Âra<i>n</i>yakas are reckoned as Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and are therefore mixed up with matters not actually required for the performance of the sacrifice.

[^417]: 171:2 The first Stotriya and Ânurûpa t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as = 6 (I, 2, 1, 1).
  The six Pragâthas, each of 2 verses raised to 3 (but the text gives seven Pragâthas) = 18 (I, 2, 1, 3; 4; 5; 6; 11; 12; 13).
  Three Dhâyyâs = 3 (I, 2, 1, 7; 8; 9).
  Asat su = 24 (I, 2, 2, 1).
  Pibâ somam = 15 (I,2,2,6).
  Kayâ <i>s</i>ubhâ = 15 (I, 2,2,9).
  Marutvâ<i>n</i> indra = 5 (I, 2, 2, 13).
  <i>G</i>anish<i>th</i>â ugra<i>h</i> = 11 (1, 2, 2, 17).
  (TOTAL) 97

[^418]: 172:1 The left side as well as the right, and then the left and right side of the lower body. Thus we have twenty joints of the five toes, a thigh, a leg, and three joints, making twenty-five on each side.

[^419]: 172:2 Approach the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre of the last hymn. Comm.

[^420]: 172:3 After having considered the Marutvatîya, he proceeds to consider the Nishkevalya. This has to be recited by the Hot<i>ri</i> while sitting on a swing.

[^421]: 173:1 They rise one span above the heart, and they proceed one span from out the mouth. Comm.

[^422]: 174:1 Here we have clearly riding on horseback.

[^423]: 174:2 While the swing points to the east, let him stand west, and thus mount.

[^424]: 174:3 The fore-arms, from the elbow to the end, the aratnî. Comm.

[^425]: 175:1 One expects isha<i>h</i> before ûr<i>g</i>a<i>h</i>, but it is wanting in both text and commentary, and in other MSS. also.

[^426]: 175:2 The word by which the Hot<i>ri</i> invites the Adhvaryu to offer the oblation to the gods. The descending from the swing belongs, of course, to a later part of the sacrifice.

[^427]: 175:3 it is supposed that the Hot<i>ri</i> rises from the swing to show respect to the sacrificial food, when it is brought near. But as it is not brought near, immediately after the Hot<i>ri</i> has finished his part with the word vasha<i>t</i>, the food could not see the Hot<i>ri</i> rise, and this mark of respect, intended for the food, would thus be lost.

[^428]: 176:1 Should it be devareta<i>h</i> sampra<i>g</i>âyate, or devaretasam pra<i>g</i>âyate?
