FIRST ÂRA<i>N</i>YAKA.

FIRST ADHYÂYA.

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Now follows the Mahâvrata ceremony.

2\. After having killed V<i>ri</i>tra, Indra became great. When he became great, then there was the Mahâvrata (the great work). This is why the Mahâvrata ceremony is called Mahâvrata.

3\. Some people say: ‘Let the priest make two (recitations with the offering of the) â<i>g</i>ya (ghee) on that day,’ but the right thing is one [^377].

4\. He who desires prosperity should use the hymn, pra vo devâyâgnaye (Rv. III, 13, 1).

5\. He who desires increase should use the hymn, vi<i>s</i>o vi<i>s</i>o atithim (Rv. VIII, 74, 1). <span id="p158">[<sup><small>p. 158</small></sup>]</span> 6\. The people (visa<i>h</i>) indeed are increase [^378], and therefore he (the sacrificer) becomes increased.

7\. But (some say), there is the word atithim (in that hymn, which means a guest or stranger, asking for food). Let him not therefore take that hymn. Verily, the atithi (stranger) is able [^379] to go begging.

8\. ‘No,’ he said, 'let him take that hymn.

9\. 'For he who follows the good road and obtains distinction, he is an atithi (guest) [^380].

10\. 'They do not consider him who is not so, worthy to be (called) an atithi (guest).

11\. ‘Therefore let him by all means take that hymn.’

12\. If he takes that hymn, let him place the (second) tristich, âganma v<i>ri</i>trahantamam, ‘we came near to the victorious,’ first.

13\. For people worship the whole year (performing the Gavâmayana sacrifice) wishing for this day (the last but one)—they do come near.

14\. The (next following) three tristichs begin with an Anush<i>t</i>ubh [^381]. Now Brahman is Gâyatrî, speech is Anush<i>t</i>ubh. He thus joins speech with Brahman.

15\. He who desires glory should use the hymn, abodhy agni<i>h</i> samidhâ ganânâm (Rv. V, 1, 1). <span id="p159">[<sup><small>p. 159</small></sup>]</span> 16\. He who desires offspring and cattle should use the hymn, hotâ<i>g</i>anishta <i>k</i>etana<i>h</i> (Rv. II, 5, 1).




## SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. He who desires proper food [^382] should use the hymn, agnim naro dîdhitibhi<i>h</i> (Rv. VII, 1, 1) [^383].

2\. Verily, Agni (fire) is the eater of food.

In the other (recitations accompanying the) offerings of â<i>g</i>ya (where Agni is likewise mentioned) the worshippers come more slowly near to Agni (because the name of Agni does not stand at the beginning of the hymn). But here a worshipper obtains proper food at once, he strikes down evil at once.

3\. Through the words (occurring in the second foot of the first verse), hasta<i>k</i>yuti <i>g</i>anayanta, ‘they caused the birth of Agni by moving their arms,’ the hymn becomes endowed with (the word) birth. Verily, the sacrificer is born from this day of the sacrifice, and therefore the hymn is endowed with (the word) birth.

4\. There are four metrical feet (in the Trish<i>t</i>ubh verses of this hymn). Verily, cattle have four feet, therefore they serve for the gaining of cattle.

5\. There are three metrical feet (in the Virâ<i>g</i>, verses of this hymn). Verily, three are these three-fold <span id="p160">[<sup><small>p. 160</small></sup>]</span> worlds. Therefore they serve for the conquest of the worlds.

6\. These (the Trish<i>t</i>ubh and Virâ<i>g</i> verses of the hymn) form two metres, which form a support (pratish<i>th</i>â). Verily, man is supported by two (feet), cattle by four feet. Therefore this hymn places the sacrificer who stands on two feet among cattle which stand on four.

7\. By saying them straight on there are twenty-five verses in this hymn. Man also consists of twenty-five. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk (âtman) the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-fifth, by this hymn.

8\. And then this day (of the sacrifice) consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five [^384] (verses); it becomes the same through the same. Therefore these two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five [^385].

9\. These twenty-five verses, by repeating the first thrice and the last thrice, become thirty less one. This is a Virâ<i>g</i>, verse (consisting of thirty syllables), too small by one. Into the small (heart) the vital spirits are placed, into the small stomach food is placed [^386], therefore this Virâ<i>g</i>, small by one, serves for the obtainment of those desires.

10\. He who knows this, obtains those desires.

11\. The verses (contained in the hymn agnim naro dîdhitibhi<i>h</i>) become the B<i>ri</i>hatî [^387] metre and <span id="p161">[<sup><small>p. 161</small></sup>]</span> the Virâ<i>g</i> metre, (they become) the perfection which belongs to that day (the mahâvrata). Then they also become Anush<i>t</i>ubh [^388], for the offerings of â<i>g</i>ya (ghee) dwell in Anush<i>t</i>ubhs [^389].





### THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^390].

1\. Some say: ‘Let him take a Gâyatrî hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Gâyatrî is brightness and glory of countenance, and thus the sacrificer becomes bright and glorious.’

2\. Others say: ‘Let him take a Ush<i>n</i>ih hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Ush<i>n</i>ih is life, and thus the sacrificer has a long life.’

Others say: ‘Let him take an Anush<i>t</i>ubh hymn <span id="p162">[<sup><small>p. 162</small></sup>]</span> for the Pra-uga. Verily, Anush<i>t</i>ubh is valour, and it serves for obtaining valour.’

Others say: ‘Let him take a B<i>ri</i>hatî hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, B<i>ri</i>hatî is fortune, and thus the sacrificer becomes fortunate.’

Others say: ‘Let him take a Paṅkti hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Paṅkti is food, and thus the sacrificer becomes rich in food.’

Others say: ‘Let him take a Trish<i>t</i>ubh hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Trish<i>t</i>ubh is strength, and thus the sacrificer becomes strong.’

Others say: ‘Let him take a <i>G</i>agatî hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, cattle is <i>G</i>agatî-like, and thus the sacrificer becomes rich in cattle.’

But we say: 'Let him take a Gâyatrî hymn only. Verily, Gâyatrî is Brahman, and that day (the mahâvrata) is (for the attainment of) Brahman. Thus he obtains Brahman by means of Brahman.

4\. 'And it must be a Gâyatrî hymn by Madhu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>andas,

5\. 'For Madhu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>andas is called Madhu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>andas, because he wishes (<i>kh</i>andati) for honey (madhu) for the <i>Ri</i>shis.

6\. 'Now food verily is honey, all is honey, all desires are honey, and thus if he recites the hymn of Madhu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>andas, it serves for the attainment of all desires.

7\. ‘He who knows this, obtains all desires.’

This (Gâyatrî pra-uga), according to the one-day (ekâha) ceremonial [^391], is perfect in form [^392]. On that day (the mahâvrata) much is done now and then which <span id="p163">[<sup><small>p. 163</small></sup>]</span> has to be hidden [^393], and has to be atoned for y recitation of hymns). Atonement (<i>s</i>ânti) is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year (on the last day but one of the sacrifice that lasts a whole year) the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest.

8\. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites this hymn.





### FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^394].

1\. Rv. I, 2, 1-3. Vâyav â yâhi dar<i>s</i>ateme somâ ara<i>m</i> k<i>ri</i>tâ<i>h</i>, ‘Approach, O Vâyu, conspicuous, these Somas have been made ready.’ Because the word ready occurs in these verses, therefore is this day (of the sacrifice) ready (and auspicious) for the sacrificer and for the gods.

2\. Yes, this day is ready (and auspicious) to him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.

3\. Rv. I, 2, 4-6. Indravâyû ime sutâ, â yâtam upa nishk<i>ri</i>tam, ‘Indra and Vâyu, these Somas are prepared, come hither towards what has been prepared.’ By nishk<i>ri</i>ta, prepared, he means what has been well prepared (sa<i>m</i>sk<i>ri</i>ta).

4\. Indra and Vâyu go to what has been prepared by him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites. <span id="p164">[<sup><small>p. 164</small></sup>]</span> 5\. Rv. I, 2, 7. Mitra<i>m</i> huve pûtadaksham, dhiya<i>m</i> gh<i>ri</i>tâkî<i>m</i> sâdhantâ, ‘I call Mitra of holy strength; (he and Varu<i>n</i>a) they fulfil the prayer accompanied with clarified butter.’ Verily, speech is the prayer accompanied with clarified butter.

6\. Speech is given to him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.

7\. Rv. I, 3, 1. A<i>s</i>vinâ ya<i>g</i>varîr isha<i>h</i>, ‘O A<i>s</i>vinau, (eat) the sacrificial offerings.’ Verily, the sacrificial offerings are food, and this serves for the acquirement of food.

8\. Rv. I, 3, 3. Â yâta<i>m</i> rudravartanî, ‘Come hither, ye Rudravartanî.’

9\. The Asvinau go to the sacrifice of him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.

10\. Rv. I, 3, 4-6. Indrâ yâhi <i>k</i>itrabhâno, indrâ yâhi dhiyeshita<i>h</i>, indrâ yâhi tûtu<i>g</i>âna, ‘Come hither, Indra, of bright splendour, Come hither, Indra, called by prayer, Come hither, Indra, quickly!’ Thus he recites, Come hither, come hither!

11\. Indra comes to the sacrifice of him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.

12\. Rv. I, 3, 7. Omâsa<i>s</i> <i>k</i>arsha<i>n</i>îdh<i>ri</i>to vi<i>s</i>ve devâsa â gata, ‘Vi<i>s</i>ve Devas, protectors, supporters of men, come hither!’

13\. Verily, the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devas come to the call of him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.

14\. Rv. I, 3, 7. Dâsvâ<i>m</i>so dâ<i>s</i>usha<i>h</i> sutam, ‘Come ye givers to the libation of the giver!’ By dâ<i>s</i>usha<i>h</i> he means dadusha<i>h</i>, i. e. to the libation of every one that gives. <span id="p165">[<sup><small>p. 165</small></sup>]</span> 15\. The gods fulfil his wish, with whatever wish he recites this verse,

16\. (The wish of him) who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.

17\. Rv. I, 3, 10. Pâvakâ na<i>h</i> sarasvatî ya<i>g</i>ña<i>m</i> vash<i>t</i>u dhiyâvasu<i>h</i>, ‘May the holy Sarasvatî accept our sacrifice, rich in prayer!’ Speech is meant by ‘rich in prayer.’

18\. Speech is given to him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.

19\. And when he says, ‘May she accept our sacrifice!’ what he means is, ‘May she carry off our sacrifice!’

20\. If these verses are recited straight on, they are twenty-one. Man also consists of twenty-one. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, and the trunk the twenty-first. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-first, by this hymn [^395].

21\. By repeating the first and the last verses thrice, they become twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the twenty-fifth. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-fifth, by this hymn'.

Now this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five: it becomes the same through the same. Therefore these two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five, yea, twenty-five.

## Footnotes

[^379]: 157:1 That it should be one only is proved from the types, i. e. from other sacrifices, that have to be followed in the performance of the Mahâvrata. The first type is the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, where one <i>s</i>astra is enjoined as â<i>g</i>ya<i>s</i>astra, viz. pra vo devâyâgnaye. In the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it, which has to follow the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, another hymn is put in its place, viz. agni<i>m</i> naro dîdhitibhi<i>h</i>. In the Mahâvrata, which has to follow the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it, some people recommend the use of both these hymns. But that is wrong, for there must be in the sacrifices which follow the Agnish<i>t</i>oma twelve <i>s</i>astras altogether; and if there were two here, instead of one, we should get a total of thirteen.

[^380]: 158:1 The word visa<i>h</i>, which occurs in the hymn, means people. The commentator says that because the Vai<i>s</i>yas or tradespeople increase their capital, therefore they are called increase.

[^381]: 158:2 Able, or liable; cf. Ait. Âr. II, 3, 5, 7.

[^382]: 158:3 Atithi is here explained by yo bhavati, and bhavati is explained as walking on the good road. One expects yo vâ atati. The obtaining of distinction is probably derived from ati, above, in atithi.

[^383]: 158:4 In the first and second the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is followed by two Gâyatrîs.

[^384]: 159:1 Annâdyam is always explained as food, here as annam tad âdya<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a. It must be so translated here and elsewhere (1, 2, 10), though it is often an abstract of annâda, an eater of food, a healthy man.

[^385]: 159:2 This hymn is prescribed in the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it sacrifice, and taken over to the Mahâvrata, according to rule. It is used, however, both as obligatory and as optional at the same time, i. e. it is an essential part of the sacrifice, and at the same time to be used by those who wish for proper food.

[^386]: 160:1 Cf. Ait. Âr. I, 1, 4, 21; II, 3, 4, 2.

[^387]: 160:2 The plural after the dual is explained by the fact that the hymn means the twenty-five verses.

[^388]: 160:3 Cf. I, 3, 7, 5.

[^389]: 160:4 The hymn consists of eighteen Virâ<i>g</i> and seven Trish<i>t</i>ubh p. 161 verses. Therefore the eighteen Virâ<i>g</i> verses remain what they are, only that the first is repeated three times, so that we have twenty Virâ<i>g</i> verses. The seven Trish<i>t</i>ubhs, by repeating the last three times, become nine. We then take eight syllables away from each verse, thus changing them into nine B<i>ri</i>hatî verses. The nine times eight syllables, which were taken off, give us seventy-two syllables, and as each B<i>ri</i>hatî consists of thirty-six syllables, two B<i>ri</i>hatîs.

[^390]: 161:1 The change of the first verse, which is a Virâ<i>g</i> of thirty-three syllables, into an Anush<i>t</i>ubh is produced by a still easier process. The first Virâ<i>g</i> consists here of thirty-three syllables, the Anush<i>t</i>ubh should have thirty-two. But one or two syllables more or less does not destroy a metre, according to the views of native metricians. The Virâ<i>g</i> itself, for instance, should have thirty syllables, and here has thirty-three. Therefore if changed into an Anush<i>t</i>ubh, it simply has one syllable over, which is of no consequence. Comm.

[^391]: 161:2 Cf. Ait. Âr. I, 1, 1, 4.

[^392]: 161:3 Thus far the hymn which has to be recited by the Hot<i>ri</i> priest, after the eating of the <i>ri</i>tugrabas, has been considered. What follows next is the so-called Pra-uga hymn, consisting of seven t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, which the Hot<i>ri</i> has to recite after the Vi<i>s</i>vedevagraha. Different <i>S</i>âkhâs recommend hymns of different metres, our <i>S</i>âkhâ fixes on the Gâyatrî.

[^393]: 162:1 It is copied from the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it, and that from the Agnish<i>t</i>oma.

[^394]: 162:2 Nothing is wanting for its performance, if one only follows the rules given in the Agnish<i>t</i>oma.

[^395]: 163:1 Dâsîn<i>ri</i>tya-bahubhûtamaithuna-brahma<i>k</i>âripu<i>m</i><i>s</i><i>k</i>alîsampravâ-dâdikam. See Rajendralal Mitra, Introduction to his edition of the Aitareya-âra<i>n</i>yaka, p. 25. It might be better to join ekâha<i>h</i> with <i>s</i>ântyâm, but even then the argumentation is not quite clear.

[^396]: 163:2 Next follows a list of the verses which form the seven t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as (groups of three verses) of the Pra-uga hymn, with occasional remarks on certain words.

[^397]: 165:1 Cf. I, 1, 2, 7; I, 3, 5, 7.
