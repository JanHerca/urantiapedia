SEVENTH PRAPÂ<i>TH</i>AKA.

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Nârada approached Sanatkumâra and said, ‘Teach me, Sir!’ Sanatkumâra said to him: ‘Please to tell me what you know; afterward I shall tell you what is beyond.’

2\. Nârada said: 'I know the Rig-veda, Sir, the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, the Sâma-veda, as the fourth the Âtharva<i>n</i>a, as the fifth the Itihâsa-purâ<i>n</i>a (the Bhârata); the Veda of the Vedas (grammar); the Pitrya (the rules for the sacrifices for the ancestors); the Râ<i>s</i>i (the science of numbers); the Daiva (the science of portents); the Nidhi (the science of time); the Vâkovâkya (logic); the Ekâyana (ethics); the Deva-vidyâ (etymology); the Brahma-vidyâ (pronunciation, <i>s</i>ikshâ, ceremonial, kalpa, prosody, <i>kh</i>andas); the Bhûta-vidyâ (the science of demons); the Kshatra-vidyâ <span id="p110">[<sup><small>p. 110</small></sup>]</span> (the science of weapons); the Nakshatra-vidyâ (astronomy); the Sarpa and Deva<i>g</i>ana-vidyâ (the science of serpents or poisons, and the sciences of the genii, such as the making of perfumes, dancing, singing, playing, and other fine arts) [^300]. All this I know, Sir.

3\. ‘But, Sir, with all this I know the Mantras only, the sacred books, I do not know the Self. I have heard from men like you, that he who knows the Self overcomes grief. I am in grief. Do, Sir, help me over this grief of mine.’

Sanatkumâra, said to him: 'Whatever you have read, is only a name.

4\. 'A name is the Rig-veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, Sâma-veda, and as the fourth the Âtharvana, as the fifth the Itihâsa-purâ<i>n</i>a, the Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the Râ<i>s</i>i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vâkovâkya, the Ekâyana, the Deva-vidyâ, the Brahma-vidyâ, the Bhûta-vidyâ, the Kshatra-vidyâ, the Nakshatra-vidyâ, the Sarpa and Devagana-vidyâ. All these are a name only. Meditate on the name.

5\. ‘He who meditates on the name as Brahman [^301], <span id="p111">[<sup><small>p. 111</small></sup>]</span> is, as it were, lord and master as far as the name reaches-he who meditates on the name as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than a name?’

‘Yes, there is something better than a name.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Speech is better than a name. Speech makes us understand the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, Sâma-veda, and as the fourth the Âtharvana, as the fifth the Itihâsa-purâ<i>n</i>a, the Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the Râ<i>s</i>i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vâkovâkya, the Ekâyana, the Deva-vidyâ, the Brahma-vidyâ, the Kshatra-vidyâ, the Nakshatra-vidyâ, the Sarpa and Deva<i>g</i>ana-vidyâ; heaven, earth, air, ether, water, fire, gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants; what is right and what is wrong; what is true and what is false; what is good and what is bad; what is pleasing and what is not pleasing. For if there were no speech, neither right nor wrong would be known [^302], neither the true nor the false, neither the good nor the bad, neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant. Speech makes us understand all this. Meditate on speech.

2\. ‘He who meditates on speech as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as far as speech reaches he who meditates on speech as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than speech

‘Yes, there is something better than speech.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


<span id="p112">[<sup><small>p. 112</small></sup>]</span>

## THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Mind (manas) is better than speech. For as the closed fist holds two amalaka or two kola or two aksha fruits, thus does mind hold speech and name. For if a man is minded in his mind to read the sacred hymns, he reads them; if he is minded in his mind to perform any actions, he performs them; if he is minded to wish for sons and cattle, he wishes for them; if he is minded to wish for this world and the other, he wishes for them. For mind is indeed the self [^303], mind is the world, mind is Brahman. Meditate on the mind.

2\. ‘He who meditates on the mind as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as far as the mind reaches—he who meditates on the mind as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than mind?’

‘Yes, there is something better than mind.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Will [^304] (saṅkalpa) is better than mind. For when a man wills, then he thinks in his mind, then he sends forth speech, and he sends it forth in a name. In a name the sacred hymns are contained, in the sacred hymns all sacrifices.

2\. 'All these therefore (beginning with mind and <span id="p113">[<sup><small>p. 113</small></sup>]</span> ending in sacrifice) centre in will, consist of will, abide in will. Heaven and earth willed, air and ether willed, water and fire willed. Through the will of heaven and earth &c. rain wills; through the will of rain food wills; through the will of food the vital airs will; through the will of the vital airs the sacred hymns will; through the will of the sacred hymns the sacrifices will; through the will of the sacrifices the world (as their reward) wills; through the will of the world everything wills [1](sbe01139.htm#fn_305). This is will. Meditate on will.

3\. ‘He who meditates on will as Brahman, he, being himself safe, firm, and undistressed, obtains the safe, firm, and undistressed worlds which he has willed; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as will reaches—he who meditates on will as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than will?’

‘Yes, there is something better than will.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## FIFTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Consideration (<i>k</i>itta) [^306] is better than will. For when a man considers, then he wills, then he thinks in his mind, then he sends forth speech, and he <span id="p114">[<sup><small>p. 114</small></sup>]</span> sends it forth in a name. In a name the sacred hymns are contained, in the sacred hymns all sacrifices.

2\. 'All these (beginning with mind and ending in sacrifice) centre in consideration, consist of consideration, abide in consideration. Therefore if a man is inconsiderate, even if he possesses much learning, people say of him, he is nothing, whatever he may know; for, if he were learned, he would not be so inconsiderate. But if a man is considerate, even though he knows but little, to him indeed do people listen gladly. Consideration is the centre, consideration is the self, consideration is the support of all these. Meditate on consideration.

3\. ‘He who meditates on consideration as Brahman, he, being himself safe, firm, and undistressed, obtains the safe, firm, and undistressed worlds which he has considered; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as consideration reaches—he who meditates on consideration as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than consideration?’

‘Yes, there is something better than consideration.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## SIXTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Reflection (dhyâna) [^307] is better than consideration. The earth reflects, as it were, and thus does the sky, the heaven, the water, the mountains, gods and men. Therefore those who among men obtain <span id="p115">[<sup><small>p. 115</small></sup>]</span> greatness here on earth, seem to have obtained a part of the object of reflection (because they show a certain repose of manner). Thus while small and vulgar people are always quarrelling, abusive, and slandering, great men seem to have obtained a part of the reward of reflection. Meditate on reflection.

2\. ‘He who meditates on reflection as Brahman, is lord and master, as it were, as far as reflection reaches—he who meditates on reflection as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than reflection?’

‘Yes, there is something better than reflection.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## SEVENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Understanding (vi<i>g</i>ñâna) is better than reflection. Through understanding we understand the Rig-veda, the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, the Sâma-veda, and as the fourth the Âtharvana, as the fifth the Itihâsa-purâ<i>n</i>a [^308], the Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the Râ<i>s</i>i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vâkovâkya, the Ekâyana, the Deva-vidyâ, the Brahma-vidyâ, the Bhûta-vidyâ, the Kshatra-vidyâ, the Nakshatra-vidyâ, the Sarpa and Deva<i>g</i>ana-vidyâ, heaven, earth, air, ether, water, fire, gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants; what is right and what is wrong; what is true and what is false; what is good and what is bad; what is pleasing and what is not pleasing; food and savour, this world and that, all this we understand through understanding. Meditate on understanding.

2\. ‘He who meditates on understanding as Brahman, reaches the worlds where there is understanding <span id="p116">[<sup><small>p. 116</small></sup>]</span> and knowledge [^309]; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as understanding reaches—he who meditates on understanding as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than understanding?’

‘Yes, there is something better than understanding.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## EIGHTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Power (bala) is better than understanding. One powerful man shakes a hundred men of understanding. If a man is powerful, he becomes a rising man. If he rises, he becomes a man who visits wise people. If he visits, he becomes a follower of wise people. If he follows them, he becomes a seeing, a hearing, a perceiving, a knowing, a doing, an understanding man. By power the earth stands firm, and the sky, and the heaven, and the mountains, gods and men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants; by power the world stands firm. Meditate on power.

2\. ‘He who meditates on power as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as far as power reaches—he who meditates on power as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than power?’

‘Yes, there is something better than power.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## NINTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Food (anna) is better than power. Therefore if a man abstain from food for ten days, though he live, he would be unable to see, hear, perceive, think, act, and understand. But when he obtains <span id="p117">[<sup><small>p. 117</small></sup>]</span> food, he is able to see, hear, perceive, think, act, and understand. Meditate on food.

2\. ‘He who meditates on food as Brahman, obtains the worlds rich in food and drink; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as food reaches—he who meditates on food as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than food

‘Yes, there is something better than food.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## TENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Water (ap) is better than food. Therefore if there is not sufficient rain, the vital spirits fail from fear that there will be less food. But if there is sufficient rain, the vital spirits rejoice, because there will be much food. This water, on assuming different forms, becomes this earth, this sky, this heaven, the mountains, gods and men, cattle, birds, herbs and trees, all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants. Water indeed assumes all these forms. Meditate on water.

2\. ‘He who meditates on water as Brahman, obtains all wishes, he becomes satisfied; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as water reaches—he who meditates on water as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than water?’

‘Yes, there is something better than water.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## ELEVENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Fire (te<i>g</i>as) is better than water. For fire united with air, warms the ether. Then people say, It is hot, it burns, it will rain. Thus does fire, after showing this sign (itself) first, create water. And <span id="p118">[<sup><small>p. 118</small></sup>]</span> thus again thunderclaps come with lightnings, flashing upwards and across the sky. Then people say, There is lightning and thunder, it will rain. Then also does fire, after showing this sign first, create water. Meditate on fire.

2\. ‘He who meditates on fire as Brahman, obtains, resplendent himself, resplendent worlds, full of light and free of darkness; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as fire reaches—he who meditates on fire as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than fire?’

‘Yes, there is something better than fire.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## TWELFTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Ether (or space) is better than fire. For in the ether exist both sun and moon, the lightning, stars, and fire (agni). Through the ether we call, through the ether we hear, through the ether we answer [^310]. In the ether or space we rejoice (when we are together), and rejoice not (when we are separated). In the ether everything is born, and towards the ether everything tends when it is born [^311]. Meditate on ether.

2\. ‘He who meditates on ether as Brahman, obtains the worlds of ether and of light, which are free from pressure and pain, wide and spacious [^312]; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as ether reaches—he who meditates on ether as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than ether?’

<span id="p119">[<sup><small>p. 119</small></sup>]</span>

Yes, there Is something better than ether.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## THIRTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Memory [^313] (smara) is better than ether. Therefore where many are assembled together, if they have no memory, they would hear no one, they would not perceive, they would not understand. Through memory we know our sons, through memory our cattle. Meditate on memory.

2\. ‘He who meditates on memory as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as far as memory reaches;—he who meditates on memory as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than memory?’

‘Yes, there is something better than memory.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


## FOURTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Hope (â<i>s</i>â) is better than memory. Fired by hope does memory read the sacred hymns, perform sacrifices, desire sons and cattle, desire this world and the other. Meditate on hope.

2\. ‘He who meditates on hope as Brahman, all his desires are fulfilled by hope, his prayers are not in vain; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as hope reaches—he who meditates on hope as Brahman.’

‘Sir, is there something better than hope?’

‘Yes, there is something better than hope.’

‘Sir, tell it me.’


<span id="p120">[<sup><small>p. 120</small></sup>]</span>

## FIFTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'Spirit [^314] (prâ<i>n</i>a) is better than hope. As the spokes of a wheel hold to the nave [^315], so does all this (beginning with names and ending in hope) hold to spirit. That spirit moves by the spirit, it gives spirit to the spirit. Father means spirit, mother is spirit, brother is spirit, sister is spirit, tutor is spirit, Brâhma<i>n</i>a is spirit.

2\. 'For if one says anything unbecoming to a father, mother, brother, sister, tutor or Brâhma<i>n</i>a, then people say, Shame on thee! thou hast offended thy father, mother, brother, sister, tutor, or a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.

3\. 'But, if after the spirit has departed from them, one shoves them together with a poker, and burns them to pieces, no one would say, Thou offendest thy father, mother, brother, sister, tutor or a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.

4\. ‘Spirit then is all this. He who sees this, perceives this, and understands this, becomes an ativâdin [^316]. If people say to such a man, Thou <span id="p121">[<sup><small>p. 121</small></sup>]</span> art an ativâdin, he may say, I am an ativâdin; he need not deny it.’


## SIXTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [1](sbe01152.htm#fn_317).

1\. ‘But in reality he is an ativâdin who declares the Highest Being to be the True (Satya, τὸ ὄντως ὄν).’

‘Sir, may I become an ativâdin by the True?’

‘But we must desire to know the True.’

‘Sir, I desire to know the True.’


## SEVENTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. ‘When one understands the True, then one declares the True. One who does not understand it, does not declare the True [2](sbe01152.htm#fn_318). Only he who understands it, declares the True. This understanding, however, we must desire to understand.’

‘Sir, I desire to understand it.’


## EIGHTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. ‘When one perceives, then one understands. One who does not perceive, does not understand. Only he who perceives, understands. This perception, however, we must desire to understand.’

‘Sir, I desire to understand it.’


<span id="p122">[<sup><small>p. 122</small></sup>]</span>

## NINETEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. ‘When one believes, then one perceives. One who does not believe, does not perceive. Only he who believes, perceives. This belief, however, we must desire to understand.’

‘Sir, I desire to understand it.’


## TWENTIETH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. ‘When one attends on a tutor (spiritual guide), then one believes. One who does not attend on a tutor, does not believe. Only he who attends, believes. This attention on a tutor, however, we must desire to understand.’

‘Sir, I desire to understand it.’

## TWENTY-FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. ‘When one performs all sacred duties [^319], then one attends really on a tutor. One who does not perform his duties, does not really attend on a tutor. Only he who performs his duties, attends on his tutor. This performance of duties, however, we must desire to understand.’

‘Sir, I desire to understand it.’


## TWENTY-SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. ‘When one obtains bliss (in oneself), then one performs duties. One who does not obtain bliss, does not perform duties. Only he who obtains bliss, performs duties. This bliss, however, we must desire to understand.’

‘Sir, I desire to understand it.’


<span id="p123">[<sup><small>p. 123</small></sup>]</span>

## TWENTY-THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. ‘The Infinite (bhûman) [1](sbe01159.htm#fn_320) is bliss. There is no bliss in anything finite. Infinity only is bliss. This Infinity, however, we must desire to understand.’

‘Sir, I desire to understand it.’

## TWENTY-FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. ‘Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is the Infinite. Where one sees something else, hears something else, understands something else, that is the finite. The Infinite is immortal, the finite is mortal.’

‘Sir, in what does the Infinite rest?’

‘In its own greatness—or not even in greatness [2](sbe01159.htm#fn_321).’

2\. ‘In the world they call cows and horses, elephants and gold, slaves, wives, fields and houses greatness. I do not mean this,’ thus he spoke; 'for in that case one being (the possessor) rests in something else, (but the Infinite cannot rest in something different from itself)

## TWENTY-FIFTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'The Infinite indeed is below, above, behind, before, right and left—it is indeed all this.

‘Now follows the explanation of the Infinite as <span id="p124">[<sup><small>p. 124</small></sup>]</span> the I: I am below, I am above, I am behind, before, right and left—I am all this.

2\. 'Next follows the explanation of the Infinite as the Self: Self is below, above, behind, before, right and left—Self is all this.

‘He who sees, perceives, and understands this, loves the Self, delights in the Self, revels in the Self, rejoices in the Self—he becomes a Svarâ<i>g</i>, (an autocrat or self-ruler); he is lord and master in all the worlds.

‘But those who think differently from this, live in perishable worlds, and have other beings for their rulers.


## TWENTY-SIXTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. 'To him who sees, perceives, and understands this [^322], the spirit (prâ<i>n</i>a) springs from the Self, hope springs from the Self, memory springs from the Self; so do ether, fire, water, appearance and disappearance [^323], food, power, understanding, reflection, consideration, will, Mind, speech, names, sacred hymns, and sacrifices—aye, all this springs from the Self.

2\. 'There is this verse, "He who sees this, does not see death, nor illness, nor pain; he who sees this, sees everything, and obtains everything everywhere.

‘“He is one (before creation), he becomes three <span id="p125">[<sup><small>p. 125</small></sup>]</span> (fire, water, earth), he becomes five, he becomes seven, he becomes nine; then again he is called the eleventh, and hundred and ten and one thousand and twenty [^324].”

‘When the intellectual aliment has been purified, the whole nature becomes purified. When the whole nature has been purified, the memory becomes firm. And when the memory (of the Highest Self) remains firm, then all the ties (which bind us to a belief in anything but the Self) are loosened.

‘The venerable Sanatkumâra showed to Nârada, after his faults had been rubbed out, the other side of darkness. They call Sanatkumâra Skanda, yea, Skanda they call him.’

## Footnotes

[^302]: 110:1 This passage, exhibiting the sacred literature as known at the time, should be compared with the B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, II, 4, 10. The explanation of the old titles rests on the authority of <i>S</i>aṅkara, and he is not always consistent. See Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, 1873, 11, p. 10.

[^303]: 110:2 Why a man who knows the Veda should not know the Self, while in other places it is said that the Veda teaches the Self, is well illustrated by the commentary. If a royal procession approaches, he says, then, though. we do not see the king, because he is hidden by flags, parasols, &c., yet we say, there is the king. And if we ask who is the king, then again, though we cannot see him and point him out, we can say, at least, that he is different from all that is seen. The Self is hidden in the Veda as a king is hidden in a royal procession.

[^304]: 111:1 The commentator explains vya<i>g</i>ñâpayishyat by avi<i>g</i>ñâtam abhavishyat. Possibly h<i>ri</i>daya<i>g</i>ño stands for h<i>ri</i>daya<i>g</i>ñam.

[^305]: 112:1 The commentator explains this by saying that, without the instrument of the mind, the Self cannot act or enjoy.

[^306]: 112:2 Saṅkalpa is elsewhere defined as a modification of manas. The commentator says that, like thinking, it is an activity of the inner organ. It is difficult to find any English term exactly corresponding to saṅkalpa. Rajendralal Mitra translates it by will, but it implies not only will, but at the same time conception, determination, and desire.

[^307]: 113:1 This paragraph is obscure. The text seems doubtful, for instance, in samak<i>li</i>patâm, samakalpetâm, and samakalpatâm. Then the question is the exact meaning of sa<i>m</i>k<i>li</i>ptyai, which must be taken as an instrumental case. What is intended is that, without rain, food is impossible &c. or inconceivable; but the text says, ‘By the will of rain food wills,’ &c. Will seems almost to be taken here in the sense in which modern philosophers use it, as a kind of creative will. By the will of rain food wills, would mean, that first rain wills and exists, and afterwards the vital airs will and exist, &c.

[^308]: 113:2 <i>K</i>itta, thought, implies here consideration and reflection.

[^309]: 114:1 Reflection is concentration of all our thoughts on one object, ekâgratâ. And as a man who reflects and meditates on the highest objects acquires thereby repose, becomes firm and immovable, so the earth is supposed to be in repose and immovable, as it were, by reflection and meditation.

[^310]: 115:1 See before, p. 109.

[^311]: 116:1 The commentator takes vi<i>g</i>ñâna here as understanding of sacred books, <i>g</i>ñâna as cleverness with regard to other subjects.

[^312]: 118:1 Cf. <i>Kh</i>. Up. IV, 5, 2

[^313]: 118:2 The seed grows upwards towards the ether; not downwards.

[^314]: 118:3 Cf. Kâ<i>th</i>. Up. II, 11.

[^315]: 119:1 The apparent distance between ether and memory is bridged over by the commentator pointing out that without memory everything would be as if it were not, so far as we are concerned.

[^316]: 120:1 Prâ<i>n</i>a is used here in a technical sense. It does not mean simply breath, but the spirit, the conscious self (pra<i>g</i>ñâtman) which, as we saw, enters the body in order to reveal the whole variety of forms and names. It is in one sense the mukhya prâ<i>n</i>a.

[^317]: 120:2 The commentary carries the simile Still further. The felloe he says, holds to the spokes, the spokes to the nave. So do the bhûtamâtrâs hold to the pra<i>g</i>ñâmâtrâs, and these to the prâ<i>n</i>a.

[^318]: 120:3 One who declares something that goes beyond all the declarations made before, beginning with the declaration that names are Brahman, and ending with the declaration that hope is Brahman;—one who knows that prâ<i>n</i>a, spirit, the conscious self, is Brahman. This declaration represents the highest point reached by ordinary people, but Nârada wishes to go beyond. In the Mu<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, III, 1, 4, an ativâdin is contrasted with one who really knows the highest truth.

[^319]: 121:1 As Nârada asks no further, whether there is anything better, higher, truer than prâ<i>n</i>a, he is supposed to be satisfied with his belief that prâ<i>n</i>a is the Highest Being. Sanatkumâra, however, wishes to lead him on to a still higher view; hence the paragraphs which follow from 16 to 26.

[^320]: 121:2 He would, for instance, call fire real, not knowing that fire is only a mixture of the three elements (cf. VI, 4), the rûpatraya, a mere variety (vikâra), and name (nâman).

[^321]: 122:1 The duties of a student, such as restraint of the senses, concentration of the mind, &c.

[^322]: 123:1 Bhûman is sometimes translated by grandeur, the superlative, the akme. It is the highest point that can be reached, the infinite and the true.

[^323]: 123:2 This phrase reminds one of the last verse in the No sad âsîd hymn, where, likewise, the expression of the highest certainty is followed by a misgiving that after all it may be otherwise. The commentator takes yadi vâ in the sense of, if you ask in the highest sense, then I say no; for the Infinite cannot rest in anything, not even in greatness.

[^324]: 124:1 Before the acquirement of true knowledge, all that has been mentioned before, spirit, hope, memory, &c., on to names, was supposed to spring from the Sat, as something different from oneself. Now he is to know that the Sat is the Self.

[^325]: 124:2 In the preceding paragraphs appearance and disappearance (birth and death) are not mentioned. This shows how easy it was in these treatises either to omit or to add anything that seemed important.

[^326]: 125:1 This too is meant as a verse. The commentary says that the various numbers are intended to show the endless variety of form on the Self after creation. Cf. Mait. Up. V, 2.
