SEVENTH ADHYÂYA [^614].

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. My speech rests in the mind, my mind rests in speech [^615]. Appear to me (thou, the Highest Self)! You (speech and mind) are the two pins [^616] (that hold the wheels) of the Veda. May what I have learnt not forsake me [^617]. I join day and night with what I have learnt [^618]. I shall speak of the real, I shall speak the true. May this protect me, may this protect the teacher! May it protect me, may it protect the teacher, yea, the teacher!

## Footnotes

[^616]: 246:2 This seventh adhyâya contains a propitiatory prayer (<i>s</i>ântikaro mantra<i>h</i>). It is frequently left out in the MSS. which contain the Aitareya-upanishad with <i>S</i>aṅkara's commentary, and Dr. Roer has omitted it in his edition. Sâya<i>n</i>a explains it in his commentary on the Aitareya-âranyaka; and in one MS. of <i>S</i>aṅkara's commentary on the Aitareya-upanishad, which is in my possession, the seventh adhyâya is added with the commentary of Mâdhavâmâtya, the Â<i>g</i>ñâpâlaka of Vîrabukka-mahârâ<i>g</i>a.

[^617]: 246:3 The two depend on each other.

[^618]: 246:4 Ant, explained by the commentator as ânayanasamartha.

[^619]: 246:5 Cf. <i>Kh</i>. Up. IV, 2, 5.

[^620]: 246:6 I repeat it day and night so that I may not forget it.
