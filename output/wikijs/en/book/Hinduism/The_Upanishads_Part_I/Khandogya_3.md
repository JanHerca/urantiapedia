THIRD PRAPÂ<i>TH</i>AKA.

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^158].

1\. The sun is indeed the honey [^159] of the Devas. The heaven is the cross-beam (from which) the sky (hangs as) a hive, and the bright vapours are the eggs of the bees [^160].

2\. The eastern rays of the sun are the honey-cells in front. The <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses are the bees, the Rig-veda (sacrifice) is the flower, the water (of the sacrificial libations) is the nectar (of the flower).

3\. Those very <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses then (as bees) brooded over the Rig-veda sacrifice (the flower); and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health [^161].

4\. That (essence) flowed forth and went towards the sun [^162]. And that forms what we call the red (rohita) light of the rising sun.

<span id="p39">[<sup><small>p. 39</small></sup>]</span>

## SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. The southern rays of the sun are the honey-cells on the right. The Ya<i>g</i>us verses are the bees, the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda sacrifice is the flower, the water (of the sacrificial libations) is the nectar (of the flower).

2\. Those very Ya<i>g</i>us verses (as bees) brooded over the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda sacrifice (the flower); and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health.

3\. That flowed forth and went towards the sun. And that forms what we call the white (<i>s</i>ukla) light of the sun.

## THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. The western rays of the sun are the honey-cells behind. The Sâman verses are the bees, the Sâma-veda sacrifice is the flower, the water is the nectar.

2\. Those very Sâman verses (as bees) brooded over the Sâma-veda sacrifice; and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health.

3\. That flowed forth and went towards the sun. And that forms what we call the dark (k<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a) light of the sun.

## FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. The northern rays of the sun are the honey-cells on the left. The (hymns of the) Atharvâṅgiras are the bees, the Itihâsa-purâ<i>n</i>a [^163] (the reading of the old stories) is the flower, the water is the nectar. <span id="p40">[<sup><small>p. 40</small></sup>]</span> 2\. Those very hymns of the Atharvâṅgiras (as bees) brooded over the Itihâsa-purâ<i>n</i>a; and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health.

3\. That flowed forth, and went towards the sun. And that forms what we call the extreme dark (para<i>h</i> k<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>am) light of the sun.

## FIFTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. The upward rays of the sun are the honey cells above. The secret doctrines are the bees, Brahman (the Om) is the flower, the water is the nectar.

2\. Those secret doctrines (as bees) brooded over Brahman (the Om); and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of countenance, brightness, vigour, strength, and health.

3\. That flowed forth, and went towards the sun. And that forms what seems to stir in the centre of the sun.

4\. These (the different colours in the sun) are the essences of the essences. For the Vedas are essences (the best things in the world); and of them (after they have assumed the form of sacrifice) these (the colours rising to the sun) are again the essences. They are the nectar of the nectar. For the Vedas are nectar (immortal), and of them these are the nectar.




<span id="p41">[<sup><small>p. 41</small></sup>]</span>

## SIXTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. On the first of these nectars (the red light, which represents fame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, health) the Vasus live, with Agni at their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.

2\. They enter into that (red) colour, and they rise from that colour [^164].

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Vasus, with Agni at their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, too, having entered that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west [^165], so long does he follow the sovereign supremacy of the Vasus.

## SEVENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. On the second of these nectars the Rudras live, with Indra at their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.

2\. They enter into that white colour, and they rise from that colour.

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Rudras, with Indra at their head, he sees the <span id="p42">[<sup><small>p. 42</small></sup>]</span> nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, twice as long does it rise in the south and set in the north; and so long does he follow the sovereign supremacy of the Rudras.

## EIGHTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. On the third of these nectars the Âdityas live, with Varu<i>n</i>a at their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.

2\. They enter into that (dark) colour, and they rise from that colour.

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Âdityas, with Varu<i>n</i>a at their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the south and sets in the north, twice as long does it rise in the west and set in the east; and so long does he follow the sovereign supremacy of the Âdityas.

## NINTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. On the fourth of these nectars the Maruts live, with Soma at their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.

2\. They enter in that (very dark) colour, and they rise from that colour.

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Maruts, with Soma at their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the west and sets <span id="p43">[<sup><small>p. 43</small></sup>]</span> in the east, twice as long does it rise in the north and set in the south; and so long does he follow the sovereign supremacy of the Maruts.

## TENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. On the fifth of these nectars the Sâdhyas live, with Brahman at their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.

2\. They enter into that colour, and they rise from that colour.

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Sâdhyas, with Brahman at their head; he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the north and sets in the south, twice as long does it rise above, and set below; and so long does he follow the sovereign power of the Sâdhyas [^166].

<span id="p44">[<sup><small>p. 44</small></sup>]</span>

## ELEVENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. When from thence he has risen upwards, he neither rises nor sets. He is alone, standing in the centre. And on this there is this verse:

2\. ‘Yonder he neither rises nor sets at any time. If this is not true, ye gods, may I lose Brahman.’

3\. And indeed to him who thus knows this Brahma-upanishad (the secret doctrine: of the Veda) the sun does not rise and does not set. For him there is day, once and for all [^167].

4\. This doctrine (beginning with III, 1, 1) Brahman (m. Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha) told to Pra<i>g</i>âpati (Virâ<i>g</i>), Pra<i>g</i>âpati to Manu, Manu to his offspring (Ikshvâku, &c.) And the father told that (doctrine of) Brahman (n.) to Uddâlaka Âru<i>n</i>i.

5\. A father may therefore tell that doctrine of Brahman to his eldest son [^168], or to a worthy pupil.

But no one should tell it to anybody else, even if he gave him the whole sea-girt earth, full of treasure, for this doctrine is worth more than that, yea, it is worth more.

## TWELFTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. The Gâyatrî [^169] (verse) is everything whatsoever here exists. Gâyatrî indeed is speech, for speech <span id="p45">[<sup><small>p. 45</small></sup>]</span> sings forth (gâya-ti) and protects (trâya-te) everything that here exists.

2\. That Gâyatrî is also the earth, for everything that here exists rests on the earth, and does not go beyond.

3\. That earth again is the body in man, for in it the vital airs (prâ<i>n</i>as [^170], which are everything) rest, and do not go beyond.

4\. That body again in man is the heart within man, for in it the prâ<i>n</i>as (which are everything) rest, and do not go beyond.

5\. That Gâyatrî has four feet [^171] and is sixfold [^172]. And this is also declared by a <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verse (Rig-Veda X, 90, 3):—

6\. ‘Such is the greatness of it (of Brahman, under the disguise of Gâyatrî [^173]); greater than it is the Person [^174] (purusha). His feet are all things. The immortal with three feet is in heaven (i. e. in himself).’ <span id="p46">[<sup><small>p. 46</small></sup>]</span> 7\. The Brahman which has been thus described (as immortal with three feet in heaven, and as Gâyatrî) is the same as the ether which is around us;

8\. And the ether which is around us, is the same as the ether which is within us. And the ether which is within us,

9\. That is the ether within the heart. That ether in the heart (as Brahman) is omnipresent and unchanging. He who knows this obtains omnipresent and unchangeable happiness.

## THIRTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^175].

1\. For that heart there are five gates belonging to the Devas (the senses). The eastern gate is the Prâ<i>n</i>a (up-breathing), that is the eye, that is Âditya (the sun). Let a man meditate on that as brightness (glory of countenance) and health. He who knows this, becomes bright and healthy.

2\. The southern gate is the Vyâna (back-breathing), that is the ear, that is the moon. Let a man meditate on that as happiness and fame. He who knows this, becomes happy and famous.

3\. The western gate is the Apâna (down-breathing), that is speech, that is Agni (fire). Let a man meditate on that as glory of countenance and health. He who knows this, becomes glorious and healthy.

4\. The northern gate is the Samâna (on-breathing), that is mind, that is Par<i>g</i>anya (rain). Let a man meditate on that as celebrity and beauty. <span id="p47">[<sup><small>p. 47</small></sup>]</span> He who knows this, becomes celebrated and beautiful.

5\. The upper gate is the Udâna (out-breathing), that is air, that is ether. Let a man meditate on that as strength and greatness. He who knows this, becomes strong and great.

6\. These are the five men of Brahman, the doorkeepers of the Svarga (heaven) world. He who knows these five men of Brahman, the door-keepers of the Svarga world, in his family a strong son is born. He who thus knows these five men of Brahman, as the door-keepers of the Svarga world, enters himself the Svarga world.

7\. Now that light which shines above this heaven, higher than all, higher than everything, in the highest world, beyond which there are no other worlds, that is the same light which is within man. And of this we have this visible proof [^176]:

8\. Namely, when we thus perceive by touch the warmth here in the body [^177]. And of it we have this audible proof: Namely, when we thus, after stopping our ears, listen to what is like the rolling of a carriage, or the bellowing of an ox, or the sound of a burning fire [^178] (within the ears). Let a man meditate on this as the (Brahman) which is seen and heard. <span id="p48">[<sup><small>p. 48</small></sup>]</span> He, who knows this, becomes conspicuous and celebrated, yea, he becomes celebrated.

## FOURTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. All this is Brahman (n.) Let a man meditate on that (visible world) as beginning, ending, and breathing [^179] in it (the Brahman).

Now man is a creature of will. According to what his will is in this world, so will he be when he has departed this life. Let him therefore have this will and belief:

2\. The intelligent, whose body is spirit, whose form is light, whose thoughts are true, whose nature is like ether (omnipresent and invisible), from whom all works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes proceed; he who embraces all this, who never speaks, and is never surprised,

3\. He is my self within the heart, smaller than a corn of rice, smaller than a corn of barley, smaller than a mustard seed, smaller than a canary seed or the kernel of a canary seed. He also is my self within the heart, greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds.

4\. He from whom all works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes proceed, who embraces all this, who never speaks and who is never surprised, he, my self within the heart, is that Brahman (n.) When I shall have departed from hence, I shall obtain him (that Self). He who has this faith [^180] has no doubt; thus said <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya [^181], yea, thus he said.

<span id="p49">[<sup><small>p. 49</small></sup>]</span>

## FIFTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^182].

1\. The chest which has the sky for its circumference and the earth for its bottom, does not decay, for the quarters are its sides, and heaven its lid above. That chest is a treasury, and all things are within it.

2\. Its eastern quarter is called <i>G</i>uhû, its southern Sahamânâ, its western Râ<i>g</i>ñî, its northern Subhûtâ [^183]. The child of those quarters is Vâyu, the air, and he who knows that the air is indeed the child of the quarters, never weeps for his sons. ‘I know the wind to be the child of the quarters, may I never weep for my sons.’

3\. ‘I turn to the imperishable chest with such and such and such [^184].’ ‘I turn to the Prâ<i>n</i>a (life) with such and such and such.’ ‘I turn to Bhû<i>h</i> with such and such and such.’ ‘I turn to Bhuva<i>h</i> with such and such and such.’ ‘I turn to Sva<i>h</i> with such and such and such.’

4\. ‘When I said, I turn to Prâ<i>n</i>a, then Prâ<i>n</i>a means all whatever exists here—to that I turn.’

5\. ‘When I said, I turn to Bhû<i>h</i>, what I said is, I turn to the earth, the sky, and heaven.’ <span id="p50">[<sup><small>p. 50</small></sup>]</span> 6\. ‘When I said, I turn to Bhuva<i>h</i>, what I said is, I turn to Agni (fire), Vâyu (air), Âditya (sun).’

7\. ‘When I said, I turn to Sva<i>h</i>, what I said is, I turn to the <i>Ri</i><i>g</i>\-veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, and Sâma-veda. That is what I said, yea, that is what I said.’

## SIXTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^185].

1\. Man is sacrifice. His (first) twenty-four years are the morning-libation. The Gâyatrî has twenty-four syllables, the morning-libation is offered with Gâyatrî hymns. The Vasus are connected with that part of the sacrifice. The Prâ<i>n</i>as (the five senses) are the Vasus, for they make all this to abide (vâsayanti).

2\. If anything ails him in that (early) age, let him say: ‘Ye Prâ<i>n</i>as, ye Vasus, extend this my morning-libation unto the midday-libation, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Prâ<i>n</i>as or Vasus.’ Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.

3\. The next forty-four years are the midday-libation. The Trish<i>t</i>ubh has forty-four syllables, the midday-libation is offered with Trish<i>t</i>ubh hymns. The Rudras are connected with that part of it. The Prâ<i>n</i>as are the Rudras, for they make all this to cry (rodayanti).

4\. If anything ails him in that (second) age, let him say: ‘Ye Prâ<i>n</i>as, ye Rudras, extend this my midday-libation unto the third libation, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Prâ<i>n</i>as or Rudras.’ Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.

5\. The next forty-eight years are the third <span id="p51">[<sup><small>p. 51</small></sup>]</span> libation. The <i>G</i>agatî has forty-eight syllables, the third libation is offered with <i>G</i>agatî hymns. The Âdityas are connected with that part of it. The Prâ<i>n</i>as are the Âdityas, for they take up all this (âdadate).

6\. If anything ails him in that (third) age, let him say: ‘Ye Prâ<i>n</i>as, ye Âdityas, extend this my third libation unto the full age, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Prâ<i>n</i>as or Âdityas.’ Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.

7\. Mahidâsa Aitareya (the son of Itarâ), who knew this, said (addressing a disease): ‘Why dost thou afflict me, as I shall not die by it?’ He lived a hundred and sixteen years (i.e. 24+44+48). He, too, who knows this lives on to a hundred and sixteen years.

## SEVENTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^186].

1\. When a man (who is the sacrificer) hungers, thirsts, and abstains from pleasures, that is the Dîkshâ (initiatory rite).

2\. When a man eats, drinks, and enjoys pleasures, he does it with the Upasadas (the sacrificial days on which the sacrificer is allowed to partake of food).

3\. When a man laughs, eats, and delights himself, he does it with the Stuta-<i>s</i>astras (hymns sung and recited at the sacrifices).

4\. Penance, liberality, righteousness, kindness, truthfulness, these form his Dakshi<i>n</i>âs (gifts bestowed on priests, &c.)

5\. Therefore when they say, ‘There will be a <span id="p52">[<sup><small>p. 52</small></sup>]</span> birth,’ and ‘there has been a birth’ (words used at the Soma-sacrifice, and really meaning, ‘He will pour out the Soma-juice,’ and ‘he has poured out the Soma-juice’), that is his new birth. His death is the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha ceremony (when the sacrificial Vessels are carried away to be cleansed).

6\. Ghora Âṅgirasa, after having communicated this (view of the sacrifice) to K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, the son of Devăkî [^187]\—and he never thirsted again (after other knowledge)—said: ‘Let a man, when his end approaches, <span id="p53">[<sup><small>p. 53</small></sup>]</span> take refuge with this Triad [^188]: “Thou art the imperishable,” “Thou art the unchangeable,” “Thou art the edge of Prâ<i>n</i>a.”’ On this subject there are two <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses (Rig-veda VIII, 6, 30):—

7\. ‘Then they see (within themselves) the ever-present light of the old seed (of the world, the Sat), the highest, which is lighted in the brilliant (Brahman).’ Rig-veda I, 50, 10:—

‘Perceiving above the darkness (of ignorance) the higher light (in the sun), as the higher light within the heart, the bright source (of light and life) among the gods, we have reached the highest light, yea, the highest light [^189].’

## EIGHTEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^190].

1\. Let a man meditate on mind as Brahman (n.), this is said with reference to the body. Let a man meditate on the ether as Brahman (n.), this is said with reference to the Devas. Thus both the meditation which has reference to the body, and the meditation which has reference to the Devas, has been taught.

2\. That Brahman (mind) has four feet (quarters). <span id="p54">[<sup><small>p. 54</small></sup>]</span> Speech is one foot, breath is one foot, the eye is one foot, the car is one foot-so much with reference to the body. Then with reference to the gods, Agni (fire) is one foot, Vâyu (air) is one foot, Âditya (sun) is one foot, the quarters are one foot. Thus both the worship which has reference to the body, and the worship which has reference to the Devas, has been taught.

3\. Speech is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with Agni (fire) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.

4\. Breath is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with Vâyu (air) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.

5\. The eye is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with Âditya (sun) as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.

6\. The ear is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That foot shines with the quarters as its light, and warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.

## NINETEENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Âditya (the sun [^191]) is Brahman, this is the doctrine, and this is the fuller account of it:—

In the beginning this was non-existent [^192]. It became <span id="p55">[<sup><small>p. 55</small></sup>]</span> existent, it grew. It turned into an egg [^193]. The egg lay for the time of a year. The egg broke open. The two halves were one of silver, the other of gold.

2\. The silver one became this earth, the golden one the sky, the thick membrane (of the white) the mountains, the thin membrane (of the yoke) the mist with the clouds, the small veins the rivers, the fluid the sea.

3\. And what was born from it that was Âditya, the sun. When he was born shouts of hurrah arose, and all beings arose, and all things which they desired. Therefore whenever the sun rises and sets, shouts of hurrah arise, and all beings arise, and all things which they desire.

4\. If any one knowing this meditates on the sun as Brahman, pleasant shouts will approach him and will continue, yea, they will continue.

## Footnotes

[^159]: 38:1 After the various meditations on the Sâma-veda sacrifice, the sun is next to be meditated on, as essential to the performance of all sacrifices.

[^160]: 38:2 Everybody delights in the sun, as the highest reward of all sacrifices.

[^161]: 38:3 I am not certain whether this passage is rightly translated. Rajendralal Mitra speaks of an arched bamboo, whence the atmosphere hangs pendant like a hive, in which the vapours are the eggs. Apûpa means a cake, and may mean a hive. In order to understand the simile, we ought to have a clearer idea of the construction of the ancient bee-hive.

[^162]: 38:4 Annâdya, explained as food, but more likely meaning power to eat, appetite, health. See III, 13, 1.

[^163]: 38:5 The commentator explains: The <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses, on becoming part of the ceremonial, perform the sacrifice. The sacrifice (the flower), when surrounded by the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses (bees), yields its essence, the nectar. That essence consists in all the rewards to be obtained through sacrifice, and as these rewards are to be enjoyed in the p. 39 next world and in the sun, therefore that essence or nectar is said to ascend to the sun.

[^164]: 39:1 As there is no Atharva-veda sacrifice, properly so called, we have corresponding to the Atharva-veda hymns the so-called fifth p. 40 Veda, the Itihâsa-purâ<i>n</i>a. This may mean the collection of legends and traditions, or the old book of traditions. At all events it is taken as one Purâ<i>n</i>a, not as many. These ancient stories were repeated at the A<i>s</i>vamedha sacrifice during the so-called Pariplava nights. Many of them have been preserved in the Brâhma<i>n</i>as; others, in a more modern form, in the Mahâbhârata. See Weber, Indische Studien, I, p. 258, note.

[^165]: 41:1 This is differently explained by the commentator. He takes it to mean that, when the Vasus have gone to the sun, and see that there is no opportunity for enjoying that colour, they rest; but when they see that there is an opportunity for enjoying it, they exert themselves for it. I think the colour is here taken for the colour of the morning, which the Vasus enter, and from which they go forth again.

[^166]: 41:2 1. East: Vasus: red: Agni. 2. South: Rudras: white: Indra. 3. West: Âditya: dark: Varu<i>n</i>a. 4. North: Marut: very dark: Soma. 5. Upward: Sâdhya: centre: Brahman.

[^167]: 43:1 The meaning of the five Khandas from 6 to 10 is clear, in so far as they are intended to show that he who knows or meditates on the sacrifices as described before, enjoys his reward in different worlds with the Vasus, Rudras, &c. for certain periods of time, till at last he reaches the true Brahman. Of these periods each succeeding one is supposed to be double the length of the preceding one. This is expressed by imagining a migration of the sun from east to south, west, north, and zenith. Each change of the sun marks a new world, and the duration of each successive world is computed as double the duration of the preceding world. Similar ideas have been more fully developed in the Purâ<i>n</i>as, and the commentator is at great pains to remove apparent contradictions between the Paurâ<i>n</i>ik and Vaidik accounts, following, as Ânanda<i>g</i>ñânagiri remarks, the Dravi<i>d</i>â<i>k</i>ârya (p. 173, l. 13).

[^168]: 44:1 Cf. <i>Kh</i>. Up. VIII, 4, 2.

[^169]: 44:2 This was the old, not the present custom, says Ânandagiri. Not the father, but an â<i>k</i>ârya, has now to teach his pupils.

[^170]: 44:3 The Gâyatrî is one of the sacred metres, and is here to be meditated on as Brahman. It is used in the sense of verse, and as the name of a famous hymn. The Gâyatrî is often praised as the most powerful metre, and whatever can be obtained by means of the recitation of Gâyatrî verses is described as the achievement of the Gâyatrî. The etymology of gâyatrî from gai and trâ is, of course, fanciful.

[^171]: 45:1 The prâ<i>n</i>as may be meant for the five senses, as explained in <i>Kh</i>. I, 2, 1; II, 7, 1; or for the five breathings, as explained immediately afterwards in III, 13, 1. The commentator sees in them everything that here exists (<i>Kh</i>. Up. III, 15, 4), and thus establishes the likeness between the body and the Gâyatrî. As Gâyatrî is the earth, and the earth the body, and the body the heart, Gâyatrî is in the end to be considered as the heart.

[^172]: 45:2 The four feet are explained as the four quarters of the Gâyatrî metre, of six syllables each. The Gâyatrî really consists of three feet of eight syllables each.

[^173]: 45:3 The Gâyatrî has been identified with all beings, with speech, earth, body, heart, and the vital airs, and is therefore called sixfold. This, at least, is the way in which the commentator accounts for the epithet ‘sixfold.’

[^174]: 45:4 Of Brahman modified as Gâyatrî, having four feet, and being sixfold.

[^175]: 45:5 The real Brahman, unmodified by form and name.

[^176]: 46:1 The meditation on the five gates and the five gate-keepers of the heart is meant to be subservient to the meditation on Brahman, as the ether in the heart, which, as it is said at the end, is actually seen and heard by the senses as being within the heart.

[^177]: 47:1 The presence of Brahman in the heart of man is not to rest on the testimony of revelation only, but is here to be established by the evidence of the senses. Childish as the argument may seem to us, it shows at all events how intently the old Brahmans thought on the problem of the evidence of the invisible.

[^178]: 47:2 That warmth must come from something, just as smoke comes from fire, and this something is supposed to be Brahman in the heart.

[^179]: 47:3 Cf. Ait. Âr. III, 2, 4, 11-13.

[^180]: 48:1 <i>G</i>alân is explained by <i>g</i>a, born, la, absorbed, and an, breathing. It is an artificial term, but fully recognised by the Vedânta school, and always explained in this manner.

[^181]: 48:2 Or he who has faith and no doubt, will obtain this.

[^182]: 48:3 This chapter is frequently quoted as the <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya-vidyâ, Vedântasâra, init; Vedânta-sûtra III, 3, 31.

[^183]: 49:1 The object of this section, the Ko<i>s</i>avi<i>g</i>ñâna, is to show how the promise made in III, 13, 6, 'that a strong son should be born in a man's family,' is to be fulfilled.

[^184]: 49:2 These names are explained by the commentator as follows: Because people offer libations (<i>g</i>uhvati), turning to the east, therefore it is called <i>G</i>uhû. Because evil doers suffer (sahante) in the town of Yama, which is in the south, therefore it is called Sahamânâ. The western quarter is called Râ<i>g</i>ñî, either because it is sacred to king Varu<i>n</i>a (râ<i>g</i>an), or on account of the red colour (râ<i>g</i>a) of the twilight. The north is called Subhûtâ, because wealthy beings (bhûtimat), like Kuvera &c., reside there.

[^185]: 49:3 Here the names of the sons are to be pronounced.

[^186]: 50:1 The object of this Kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a is to show how to obtain long life, as promised before.

[^187]: 51:1 Here we have a representation of the sacrifice as performed without any ceremonial, and as it is often represented when performed in thought only by a man living in the forest.

[^188]: 52:1 The curious coincidence between K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a Devakîputra, here mentioned as a pupil of Ghora Âṅgirasa, and the famous K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, the son of Devakî, was first pointed out by Colebrooke, Miscell. Essays, II, 177. Whether it is more than a coincidence, is difficult to say. Certainly we can build no other conclusions on it than those indicated by Colebrooke, that new fables may have been constructed elevating this personage to the rank of a god. We know absolutely nothing of the old K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a Devakîputra except his having been a pupil of Ghora Âṅgirasa, nor does there seem to have been any attempt made by later Brahmans to connect their divine K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, the son of Vasudeva, with the K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a Devakîputra of our Upanishad. This is all the more remarkable because the author of the Sâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya-sûtras, for instance, who is very anxious to find a <i>s</i>rauta authority for the worship of K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a Vâsudeva as the supreme deity, had to be satisfied with quoting such modern compilations as the Nârâya<i>n</i>opanishad, Atharva<i>s</i>iras, VI, 9, brahma<i>n</i>yo devakîputro, brahmanyo madhusûdana<i>h</i> (see Sâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilya-sûtras, ed. Ballantyne, p. 36, translated by Cowell, p. 51), without venturing to refer to the K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a Devakîputra of the Khândogya-upanishad. The occurrence of such names as K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, Vâsudeva, Madhusûdanah stamps Upanishads, like the Âtmabodha-upanishad, as modern (Colebrooke, Essays, 1, 101), and the same remark applies, as Weber has shown, to the Gopâlatâpanî-upanishad (Bibliotheca Indica, No. 183), where we actually find such names as <i>S</i>rîk<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a Govinda, Gopî<i>g</i>anavallabha, Devakyâm gâtâ<i>h</i> (p. 38), &c. Professor Weber has treated these questions very fully, but it is not quite clear to me whether he wishes to go beyond Colebrooke and to admit more than a similarity of name between the pupil of Ghora Âṅgirasa and the friend of the Gopîs.

[^189]: 53:1 Let him recite these three verses.

[^190]: 53:2 Both these verses had to be translated here according to their scholastic interpretation, but they had originally a totally different meaning. Even the text was altered, divâ being changed to divi, sva<i>h</i> to sve. The first is taken from a hymn addressed to Indra, who after conquering the dark clouds brings back the light of the sun. When he does that, then the people see again, as the poet says, the daily light of the old seed (from which the sun rises) which is lighted in heaven. The other verse belongs to a hymn addressed to the sun. Its simple meaning. is: ‘Seeing above the darkness (of the night) the rising light, the Sun, bright among the bright, we came towards the highest light.’

[^191]: 53:3 This is a further elucidation of <i>Kh</i>. Up. III, 14, 2.

[^192]: 54:1 Âditya, or the sun, had before been represented as one of the four feet of Brahman. He is now represented as Brahman, or as to be meditated on as such.

[^193]: 54:2 Not yet existing, not yet developed in form and name, and therefore as if not existing.

[^194]: 55:1 Â<i>n</i><i>d</i>a instead of a<i>n</i><i>d</i>a is explained as a Vedic irregularity. A similar cosmogony is given in Manu's Law Book, I, 12 seq. See Kellgren, Mythus de ovo mundano, Helsingfors, 1849.
