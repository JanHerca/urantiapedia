SECOND ADHYÂYA [^525].

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. He (the sun), who shines, honoured this world (the body of the worshipper, by entering into it), in the form of man [^526] (the worshipper who meditates on breath). For he who shines (the sun) is (the same as) the breath. He honoured this (body of the worshipper) during a hundred years, therefore there are a hundred years in the life of a man. Because he honoured him during a hundred years, therefore there are (the poets of the first Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Satar<i>k</i>in, (having honour for a <span id="p215">[<sup><small>p. 215</small></sup>]</span> hundred years.) Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), the Satar<i>k</i>in poets [^527].

2\. He (breath) placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists. Because he placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists, therefore there are (the poets of the second to the ninth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Mâdhyamas. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), the Mâdhyama poets.

3\. He as up-breathing is the swallower (g<i>ri</i>tsa), as down-breathing he is delight (mada). Because as up-breathing he is swallower (g<i>ri</i>tsa) and as down-breathing delight (mada), therefore there is (the poet of the second Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) G<i>ri</i>tsamada. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Gritsamada.

4\. Of him. (breath) all this whatsoever was a friend. Because of him all (vi<i>s</i>vam) this whatsoever was a friend (mitram), therefore there is (the poet of the third Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra.

5\. The Devas (speech, &c.) said to him (the breath): ‘He is to be loved by all of us.’ Because the Devas said of him, that he was to be loved (vâma) by all of them, therefore there is (the poet of the fourth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vâmadeva. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Vâmadeva.

6\. He (breath) guarded all this whatsoever from evil. Because he guarded (atrâyata) all this whatsoever <span id="p216">[<sup><small>p. 216</small></sup>]</span> from evil, therefore there are (the poets of the fifth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) Atraya<i>h</i>. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Atraya<i>h</i>.

## SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. He (breath) is likewise a Bibhradvâga (bringer of offspring). Offspring is vâ<i>g</i>a, and he (breath) supports offspring. Because he supports it, therefore there is (the poet of the sixth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) Bharadvâga. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Bharadvâga.

2\. The Devas (speech, &c.) said to him: ‘He it is who chiefly causes us to dwell on earth.’ Because the Devas said of him, that he chiefly caused them to dwell on earth, therefore there is (the poet of the seventh Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vasish<i>th</i>a. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Vasish<i>th</i>a [^528].

3\. He (breath) went forth towards [^529] all this whatsoever. Because he went forth toward all this whatsoever, therefore there are (the poets of the eighth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Pragâthas. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), the Pragâthas.

4\. He (breath) purified all this whatsoever. Because he purified all this whatsoever, therefore there <span id="p217">[<sup><small>p. 217</small></sup>]</span> are (the hymns and also the poets [^530] of the ninth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Pavamânîs. Therefore people called him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), the Pavamânîs.

5\. He (breath) said: ‘Let me be everything whatsoever, small (kshudra) and great (mahat), and this became the Kshudrasûktas and Mahâsûktas.’ Therefore there were (the hymns and also the poets of the tenth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Kshudrasûktas (and Mahâsûktas). Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), the Kshudrasûktas (and Mahâsûktas).

6\. He (breath) said once: ‘You have said what is well said (su-ukta) indeed. This became a Sûkta (hymn).’ Therefore there was the Sûkta. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Sûkta [^531].

7\. He (breath) is a <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (verse), for he did honour [^532] to all beings (by entering into them). Because he did honour to all beings, therefore there was the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verse. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>.

8\. He (breath) is an Ardhar<i>k</i>a (half-verse), for he did honour to all places (ardha) [^533]. Because he did honour to all places, therefore there was the Ardhar<i>k</i>a. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Ardhar<i>k</i>a. <span id="p218">[<sup><small>p. 218</small></sup>]</span> 9\. He (breath) is a Pada (word) [^534], for he got into all these beings. Because he got (pâdi) into all these beings, therefore there was the Pada (word). Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Pada.

10\. He (breath) is an Akshara (syllable), for he pours out (ksharati) gifts to all these beings, and without him no one can pour out (atiksharati) gifts. Therefore there was the Akshara (syllable). Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Akshara [^535].

11\. Thus all these <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses, all Vedas, all sounds [^536] are one word, viz. Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath). Let him know that Prâ<i>n</i>a is all <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses.

## THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. While Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra was going to repeat the hymns of this day (the mahâvrata), Indra sat down near him [^537]. Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted food) said to him, ‘This (the verses of the hymn) is food,’ and repeated the thousand B<i>ri</i>hatî verses [^538] <span id="p219">[<sup><small>p. 219</small></sup>]</span> By means of this he went to the delightful home of Indra (Svarga).

2\. Indra said to him: ‘<i>Ri</i>shi, thou hast come to my delightful home. <i>Ri</i>shi, repeat a second hymn [^539].’ Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted food) said to him, ‘This (the verses of the hymn) is food,’ and repeated the thousand B<i>ri</i>hatî verses. By means of this he went to the delightful home of Indra (Svarga).

3\. Indra said to him: ‘<i>Ri</i>shi, thou hast come to my delightful home. <i>Ri</i>shi, repeat a third hymn.’ Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted food) said to him, ‘This (the verses of the hymn) is food,’ and repeated the thousand B<i>ri</i>hatî verses. By means of this he went to the delightful home of Indra (Svarga).

4\. Indra said to him: ‘<i>Ri</i>shi, thou hast come to my delightful home. I grant thee a boon.’ Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra said: ‘May I know thee.’ Indra said: ‘I am Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), O <i>Ri</i>shi, thou art Prâ<i>n</i>a, all things are Prâ<i>n</i>a. For it is Prâ<i>n</i>a who shines as the sun, and I here pervade all regions under that form. This food of mine (the hymn) is my friend and my support (dakshi<i>n</i>a). This is the food prepared by Visvâmitra. I am verily he who shines (the sun).’


<span id="p220">[<sup><small>p. 220</small></sup>]</span>

## FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. This then becomes perfect as a thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatî verses. Its consonants [^540] form its body, its voice [^541] (vowels) the Soul [^542], its sibilants [^543] the air of the breath.

2\. He who knew this became Vasish<i>th</i>a, he took this name from thence [^544].

3\. Indra verily declared this to Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra, and Indra verily declared this to Bharadvâga. Therefore Indra is invoked by him as a friend [^545].

4\. This becomes perfect as a thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatî verses [^546], and of that hymn perfect with a thousand Brihad verses, there are 36,000 syllables [^547]. So many are also the thousands of days of a hundred years (36,000). With the consonants they fill the nights, with the vowels the days.

5\. This becomes perfect as a thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatî verses. He who knows this, after this thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatîs thus accomplished, becomes full of knowledge, full of the gods, full of Brahman, full of the immortal, and then goes also to the gods.

6\. What I am (the worshipper), that is he (sun); what he is, that am I. <span id="p221">[<sup><small>p. 221</small></sup>]</span> 7\. This has been said by a <i>Ri</i>shi (Rv. I, 115, 1): ‘The sun is the self of all that moves and rests.’

8\. Let him look to that, let him look to that!

## Footnotes

[^527]: 214:1 In the first adhyâya various forms of meditating on Uktha, conceived as Prâ<i>n</i>a (life), have been declared. In the second some other forms of meditation, all extremely fanciful, are added. They are of interest, however, as showing the existence of the hymns of the Rig-veda, divided and arranged as we now possess them, at the time when this Âra<i>n</i>yaka was composed.

[^528]: 214:2 The identity of the sun and of breath as living in man has been established before. It is the same power in both, conceived either adhidaivatam (mythological) or adhyâtmam (physiological).

[^529]: 215:1 The real ground for the name is that the poets of the first Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala composed on an average each about a hundred <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, verses.

[^530]: 216:1 I translate in accordance with the commentator, and probably with the intention of the author. The same etymology is repeated in the commentary on II, 2, 4, 2. It would be more natural to take vasish<i>th</i>a in the sense of the richest.

[^531]: 216:2 This is the interpretation of the commentator, and the preposition abhi seems to show that the author too took that view of the etymology of pragâtha.

[^532]: 217:1 It seems, indeed, as if in the technical language of the Brahmans, the poets of the ninth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala were sometimes called Pavamânîs, and the hymns of the tenth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala Kshudrasûktas and Mahâsûktas (masc.) Cf. Ârsheya-brâhma<i>n</i>a, ed. Burnell, p. 42.

[^533]: 217:2 The poet also is called Sûkta, taddrash<i>t</i>âpi sûktanâmako 'bhût. Comm.

[^534]: 217:3 I translate according to the commentator.

[^535]: 217:4 Ardha means both half and place.

[^536]: 218:1 It may also be intended for pâda, foot of a verse.

[^537]: 218:2 The Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath) is to be meditated on as all hymns, all poets, all words, &c. Comm.

[^538]: 218:3 All aspirated sonant consonants. Comm.

[^539]: 218:4 Upanishasasâda, instead of upanishasâda. The mistake is probably due to a correction, sa for sha; the commentator, however, considers it as a Vedic license. Skâro 'dhika<i>s</i> <i>kh</i>ândasa<i>h</i>.

[^540]: 218:5 These are meant for the Nishkevalya hymn recited at the noon-libation of the Mahâvrata. That hymn consists of ten parts, corresponding, as we saw, to ten parts of a bird, viz. its body, neck, head, root of wings, right wing, left wing, tail, belly, chest, and thighs. The verses corresponding to these ten parts, beginning with tad id asa bhuvaneshu <i>g</i>yesh<i>th</i>am, are given in the first Âra<i>n</i>yaka, and more fully in the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka by <i>S</i>aunaka. p. 219 Though they consist of many metres, yet, when one counts the syllables, they give a thousand B<i>ri</i>hatî verses, each consisting of thirty-six syllables.

[^541]: 219:1 Although the Nishkevalya is but one hymn, consisting of eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, yet as these eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as were represented as three kinds of food (see Ait. Âr. II, 1, 2, 2-4), the hymn is represented as three hymns, first as eighty Gâyatrî t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, then as eighty B<i>ri</i>hatî t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, lastly as eighty Ush<i>n</i>ih t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as.

[^542]: 220:1 Vyañ<i>g</i>anâni, explained by kâdini.

[^543]: 220:2 Ghosha, explained by aspirated sonant consonants.

[^544]: 220:3 Âtmâ, explained by madhya<i>s</i>arîram.

[^545]: 220:4 Sashasahâ<i>h</i>. Comm.

[^546]: 220:5 He became Prâ<i>n</i>a, and because Prâ<i>n</i>a causes all to dwell, or covers all (vâsayati), therefore the <i>Ri</i>shi was called Vasish<i>th</i>a. Comm. Cf. Ait. Âr. II, 2, 2, 2.

[^547]: 220:6 At the Subrahma<i>n</i>yâ ceremony in the Soma sacrifices, the invocations are, Indra â ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a, hariva â ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a.

[^548]: 220:7 Cf. Ait. Âr. II, 3, 8, 8.

[^549]: 220:8 Each B<i>ri</i>hatî has thirty-six syllables.
