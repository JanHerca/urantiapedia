FIFTH ADHYÂYA.

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. He recites the Va<i>s</i>a hymn [^475], wishing, May everything be in my power.

2\. They (its verses) are twenty-one [^476], for twenty-one are the parts (the lungs, spleen, &c.) in the belly.

3\. Then the Ekavi<i>m</i>sa is verily the support of all Stomas, and the belly the support of all food.

4\. They consist of different metres. Verily, the intestines are confused, some small, some large.

5\. He recites them with the pra<i>n</i>ava [^477], according to the metre [^478], and according to rule [^479]. Verily, the intestines are according to rule, as it were; some shorter, some longer.

6\. Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is breath. He joins the joints; with breath.

7\. After having recited that verse twelve times he <span id="p194"><sup><small>[ p. 194 ]</small></sup></span> leaves it off there. These prâ<i>n</i>as are verily twelvefold, seven in the head, two on the breast, three below. In these twelve places the prâ<i>n</i>as are contained, there they are perfect. Therefore he leaves it off there [1](Aranyaka_1_5#fn480).

8\. The hymn indrâgnî yuva<i>m</i> su nah (Rv. VIII, 40) forms the two thighs (of the bird) belonging to Indra and Agni, the two supports with broad bones.

9\. These (verses) consist of six feet, so that they may stand firm. Man stands firm on two feet, animals on four. He thus places man (the sacrificer), standing on two feet, among four-footed cattle.

10\. The second verse has seven feet, and he makes it into a Gâyatrî and Anush<i>t</i>ubh. Gâyatrî is Brahman, Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech; and he thus puts together speech with Brahman.

11\. He recites a Trish<i>t</i>ubh at the end. Trish<i>t</i>ubh is strength, and thus does he come round animals by strength. Therefore animals come near where there is strength (of command, &c.); they come to be roused and to rise up, (they obey the commands of a strong shepherd.)

## SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. When he recites the Nishkevalya hymn addressed to Indra (Rv. X, 50), pra vo mahe, he inserts a Nivid [^481] (between the fourth and fifth verses). Thus he clearly places strength in himself (in the <i>s</i>astra, in the bird, in himself).

2\. They are Trish<i>t</i>ubhs and <i>G</i>agatîs. <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> 3\. There they say: ‘Why does he insert a Nivid among mixed Trish<i>t</i>ubhs and <i>G</i>agatîs [^482]?’ But surely one metre would never support the Nivid of this day, nor fill it: therefore he inserts the Nivid among mixed Trish<i>t</i>ubhs and <i>G</i>agatîs.

4\. Let him know that this day has three Nivids: the Vasa hymn is a Nivid, the Vâlakhilyas [^483] are a Nivid, and the Nivid itself is a Nivid. Thus let him know that day as having three Nivids.

5\. Then follow the hymns vane na vâ (Rv. X, 29) and yo <i>g</i>âta eva (Rv. II, 12). In the fourth verse of the former hymn occur the words anne samasya yad asan manîshâ<i>h</i>, and they serve for the winning of proper food.

6\. Then comes an insertion. As many Trish<i>t</i>ubh and <i>G</i>agatî verses [^484], taken from the ten Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>alas and addressed to Indra, as they insert (between the two above-mentioned hymns), after changing them into B<i>ri</i>hatîs, so many years do they live beyond the (usual) age (of one hundred years). By this insertion age is obtained.

7\. After that he recites the Sa<i>g</i>anîya hymn, wishing that cattle may always come to his offspring.

8\. Then he recites the Târkshya hymn [^485]. Târkshya is verily welfare, and the hymn leads to welfare. Thus (by reciting the hymn) he fares well [^486]. <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> 9\. Then he recites the Ekapadâ (indro vi<i>s</i>va<i>m</i> vi râ<i>g</i>ati), wishing, May I be everything at once, and may I thus finish the whole work of metres [^487].

10\. In reciting the hymn indra<i>m</i> vi<i>s</i>vâ aviv<i>ri</i>dhan (Rv. I, 11) he intertwines the first seven verses by intertwining their feet [^488]. There are seven prâ<i>n</i>as (openings) in the head, and he thus places seven prâ<i>n</i>as in the head. The eighth verse (half-verse) he does not intertwine [^489]. The eighth is speech, and he thinks, May my speech never be intertwined with the other prâ<i>n</i>as. Speech therefore, though dwelling in the same abode as the other prâ<i>n</i>as, is not intertwined with them.

11\. He recites the Virâ<i>g</i> verses [^490]. Verily, Virâ<i>g</i> verses are food, and they thus serve for the gaining of food.

12\. He ends with the hymn of Vasish<i>th</i>a [^491], wishing, May I be Vasish<i>th</i>a!

13\. But let him end with the fifth verse, esha stomo maha ugrâya vâhe, which, possessing the word mahat, is auspicious.

14\. In the second foot of the fifth verse the word dhuri occurs. Verily, dhu<i>h</i> (the place where the horse is fastened to the car) is the end (of the car). This day also is the end (of the sacrifice which lasts a whole year) [^492]. Thus the verse is fit for the day. <span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span> 15\. In the third foot the word arka is auspicious.

16\. The last foot is: ‘Make our glory high as heaven over heaven.’ Thus wherever Brahmanic speech is uttered, there his glory will be, when he who knows this finishes with that verse. Therefore let a man who knows this, finish (the Nishkevalya) with that verse.

## THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^493].

1\. Tat savitur v<i>ri</i><i>n</i>îmahe (Rv. V, 82, 1-3) and adyâ no deva savitar (Rv. V, 82, 4-6) are the beginning (pratipad) and the next step (anu<i>k</i>ara) of the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva hymn, taken from the Ekâha ceremonial and therefore proper [^494].

2\. On that day [^495] much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year the sacrificers; rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites this hymn.

3\. Then (follows) the hymn addressed to Savit<i>ri</i>, tad devasya savitur vâryam mahat (Rv. IV, 53). Verily, mahat, great, (in this foot) is the end [^496]. This day too is the end. Thus the verse is fit for the day. <span id="p198"><sup><small>[ p. 198 ]</small></sup></span> 4\. The hymn katarâ pûrvâ katarâ parâyo<i>h</i> (Rv. I, 185), addressed to Dyâvâp<i>ri</i>thivî, is one in which many verses have the same ending. Verily, this day also (the mahâvrata) is one in which many receive the same reward [^497]. Thus it is fit for the day.

5\. The hymn ana<i>s</i>vo <i>g</i>âto anabhî<i>s</i>ur ukthya<i>h</i> (Rv. IV, 36) is addressed to the <i>Ri</i>bhus.

6\. In the first verse the word tri (<i>k</i>akra<i>h</i>) occurs, and trivat [^498] is verily the end. This day also is the end (of the sacrifice). Thus the verse is fit for the day.

7\. The hymn asya vâmasya palitasya hotu<i>h</i> (Rv. I, 164), addressed to the Vi<i>s</i>vedevas, is multiform. This day also is multiform [^499]. Thus the verse is fit for the day.

8\. He recites the end of it, beginning with gaurîr mimâya (Rv. I, 164, 41).

9\. The hymn â no bhadrâ<i>h</i> kratavo yantu vi<i>s</i>vata<i>h</i> (Rv. I, 89), addressed to the Vi<i>s</i>vedevas, forms the Nividdhâna, taken from the Ekâha ceremonial, and therefore proper.

10\. On that day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites this hymn.

11\. The hymn vai<i>s</i>vânarâya dhisha<i>n</i>âm <i>ri</i>tav<i>ri</i>dhe <span id="p199"><sup><small>[ p. 199 ]</small></sup></span> (Rv. III, 2) forms the beginning of the Âgnimâruta. Dhisha<i>n</i>â, thought, is verily the end, this day also is the end. Thus it is fit for the day.

12\. The hymn praya<i>g</i>yavo maruto bhrâ<i>g</i>ad<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>aya<i>h</i> (Rv. V, 55), addressed to the Maruts, is one in which many verses have the same ending. Verily, this day also is one in which many receive the same reward. Thus it is fit for the day [^500].

13\. He recites the verse <i>g</i>âtavedase sunavâma somam (Rv. I, 99, 1), addressed to <i>G</i>âtavedas, before the (next following) hymn. That verse addressed to <i>G</i>âtavedas is verily welfare, and leads to welfare. Thus (by reciting it) he fares well [^501].

14\. The hymn ima<i>m</i> stomam arhate <i>g</i>âtavedase (Rv. I, 94), addressed to <i>G</i>âtavedas, is one in which many verses have the same ending. Verily, this day also (the mahâvrata) is one in which many receive the same reward. Thus it is fit for the day, yea, it is fit for the day.

[^481]: 193:5 According to rule, i.e. so that they should come right as Â<i>s</i>valâyana has prescribed the recitation of Dvipadâ and Ekapadâ verses.
