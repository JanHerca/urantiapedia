THIRD ADHYÂYA [^548].

## FIRST KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. He who knows himself as the fivefold hymn (uktha), the emblem of Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), from whence all this springs [^549], he is clever. These five are the earth, air, ether, water, and fire (<i>g</i>yotis). This is the self, the fivefold uktha. For from him all this springs, and into him it enters again (at the dissolution of the world). He who knows this, becomes the refuge of his friends.

2\. And to him who knows the food (object) and the feeder (subject) in that uktha, a strong son is born, and food is never wanting. Water and earth are food, for all food consists of these two. Fire and air are the feeder, for by means of them [^550] man eats all food. Ether is the bowl, for all this is poured into the ether. He who knows this, becomes the bowl or support of his friends.

3\. To him who knows the food and the feeder in that uktha, a strong son is born, and food is never wanting. Herbs and trees are food, animals the feeder, for animals eat herbs and trees.

4\. Of them again those who have teeth above <span id="p222"><sup><small>[ p. 222 ]</small></sup></span> and below, shaped after the likeness of man, are feeders, the other animals are food. Therefore these overcome the other animals, for the eater is over the food.

5\. He who knows this is over his friends.

## SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A [^551].

1\. He who knows the gradual development of the self in him (the man conceived as the uktha), obtains himself more development.

2\. There are herbs and trees and all that is animated, and he knows the self gradually developing in them. For in herbs and trees sap only is seen [^552], but thought (<i>k</i>itta) in animated beings.

Among animated beings again the self develops gradually, for in some sap (blood) is seen (as well as thought), but in others thought is not seen.

4\. And in man again the self develops gradually, for he is most endowed with knowledge. He says what he has known, he sees what he has known [^553]. He knows what is to happen to-morrow, he knows heaven and hell. By means of the mortal he desires the immortal—thus is he endowed.

5\. With regard to the other animals hunger and thirst only are a kind of understanding. But they do not say what they have known, nor do they see <span id="p223"><sup><small>[ p. 223 ]</small></sup></span> what they have known. They do not know what is to happen to-morrow, nor heaven and hell. They go so far and no further, for they are born according to their knowledge (in a former life).

## THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. That man (conceived as uktha) is the sea, rising beyond the whole world [^554]. Whatever he reaches, he wishes to go beyond [^555]. If he reaches the sky, he wishes to go beyond.

2\. If he should reach that (heavenly) world, he would wish to go beyond.

3\. That man is fivefold. The heat in him is fire; the apertures (of the senses) are ether; blood, mucus, and seed are water; the body is earth; breath is air.

4\. That air is fivefold, viz. up-breathing, down-breathing, back-breathing, out-breathing, on-breathing. The other powers (devatâs), viz. sight, hearing, mind, and speech, are comprised under up-breathing and down-breathing. For when breath departs, they also depart with it.

5\. That man (conceived as uktha) is the sacrifice, which is a succession now of speech and now of thought. That sacrifice is fivefold, viz. the Agnihotra, the new and full moon sacrifices, the four-monthly sacrifices, the animal sacrifice, the Soma sacrifice. The Soma sacrifice is the most perfect of sacrifices, for in it these five kinds of ceremonies are seen: the first which precedes the libations (the Dîkshâ, &c.), then three libations, and what follows (the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha, &c.) is the fifth.

<span id="p224"><sup><small>[ p. 224 ]</small></sup></span>

## FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. He who knows one sacrifice above another, one day above another, one deity above the others, he is clever. Now this great uktha (the nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra) is the sacrifice above another, the day above another, the deity above others [^556].

2\. This uktha is fivefold. With regard to its being performed as a Stoma (chorus), it is Triv<i>ri</i>t, Pañ<i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a, Saptada<i>s</i>a, Ekavi<i>m</i>sa, and Pañ<i>k</i>avi<i>m</i>sa. With regard to its being performed as a Sâman (song), it is Gâyatra, Rathantara, B<i>ri</i>hat, Bhadra, and Râgana. With regard to metre, it is Gâyatrî, Ush<i>n</i>ih, B<i>ri</i>hatî, Trish<i>t</i>ubh, and Dvipadâ. And the explanation (given before in the Âra<i>n</i>yaka) is that it is the head, the right wing, the left wing, the tail, and the body of the bird [^557].

in each hymn. This, is the first round. He then sings the three middle verses in each hymn. This is the second round. He lastly sings the last three verses in each hymn. This is the third round. This song is called Udyatî.

The Pañ<i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a stoma is formed out of one Sûkta only, consisting of three verses. In the first round he sings the first verse p. 225 three times, the second and third once. In the second round he sings the middle verse three times, in the third round he sings the last verse three times. This song is called Vish<i>t</i>uti.

The Saptadasa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the first verse three times, in the second the middle verse three times, in the third round the middle and last verses three times. This song is called Da<i>s</i>asapta.

The Ekavi<i>m</i>sa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the last verse once, in the second the first verse once, in the third the middle verse once, while the other verses are each repeated three times. This song is called Saptasaptinî.

The Pañ<i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the first verse three times, the second four times, the last once; in the second round the first once, the second three times, the third four times; in the third round the first five times, the second once, the last three times; or he sings in the third round the first verse four times, the second twice, the last three times.

Sâya<i>n</i>a in his commentary on the Ait. Âr. takes the Triv<i>ri</i>t stoma to be formed out of three hymns, each consisting of three verses, while he says that the other stomas are formed out of one hymn only. B. and R., s<i>v</i>. triv<i>ri</i>t, state that this stoma consists of verses 1, 4, 7; 2, 5, 8; and 3, 6, 9 of the Rig-veda hymn IX, 11, but, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, the stoma consists (1) of the first verses of the three Sûktas, upâsmai gâyata, davidyutatyâ, and pavamânasya at the beginning of the Sâma-veda-Uttarâr<i>k</i>ika, (2) of the second, (3) Of the third verses of the same three hymns. Mahîdhâra (Yv. X, 9) takes the same view, though the MSS. seem to have left out the description of the second paryâya, while Sâya<i>n</i>a in his commentary to the Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya-brâhma<i>n</i>a seems to support the opinion of B. and R. There is an omission, however, in the printed text of the commentary, which makes it difficult to see the exact meaning of Sâya<i>n</i>a.

The Pañ<i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a stoma is well described by Sâya<i>n</i>a, Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya Br. II, 4. Taking the Sûkta agna â yâhi (Uttarâr<i>k</i>ika I, 1, 4 = Rv. VI, 16, 10-12), he shows the stoma to consist of (1) verse 1 × 3, 2, 3 (2) verse 1, 2 × 3, 3; (3) verse 1, 2, 3 × 3.

The five Sâmans are explained by the commentator. The p. 226 Gâyatra is formed out of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (III, 62, 10) tat savitur vare<i>n</i>yam. The Rathantara is formed out of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (VII, 32, 22) abhi tvâ <i>s</i>ûra nonuma. The B<i>ri</i>hat is formed out of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (VI, 46, 1) tvâm id dhi havâmahe. The Bhadra is formed out of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (X, 57, 1) imâ nu kam. The Râ<i>g</i>ana is formed out of the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (VII, 27, 1) indram naro nemadhitâ.

The metres require no explanation.

In identifying certain portions of the Nishkevalya hymn with a bird, the head of the bird corresponds to the hymns indram id gâthina<i>h</i>, &c.; the right wing to the hymns abhi tvâ <i>s</i>ûra, &c.; the left wing to the hymns tvâm id dhi, &c.; the tail to the hymns imâ nu kam, &c.; the body to the hymns tad id âsa, &c. All this was explained in the first Âra<i>n</i>yaka. <span id="p225"><sup><small>[ p. 225 ]</small></sup></span> 3\. He performs the Prastâva in five ways, he performs the Udgîtha in five ways, he performs the <span id="p226"><sup><small>[ p. 226 ]</small></sup></span> Pratihâra in five ways, he performs the Upadrava in five ways, he performs the Nidhana in five ways [^559]. All this together forms one thousand Stobhas, or musical syllables [^560].

4\. Thus also are the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses, contained in the Nishkevalya, recited (by the Hot<i>ri</i>) in five orders. What precedes the eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, that is one order, then follow the three sets of eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as each, and what comes after is the fifth order [^561]. <span id="p227"><sup><small>[ p. 227 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. This (the hymns of this Sastra) as a whole (if properly counted with the Stobha syllables) comes to one thousand (of B<i>ri</i>hatî verses). That (thousand) is the whole, and ten, ten is called the whole. For number is such (measured by ten). Ten tens are a hundred, ten hundreds are a thousand, and that is the whole. These are the three metres (the tens, pervading everything). And this food also (the three sets of hymns being represented as food) is threefold, eating, drinking, and chewing. He obtains that food by those (three numbers, ten, hundred, and thousand, or by the three sets of eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as).

## FIFTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. This (nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra) becomes perfect as a thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatî verses.

2\. Some teachers (belonging to a different Sâkhâ) recognise a thousand of different metres (not of B<i>ri</i>hatîs only). They say: ‘Is another thousand (a thousand of other verses) good? Let us say it is good.’

3\. Some say, a thousand of Trish<i>t</i>ubh verses, others a thousand of <i>G</i>agatî verses, others a thousand of Anush<i>t</i>ubh verses.

4\. This has been said by a <i>Ri</i>shi (Rv. X, 124, 9):—

5\. ‘Poets through their understanding discovered Indra dancing an Anush<i>t</i>ubh.’ This is meant to say: They discovered (and meditated) in speech (called Anush<i>t</i>ubh)—at that time (when they worshipped <span id="p228"><sup><small>[ p. 228 ]</small></sup></span> the uktha)—the Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath) connected with Indra.

6\. He (who takes the recited verses as Anush<i>t</i>ubhs) is able to become celebrated and of good report.

7\. No! he says; rather is such a man liable to die before his time. For that self (consisting of Anush<i>t</i>ubhs) is incomplete. For if a man confines himself to speech, not to breath, then driven by his mind, he does not succeed with speech [^562].

8\. Let him work towards the B<i>ri</i>hatî, for the B<i>ri</i>hatî (breath) is the complete self.

9\. That self (<i>g</i>îvâtman) is surrounded on all sides by members. And as that self is on all sides surrounded by members, the B<i>ri</i>hatî also is on all sides surrounded by metres [^563].

10\. For the self (in the heart) is the middle of these members, and the B<i>ri</i>hatî is the middle of the metres.

11\. ‘He is able to become celebrated and of good <span id="p229"><sup><small>[ p. 229 ]</small></sup></span> report, but (the other) able to die before his time,’ thus he said. For the B<i>ri</i>hatî is the complete self, therefore let him work towards the B<i>ri</i>hatî (let him reckon the <i>s</i>astra recitation as a thousand B<i>ri</i>hatîs).

## SIXTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. This (nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra) becomes perfect as a thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatî verses. In this thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatîs there are one thousand one hundred and twenty-five Anush<i>t</i>ubhs. For the smaller is contained in the larger.

2\. This has been said by a <i>Ri</i>shi (Rv. VIII, 76, 12):—

3\. ‘A speech of eight feet;’—because there are eight feet of four syllables each in the Anush<i>t</i>ubh.

4\. ‘Of nine corners;’—because the B<i>ri</i>hatî becomes nine-cornered (having nine feet of four syllables each).

5\. ‘Touching the truth;’—because speech (Anush<i>t</i>ubh) is truth, touched by the verse (B<i>ri</i>hatî) [^564].

6\. 'He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) makes the body out of Indra;—'for out of this thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatî verses turned into Anush<i>t</i>ubhs, and therefore out of Prâ<i>n</i>a as connected with Indra [^565], and out of the B<i>ri</i>hatî (which is Prâ<i>n</i>a), he makes speech, that is Anush<i>t</i>ubh, as a body [^566].

7\. This Mahaduktha is the highest development <span id="p230"><sup><small>[ p. 230 ]</small></sup></span> of speech, and it is fivefold, viz. measured, not measured, music, true, and untrue.

8\. A <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verse, a gâthâ [^567], a kumbyâ [^568] are measured (metrical). A Ya<i>g</i>us line, an invocation, and general remarks [^569], these are not measured (they are in prose). A Sâman, or any portion (parvan) of it, is music. Om is true, Na is untrue.

9\. What is true (Om) is the flower and fruit of speech. He is able to become celebrated and of good report, for he speaks the true (Om), the flower and fruit of speech.

10\. Now the untrue is the root [^570] of speech, and as a tree whose root is exposed dries up and perishes, thus a man who says what is untrue exposes his root, dries up and perishes. Therefore one should not say what is untrue, but guard oneself from it.

11\. That syllable Om (yes) goes forward (to the first cause of the world) and is empty. Therefore if a man says Om (yes) to everything, then that (which he gives away) is wanting to him here [^571]. If he says Om (yes) to everything, then he would empty himself, and would not be capable of any enjoyments.

12\. That syllable Na (no) is full for oneself [^572]. If a man says No to everything, then his reputation <span id="p231"><sup><small>[ p. 231 ]</small></sup></span> would become evil, and that would ruin him even here.

13\. Therefore let a man give at the proper time only, not at the wrong time. Thus he unites the true and the untrue, and from the union of those two he grows, and becomes greater and greater.

14\. He who knows this speech of which this (the mahaduktha) is a development, he is clever. A is the whole of speech, and manifested through different kinds of contact (mutes) and of wind (sibilants), it becomes manifold and different.

15\. Speech if uttered in a whisper is breath, if spoken aloud, it is body. Therefore (if whispered) it is almost hidden, for what is incorporeal is almost hidden, and breath is incorporeal. But if spoken aloud, it is body, and therefore it is perceptible, for body is perceptible.

## SEVENTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. This (nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra) becomes perfect as a thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatîs. It is glory (the glorious Brahman, not the absolute Brahman), it is Indra. Indra is the lord of all beings. He who thus knows Indra as the lord of all beings, departs from this world by loosening the bonds of life [^573]\—so said Mahidâsa Aitareya. Having departed he becomes Indra (or Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha) and shines in those worlds [^574]. <span id="p232"><sup><small>[ p. 232 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. And with regard to this they say: ‘If a man obtains the other world in this form (by meditating on the prâ<i>n</i>a, breath, which is the uktha, the hymn of the mahâvrata), then in what form does he obtain this world [1](../Aranyaka_2_3#fn575)?’

3\. Here the blood of the woman is a form of Agni (fire); therefore no one should despise it. And the seed of the man is a form of Âditya (sun); therefore no one should despise it. This self (the woman) gives her self (skin, blood, and flesh) to that self (fat, bone, and marrow), and that self (man) gives his self (fat, bone, and marrow) to this self (skin, blood, and flesh). Thus [2](../Aranyaka_2_3#fn576) these two grow together. In this form (belonging to the woman and to fire) he goes to that world (belonging to the man and the sun), and in that form (belonging to man and the sun) he goes to this world (belonging to the woman and to fire [3](../Aranyaka_2_3#fn577)).

## EIGHTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A.

1\. Here (with regard to obtaining Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha) there are these <i>S</i>lokas: <span id="p233"><sup><small>[ p. 233 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. The fivefold body into which the indestructible (prâ<i>n</i>a, breath) enters, that body which the harnessed horses (the senses) draw about, that body where the true of the true (the highest Brahman) follows after, in that body (of the worshipper) all gods [^578] become one.

3\. That body into which goes the indestructible (the breath) which we have joined (in meditation), proceeding from the indestructible (the highest Brahman), that body which the harnessed horses (the senses) draw about, that body where the true of the true follows after, in that body all gods become one.

4\. After separating themselves from the Yes and No of language, and of all that is hard and cruel, poets have discovered (what they sought for); dependent on names they rejoiced in what had been revealed [^579].

5\. That in which the poets rejoiced (the revealed nature of prâ<i>n</i>a, breath), in it the gods exist all joined together. Having driven away evil by means of that Brahman (which is hidden in prâ<i>n</i>a), the enlightened man goes to the Svarga world (becomes one with Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha [^580], the universal spirit).

6\. No one wishing to describe him (prâ<i>n</i>a, breath) by speech, describes him by calling him ‘woman,’ ‘neither woman nor man,’ or ‘man’ (all such names applying only to the material body, and not to prâ<i>n</i>a or breath). <span id="p234"><sup><small>[ p. 234 ]</small></sup></span> 7\. Brahman (as hidden beneath prâ<i>n</i>a) is called the A; and the I (ego) is gone there (the worshipper should know that he is uktha and prâ<i>n</i>a).

8\. This becomes perfect as a thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatî verses, and of that hymn, perfect with a thousand Brihad verses, there are 36,000 syllables. So many are also the thousands of days of human life [^581]. By means of the syllable of life (the a) alone (which is contained in that thousand of hymns) does a man obtain the day of life (the mahâvrata day, which completes the number of the days in the Gavâmayana, sacrifice), and by means of the day of life (he obtains) the syllable of life.

9\. Now there is a chariot of the god (prâ<i>n</i>a) destroying all desires (for the worlds of Indra, the moon, the earth, all of which lie below the place of Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha). Its front part (the point of the two shafts of the carriage where the yoke is fastened) is speech, its wheels the cars, the horses the eyes, the driver the mind. Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath) mounts that chariot (and on it, i. e. by means of meditating on Prâ<i>n</i>a, he reaches Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha).

10\. This has been said by a <i>Ri</i>shi (Rv. X, 39, 12):—

11\. ‘Come hither on that which is quicker than mind,’ and (Rv. VIII, 73, 2) ‘Come hither on that which is quicker than the twinkling of an eye,’ yea, the twinkling of an eye [^582].

## Footnotes

[^550]: 221:1 In this adhyâya some more qualities are explained belonging to the Mahâvrata ceremonial and the hymns employed at it, which can be meditated on as referring to Prâ<i>n</i>a, life.

[^551]: 221:2 Because the world is the result or reward for performing a meditation on the uktha. Comm.

[^552]: 221:3 The digestive fire is lighted by the air of the breath. Comm.

[^553]: 222:1 This treats of the gradual development of life in man, particularly of the development of a thinking soul (<i>k</i>aitanya).

[^554]: 222:2 In stones there is not even sap, but only being, sattâ. Comm.

[^555]: 222:3 What he has known yesterday he remembers, and is able to say before men, I know this. And when he has known a thing he remembers it, and goes to the same place to see it again. Comm.

[^556]: 223:1 Bhûloka. Comm.

[^557]: 223:2 Should it not be aty enan manyate?

[^558]: 224:1 The uktha is to be conceived as prâ<i>n</i>a, breath or life, and this prâ<i>n</i>a was shown to be above the other powers (devatâs), speech, hearing, seeing, mind. The uktha belongs to the Mahâvrata day, and that is the most important day of the Soma sacrifice. The Soma sacrifice, lastly, is above all other sacrifices.

[^559]: 224:2 All these are technicalities connected with the singing and reciting of the uktha. The commentator says: The stoma is a collection of single <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> verses occurring in the t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as which have to be sung. The Triv<i>ri</i>t stoma, as explained in the Sâma-brâhma<i>n</i>a, is as follows: There are three Sûktas, each consisting of three verses, the first being upâsmai gâyata, S. V. Uttarâr<i>k</i>ika I, 1, 1 = Rv. IX, 11. The Udgât<i>ri</i> first sings the first three verses [^558]

[^560]: 224:a Hiṅk<i>ri</i> with dative is explained as gai with accusative.

[^561]: 226:1 The Sâmagas sing the Râ<i>g</i>ana at the Mahâvrata, and in that Sâman there are, as usual, five parts, the Prastâva, Udgîtha, pratihâra, Upadrava, and Nidhana. The Prastot<i>ri</i>, when singing the Prastâva portions, sings them five times. The Udgât<i>ri</i> and Pratihart<i>ri</i> sing their portions, the Udgîtha and Pratihâra, five times. The Udgât<i>ri</i> again sings the Upadrava five times. And all the Udgât<i>ri</i>s together sing the Nidhana five times.

[^562]: 226:2 The Stobha syllables are syllables without any meaning, added when verses have to be sung, in order to have a support for the music. See <i>Kh</i>. Up. I, 13. In singing the five Sâmans, each five times, one thousand of such Stobha syllables are required.

[^563]: 226:3 There are in the Nishkevalya hymn, which the Hot<i>ri</i> has to recite, three sets of eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as each. The first, consisting of Gâyatrîs, begins with ![](/image/book/Hinduism/The_Upanishads_Part_I/22600.jpg) indro ya o<i>g</i>asâ. The second, consisting of B<i>ri</i>hatîs, begins with ya <i>k</i>id anyad. The third, consisting of Ush<i>n</i>ihs, begins with ya indra somapâtama. These three sets form the food of the bird, as the emblem of the <i>s</i>astra. The hymns p. 227 which precede these, form the body, head, and wings of the bird. This is one order. Then follow the three sets of eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as each; and lastly, the fifth order, consisting of the hymns which form the belly and the legs of the bird.

[^564]: 228:1 This passage is obscure, and probably corrupt. I have followed the commentator as much as possible. He says: ‘If the Hot<i>ri</i> priest proceeds with reciting the <i>s</i>astra, looking to the Anush<i>t</i>ubh, which is speech, and not to the thousand of B<i>ri</i>hatîs which are breath, then, neglecting the B<i>ri</i>hatî (breath), and driven by his mind to the Anush<i>t</i>ubh (speech), he does not by his speech obtain that <i>s</i>astra. For in speech without breath the Hot<i>ri</i> cannot, through the mere wish of the mind, say the <i>s</i>astra, the activity of all the senses being dependent on breath.’ The commentator therefore takes vâgabhi for vâ<i>k</i>am abhi, or for some old locative case formed by abhi. He also would seem to have read prâ<i>n</i>e na. One might attempt another construction, though it is very doubtful. One might translate, ‘For that self, which is speech, is incomplete, because he understands if driven to the mind by breath, not (if driven) by speech.’

[^565]: 228:2 Either in the <i>s</i>astra, or in the list of metres, there being some that have more, others that have less syllables.

[^566]: 229:1 Vâ<i>k</i>, speech, taking the form of Anush<i>t</i>ubh, and being joined with the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, or the B<i>ri</i>hatî, touches the true, i. e. Prâ<i>n</i>a, breath, which is to be meditated on under the form of the B<i>ri</i>hatî. Comm.

[^567]: 229:2 Cf. Ait. Âr. II, 2, 3, 4.

[^568]: 229:3 Because the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is made out of the B<i>ri</i>hatî, the B<i>ri</i>hatî being breath, therefore the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is called its body.

[^569]: 230:1 A gâthâ is likewise in verse, for instance, prâta<i>h</i> prâtar an<i>ri</i>ta<i>m</i> te vadanti.

[^570]: 230:2 A kumbyâ is a metrical precept, such as, brahma<i>k</i>âryasyâpo<i>s</i>âna<i>m</i> karma kuru, divi ma svâpsî<i>h</i>, &c.

[^571]: 230:3 Such as arthavâdas, explanatory passages, also gossip, such as is common in the king's palace, laughing at people, &c.

[^572]: 230:4 As diametrically opposed to the flowers and fruits which represent the true. Comm.

[^573]: 230:5 Then that man is left empty here on earth for that enjoyment. Comm.

[^574]: 230:6 He who always says No, keeps everything to himself.

[^575]: 231:1 The commentator explains visrasâ by ‘merging his manhood in the identity with all,’ and doing this while still alive. Visras is the gradual loosening of the body, the decay of old age, but here it has the meaning of vairâgya rather, the shaking off of all that ties the Self to this body or this life.

[^576]: 231:2 The fourteen worlds in the egg of Brahman. Comm. Some hold that he who enters on this path, and becomes deity, does not p. 232 arrive at final liberation. Others, however, show that this identification with the uktha, and through it with the prâ<i>n</i>a (breath) and Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, is provisional only, and intended to prepare the mind of the worshipper for the reception of the highest knowledge of Brahman.

[^577]: 232:1 The last line on page 246 should, I think, be the penultimate line of page 247.

[^578]: 232:2 The body consists of six elements, and is hence called shâ<i>t</i>kau<i>s</i>ika. Of these, three having a white appearance (fat, bone, and marrow), come from the sun and from man; three having a. red appearance, come from fire and from the woman.

[^579]: 232:3 It is well therefore to shake off this body, and by meditating on the uktha to obtain identity with Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha. Comm.

[^580]: 233:1 The worshipper identifies himself by meditation with prâ<i>n</i>a, breath, which comprehends all gods. These gods (Agni and the rest) appear in the forms of speech, &c. Comm.

[^581]: 233:2 The prâ<i>n</i>a, breath, and their identity with it through meditation or worship. Comm.

[^582]: 233:3 Sarvâhammânî hira<i>n</i>yagarbha iti <i>s</i>rute<i>h</i>. Comm.

[^583]: 234:1 Cf. 11, 2, 4, 4.

[^584]: 234:2 The commentator remarks that the worship and meditation on the uktha as prâ<i>n</i>a, as here taught, is different from the prâ<i>n</i>avidyâ, the knowledge of prâ<i>n</i>a, taught in the <i>Kh</i>ândogya, the B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, &c., where prâ<i>n</i>a or life is represented as the object of meditation, without any reference to the uktha or other portions of the Mahâvrata ceremony. He enjoins that the meditation on p. 235 the uktha as prâ<i>n</i>a should be continued till the desired result, the identification of the worshipper with prâ<i>n</i>a, is realised, and that it should afterwards be repeated until death, because otherwise the impression might vanish, and the reward of becoming a god, and going to the gods, be lost. Nor is the worship to be confined to the time of the sacrifice, the Mahâvrata, only, but it has to be repeated mentally during life. There are neither certain postures required for it, nor certain times and places. At the time of death, however, he who has become perfect in this meditation on uktha, as the emblem of prâ<i>n</i>a, will have his reward. Up to a certain point his fate will be the same as that of other people. The activity of the senses will be absorbed in the mind, the activity of the mind in breath, breath in the activity of life, life with breath in the five elements, fire, &c., and these five elements will be absorbed up to their seed in the Paramâtman or Highest Self. This ends the old birth. But then the subtile body, having been absorbed in the Highest Self, rises again in the lotus of the heart, and passing out by the channel of the head, reaches a ray of the sun, whether by day or by night, and goes at the northern or southern course of the sun to the road of Ar<i>k</i>is or light. That Ar<i>k</i>is, light, and other powers carry him on, and led by these he reaches the Brahma-loka, where he creates to himself every kind of enjoyment, according to his wish. He may create for himself a material body and enjoy all sorts of pleasures, as if in a state of waking, or he may, without such a body, enjoy all pleasures in mind only, as if in a dream. And as he creates these various bodies according to his wish, he creates also living souls in each, endowed with the internal organs of mind, and moves about in them, as he pleases. In fact this world is the same for the devotee (yogin) and for the Highest Self, except that creative power belongs truly to the latter only. At last the devotee gains the highest knowledge, that of the Highest Self in himself, and then, at the dissolution of the Brahma-loka, he obtains complete freedom with Brahman.
