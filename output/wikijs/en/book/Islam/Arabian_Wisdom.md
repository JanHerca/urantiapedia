This short collection of Islamic wisdom literature was originally published in the Wisdom of the East Series. It features gems from the Quran, the Hadith, and traditional proverbs and aphorisms. This is principally meant as an enjoyable read; unfortunately the sayings are unattributed, which makes it less useful as a scholarly work.
