_Thus said the Poet: “When Death comes to you,_
_All ye whose life-sand through the hour-glass slips,_
_He lays two fingers on your ears, and two_
_Upon your eyes he lays, one on your lips,_
_Whispering: Silence!” Although deaf thine ear,_
_Thine eye, my Hafiz, suffer Time's eclipse,_
_The songs thou sangest still all men may hear._

_Songs of dead laughter, songs of love once hot,_
_Songs of a cup once flushed rose-red with wine,_
_Songs of a rose whose beauty is forgot,_
_A nightingale that piped hushed lays divine:_
_And still a graver music runs beneath_
_The tender love notes of those songs of thine,_
_Oh, Seeker of the keys of Life and Death!_

_While thou wert singing, the soft summer wind_
_That o’er Mosalla's garden blew, the stream_
_Of Ruknabad flowing where roses twined,_
_Carried thy voice farther than thou could’st dream._
_To Isfahan and Baghdad's Tartar horde,_
_O’er waste and sea to Yezd and distant Ind;_
_Yea, to the sun-setting they bore thy word._

_Behold we laugh, we warm us at Love's fire,_
_We thirst and scarce dare tell what wine we crave,_
_We lift our voices in Grief's dark-robed choir;_
_Sing thou the wisdom joy and sorrow gave!_
_If my poor rhymes held aught of the heart's lore,_
_Fresh wreaths were theirs to lay upon thy grave—_
_Master and Poet, all was thine before!_
