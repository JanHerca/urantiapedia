## I

Abandon worship in the mosque and shrink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From idle prayer, from sacrificial sheep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Destiny will bring the bowl of sleep
Or bowl of tribulation——you shall drink.

## II

The scarlet eyes of Morning are pursued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Night, who growls along the narrow lane;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as they crash upon our world the twain
Devour us and are strengthened for the feud.

## III

Vain are your dreams of marvellous emprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly you sail among uncharted spaces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly seek harbour in this world of faces
If it has been determined otherwise.

<span id="p35"><sup><small>[ p. 35 ]</small></sup></span>

## IV

Behold, my friends, there is reserved for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendour of our traffic with the sky:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You pay your court to Saturn, whereas I
Am slain by One far mightier than he.

## V

You that must travel with a weary load
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along this darkling, labyrinthine street——
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have men with torches at your head and feet
If you would pass the dangers of the road.

## VI

So shall you find all armour incomplete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And open to the whips of circumstance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so shall you be girdled of mischance
Till you be folded in the winding-sheet.

## VII

Have conversation with the wind that goes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing a pack of loveliness and pain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden exultation of the grain
And the last, sacred whisper of the rose

## VIII

But if in some enchanted garden bloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rose imperial that will not fade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! shall I go with desecrating spade
And underneath her glories build a tomb?

<span id="p36"><sup><small>[ p. 36 ]</small></sup></span>

## IX

Shall I that am as dust upon the plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think with unloosened hurricanes to fight?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or shall I that was ravished from the night
Fall on the bosom of the night again?

## X

Endure! and if you rashly would unfold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That manuscript whereon our lives are traced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall the stream which carols thro’ the waste
And in the dark is rich with alien gold.

## XI

Myself did linger by the ragged beach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat wave after wave did rise and curl;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they fell, they fell—I saw them hurl
A message far more eloquent than speech:

## XII

_We that with song our pilgrimage beguile,_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_With purple islands which a sunset bore,_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_We, sunk upon the sacrilegious shore,_
_May parley with oblivion awhile._

## XIII

I would not have you keep nor idly flaunt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What may be gathered from the gracious land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would have you sow with sleepless hand
The virtues that will balance your account.

<span id="p37"><sup><small>[ p. 37 ]</small></sup></span>

## XIV

The days are dressing all of us in white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him who will suspend us in a row.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the sun there is no death. I know
The centuries are morsels of the night.

## XV

A deed magnanimous, a noble thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are as the music singing thro’ the years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When surly Time the tyrant domineers
Against the lute whereoutof it was wrought.

## XVI

Now to the Master of the World resign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever touches you, what is prepared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many sons of wisdom are ensnared
And many fools in happiness recline.

## XVII

Long have I tarried where the waters roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From undeciphered caverns of the main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have searched, and I have searched in vain,
Where I could drown the sorrows of my soul.

## XVIII

If I have harboured love within my breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Twas for my comrades of the dusty day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with me watched the loitering stars at play,
Who bore the burden of the same unrest,

<span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span>

## XIX

For once the witcheries a maiden flung——
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then afterwards I knew she was the bride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Death; and as he came, so tender-eyed,
I—I rebuked him roundly, being young.

## XX

Yet if all things that vanish in their noon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are but the part of some eternal scheme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what the nightingale may chance to dream
Or what the lotus murmurs to the moon !

## XXI

Have I not heard sagacious ones repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An irresistibly grim argument:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we for all our blustering content
Are as the silent shadows at our feet.

## XXII

Aye, when the torch is low and we prepare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the notes of revelry to pass——
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Silence will keep watch upon the grass,
The solemn shadows will assemble there.

## XXIII

No Sultan at his pleasure shall erect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwelling less obedient to decay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I, whom all the mysteries obey,
Build with the twilight for an architect,

<span id="p39"><sup><small>[ p. 39 ]</small></sup></span>

## XXIV

Dark leans to dark! the passions of a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are twined about all transitory things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For verily the child of wisdom clings
More unto dreamland than Arabistan.

## XXV

Death leans to death! nor shall your vigilance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevent him from whate’er he would possess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, brother, shall unfilial peevishness
Prevent you from the grand inheritance.

## XXVI

Farewell, my soul!—bird in the narrow jail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cannot sing. The door is opened! Fly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, soon you stop, and looking down you cry
The saddest song of all, poor nightingale.

## XXVII

Our fortune is like mariners to float
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the perils of dim waterways;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall then our seamanship have aught of praise
If the great anchor drags behind the boat?

## XXVIII

Ah! let the burial of yesterday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of yesterday be ruthlessly decreed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if you will, refuse the mourner’s reed,
And, if you will, plant cypress in the way.

<span id="p40"><sup><small>[ p. 40 ]</small></sup></span>

## XXIX

As little shall it serve you in the fight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remonstrate with the storming seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if you querulously sigh to these
Of some imagined haven of delight.

## XXX

Steed of my soul! when you and I were young
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lived to cleave as arrows thro’ the night,——
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is ta’en from me the last of light,
And wheresoe’er I gaze a veil is hung.

## XXXI

No longer as a wreck shall I be hurled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where beacons lure the fascinated helm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have been admitted to the realm
Of darkness that encompasses the world.

## XXXII

Man has been thought superior to the swarm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ruminating cows, of witless foals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, crouching when the voice of thunder rolls,
Are banqueted upon a thunderstorm.

## XXXIII

But shall the fearing eyes of humankind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have peeped beyond the curtain and excel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boldness of a wondering gazelle
Or of a bird imprisoned in the wind?

<span id="p41"><sup><small>[ p. 41 ]</small></sup></span>

## XXXIV

Ah! never may we hope to win release
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we that unripeness overthrow,——
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So must the corn in agitation grow
Before the sickle sings the songs of peace.

## XXXV

Lo! there are many ways and many traps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many guides, and which of them is lord?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For verily Mahomet has the sword,
And he may have the truth—perhaps! _perhaps!_

## XXXVI

Now this religion happens to prevail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until by that religion overthrown,—
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because men dare not live with men alone,
But always with another fairy-tale.

## XXXVII

Religion is a charming girl, I say;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But over this poor threshold will not pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I may not unveil her, and alas!
The bridal gift I can’t afford to pay.

## XXXVIII

I have imagined that our welfare is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required to rise triumphant from defeat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the musk, which as the more you beat,
Gives ever more delightful fragrancies.

<span id="p42"><sup><small>[ p. 42 ]</small></sup></span>

## XXXIX

For as a gate of sorrow-land unbars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region of unfaltering delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So may you gather from the fields of night
That harvest of diviner thought, the stars.

## XL

Send into banishment whatever blows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the waves of your tempestuous heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let every wish save Allah’s wish depart,
And you will have ineffable repose.

## XLI

My faith it is that all the wanton pack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of living shall be—hush, poor heart!—withdrawn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As even to the camel comes a dawn
Without a burden for his wounded back.

## XLII

If there should be some truth in what they teach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of unrelenting Monkar and Nakyr,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before whose throne all buried men appear——
Then give me to the vultures, I beseech.

## XLIII

Some yellow sand all hunger shall assuage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for my thirst no cloud have need to roll,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ah! the drooping bird which is my soul
No longer shall be prisoned in the cage.

<span id="p43"><sup><small>[ p. 43 ]</small></sup></span>

## XLIV

Life is a flame that flickers in the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bird that crouches in the fowler’s net—
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor may between her flutterings forget
That hour the dreams of youth were unconfined.

## XLV

There was a time when I was fain to guess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riddles of our life, when I would soar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the cruel secrets of the door,
So that I fell to deeper loneliness.

## XLVI

One is behind the draperies of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One who will tear these tanglements away—
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No dark assassin, for the dawn of day
Leaps out, as leapeth laughter, from the knife.

## XLVII

If you will do some deed before you die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember not this caravan of death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But have belief that every little breath
Will stay with you for an eternity.

## XLVIII

Astrologers!—give ear to what they say!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stars be words; they float on heaven’s breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faithfully reveal the days of death,
And surely will reveal that longer day."

<span id="p44"><sup><small>[ p. 44 ]</small></sup></span>

## XLIX

I shook the trees of knowledge. Ah! the fruit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fair upon the bleakness of the soil.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I filled a hundred vessels with my spoil,
And then I rested from the grand pursuit.

## L

Alas! I took me servants: I was proud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of prose and of the neat, the cunning rhyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all their inclination was the crime
Of scattering my treasure to the crowd.

## LI

And yet—and yet this very seed I throw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May rise aloft, a brother of the bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncaring if his melodies are heard——
Or shall I not hear anything below?

## LII

The glazier out of sounding Erzerûm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequented us and softly would conspire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon our broken glass with blue-red fire,
As one might lift a pale thing from the tomb.

## LIII

He was the glazier out of Erzerûm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose wizardry would make the children cry——
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no such wizardry when I
Am broken by the chariot-wheels of Doom.

<span id="p45"><sup><small>[ p. 45 ]</small></sup></span>

## LIV

The chariot-wheels of Doom! Now, hear them roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the desert and the noisy mart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the silent places of your heart——
Smile on the driver you will not cajole.

## LV

I never look upon the placid plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must think of those who lived before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave their quantities of sweat and gore,
And went and will not travel back again.

## LVI

Aye! verily, the fields of blandishment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shepherds meditate among their cattle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the direst of the fields of battle,
For in the victor’s train there is no tent.

## LVII

Where are the doctors who were nobly fired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loved their toil because we ventured not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who spent their lives in searching for the spot
To which the generations have retired?

## LVIII

“Great is your soul,”—these are the words they preach,—
  "It passes from your framework to the frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of others, and upon this road of shame
Turns purer and more pure."—Oh, let them teach!

<span id="p46"><sup><small>[ p. 46 ]</small></sup></span>

## LIX

I look on men as I would look on trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That may be writing in the purple dome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romantic lines of black, and are at home
Where lie the little garden hostelries.

## LX

Live well! Be wary of this life, I say;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not o’erload yourself with righteousness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold! the sword we polish in excess,
We gradually polish it away.

## LXI

God who created metal is the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will devour it. As the warriors ride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With iron horses and with iron pride——
Come, let us laugh into the merry flame.

## LXII

But for the grandest flame our God prepares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breast of man, which is the grandest urn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet is that flame so powerless to burn
Those butterflies, the swarm of little cares.

## LXIII

And if you find a solitary sage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who teaches what is truth—ah, then you find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of men, the guardian of the wind,
The victor of all armies and of age.

<span id="p47"><sup><small>[ p. 47 ]</small></sup></span>

## LXIV

See that procession passing down the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black and white procession of the days——
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far better dance along and bawl your praise
Than if you follow with unwilling feet.

## LXV

But in the noisy ranks you will forget
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the flag. Oh, comrade, fall aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think a little moment of the pride
Of yonder sun, think of the twilight’s net.

## LXVI

The songs we fashion from our new delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are echoes. When the first of men sang out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shuddered, hearing not alone the shout
Of hills but of the peoples in the night.

## LXVII

And all the marvels that our eyes behold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are pictures. There has happened some event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each of them, and this they represent——
Our lives are like a tale that has been told.

## LXVIII

There is a palace, and the ruined wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divides the sand, a very home of tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where love whispered of a thousand years
The silken-footed caterpillars crawl.

<span id="p48"><sup><small>[ p. 48 ]</small></sup></span>

## LXIX

And where the Prince commanded, now the shriek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wind is flying through the court of state:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here,” it proclaims, "there dwelt a potentate
Who could not hear the sobbing of the weak."

## LXX

Beneath our palaces the corner-stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is quaking. What of noble we possess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In love or courage or in tenderness,
Can rise from our infirmities alone.

## LXXI

We suffer—that we know, and that is all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our knowledge. If we recklessly should strain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sweep aside the solid rocks of pain,
Then would the domes of love and courage fall.

## LXXII

But there is one who trembles at the touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sorrow less than all of you, for he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has got the care of no big treasury,
And with regard to wits not overmuch.

## LXXIII

I think our world is not a place of rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where a man may take his little ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the landlord whom he never sees
Gives that apartment to another guest.

<span id="p49"><sup><small>[ p. 49 ]</small></sup></span>

## LXXIV

Say that you come to life as ’twere a feast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared to pay whatever is the bill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of death or tears or——surely, friend, you wilt
Not shrink at death, which is among the least?

## LXXV

Rise up against your troubles, cast away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is too great for mortal man to bear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seize no foolish arms against the share
Which you the piteous mortal have to pay.

## LXXVI

Be gracious to the King. You canot feign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nobody was tyrant, that the sword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of justice always gave the just award
Before these Ghassanites began to reign.

## LXXVII

You cultivate the ranks of golden grain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cultivates the cavaliers. They go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him careering on some other foe,
And your battalions will be staunch again.

## LXXVIII

The good law and the bad law disappear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the flood of custom, or they float
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like the wonderful Sar’aby coat,
They captivate us for a little year.

<span id="p50"><sup><small>[ p. 50 ]</small></sup></span>

## LXXIX

God pities him who pities. Ah, pursue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer now the children of the wood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or have you not, poor huntsman, understood
That somebody is overtaking you?

## LXXX

God is above. We never shall attain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our liberty from hands that overshroud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or can we shake aside this heavy cloud
More than a slave can shake aside the chain?

## LXXXI

“There is no God save Allah!”—that is true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is there any prophet save the mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of man who wanders through the dark to find
The Paradise that is in me and you.

## LXXXII

The rolling, ever-rolling years of time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are as a diwan of Arabian song;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet, headstrong and supremely strong,
Refuses to repeat a single rhyme.

## LXXXIII

An archer took an arrow in his hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fair he sent it singing to the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he brought justice down from—ah, so high!
He was an archer in the morning land.

<span id="p51"><sup><small>[ p. 51 ]</small></sup></span>

## LXXXIV

The man who shot his arrow from the west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made empty roads of air; yet have I thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our life was happier until we brought
This cold one of the skies to rule the nest.

## LXXXV

Run! follow, follow happiness, the maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose laughter is the laughing waterfall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run! call to her—but if no maiden call,
’Tis something to have loved the flying shade.

## LXXXVI

You strut in piety the while you take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pilgrimage to Mecca. Now beware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For starving relatives befoul the air,
And curse, O fool, the threshold you forsake.

## LXXXVII

How man is made! He staggers at the voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little voice that leads you to the land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of virtue; but, on hearing the command
To lead a giant army, will rejoice.

## LXXXVIII

Behold the cup whereon your slave has trod;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what every cup is falling to.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your slave—remember that he lives by you,
While in the form of him we bow to God.

<span id="p52"><sup><small>[ p. 52 ]</small></sup></span>

## LXXXIX

The lowliest of the people is the lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows not where each day to make his bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose crown is kept upon the royal head
By that poor naked minister, the sword.

## XC

Which is the tyrant? say you. Well, ’tis he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has the vine-leaf strewn among his hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will deliver countries to the care
Of courtesans——but I am vague, you see.

## XCI

The dwellers of the city will oppress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your days: the lion, a fight-thirsty fool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fox who wears the robe of men that rule——
So run with me towards the wilderness.

## XCII

Our wilderness will be the laughing land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nuts are hung for us, where nodding peas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are wild enough to press about our knees,
And water fills the hollow of our hand.

## XCIII

My village is the loneliness, and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am as the travellers through the Syrian sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That for a moment see the warning hand
Of one who breasted up the rock, their spy.

<span id="p53"><sup><small>[ p. 53 ]</small></sup></span>

## XCIV

Where is the valiance of the folk who sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These valiant stories of the world to come?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which they describe, forsooth! as if it swum
In air and anchored with a yard of string.

## XCV

Two merchantmen decided they would battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove at last who sold the finest wares;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while Mahomet shrieked his call to prayers,
The true Messiah waved his wooden rattle.

## XCVI

Perchance the world is nothing, is a dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every noise the dreamland people say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sedulously note, and we and they
May be the shadows flung by what we seem.

## XCVII

Zohair the poet sang of loveliness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is the flight of things. Oh, meditate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the sorrows of our earthly state,
For what is lovely we may not possess.

## XCVIII

Heigho! the splendid air is full of wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they will take us to the——friend, be wise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if you navigate among the skies
You too may reach the subterranean kings.

<span id="p54"><sup><small>[ p. 54 ]</small></sup></span>

## XCIX

Now fear the rose! You travel to the gloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which the roses sing and sing so fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, but for them, you’d have a certain share
In life: your name be read upon the tomb.

## C

There is a tower of silence, and the bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves up—another man is made to be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For certain years they move in company,
But you, when fails your song do fail as well.

## CI

No sword will summon Death, and he will stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For neither helm nor shield his falling rod.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the crooked alphabet of God,
And He will read us ere he wipes away.

## CII

How strange that we, perambulating dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should be the vessels of eternal fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such unfading passion of desire
Should be within our fading bodies thrust.

## CIII

_Deep in a silent chamber of the rose_
_There was a fattened worm. He looked around,_
_Espied a relative and spoke at him:_
_It seems to me this world is very good._

<span id="p55"><sup><small>[ p. 55 ]</small></sup></span>

## CIV

_A most unlovely world, said brother worm,_
_For all of us are piteous prisoners._
_And if, declared the first, your thought is true,_
_And this a prison be, melikes it well._

## CV

_So well that I shall weave a song of praise_
_And thankfulness because the world was wrought_
_For us and with such providential care——_
_My brother, I will shame you into singing._

## CVI

_Then, cried the second, I shall raise a voice_
_And see what poor apologies are made._
_And so they sang, these two, for many days,_
_And while they sang the rose was beautiful._

## CVII

_But this affected not the songful ones,_
_And evermore in beauty lived the rose._
_And when the worms were old and wiser too,_
_They fell to silence and humility._

## CVIII

A night of silence! ’Twas the swinging sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this our world of darkness. And the twain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolled on below the stars; they flung a chain
Around the silences which are in me.

<span id="p56"><sup><small>[ p. 56 ]</small></sup></span>

## CIX

The shadows come, and they will come to bless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their brother and his dwelling and his fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I shall soil no more with any blame
Or any praise the silence I possess.
