## CHAPTER FIVE. Kalām: The Statements of the Theologians

The word usually used for scholastic theology—_kalām_\—is, like _sharī’a_, the common term for the Law, late in making its appearance. This does not mean that there was no early Islamic theology. Rather, both Law and theology were at first comprised in the term _fiqh_ (in-sight), which embraced right action and right belief. _Fiqh_ contrasted with _‘ilm_ (knowledge), which applied chiefly to the gathering of _Ḥadīth_, biography and history. When it was desirable to make a distinction between _fiqh_ as theology and _fiqh_ as law, the expressions _fiqh fi-al-dīn_ (insight in religion) and _fiqh_ _fi-al-‘ilm_ (insight in knowledge) were used. The latter term recognizes the close bond between right action—the Law—and _Ḥadīth_, the vehicle of the _sunna_.

The elaboration of theology was greatly accelerated in Islam, as in other religions, by political and social history. During the first two centuries, more than one segment of the Islamic community separated from the main body, at times taking up arms against those who differed. Thus made intensely aware of boundaries, it became necessary for Islamic thinkers to state what the boundaries were.
