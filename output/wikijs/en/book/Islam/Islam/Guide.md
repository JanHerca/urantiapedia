The system of transliteration used in this volume for rendering Arabic and Persian words in Latin letters closely follows standard modern international practise.

The sounds thus represented may be approximated as follows in standard English:

_Vowels_

_Short “a”_: between the vowel sounds of “hat” and “fur.”

_Long “a”_: (_ā_): like the a in “hard.”

_Short “i”_: as in English “pit.”

_Long “i”_ (_ī_): like the vowel sound in “feet.”

_Short “u”_: as in “hook,” or “put.”

_Long “u”_: (_û_): as in “clue,” or the vowel sound in “food.”

_Consonants_

_Glottal stop_, or hamza, _represented by_ (_’_): can be found in between two English words ending and beginning with vowels, as: “Iowa apples,” or where the “t’s” should be in “bottle,” as it is pronounced by many New Yorkers.

‘ayn, _represented by_ (_‘_): a sort of twang of the vocal cords preceding or following another letter.

(_q_), _the Arabic_ qāf: made by a “k” far back in the throat, at the uvula.

(_ḥ_), _Arabic_ ḥā’: a strongly aspirant “h”, made in the throat area above the windpipe.

(_ṡ_) (_ẓ_) (_ṭ_) (_ḍ_): each is made by darkening the sound of the corresponding undotted letter. When these dotted consonants are made, the tongue should lie flat and broad in the mouth, behind the lower front teeth. The consonant <span id="p252">[<sup><small>252</small></sup>]</span> sound will also slightly alter the quality of any vowel which immediately precedes or follows it.

(_gh_), _Arabic_ ghayn: it is made by a sort of dry gargling like the Parisian (r).

(_kh_), _Arabic_ khā’: much like German “_ch_” in “nicht” or “Nacht,” or the Greek _chi_.
