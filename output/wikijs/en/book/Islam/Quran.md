<b>THE MEANING OF THE GLORIOUS QURAN</b><br>
by Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall<br>
Hyderabad-Deccan : Government Central Press [138]
</p>

> This is M.M. Pickthall's English rendering of the Qur'an. It is technically not in the public domain in the US, because it was published in India after 1922. However, Pickthall died in 1936, so it is now in the public domain in countries with the death+50 public domain rule (e.g. Australia, Pakistan, Canada), and it is also in the public domain in countries with the death+70 rule (e.g. UK and countries in the European Union), as of the end of 2006.

The Qur'an (also known as the Koran) is the primary sacred text of Islam. Devout Muslims believe that only an Arabic version of this text is the actual Qur'an, so please be aware of this. This page links only the Pickthall English version. For other translations you can check the link below to Sacred texts website, from which this version has been obtained. 

The books of the Qur'an (or Surahs, in Arabic) are given standardized names in this hypertext, consisting of the name of the surah in Arabic and an English translation (where feasible) of the name of the Surah. The Pickthall text is more literary and certainly more readable, and is probably a better version for citation purposes.
