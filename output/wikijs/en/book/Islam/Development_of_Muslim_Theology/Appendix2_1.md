The non-Arabist will gain much insight into Muslim life and thought by reading such translations as that of Ibn Khallikan by De Slane (Paris-London; 1843-71), the Persian Tabari, by Zotenberg (Paris; 1867-74), Ibn Batuta by Defrémery and Sanguinetti (Paris; 1853-58), Mas‘udi by C. Barbier de Meynard and Pavet de Courteille (Paris; 1861-77), Ibd Khaldun's _Prolégomènes_ by De Slane (Paris; 1862-68), ad-Dimishqi by Mehren (Copenhagen; 1874), al-Beruni's _Chronology_ by Sachau (London; 1879).

The translations and notes in De Sacy's _Chrestomathie arabe_ (Paris; 1826) can also be used to advantage.

Very many valuable articles will be found scattered through the _Zeitschrift_ of the German Oriental Society (hereafter ZDMG), the _Journal asiatique_ (hereafter JA), the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_ (hereafter JRAS) and the Vienna _Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes_ (hereafter WZ).

It is always worth while to consult the _Encyclopædia Britannica_.

The best translations of the Qur’an into English are those by E. H. Palmer (2 vols., Oxford; 1880) and J. M. Rodwell (London; 1871). The first more perfectly represents the spirit and tone, and the second more exactly the letter. The commentary added by Sale to his version and his introduction are still useful.

The Thousand and One Nights should be read in its entirety in Arabic or in a translation by every student of Islam. English translation by Lane (incomplete but accurate and with very valuable commentary); Burton (last edition almost complete; 12 vols., London: 1894). Payne's translation is complete, as is also Burton's privately printed edition; but, while exceedingly readable, Payne hardly represents the tone of the original. There is an almost complete and very cheap German version by Henning published by Reclaim, Leipzig); Mardrus' French version is inaccurate and free to such an extent as to make it useless. Galland's version is a work of genius; but it belongs to French and not to Arabic literature.

R. P. A. Dozy: _Essai sur l’histoire de l’islamisme_. Leyden, 1879. A readable introduction.

A. MÜLLER: _Der Islam im Morgen-und-Abendland_. 2 vols. Berlin, 1885, 1887. The best general history of Islam.

STANLEY LANE-POOLE: _The Mohammedan Dynasties; chronological and genealogical tables with historical introductions_. Westminster, 1894. An indispensable book for any student of Muslim history.

C. BROCKELMANN: _Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur_. 2 vols. Weimar, 1898, 1899. Indispensable for names, dates, and books, but not a history in any true sense.

T. B. HUGHES: _A Dictionary of Islam_. London, 1896. Very full of information, but to be used with caution. Based on Persian sources largely.

E. W. LANE: _An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians_. First edition, London, 1836; third, 1842. Many others. Indispensable.

<span id="p360">[<sup><small>p. 360</small></sup>]</span>

C. M. DOUGHTY. _Travels in Arabia Deserta_ 2 vols. Cambridge, 1888. By far the best book on nomad life in Arabia. Gives the fullest and clearest idea of the nature and workings of the Arab mind.

J. L. BURCKHARDT: _Notes on the Bedouins and Wahabys_. 2 vols. London, 1831.

T L. BURCKHARDT: _Travels in Arabia_. 2 vols. London, 1829.

R. F. BURTON: _Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to al-Madinah and Meccah_. 2 vols. Last edition, London, 1898. On the Hajj and Muslim life, thought and studies generally in the middle of the nineteenth century. Readable and accurate to a degree.

C. SNOUCK HURGRONJE: _Mekka_. 2 vols. and portfolio of plates. Haag, 1888, 1889. Is somewhat dull beside Burton, but very full and accurate.

W. ROBERTSON SMITH _Lectures on the Religion of the Semites_. First Series. New edition, London, 1894. Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia. Cambridge, 1885.

IGNAZ GOLDZIHER: _Muhammedanische Studien_. I, Halle a. S., 1889. II, 1890. Epoch-marking books; as are all Goldziher's contributions to the history of Muslim civilization.

ALFRED VON KREMER _Geschichte der herrschenden Ideen des Islams_. Leipzig, 1868.

ALFRED VON KREMER _Culturgeschichte des Orients enter den Chalifen_. 2 vols. Wien, 1875-77. _Culturgeschichtliche Streifzüge_. Leipzig, 1873.

EDWARD G. BROWNE: _A Year Among the Persians_. London, 1893. A most valuable account of modern Persian life, philosophy, and theology, and especially of Sufiism and Babism.

EDWARD G. BROWNE: _A Literary History of Persia_. New York, 1902. Really political and religious prolegomena to such a history.

G. A. HERKLOTS: _Qanoon-e-Islam_, or the Customs of the Moosulmans of India. London, 1832.
