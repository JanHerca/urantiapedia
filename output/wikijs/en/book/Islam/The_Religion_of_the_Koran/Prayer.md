CHAPTER II., Verse 182.—When my servants ask thee concerning me, then, verily, I am near; I answer the prayer's prayer whene'er he prays to Me. So let them ask Me for an answer, and let them believe in me; haply they may be directed aright.

Chapter IV., Verse 104.—But when ye have fulfilled your prayer, remember God standing and sitting and lying on your sides; and when ye are in safety then be steadfast in prayer; verily, prayer is for the believers prescribed and timed!
