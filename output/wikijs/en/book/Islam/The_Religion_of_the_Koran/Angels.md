CHAPTER III., Verse 16.—God bears witness that there is no God but He, and the angels, and those possessed of knowledge standing up for justice. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Wise…

Verse 120.—When thou didst say unto the believers, “Is it not enough for you that your Lord assists you, with three thousand of the angels sent down from on high?”

Chapter VI., Verse 61.—He triumphs over his servants; He sends to them guardian angels, until, when death comes to any one of you, our messengers take him away; they pass not over any one, and then are they returned to God, their true sovereign.

Chapter VIII., Verse 12.—When your Lord inspired the angels—“Verily, I am with you; make ye firm then those who believe; I will cast dread into the hearts of those who misbelieve—strike off their necks then, and strike off from them every finger-tip.”

That is, because they went into opposition against God and His apostle; for he who goes into opposition against God and His apostle—verily, God is keen to punish.

Chapter XVI., Verse 3.—He sends down the angels with the Spirit at His bidding upon whom He will of His servants (to say), “Give warning that there is no God but Me.”

Chapter XXXV., Verse 1.—In the name of the Merciful and Compassionate God.

Praise belongs to God, the originator of the heavens and the earth; who makes the angels His messengers, endued with wings in pairs, or threes, or fours; He adds to creation what He pleases; verily, God is mighty over all!

Chapter XXXIX., Verse 75.—And thou shalt see the angels circling round about the throne, celebrating the praise of their Lord; and it shall be decided between them in truth; and it shall be said, “Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!”

Chapter XLII., Verse 3.—And the angels celebrate the praises of their Lord, and ask forgiveness for those who are on the earth.

Chapter L., Verse 16.—When the two meeters meet, sitting the one on the right and the other on the left, not a word does he utter, but a watcher is by him ready!
