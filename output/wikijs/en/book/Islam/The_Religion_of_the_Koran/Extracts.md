CHAPTER II., Verse 1.—In the name of the Merciful and Compassionate God

That is the Book! there is no doubt therein; a guide to the pious, who believe in the unseen, and are steadfast in prayer, and of what we have given them expend in alms; who believe in what is revealed to thee, and what was revealed before thee, and of the hereafter they are sure. These are in guidance from their Lord, and these are the prosperous.

Chapter VI., Verse 109.—They swore by God with their most strenuous oath, that if there come to them a sign they will indeed believe therein. Say, “Signs are only in God's hands: but what will make you understand that, even when one has come, they will not believe?”

(110).—We will overturn their hearts and their eyesights, even as they believed not at first; and we will leave them, in their rebellion, blindly wandering on.

And had we sent down unto them the angels, or <span id="p28">[<sup><small>p. 28</small></sup>]</span> the dead had spoken to them, or we had gathered everything unto them in hosts, they would not have believed unless that God pleased—but most of them are ignorant.

So have we made for every prophet an enemy, devils of men and jinns; some of them inspire others with specious speech to lead astray; but had thy Lord pleased they would not have done it; so leave them with what they do devise.

And let the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter listen to it; and let them be well pleased with it; and let them gain what they may gain!

Of other than God shall I crave a decree, when it is He who has sent down to you the Book in detail, and those to whom we gave the Book know that it is sent down from thy Lord in truth? be thou not then of those who doubt.

(115).—The words of thy Lord are fulfilled in truth and justice; there is none to change His words, for He both hears and knows.

Chapter VII., Verse 201.—Shouldst thou not bring them a sign, they say, “Hast thou not yet made choice of one?” Say, “I only follow what is inspired to me by my Lord. These are perceptions from my Lord, and a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe.”

And when the Koran is read, then listen thereto and keep silence; haply ye may obtain mercy.

Chapter X., Verse 38.—This Koran could not have been devised by any beside God; but it verifies that which was before it, and details the Book—there is no doubt therein—from the Lord of the worlds.

<span id="p29">[<sup><small>p. 29</small></sup>]</span>

Do they say, “He hath devised it? ”Say then, “Bring a verse like it,—and call, if ye can, on other than God, if ye do tell the truth!”

Chapter XVII., Verse 90.—Say, “If mankind and jinns united together to bring the like of this Koran, they could not bring the like, though they should back each other up!”

We have turned about for men in this Koran every parable, but most men refuse to accept it, save ungratefully.

And they say, “We will by no means believe in thee, until there gush forth for thee a fountain from the earth; or there be made for thee a garden of palms and grapes, and rivers come gushing out amidst them; or thou make the sky to fall down upon us in pieces; or thou bring us God and the angels before us; (95) or there be made for thee a house of gold; or thou climb up into the heaven; and even then we will not believe in thy climbing there, until thou send down on us a book that we may read!”

Chapter XLI., Verse 1.—In the name of the Merciful and Compassionate God.

A revelation from the Merciful, the Compassionate; a book whose signs are detailed; an Arabic Koran for a people who do know; a herald of glad tidings and a warning.

Chapter LIII., Verse 1.—In the name of the Merciful and Compassionate God.

By the star when it falls, your comrade errs not, nor is he deluded! nor speaks he out of lust! It is but an inspiration inspired! (5) One mighty in power taught him, endowed with sound understanding, and appeared, he being in the loftiest tract.
