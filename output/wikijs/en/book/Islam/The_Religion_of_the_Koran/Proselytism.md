CHAPTER II., Verse 189.—But fight them that there be no sedition, and that the religion may be God's; but if they desist, then let there be no hostility save against the unjust.

Chapter III., Verse 163.—Count not those who are killed in the way of God as dead, but living with their Lord; provided for, rejoicing in what God has brought them of His grace, and being glad for those who have not reached them yet—those left behind them; there is no fear for them, and they shall not be grieved, (165) glad at favour from God and grace, and that God wasteth not the hire of the believers.

Chapter XLVIII., Verse 16.—“Ye shall be called out against a people endowed with vehement valour, and shall fight them or they shall become Muslims. And if ye obey, God will give you a good hire; but if ye turn your backs, as ye turned your backs before, He will torment you with grievous woe!”
