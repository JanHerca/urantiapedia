<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Nun. By the pen and that which they write (therewith),
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto thee, a madman.
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing.
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  And thou wilt see and they will see
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Which of you is the demented.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is Best Aware of those who walk aright.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Therefor obey not thou the rejecters
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders,
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  Greedy therewithal, intrusive.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  It is because he is possessed of wealth and children
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the men of old.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  We shall brand him on the nose.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Lo! We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning,
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  And made no exception (for the Will of Allah);
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Then a visitation from thy Lord came upon it while they slept
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And in the morning it was as if plucked.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  And they cried out one unto another in the morning,
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit).
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  So they went off, saying one unto another in low tones:
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  No needy man shall enter it to-day against you.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  They went betimes, strong in (this) purpose.
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error!
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  Nay, but we are desolate!
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah) ?
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching.
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous.
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we beseech our Lord.
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they did but know.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord.
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty ?
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  What aileth you ? How foolishly ye judge!
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose ?
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment, that yours shall be all that ye ordain ?
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will vouch for that!
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  Or have they other gods ? Then let them bring their other gods if they are truthful
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate themselves but are not able,
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt.
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not.
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm.
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed ?
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof) ?
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried out in despair.
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate.
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad;
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation.
