<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By those who drag forth to destruction,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  By the meteors rushing,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  By the lone stars floating,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  By the angels hastening,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  And those who govern the event,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  On the day when the first trump resoundeth.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  And the second followeth it,
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  On that day hearts beat painfully
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  While eyes are downcast
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  (Now) they are saying: Shall we really be restored to our first state
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Even after we are crumbled bones ?
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  They say: Then that would be a vain proceeding.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  Surely it will need but one shout,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And lo! they will be awakened.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Hath there come unto thee the history of Moses ?
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  How his Lord called him in the holy vale of Tuwa,
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  (Saying:) Go thou unto Pharaoh - Lo! he hath rebelled -
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  And say (unto him): Hast thou (will) to grow (in grace) ?
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Then I will guide thee to thy Lord and thou shalt fear (Him).
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And he showed him the tremendous token.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  But he denied and disobeyed,
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  Then turned he away in haste,
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Then gathered he and summoned
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  And proclaimed: “I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest.”
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  So Allah seized him (and made him) an example for the after (life) and for the former.
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for him who feareth.
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  Are ye the harder to create, or is the heaven that He built ?
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  He raised the height thereof and ordered it;
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  And He made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morn thereof.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  And after that He spread the earth,
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  And produced therefrom the water thereof and the pasture thereof,
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  And He made fast the hills,
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  A provision for you and for your cattle.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  But when the great disaster cometh,
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  The day when man will call to mind his (whole) endeavour,
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  And hell will stand forth visible to him who seeth,
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Then, as for him who rebelled
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  And chose the life of the world,
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  Lo! hell will be his home.
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  But as for him who feared to stand before his Lord and restrained his soul from lust,
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  Lo! the Garden will be his home.
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  They ask thee of the Hour: when will it come to port ?
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  Why (ask they) ? What hast thou to tell thereof ?
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Unto thy Lord belongeth (knowledge of) the term thereof.
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  Thou art but a warner unto him who feareth it.
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  On the day when they behold it, it will be as if they had but tarried for an evening or the morn thereof.
