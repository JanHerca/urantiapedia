<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Whereof do they question one another ?
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  (It is) of the awful tidings,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Concerning which they are in disagreement.
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Nay, but they will come to know!
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Nay, again, but they will come to know!
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Have We not made the earth an expanse,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  And the high hills bulwarks ?
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  And We have created you in pairs,
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And have appointed your sleep for repose,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And have appointed the night as a cloak,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  And have appointed the day for livelihood.
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  And We have built above you seven strong (heavens),
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And have appointed a dazzling lamp,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant water,
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Thereby to produce grain and plant,
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  And gardens of thick foliage.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Lo! the Day of Decision is a fixed time,
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  A day when the trumpet is blown and ye come in multitudes,
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  And the heaven is opened and becometh as gates,
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And the hills are set in motion and become as a mirage.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Lo! hell lurketh in ambush,
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  A home for the rebellious.
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  They will abide therein for ages.
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  Therein taste they neither coolness nor (any) drink
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Save boiling water and a paralysing cold:
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Reward proportioned (to their evil deeds).
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  For lo! they looked not for a reckoning;
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  They called Our revelations false with strong denial.
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  Everything have We recorded in a Book.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  So taste (of that which ye have earned). No increase do We give you save of torment.
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  Lo! for the duteous is achievement -
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  Gardens enclosed and vineyards,
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  And maidens for companions,
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  And a full cup.
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  There hear they never vain discourse, nor lying -
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  Requital from thy Lord - a gift in payment -
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Lord of the heavens and the earth, and (all) that is between them, the Beneficent; with Whom none can converse.
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  On the day when the angels and the Spirit stand arrayed, they speak not, saving him whom the Beneficent alloweth and who speaketh right.
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  That is the True Day. So whoso will should seek recourse unto his Lord.
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  Lo! We warn you of a doom at hand, a day whereon a man will look on that which his own hands have sent before, and the disbeliever will cry: “Would that I were dust!”
