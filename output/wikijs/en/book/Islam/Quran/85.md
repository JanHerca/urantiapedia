<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By the heaven, holding mansions of the stars,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And by the Promised Day.
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And by the witness and that whereunto he beareth testimony,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  (Self-)destroyed were the owners of the ditch
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Of the fuel-fed fire,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  When they sat by it,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  And were themselves the witnesses of what they did to the believers.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  They had naught against them save that they believed in Allah, the Mighty, the Owner of Praise,
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is of all things the Witness.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Lo! they who persecute believing men and believing women and repent not, theirs verily will be the doom of hell, and theirs the doom of burning.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs will be Gardens underneath which rivers flow. That is the Great Success.
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Lo! the punishment of thy Lord is stern.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  Lo! He it is Who produceth, then reproduceth,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And He is the Forgiving, the Loving,
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Lord of the Throne of Glory,
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Doer of what He will.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Hath there come unto thee the story of the hosts
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Of Pharaoh and (the tribe of) Thamud ?
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Nay, but those who disbelieve live in denial
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And Allah, all unseen, surroundeth them.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Nay, but it is a glorious Qur'an.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  On a guarded tablet.
