<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By those that winnow with a winnowing
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And those that bear the burden (of the rain)
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And those that glide with ease (upon the sea)
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And those who distribute (blessings) by command,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Lo! that wherewith ye are threatened is indeed true,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  And lo! the judgment will indeed befall.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  By the heaven full of paths,
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Lo! ye, forsooth, are of various opinion (concerning the truth).
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  He is made to turn away from it who is (himself) averse.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Accursed be the conjecturers
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Who are careless in an abyss!
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  They ask: When is the Day of Judgment ?
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  (It is) the day when they will be tormented at the Fire,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  (And it will be said unto them): Taste your torment (which ye inflicted). This is what ye sought to hasten.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Lo! those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and watersprings,
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Taking that which their Lord giveth them; for lo! aforetime they were doers of good;
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  They used to sleep but little of the night,
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  And ere the dawning of each day would seek forgiveness,
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  And in their wealth the beggar and the outcast had due share.
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  And (also) in yourselves. Can ye then not see ?
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  And in the heaven is your providence and that which ye are promised;
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it is the truth, even as (it is true) that ye speak.
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  Hath the story of Abraham's honoured guests reached thee (O Muhammad) ?
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  When they came in unto him and said: Peace! he answered, Peace! (and thought): Folk unknown (to me).
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Then he went apart unto his housefolk so that they brought a fatted calf;
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And he set it before them, saying: Will ye not eat ?
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  Then he conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! and gave him tidings of (the birth of) a wise son.
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  Then his wife came forward, making moan, and smote her face, and cried: A barren old woman!
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  They said: Even so saith thy Lord. Lo! He is the Wise, the Knower.
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  (Abraham) said: And (afterward) what is your errand, O ye sent (from Allah) ?
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  They said: Lo! we are sent unto a guilty folk,
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  That we may send upon them stones of clay,
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  Marked by thy Lord for (the destruction of) the wanton.
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  Then we brought forth such believers as were there.
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  But We found there but one house of those surrendered (to Allah).
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  And We left behind therein a portent for those who fear a painful doom.
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  And in Moses (too, there is a portent) when We sent him unto Pharaoh with clear warrant,
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  But he withdrew (confiding) in his might, and said: A wizard or a madman.
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  So We seized him and his hosts and flung them in the sea, for he was reprobate.
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  And in (the tribe of) A'ad (there is a portent) when we sent the fatal wind against them.
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  It spared naught that it reached, but made it (all) as dust.
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  And in (the tribe of) Thamud (there is a portent) when it was told them: Take your ease awhile.
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  But they rebelled against their Lord's decree, and so the thunderbolt overtook them even while they gazed;
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  And they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves.
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  And the folk of Noah aforetime. Lo! they were licentious folk.
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof).
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  And the earth have We laid out, how gracious is the Spreader (thereof)!
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  And all things We have created by pairs, that haply ye may reflect.
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  Therefor flee unto Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from him.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  And set not any other god along with Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from Him.
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  Even so there came no messenger unto those before them but they said: A wizard or a madman!
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  Have they handed down (the saying) as an heirloom one unto another ? Nay, but they are froward folk.
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), for thou art in no wise blameworthy,
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  And warn, for warning profiteth believers.
<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me.
<span id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup></span>  I seek no livelihood from them, nor do I ask that they should feed Me.
<span id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup></span>  Lo! Allah! He it is that giveth livelihood, the Lord of unbreakable might.
<span id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup></span>  And lo! for those who (now) do wrong there is an evil day like unto the evil day (which came for) their likes (of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on (that day).
<span id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup></span>  And woe unto those who disbelieve, from (that) their day which they are promised.
