<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Ta. Sin. Mim.
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain.
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe not.
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but they turn away from it.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein ?
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil) ?
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me,
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor send for Aaron (to help me).
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds,
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  (Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us.
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  (Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child ? And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us,
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates.
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him).
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel.
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ?
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  (Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  (Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ?
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers.
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  (Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman!
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did but understand.
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  (Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  He said: Even though I show thee something plain ?
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  (Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful!
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest,
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  (Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing wizard,
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye ?
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities summoners
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard.
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed.
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ?
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  (They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners.
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners ?
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me).
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw!
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's might, lo! we verily are the winners.
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely show.
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  And the wizards were flung prostrate,
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  The Lord of Moses and Aaron.
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  (Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you every one.
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers.
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued.
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners,
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  (Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop,
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  And lo! they are offenders against us.
<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  And lo! we are a ready host.
<span id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup></span>  Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings,
<span id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup></span>  And treasures and a fair estate.
<span id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup></span>  Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.
<span id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup></span>  And they overtook them at sunrise.
<span id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup></span>  And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are indeed caught.
<span id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup></span>  He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me.
<span id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup></span>  Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted, and each part was as a mountain vast.
<span id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup></span>  Then brought We near the others to that place.
<span id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup></span>  And We saved Moses and those with him, every one;
<span id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup></span>  And We drowned the others.
<span id="v67"><sup><small>67</small></sup></span>  Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
<span id="v68"><sup><small>68</small></sup></span>  And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v69"><sup><small>69</small></sup></span>  Recite unto them the story of Abraham:
<span id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup></span>  When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye ?
<span id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup></span>  They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them.
<span id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup></span>  He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ?
<span id="v73"><sup><small>73</small></sup></span>  Or do they benefit or harm you ?
<span id="v74"><sup><small>74</small></sup></span>  They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise.
<span id="v75"><sup><small>75</small></sup></span>  He said: See now that which ye worship,
<span id="v76"><sup><small>76</small></sup></span>  Ye and your forefathers!
<span id="v77"><sup><small>77</small></sup></span>  Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds,
<span id="v78"><sup><small>78</small></sup></span>  Who created me, and He doth guide me,
<span id="v79"><sup><small>79</small></sup></span>  And Who feedeth me and watereth me.
<span id="v80"><sup><small>80</small></sup></span>  And when I sicken, then He healeth me,
<span id="v81"><sup><small>81</small></sup></span>  And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again),
<span id="v82"><sup><small>82</small></sup></span>  And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment.
<span id="v83"><sup><small>83</small></sup></span>  My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous.
<span id="v84"><sup><small>84</small></sup></span>  And give unto me a good report in later generations.
<span id="v85"><sup><small>85</small></sup></span>  And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight,
<span id="v86"><sup><small>86</small></sup></span>  And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err.
<span id="v87"><sup><small>87</small></sup></span>  And abase me not on the day when they are raised,
<span id="v88"><sup><small>88</small></sup></span>  The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man)
<span id="v89"><sup><small>89</small></sup></span>  Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart.
<span id="v90"><sup><small>90</small></sup></span>  And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil).
<span id="v91"><sup><small>91</small></sup></span>  And hell will appear plainly to the erring.
<span id="v92"><sup><small>92</small></sup></span>  And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship
<span id="v93"><sup><small>93</small></sup></span>  Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or help themselves ?
<span id="v94"><sup><small>94</small></sup></span>  Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers
<span id="v95"><sup><small>95</small></sup></span>  And the hosts of Iblis, together.
<span id="v96"><sup><small>96</small></sup></span>  And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein:
<span id="v97"><sup><small>97</small></sup></span>  By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest
<span id="v98"><sup><small>98</small></sup></span>  When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds.
<span id="v99"><sup><small>99</small></sup></span>  It was but the guilty who misled us.
<span id="v100"><sup><small>100</small></sup></span>  Now we have no intercessors
<span id="v101"><sup><small>101</small></sup></span>  Nor any loving friend.
<span id="v102"><sup><small>102</small></sup></span>  Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers!
<span id="v103"><sup><small>103</small></sup></span>  Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers!
<span id="v104"><sup><small>104</small></sup></span>  And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v105"><sup><small>105</small></sup></span>  Noah's folk denied the messengers (of Allah),
<span id="v106"><sup><small>106</small></sup></span>  When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
<span id="v107"><sup><small>107</small></sup></span>  Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
<span id="v108"><sup><small>108</small></sup></span>  So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.
<span id="v109"><sup><small>109</small></sup></span>  And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
<span id="v110"><sup><small>110</small></sup></span>  So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.
<span id="v111"><sup><small>111</small></sup></span>  They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow thee ?
<span id="v112"><sup><small>112</small></sup></span>  He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in the past) ?
<span id="v113"><sup><small>113</small></sup></span>  Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew;
<span id="v114"><sup><small>114</small></sup></span>  And I am not (here) to repulse believers.
<span id="v115"><sup><small>115</small></sup></span>  I am only a plain warner.
<span id="v116"><sup><small>116</small></sup></span>  They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned (to death).
<span id="v117"><sup><small>117</small></sup></span>  He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me.
<span id="v118"><sup><small>118</small></sup></span>  Therefor judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and those believers who are with me.
<span id="v119"><sup><small>119</small></sup></span>  And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.
<span id="v120"><sup><small>120</small></sup></span>  Then afterward We drowned the others.
<span id="v121"><sup><small>121</small></sup></span>  Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
<span id="v122"><sup><small>122</small></sup></span>  And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v123"><sup><small>123</small></sup></span>  (The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of Allah).
<span id="v124"><sup><small>124</small></sup></span>  When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
<span id="v125"><sup><small>125</small></sup></span>  Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
<span id="v126"><sup><small>126</small></sup></span>  So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
<span id="v127"><sup><small>127</small></sup></span>  And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
<span id="v128"><sup><small>128</small></sup></span>  Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight ?
<span id="v129"><sup><small>129</small></sup></span>  And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever ?
<span id="v130"><sup><small>130</small></sup></span>  And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants ?
<span id="v131"><sup><small>131</small></sup></span>  Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.
<span id="v132"><sup><small>132</small></sup></span>  Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that ye know,
<span id="v133"><sup><small>133</small></sup></span>  Hath aided you with cattle and sons.
<span id="v134"><sup><small>134</small></sup></span>  And gardens and watersprings.
<span id="v135"><sup><small>135</small></sup></span>  Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day.
<span id="v136"><sup><small>136</small></sup></span>  They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who preach;
<span id="v137"><sup><small>137</small></sup></span>  This is but a fable of the men of old,
<span id="v138"><sup><small>138</small></sup></span>  And we shall not be doomed.
<span id="v139"><sup><small>139</small></sup></span>  And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
<span id="v140"><sup><small>140</small></sup></span>  And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v141"><sup><small>141</small></sup></span>  (The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of Allah)
<span id="v142"><sup><small>142</small></sup></span>  When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
<span id="v143"><sup><small>143</small></sup></span>  Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
<span id="v144"><sup><small>144</small></sup></span>  So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
<span id="v145"><sup><small>145</small></sup></span>  And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
<span id="v146"><sup><small>146</small></sup></span>  Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us,
<span id="v147"><sup><small>147</small></sup></span>  In gardens and watersprings.
<span id="v148"><sup><small>148</small></sup></span>  And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees,
<span id="v149"><sup><small>149</small></sup></span>  Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful ?
<span id="v150"><sup><small>150</small></sup></span>  Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me,
<span id="v151"><sup><small>151</small></sup></span>  And obey not the command of the prodigal,
<span id="v152"><sup><small>152</small></sup></span>  Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not.
<span id="v153"><sup><small>153</small></sup></span>  They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched;
<span id="v154"><sup><small>154</small></sup></span>  Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful.
<span id="v155"><sup><small>155</small></sup></span>  He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well), and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day.
<span id="v156"><sup><small>156</small></sup></span>  And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful day.
<span id="v157"><sup><small>157</small></sup></span>  But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent.
<span id="v158"><sup><small>158</small></sup></span>  So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
<span id="v159"><sup><small>159</small></sup></span>  And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v160"><sup><small>160</small></sup></span>  The folk of Lot denied the messengers (of Allah),
<span id="v161"><sup><small>161</small></sup></span>  When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
<span id="v162"><sup><small>162</small></sup></span>  Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
<span id="v163"><sup><small>163</small></sup></span>  So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
<span id="v164"><sup><small>164</small></sup></span>  And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
<span id="v165"><sup><small>165</small></sup></span>  What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males,
<span id="v166"><sup><small>166</small></sup></span>  And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay, but ye are froward folk.
<span id="v167"><sup><small>167</small></sup></span>  They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast.
<span id="v168"><sup><small>168</small></sup></span>  He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct.
<span id="v169"><sup><small>169</small></sup></span>  My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do.
<span id="v170"><sup><small>170</small></sup></span>  So We saved him and his household, every one,
<span id="v171"><sup><small>171</small></sup></span>  Save an old woman among those who stayed behind.
<span id="v172"><sup><small>172</small></sup></span>  Then afterward We destroyed the others.
<span id="v173"><sup><small>173</small></sup></span>  And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned.
<span id="v174"><sup><small>174</small></sup></span>  Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
<span id="v175"><sup><small>175</small></sup></span>  And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v176"><sup><small>176</small></sup></span>  The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of Allah),
<span id="v177"><sup><small>177</small></sup></span>  When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
<span id="v178"><sup><small>178</small></sup></span>  Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
<span id="v179"><sup><small>179</small></sup></span>  So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
<span id="v180"><sup><small>180</small></sup></span>  And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
<span id="v181"><sup><small>181</small></sup></span>  Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due).
<span id="v182"><sup><small>182</small></sup></span>  And weigh with the true balance.
<span id="v183"><sup><small>183</small></sup></span>  Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the earth.
<span id="v184"><sup><small>184</small></sup></span>  And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old.
<span id="v185"><sup><small>185</small></sup></span>  They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched;
<span id="v186"><sup><small>186</small></sup></span>  Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars.
<span id="v187"><sup><small>187</small></sup></span>  Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful.
<span id="v188"><sup><small>188</small></sup></span>  He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do.
<span id="v189"><sup><small>189</small></sup></span>  But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day.
<span id="v190"><sup><small>190</small></sup></span>  Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers.
<span id="v191"><sup><small>191</small></sup></span>  And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v192"><sup><small>192</small></sup></span>  And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds,
<span id="v193"><sup><small>193</small></sup></span>  Which the True Spirit hath brought down
<span id="v194"><sup><small>194</small></sup></span>  Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners,
<span id="v195"><sup><small>195</small></sup></span>  In plain Arabic speech.
<span id="v196"><sup><small>196</small></sup></span>  And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old.
<span id="v197"><sup><small>197</small></sup></span>  Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it ?
<span id="v198"><sup><small>198</small></sup></span>  And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs,
<span id="v199"><sup><small>199</small></sup></span>  And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it.
<span id="v200"><sup><small>200</small></sup></span>  Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty.
<span id="v201"><sup><small>201</small></sup></span>  They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom,
<span id="v202"><sup><small>202</small></sup></span>  So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not.
<span id="v203"><sup><small>203</small></sup></span>  Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved ?
<span id="v204"><sup><small>204</small></sup></span>  Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ?
<span id="v205"><sup><small>205</small></sup></span>  Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years,
<span id="v206"><sup><small>206</small></sup></span>  And then cometh that which they were promised,
<span id="v207"><sup><small>207</small></sup></span>  (How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them ?
<span id="v208"><sup><small>208</small></sup></span>  And We destroyed no township but it had its warners
<span id="v209"><sup><small>209</small></sup></span>  For reminder, for We never were oppressors.
<span id="v210"><sup><small>210</small></sup></span>  The devils did not bring it down.
<span id="v211"><sup><small>211</small></sup></span>  It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power,
<span id="v212"><sup><small>212</small></sup></span>  Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing.
<span id="v213"><sup><small>213</small></sup></span>  Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed.
<span id="v214"><sup><small>214</small></sup></span>  And warn thy tribe of near kindred,
<span id="v215"><sup><small>215</small></sup></span>  And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee.
<span id="v216"><sup><small>216</small></sup></span>  And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they do.
<span id="v217"><sup><small>217</small></sup></span>  And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v218"><sup><small>218</small></sup></span>  Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray)
<span id="v219"><sup><small>219</small></sup></span>  And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship).
<span id="v220"><sup><small>220</small></sup></span>  Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower.
<span id="v221"><sup><small>221</small></sup></span>  Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend ?
<span id="v222"><sup><small>222</small></sup></span>  They descend on every sinful, false one.
<span id="v223"><sup><small>223</small></sup></span>  They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars.
<span id="v224"><sup><small>224</small></sup></span>  As for poets, the erring follow them.
<span id="v225"><sup><small>225</small></sup></span>  Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley,
<span id="v226"><sup><small>226</small></sup></span>  And how they say that which they do not ?
<span id="v227"><sup><small>227</small></sup></span>  Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned!
