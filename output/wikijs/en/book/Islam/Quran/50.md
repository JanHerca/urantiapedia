<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Nay, but they marvel that a warner of their own hath come unto them; and the disbelievers say: This is a strange thing:
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be brought back again) ? That would be a far return!
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  We know that which the earth taketh of them, and with Us is a recording Book.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Nay, but they have denied the truth when it came unto them, therefor they are now in troubled case.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Have they not then observed the sky above them, how We have constructed it and beautified it, and how there are no rifts therein ?
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  And the earth have We spread out, and have flung firm hills therein, and have caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon,
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  A vision and a reminder for every penitent slave.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And We send down from the sky blessed water whereby We give growth unto gardens and the grain of crops,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And lofty date-palms with ranged clusters,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Provision (made) for men; and therewith We quicken a dead land. Even so will be the resurrection of the dead.
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  The folk of Noah denied (the truth) before them, and (so did) the dwellers at Ar-Rass and (the tribe of) Thamud,
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And (the tribe of) A'ad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And the dwellers in the wood, and the folk of Tubb'a: every one denied their messengers, therefor My threat took effect.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Were We then worn out by the first creation ? Yet they are in doubt about a new creation.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him, and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  When the two Receivers receive (him), seated on the right hand and on the left,
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  He uttereth no word but there is with him an observer ready.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  And the agony of death cometh in truth. (And it is said unto him): This is that which thou wast wont to shun.
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And the trumpet is blown. This is the threatened Day.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  And every soul cometh, along with it a driver and a witness.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  (And unto the evil-doer it is said): Thou wast in heedlessness of this. Now We have removed from thee thy covering, and piercing is thy sight this day.
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  And (unto the evil-doer) his comrade saith: This is that which I have ready (as testimony).
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  (And it is said): Do ye twain hurl to hell each rebel ingrate,
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter,
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Who setteth up another god along with Allah. Do ye twain hurl him to the dreadful doom.
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  His comrade saith: Our Lord! I did not cause him to rebel, but he was (himself) far gone in error.
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  He saith: Contend not in My presence, when I had already proffered unto you the warning.
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  The sentence that cometh from Me cannot be changed, and I am in no wise a tyrant unto the slaves.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  On the day when We say unto hell: Art thou filled ? and it saith: Can there be more to come ?
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  And the Garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil, no longer distant.
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  (And it is said): This is that which ye were promised. (It is) for every penitent and heedful one,
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  Who feareth the Beneficent in secret and cometh with a contrite heart.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  Enter it in peace. This is the day of immortality.
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  There they have all that they desire, and there is more with Us.
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  And how many a generation We destroyed before them, who were mightier than these in prowess so that they overran the lands! Had they any place of refuge (when the judgment came) ?
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Lo! therein verily is a reminder for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear with full intelligence.
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six Days, and naught of weariness touched Us.
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  Therefor (O Muhammad) bear with what they say, and hymn the praise of thy Lord before the rising and before the setting of the sun;
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  And in the night-time hymn His praise, and after the (prescribed) prostrations.
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  And listen on the day when the crier crieth from a near place,
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  The day when they will hear the (Awful) Cry in truth. That is the day of coming forth (from the graves).
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  Lo! We it is Who quicken and give death, and unto Us is the journeying.
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  On the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them, hastening forth (they come). That is a gathering easy for Us (to make).
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  We are Best Aware of what they say, and thou (O Muhammad) art in no wise a compeller over them. But warn by the Qur'an him who feareth My threat.
