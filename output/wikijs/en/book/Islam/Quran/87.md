<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Praise the name of thy Lord the Most High,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Who createth, then disposeth;
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Who measureth, then guideth;
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Who bringeth forth the pasturage,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Then turneth it to russet stubble.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  We shall make thee read (O Muhammad) so that thou shalt not forget
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Save that which Allah willeth. Lo! He knoweth the disclosed and that which still is hidden;
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  And We shall ease thy way unto the state of ease.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Therefor remind (men), for of use is the reminder.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  He will heed who feareth,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  But the most hapless will flout it,
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  He who will be flung to the great Fire
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  Wherein he will neither die nor live.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  He is successful who groweth,
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  And remembereth the name of his Lord, so prayeth,
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  But ye prefer the life of the world
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Lo! This is in the former scrolls.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  The Books of Abraham and Moses.
