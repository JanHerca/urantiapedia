<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  When the event befalleth -
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  There is no denying that it will befall -
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Abasing (some), exalting (others);
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  When the earth is shaken with a shock
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  And the hills are ground to powder
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  So that they become a scattered dust,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  And ye will be three kinds:
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  (First) those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand ?
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And (then) those on the left hand; what of those on the left hand ?
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And the foremost in the race, the foremost in the race:
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Those are they who will be brought nigh
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  In gardens of delight;
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  A multitude of those of old
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And a few of those of later time.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  On lined couches,
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Reclining therein face to face.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  There wait on them immortal youths
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  With bowls and ewers and a cup from a pure spring
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Wherefrom they get no aching of the head nor any madness,
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And fruit that they prefer
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  And flesh of fowls that they desire.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  And (there are) fair ones with wide, lovely eyes,
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Like unto hidden pearls,
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  Reward for what they used to do.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  There hear they no vain speaking nor recrimination
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  (Naught) but the saying: Peace, (and again) Peace.
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand ?
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  Among thornless lote-trees
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  And clustered plantains,
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  And spreading shade,
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  And water gushing,
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  And fruit in plenty
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  Neither out of reach nor yet forbidden,
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  And raised couches;
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  Lo! We have created them a (new) creation
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  And made them virgins,
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Lovers, friends,
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  For those on the right hand;
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  A multitude of those of old
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  And a multitude of those of later time.
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  And those on the left hand: What of those on the left hand ?
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  In scorching wind and scalding water
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  And shadow of black smoke,
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Neither cool nor refreshing.
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  Lo! heretofore they were effete with luxury
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  And used to persist in the awful sin.
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  And they used to say: When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again,
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  And also our forefathers ?
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! those of old and those of later time
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  Will all be brought together to the tryst of an appointed day.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  Then lo! ye, the erring, the deniers,
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  Ye verily will eat of a tree called Zaqqum
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  And will fill your bellies therewith;
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  And thereon ye will drink of boiling water,
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  Drinking even as the camel drinketh.
<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  This will be their welcome on the Day of Judgment.
<span id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup></span>  We created you. Will ye then admit the truth ?
<span id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup></span>  Have ye seen that which ye emit ?
<span id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup></span>  Do ye create it or are We the Creator ?
<span id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup></span>  We mete out death among you, and We are not to be outrun,
<span id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup></span>  That We may transfigure you and make you what ye know not.
<span id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup></span>  And verily ye know the first creation. Why, then, do ye not reflect ?
<span id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup></span>  Have ye seen that which ye cultivate ?
<span id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup></span>  Is it ye who foster it, or are We the Fosterer ?
<span id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup></span>  If We willed, We verily could make it chaff, then would ye cease not to exclaim:
<span id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup></span>  Lo! we are laden with debt!
<span id="v67"><sup><small>67</small></sup></span>  Nay, but we are deprived!
<span id="v68"><sup><small>68</small></sup></span>  Have ye observed the water which ye drink ?
<span id="v69"><sup><small>69</small></sup></span>  Is it ye who shed it from the raincloud, or are We the Shedder ?
<span id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup></span>  If We willed We verily could make it bitter. Why then, give ye not thanks ?
<span id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup></span>  Have ye observed the fire which ye strike out;
<span id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup></span>  Was it ye who made the tree thereof to grow, or were We the grower ?
<span id="v73"><sup><small>73</small></sup></span>  We, even We, appointed it a memorial and a comfort for the dwellers in the wilderness.
<span id="v74"><sup><small>74</small></sup></span>  Therefor (O Muhammad), praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous.
<span id="v75"><sup><small>75</small></sup></span>  Nay, I swear by the places of the stars -
<span id="v76"><sup><small>76</small></sup></span>  And lo! that verily is a tremendous oath, if ye but knew -
<span id="v77"><sup><small>77</small></sup></span>  That (this) is indeed a noble Qur'an
<span id="v78"><sup><small>78</small></sup></span>  In a Book kept hidden
<span id="v79"><sup><small>79</small></sup></span>  Which none toucheth save the purified,
<span id="v80"><sup><small>80</small></sup></span>  A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
<span id="v81"><sup><small>81</small></sup></span>  Is it this Statement that ye scorn,
<span id="v82"><sup><small>82</small></sup></span>  And make denial thereof your livelihood ?
<span id="v83"><sup><small>83</small></sup></span>  Why, then, when (the soul) cometh up to the throat (of the dying)
<span id="v84"><sup><small>84</small></sup></span>  And ye are at that moment looking
<span id="v85"><sup><small>85</small></sup></span>  - And We are nearer unto him than ye are, but ye see not -
<span id="v86"><sup><small>86</small></sup></span>  Why then, if ye are not in bondage (unto Us),
<span id="v87"><sup><small>87</small></sup></span>  Do ye not force it back, if ye are truthful ?
<span id="v88"><sup><small>88</small></sup></span>  Thus if he is of those brought nigh,
<span id="v89"><sup><small>89</small></sup></span>  Then breath of life, and plenty, and a Garden of delight.
<span id="v90"><sup><small>90</small></sup></span>  And if he is of those on the right hand,
<span id="v91"><sup><small>91</small></sup></span>  Then (the greeting) “Peace be unto thee” from those on the right hand.
<span id="v92"><sup><small>92</small></sup></span>  But if he is of the rejecters, the erring,
<span id="v93"><sup><small>93</small></sup></span>  Then the welcome will be boiling water
<span id="v94"><sup><small>94</small></sup></span>  And roasting at hell-fire.
<span id="v95"><sup><small>95</small></sup></span>  Lo! this is certain truth.
<span id="v96"><sup><small>96</small></sup></span>  Therefor (O Muhammad) praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous.
