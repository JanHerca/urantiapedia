<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By the Dawn
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And ten nights,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And the Even and the Odd,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And the night when it departeth,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  There surely is an oath for thinking man.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Dost thou not consider how thy Lord dealt with (the tribe of) A'ad,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  With many-columned Iram,
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  The like of which was not created in the lands;
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And with (the tribe of) Thamud, who clove the rocks in the valley;
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And with Pharaoh, firm of might,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Who (all) were rebellious (to Allah) in these lands,
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  And multiplied iniquity therein ?
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  Therefore thy Lord poured on them the disaster of His punishment.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  Lo! thy Lord is ever watchful.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  As for man, whenever his Lord trieth him by honouring him, and is gracious unto him, he saith: My Lord honoureth me.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  But whenever He trieth him by straitening his means of life, he saith: My Lord despiseth me.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Nay, but ye (for your part) honour not the orphan
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  And urge not on the feeding of the poor.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  And ye devour heritages with devouring greed.
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And love wealth with abounding love.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Nay, but when the earth is ground to atoms, grinding, grinding,
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  And thy Lord shall come with angels, rank on rank,
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  And hell is brought near that day; on that day man will remember, but how will the remembrance (then avail him) ?
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  He will say: Ah, would that I had sent before me (some provision) for my life!
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  None punisheth as He will punish on that day!
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  None bindeth as He then will bind.
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  But ah! thou soul at peace!
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  Return unto thy Lord, content in His good pleasure!
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  Enter thou among My bondmen!
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  Enter thou My Garden!
