<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Ha. Mim.
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  By the Scripture that maketh plain
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning -
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Whereon every wise command is made clear
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending -
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would be sure.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and Lord of your forefathers.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Nay, but they play in doubt.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce visible smoke
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment.
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  (Then they will say): Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are believers.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain (the Truth) had already come unto them,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And they had turned away from him and said: One taught (by others), a madman ?
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return (to disbelief).
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, (then) in truth We shall punish.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them a noble messenger,
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant.
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to death.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  And he cried unto his Lord, (saying): These are guilty folk.
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be followed,
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind,
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  And the cornlands and the goodly sites
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And pleasant things wherein they took delight!
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  Even so (it was), and We made it an inheritance for other folk;
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom;
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  (We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones.
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures.
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  Lo! these, forsooth, are saying:
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again.
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth!
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them ? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty.
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in play.
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not.
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them,
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped,
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful.
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  Lo! the tree of Zaqqum,
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  The food of the sinner!
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  As the seething of boiling water.
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  (And it will be said): Take him and drag him to the midst of hell,
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water.
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  (Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble!
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured.
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  Amid gardens and watersprings,
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another.
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  Even so (it will be). And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely eyes.
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  They call therein for every fruit in safety.
<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them from the doom of hell,
<span id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup></span>  A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph.
<span id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup></span>  And We have made (this Scripture) easy in thy language only that they may heed.
<span id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup></span>  Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too) are waiting.
