<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  O thou enveloped in thy cloak,
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Arise and warn!
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Thy Lord magnify,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Thy raiment purify,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Pollution shun!
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  And show not favour, seeking wordly gain!
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  For the sake of thy Lord, be patient!
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  For when the trumpet shall sound,
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Surely that day will be a day of anguish,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Not of ease, for disbelievers.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely,
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  And then bestowed upon him ample means,
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And sons abiding in his presence
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And made (life) smooth for him.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Yet he desireth that I should give more.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Nay! For lo! he hath been stubborn to Our revelations.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  On him I shall impose a fearful doom.
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  For lo! he did consider; then he planned -
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  (Self-)destroyed is he, how he planned!
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  Again (self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! -
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Then looked he,
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  Then frowned he and showed displeasure.
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Then turned he away in pride
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  And said: This is naught else than magic from of old;
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  This is naught else than speech of mortal man.
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Him shall I fling unto the burning.
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>   - Ah, what will convey unto thee what that burning is! -
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  It leaveth naught; it spareth naught
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  It shrivelleth the man.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  Above it are nineteen.
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and their number have We made to be a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to whom the Scripture hath been given may have certainty, and that believers may increase in faith; and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given and believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say: What meaneth Allah by this similitude ? Thus Allah sendeth astray whom He will, and whom He will He guideth. None knoweth the hosts of thy Lord save Him. This is naught else than a Reminder unto mortals.
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  Nay, by the Moon
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  And the night when it withdraweth
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  And the dawn when it shineth forth,
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  Lo! this is one of the greatest (portents)
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  As a warning unto men,
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Unto him of you who will advance or hang back.
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  Every soul is a pledge for its own deeds;
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  Save those who will stand on the right hand.
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  In gardens they will ask one another
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  Concerning the guilty:
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  What hath brought you to this burning ?
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  They will answer: We were not of those who prayed
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Nor did we feed the wretched.
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  We used to wade (in vain dispute) with (all) waders,
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  And we used to deny the Day of Judgment,
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  Till the Inevitable came unto us.
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  The mediation of no mediators will avail them then.
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  Why now turn they away from the Admonishment,
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  As they were frightened asses
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  Fleeing from a lion ?
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  Nay, but everyone of them desireth that he should be given open pages (from Allah).
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  Nay, verily. They fear not the Hereafter.
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  Nay, verily. Lo! this is an Admonishment.
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  So whosoever will may heed.
<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  And they will not heed unless Allah willeth (it). He is the fount of fear. He is the fount of Mercy.
