<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain.
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And if they behold a portent they turn away and say: Prolonged illusion.
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  They denied (the Truth) and followed their own lusts. Yet everything will come to a decision
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And surely there hath come unto them news whereof the purport should deter,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Effective wisdom; but warnings avail not.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) on the day when the Summoner summoneth unto a painful thing.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  With downcast eyes, they come forth from the graves as they were locusts spread abroad,
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Hastening toward the summoner; the disbelievers say: This is a hard day.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  The folk of Noah denied before them, yea, they denied Our slave and said: A madman; and he was repulsed.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am vanquished, so give help.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Then opened We the gates of heaven with pouring water
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  And caused the earth to gush forth springs, so that the waters met for a predestined purpose.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  That ran (upon the waters) in Our sight, as a reward for him who was rejected.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth ?
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings!
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ?
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  (The tribe of) A'ad rejected warnings. Then how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity,
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings!
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ?
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  (The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow ? Then indeed we should fall into error and madness.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us ? Nay, but he is a rash liar.
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  (Unto their warner it was said): To-morrow they will know who is the rash liar.
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and have patience;
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them. Every drinking will be witnessed.
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  But they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung (her).
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings!
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and they became as the dry twigs (rejected by) the builder of a cattle-fold.
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ?
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  The folk of Lot rejected warnings.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them (all) save the family of Lot, whom We rescued in the last watch of the night,
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks.
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  And he indeed had warned them of Our blow, but they did doubt the warnings.
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  They even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose. Then We blinded their eyes (and said): Taste now My punishment after My warnings!
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  And in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning.
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  Now taste My punishment after My warnings!
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ?
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  And warnings came in truth unto the house of Pharaoh
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  Who denied Our revelations, every one. Therefore We grasped them with the grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful.
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  Are your disbelievers better than those, or have ye some immunity in the scriptures ?
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Or say they: We are a host victorious ?
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  The hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee.
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  Nay, but the Hour (of doom) is their appointed tryst, and the Hour will be more wretched and more bitter (than their earthly failure).
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  Lo! the guilty are in error and madness.
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  On the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon their faces (it is said unto them): Feel the touch of hell.
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  Lo! We have created every thing by measure.
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  And Our commandment is but one (commandment), as the twinkling of an eye.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  And verily We have destroyed your fellows; but is there any that remembereth ?
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  And every thing they did is in the scriptures,
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  And every small and great thing is recorded.
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  Lo! the righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers,
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  Firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King.
