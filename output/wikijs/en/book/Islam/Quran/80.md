<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  He frowned and turned away
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Because the blind man came unto him.
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  What could inform thee but that he might grow (in grace)
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Or take heed and so the reminder might avail him ?
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  As for him who thinketh himself independent,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Unto him thou payest regard.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Yet it is not thy concern if he grow not (in grace).
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  But as for him who cometh unto thee with earnest purpose
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And hath fear,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  From him thou art distracted.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Nay, but verily it is an Admonishment,
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  So let whosoever will pay heed to it,
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  On honoured leaves
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  Exalted, purified,
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  (Set down) by scribes
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Noble and righteous.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Man is (self-)destroyed: how ungrateful!
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  From what thing doth He create him ?
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  From a drop of seed. He createth him and proportioneth him,
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  Then maketh the way easy for him,
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Then causeth him to die, and burieth him;
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  Then, when He will, He bringeth him again to life.
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Nay, but (man) hath not done what He commanded him.
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  Let man consider his food:
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  How We pour water in showers
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Then split the earth in clefts
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And cause the grain to grow therein
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  And grapes and green fodder
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  And olive-trees and palm-trees
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  And garden-closes of thick foliage
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  And fruits and grasses:
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  Provision for you and your cattle.
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  But when the Shout cometh
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  On the day when a man fleeth from his brother
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  And his mother and his father
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  And his wife and his children,
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Every man that day will have concern enough to make him heedless (of others).
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  On that day faces will be bright as dawn,
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  Laughing, rejoicing at good news;
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  And other faces, on that day, with dust upon them,
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  Veiled in darkness,
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  Those are the disbelievers, the wicked.
