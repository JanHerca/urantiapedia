<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture and a plain Reading.
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  It may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were Muslims.
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Let them eat and enjoy life, and let (false) hope beguile them. They will come to know!
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And We destroyed no township but there was a known decree for it.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  And they say: O thou unto whom the Reminder is revealed, lo! thou art indeed a madman!
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Why bringest thou not angels unto us, if thou art of the truthful ?
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  We send not down the angels save with the Fact, and in that case (the disbelievers) would not be tolerated.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  We verily sent (messengers) before thee among the factions of the men of old.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him.
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty:
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  They believe not therein, though the example of the men of old hath gone before.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting through it,
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  They would say: Our sight is wrong - nay, but we are folk bewitched.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  And verily in the heaven we have set mansions of the stars, and We have beautified it for beholders.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  And We have guarded it from every outcast devil,
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Save him who stealeth the hearing, and them doth a clear flame pursue.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  And the earth have We spread out, and placed therein firm hills, and caused each seemly thing to grow therein.
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And we have given unto you livelihoods therein, and unto those for whom ye provide not.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof. And we send it not down save in appointed measure.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky, and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof.
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Lo! and it is We, even We, Who quicken and give death, and We are the Inheritor.
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  And verily We know the eager among you and verily We know the laggards.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Lo! thy Lord will gather them together. Lo! He is Wise, Aware.
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Verily We created man of potter's clay of black mud altered,
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And the jinn did We create aforetime of essential fire.
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  And (remember) when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am creating a mortal out of potter's clay of black mud altered,
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  So, when I have made him and have breathed into him of My Spirit, do ye fall down, prostrating yourselves unto him.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  So the angels fell prostrate, all of them together
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  Save Iblis. He refused to be among the prostrate.
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  He said: O Iblis! What aileth thee that thou art not among the prostrate ?
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  He said: I am not one to prostrate myself unto a mortal whom Thou hast created out of potter's clay of black mud altered!
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  He said: Then go thou forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast.
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  And lo! the curse shall be upon thee till the Day of Judgment.
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised.
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  He said: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  Till the Day of appointed time.
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  He said: My Lord! Because Thou hast sent me astray, I verily shall adorn the path of error for them in the earth, and shall mislead them every one,
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  Save such of them as are Thy perfectly devoted slaves.
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  He said: This is a right course incumbent upon Me:
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  Lo! as for My slaves, thou hast no power over any of them save such of the froward as follow thee,
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  And lo! for all such, hell will be the promised place.
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  It hath seven gates, and each gate hath an appointed portion.
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  Lo! those who ward off (evil) are among gardens and watersprings.
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  (And it is said unto them): Enter them in peace, secure.
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  And We remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts. As brethren, face to face, (they rest) on couches raised.
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  Toil cometh not unto them there, nor will they be expelled from thence.
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  Announce, (O Muhammad) unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful,
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  And that My doom is the dolorous doom.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  And tell them of Abraham's guests,
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  (How) when they came in unto him, and said: Peace. He said: Lo! we are afraid of you.
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  They said: Be not afraid! Lo! we bring thee good tidings of a boy possessing wisdom.
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  He said: Bring ye me good tidings (of a son) when old age hath overtaken me ? Of what then can ye bring good tidings ?
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  They said: We bring thee good tidings in truth. So be not thou of the despairing.
<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  He said: And who despaireth of the mercy of his Lord save those who are astray ?
<span id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup></span>  He said: And afterward what is your business, O ye messengers (of Allah) ?
<span id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup></span>  They said: We have been sent unto a guilty folk,
<span id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup></span>  (All) save the family of Lot. Them we shall deliver every one,
<span id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup></span>  Except his wife, of whom We had decreed that she should be of those who stay behind.
<span id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup></span>  And when the messengers came unto the family of Lot,
<span id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup></span>  He said: Lo! ye are folk unknown (to me).
<span id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup></span>  They said: Nay, but we bring thee that concerning which they keep disputing,
<span id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup></span>  And bring thee the Truth, and lo! we are truth-tellers.
<span id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup></span>  So travel with thy household in a portion of the night, and follow thou their backs. Let none of you turn round, but go whither ye are commanded.
<span id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup></span>  And We made plain the case to him, that the root of them (who did wrong) was to be cut at early morn.
<span id="v67"><sup><small>67</small></sup></span>  And the people of the city came, rejoicing at the news (of new arrivals).
<span id="v68"><sup><small>68</small></sup></span>  He said: Lo! they are my guests. Affront me not!
<span id="v69"><sup><small>69</small></sup></span>  And keep your duty to Allah, and shame me not!
<span id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup></span>  They said; Have we not forbidden you from (entertaining) anyone ?
<span id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup></span>  He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing (so).
<span id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup></span>  By thy life (O Muhammad) they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching death.
<span id="v73"><sup><small>73</small></sup></span>  Then the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the sunrise.
<span id="v74"><sup><small>74</small></sup></span>  And We utterly confounded them, and We rained upon them stones of heated clay.
<span id="v75"><sup><small>75</small></sup></span>  Lo! therein verily are portents for those who read the signs.
<span id="v76"><sup><small>76</small></sup></span>  And lo! it is upon a road still uneffaced.
<span id="v77"><sup><small>77</small></sup></span>  Lo! therein is indeed a portent for believers.
<span id="v78"><sup><small>78</small></sup></span>  And the dwellers in the wood indeed were evil-doers.
<span id="v79"><sup><small>79</small></sup></span>  So we took vengeance on them; and lo! they both are on a high-road plain to see.
<span id="v80"><sup><small>80</small></sup></span>  And the dwellers in Al-Hijr denied (Our) messengers.
<span id="v81"><sup><small>81</small></sup></span>  And we gave them Our revelations, but they were averse to them.
<span id="v82"><sup><small>82</small></sup></span>  And they used to hew out dwellings from the hills, (wherein they dwelt) secure.
<span id="v83"><sup><small>83</small></sup></span>  But the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the morning hour,
<span id="v84"><sup><small>84</small></sup></span>  And that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not.
<span id="v85"><sup><small>85</small></sup></span>  We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save with truth, and lo! the Hour is surely coming. So forgive, (O Muhammad), with a gracious forgiveness.
<span id="v86"><sup><small>86</small></sup></span>  Lo! Thy Lord! He is the All-Wise Creator.
<span id="v87"><sup><small>87</small></sup></span>  We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the great Qur'an.
<span id="v88"><sup><small>88</small></sup></span>  Strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoin, and be not grieved on their account, and lower thy wing (in tenderness) for the believers.
<span id="v89"><sup><small>89</small></sup></span>  And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner,
<span id="v90"><sup><small>90</small></sup></span>  Such as We send down for those who make division,
<span id="v91"><sup><small>91</small></sup></span>  Those who break the Qur'an into parts.
<span id="v92"><sup><small>92</small></sup></span>  Them, by thy Lord, We shall question, every one,
<span id="v93"><sup><small>93</small></sup></span>  Of what they used to do.
<span id="v94"><sup><small>94</small></sup></span>  So proclaim that which thou art commanded, and withdraw from the idolaters.
<span id="v95"><sup><small>95</small></sup></span>  Lo! We defend thee from the scoffers,
<span id="v96"><sup><small>96</small></sup></span>  Who set some other god along with Allah. But they will come to know.
<span id="v97"><sup><small>97</small></sup></span>  Well know We that thy bosom is oppressed by what they say,
<span id="v98"><sup><small>98</small></sup></span>  But hymn the praise of thy Lord, and be of those who make prostration (unto Him).
<span id="v99"><sup><small>99</small></sup></span>  And serve thy Lord till the Inevitable cometh unto thee.
