<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the defrauders:
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Those who when they take the measure from mankind demand it full,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  But if they measure unto them or weight for them, they cause them loss.
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Do such (men) not consider that they will be raised again
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Unto an Awful Day,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  The day when (all) mankind stand before the Lord of the Worlds ?
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Nay, but the record of the vile is in Sijjin -
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Ah! what will convey unto thee what Sijjin is! -
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  A written record.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Those who deny the Day of Judgment
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Which none denieth save each criminal transgressor,
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  Who, when thou readest unto him Our revelations, saith: (Mere) fables of the men of old.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon their hearts.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Nay, but surely on that day they will be covered from (the mercy of) their Lord.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Then lo! they verily will burn in hell,
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  And it will be said (unto them): This is that which ye used to deny.
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Nay, but the record of the righteous is in 'Illiyin -
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Ah, what will convey unto thee what 'Illiyin is! -
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  A written record,
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Attested by those who are brought near (unto their Lord).
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  Lo! the righteous verily are in delight,
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  On couches, gazing,
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  Thou wilt know in their faces the radiance of delight.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  They are given to drink of a pure wine, sealed,
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Whose seal is musk - for this let (all) those strive who strive for bliss -
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And mixed with water of Tasnim,
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  A spring whence those brought near (to Allah) drink.
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  Lo! the guilty used to laugh at those who believed,
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  And wink one to another when they passed them;
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  And when they returned to their own folk, they returned jesting;
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  And when they saw them they said: Lo! these have gone astray.
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  Yet they were not sent as guardians over them.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  This day it is those who believe who have the laugh of disbelievers,
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  On high couches, gazing.
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  Are not the disbelievers paid for what they used to do ?
