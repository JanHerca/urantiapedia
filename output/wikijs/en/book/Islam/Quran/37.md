<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By those who set the ranks in battle order
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And those who drive away (the wicked) with reproof
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And those who read (the Word) for a reminder,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Lo! thy Lord is surely One;
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and Lord of the sun's risings.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the planets;
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  With security from every froward devil.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side,
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual torment;
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and there pursueth him a piercing flame.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they stronger as a creation, or those (others) whom we have created ? Lo! We created them of plastic clay.
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And heed not when they are reminded,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And seek to scoff when they behold a portent.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  And they say: Lo! this is mere magic;
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised (again) ?
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  And our forefathers ?
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold,
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  (And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together with their wives and what they used to worship
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Instead of Allah, and lead them to the path to hell;
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  And stop them, for they must be questioned.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  What aileth you that ye help not one another ?
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Nay, but this day they make full submission.
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning.
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, (swearing that ye spoke the truth).
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves) were not believers.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk.
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are about to taste (the doom).
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray.
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  Lo! thus deal We with the guilty.
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  For when it was said unto them, There is no God save Allah, they were scornful
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet ?
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him).
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom -
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  Ye are requited naught save what ye did -
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  Save single-minded slaves of Allah;
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  For them there is a known provision,
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  Fruits. And they will be honoured
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  In the Gardens of delight,
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  On couches facing one another;
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them,
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  White, delicious to the drinkers,
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby.
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  And with them are those of modest gaze, with lovely eyes,
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  (Pure) as they were hidden eggs (of the ostrich).
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a comrade
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  Who used to say: Art thou in truth of those who put faith (in his words) ?
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we (then) verily be brought to book ?
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  He saith: Will ye look ?
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell.
<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin,
<span id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup></span>  And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I too had been of those haled forth (to doom).
<span id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup></span>  Are we then not to die
<span id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup></span>  Saving our former death, and are we not to be punished ?
<span id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup></span>  Lo! this is the supreme triumph.
<span id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup></span>  For the like of this, then, let the workers work.
<span id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup></span>  Is this better as a welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum ?
<span id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup></span>  Lo! We have appointed it a torment for wrong-doers.
<span id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup></span>  Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell.
<span id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup></span>  Its crop is as it were the heads of devils
<span id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup></span>  And lo! they verily must eat thereof, and fill (their) bellies therewith.
<span id="v67"><sup><small>67</small></sup></span>  And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water
<span id="v68"><sup><small>68</small></sup></span>  And afterward, lo! their return is surely unto hell.
<span id="v69"><sup><small>69</small></sup></span>  They indeed found their fathers astray,
<span id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup></span>  But they make haste (to follow) in their footsteps.
<span id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup></span>  And verily most of the men of old went astray before them,
<span id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup></span>  And verily We sent among them warners.
<span id="v73"><sup><small>73</small></sup></span>  Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned,
<span id="v74"><sup><small>74</small></sup></span>  Save single-minded slaves of Allah.
<span id="v75"><sup><small>75</small></sup></span>  And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer
<span id="v76"><sup><small>76</small></sup></span>  And We saved him and his household from the great distress,
<span id="v77"><sup><small>77</small></sup></span>  And made his seed the survivors,
<span id="v78"><sup><small>78</small></sup></span>  And left for him among the later folk (the salutation):
<span id="v79"><sup><small>79</small></sup></span>  Peace be unto Noah among the peoples!
<span id="v80"><sup><small>80</small></sup></span>  Lo! thus do We reward the good.
<span id="v81"><sup><small>81</small></sup></span>  Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves.
<span id="v82"><sup><small>82</small></sup></span>  Then We did drown the others.
<span id="v83"><sup><small>83</small></sup></span>  And lo! of his persuasion verily was Abraham
<span id="v84"><sup><small>84</small></sup></span>  When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart;
<span id="v85"><sup><small>85</small></sup></span>  When he said unto his father and his folk: What is it that ye worship ?
<span id="v86"><sup><small>86</small></sup></span>  Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah - that ye desire ?
<span id="v87"><sup><small>87</small></sup></span>  What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds ?
<span id="v88"><sup><small>88</small></sup></span>  And he glanced a glance at the stars
<span id="v89"><sup><small>89</small></sup></span>  Then said: Lo! I feel sick!
<span id="v90"><sup><small>90</small></sup></span>  And they turned their backs and went away from him.
<span id="v91"><sup><small>91</small></sup></span>  Then turned he to their gods and said: Will ye not eat ?
<span id="v92"><sup><small>92</small></sup></span>  What aileth you that ye speak not ?
<span id="v93"><sup><small>93</small></sup></span>  Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand.
<span id="v94"><sup><small>94</small></sup></span>  And (his people) came toward him, hastening.
<span id="v95"><sup><small>95</small></sup></span>  He said: Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve
<span id="v96"><sup><small>96</small></sup></span>  When Allah hath created you and what ye make ?
<span id="v97"><sup><small>97</small></sup></span>  They said: Build for him a building and fling him in the red-hotfire.
<span id="v98"><sup><small>98</small></sup></span>  And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost.
<span id="v99"><sup><small>99</small></sup></span>  And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me.
<span id="v100"><sup><small>100</small></sup></span>  My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous.
<span id="v101"><sup><small>101</small></sup></span>  So We gave him tidings of a gentle son.
<span id="v102"><sup><small>102</small></sup></span>  And when (his son) was old enough to walk with him, (Abraham) said: O my dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what thinkest thou ? He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah willing, thou shalt find me of the steadfast.
<span id="v103"><sup><small>103</small></sup></span>  Then, when they had both surrendered (to Allah), and he had flung him down upon his face,
<span id="v104"><sup><small>104</small></sup></span>  We called unto him: O Abraham!
<span id="v105"><sup><small>105</small></sup></span>  Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good.
<span id="v106"><sup><small>106</small></sup></span>  Lo! that verily was a clear test.
<span id="v107"><sup><small>107</small></sup></span>  Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim.
<span id="v108"><sup><small>108</small></sup></span>  And We left for him among the later folk (the salutation):
<span id="v109"><sup><small>109</small></sup></span>  Peace be unto Abraham!
<span id="v110"><sup><small>110</small></sup></span>  Thus do We reward the good.
<span id="v111"><sup><small>111</small></sup></span>  Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves.
<span id="v112"><sup><small>112</small></sup></span>  And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous.
<span id="v113"><sup><small>113</small></sup></span>  And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and some who plainly wrong themselves.
<span id="v114"><sup><small>114</small></sup></span>  And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron,
<span id="v115"><sup><small>115</small></sup></span>  And saved them and their people from the great distress,
<span id="v116"><sup><small>116</small></sup></span>  And helped them so that they became the victors.
<span id="v117"><sup><small>117</small></sup></span>  And We gave them the clear Scripture
<span id="v118"><sup><small>118</small></sup></span>  And showed them the right path.
<span id="v119"><sup><small>119</small></sup></span>  And We left for them among the later folk (the salutation):
<span id="v120"><sup><small>120</small></sup></span>  Peace be unto Moses and Aaron!
<span id="v121"><sup><small>121</small></sup></span>  Lo! thus do We reward the good.
<span id="v122"><sup><small>122</small></sup></span>  Lo! they are two of Our believing slaves.
<span id="v123"><sup><small>123</small></sup></span>  And lo! Elias was of those sent (to warn),
<span id="v124"><sup><small>124</small></sup></span>  When he said unto his folk: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
<span id="v125"><sup><small>125</small></sup></span>  Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators,
<span id="v126"><sup><small>126</small></sup></span>  Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers ?
<span id="v127"><sup><small>127</small></sup></span>  But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth (to the doom)
<span id="v128"><sup><small>128</small></sup></span>  Save single-minded slaves of Allah.
<span id="v129"><sup><small>129</small></sup></span>  And we left for him among the later folk (the salutation):
<span id="v130"><sup><small>130</small></sup></span>  Peace be unto Elias!
<span id="v131"><sup><small>131</small></sup></span>  Lo! thus do We reward the good.
<span id="v132"><sup><small>132</small></sup></span>  Lo! he is one of our believing slaves.
<span id="v133"><sup><small>133</small></sup></span>  And lo! Lot verily was of those sent (to warn).
<span id="v134"><sup><small>134</small></sup></span>  When We saved him and his household, every one,
<span id="v135"><sup><small>135</small></sup></span>  Save an old woman among those who stayed behind;
<span id="v136"><sup><small>136</small></sup></span>  Then We destroyed the others.
<span id="v137"><sup><small>137</small></sup></span>  And lo! ye verily pass by (the ruin of) them in the morning
<span id="v138"><sup><small>138</small></sup></span>  And at night-time; have ye then no sense ?
<span id="v139"><sup><small>139</small></sup></span>  And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent (to warn)
<span id="v140"><sup><small>140</small></sup></span>  When he fled unto the laden ship,
<span id="v141"><sup><small>141</small></sup></span>  And then drew lots and was of those rejected;
<span id="v142"><sup><small>142</small></sup></span>  And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy;
<span id="v143"><sup><small>143</small></sup></span>  And had he not been one of those who glorify (Allah)
<span id="v144"><sup><small>144</small></sup></span>  He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised;
<span id="v145"><sup><small>145</small></sup></span>  Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick;
<span id="v146"><sup><small>146</small></sup></span>  And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him;
<span id="v147"><sup><small>147</small></sup></span>  And We sent him to a hundred thousand (folk) or more
<span id="v148"><sup><small>148</small></sup></span>  And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while.
<span id="v149"><sup><small>149</small></sup></span>  Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have sons ?
<span id="v150"><sup><small>150</small></sup></span>  Or created We the angels females while they were present ?
<span id="v151"><sup><small>151</small></sup></span>  Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say:
<span id="v152"><sup><small>152</small></sup></span>  Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they tell a lie.
<span id="v153"><sup><small>153</small></sup></span>  (And again of their falsehood): He hath preferred daughters to sons.
<span id="v154"><sup><small>154</small></sup></span>  What aileth you ? How judge ye ?
<span id="v155"><sup><small>155</small></sup></span>  Will ye not then reflect ?
<span id="v156"><sup><small>156</small></sup></span>  Or have ye a clear warrant ?
<span id="v157"><sup><small>157</small></sup></span>  Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful.
<span id="v158"><sup><small>158</small></sup></span>  And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought before (Him).
<span id="v159"><sup><small>159</small></sup></span>  Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute (unto Him),
<span id="v160"><sup><small>160</small></sup></span>  Save single-minded slaves of Allah.
<span id="v161"><sup><small>161</small></sup></span>  Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship,
<span id="v162"><sup><small>162</small></sup></span>  Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him.
<span id="v163"><sup><small>163</small></sup></span>  Save him who is to burn in hell.
<span id="v164"><sup><small>164</small></sup></span>  There is not one of us but hath his known position.
<span id="v165"><sup><small>165</small></sup></span>  Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks,
<span id="v166"><sup><small>166</small></sup></span>  Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise
<span id="v167"><sup><small>167</small></sup></span>  And indeed they used to say:
<span id="v168"><sup><small>168</small></sup></span>  If we had but a reminder from the men of old
<span id="v169"><sup><small>169</small></sup></span>  We would be single-minded slaves of Allah.
<span id="v170"><sup><small>170</small></sup></span>  Yet (now that it is come) they disbelieve therein; but they will come to know.
<span id="v171"><sup><small>171</small></sup></span>  And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent (to warn)
<span id="v172"><sup><small>172</small></sup></span>  That they verily would be helped,
<span id="v173"><sup><small>173</small></sup></span>  And that Our host, they verily would be the victors.
<span id="v174"><sup><small>174</small></sup></span>  So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) awhile,
<span id="v175"><sup><small>175</small></sup></span>  And watch, for they will (soon) see.
<span id="v176"><sup><small>176</small></sup></span>  Would they hasten on Our doom ?
<span id="v177"><sup><small>177</small></sup></span>  But when it cometh home to them, then it will be a hapless morn for those who have been warned.
<span id="v178"><sup><small>178</small></sup></span>  Withdraw from them awhile
<span id="v179"><sup><small>179</small></sup></span>  And watch, for they will (soon) see.
<span id="v180"><sup><small>180</small></sup></span>  Glorified be thy Lord, the Lord of Majesty, from that which they attribute (unto Him)
<span id="v181"><sup><small>181</small></sup></span>  And peace be unto those sent (to warn).
<span id="v182"><sup><small>182</small></sup></span>  And praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds!
