<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By the night enshrouding
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And the day resplendent
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And Him Who hath created male and female,
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Lo! your effort is dispersed (toward divers ends).
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  As for him who giveth and is dutiful (toward Allah)
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  And believeth in goodness;
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Surely We will ease his way unto the state of ease.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  But as for him who hoardeth and deemeth himself independent,
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And disbelieveth in goodness;
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Surely We will ease his way unto adversity.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  His riches will not save him when he perisheth.
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Lo! Ours it is (to give) the guidance
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And lo! unto Us belong the latter portion and the former.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  Therefor have I warned you of the flaming Fire
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Which only the most wretched must endure,
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  He who denieth and turneth away.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Far removed from it will be the righteous
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Who giveth his wealth that he may grow (in goodness).
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  And none hath with him any favour for reward,
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  Except as seeking (to fulfil) the purpose of his Lord Most High.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  He verily will be content.
