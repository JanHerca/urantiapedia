<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection;
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  Nay, I swear by the accusing soul (that this Scripture is true).
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Thinketh man that We shall not assemble his bones ?
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  Yea, verily. We are Able to restore his very fingers!
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  But man would fain deny what is before him.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  He asketh: When will be this Day of Resurrection ?
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  But when sight is confounded
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  And the moon is eclipsed
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And sun and moon are united,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  On that day man will cry: Whither to flee!
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Alas! No refuge!
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Unto thy Lord is the recourse that day.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  On that day man is told the tale of that which he hath sent before and left behind.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  Oh, but man is a telling witness against himself,
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Although he tender his excuses.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Stir not thy tongue herewith to hasten it.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Lo! upon Us (resteth) the putting together thereof and the reading thereof.
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  And when We read it, follow thou the reading;
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Then lo! upon Us (resteth) the explanation thereof.
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  Nay, but ye do love the fleeting Now
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  And neglect the Hereafter.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  That day will faces be resplendent,
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Looking toward their Lord;
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  And that day will other faces be despondent,
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Thou wilt know that some great disaster is about to fall on them.
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Nay, but when the life cometh up to the throat
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And men say: Where is the wizard (who can save him now) ?
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  And he knoweth that it is the parting;
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  And agony is heaped on agony;
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  Unto thy Lord that day will be the driving.
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  For he neither trusted, nor prayed.
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  But he denied and flouted.
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  Then went he to his folk with glee.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  Nearer unto thee and nearer,
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  Again nearer unto thee and nearer (is the doom).
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  Thinketh man that he is to be left aimless ?
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Was he not a drop of fluid which gushed forth ?
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  Then he became a clot; then (Allah) shaped and fashioned
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  And made of him a pair, the male and female.
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  Is not He (Who doeth so) Able to bring the dead to life ?
