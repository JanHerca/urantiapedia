<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  When the heaven is split asunder
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  And attentive to her Lord in fear,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  And when the earth is spread out
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  And hath cast out all that was in her, and is empty
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  And attentive to her Lord in fear!
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  Thou, verily, O man, art working toward thy Lord a work which thou wilt meet (in His presence).
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Then whoso is given his account in his right hand
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  He truly will receive an easy reckoning
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And will return unto his folk in joy.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  But whoso is given his account behind his back,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  He surely will invoke destruction
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  And be thrown to scorching fire.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  He verily lived joyous with his folk,
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  He verily deemed that he would never return (unto Allah).
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Nay, but lo! his Lord is ever looking on him!
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Oh, I swear by the afterglow of sunset,
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  And by the night and all that it enshroudeth,
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  And by the moon when she is at the full,
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  That ye shall journey on from plane to plane.
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  What aileth them, then, that they believe not
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  And, when the Qur'an is recited unto them, worship not (Allah) ?
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  Nay, but those who disbelieve will deny;
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  And Allah knoweth best what they are hiding.
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  So give them tidings of a painful doom,
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Save those who believe and do good works, for theirs is a reward unfailing.
