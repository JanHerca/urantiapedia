<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  By the emissary winds, (sent) one after another
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  By the raging hurricanes,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  By those which cause earth's vegetation to revive;
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  By those who winnow with a winnowing,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  By those who bring down the Reminder,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  To excuse or to warn,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Surely that which ye are promised will befall.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  So when the stars are put out,
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And when the sky is riven asunder,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And when the mountains are blown away,
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  And when the messengers are brought unto their time appointed -
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  For what day is the time appointed ?
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  For the Day of Decision.
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And what will convey unto thee what the Day of Decision is! -
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  Destroyed We not the former folk,
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  Then caused the latter folk to follow after ?
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  Thus deal We ever with the guilty.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  Did We not create you from a base fluid
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Which We laid up in a safe abode
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  For a known term ?
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Thus We arranged. How excellent is Our arranging!
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Have We not made the earth a receptacle
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  Both for the living and the dead,
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  And placed therein high mountains and given you to drink sweet water therein ?
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  (It will be said unto them:) Depart unto that (doom) which ye used to deny;
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  Depart unto the shadow falling threefold,
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  (Which yet is) no relief nor shelter from the flame.
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  Lo! it throweth up sparks like the castles,
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  (Or) as it might be camels of bright yellow hue.
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  This is a day wherein they speak not,
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  Nor are they suffered to put forth excuses.
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  This is the Day of Decision, We have brought you and the men of old together.
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  If now ye have any wit, outwit Me.
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  Lo! those who kept their duty are amid shade and fountains,
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  And fruits such as they desire.
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  (Unto them it is said:) Eat, drink and welcome, O ye blessed, in return for what ye did.
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Thus do We reward the good.
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  Eat and take your ease (on earth) a little. Lo! ye are guilty.
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  When it is said unto them: Bow down, they bow not down!
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  Woe unto the repudiators on that day!
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  In what statement, after this, will they believe ?
