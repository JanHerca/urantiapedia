<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  The Reality!
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  What is the Reality ?
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Ah, what will convey unto thee what the reality is!
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  (The tribes of) Thamud and A'ad disbelieved in the judgment to come.
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the lightning.
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind,
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Which He imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Canst thou (O Muhammad) see any remnant of them ?
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And Pharaoh and those before him, and the communities that were destroyed, brought error,
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, therefor did He grip them with a tightening grip.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you upon the ship
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  That We might make it a memorial for you, and that remembering ears (that heard the story) might remember.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  And when the trumpet shall sound one blast
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one crash,
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  Then, on that day will the Event befall.
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  And the heaven will split asunder, for that day it will be frail.
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne of thy Lord that day, above them.
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say: Take, read my book!
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  Surely I knew that I should have to meet my reckoning.
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Then he will be in blissful state
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  In a high garden
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Whereof the clusters are in easy reach.
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  (And it will be said unto those therein): Eat and drink at ease for that which ye sent on before you in past days.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say: Oh, would that I had not been given my book
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  And knew not what my reckoning!
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  Oh, would that it had been death!
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  My wealth hath not availed me,
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  My power hath gone from me.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  (It will be said): Take him and fetter him
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  And then expose him to hell-fire
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  And then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits.
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the Tremendous,
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  And urged not on the feeding of the wretched.
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  Therefor hath he no lover here this day,
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  Nor any food save filth
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  Which none but sinners eat.
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  But nay! I swear by all that ye see
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  And all that ye see not
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger.
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe!
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember!
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us,
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  We assuredly had taken him by the right hand
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  And then severed his life-artery,
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  And not one of you could have held Us off from him.
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off (evil).
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  And lo! We know that some among you will deny (it).
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  And lo! it is absolute truth.
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord.
