<span id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></span>  Ya Sin.
<span id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></span>  By the wise Qur'an,
<span id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></span>  Lo! thou art of those sent
<span id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></span>  On a straight path,
<span id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></span>  A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful,
<span id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></span>  That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless.
<span id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></span>  Already hath the judgment, (for their infidelity) proved true of most of them, for they believe not.
<span id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></span>  Lo! We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins, so that they are made stiff-necked.
<span id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></span>  And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and (thus) have covered them so that they see not.
<span id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></span>  Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they believe not.
<span id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></span>  Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward.
<span id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></span>  Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send before (them, and their footprints. And all things We have kept in a clear Register.
<span id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></span>  Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent (from Allah) came unto them;
<span id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></span>  When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you.
<span id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></span>  They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught revealed. Ye do but lie!
<span id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></span>  They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you,
<span id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></span>  And our duty is but plain conveyance (of the message).
<span id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></span>  (The people of the city) said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands.
<span id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></span>  They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of the truth) ? Nay, but ye are froward folk!
<span id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></span>  And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried: O my people! Follow those who have been sent!
<span id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></span>  Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided.
<span id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></span>  For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto Whom ye will be brought back ?
<span id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></span>  Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save ?
<span id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></span>  Then truly I should be in error manifest.
<span id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></span>  Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me!
<span id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></span>  It was said (unto him): Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew
<span id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></span>  With what (munificence) my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones!
<span id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></span>  We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do We ever send.
<span id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></span>  It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct.
<span id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></span>  Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him!
<span id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></span>  Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which indeed returned not unto them;
<span id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></span>  But all, without exception, will be brought before Us.
<span id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></span>  A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it grain so that they eat thereof;
<span id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></span>  And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein,
<span id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></span>  That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they not, then, give thanks ?
<span id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></span>  Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not!
<span id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></span>  A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in darkness.
<span id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></span>  And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise.
<span id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></span>  And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm-leaf.
<span id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></span>  It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit.
<span id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></span>  And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship,
<span id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></span>  And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride.
<span id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></span>  And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can they be saved;
<span id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></span>  Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while.
<span id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></span>  When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless).
<span id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></span>  Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn away from it!
<span id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></span>  And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom Allah, if He willed, would feed ? Ye are in naught else than error manifest.
<span id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></span>  And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ?
<span id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></span>  They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing.
<span id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></span>  Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk.
<span id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></span>  And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord,
<span id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></span>  Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep ? This is that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth.
<span id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></span>  It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us!
<span id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></span>  This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye used to do.
<span id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></span>  Lo! those who merit paradise this day are happily employed,
<span id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></span>  They and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining;
<span id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup></span>  Theirs the fruit (of their good deeds) and theirs (all) that they ask;
<span id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup></span>  The word from a Merciful Lord (for them) is: Peace!
<span id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup></span>  But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day!
<span id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup></span>  Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo! he is your open foe! -
<span id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup></span>  But that ye worship Me ? That was the right path.
<span id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup></span>  Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude. Had ye then no sense ?
<span id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup></span>  This is hell which ye were promised (if ye followed him).
<span id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup></span>  Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved.
<span id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup></span>  This day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and their feet bear witness as to what they used to earn.
<span id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup></span>  And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that they should struggle for the way. Then how could they have seen ?
<span id="v67"><sup><small>67</small></sup></span>  And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place, making them powerless to go forward or turn back.
<span id="v68"><sup><small>68</small></sup></span>  He whom we bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation (making him go back to weakness after strength). Have ye then no sense ?
<span id="v69"><sup><small>69</small></sup></span>  And We have not taught him (Muhammad) poetry, nor is it meet for him. This is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain,
<span id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup></span>  To warn whosoever liveth, and that the word may be fulfilled against the disbelievers.
<span id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup></span>  Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the cattle, so that they are their owners,
<span id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup></span>  And have subdued them unto them, so that some of them they have for riding, some for food ?
<span id="v73"><sup><small>73</small></sup></span>  Benefits and (divers) drinks have they from them. Will they not then give thanks ?
<span id="v74"><sup><small>74</small></sup></span>  And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, in order that they may be helped.
<span id="v75"><sup><small>75</small></sup></span>  It is not in their power to help them; but they (the worshippers) are unto them a host in arms.
<span id="v76"><sup><small>76</small></sup></span>  So let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! We know what they conceal and what proclaim.
<span id="v77"><sup><small>77</small></sup></span>  Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed ? Yet lo! he is an open opponent.
<span id="v78"><sup><small>78</small></sup></span>  And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away ?
<span id="v79"><sup><small>79</small></sup></span>  Say: He will revive them Who produced them at the first, for He is Knower of every creation,
<span id="v80"><sup><small>80</small></sup></span>  Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree, and behold! ye kindle from it.
<span id="v81"><sup><small>81</small></sup></span>  Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of them ? Aye, that He is! for He is the All-Wise Creator,
<span id="v82"><sup><small>82</small></sup></span>  But His command, when He intendeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it: Be! and it is.
<span id="v83"><sup><small>83</small></sup></span>  Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things! Unto Him ye will be brought back.
