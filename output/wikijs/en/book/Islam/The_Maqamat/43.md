‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I happened to have made a vow to give a dinar in charity to the greatest mendicant in Baghdad. I enquired for him and I was directed to Abú’l Fatḥ al-Iskanderí. So I went to him to bestow it upon him, and I found him amongst some companions who had gathered in a circle around him. So I said: ‘O sons of Sásán, which of you knows his stock-in-trade best and is the sharpest in his art so that I may give him this dinar?’ Said al-Iskanderí: ‘I am.’ Another of the company said: ‘Nay, but I am.’ Then they wrangled and disputed till I said: ‘Let each of you revile his fellow, then whoever gains the mastery carries off the booty, and whoever overcomes takes the spoil.’ [^980] So al-Iskanderí said: ‘O cold of the old woman! [^981] O sultriness of Tammuz! [^982] O <span id="p165"><sup><small>[ p. 165 ]</small></sup></span> filth of the goglet! [^983] O non-current dirhem! O conversation of the singers! [^984] O unfortunate year! O unlucky star! O oppression of the nightmare! [^985] O sick headache! O Ummú Ḥubein! [^986] O ophthalmia! O morning of separation! O estrangement of friends! O hour of death! O scene of the martyrdom of al-Ḥusain! O burden of debt! O mark of infamy! O ill-starred messenger! O banished for his meanness! O porridge of garlic! O desert of the Zaqqum! [^987] O refuser to lend the things of the house! O year of the bubonic plague! O rebellious slave! O damnatory clause! O oft-repeated speech! O worse than ![](/image/book/Islam/The_Maqamat/16500.jpg) (till) in various constructions! O worm of the privy! O furred garment in the summer-quarters! O coughing of the host, when the bread is broken! O belch of the intoxicated! O fetid breath of the hawks! O peg of the tent! [^988] O prop [^989] of the pot! O non-recurring Wednesday! [^990] O avarice of the vanquished at dice! O grumbling of the tongue! O _lotium spadonis!_ O eating of the blind! O intercession of the naked! [^991] O Saturday of the children! [^992] O letter of condolence! [^993] O pool of impurities! O <span id="p166"><sup><small>[ p. 166 ]</small></sup></span> stinginess of the man of Ahwaz! [^994] O garrulousness of the man of Rayy! [^995] By Heavens! if thou wert to place one of thy feet on Arwand [^996] and the other on Demawand, [^997] take in thy hand the rainbow and card the clouds in the garments of the angels, thou wouldst only be a wool-carder!’

Then said the other: ‘O trainer of monkeys! O felt of the Jews! O fetid breath of the lions! O non-entity in existence! O dog in strife! O monkey on the carpet! O pumpkin with pulse! [^998] O less than nothing! O fumes of naphtha! [^999] O stench of the armpit! O decline of power! O halo of death! O viler than one to whom clings the disgrace of divorce and refuses to return the marriage dowry! O mud of the road! O water taken in the state of fasting! [^1000] O shaker of the bone! [^1001] O accelerator of digestion! O tartar of the teeth! O filth of the ears! O tougher than the rope of cocoanut fibre! O less than a _fals!_ [^1002] O more traitorous than a tear! O more rebellious than a needle! O direction of the boot! O landing-place of the palms! O the word ‘would that’! O leaking of the house! O such and <span id="p167">[<sup><small>167</small></sup>]</span> such! [^1003] By Heavens! wert thou to place thy _seant_ on the stars and extend thy feet to the limits of the world, take Sirius as a boot and the Pleiades as a raiment, and wert to make the sky a loom, weave the air into a coat, make its woof with the Flying Vulture and weave it with the revolving sphere, thou wouldest be but a weaver!’ [^1004]

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: ‘By Heavens! I did not know which of the two I should prefer, for nought proceeded ’from them save marvellous language, wonderful aptness, and intense enmity. So I left the dinar before them undivided and I know not what Time did with them.’

[^981]: 164:3 _Cold of the old woman:_ That is, the four last days of February and three first days of March, thus called because they are the latter part (…) of winter.

[^985]: 165:3 … _Oppression of the nightmare:_ Some think this is not an Arabic word and that the proper word is … (Lane, p. 2588). I see no difficulty, however, in evolving this meaning from the root … he pressed or squeezed.

[^986]: 165:4 _Ummu Ḥubein:_ A species of stinking lizard.

[^987]: 165:5 _Zaqqum:_ A certain kind of tree having small leaves, evil-smelling and bitter, found in Tehameh, also the name of the infernal tree whose fruit is the food of the people of hell. See Baiḍáwí, ii, 172.

[^988]: 165:6 _O peg of the tent:_ Cf. more dishevelled than a tent peg. Freytag, _Arab Proverbs_, i, 706.

[^989]: 165:7 … _Prop:_ Literally, the handle of the upper millstone,

[^990]: 165:8 … _Non-recurring Wednesday:_ The unlucky Wednesdays of the month, to which this is an allusion, are those which have the number four, e.g. the fourth or the fourteenth of the month; the fourteenth or twenty-fourth, or the fourth before the end of the month. Mas‘údí, _Les Prairies D’or_, iii, 422. Freytag, _Arab Proverbs_, i, 276 and Meidaní (Bulak edition), i, 139, when it comes at the end of the month.

[^991]: 165:9 _O intercession of the naked:_ That is, one who is so utterly destitute that he needs to ask for himself, not for others. For the opposite sentiment, see _Aghání_, viii, 182.

[^992]: 165:10 _O Saturday of the children:_ Succeeding the holiday on Friday, Cf. English school slang, Black Monday.

[^993]: 165:11 _O letter of condolence!_ Because it is supposed to be a very difficult thing p. 166 to write if the deceased is not a near relative, or because it is a painful thing for one who is bereaved to read.

[^994]: 166:1 _Stinginess of the man of Ahwaz:_ The people of Ahwaz were notorious for their avarice, stupidity and the vileness of their inclinations. Yaqút, i, 411, 12.

[^995]: 166:2 _Garrulousness of the man of Rayy:_ The word … also means meddlesomeness, or immoderation of any kind, but I have not been able to find any evidence that the people of Rayy were notorious for any of these things.

[^999]: 166:6 _O fumes of naphtha!:_ Apparently a genuine Arabic word from …. It (water) welled or issued forth, and … what oozes or exudes from a mountain as though it were sweat from the sides of the rock. (Lane's Lexicon art. … p. 2759) Cf. Greek ναφθα which is probably a loan word from Arabic.

[^1000]: 166:7 … _In a state of fasting:_ Anything eaten or drunk in a state of fasting. The text is wrongly vocalized, for … read ….

[^1001]: 166:8 _Shaker of the bone:_ That is, ague.

[^1002]: 166:9 … _A fals:_ A small copper coin, the forty-eighth part of a dirhem, i.e. about half a farthing. A loan word from Aramaic.

[^1003]: 167:1 _O such and such:_ Or ‘so and so’, referring to something too gross to mention. Cf. _Ḥarírí_, p. 235, line 3., and see Wright's Grammar, i, 268.
