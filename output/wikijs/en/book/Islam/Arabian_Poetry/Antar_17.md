Immediately on receiving Monzar's audacious message, the King of Persia despatched his satrap Khosrewan (the original cause of all the trouble), with a large army, to chastise his Arabian vassal. On the approach of the Persians, Monzar collected all the clans of the tribe of Shiban, and all the Arab hordes, and, giving battle to Khosrewan, was signally defeated. In his extremity he thought of his prisoner, the lion-slayer. Antar was freed from his fetters, and brought before Monzar.

“I am now in your power,” said the hero; “and I demand of you the marriage dower of Abla, my uncle's daughter: restore my sword, my cuirass, my arms, and my horse, and give me a thousand men to defend my rear; and you shall see what my courage and force will effect against your foes.”

Monzar swore, by the sacred Kaaba, that if Antar proved successful in destroying the Persian army, all his camels should be at his disposal, and ordered the hero's horse and arms to be restored to him.

Early on the morrow the Arabs went forth against the Persians, and at their head was Antar, who, exclaiming, “By thine eyes, O Abla!” received the attack of the enemy “as the parched ground the first of the rain.” The Persians were mowed <span id="p220">[<sup><small>220</small></sup>]</span> down by the irresistible Dhami: terror seized upon their hearts at the sound of his voice, “like the thunder's peal”; and his sword-strokes were more rapid than the flashes of lightning: the army of Monzar was victorious.
