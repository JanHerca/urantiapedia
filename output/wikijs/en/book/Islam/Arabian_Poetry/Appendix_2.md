\[Having reviewed the long line of Himyarite princes, who were, each in his day, “possessed of power for evil or for good,” the Poet thus moralises in conclusion.\]

129\. The chiefs of Himyar, and their kings, are buried in the dust, to rest in graves beneath slabs of stones.

130\. They have become dust, they are trodden on like as Death treads upon the mounds of earth and the pebbles of the watercourse.

131\. The world they lived in submitted to them, then turned away and smote them with its kicking hoof.

132\. There rained upon them, after the clouds of their prosperity, the clouds of misfortune in heavy-pouring showers.

133\. The accidents of Time had no regard for them, nor could they defend themselves from them with swords or lances;

134\. No, not with troops and with palaces; nor with armies, and fortresses, and weapons.

135\. They have their dwelling in the earth, after _living in_ castles, and delighting themselves with eating and drinking, and the pleasures of wedlock.

136\. Their castles, which were built on supports of wide-spreading stone, have become as smouldering wood.

137\. Time mingles its misfortunes with its favours, and affects its children with misery in _the midst_ of joy.

138\. Praise be to God, whose beneficence is to be hoped for! may He remain an object of praise in the morning and the evening!

139\. And may blessings he upon the Prophet and his followers, as long as the winged pigeon may coo!
