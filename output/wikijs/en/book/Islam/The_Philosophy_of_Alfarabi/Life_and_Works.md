Alfarabi, Muhammad Ben Tarkhan Abu Nasr Alfarabi, was born at Farb (now Otrar) toward the end of the ninth century of our era. Though of Turkish descent, he received his philosophical training under the tutorship of the Christian philosopher, Yuhanna Ben Hailan. Later he went to Baghdad, at that time the center of Greek philosophy. Going to Aleppo, he lived at the court of Seif-Eddaula Ali Ben Hamdan, arousing the admiration of all by his skill in dialectics. After a lengthy stay at Aleppo he went to Damascus with his patron, where he died in December of the year 950 A.D.

In logic he wrote _Introduction to Logic_ and _Abridgment of Logic_. In the natural sciences he wrote commentaries on Aristotle's _Physics_, _Meteorology_, _De Coelo et Mundo_. He also wrote an essay on The Movement of the Heavenly Spheres.

In Psychology he wrote a commentary on Alexander of Aphrodisias' _De Anima_ as well as various treatises on the _Soul_, the _Power of the Soul_, the _Unity and the One_, on the _Intelligence and the Intelligible_ (i.e. on the various meanings of the word “intellect” as found in Aristotle.)

In Metaphysics he wrote essays on _Substance_, _Time_, _Space_ and _Measure_, and various treatises entitled _The Gems of Wisdom_, A _Letter in Reply to Certain Questions_, _The Sources of Questions_, _The Knowledge of the Creator_.

In Ethics he wrote a commentary on the _Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle_. Of his original works the following are best known:

_Encyclopedia_, in which he gives a brief account and definition of all branches of science and art.

_Political Regime_, which is known as the _Book of Principles_. The reading of this book is recommended by Maimonides in these terms: “I recommend you to read no works on Logic other than those of the philosopher Abu Nasr Alfarabi, since all that he wrote, especially the _Book of Principles_, is as fine flour.”
