## SADI'S SCROLL OF WISDOM

_In the Name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate!_

O merciful Being! take pity on our condition;
For we are captives in the snare of lust!
We have no protector save Thee!
Thou art the all-sufficient Forgiver of sins to us sinners!
Keep us from the path of error;
Forgive us our trespasses, and show us righteousness.


<span id="p30"><sup><small>[ p. 30 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="s2"></span>

## IN PRAISE OF MUHAMMAD

The Peace of God be upon him and his Posterity!
So long as the tongue is fixed in the mouth,
May the praise of Muhammad be a source of delight.
The beloved of God, the most exalted of Prophets,
Whose pillow is the glorious firmament.
The earth-conquering horseman with his chestnut Buraq, [^5]
Which passed beyond the palace of the cerulean portico!

<span id="s3"></span>

## ADDRESS TO THE SOUL

Forty years of thy precious existence have expired; <span id="p31"><sup><small>[ p. 31 ]</small></sup></span>
Yet thy life hath not passed beyond childhood.
Thou hast spent all in lust and licence;
Not a moment hast thou acted according to righteousness.
Rely not upon unstable life;
Be not confident that thou art safe from the sport of fortune.

<span id="s4"></span>

## IN PRAISE OF GENEROSITY

O soul! whoever spreadeth the table of benevolence
Is famous in the world of liberality.
Generosity will make thee renowned throughout the universe;
Generosity will secure thee happiness.
Beside generosity there is nothing in the world,
Nor is aught more current in any market!
Generosity will be the source of delight; <span id="p32"><sup><small>[ p. 32 ]</small></sup></span>
Generosity will be the harvest of life.
Freshen the heart of the world by generosity;
Fill the globe with the renown of thy generosity.
For ever be steadfast in generosity;
Since the Creator of the soul is beneficent.

<span id="s5"></span>

## DESCRIPTION OF BENEVOLENCE

The man of good parts maketh choice of benevolence;
For mankind becometh prosperous from benevolence.
Be conqueror of the world through kindness and benevolence;
Be a chief in the kingdom of kindness and generosity.
Benevolence is the attribute of men of piety,
Benevolence is the duty of the prosperous.
Benevolence is the touchstone of the alloy of sin, <span id="p33"><sup><small>[ p. 33 ]</small></sup></span>
Benevolence is the medicine for all ills.
Be not, if you can, void of benevolence,
That you may snatch the ball of excellence owing to benevolence.

<span id="s6"></span>

## IN CONDEMNATION OF PARSIMONY

Were the spheres to fall to the share of the miser,
Were fortune the slave of the miser,
Were the wealth of Korah [^6] in his hand,
Were a quarter of the universe subservient to him
The miser is not worthy that thou shouldest mention his name.
And were fortune to become his servant,
Pay no regard to the property of the miser—
Speak not of the miser's property and possessions.
Were the miser a devotee both on land and sea, <span id="p34"><sup><small>[ p. 34 ]</small></sup></span>
He would be so it is ordered—unknown in Paradise.
Though the miser be rich in possessions,
He would suffer distress, as if he were a poor man.
Benevolent persons enjoy the fruit of their wealth;
The niggardly suffer grief from their gold and silver.

<span id="s7"></span>

## DESCRIPTION OF HUMILITY

O soul! if thou makest choice of humility,
The people of the world will be thy friends.
Humility will augment thy station,
Just as the moon gets light from the sun.
Humility is the source of intimacy,
For exalted will be the dignity of friendship.
Humility exalteth a man,
Humility is a decoration to men of position.
Every one who is human is humble;
Nought becometh a man save magnanimity. <span id="p35"><sup><small>[ p. 35 ]</small></sup></span>
The man of wisdom maketh choice of humility;
The bough laden with fruit rests upon the earth.
Humility will increase thy reputation,
It will get thee a place in the glorious Paradise.
Humility is the key of the gate of Heaven;
It is an ornament to position and dignity.
Whoever is accustomed to humility
Will enjoy rank and power.
Whoever is born to command,
It is more than delightful to find in him humility.
Humility will make thee beloved in the world
Thou wilt become dear in men's hearts as their own soul.
Do not withhold humility from mankind,
For thus thou mayest withdraw thy neck (from perplexity) as it were a sword (from the scabbard). <span id="p36"><sup><small>[ p. 36 ]</small></sup></span>
Humility on the part of the exalted is commendable.
If a beggar be humble, it is his nature.

<span id="s8"></span>

## IN CONDEMNATION OF PRIDE

Beware, O son! that thou dost not become proud,
Lest fortune thereby slip from thine hands.
Pride on the part of a wise man is not comely;
Sad is such demeanour in the case of a prudent person.
Pride is the habit of the ignorant,
Pride doth not proceed from men of intelligence.
Pride caused the fall of Azazil, [^7]
And led to his being ensnared in the prison of the accursed.
Whoever is by nature arrogant, <span id="p37"><sup><small>[ p. 37 ]</small></sup></span>
His head is filled with pride beyond imagination.
Pride is the source of adversity,
Pride is the nature of the evil-disposed.
Since thou knowest about pride, why dost thou pursue it?
If thou actest thus, thou doest wrong.

<span id="s9"></span>

## ON THE EXCELLENCE OF LEARNING

Sons of Adam from learning will find perfection—
Not from dignity, and rank, and wealth, and property.
Like a taper one must melt in pursuit of learning,
Since without learning one cannot know God.
A man of wisdom is a student of learning,
For the market of wisdom is always brisk.
Whoever is fortunate as regards Eternity,
Maketh choice of the pursuit of knowledge. <span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span>
This pursuit of knowledge is a duty on thy part,
Even if it be necessary to traverse the earth.
Go, seize fast hold of the skirt of knowledge,
For learning will convey thee to everlasting abodes.
Seek nought but knowledge if thou art wise,
For it is neglectful to remain without wisdom.
From learning there will come to thee perfection as regards religion and the world,
For thine affairs will be settled by knowledge.

<span id="s10"></span>

## AS REGARDS AVOIDING THE SOCIETY OF THE IGNORANT

O soul! if thou art wise and intelligent,
Make not choice of the society of the ignorant. <span id="p39"><sup><small>[ p. 39 ]</small></sup></span>
Dart from the ignorant, as it were an arrow;
Mix not with them, as it were sugar and milk.
If thou hast a dragon for a friend in the cave,
It is better than to have an ignorant associate.
If the enemy of thy soul be intelligent,
It is better than an ignorant friend.
From the ignorant proceed nought but bad deeds,
And no one hath heard therefrom but base words.
No one in the world is so despicable as the ignorant,
For nothing is more worthless than ignorance.
The end of the ignorant will be the abode of the lost,
For the ignorant seldom end life well. <span id="p40"><sup><small>[ p. 40 ]</small></sup></span>
It is best that the ignorant should be abased,
For it is fitting that the ignorant should find disgrace.
It is well to shun the ignorant,
For from them will arise disgrace in this world and the next.

<span id="s11"></span>

## DESCRIPTION OF JUSTICE

Since God hath given thee all things to thy desire,
Why dost thou not eventually bring forth the fruits of justice?
Since justice is the adornment of royalty,
Why dost thou not fix thine heart upon justice?
Thy kingdom will be established
If justice cometh to thine aid.
Since Nushirwan [^8] made choice of justice <span id="p41"><sup><small>[ p. 41 ]</small></sup></span>
His name is now held in remembrance for his goodness.
Peace befalleth the kingdom from the effects of justice,
Since from justice the kingdom attaineth its wishes.
There is no better architect in the world than justice,
Since nought is more excellent than righteousness.
Make the world populous through justice;
Fill the hearts of mankind with delight through justice.
What will be the end thereof to thee?
Even this, that thou wilt have the name of a righteous monarch.
Dost thou wish a token of good fortune?
Close the door of oppression against mankind;
Withhold not thy favour from thy subjects;
Gratify the desires of those who seek justice.

<span id="p42"><sup><small>[ p. 42 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="s12"></span>

## IN CONDEMNATION OF OPPRESSION

The world witnesseth desolation owing to failure of justice,
As it were a beautiful garden from the autumn gale.
Do not give way to oppression in any case,
Lest the sun of monarchy suffer decline.
He who raiseth the fire of oppression in the world
Occasioneth a sigh on the part of the people of the land.
If a tyrant raiseth a sigh from the soul
The anguish createth a flame over land and water.
Do not oppress poor helpless people,
Without further thought as to the narrowness of the grave.
Be not disposed towards the market-place of oppression; <span id="p43"><sup><small>[ p. 43 ]</small></sup></span>
Be not neglectful of the smoke of men's hearts.
O man of haste! be not an oppressor of humanity,
For of a sudden the wrath of God will overtake thee.
Do not oppress the poor humble people,
For without doubt the tyrant passeth to perdition.

<span id="s13"></span>

## DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTMENT

O soul! if thou acquirest contentment,
Thou wilt exercise sway in the kingdom of repose.
If thou art pinched with the trials of poverty,
Then, in the estimation of the wise, wealth is nought.
The poor man is not disgraced by poverty,
For mankind attain glory from penury. <span id="p44"><sup><small>[ p. 44 ]</small></sup></span>
Gold and silver are the glory of the rich,
But the poor have inward repose.
Be not distressed if thou art not wealthy,
Since a sovereign cannot extract taxes from the desolate.
In all circumstances contentment is preferable.
Whoever is born under a lucky star is happy.
Enlighten thy soul with the radiance of contentment,
If thou hast any token of good fortune.

<span id="s14"></span>

## IN CONDEMNATION OF AVARICE

Beware! thou that art snared in the net of avarice,
Lest thou be mad and intoxicated with the cup of greed.
Waste not thy life in the acquisition of wealth, <span id="p45"><sup><small>[ p. 45 ]</small></sup></span>
Since an earthen pot is not of the same value as a pearl.
Whosoever hath fallen into the snare of greed
Giveth the harvest of his life to the winds.
I grant that all the wealth of Korah [^9] is thine—
That all the riches of the habitable globe are with thee
But in the end thou wilt be enveloped in the earth,
Like the helpless, with distress of heart.
Why dost thou distress thyself with the anguish of gold?
Why dost thou bear the burden of distress, as if thou wert an ass?
Why dost thou undergo anguish on account of wealth,
For it will of a sudden be swept away. <span id="p46"><sup><small>[ p. 46 ]</small></sup></span>
Hast thou thus given thine heart to the picture of money?
For with the taste thereof thou wilt become a penitent boon companion.
Thou art become such a lover of the face of gold,
That thine affairs are distressed and thy head upset.
Thou art become as it were a prey to its pursuit,
That thou thinkest not of the day of judgment.
Let not the heart of that base wretch rejoice,
Who on account of the world scattereth faith to the winds.

<span id="s15"></span>

## DESCRIPTION OF OBEDIENCE AND WORSHIP

When fortune is a person's slave
His heart is perpetually disposed towards obedience. <span id="p47"><sup><small>[ p. 47 ]</small></sup></span>
It is not fit to turn aside one's head from servitude,
Since fortune is obtainable from obedience.
Happiness is procured from obedience;
The heart becometh illumined from the light of obedience.
If thou girdest thy loins with submission,
Thou wilt open the door of everlasting happiness.
The wise man doth not turn his head from obedience,
Since no excellence is more lofty than obedience.
Keep thine ablutions freshened with the waters of obedience,
So that to-morrow thou mayest be free as from fire.
i Stablish thy prayers with sincerity,
So that thou mayest attain everlasting prosperity. <span id="p48"><sup><small>[ p. 48 ]</small></sup></span>
Enlightenment of soul springeth from obedience,
Just as the earth deriveth light from the sun.
Worship the Creator;
Sit down in the portals of obedience.
If thou makest choice to worship the Creator,
Thou wilt be a chieftain in the kingdom of fortune.
Raise thy head and keep not abstinence in thy pocket,
For Paradise is the abode of the abstinent.
Lighten the lamp of thy soul with piety,
That thou mayest become happy, like the prosperous.
Whoever is clad with the garment of religion
Hath no fear for the trials of the day of judgment.

<span id="p49"><sup><small>[ p. 49 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="s16"></span>

## IN CONDEMNATION OF SATAN

O soul! whoever is overpowered by Satan,
Is night and day in the snare of sin.
Whoever hath Satan for his ruler,
How can he return to the way of God?
O soul! beware that thou dost not give way to sin,
That to-morrow thou mayest be free as from fire.
A wise man avoideth offence,
As sugar melteth in water.
A man of good disposition doth not commit sin,
Lest he becometh as the light of the sun concealed by the clouds.
Do not give way to thy lusts,
Lest thou be suddenly snatched to perdition.
If thine heart doth not turn aside from sin,
Amongst the lowest of the low will be thine abode. <span id="p50"><sup><small>[ p. 50 ]</small></sup></span>
Do not destroy the house of life
With the torrent of bad and improper actions.
If thou keepest away from sin and iniquity,
Thou wilt not be far from the garden of Paradise.

<span id="s17"></span>

## IN EXPLANATION OF THE WINE OF AFFECTION AND LOVE

O cupbearer! bring wine as it were a garment of fire,
For a man with a soul desires this (religious) intoxication.
The ruby wine in the golden goblet
Is soul-inspiring, as it were a beautiful pearl.
Welcome is the fire of desire to those inspired with love!
Welcome are the delightful pains of the lords of love! <span id="p51"><sup><small>[ p. 51 ]</small></sup></span>
Bring this wine as it were the water of immortality, [^10]
For from its fragrance the soul findeth deliverance from grief!
Happy that soul that desires a Friend! [^11]
Happy that person who is ensnared in the bonds of affection for Him!
Happy that person who is enamoured of the face of the Friend!
Happy that person whose abode is the Nook of the Friend!
A Friend as it were wine like soul-refreshing Peace!
Wine—the purest like a beautiful face!
Happy men of soul who adore wine!
Happy the flavour of wine to men of spirit!

<span id="p52"><sup><small>[ p. 52 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="s18"></span>

## AS TO THE NATURE OF FIDELITY

O soul! be firm footed as regards fidelity,
For money hath no currency without its stamp.
If thou turnest not the rein from the path of fidelity,
Thou wilt be a friend in the hearts of thine enemies.
Turn not thy soul's face from the abode of fidelity,
That thou be not ashamed before the face of thy friends.
Place not thy foot outside the street of fidelity,
Since tyranny is not fitting in the case of friends.
It is wrong to separate thyself from beloved ones;
It is contrary to fidelity to sever thyself from thy comrades. <span id="p53"><sup><small>[ p. 53 ]</small></sup></span>
Want of fidelity is the attribute of women.
Do not learn the unseemly conduct of that sex.

<span id="s19"></span>

## ON THE EXCELLENCE OF GRATITUDE

Whosoever hath a heart filled with gratitude to God,
It is not becoming that he should tie up the tongue of praise.
Teach thy soul nought but gratitude to God,
For it is necessary to praise the Creator.
Thy wealth and possessions are increased by gratitude;
Victory entereth thy door, owing to gratitude.
Wert thou to show gratitude to God till the day of reckoning,
Thou would’st not discharge a thousandth part (of thy duties).
Yes I it is best to lisp thy gratitude, <span id="p54"><sup><small>[ p. 54 ]</small></sup></span>
For gratitude to Him is an ornament to Islam.
If thou restrainest not thy tongue from gratitude to God,
Thou wilt attain everlasting felicity.

<span id="s20"></span>

## IN EXPLANATION OF PATIENCE

If patience is thy helper
Thou wilt attain everlasting happiness.
Patience is the attribute of prophets;
Those who practise religion turn not aside from this direction.
Patience openeth the door of the desires of friends,
For save patience there is no key for them.
Patience giveth thee the desire of thine heart,
For at the hands of mankind thy difficulties are solved.
Patience is best in every case,
For in this sentence is much meaning. <span id="p55"><sup><small>[ p. 55 ]</small></sup></span>
Patience giveth thee thy desire,
It relieveth thee from pain and misfortune.
Patience is the key of the door of thine aspirations,
The enlarger of the kingdom of desire.
Exercise patience if thou art religious,
For haste is the attribute of devils.

<span id="s21"></span>

## DESCRIPTION OF RECTITUDE

O soul! if thou makest choice of rectitude,
Fortune will become to thee an auspicious companion.
A wise man doth not turn aside his head from rectitude,
Since from rectitude a man's name is exalted.
If thou breathest truth at morn
Thou wilt avoid the darkness of ignorance.
Beware that thou breathest nought save rectitude,
Since the right hand holdeth pre-eminence over the left, <span id="p56"><sup><small>[ p. 56 ]</small></sup></span>
Nought is better in the world than rectitude,
For in the rosebud of rectitude there is no thorn.

<span id="s22"></span>

## IN CONDEMNATION OF LYING

When a person followeth after unrighteousness,
Where will he find deliverance on the day of judgment?
Whosoever assumeth the habit of false speaking
Hath no splendour for the lamp of his soul.
Falsehood putteth a man to shame,
Falsehood depriveth a man of dignity.
A wise man blusheth at a liar,
Since no one esteemeth such a person.
O brother! beware that thou speakest not falsely,
For a liar is despised and without repute.
Nought is worse than unrighteousness;
O son! therefrom ariseth loss of fair name.

<span id="p57"><sup><small>[ p. 57 ]</small></sup></span>

<span id="s23"></span>

## ON THE VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE AND DIFFERENCES OF STATION

Regard this globe, resplendent like gold,
The roof of which is firm without pillars!
Regard the curtain of the revolving sphere!
Regard its glittering lamps! [^12]
One is a shepherd, and another a sovereign;
One is a suppliant for justice, another covets a throne;
One is happy, and another miserable;
One is prosperous, and another unfortunate;
One is a payer of taxes, and another sits on a throne;
One is exalted, and another debased;
One sitteth on a mat, and another upon a throne;
One is in rags, and another is clad in silk;
One hath no bread, and another revels in wealth; <span id="p58"><sup><small>[ p. 58 ]</small></sup></span>
One is disappointed, and another prosperous;
One is afflicted, and another rolleth in riches;
One hath a transient fate, and another is established throughout eternity;
One is full of health, and another is sickly;
One is full of years, and another is a mere stripling;
One is filled with righteousness, and another lives in sin;
One is given to prayer, and another is addicted to deceit;
One is upright and religious,
Another is immersed in an ocean of crime and wickedness;
One is of good disposition, and another is of hasty temper;
One is patient, and another is quarrelsome;
One is at ease, another in pain;
One is in difficulties, another is prosperous;
One is a chieftain in the world of luxury, <span id="p59"><sup><small>[ p. 59 ]</small></sup></span>
Another is a captive in the snares of adversity;
One is established in the rose garden of comfort,
Another is associated with anguish, pain, and distress;
One is like a rose resplendent with joy,
Another is distressed at heart, and pained in soul;
One girdeth his loins with obedience,
Another bringeth his life to an end in sin;
One passeth day and night with the Koran in his hands,
Another sleepeth intoxicated in the corner of a wine shop;
One is fixed firm as a peg at the door of religion,
Another is a sinner in the way of infidelity;
One is prosperous, learned, and intelligent,
Another is unfortunate, ignorant, and abashed; <span id="p60"><sup><small>[ p. 60 ]</small></sup></span>
One is a champion, agile, and a warrior,
Another is faint-hearted, indolent, and without courage;
One exceedeth all limits in the possession of wealth,
Another is in want of bread and means for his family;
One hath the taper of joy resplendent,
To another bright daylight is as night.

<span id="s24"></span>

## AGAINST PLACING HOPE IN CREATED BEINGS

For this therefore place no reliance upon fortune,
For it will suddenly deprive thy soul of life.
Put no reliance upon a numberless army,
For it may be that thou wilt not be aided by victory.
Put no reliance upon kingdom, position, and rank, <span id="p61"><sup><small>[ p. 61 ]</small></sup></span>
For they existed before thee, and will remain after thee.
Do not wrong because thou seest wrong on the part of a true friend;
Good fruit doth not grow from bad seed.
Put no reliance on majesty and power,
For suddenly will arrive the command to give up thy soul.
Many are the monarchs of exalted rank;
Many are the warriors who overrun kingdoms;
Many are the fierce warriors who scatter armies;
Many are the lion-like men who smite with the sword;
Many are the moon-faced beauties of graceful figure;
Many are the lovely ones with stature like the sun;
Many are the newly arisen with lovely cheeks; <span id="p62"><sup><small>[ p. 62 ]</small></sup></span>
Many are the freshly decked brides;
Many are the famous, and many are the fortunate;
Many are they like the cypress in stature, and many are the rosy-cheeked beauties
Who have rent the garment of life,
Who have drawn the head within the wall of the grave.
With such the harvest of their life hath been scattered to the winds,
So that never hath any one a trace of them.
Link not thy soul with this earth and its vain delights,
For misfortune may rain upon it from Heaven.
Set not thine heart upon this material abode,
For thou wilt not find therein delight for thy soul.
Place not thine affections upon this ancient and ruined dwelling
For it will not be void of grief and pain. <span id="p63"><sup><small>[ p. 63 ]</small></sup></span>
The world hath no permanence, O my son!
Pass not thy life therein in negligence.
Fix not thy heart upon this perishable abode.
From Sadi receive this one piece of advice.
