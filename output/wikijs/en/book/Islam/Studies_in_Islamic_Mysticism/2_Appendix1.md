Mention has been made ([p. 99](./2_3#p99), note [2](./2_3#fn288) _supra_) of Jílí's ode entitled al-Nawádiru ’l-‘ ayniyya fi ’l-bawádiri ’l-ghaybiyya. In the _Insánu ’l-Kámil_ he cites 36 of its 534 verses (I. 30, 3; 39, 6 fr. foot; 52, 17; 66, 19; and 76, 15) and describes it as a magnificent and unique composition, too sublime to be fully understood. It is, however, little more than a versified summary of matter set forth in the _Insánu ’l-Kámil_, though in some instances the author expresses himself with a freedom and boldness which would hardly be tolerated in a prose treatise. As a poem, apart from its ungraceful style, it suffers from expounding a theory of mystical philosophy and cannot bear comparison with Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ's _Tá’iyya_—the poetry of pure mysticism. The extracts given below have been copied from a manuscript in the British Museum (Or. 3684; Rieu's Suppl. to the Catalogue of Arabic MSS. No. 245) containing the text together with a commentary by ‘Abdu ’l-Ghaní al-Nábulusí.

_v_. ٢. Instead of “there is no god but Allah” the poet says, “there is nothing but Absolute Beauty (_jamál_) and phenomenal beauty (_ḥusn_),” these being the inward and outward aspects of the Beloved.

_vv_. ٧–٦. The individualisations of the Divine Essence are named “the creatures of God,” but in reality they are no other than the Essence itself.

_v_. ١١. K (1. 76, 16): ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14401.jpg).

_v_. ١٣. The MS. and K read ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14402.jpg).

_v_. ١٦. The MS. reads ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14501.jpg) for ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14502.jpg).

_v_. ٢٠. The rhyme in this poem is _muqayyad_. Even Jílí could not have written ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14503.jpg) here, or ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14504.jpg), (4, _v_. ٢٢). He neglects the rule that in this form of Ṭawíl the third foot of the second hemistich should be   ̆  ̄  ̆ (not   ̆  ̄  ̄).

_v_. ١, ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14601.jpg) variant ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14602.jpg).

_v_. ٦. MS. ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14603.jpg). Cf. [p. 123](./2_5#p123) _supra_.

_v_. ٨ foll. The terms “ascent” and “descent” are improperly applied to the spirit, which has its being in God ( ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14604.jpg) in _v_. ١. means ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14605.jpg)). In order to distinguish it from God, we say that it is particularised and individualised, _i.e._ created; and we give the name of “spirit” to this individualisation, by means of which God displays Himself as in a mirror.

_v_. ١٤. ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14606.jpg) is a correction of the MS. reading ![](/image/book/Islam/Studies_in_Islamic_Mysticism/14607.jpg).
