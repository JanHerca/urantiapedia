IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.  
Verily, we have given thee El KâuTHar [^504]; p. 343  
So pray to thy Lord and slaughter (victims).  
Verily, he who hates thee shall be childless [^505].

## Footnotes

[^504]: 342:3 The word signifies ‘abundance.’ It is also the name of a river in Paradise.

[^505]: 343:1 This is directed against Âs ibn Wail, who, when Mohammed's son El Qâsim died, called him abtar, which means ‘docktailed,’ i.e. childless.
