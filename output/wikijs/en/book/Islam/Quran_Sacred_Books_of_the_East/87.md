IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

Celebrated the name of thy Lord most High, who created and fashioned, and who decreed and guided, and who brings forth the pasture, [5] and then makes it dusky stubble!

We will make thee recite, and thou shalt not forget [^479], save what God pleases. Verily, He knows the open and what is concealed; and we will send <span id="p329"><sup><small>[ p. 329 ]</small></sup></span> thee easily to ease; wherefore remind, for, verily, the reminder is useful.

[10] But he who fears will be mindful; but the wretch will avoid it; he who will broil on the great fire, and then therein shall neither die nor live!

Prosperous is he who purifies himself, [15] and remembers the name of his Lord and prays!

Nay! but ye prefer the life of this world, while the, hereafter is better and more lasting.

Verily, this was in the books of yore,—the books of Abraham and Moses.
