[^492].

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.  
READ, in the name of thy Lord!  
Who created man from congealed blood!  
Read, for thy Lord is most generous!  
[5] Who taught the pen!  
Taught man what he did not know!  
Nay, verily, man is indeed outrageous at seeing himself get rich!  
Verily, unto thy Lord is the return!  
Hast thou considered him who forbids [10] a servant [^493] when he prays [^494]?

<span id="p337">[<sup><small>p. 337</small></sup>]</span>

Hast thou considered if he were in guidance or bade piety?  
Hast thou considered if he said it was a lie, and turned his back?  
Did he not know that God can see?  
[15] Nay, surely, if he do not desist we will drag him by the forelock!—the lying sinful forelock!  
So let him call his counsel: we will call the guards of hell!  
Nay, obey him not, but adore and draw nigh!
