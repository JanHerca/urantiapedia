IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.  
By the fig!  
And by the olive!

<span id="p336">[<sup><small>p. 336</small></sup>]</span>

And by Mount Sinai!  
And by this safe land [^491]!  
We have indeed created man in the best of symmetry. [5] Then we will send him back the lowest of the low; save those who believe and act aright; for theirs is a hire that is not grudged.  
But what shall make thee call the judgment after this a lie!  
Is not God a most just of judges?
