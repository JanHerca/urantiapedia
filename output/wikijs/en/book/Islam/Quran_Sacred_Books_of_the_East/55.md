IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.  
The Merciful taught the Qur’ân;  
He created man, taught him plain speech.  
The sun and the moon have their appointed time;  
[5] The herbs and the trees adore;  
And the heavens, He raised them and set the balance,  
  that ye should not be outrageous in the balance;  
But weigh ye aright, and stint not the balance.  
And the earth He has set it for living creatures;  
  [10] therein are fruits and palms, with sheaths;  
  and grain with chaff and frequent shoots;  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
He created men of crackling clay like the potters.  
  And He created the _g_inn from smokeless fire.  
[15] Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
The Lord of the two easts [^362] and the Lord of the two wests!

<span id="p259">[<sup><small>p. 259</small></sup>]</span>

Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
He has let loose the two seas that meet together;  
  [20] between them is a barrier they cannot pass!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
He brings forth from each pearls both large and small!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
His are the ships which rear aloft in the sea like mountains.  
[25] Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Every one upon it [^363] is transient, but the face of thy  
  Lord endowed with majesty and honour shall endure.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Of Him whosoever is in the heaven and the earth  
  does beg; every day He is in (some fresh) business!  
[30] Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
We shall be at leisure for you, O ye two weighty ones [^364]!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
O assembly of _g_inns and mankind! if ye are able  
  to pass through the confines of heaven and earth

<span id="p260">[<sup><small>p. 260</small></sup>]</span>

then pass through them!—ye cannot pass through  
  save by authority!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
[35] There shall be sent against you a flash of fire,  
  and molten copper, and ye shall not be helped!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
And when the heaven is rent asunder and become  
  rosy red [^365]\—(melting) like grease!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
On that day neither man nor _g_inn shall be asked about his crime!  
[40] Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
The sinners shall be known by their marks, and  
  shall be seized by the forelock and the feet!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
‘This is hell, which the sinners did call a lie! they  
  shall circulate between it and water boiling quite!'  
[45] Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
But for him who fears the station of his Lord are gardens twain!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Both furnished with branching trees.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
[50] In each are flowing springs.

<span id="p261">[<sup><small>p. 261</small></sup>]</span>

Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
In each are, of every fruit, two kinds.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Reclining on beds the linings of which are of brocade,  
  and the fruit of the two gardens within reach to cull.  
[55] Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Therein are maids of modest glances whom no man  
  nor _g_inn has deflowered before.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
As though they were rubies and pearls.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
[60] Is the reward of goodness aught but goodness?  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
And besides these, are gardens twain [^366],  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
With dark green foliage.  
[65] Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye . twain deny?  
In each two gushing springs.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
In each fruit and palms and pomegranates.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?

<span id="p262">[<sup><small>p. 262</small></sup>]</span>

[70] In them maidens best and fairest!  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Bright and large-eyed maids kept in their tents.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Whom no man nor _g_inn has deflowered before them.  
[75] Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Reclining. on green cushions and beautiful carpets.  
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny?  
Blessed be the name of thy Lord possessed of majesty and honour!
