IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

By the heaven and by the night star! And what <span id="p328">[<sup><small>p. 328</small></sup>]</span> shall make thee know what the night star is?—The star of piercing brightness.

Verily, every soul has a guardian over it.

[5] Then let man look from what he is created: he is created from water poured forth, that comes out from between the loins and the breast bones [^478].

Verily, He is able to send him back again, on the day when the secrets shall be tried, [10] and he shall have no strength nor helper.

By the heaven that sends back the rain!

And the earth with its sprouting!

Verily, it is indeed a distinguishing speech, and it is no frivolity!

[15] Verily, they do plot a plot!

But I plot my plot too! let the misbelievers bide; do thou then let them bide awhile!
