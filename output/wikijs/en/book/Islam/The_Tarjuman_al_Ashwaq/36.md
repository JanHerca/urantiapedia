## XXXVI

1\. O earth of the Highland, mayst thou be a blessed highland! May the rain-clouds water thee abundantly with shower on shower!

<span id="p121">[<sup><small>p. 121</small></sup>]</span>

2\. And may he who has greeted thee for fifty years greet thee once and twice and then once again!

3\. I crossed every desert and wilderness to meet her, riding on the big-humped she-camel and the old dromedary,

4\. Until the lightning shone from the direction of al-Ghaḍá, and its coming in the night has increased the passion that I felt before.
