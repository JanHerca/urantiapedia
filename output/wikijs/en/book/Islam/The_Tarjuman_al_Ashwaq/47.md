## XLVII

1\. O dove on the _bán_ tree at Dhát al-Ghaḍá, I am oppressed by the burden thou hast laid upon me.

2\. Who can support the anguish of love? Who can drain the bitter draught of destiny?

3\. I say in my grief and burning passion, ‘O would that he who caused my sickness had tended me when I am sick!’

4\. He passed by the house-door mocking, hiding himself, veiling his head and turning away.

5\. His veiling did me no hurt; I was only hurt by his having turned away from me.

## COMMENTARY

1\. ‘O dove,’ i.e. the Absolute Wisdom.

‘Dhát al-Ghaḍá,’ referring to states of self-mortification.

‘The burden’: cf. Kor. xxxiii, 72.

4\. ‘He passed,’ etc., referring to Divine thoughts which flash upon the mind and are gone in a moment.

5\. i.e. I am necessarily veiled from God, but God's turning away from me is caused by some quality in me of which I am ignorant and which I cannot remove until God enables me to know what it is.
