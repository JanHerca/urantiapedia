## XLIII

1\. Let me never forget my abode at Wána and my saying to camel-riders as they departed and arrived,

2\. ‘Stay beside us a while that we may be comforted thereby, for I swear by those whom I love that I am consoled (by thinking of you).’

3\. If they set out they will journey with the most auspicious omen, and if they halt they will alight at the most bountiful halting-place.

4\. ’Twas in the glen of the valley of Qanát I met them, and my last sight of them was between an-Naqá and al-Mushalshal.

5\. They watch every place where the camels find pasturage, but they pay no heed to the heart of a lover led astray.

6\. O camel-driver, have pity on a youth whom you see breaking colocynth when he bids farewell,

7\. Laying his palms crosswise on his bosom to still a heart that throbbed at the noise of the (moving) howdah.

8\. They say, ‘Patience!’ but grief is not patient. What can I do, since patience is far from me?

9\. Even if I had patience and were ruled by it, my soul would not be patient. How, therefore, when I have it not?

## COMMENTARY

1\. ‘Wána,’ i.e.. the station of confession and shortcoming and failure to pay due reverence to the majesty of the Divine presence.

‘Camel-riders,’ i.e. the saints and favourites of God (###).

5\. ‘Every place where the camels find pasturage,’ i.e. the objects to which our aspirations tend.

6\. ‘O camel-driver’: he addresses the Divine voice which calls the aspirations towards it.

7\. ‘Breaking colocynth,’ i.e. having his face distorted with anguish (for when colocynth is broken its pungent smell <span id="p130">[<sup><small>p. 130</small></sup>]</span> causes the eyes to water). Imru’u ’l-Qays says (cf. Ahlwardt, _The Díwáns_, 204, No. 26): ###
