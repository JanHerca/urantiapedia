## L

1\. Oh, the traitress! She has left bitten by her viper-like locks one who would fain approach her,

2\. And she bends her soft eye and melts him and leaves him sick on his bed.

3\. She shot the arrows of her glances from the bow of an eyebrow, and on whatever side I came I was killed.

## COMMENTARY

1\. ‘The traitress,’ i.e. a deceitful Attribute, which caused one who sought her to become enamoured of the mysterious sciences derived from the Divine majesty and beauty.

2\. ‘His bed,’ i.e. his body.

3\. He describes the ‘passing away’ produced by contemplation of the Divine Ideas.
