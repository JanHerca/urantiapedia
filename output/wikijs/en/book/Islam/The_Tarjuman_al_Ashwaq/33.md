## XXXIII

1\. I respond with diverse notes of grief to every cooing dove perched upon a bough in a grove.

2\. She weeps for her mate without tears, but from my eyelids the tears of sorrow are streaming.

3\. I say to her, when my eyelids have shed their abundant tears in token of my inward state,

4\. ‘Hast thou any knowledge of those whom I love, and did they rest at midday in the shadows of the branches?’

## COMMENTARY

1\. ‘Every cooing dove,’ i.e. subtle spiritual essences which appear in forms of the intermediate world.

2\. ‘From my eyelids,’ etc.: because of my bodily existence.

4\. ‘Did they rest,’ etc., i.e. did they show themselves in the shades of this natural organism, so that I may seek them there?
