## LX

1\. Approach the dwelling of dear ones who have taken covenants—may clouds of incessant rain pour upon it!—

2\. And breathe the scent of the wind over against their land, in desire that the (sweet) airs may tell thee where they are.

3\. I know that they encamped at the _bán_ tree of Iḍam, where the _‘arár_ plants grow and the _shíḥ_ and the _katam_.

## COMMENTARY

‘Covenants,’ i.e. the Divine covenants taken from the spirits of the prophets.

‘Clouds of incessant rain,’ i.e. knowledge descending upon them continuously.

2\. ‘And breathe,’ etc., referring to the Tradition, ‘I feel the breath of the Merciful from the quarter of Yemen.’
