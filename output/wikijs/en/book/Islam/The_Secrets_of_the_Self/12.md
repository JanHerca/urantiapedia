_Story of the bird that was faint with thirst_.

<span id="v1145"><sup><small>1145</small></sup></span>  A bird was faint with thirst,
The breath in his body was heaving like waves of smoke.
He saw a diamond in the garden:
Thirst created a vision of water.
Deceived by the sunbright stone
<span id="v1150"><sup><small>1150</small></sup></span>  The foolish bird fancied that it was water.
He got no moisture from the gem:
He pecked it with his beak, but it did not wet his palate.
“O thrall of vain desire," said the diamond,

<span id="p101">[<sup><small>p. 101</small></sup>]</span>

“Thou hast sharpened thy greedy beak on me;
<span id="v1155"><sup><small>1155</small></sup></span>  But I am not a dewdrop, I give no drink,
I do not live for the sake of others.
Wouldst thou hurt me? Thou art mad!
A life that reveals the Self is strange to thee.
My water will shiver the beaks of birds
<span id="v1160"><sup><small>1160</small></sup></span>  And break the jewel of man's life." [^86]
The bird won not his heart's wish from the diamond
And turned away from the sparkling stone.
Disappointment swelled in his breast,
The song in his throat became a wail.
<span id="v1165"><sup><small>1165</small></sup></span>  Upon a rose-twig a drop of dew
Gleamed like the tear in a nightingale's eye:
All its glitter was owing to the sun,
It was trembling in fear of the sun

<span id="p102">[<sup><small>p. 102</small></sup>]</span>

A restless sky-born star
<span id="v1170"><sup><small>1170</small></sup></span>  That had stopped for a moment, from desire to be seen;
Oft deceived by bud and flower,
It had gained nothing from Life.
There it hung, ready to drop,
Like a tear on the eyelashes of a lover who hath lost his heart.
<span id="v1175"><sup><small>1175</small></sup></span>  The sorely distressed bird hopped under the rose-bush,
The dewdrop trickled into his mouth.
O thou that wouldst deliver thy soul from enemies,
I ask thee—"Art thou a drop of water or a gem?”
When the bird melted in the fire of thirst,
<span id="v1190"><sup><small>1190</small></sup></span>  It appropriated the life of another.
The drop was not solid and gem-like;
The diamond had a being, the drop had none.
Never for an instant neglect Self-preservation:

<span id="p103">[<sup><small>p. 103</small></sup>]</span>

Be a diamond, not a dewdrop!
<span id="v1185"><sup><small>1185</small></sup></span>  Be massive in nature, like mountains,
And bear on thy crest a hundred clouds laden with floods of rain!
Save thyself by affirmation of Self,
Compress thy quicksilver into silver ore!
Produce a melody from the string of Self,
<span id="v1190"><sup><small>1190</small></sup></span>  Make manifest the secrets of Self!
