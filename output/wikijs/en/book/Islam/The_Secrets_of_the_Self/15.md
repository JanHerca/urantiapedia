_Showing that the purpose of the Moslem's life is to exalt the Word of Allah, and that the Jihád (war against unbelievers), if it be prompted by land-hunger, is unlawful in the religion of Islam_.

Imbue thine heart with the tincture of Allah,
<span id="v1320"><sup><small>1320</small></sup></span>  Give honour and glory to Love!
The Moslem's nature prevails by means of love:
The Moslem, if he be not loving, is an infidel.
Upon God depends his seeing and not- seeing,
His eating, drinking, and sleeping.

<span id="p117">[<sup><small>p. 117</small></sup>]</span>

In his will that which God wills becomes lost—1325
How shall a man believe this saying?" [^91]
He encamps in the field of “There is no god but Allah”;
In the world he is a witness against mankind.
His high estate is attested by the Prophet that was sent to men and Jinn—
<span id="v1330"><sup><small>1330</small></sup></span>  By the most truthful of witnesses.
Leave words and seek that spiritual state,
Shed the light of God o’er the darkness of works!
Albeit clad in kingly robe, live as a dervish,
Live wakeful and meditating on God!
<span id="v1335"><sup><small>1335</small></sup></span>  Whatever thou doest, let it be thine aim therein to draw nigh to God,
That His glory may be made manifest by thee.

<span id="p118">[<sup><small>p. 118</small></sup>]</span>

Peace becomes an evil, if its object be aught else;
War is good if its object is God.
If God be not exalted by our swords,
<span id="v1340"><sup><small>1340</small></sup></span>  War dishonours the people.
The holy Sheikh Miyán Mír Walí, [^92]
By the light of whose soul every hidden thing was revealed
His feet were firmly planted on the path of Mohammed,
He was a flute for the impassioned music of love.
<span id="v1345"><sup><small>1345</small></sup></span>  His tomb keeps our city safe from harm
And causes the beams of true religion to shine on us.
Heaven stooped its brow to his threshold,
The Emperor of India was one of his disciples. [^93]
Now, this monarch had sown the seed of ambition in his heart
<span id="v1350"><sup><small>1350</small></sup></span>  And was resolved on conquest.

<span id="p119">[<sup><small>p. 119</small></sup>]</span>

The flames of vain desire were alight in him,
He was teaching his sword to ask, “Is there any more?” [^94]
In the Deccan was a great noise of war,
His army stood on the battlefield.
<span id="v1355"><sup><small>1355</small></sup></span>  He went to the Sheikh of heaven-high dignity
That he might receive his blessing:
The Moslem turns from this world to God
And strengthens policy with prayer.
The Sheikh made no answer to the Emperor's speech,
<span id="v1360"><sup><small>1360</small></sup></span>  The assembly of dervishes was all ears,
Until a disciple, in his hand a silver coin,
Opened his lips and broke the silence,
Saying, "Accept this poor offering from me,
O guide of them that have lost the way to God!

<span id="p120">[<sup><small>p. 120</small></sup>]</span>

<span id="v1365"><sup><small>1365</small></sup></span>  My limbs were bathed in sweat of labour
Before I put away a dirhem in my skirt.”
The Sheikh said: "This money ought to be given to our Sultan,
Who is a beggar wearing the raiment of a king.
Though he holds sway over sun, moon, and stars,
<span id="v1370"><sup><small>1370</small></sup></span>  Our Emperor is the most penniless of mankind.
His eye is fixed on the table of strangers,
The fire of his hunger hath consumed a whole world.
His sword is followed by famine and plague,
His culture lays a wide land waste.
<span id="v1375"><sup><small>1375</small></sup></span>  The folk are crying out because of his indigence,
His empty-headedness, and his oppression of the weak.
His power is an enemy to all:

<span id="p121">[<sup><small>p. 121</small></sup>]</span>

Humankind are the caravan and he the brigand.
In his self-delusion and ignorance
<span id="v1380"><sup><small>1380</small></sup></span>  He calls pillage by the name of empire.
Both the royal troops and those of the enemy
Are cloven in twain by the sword of his hunger.
The beggar's hunger consumes his own soul,
But the sultan's hunger destroys state and religion.
<span id="v1385"><sup><small>1385</small></sup></span>  Whoso shall draw the sword for anything except Allah,
His sword is sheathed in his own breast.”
