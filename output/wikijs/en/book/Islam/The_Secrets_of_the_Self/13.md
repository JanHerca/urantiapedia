_Story of the diamond and the coal_.

Now I will open one more gate of Truth,
I will tell thee another tale.
The coal in the mine said to the diamond,
“O thou entrusted with splendours everlasting,
<span id="v1195"><sup><small>1195</small></sup></span>  We are comrades, and our being is one;
The source of our existence is the same,
Yet while I die here in the anguish of worthlessness,
Thou art set on the crowns of emperors.

<span id="p105">[<sup><small>p. 105</small></sup>]</span>

My stuff is so vile that I am valued less than earth,
<span id="v1200"><sup><small>1200</small></sup></span>  Whereas the mirror's heart is rent by thy beauty.
My darkness illumines the chafing-dish,
Then my substance is incinerated at last.
Every one puts the sole of his foot on my head
And covers my stock of existence with ashes.
<span id="v1205"><sup><small>1205</small></sup></span>  My fate must needs be deplored;
Dost thou know what is the gist of my being?
Thou art a condensed wavelet of smoke,
Endowed with the properties of a single spark;
Both in feature and nature thou art star-like,
<span id="v1210"><sup><small>1210</small></sup></span>  Splendours rise from every side of thee.
Now thou becom’st the light of a monarch's eye,

<span id="p106">[<sup><small>p. 106</small></sup>]</span>

Now thou adornest the haft of a dagger.”
“O sagacious friend!" said the diamond,
Dark earth, when hardened, becomes in dignity as a bezel.
<span id="v1215"><sup><small>1215</small></sup></span>  Having been at strife with its environment,
It is ripened by the struggle and grows hard like a stone.
’Tis this ripeness that has endowed my form with light
And filled my bosom with radiance.
Because thy being is immature, thou hast become abased;
<span id="v1220"><sup><small>1220</small></sup></span>  Because thy body is soft, thou art burnt.
Be void of fear, grief, and anxiety;
Be hard as a stone, be a diamond!
Whosoever strives hard and grips tight,
The two worlds are illumined by him.
<span id="v1225"><sup><small>1225</small></sup></span>  A little earth is the origin of the Black Stone

<span id="p107">[<sup><small>p. 107</small></sup>]</span>

Which puts forth its head in the Ka‘ba:
Its rank is higher than Sinai,
It is kissed by the swarthy and the fair.
In solidity consists the glory of Life;
<span id="v1230"><sup><small>1230</small></sup></span>  Weakness is worthlessness and immaturity."
