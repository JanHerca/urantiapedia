## Footnotes

[^1]: 74:1 Tholuck in his SUFISMUS (Berolini, MDCCCXXI), p. 105, explains this as follows: “_Cincinnorum circuli_, Sic divina dicunt mysteria, nemini præter Deum ipsum nota.” This, however, is the interpretation of _zulf_ (tresses), not _khan i zulf_. The verse quoted above, in page [41](./omy15.htm#p41),

“One glimpse I gave them of my glorious face,”

affords a good illustration of this. The words of the original being

![](/image/book/Islam/Oriental_Mysticism/07400.jpg)

“I showed them a hair's point of my _tresses_ (_zulf_).”

[^2]: 79:1 Cf. the answer of the Delphic oracle to Crœsus, Herod. I. 47. 4:

καὶ κωφοῦ συνίημι, καὶ οὐ φωνεῦντος ἀκούω.
