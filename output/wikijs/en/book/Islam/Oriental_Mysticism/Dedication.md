TRANSLATION.

SIRE,

From a feeling of profound admiration for the munificent encouragement given to Oriental studies throughout YOUR MAJESTY'S Empire, I have solicited the honour of dedicating to YOUR MAJESTY this attempt to contribute towards a better understanding of the Philosopher Poets of the East. The noble Institutions of France for the promotion of

those studies (some of which it has been my privilege to attend), and the Illustrious Names that adorn them, will make YOUR MAJESTY'S reign long remembered as the brightest Era in European Orientalism.

<p style="text-align:center;">
I have the honour to remain,<br>
<br>
SIRE,<br>
<br>
YOUR MAJESTY'S<br>
<br>
most obedient and humble Servant,<br>
</p>

E. H. PALMER.
