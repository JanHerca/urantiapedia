_All references given without an indication of the name are to the Holy Qur'ān, the first figure representing the number of the chapter and the second the number of the verse._

_Words uttered by the Holy Prophet are throughout given within inverted commas._

In the references to Hadīth collections, the first number represents the number of the book and the second the number of the chapter, except in the case of the _Musnad_ of Ahmad ibn Hanbal where the first figure stands for the volume and the second for the page. In all references to the _Mishkāt_, the name of the collection from which the _Mishkāt_ has taken the particular hadīth is also indicated.
