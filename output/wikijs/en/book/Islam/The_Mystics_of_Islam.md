This text is in the public domain in the US. Original pagination has been retained; footnotes have been embedded into the text within braces and in a smaller font({_i.e._}). Characters with diacritics have been mapped to the closest ASCII character (_e.g._ Sûfî is transliterated Sufi). Greek letters have also been eliminated, and (the two) words in Greek in the original are enclosed in French quotes («»). All references to the 'Koran' in the text have been linked to the [Pickthall English Version of the Qur'an](/en/book/Islam/Quran) at this site. Many of the verse references given by Nicholson are one or two off from Pickthall and other translations; the hyperlinks have been adjusted but the original citation retained in these instances.\]
