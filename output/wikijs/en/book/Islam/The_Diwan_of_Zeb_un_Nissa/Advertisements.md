## THE WISDOM OF THE EAST SERIES

**Edited by L. CRANMER-BYNG and Dr. S. A. KAPADIA**

### THE SERIES AND ITS PURPOSE

The object of the Editors of this Series is a very definite one. They desire above all things that, in their humble way, these books shall be the ambassadors of good-will and understanding between East and West—the old world of Thought and the new of Action. In this endeavour, and in their own sphere, they are but followers of the highest example in the land. They are confident that a deeper knowledge of the great ideals and lofty philosophy of Oriental thought may help to a revival of that true spirit of Charity which neither despises nor fears the nations of another creed and colour.
