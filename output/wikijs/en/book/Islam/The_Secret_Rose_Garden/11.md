## THE GAMBLE OF THE SELF

REAL prayer can only be yours
When you have staked and gambled yourself away
And your essence is pure.
Then “a joy of the eyes” are your prayers
And no separation remains,
For knower and known are one and the same.

## TRANSCEND SELF

RISE above time and space,
Pass by the world, and be to yourself your own world.

<span id="p77">[<sup><small>p. 77</small></sup>]</span>

## SELFLESSNESS

IN the empty heart, void of self
Can be heard the echoing cry,
“I am the Truth.”
Thus is man one with the Eternal,
Travelling, travel and traveller have become one.
