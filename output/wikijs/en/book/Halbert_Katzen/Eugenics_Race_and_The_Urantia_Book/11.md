Author: **Halbert Katzen J.D.**

Genetic diversity has a direct impact on the quality of life. From the micro level of the family to the macro level of humanity, genetic variations make a difference. This spectrum involves variations in quality both in terms of whether one has a specific trait as well as how powerfully a trait manifests. As discussed in the initial chapters, the designation of such traits as being relatively superior or inferior does not mean that the person is superior or inferior, any more or less a member of the human family, any less deserving of love.

[Chapter 6](/en/book/Halbert_Katzen/Eugenics_Race_and_The_Urantia_Book/6) reviewed statements in *The Urantia Book* that characterize the secondary Sangik races as inferior relative to the primary Sangik races. The discussion in [Chapter 7](/en/book/Halbert_Katzen/Eugenics_Race_and_The_Urantia_Book/7) clarified that the “subnormal” classification does not refer to the secondary Sangik races. This chapter focuses on the differences between the colored races as they originally existed and as they exist today. It also reviews some of the ways the authors emphasize that the indigo (black) race is not subnormal.

In order to provide context for this chapter, some of the quotes from [Chapter 5](/en/book/Halbert_Katzen/Eugenics_Race_and_The_Urantia_Book/5): History and Destiny are re-presented. One of the advantages of doing an historical review of humanity’s eugenics issues is that it allows us to see how our attitude about and desire for certain types of terminology shifts as we move forward from the ancient past to the present.

Here is how *The Urantia Book* depicts humanity’s early eugenics issues:

> These Andonites avoided the forests in contrast with the habits of their nonhuman relatives. In the forests man has always deteriorated; human evolution has made progress only in the open and in the higher latitudes. The cold and hunger of the open lands stimulate action, invention, and resourcefulness. While these Andonic tribes were developing the pioneers of the present human race amidst the hardships and privations of these rugged northern climes, their backward cousins were luxuriating in the southern tropical forests of the land of their early common origin.
> 
> . . .
> 
> *950,000* years ago the descendants of Andon and Fonta had migrated far to the east and to the west. To the west they passed over Europe to France and England. In later times they penetrated eastward as far as Java, where their bones were so recently found—the so-called Java man—and then journeyed on to Tasmania.
> 
> The groups going west became less contaminated with the backward stocks of mutual ancestral origin than those going east, who mingled so freely with their retarded animal cousins. These unprogressive individuals drifted southward and presently mated with the inferior tribes. Later on, increasing numbers of their mongrel descendants returned to the north to mate with the rapidly expanding Andonic peoples, and such unfortunate unions unfailingly deteriorated the superior stock. Fewer and fewer of the primitive settlements maintained the worship of the Breath Giver. This early dawn civilization was threatened with extinction.
> 
> And thus it has ever been on Urantia. Civilizations of great promise have successively deteriorated and have finally been extinguished by the folly of allowing the superior freely to procreate with the inferior. [^1]

*The Urantia Book* asserts that mating between humans and subhumans was possible during the early part of our evolutionary development. [^2] Given this framework, the logical implications follow from it. Stimulating environments require more “action, invention, and resourcefulness.” Less progressive individuals will “drift” toward an easier environment. This creates a naturenurture feedback loop, encouraging progressive and retrogressive tendencies to become more pronounced over time.

Notice how comfortable it is to use words like “unprogressive,” “deteriorated,” “inferior,” and “backward,” when discussing whether the very earliest human beings were contaminating themselves with their subhuman “retarded animal cousins.”

The depiction of primitive man continues:

> . . . This new religion of fear [of the Andonites] led to attempts to placate the invisible forces behind these natural elements and culminated, later on, in the sacrificing of humans to appease these invisible and unknown physical forces. And this terrible practice of human sacrifice has been perpetuated by the more backward peoples of Urantia right on down to the twentieth century. [^3]
> 
> Human sacrifice has been virtually universal; it persisted in the religious customs of the Chinese, Hindus, Egyptians, Hebrews, Mesopotamians, Greeks, Romans, and many other peoples, even on to recent times among the backward African and Australian tribes. . . . [^4]
> 
> Cannibalism was once well-nigh universal among the evolving races. The Sangiks were all cannibalistic, but originally the Andonites were not, nor were the Nodites and Adamites; neither were the Andites until after they had become grossly admixed with the evolutionary races. [^5]

Cannibalism and religious rituals involving human sacrifice are such excellent examples of the problem with cultural and religious relativism.

Along with cannibalism and human sacrifice, sexual practices are an important measure of cultural advancement. Sexual practices also expose the untenable nature of relativism and the need for clear and unequivocal language when it comes to discussions about civilization. From *The Urantia Book*:

> The story of the evolution of marriage is simply the history of sex control through the pressure of social, religious, and civil restrictions. Nature hardly recognizes individuals; it takes no cognizance of so-called morals; it is only and exclusively interested in the reproduction of the species. Nature compellingly insists on reproduction but indifferently leaves the consequential problems to be solved by society, thus creating an ever-present and major problem for evolutionary mankind. This social conflict consists in the unending war between basic instincts and evolving ethics. [^6]
> 
> . . . In many backward tribes today, the men cook the meat, the women the vegetables, and when the primitive tribes of Australia are on the march, the women never attack game, while a man would not stoop to dig a root. [^7]

The authors of *The Urantia Book* do not romanticize or judge primitive behavior. They recognize it for what it is—as the starting point for the development of civilization. Continuing with its discussion about primitive man’s struggle to maintain forward momentum, *The Urantia Book* states:

> *900,000* years ago the arts of Andon and Fonta and the culture of Onagar were vanishing from the face of the earth; culture, religion, and even flintworking were at their lowest ebb.
> 
> These were the times when large numbers of inferior mongrel groups were arriving in England from southern France. These tribes were so largely mixed with the forest apelike creatures that they were scarcely human. They had no religion but were crude flintworkers and possessed sufficient intelligence to kindle fire.
> 
> They were followed in Europe by a somewhat superior and prolific people, whose descendants soon spread over the entire continent from the ice in the north to the Alps and Mediterranean in the south. These tribes are the so-called *Heidelberg race*.[^8]
> 
> *850,000* years ago the superior Badonan tribes began a warfare of extermination directed against their inferior and animalistic neighbors. In less than one thousand years most of the borderland animal groups of these regions had been either destroyed or driven back to the southern forests. This campaign for the extermination of inferiors brought about a slight improvement in the hill tribes of that age. And the mixed descendants of this improved Badonite stock appeared on the stage of action as an apparently new people—the *Neanderthal race*. [^9]
> 
> *550,000* years ago . . .
> 
> . . . there was so little progress that it truly appeared as though the attempt to produce a new and modified type of intelligent life on Urantia was about to fail. For almost a quarter of a million years these primitive peoples drifted on, hunting and fighting, by spells improving in certain directions, but, on the whole, steadily retrogressing as compared with their superior Andonic ancestors.[^10]

*The Urantia Book*, consistent with the archaeological record, recounts that humanity was not progressing very quickly from one million to five hundred thousand years ago. Apparently, the average quality of humanity’s genetics was not sufficient to support more than a Stone Age-type existence. This assessment is reflected in *The Urantia Book*’s cosmology, which explains that an incarnate celestial government did not appear on this world until the Sangik mutation occurred five hundred thousand years ago. Apparently, this progressive mutation provided the necessary genetic foundation for getting civilization beyond a Stone Age level of development.

Prior to the Sangik races, *The Urantia Book* indicates that humans exhibited a significant tendency to backmate with nonhumans. This, of course, was the primary eugenics issue during that early phase of human evolution. With the appearance of the Sangik races five hundred thousand years ago, the tendency to backmate disappeared. But with this uplift, humanity must confront a new set of challenges. We now need to mature our morals beyond racial bigotry to a standard reflecting true human brotherhood.

According to *The Urantia Book*, with the Sangik mutation came truly civilizable human beings; backmating between Sangiks and the Neanderthalers can now be spoken of as upstepping that race of non civilizable humans. [^11].

> In general and to start with, the Sangik tribes were more intelligent than, and in most ways far superior to, the deteriorated descendants of the early Andonic plainsmen; and the mingling of these Sangik tribes with the Neanderthal peoples led to the immediate improvement of the older race. It was this infusion of Sangik blood, more especially that of the blue man, which produced that marked improvement in the Neanderthal peoples exhibited by the successive waves of increasingly intelligent tribes that swept over Europe from the east. [^12]
> 
> Thus it was that for almost one hundred thousand years these Sangik peoples spread out around the foothills and mingled together more or less, notwithstanding the peculiar but natural antipathy which early manifested itself between the different races.[^13]

In explaining how our planet is one of many mortal worlds, *The Urantia Book* says that on most worlds the colored races do not come all at once and from one mother. Our world is said to be quite unusual in this respect. The next quote comes from a section that speaks more generally about the plan for creating worlds with varying types of diversity, and hence varying characteristics that can only come from using these distinct evolutionary modalities.

> The race of dominance during the early ages of the inhabited worlds is the red man, who ordinarily is the first to attain human levels of development. But while the red man is the senior race of the planets, the succeeding colored peoples begin to make their appearances very early in the age of mortal emergence.
> 
> The earlier races are somewhat superior to the later; the red man stands far above the indigo—black—race. The Life Carriers impart the full bestowal of the living energies to the initial or red race, and each succeeding evolutionary manifestation of a distinct group of mortals represents variation at the expense of the original endowment. Even mortal stature tends to decrease from the red man down to the indigo race, although on Urantia unexpected strains of giantism appeared among the green and orange peoples.
> 
> On those worlds having all six evolutionary races the superior peoples are the first, third, and fifth races—the red, the yellow, and the blue. The evolutionary races thus alternate in capacity for intellectual growth and spiritual development, the second, fourth, and sixth being somewhat less endowed. These secondary races are the peoples that are missing on certain worlds; they are the ones that have been exterminated on many others. It is a misfortune on Urantia that you so largely lost your superior blue men, except as they persist in your amalgamated “white race.” The loss of your orange and green stocks is not of such serious concern. [^14]

An accurate interpretation of the statement, “The loss of your orange and green stocks is not of such serious concern,” requires an appreciation of the broader context.

Using the “Sangik” model to explain human evolution is unique to *The Urantia Book*. That some worlds do not have the secondary Sangik races indicates that from a *Urantia Book* perspective, the secondary Sangiks provide a creative option for the development of a mortal world. It is a good option, to be sure, but *not a necessity* for attaining the fundamental value in creating a variety of early human races.

When the authors say that the loss of the orange and green race is “not of serious concern,” it is not of serious concern *by definition*. In contrast, the loss of a primary Sangik, i.e. the absorption of the blue man into the white races, must be “a misfortune” by definition The context is the general genetic wellbeing of a population; secondary Sangiks, by definition, are provided as a creative addition to the baseline genetic wellbeing of a planet. When the authors make this statement about orange and green stocks, they are addressing a physiological issue, not a moral issue.

By logical extension, of course, there is the implication that the loss of the indigo (black) race would not be of serious concern to the general genetic wellbeing of humanity. By way of analogy, an individual’s general physical health can be maintained even if they are given no musical education and become rather tone deaf. But no one argues in favor of such a thing. And neither is *The Urantia Book* suggesting that the loss of the indigo race would be a good idea or without moral implications. 

There are moral repercussions (not just physiological repercussions) at this stage in the development of modern civilization that did not exist when the orange man and the green man were fighting to extinction—forever depriving humanity of a more robust genetic potential. *The Urantia Book* clearly states that humanity enjoys certain valuable potentials because our world has both primary and secondary Sangik races. The eugenics wisdom in *The Urantia Book* is that we have a moral obligation to future generations to foster and maximize human potentials.

> . . . It often requires ages upon ages to recoup the damage occasioned by the loss of a single superior strain of human heredity. These selected and superior strains of living protoplasm should be jealously and intelligently guarded when once they make their appearance. And on most of the inhabited worlds these superior potentials of life are valued much more highly than on Urantia.[^15]

According to *The Urantia Book*, not only would it be immoral, as well as incorrect, to treat the indigo (black) race as subnormal or subhuman, but also it would be immoral (in relationship to future generations) to waste the unique and valuable genetic qualities that exist in this race.

The assertions of fact made in *The Urantia Book*, peculiar as they may be at times, are interwoven with truths and insights about how to mature and expand our capacity to love each other, to become more civilized, and to create peaceful and harmonious relationships. As the next series of quotes about the colored races unfolds, remember to distinguish the assertions of fact (for example: three races are sufficient and six races is a good option) from the truths and insights that relate to these assertions.

## The red man

> On an average evolutionary planet the six evolutionary races of color appear one by one; the red man is the first to evolve, and for ages he roams the world before the succeeding colored races make their appearance. The simultaneous emergence of all six races on Urantia, *and in one family*, was most unusual.
> 
> . . .
> 
> 1. *The red man*. These peoples were remarkable specimens of the human race, in many ways superior to Andon and Fonta. They were a most intelligent group and were the first of the Sangik children to develop a tribal civilization and government. They were always monogamous; even their mixed descendants seldom practiced plural mating.
> 
> In later times they had serious and prolonged trouble with their yellow brethren in Asia. They were aided by their early invention of the bow and arrow, but they had unfortunately inherited much of the tendency of their ancestors to fight among themselves, and this so weakened them that the yellow tribes were able to drive them off the Asiatic continent.
> 
> . . .
> 
> . . . [I]n a short time after reaching the Americas, . . . there occurred a great decline in intellectual and spiritual culture. Very soon these people again fell to fighting so fiercely among themselves that it appeared that these tribal wars would result in the speedy extinction of this remnant of the comparatively pure red race.
> 
> Because of this great retrogression the red men seemed doomed when . . . Onamonalonton appeared as their leader and spiritual deliverer. He brought temporary peace among the American red men and revived their worship of the “Great Spirit.” Onamonalonton lived to be ninety-six years of age and maintained his headquarters among the great redwood trees of California. Many of his later descendants have come down to modern times among the Blackfoot Indians.
> 
> As time passed, the teachings of Onamonalonton became hazy traditions. Internecine wars were resumed, and never after the days of this great teacher did another leader succeed in bringing universal peace among them. Increasingly the more intelligent strains perished in these tribal struggles; otherwise a great civilization would have been built upon the North American continent by these able and intelligent red men. [^16]

*The Urantia Book* says that the red man practiced monogamy from the beginning and that “the full bestowal of the living energies [is imparted] to the initial or red race, and each succeeding evolutionary manifestation of a distinct race of mortals represents variation at the expense of the original endowment.”[^17] Those are the asserted facts. The truth is that at the tribal stage of development, they never learned to get along with each other, and this destroyed the very best of them. Whether or not one accepts the assertions of fact that are made about the red man, the truth of the teaching can still be appreciated for its emphasis on the importance of getting along peacefully.

The story continues:

> After crossing over to America from China, the northern red man never again came in contact with other world influences (except the Eskimo) until he was later discovered by the white man. It was most unfortunate that the red man almost completely missed his opportunity of being upstepped by the admixture of the later Adamic stock. As it was, the red man could not rule the white man, and he would not willingly serve him. In such a circumstance, if the two races do not blend, one or the other is doomed.[^18]
> 
> The North American Indians never came in contact with even the Andite offspring of Adam and Eve, having been dispossessed of their Asiatic homelands some fifty thousand years before the coming of Adam. . . . [^19]
> 
> When the relatively pure-line remnants of the red race forsook Asia, there were eleven tribes, and they numbered a little over seven thousand men, women, and children. These tribes were accompanied by three small groups of mixed ancestry, the largest of these being a combination of the orange and blue races. These three groups never fully fraternized with the red man and early journeyed southward to Mexico and Central America, where they were later joined by a small group of mixed yellows and reds. These peoples all intermarried and founded a new and amalgamated race, one which was much less warlike than the pure-line red men. Within five thousand years this amalgamated race broke up into three groups, establishing the civilizations respectively of Mexico, Central America, and South America. The South American offshoot did receive a faint touch of the blood of Adam. [^20]

One of the most impressive *UBtheNEWS* reports supports *The Urantia Book*’s recounting of how one hundred thirty-two Andites (descendants of Adam) made it by boat to South America. See the [Adam and Eve Report](/en/article/Halbert_Katzen/Adam_and_Eve).

Working through the color spectrum, the next race to consider would be the now extinct orange man. However, because this aspect of the history in *The Urantia Book*’s does not bear directly on the issues we face today regarding eugenics and racial bigotry, the history and attributes of the orange man are not within the scope of this paper.

## The yellow man

The yellow race, which was early able to achieve intertribal peace, provides a distinct contrast to the red man. *The Urantia Book* says this about the yellow man:

> While the story of India is that of Andite conquest and eventual submergence in the older evolutionary peoples, the narrative of eastern Asia is more properly that of the primary Sangiks, particularly the red man and the yellow man. These two races largely escaped that admixture with the debased Neanderthal strain which so greatly retarded the blue man in Europe, thus preserving the superior potential of the primary Sangik type. [^21]
> 
> The yellow race has continued to occupy the central regions of eastern Asia. Of all the six colored races they have survived in greatest numbers. While the yellow men now and then engaged in racial war, they did not carry on such incessant and relentless wars of extermination as were waged by the red, green, and orange men. These three races virtually destroyed themselves before they were finally all but annihilated by their enemies of other races. [^22]
> 
> 3. *The yellow man*. The primitive yellow tribes were the first to abandon the chase, establish settled communities, and develop a home life based on agriculture. Intellectually they were somewhat inferior to the red man, but socially and collectively they proved themselves superior to all of the Sangik peoples in the matter of fostering racial civilization. Because they developed a fraternal spirit, the various tribes learning to live together in relative peace, they were able to drive the red race before them as they gradually expanded into Asia.
> 
> . . .
> 
> The survival of comparatively large numbers of the yellow race is due to their intertribal peacefulness. From the days of Singlangton to the times of modern China, the yellow race has been numbered among the more peaceful of the nations of Urantia. This race received a small but potent legacy of the later imported Adamic stock. [^23]
> 
> The superiority of the ancient yellow race was due to four great factors:
> 
> 1. *Genetic*. Unlike their blue cousins in Europe, both the red and yellow races had largely escaped mixture with debased human stocks. The northern Chinese, already strengthened by small amounts of the superior red and Andonic strains, were soon to benefit by a considerable influx of Andite blood. The southern Chinese did not fare so well in this regard, and they had long suffered from absorption of the green race, while later on they were to be further weakened by the infiltration of the swarms of inferior peoples crowded out of India by the Dravidian-Andite invasion. And today in China there is a definite difference between the northern and southern races. [^24]
> 
> And so the ancient civilization of the yellow race has persisted down through the centuries. It is almost forty thousand years since the first important advances were made in Chinese culture, and though there have been many retrogressions, the civilization of the sons of Han comes the nearest of all to presenting an unbroken picture of continual progression right on down to the times of the twentieth century. The mechanical and religious developments of the white races have been of a high order, but they have never excelled the Chinese in family loyalty, group ethics, or personal morality.
> 
> This ancient culture has contributed much to human happiness; millions of human beings have lived and died, blessed by its achievements. For centuries this great civilization has rested upon the laurels of the past, but it is even now reawakening to envision anew the transcendent goals of mortal existence, once again to take up the unremitting struggle for never-ending progress. [^25]

With the yellow race, the important lesson that is highlighted, after recognizing that their peacefulness allowed them to flourish, is that cultures reflect families. Families are the true building blocks of society. Here the authors call our attention to an obvious truism about peace. The building blocks of peace are loyalty, ethics, and morality.

As with the orange man, review of the green man is also outside the scope of this paper.

## The blue man

*The Urantia Book* has this to say about the blue man, who contributed much of the genetic foundation of the white races:

> 5. *The blue man*. The blue men were a great people. They early invented the spear and subsequently worked out the rudiments of many of the arts of modern civilization. The blue man had the brain power of the red man associated with the soul and sentiment of the yellow man. The Adamic descendants preferred them to all of the later persisting colored races.[^26]
> 
> 6. *The blue race*. The blue men were scattered all over Europe, but their better centers of culture were situated in the then fertile valleys of the Mediterranean basin and in northwestern Europe. Neanderthal absorption had greatly retarded the culture of the blue man, but he was otherwise the most aggressive, adventurous, and exploratory of all the evolutionary peoples of Eurasia. [^27]
> 
> The early blue men were responsive to the persuasions of the [Lucifer rebellion] and were thrown into great confusion by the subsequent perverted teachings of those traitorous leaders. Like other primitive races they never fully recovered from the turmoil produced by the . . . betrayal, nor did they ever completely overcome their tendency to fight among themselves.
> 
> . . . Orlandof became a great teacher among the blue race and led many of the tribes back to the worship of the true God under the name of the “Supreme Chief.” This was the greatest advance of the blue man until those later times when this race was so greatly upstepped by the admixture of the Adamic stock.
> 
> The European researches and explorations of the Old Stone Age have largely to do with unearthing the tools, bones, and artcraft of these ancient blue men, for they persisted in Europe until recent times. The so-called *white races* of Urantia are the descendants of these blue men as they were first modified by slight mixture with yellow and red, and as they were later greatly upstepped by assimilating the greater portion of the violet race. [^28]
> 
> Social evolution of the co-operative order was initiated by the Dalamatia teachers [the incarnate celestial group that came in response to the Sangik mutation], and for three hundred thousand years mankind was nurtured in the idea of group activities. The blue man most of all profited by these early social teachings, the red man to some extent, and the black man least of all. In more recent times the yellow race and the white race have presented the most advanced social development on Urantia. [^29]
> 
> Although the European blue man did not of himself achieve a great cultural civilization, he did supply the biologic foundation which, when its Adamized strains were blended with the later Andite invaders, produced one of the most potent stocks for the attainment of aggressive civilization ever to appear on Urantia since the times of the violet race and their Andite successors.
> 
> The modern white peoples incorporate the surviving strains of the Adamic stock which became admixed with the Sangik races, some red and yellow but more especially the blue. There is a considerable percentage of the original Andonite stock in all the white races and still more of the early Nodite strains. [^30]

The *blue man* is not the *white race(s)*. Today’s racial bigotry and eugenics issues are not about the blue man.[^31]

## The indigo race

Regarding the indigo race, *The Urantia Book* says:

> 1. *The indigo race*. As the red men were the most advanced of all the Sangik peoples, so the black men were the least progressive. They were the last to migrate from their highland homes. They journeyed to Africa, taking possession of the continent, and have ever since remained there except when they have been forcibly taken away, from age to age, as slaves.[^32]
> 
> Adam’s blood has been shared with most of the human races, but some secured more than others. The mixed races of India and the darker peoples of Africa were not attractive to the Adamites. . . . [^33]
> 
> Isolated in Africa, the indigo peoples, like the red man, received little or none of the race elevation which would have been derived from the infusion of the Adamic stock. Alone in Africa, the indigo race made little advancement until the days of Orvonon, when they experienced a great spiritual awakening. While they later almost entirely forgot the "God of Gods" proclaimed by Orvonon, they did not entirely lose the desire to worship the Unknown; at least they maintained a form of worship up to a few thousand years ago. [^34]
> 
> Notwithstanding their backwardness, these indigo peoples have exactly the same standing before the celestial powers as any other earthly race. [^35]

In the section quoted above on the Sangik races, the authors subtly use synonyms as a literary device to emphasize the humanity of the indigo race. The five previous color designations were followed by the word “man.” The word “race” is only used for the indigos. Apparently, the authors do this–from the title of the subsection to the last paragraph—to place emphasis on the equal status blacks as part of a mutative uplift in human genetic history. They are not to be viewed as modern remnant of slowly evolving primitive man. In this sense, *The Urantia Book* provides a more dignified view than the “out of Africa”[^36] theory, which directly associates blacks with “primitive man” and as precursors to modern humans.

</figure>

Regarding the history of the indigo race, the authors recount:

> The last of the Sangik peoples to migrate from their center of race origin was the indigo man. About the time the green man was killing off the orange race in Egypt and greatly weakening himself in so doing, the great black exodus started south through Palestine along the coast; and later, when these physically strong indigo peoples overran Egypt, they wiped the green man out of existence by sheer force of numbers. These indigo races absorbed the remnants of the orange man and much of the stock of the green man, and certain of the indigo tribes were considerably improved by this racial amalgamation.
> 
> And so it appears that Egypt was first dominated by the orange man, then by the green, followed by the indigo (black) man, and still later by a mongrel race of indigo, blue, and modified green men. But long before Adam arrived, the blue men of Europe and the mixed races of Arabia had driven the indigo race out of Egypt and far south on the African continent. [^37]
> 
> 8. *Pre-Dravidian India*. The complex mixture of races in India—embracing every race on earth, but especially the green, orange, and black—maintained a culture slightly above that of the outlying regions.
> 
> 9. *The Sahara civilization*. The superior elements of the indigo race had their most progressive settlements in what is now the great Sahara desert. This indigoblack group carried extensive strains of the submerged orange and green races. [^38]
> 
> But during earlier times there was little to hinder the westward migration of the Adamites. The Sahara was an open grazing land overspread by herders and agriculturists. These Saharans never engaged in manufacture, nor were they city builders. They were an indigo-black group which carried extensive strains of the extinct green and orange races. But they received a very limited amount of the violet inheritance before the upthrust of land and the shifting water-laden winds dispersed the remnants of this prosperous and peaceful civilization. [^39]
> 
> As the Sangik migrations draw to a close [approximately 60,000 years ago], the green and orange races are gone, the red man holds North America, the yellow man eastern Asia, the blue man Europe, and the indigo race has gravitated to Africa. India harbors a blend of the secondary Sangik races, and the brown man, a blend of the red and yellow, holds the islands off the Asiatic coast. An amalgamated race of rather superior potential occupies the highlands of South America. The purer Andonites live in the extreme northern regions of Europe and in Iceland, Greenland, and northeastern North America. [^40]
> 
> The Saharan civilization had been disrupted by drought and that of the Mediterranean basin by flood. The blue races had, as yet, failed to develop an advanced culture. The Andonites were still scattered over the Arctic and central Asian regions. The green and orange races had been exterminated as such. The indigo race was moving south in Africa, there to begin its slow but longcontinued racial deterioration. [^41]

Long ago, before making global conquests was ever a moral issue, humanity somehow separated itself along racial lines. This allowed the various races (however mixed they may have become at that point), to develop their own cultures, to progress and retrogress in their own way. The authors of *The Urantia Book* are simply pointing out some of the most obvious facets of racial development and asking us to seriously reflect on the implications.

Though the indigo race by definition is disadvantaged compared to the primary Sangik races, this does not equate to the entire race being subnormal. Nothing in *The Urantia Book* supports such an extreme view of the secondary Sangiks. Quite to the contrary, the authors emphasize the equality of the indigo (black) race’s status.

Whether we speak in terms of advantaged/disadvantaged, superior/inferior, or progressive/backwards—the context of these terms is always moving and increasingly complex over time as some parts of the world, both genetically and culturally, advance more than others. This process creates an ever-widening genetic differential. Originally, the endowments of the average indigo man were superior to the average Andonite—physically, intellectually, and spiritually. *The Urantia Book* also describes the indigo race as physically superior in some regards to the primary Sangiks. But just as the early Andonites faced the choice to mate in progressive or retrogressive ways, the Sangik races have the potential to uplift or downgrade their original genetic endowment. This can occur in variety of ways: war, poor mating practices, environments that do not stimulate development, unwise religious beliefs and practices, etc.

The authors wisely write in ways that keep us constantly reminded of this eugenic continuum. Developing mature expressions of civilization is a long process that is hardly complete. *The Urantia Book* points out how even our more advanced expressions of culture reflect the most primitive beliefs.

> . . . In Africa the natives make much ado over their fetish stones. In fact, among all backward tribes and peoples stones are still held in superstitious veneration. Stone worship is even now widespread over the world. The tombstone is a surviving symbol of images and idols which were carved in stone in connection with beliefs in ghosts and the spirits of departed fellow beings.[^42]

The authors are making reference to the unfolding work of these missionaries.

One is the polygenic theory or multiregional hypothesis, according to which *Homo Sapiens* evolved as an interconnected species with *Homo Erectus*. Another theory, the most widely accepted, is the monogenist, or “out of Africa” model, according to which *Homo Sapiens* evolved only in Africa and then spread throughout the rest of the world. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_human#Age_and_speciation_process
