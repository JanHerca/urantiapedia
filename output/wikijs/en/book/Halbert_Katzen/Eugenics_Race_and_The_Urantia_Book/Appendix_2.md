This exploration of *Urantia Book* teachings was originally created for the Topical Studies page of *UBannotated.com*[^1] as a subtopic of “Eugenics and Race.” It now also serves as Appendix 2 of the “Eugenics, Race, and *The Urantia Book*” paper, which was first published as part of the *UBtheNEWS* project in 2011.

This subtopic/Appendix 2 asks the question “Were the Alpheus twins subnormal?” because *The Urantia Book* says they were “the least of all the apostles”[^2].

Along with reviewing commentary about these two Apostles of Jesus, the use of the terms *common people (man)*, *feeble (-mindedness)*, *abnormal*, and *subhuman* are also provided.

The study of how terms are used is followed by consideration of the Biblical passage that precedes the definition of subnormal and comparison to the parallel passage from *The Urantia Book*, recounting this teaching. Additional study questions and perspectives are included at the end.

As far as I know, I am the first person to raise this question and do this type of study. It bears mentioning that simply raising this question has elicited a very negative reaction from some long time reader-believers of *The Urantia Book*. In certain respects, the topic of subnormals is much more difficult to discuss than racial issues. Perhaps this is because it is an even more misunderstood issue.

I am sure that I cannot encourage open mindedness enough. This is what *The Urantia Book* revelation is for--to help us understand things about ourselves and our destiny that we would have a very hard time coming up with on our own. Revelation is not for affirming what we think we already know, but rather to direct us into new and better ways of thinking based on a clearer understanding of the nature of our existence and the wisdom of the creative design. Look for that in this study and you will find it.

In your reflections on this topic, consider the idea that identifying and managing a subnormal class of people is something that could be accomplished by voluntary consent. People who lack the intelligence to compete effectively in competitive, capitalistic economic arenas, generally speaking, are painfully aware of the basic nature of this challenge. If a reasonable alternative was provided, it might be preferred. Because *The Urantia Book*'s discussion of subnormals involves work life considerations, before providing the quotes directly related to the nature of subnormal minded people, some contextualizing passages are provided first.[^3].

> . . . *But there was one economic abuse which [Jesus] many times condemned, and that was the unfair exploitation of the weak, unlearned, and less fortunate of men by their strong, keen, and more intelligent fellows. Jesus declared that such inhuman treatment of men, women, and children was incompatible with the ideals of the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven*.[^4]

On balance, *Urantia Book* teachings about the relationship between working and eating also need to be kept in mind.

> Labor, the efforts of design, distinguishes man from the beast, whose exertions are largely instinctive. The necessity for labor is man's paramount blessing. The Prince's staff all worked; they did much to ennoble physical labor on Urantia. Adam was a gardener; the God of the Hebrews labored—he was the creator and upholder of all things. The Hebrews were the first tribe to put a supreme premium on industry; they were the first people to decree that “he who does not workshall not eat.” But many of the religions of the world reverted to the early ideal of idleness. Jupiter was a reveler, and Buddha became a reflective devotee of leisure.[^5]

> 1. *Doing the Father's will*. Jesus' teaching to trust in the overcare of the heavenly Father was not a blind and passive fatalism. He quoted with approval, on this afternoon, an old Hebrew saying: “He who will not work shall not eat.” . . . [^6]

> While the ideal of society is universal freedom, idlenessshould never be tolerated. All able-bodied persons should be *compelled* to do at least a selfsustaining amount of work. [^7]

## Classification of the three mind types: supernormal, normal, and subnormal

> 1. The Guardian Angels
> 
> The teaching about guardian angels is not a myth; certain groups of human beings do actually have personal angels. It was in recognition of this that Jesus, in speaking of the children of the heavenly kingdom, said: “*Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones, for I say to you, their angels do always behold the presence of the spirit of my Father*.”
> 
> Originally, the seraphim were definitely assigned to the separate Urantia races. But since the bestowal of Michael, they are assigned in accordance with human intelligence, spirituality, and destiny. Intellectually, mankind is divided into three classes:
> 
> 1. The subnormal minded—those who do not exercise normal will power; those who do not make average decisions. This class embraces those who *cannot comprehend* God; they lack capacity for the *intelligent* worship of Deity. The subnormal beings of Urantia have a corps of seraphim, one company[^8], with one battalion of cherubim, assigned to minister to them and to witness that justice and mercy are extended to them in the life struggles of the sphere. [^9].
> 
> 2. The average, normal type of human mind. From the standpoint of seraphic ministry, most men and women are grouped in seven classes in accordance with their status in making the circles of human progress and spiritual development.
> 
> 3. The supernormal minded—those of great decision and undoubted potential of spiritual achievement; men and women who enjoy more or less contact with their indwelling Adjusters; members of the various reserve corps of destiny. No matter in what circle a human happens to be, if such an individual becomes enrolled in any of the several reserve corps of destiny, right then and there, personal seraphim are assigned, and from that time until the earthly career is finished, that mortal will enjoy the continuous ministry and unceasing watchcare of a guardian angel. Also, when any human being makes *the* supreme decision, when there is a real betrothal with the Adjuster, a personal guardian is immediately assigned to that soul.
> 
> In the ministry to so-called normal beings, seraphic assignments are made in accordance with the human attainment of the circles of intellectuality and spirituality. You start out in your mind of mortal investment in the seventh circle and journey inward in the task of self-understanding, self-conquest, and selfmastery; and circle by circle you advance until (if natural death does not terminate your career and transfer your struggles to the mansion worlds) you reach the first or inner circle of relative contact and communion with the indwelling Adjuster.
> 
> Human beings in the initial or seventh circle have one guardian angel with one company of assisting cherubim assigned to the watchcare and custody of one thousand mortals. In the sixth circle, a seraphic pair with one company of cherubim is assigned to guide these ascending mortals in groups of five hundred. When the fifth circle is attained, human beings are grouped in companies of approximately one hundred, and a pair of guardian seraphim with a group of cherubim is placed in charge. Upon attainment of the fourth circle, mortal beings are assembled in groups of ten, and again charge is given to a pair of seraphim, assisted by one company of cherubim.
> 
> When a mortal mind breaks through the inertia of animal legacy and attains the third circle of human intellectuality and acquired spirituality, a personal angel (in reality two) will henceforth be wholly and exclusively devoted to this ascending mortal. And thus these human souls, in addition to the everpresent and increasingly efficient indwelling Thought Adjusters, receive the undivided assistance of these personal guardians of destiny in all their efforts to finish the third circle, traverse the second, and attain the first.[^10]

Regarding the description of subnormals at [UB 113:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_3), as being unable to comprehend God or to engage in intelligent worship, also consider:

> A good and noble man may be consummately in love with his wife but utterly unable to pass a satisfactory written examination on the psychology of marital love. Another man, having little or no love for his spouse, might pass such an examination most acceptably. The imperfection of the lover's insight into the true nature of the beloved does not in the least invalidate either the reality or sincerity of his love.[^11]

Managing and ministering to the subnormal population.

> . . . From a world standpoint, overpopulation has never been a serious problem in the past, but if war is lessened and science increasingly controls human diseases, it may become a serious problem in the near future. At such a time the great test of the wisdom of world leadership will present itself. Will Urantia rulers have the insight and courage to foster the multiplication of the average or stabilized human being instead of the extremes of the supernormal and the enormously increasing groups of the subnormal? The normal man should be fostered; he is the backbone of civilization and the source of the mutant geniuses of the race. The subnormal man should be kept under society's control; no more should be produced than are required to administer the lower levels of industry, those tasks requiring *intelligence above the animal level but making such lowgrade demands as to prove veritable slavery and bondage for the higher types of mankind*. [^12]

Note how the construction of the first sentence in the paragraph below makes feeble-mindedness and subnormal synonymous. From Paper 72: Government on a Neighboring Planet.

> The feeble-minded are trained only in agriculture and animal husbandry, and are committed for life to special custodial colonies where they are segregated by sex to prevent parenthood, which is denied all subnormals. These restrictive measures have been in operation for seventy-five years; the commitment decrees are handed down by the parental courts. [^13]

With this in mind, now consider these other passages related to feeble-mindedness:

> The advanced stages of a world settled in light and life represent the acme of evolutionary material development. On these cultured worlds, gone are the idleness and friction of the earlier primitive ages. Poverty and social inequality have all but vanished, degeneracy has disappeared, and delinquency is rarely observed. Insanity has practically ceased to exist, and feeble-mindedness is a rarity. [^14]

Does the paragraph above mean that the birth of subnormals among the normal minded population has become a rarity (in contrast to subnormals who “should be produced” as is “required to administer the lower levels of industry”)? Or in light and life are the lower levels of industry somehow managed out of the culture so that a subnormal population is no longer valuable to the economic ecology of the civilization?

> On no world can evil spirits possess any mortal mind subsequent to the life of a Paradise bestowal Son. But before the days of Christ Michael on Urantia—before the universal coming of the Thought Adjusters and the pouring out of the Master's spirit upon all flesh—these rebel midwayers were actually able to influence the minds of certain inferior mortalsand somewhat to control their actions. This was accomplished in much the same way as the loyal midway creatures function when they serve as efficient contact guardians of the human minds of the Urantia reserve corps of destiny at those times when the Adjuster is, in effect, detached from the personality during a season of contact with superhuman intelligences. . . .
> 
> Even prior to Pentecost no rebel spirit could dominate a normal human mind, and since that day even the weak minds of inferior mortals are free from such possibilities. The supposed casting out of devils since the arrival of the Spirit of Truth has been a matter of confounding a belief in demoniacal possession with hysteria, insanity, and feeble-mindedness. But just because Michael's bestowal has forever liberated all human minds on Urantia from the possibility of demoniacal possession, do not imagine that such was not a reality in former ages.
> 
> The entire group of rebel midwayers is at present held prisoner by order of the Most Highs of Edentia. No more do they roam this world on mischief bent. Regardless of the presence of the Thought Adjusters, the pouring out of the Spirit of Truth upon all flesh forever made it impossible for disloyal spirits of any sort or description ever again to invade even the most feeble of human minds. Since the day of Pentecost there never again can be such a thing as demoniacal possession. [^15]

Given that prior to Pentecost “the seraphim were definitely assigned to the separate Urantia races,” and since Pentecost the seraphim are organized relative to mind types, how might this be related to the universal bestowal of Thought Adjusters? Does this imply that Thought Adjusters are now universally bestowed upon the subnormals of all races? Could this relate to why it is important to “despise not one of these little ones, for I say to you, their angels do always behold the presence of the spirit of my Father?”

> The miller he taught about grinding up the grains of truth in the mill of living experience so as to render the difficult things of divine life readily receivable by even the weak and feeble among one's fellow mortals. Said Jesus: “Give the milk of truth to those who are babes in spiritual perception. In your living and loving ministry serve spiritual food in attractive form and suited to the capacity of receptivity of each of your inquirers.” [^16]

## Abnormal

Abnormal is used six times:
1. Referring to “abnormal and defective” strains [UB 52:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_11).
2. Referring to “degenerate, abnormal and inferior unsalvable” human beings [UB 52:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_12).
3. As a vision that primitive man had of women, considering them as “peculiar, and even abnormal” [UB 84:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_5).
4. As strange people that primitive men came to worship, because “they believed that these abnormal beings [such as lunatics, epileptics and the feeble-minded] were indwelt by the gods” [UB 85:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p6_2).
5. As a trait that early men “attributed to spirit possession” [UB 90:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p1_2)
6. As a mental state (“abnormal mental manifestations”) that some mystics have attempted to achieve through mental dissociation. It is a mystical practice that *The Urantia Book* advises against as a spiritual practice [UB 100:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_9)

## The Alpheus Twins

The Alpheus twins are mentioned in these passages:
1. Jesus visits their home and the “twins are welcomed into the apostolic family.” He mentions in the same passage that all the apostles, and not just the Alphaeans, had “very difficult to understand many of the teachings” of Jesus [UB 138:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p4_3).
2. “Santiago Alfeo especially loved Jesus for the Master's simplicity. *These twins could not comprehend the mind of Jesus*, but they did grasp the sympathetic bond between themselves and the heart of their Master. His mind *was not of a high order; they might even reverently be called stupid, but they had a real experience in their spiritual natures*. They believed in Jesus; They were sons of God and fellows of the kingdom.” [UB 139:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p9_6). Might not of a high order be a polite way of saying they were of a lower order–subnormal? Regarding reverently called stupid, see also below [UB 133:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p5_12) in reference to Athenians.
3. “Judas Alpheus was drawn toward Jesus because of the Master's unostentatious humility. Such humility linked with such personal dignity made a great appeal to Judas. The fact that Jesus would always enjoin silence regarding his unusual acts made a great impression on this *simple child of nature*” [UB 139:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p9_7).
4. We are said of them that were “simple-minded helpers”, “men of one talent” (in clear allusion to the parable of the talents).But the reason why Jesus chose them for a position of such relevance as that of apostles is explained: “Jesus welcomed these young men of one talent to positions of honor on his personal staff in the kingdom because there are untold millions of other such simple and fear-ridden souls on the worlds of space whom he likewise wishes to welcome into active and believing fellowship with himself and his outpoured Spirit of Truth. Jesus does not look down upon littleness, only upon evil and sin. James and Judas were *little*, but they were also *faithful*. They were simple and ignorant, but they were also big-hearted, kind, and generous.” [UB 139:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p9_8).
5. They are called “humble men” in contrast to the “rich man who wanted to be an evangelist,” but to emphasize Jesus' stance toward their acceptance: “Jesus was no respecter of persons. Only a divine institution —the kingdom of heaven— could be built on such mediocre human foundations!”[^17] [UB 139:9.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p9_9).
6. It is said that all the apostles “except the Alphaeus twins, were graduates of the synagogue schools” [UB 139:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p0_3).
7. They were “sons of Alpheus . . . twin fishermen . . . they lived near Kheresa . . . with 26 years and both children” [UB 139:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p9_1).
8. The task of the Alpheus in the apostolic group was “the management of the multitudes” and “to maintain order among the crowds during the preaching” [UB 138:10.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_8).
9. They are described as “mediocre” and “common people” [UB 139:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p9_4). See “common people” below.
10. All the apostles “*except the Alpheus twins*” are able to give their interpretation of the parable of the sower [UB 151:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p2_8).
11. “*Alpheus twins had no opinion*” on whether Jesus should be crowned king in front of crowds in the park south of Bethsaida-Julias [UB 152:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_5).
12. “*The twins were blissfully ignorant*” about the controversy over what the kingdom of heaven would be when it came [UB 144:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p1_7).
13. “*Except the twins*” few of the rest of the apostles could sleep when Jesus perplexed them with his attitude after the miraculous mass healing at sunset [UB 145:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p4_3).
14. The apostles, again “confused and disconcerted”, did not get much sleep on the way back to Bethany and Bethphage after being in Jerusalem, “*save the twins*” [UB 172:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_1).
15. At the point of the crisis in Capernaum, the apostles are “depressed” and each one shows different ideas that reflect concern about what may happen [UB 153:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p0_2). “The only word of cheerful greeting or well-wishing from any of his immediate followers came from one of the unsuspecting Alpheus twins, who, as Jesus left the house on his way to the synagogue, saluted him cheerily and said: “We pray the Father will help you, and that we may have bigger multitudes than ever.” [UB 153:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p0_3).
16. When they go up Mount Sartaba to rest for a few days, one of the apostles was “perplexed”, another “troubled”, another “hard pressed”, another “overwrought”, another “depressed”. All showed some symptom of overwhelm. “*Only the twins were in normal and unperturbed*” [UB 143:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p3_5).
17. When the apostles leave Jerusalem on Triumphal Entry Sunday, everyone is very unsettled and confused. [UB 172:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5). “The twins are the only ones who have been satisfied that day. “To the Alpheus twins this was a perfect day. They really enjoyed it all the way through, and not being present during the time of quiet visitation about the temple, they escaped much of the anticlimax of the popular upheaval. They could not possibly understand the downcast behavior of the apostles when they came back to Bethany that evening. In the memory of the twins this was always their day of being nearest heaven on earth. This day was the satisfying climax of their whole career as apostles. And the memory of the elation of this Sunday afternoon carried them on through all of the tragedy of this eventful week, right up to the hour of the crucifixion. It was the most befitting entry of the king the twins could conceive; they enjoyed every moment of the whole pageant. They fully approved of all they saw and long cherished the memory” [UB 172:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_11).
18. During the Last Supper Judas Alphaeus dares “to ask one of the few questions that he or his brother ever addressed to Jesus in public . . .: “Master, you have always lived among us as a friend; how shall we know you when you no longer manifest yourself to us save by this spirit? If the world sees you not, how shall we be certain about you? How will you show yourself to us? [UB 180:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_5). After the answer, “*Judas Alphaeus did not fully understand* what the Master had said, but he caught the promise of a new instructor, and by the expression on Andrew's face, he perceived that his question had been answered satisfactorily” [UB 180:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_6).
19. After the news of the resurrection of Jesus, the apostles discussed what this could mean. [UB 190:0](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p0). The Alpheus twins took little part in these serious discussions; they were fairly busy with their customary ministrations. One of them expressed the attitude of both when he said, in reply to a question asked by Philip: “We do not understand about the resurrection, but our mother says she talked with the Master, and we believe her.” [UB 190:0.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p0_11).
20. Saying his farewell words to the Alphaeus at the last supper, he tells them that of the three pairs of Jewish brothers (Andrew-Simon, James-John and them), “none has done better” than the two of them in “working in peace ” with the Jews. “*You may not understand all* that will befall you and your brethren, but *never doubt* that you were once called to the work of the kingdom,” he tells them, but assures them of reception in heaven, “where in glory you shall tell of your salvation to seraphic hosts and to multitudes of the high Sons of God.” He exempts them from continuing with the apostolate if they wish (“you should go back to your former labors with the new enlightenment of the experience of sonship with God”), and finally assures them that “you have been my apostles, and you always shall be, and I will remember you in the kingdom to come.” [UB 181:2.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_19)
21. Addressing a few words to each apostle after meeting them resurrected, he said to the Alphaeus: “James and Judas, do you believe in me?” And when the two answered: “Yes, Master, we do believe”, Jesus said: “I will soon leave you. You see that I have already left you in the flesh. I tarry only a short time in this form before I go to my Father. You believe in me—you are my apostles, and you always will be. Go on believing and remembering your association with me, when I am gone, and after you have, perchance, returned to the work you used to do before you came to live with me. Never allow a change in your outward work to influence your allegiance. Have faith in God to the end of your days on earth. Never forget that, when you are a faith son of God, all upright work of the realm is sacred. Nothing which a son of God does can be common. Do your work, therefore, from this time on, as for God. And when you are through on this world, I have other and better worlds where you shall likewise work for me. And in all of this work, on this world and on other worlds, I will work with you, and my spirit shall dwell within you.” [UB 192:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_13).
22. “The twins served faithfully until the end, until the dark days of trial, crucifixion, and despair. They never lost their heart faith in Jesus, and (save John) they were the first to believe in his resurrection. But *they could not comprehend the establishment of the kingdom*. Soon after their Master was crucified, they returned to their families and nets; their work was done. *They had not the ability to go on in the more complex battles of the kingdom*. But they lived and died conscious of having been honored and blessed with four years of close and personal association with a Son of God, the sovereign maker of a universe” [UB 139:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p9_11).

At [UB 158:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p7_1) the twins are described as stolid. Definition: “(of a person) calm, dependable, and showing little emotion or animation.” Could this be a suggestion regarding the eugenic management of subnormal populations?

## Common People (Man)

Common man is used once:

> . . . Men have also made a fetish of democracy, the exaltation and adoration of the *common man*'s ideas when collectively called “public opinion.” One man's opinion, when taken by itself, is not regarded as worth much, but when many men are collectively functioning as a democracy, this same mediocre judgment is held to be the arbiter of justice and the standard of righteousness.[^18]

Consider how much sense the following quotes make and how easy it is to make good sense of them when common people is considered to be a way of distinguishing subnormal and normal minded people from supernormal minded people.

> . . . Even common people were able to regard the matured concept of Yahweh as a Father, if not of the individual, at least of the race. [^19]

> . . . The common people craved promises of salvation—religious consolation for today and assurances of hope for immortality after death. [^20]

> These philosophies were semireligious; they were often invigorating, ethical, and ennobling but were usually above the common people. With the possible exception of Cynicism, they were philosophies for the strong and the wise, not religions of salvation for even the poor and the weak. [^21]

> . . . Joseph's immediate ancestors were mechanics—builders, carpenters, masons, and smiths. Joseph himself was a carpenter and later a contractor. His family belonged to a long and illustrious line of the nobility of the common people, accentuated ever and anon by the appearance of unusual individuals who had distinguished themselves in connection with the evolution of religion on Urantia. [^22]

> Of all couples living in Palestine at about the time of Michael's projected bestowal, Joseph and Mary possessed the most ideal combination of widespread racial connections and superior average of personality endowments. *It was the plan of Michael to appear on earth as an average man, that the common people might understand him and receive him*; wherefore Gabriel selected just such persons as Joseph and Mary to become the bestowal parents. [^23]

> The common people heard Jesus gladly, and they will again respond to the presentation of his sincere human life of consecrated religious motivation if such truths shall again be proclaimed to the world. The people heard him gladly because he was one of them, an unpretentious layman; the world's greatest religious teacher was indeed a layman. [^24]

> The common people marveled at the teaching and ministry of Jesus and his apostles. The rabbis had long taught the Jews that the ignorant could not be pious or righteous. But Jesus' apostles were both pious and righteous; yet they were cheerfully ignorant of much of the learning of the rabbis and the wisdom of the world. [^25]

> The multitudes of the common people were greatly encouraged to find two like themselves honored with places among the apostles. By their very acceptance as apostles these mediocre twins were the means of bringing a host of fainthearted believers into the kingdom. And, too, the common people took more kindly to the idea of being directed and managed by official ushers who were very much like themselves. [^26]

> . . . And it was chiefly because of this need for some simple petition for the common people that Jesus at this time consented, in answer to Thomas's request, to teach them a suggestive form of prayer. . . . [^27]

> While, at that particular time, the fame of Jesus rested chiefly upon his reputation as a healer . . . But it was the physical cures that made the most direct and immediate appeal to the common people. . . . [^28]

> Jesus' apostles, let alone the common people, could not understand the nature and attributes of this God-man. Neither has any subsequent generation been able to evaluate what took place on earth in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. . . . [^29]

## Subnormal does not mean subhuman

Subhuman is used five times in four paragraphs:
1. “The unique feature of mind is that it can be bestowed upon such a wide range of life. Through his creative and creature associates the Third Source and Center ministers to all minds on all spheres. He ministers to human and *subhuman* intellect through the adjutants of the local universes and, through the agency of the physical controllers, ministers even to the lowest nonexperiencing entities of the most primitive types of living things. And always is the direction of mind a ministry of mind-spirit or mind-energy personalities.” [UB 9:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p5_3)
2. “The superevolutionary orders of personality in a local universe are endowed with the local universe type of the superuniverse pattern of mind. The human and the *subhuman* orders of evolutionary life are endowed with the adjutant spirit types of mind ministration.” [UB 34:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p4_9)
3. “Adjutant-spirit minds. This is the ministry of a local universe Mother Spirit functioning through her seven adjutant mind-spirits on the teachable (nonmechanical) level of material mind. On this level material mind is experiencing: as *subhuman* (animal) intellect in the first five adjutants; as human (moral) intellect in the seven adjutants; as superhuman (midwayer) intellect in the last two adjutants.” [UB 42:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p10_4)
4. “While the early Neanderthalers were spread out over the entire breadth of Eurasia, the eastern wing was the more contaminated with debased animal strains. These *subhuman* types were pushed south by the fifth glacier, the same ice sheet which so long blocked Sangik migration into eastern Asia. And when the red man moved northeast around the highlands of India, he found northeastern Asia free from these *subhuman* types. The tribal organization of the red races was formed earlier than that of any other peoples, and they were the first to migrate from the central Asian focus of the Sangiks. The inferior Neanderthal strains were destroyed or driven off the mainland by the later migrating yellow tribes. But the red man had reigned supreme in eastern Asia for almost one hundred thousand years before the yellow tribes arrived.” [UB 79:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p5_2)

## Biblical Quote and Related *Urantia Book* Passage

The Bible quote at [UB 113:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_1), “Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones, for I say to you, their angels do always behold the presence of the spirit of my Father,” comes from [Matthew 18:10](/en/Bible/Matthew/18#v10). The King James Version for Matthew 18:1-11 reads:

> ^1^ In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
> 
> ^2^ And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
> 
> ^3^ And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
> 
> ^4^ Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
> 
> ^5^ And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
> 
> ^6^ But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
> 
> ^7^ Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
> 
> ^8^ Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
> 
> ^9^ And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
> 
> ^10^ *Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven*.
> 
> ^11^ For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.[^30]

Notice how in the Bible it says “see the face of my Father.” The related passage in *The Urantia Book* reads:

> While David Zebedee made ready to take them across the lake, they lingered at Simon's house, and Jesus, looking up at Peter and the other apostles, asked: “As you walked along together this afternoon, what was it that you talked about so earnestly among yourselves?” The apostles held their peace because many of them had continued the discussion begun at Mount Hermon as to what positions they were to have in the coming kingdom; who should be the greatest, and so on. Jesus, knowing what it was that occupied their thoughts that day, beckoned to one of Peter's little ones and, setting the child down among them, said: “Verily, verily, I say to you, except you turn about and become more like this child, you will make little progress in the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever shall humble himself and become as this little one, the same shall become greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso receives such a little one receives me. And they who receive me receive also Him who sent me. If you would be first in the kingdom, seek to minister these good truths to your brethren in the flesh. But whosoever causes one of these little ones to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea. If the things you do with your hands, or the things you see with your eyes give offense in the progress of the kingdom, sacrifice these cherished idols, for it is better to enter the kingdom minus many of the beloved things of life rather than to cling to these idols and find yourself shut out of the kingdom. But most of all, *see that you despise not one of these little ones, for their angels do always behold the faces of the heavenly hosts*.”.[^31]

In *The Urantia Book* it is said “they see the face of the heavenly hosts”. Heavenly hosts is only used twice. Its use in the context of social order is noteworthy, given the above commentary on managing the population of subnormals.

> “The Father in heaven loves his children, and therefore should you learn to love one another; the Father in heaven forgives you your sins; therefore should you learn to forgive one another. If your brother sins against you, go to him and with tact and patience show him his fault. And do all this between you and him alone. If he will listen to you, then have you won your brother. But if your brother will not hear you, if he persists in the error of his way, go again to him, taking with you one or two mutual friends that you may thus have two or even three witnesses to confirm your testimony and establish the fact that you have dealt justly and mercifully with your offending brother. Now if he refuses to hear your brethren, you may tell the whole story to the congregation, and then, if he refuses to hear the brotherhood, let them take such action as they deem wise; let such an unruly member become an outcast from the kingdom. While you cannot pretend to sit in judgment on the souls of your fellows, and while you may not forgive sins or otherwise presume to usurp the prerogatives of *the supervisors of the heavenly hosts*, at the same time, it has been committed to your hands that you should maintain temporal order in the kingdom on earth. While you may not meddle with the divine decrees concerning eternal life, you shall determine the issues of conduct as they concern the temporal welfare of the brotherhood on earth. And so, in all these matters connected with the discipline of the brotherhood, whatsoever you shall decree on earth, shall be recognized in heaven. Although you cannot determine the eternal fate of the individual, you may legislate regarding the conduct of the group, for, where two or three of you agree concerning any of these things and ask of me, it shall be done for you if your petition is not inconsistent with the will of my Father in heaven. And all this is ever true, for, where two or three believers are gathered together, there am I in the midst of them.”.[^32]

What is the significance between using Father vs. heavenly hosts? Should our Father be included within the definition of heavenly hosts? Is this change from what Jesus originally said an inspired change, based on the universal bestowal of Thought Adjusters post Pentecost?

## Additional Perspective and Questions To Consider

The US military will not take anyone with an IQ below 83 because they end up requiring more care and oversight than what they can produce for benefit. Bearing in mind that agriculture is not a military type of activity, consider the following passages.

> From a world standpoint, overpopulation has never been a serious problem in the past, but if war is lessened and science increasingly controls human diseases, it may become a serious problem in the near future. At such a time the great test of the wisdom of world leadership will present itself. Will Urantia rulers have the insight and courage to foster the multiplication of the average or stabilized human being instead of the extremes of the supernormal and the enormously increasing groups of the subnormal? The normal man should be fostered; he is the backbone of civilization and the source of the mutant geniuses of the race. The subnormal man should be kept under society's control; no more should be produced than are required to administer the lower levels of industry, those tasks requiring intelligence above the animal level but making such low- grade demands as to prove veritable slavery and bondage for the higher types of mankind. [^33]

> [From Government on a Neighboring Planet:] The feeble-minded are trained only in agriculture and animal husbandry, and are committed for life to special custodial colonies where they are segregated by sex to prevent parenthood, which is denied all subnormals. These restrictive measures have been in operation for seventy-five years; the commitment decrees are handed down by the parental courts. [^34]

What relationship might the following paragraphs have to considerations about subnormals before and after Pentecost (and while in Jesus' presence perhaps)?:

> Culture presupposes quality of mind; culture cannot be enhanced unless mind is elevated. Superior intellect will seek a noble culture and find some way to attain such a goal. Inferior minds will spurn the highest culture even when presented to them ready-made. Much depends, also, upon the successive missions of the divine Sons and upon the extent to which enlightenment is received by the ages of their respective dispensations. [^35]

> The sojourn in Athens was pleasant and profitable, but it was not particularly fruitful in its human contacts. Too many of the Athenians of that day were either intellectually proud of their reputation of another day or mentally stupid and ignorant, being the offspring of the inferior slaves of those earlier periods when there was glory in Greece and wisdom in the minds of its people. Even then, there were still many keen minds to be found among the citizens of Athens. [^36]

Can subnormals Father-fuse? Spirit-fuse?

What is the relationship between “poor” racial mixtures and subnormals?

What are the genetic factors related to both temperament and intelligence?
