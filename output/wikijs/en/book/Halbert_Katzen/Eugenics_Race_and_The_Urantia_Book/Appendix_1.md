This appendix integrates *The Urantia Book*’s history of humanity with taxonomy. To a certain extent, this involves an expansion and reconstruction of the *Homo* genus. This taxonomy was created to support visitors to the *UBtheNEWS* website in their efforts to get a better understanding of the anthropology-related reports and to supplement the Eugenics, Race, and *The Urantia Book* paper.

*The Urantia Book* does not directly make use of our Latin-based classification system. However, it does make some statements that not only correlate with the taxonomy classification system but also suggest ways to refine it.

“Backmating” is a subject that many people do not like to discuss when it comes to human evolution. For some people, the thought that our ancient human ancestors contaminated our gene pool with subhuman genetics is an uncomfortable subject. Nonetheless, it is hardly surprising that such a thing would have occurred, and this is exactly what happened according to *The Urantia Book*.

In its explanation of human evolution, *The Urantia Book* provides insights into how God’s plan makes good of the full spectrum of evolutionary life. The authors indicate that while our development toward operating by better procreative standards and clearer boundaries is certainly desirable, the failure to appreciate the wisdom behind a process of human evolution that embraces such a full spectrum of expression is our shortcoming, not God’s. *The Urantia Book* helps us bridge that gulf. This is an important part of the book’s purpose, but this paper is not the place for that conversation.

*The Urantia Book* teaches that the first human beings—individuals whose minds functioned with human wisdom—were a pair of twins (named Andon and Fonta), and it says that they were the unique origin of humanity, exhibiting this quality of mind function in the first generation of the mutation that created them approximately one million years ago. Regarding human evolution, *The Urantia Book* explains:

> Even the loss of Andon and Fonta before they had offspring, though delaying human evolution, would not have prevented it. Subsequent to the appearance of Andon and Fonta and before the mutating human potentials of animal life were exhausted, there evolved no less than seven thousand favorable strains which could have achieved some sort of human type of development. And many of these better stocks were subsequently assimilated by the various branches of the expanding human species. [^1]

Of course, a purely scientific approach does not lead logically to the conclusion that the evolutionary process that produced the first human beings would stop once the first ones evolved. This only becomes logical when evolution is viewed as the technique of creation, which is what *The Urantia Book* teaches. “Mankind on Urantia must solve its problems of mortal development with the human stocks it has—no more races will evolve from prehuman sources throughout all future time. But this fact does not preclude the possibility of the attainment of vastly higher levels of human development through the intelligent fostering of the evolutionary potentials still resident in the mortal races.”[^2] From the standpoint of interpersonal relationships, it is easier to promote peace and harmony among all people with the belief that we all came from the same original couple. If God makes life operate in this manner, this is at least consistent with the logic of love.

The suggestion that primitive human beings—Andonites—might have been able to mate with other subspecies that did not have human potential is consistent with the difficulties anthropologists have in trying to explain the fossil records and establish a clear line of evolution to *Homo sapiens* (“*H. sapiens*”) and *H. sapiens sapiens*. Because erect posture is generally appreciated as being fundamental to the evolution of human beings and because of the position that *erectus* currently holds in taxonomy, this term is an obvious choice for inclusion in the line leading directly to *H. sapiens sapiens*.

Within *The Urantia Book*’s framework for defining humanity, the essential human quality— human wisdom—cannot be identified skeletally. As the quote above indicates, the first human beings were able to backmate with others in their species who did not exhibit human qualities (though some of their mixed offspring did exhibit human wisdom). Additionally, *The Urantia Book* draws a distinction with respect to whether a population’s general genetic foundation is sufficient to support advanced civilization.

*The Urantia Book* teaches that there was not a genetic foundation sufficient to support civilization in the original mutation that created a human level of wisdom. It was sufficient for a human level of wisdom to develop in some individuals, but not sufficient to create a group level of human wisdom—the wisdom necessary to get beyond the Stone Age and begin the creation of an advanced civilization.

## A Urantia Book-based taxonomy of human beings

* *Homo erectus prosapiens*: The Andonites, descendants of the first two human beings, an evolutionary mutation occurring approximately 1,000,000 years ago. Because humanity is said to only have evolved directly through the Andonites, all *prosapiens* must have some amount of Andonite heritage. From a skeletal standpoint, of course, it is impossible to tell whether a specific individual was actually functioning with human wisdom. But in general, those archaeological sites presenting fossils and/or other artifacts indicating more advanced tool making probably had a significantly higher percentage of their populations functioning with human wisdom than their less developed contemporaries. *The Urantia Book* states:

	> *950,000* years ago the descendants of Andon and Fonta had migrated far to the east and to the west. To the west they passed over Europe to France and England. In later times they penetrated eastward as far as Java, where their bones were so recently found—the so-called Java man—and then journeyed on to Tasmania.
	> 
	> The groups going west became less contaminated with the backward stocks of mutual ancestral origin than those going east, who mingled so freely with their retarded animal cousins. These unprogressive individuals drifted southward and presently mated with the inferior tribes. Later on, increasing numbers of their mongrel descendants returned to the north to mate with the rapidly expanding Andonic peoples, and such unfortunate unions unfailingly deteriorated the superior stock. . . .. [^3]

* *Homo erectus subsapiens*: This classification encompasses the full range of types that are able to reproduce with* H. erectus prosapiens* but do not have the genetic foundation necessary to support the function of human wisdom. The “seven thousand favorable strains which could have achieved some sort of human type of development” and “were subsequently assimilated by the various branches of the expanding human species” are in this classification. Without having a direct connection to Andon and Fonta—dthe first *H. erectus prosapiens*—no individual, according to *The Urantia Book*, can be a *H. erectus prosapiens*. The previous quotes relate to the time period after the development of *H. erectus prosapiens* and encompasses the full spectrum of *H. erectus subsapiens*—ones that stand practically no chance of producing offspring that will attain human wisdom through those whose offspring would have an excellent chance.

	*The Urantia Book* states:

	> *900,000* years ago the arts of Andon and Fonta and the culture of Onagar were vanishing from the face of the earth; culture, religion, and even flintworking were at their lowest ebb.
	> 
	> These were the times when large numbers of inferior mongrel groups were arriving in England from southern France. These tribes were so largely mixed with the forest apelike creatures that they were scarcely human. They had no religion but were crude flintworkers and possessed sufficient intelligence to kindle fire. [^4]

	As well, though *The Urantia Book* is not specific on the subject, it is presumable that species were evolving toward human beings that were not in the direct line of *Homo erectus*, but nonetheless reproductively compatible with *H. erectus prosapiens*. What is currently defined as *H. ergaster* is an example of H. erectus subsapiens existing prior to *H. erectus prosapiens*.

* *Homo neanderthalensis*: The Neanderthal race as defined in *The Urantia Book*:

	> *850,000* years ago the superior Badonan tribes [H. erectus prosapiens living in the Afghanistan region] began a warfare of extermination directed against their inferior and animalistic neighbors. . . . This campaign for the extermination of inferiors brought about a slight improvement in the hill tribes of that age. And the mixed descendants of this improved Badonite stock appeared on the stage of action as an apparently new people—the *Neanderthal race*.[^5]

	This upstepping of *H. erectus* while sufficient to warrant a classification in the evolution toward *H. sapiens*, is still insufficient to support civilization. Additionally, because of the relatively rapid spread of these upstepped Andonites and immediate mixing with the full spectrum of *H. erectus prosapiens* to *H. erectus subsapiens*, functionally, *H. neanderthalis* needs to be further classified as either prosapiens or subsapiens. Because of the extensive mixing, on the whole, *H. neanderthalis* was retrogressing.

* *Homo neanderthalensis prosapiens*: The improved superior Badonans (*H. neanderthalensis*) blended with the Andonites (*H. erectus prosapiens*).

* *Homo neanderthalensis subsapiens*: *H. neanderthalensis* backmated with *H. erectus subsapiens*.

* *Homo sapiens*: *The Urantia Book* recounts:

	> *500,000* years ago the Badonan tribes of the northwestern highlands of India became involved in another great racial struggle. For more than one hundred years this relentless warfare raged, and when the long fight was finished, only about one hundred families were left. But these survivors were the most intelligent and desirable of all the then living descendants of Andon and Fonta.
	> 
	> And now, among these highland Badonites there was a new and strange occurrence. A man and woman living in the northeastern part of the then inhabited highland region began *suddenly* to produce a family of unusually intelligent children. This was the *Sangik family*, the ancestors of all of the six colored races of Urantia.
	> 
	> These Sangik children, nineteen in number, were not only intelligent above their fellows, but their skins manifested a unique tendency to turn various colors upon exposure to sunlight. Among these nineteen children were five red, two orange, four yellow, two green, four blue, and two indigo. These colors became more pronounced as the children grew older, and when these youths later mated with their fellow tribesmen, all of their offspring tended toward the skin color of the Sangik parent.[^6]
	> 
	> On an average evolutionary planet the six evolutionary races of color appear one by one; the red man is the first to evolve, and for ages he roams the world before the succeeding colored races make their appearance. The simultaneous emergence of all six races on Urantia, and in one family, was most unusual. [^7]
	> 
	> On those worlds having all six evolutionary races the superior peoples are the first, third, and fifth races—the red, the yellow, and the blue. The evolutionary races thus alternate in capacity for intellectual growth and spiritual development, the second, fourth, and sixth being somewhat less endowed. . . . [^8]

	As these progenitors mingled with *H. neanderthalensis prosapiens* from their tribe they created the variously colored races. As this pattern continued to unfold, it increasingly mixed in *H. neanderthalensis prosapiens. Functionally, *H. neanderthalensis prosapiens* are blended with either the *primary or secondary Sangik races.

	 *The Urantia Book* indicates that *H. sapiens* had no tendency toward backmating; not surprisingly, civilization depends on a genetic foundation that does not have a tendency to backmate.

* *Homo sapiens primarius*: The Primary Sangiks; the red, yellow, and blue races.

* *Homo sapiens secundarius*: The Secondary Sangiks; the orange, green, and indigo races.

	Regarding skeletal structure generally and the orange and green races, in particular, *The Urantia Book* states:

	> . . . [M]ortal stature tends to decrease from the red man down to the indigo race, although on Urantia unexpected strains of giantism appeared among the green and orange peoples. [^9]
	> 
	> The last great struggle between the orange and the green men occurred in the region of the lower Nile valley in Egypt. This long-drawn-out battle was waged for almost one hundred years, and at its close very few of the orange race were left alive. The shattered remnants of these people were absorbed by the green and by the later arriving indigo men. But as a race the orange man ceased to exist about one hundred thousand years ago. [^10]
	> 
	> In many ways both groups were evenly matched in this struggle since each carried strains of the giant order, many of their leaders being eight and nine feet in height. These giant strains of the green man were mostly confined to this southern or Egyptian nation.
	> 
	> The remnants of the victorious green men were subsequently absorbed by the indigo race, the last of the colored peoples to develop and emigrate from the original Sangik center of race dispersion. [^11]

* *Homo sapiens transerectus*: The Nodites. *The Urantia Book* recounts two instances of extraterrestrial visitation that involved contributions to the human gene pool; they occurred approximately 200,000 years ago and 38,000 years ago. It says that these events have become confused and distorted over time but that our religious traditions still preserve them to a very limited degree. The Nodites are mentioned, of course, in the Bible. Cain is said to have gone to the “land of Nod.” Our religious traditions about Adam and Eve relate to the second occurrence of extraterrestrial genetic contribution, according to *The Urantia Book*.

	According to the cosmology in *The Urantia Book*, receiving a genetic uplift from extraterrestrials (an order of beings known as Adams and Eves) is a normal part of the evolutionary development of planet and such a plan is carried out in manner that is universally appreciated and anticipated. Our world is not following the normal course of events; both the genetic uplift and our understanding of it have been severely compromised. Religious traditions regarding the spiritual rebellion of Lucifer, Satan, the Devil, etc. and the rule breaking of Adam and Eve reflect the basic thrust of *The Urantia Book*’s explanation. These extraterrestrial visitations are supposed to be coordinated with and accompanied by the ongoing wise and loving overcare of immortals.

	*The Urantia Book*’s cosmology includes an explanation of the celestial overcare that arrives with the development of *H. sapiens*. This administration includes 100 human-looking extraterrestrial staff members, mixing some advanced genetics with “Andonic germ plasm,” which may mean the more evolved *H. neanderthalensis prosapiens*.

	More specifically, regarding the Nodite race, *The Urantia Book* says:

	> The postrebellion era on Urantia [starting approximately 200,000 years ago] witnessed many unusual happenings. . . . “The Nephilim (Nodites) were on earth in those days, and when these sons of the gods went in to the daughters of men and they bore to them, their children were the ‘mighty men of old,’ the ‘men of renown.’” While hardly “sons of the gods,” the staff and their early descendants were so regarded by the evolutionary mortals of those distant days; even their stature came to be magnified by tradition. This, then, is the origin of the well-nigh universal folk tale of the gods who came down to earth and there with the daughters of men begot an ancient race of heroes. And all this legend became further confused with the race mixtures of the later appearing Adamites in the second garden.
	> 
	> Since the one hundred corporeal members of the . . . staff carried germ plasm of the Andonic human strains, it would naturally be expected that, if they engaged in sexual reproduction, their progeny would altogether resemble the offspring of other Andonite parents. But when the sixty rebels of the staff, the followers of Nod, actually engaged in sexual reproduction, their children proved to be far superior in almost every way to both the Andonite and the Sangik peoples. This unexpected excellence characterized not only physical and intellectual qualities but also spiritual capacities.
	> 
	> These mutant traits appearing in the first Nodite generation resulted from certain changes which had been wrought in the configuration and in the chemical constituents of the inheritance factors of the Andonic germ plasm. These changes . . . caused the chromosomes of the specialized Urantia pattern to reorganize . . . The technique of this germ plasm metamorphosis . . . is not unlike those procedures whereby Urantia scientists modify the germ plasm of plants and animals by the use of X rays.
	> 
	> Thus did the Nodite peoples arise out of certain peculiar and unexpected modifications occurring in the life plasm which had been transferred from the bodies of the Andonite contributors to those of the corporeal staff . . .
	> 
	> . . . The forty-four modified Andonites who followed the staff into rebellion also mated among themselves and made a great contribution to the better strains of the Nodite people.
	> 
	> These two groups, embracing 104 individuals who carried the modified Andonite germ plasm, constitute the ancestry of the Nodites, the eighth race to appear on Urantia. . . .
	> 
	> The pure-line Nodites were a magnificent race, but they gradually mingled with the evolutionary peoples of earth, and before long great deterioration had occurred. Ten thousand years after the rebellion they had lost ground to the point where their average length of life was little more than that of the evolutionary races. [^12]

* *Homo sapiens ultrasapiens*: The Adamites and the Adamsonites, the violet race. (Adamson was the first son of Adam and Eve.)

	> They [Adam and Eve] . . . were a little more than eight feet in height.[^13]

	Statements in *The Urantia Book* about their children indicate that there was a degree of downstepping with succeeding generations. Decrease in age as well as “special senses” (physical and spiritual) are specifically mentioned. Because *The Urantia Book* does not ever speak about the Adamites as being “a race of giants” or anything like that, presumably their stature drifted toward that of *H. sapiens primarius* over time.

	> Adam and Eve were the founders of the violet race of men, the ninth human race to appear on Urantia. Adam and his offspring had blue eyes, and the violet peoples were characterized by fair complexions and light hair color—yellow, red, and brown.
	> 
	> Eve did not suffer pain in childbirth; neither did the early evolutionary races. Only the mixed races produced by the union of evolutionary man with the Nodites and later with the Adamites suffered the severe pangs of childbirth.[^14]
	> 
	> The second Eden was the cradle of civilization for almost thirty thousand years. Here in Mesopotamia the Adamic peoples held forth, sending out their progeny to the ends of the earth, and latterly, as amalgamated with the Nodite and Sangik tribes, were known as the Andites. From this region went those men and women who initiated the doings of historic times, and who have so enormously accelerated cultural progress on Urantia.
	> 
	> . . . [T]he violet race, begin[s with] Adam, about 35,000 B.C., and extend[s] down through its amalgamation with the Nodite and Sangik races, about 15,000 B.C., to form the Andite peoples and on to its final disappearance from the Mesopotamian homelands, about 2000 B.C. [^15]
	> 
	> . . . [T]hirty-five thousand years ago the world at large possessed little culture. Certain centers of civilization existed here and there, but most of Urantia languished in savagery. Racial and cultural distribution was as follows:
	> 
	> 1. *The violet race—Adamites and Adamsonites*. The chief center of Adamite culture was in the second garden, located in the triangle of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; this was indeed the cradle of Occidental and Indian civilizations. The secondary or northern center of the violet race was the Adamsonite headquarters, situated east of the southern shore of the Caspian Sea near the Kopet mountains. From these two centers there went forth to the surrounding lands the culture and life plasm which so immediately quickened all the races.
	> 
	> 2. *Pre-Sumerians and other Nodites*. There were also present in Mesopotamia, near the mouth of the rivers, remnants of the ancient culture of the [pre-rebellion] days . . . With the passing millenniums, this group became thoroughly admixed with the Adamites to the north, but they never entirely lost their Nodite traditions. Various other Nodite groups that had settled in the Levant were, in general, absorbed by the later expanding violet race.
	> 
	> 3. *The Andonites* maintained five or six fairly representative settlements to the north and east of the Adamson headquarters. They were also scattered throughout Turkestan, while isolated islands of them persisted throughout Eurasia, especially in mountainous regions. These aborigines still held the northlands of the Eurasian continent, together with Iceland and Greenland, but they had long since been driven from the plains of Europe by the blue man and from the river valleys of farther Asia by the expanding yellow race.
	> 
	> 4. *The red man* occupied the Americas, having been driven out of Asia over fifty thousand years before the arrival of Adam.
	> 
	> 5. *The yellow race*. The Chinese peoples were well established in control of eastern Asia. Their most advanced settlements were situated to the northwest of modern China in regions bordering on Tibet.
	> 
	> 6. *The blue race*. The blue men were scattered all over Europe, but their better centers of culture were situated in the then fertile valleys of the Mediterranean basin and in northwestern Europe. Neanderthal absorption had greatly retarded the culture of the blue man, but he was otherwise the most aggressive, adventurous, and exploratory of all the evolutionary peoples of Eurasia.
	> 
	> 7. *Pre-Dravidian India*. The complex mixture of races in India—embracing every race on earth, but especially the green, orange, and black—maintained a culture slightly above that of the outlying regions.
	> 
	> 8. *The Sahara civilization*. The superior elements of the indigo race had their most progressive settlements in what is now the great Sahara desert. This indigoblack group carried extensive strains of the submerged orange and green races.
	> 
	> 9. *The Mediterranean basin*. The most highly blended race outside of India occupied what is now the Mediterranean basin. Here blue men from the north and Saharans from the south met and mingled with Nodites and Adamites from the east.
	> 
	> This was the picture of the world prior to the beginnings of the great expansions of the violet race, about twenty-five thousand years ago. . . . [^16]

* *Homo sapiens supersapiens*: The Andites.

	> After becoming established in the second garden on the Euphrates, Adam elected to leave behind as much of his life plasm as possible to benefit the world after his death. Accordingly, Eve was made the head of a commission of twelve on race improvement, and before Adam died this commission had selected 1,682 of the highest type of women on Urantia, and these women were impregnated with the Adamic life plasm. Their children all grew up to maturity except 112, so that the world, in this way, was benefited by the addition of 1,570 superior men and women. Though these candidate mothers were selected from all the surrounding tribes and represented most of the races on earth, the majority were chosen from the highest strains of the Nodites, and they constituted the early beginnings of the mighty Andite race. These children were born and reared in the tribal surroundings of their respective mothers. [^17]

	> 4. THE ANDITES
	> 
	> The Andite races were the primary blends of the pure-line violet race and the Nodites plus the evolutionary peoples. In general, Andites should be thought of as having a far greater percentage of Adamic blood than the modern races. In the main, the term Andite is used to designate those peoples whose racial inheritance was from one-eighth to one-sixth violet. Modern Urantians, even the northern white races, contain much less than this percentage of the blood of Adam.
	> 
	> The earliest Andite peoples took origin in the regions adjacent to Mesopotamia more than twenty-five thousand years ago and consisted of a blend of the Adamites and Nodites. The second garden was surrounded by concentric circles of diminishing violet blood, and it was on the periphery of this racial melting pot that the Andite race was born. Later on, when the migrating Adamites and Nodites entered the then fertile regions of Turkestan, they soon blended with the superior inhabitants, and the resultant race mixture extended the Andite type northward.
	> 
	> The Andites were the best all-round human stock to appear on Urantia since the days of the pure-line violet peoples. They embraced most of the highest types of the surviving remnants of the Adamite and Nodite races and, later, some of the best strains of the yellow, blue, and green men.
	> 
	> These early Andites were not Aryan; they were pre-Aryan. They were not white; they were pre-white. They were neither an Occidental nor an Oriental people. But it is Andite inheritance that gives to the polyglot mixture of the so-called white races that generalized homogeneity which has been called Caucasoid.
	> 
	> The purer strains of the violet race had retained the Adamic tradition of peaceseeking, which explains why the earlier race movements had been more in the nature of peaceful migrations. But as the Adamites united with the Nodite stocks, who were by this time a belligerent race, their Andite descendants became, for their day and age, the most skillful and sagacious militarists ever to live on Urantia. Thenceforth the movements of the Mesopotamians grew increasingly military in character and became more akin to actual conquests.
	> 
	> 5. THE ANDITE MIGRATIONS
	> 
	> For twenty thousand years the culture of the second garden persisted, but it experienced a steady decline until about 15,000 B.C., when the regeneration of the Sethite priesthood and the leadership of Amosad inaugurated a brilliant era. The massive waves of civilization which later spread over Eurasia immediately followed the great renaissance of the Garden consequent upon the extensive union of the Adamites with the surrounding mixed Nodites to form the Andites.
	> 
	> These Andites inaugurated new advances throughout Eurasia and North Africa. From Mesopotamia through Sinkiang the Andite culture was dominant, and the steady migration toward Europe was continuously offset by new arrivals from Mesopotamia. But it is hardly correct to speak of the Andites as a race in Mesopotamia proper until near the beginning of the terminal migrations of the mixed descendants of Adam. By this time even the races in the second garden had become so blended that they could no longer be considered Adamites.
	> 
	> The civilization of Turkestan was constantly being revived and refreshed by the newcomers from Mesopotamia, especially by the later Andite cavalrymen. The so-called Aryan mother tongue was in process of formation in the highlands of Turkestan; it was a blend of the Andonic dialect of that region with the language of the Adamsonites and later Andites. Many modern languages are derived from this early speech of these central Asian tribes who conquered Europe, India, and the upper stretches of the Mesopotamian plains. This ancient language gave the Occidental tongues all of that similarity which is called Aryan.
	> 
	> By 12,000 B.C. three quarters of the Andite stock of the world was resident in northern and eastern Europe, and when the later and final exodus from Mesopotamia took place, sixty-five per cent of these last waves of emigration entered Europe.
	> 
	> The Andites not only migrated to Europe but to northern China and India, while many groups penetrated to the ends of the earth as missionaries, teachers, and traders. They contributed considerably to the northern groups of the Saharan Sangik peoples. But only a few teachers and traders ever penetrated farther south in Africa than the headwaters of the Nile. Later on, mixed Andites and Egyptians followed down both the east and west coasts of Africa well below the equator, but they did not reach Madagascar.
	> 
	> These Andites were the so-called Dravidian and later Aryan conquerors of India; and their presence in central Asia greatly upstepped the ancestors of the Turanians. Many of this race journeyed to China by way of both Sinkiang and Tibet and added desirable qualities to the later Chinese stocks. From time to time small groups made their way into Japan, Formosa, the East Indies, and southern China, though very few entered southern China by the coastal route.
	> 
	> One hundred and thirty-two of this race, embarking in a fleet of small boats from Japan, eventually reached South America and by intermarriage with the natives of the Andes established the ancestry of the later rulers of the Incas. They crossed the Pacific by easy stages, tarrying on the many islands they found along the way. The islands of the Polynesian group were both more numerous and larger then than now, and these Andite sailors, together with some who followed them, biologically modified the native groups in transit. Many flourishing centers of civilization grew up on these now submerged lands as a result of Andite penetration. Easter Island was long a religious and administrative center of one of these lost groups. But of the Andites who navigated the Pacific of long ago none but the one hundred and thirty-two ever reached the mainland of the Americas.
	> 
	> The migratory conquests of the Andites continued on down to their final dispersions, from 8000 to 6000 B.C. As they poured out of Mesopotamia, they continuously depleted the biologic reserves of their homelands while markedly strengthening the surrounding peoples. And to every nation to which they journeyed, they contributed humor, art, adventure, music, and manufacture. They were skillful domesticators of animals and expert agriculturists. For the time being, at least, their presence usually improved the religious beliefs and moral practices of the older races. And so the culture of Mesopotamia quietly spread out over Europe, India, China, northern Africa, and the Pacific Islands. [^186]
	> 
	> 6. THE LAST ANDITE DISPERSIONS
	> 
	> The last three waves of Andites poured out of Mesopotamia between 8000 and 6000 B.C. These three great waves of culture were forced out of Mesopotamia by the pressure of the hill tribes to the east and the harassment of the plainsmen of the west. The inhabitants of the Euphrates valley and adjacent territory went forth in their final exodus in several directions:
	> 
	> Sixty-five per cent entered Europe by the Caspian Sea route to conquer and amalgamate with the newly appearing white races—the blend of the blue men and the earlier Andites.
	> 
	> Ten per cent, including a large group of the Sethite priests, moved eastward through the Elamite highlands to the Iranian plateau and Turkestan. Many of their descendants were later driven into India with their Aryan brethren from the regions to the north.
	> 
	> Ten per cent of the Mesopotamians turned eastward in their northern trek, entering Sinkiang, where they blended with the Andite-yellow inhabitants. The majority of the able offspring of this racial union later entered China and contributed much to the immediate improvement of the northern division of the yellow race.
	> 
	>  Ten per cent of these fleeing Andites made their way across Arabia and entered Egypt.
	> 
	> Five per cent of the Andites, the very superior culture of the coastal district about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates who had kept themselves free from intermarriage with the inferior neighboring tribesmen, refused to leave their homes. This group represented the survival of many superior Nodite and Adamite strains.
	> 
	> The Andites had almost entirely evacuated this region by 6000 B.C., though their descendants, largely mixed with the surrounding Sangik races and the Andonites of Asia Minor, were there to give battle to the northern and eastern invaders at a much later date.
	> 
	> The cultural age of the second garden was terminated by the increasing infiltration of the surrounding inferior stocks. Civilization moved westward to the Nile and the Mediterranean islands, where it continued to thrive and advance long after its fountainhead in Mesopotamia had deteriorated. And this unchecked influx of inferior peoples prepared the way for the later conquest of all Mesopotamia by the northern barbarians who drove out the residual strains of ability. Even in later years the cultured residue still resented the presence of these ignorant and uncouth invaders. [^18]

* *Homo sapiens sapiens*: Modern blended peoples, the various degrees of admixture between *H. sapiens supersapiens*, *H. sapiens* and *H. erectus prosapiens*. The following quote provides the entirety of “The Mixed Races” section:

	> As contact is made with the dawn of historic times, all of Eurasia, northern Africa, and the Pacific Islands is overspread with the composite races of mankind. And these races of today have resulted from a blending and reblending of the five basic human stocks of Urantia.
	> 
	> Each of the Urantia races was identified by certain distinguishing physical characteristics. The Adamites and Nodites were long-headed; the Andonites were broad-headed. The Sangik races were medium-headed, with the yellow and blue men tending to broad-headedness. The blue races, when mixed with the Andonite stock, were decidedly broad-headed. The secondary Sangiks were medium- to long-headed.
	> 
	> Although these skull dimensions are serviceable in deciphering racial origins, the skeleton as a whole is far more dependable. In the early development of the Urantia races there were originally five distinct types of skeletal structure:
	> 
	> 1. Andonic, Urantia aborigines.
	> 
	> 2. Primary Sangik, red, yellow, and blue.
	> 
	> 3. Secondary Sangik, orange, green, and indigo.
	> 
	> 4. Nodites, descendants of the Dalamatians.
	> 
	> 5. Adamites, the violet race.
	> 
	> As these five great racial groups extensively intermingled, continual mixture tended to obscure the Andonite type by Sangik hereditary dominance. The Lapps and the Eskimos are blends of Andonite and Sangik-blue races. Their skeletal structures come the nearest to preserving the aboriginal Andonic type. But the Adamites and the Nodites have become so admixed with the other races that they can be detected only as a generalized Caucasoid order.
	> 
	> In general, therefore, as the human remains of the last twenty thousand years are unearthed, it will be impossible clearly to distinguish the five original types. Study of such skeletal structures will disclose that mankind is now divided into approximately three classes:
	> 
	> 1. *The Caucasoid* —the Andite blend of the Nodite and Adamic stocks, further modified by primary and (some) secondary Sangik admixture and by considerable Andonic crossing. The Occidental white races, together with some Indian and Turanian peoples, are included in this group. The unifying factor in this division is the greater or lesser proportion of Andite inheritance.
	> 
	> 2. *The Mongoloid*—the primary Sangik type, including the original red, yellow, and blue races. The Chinese and Amerinds belong to this group. In Europe the Mongoloid type has been modified by secondary Sangik and Andonic mixture; still more by Andite infusion. The Malayan and other Indonesian peoples are included in this classification, though they contain a high percentage of secondary Sangik blood.
	> 
	> 3. *The Negroid*—the secondary Sangik type, which originally included the orange, green, and indigo races. This is the type best illustrated by the Negro, and it will be found through Africa, India, and Indonesia wherever the secondary Sangik races located.
	> 
	> In North China there is a certain blending of Caucasoid and Mongoloid types; in the Levant the Caucasoid and Negroid have intermingled; in India, as in South America, all three types are represented. And the skeletal characteristics of the three surviving types still persist and help to identify the later ancestry of presentday human races.[^19]

	Taxonomical subcategories for these three divisions would be incongruent with *The Urantia Book*’s use of the word “approximate” to describe them and numerous other statements about racial mixing that has occurred at this point in human history. Additionally, *The Urantia Book* states:

	> [I]t is a fallacy to presume to classify the white peoples as Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. There has been altogether too much blending to permit such a grouping. At one time there was a fairly well-defined division of the white race into such classes, but widespread intermingling has since occurred, and it is no longer possible to identify these distinctions with any clarity. Even in 3000 B.C. the ancient social groups were no more of one race than are the present inhabitants of North America. [^20]

* *Homo sapiens neanderthalensis*: *H. sapiens* (the Sangik races) mixed with *H. neanderthalensis prosapiens* (the superior Badanon tribes that emerged 850,000 years ago). This blending occurred approximately 300,000 years ago and is what taxonomy currently designates *H. neanderthalensis* or *H. sapiens neanderthalensis*. What is currently designated *H. sapiens sapiens*—a development in human evolution occurring approximately 200,000 years ago that began with the Nodites—in this Urantia Book-based taxonomy would be referred to as *H. sapiens transerectus*.

* *Homo heidelbergensis prosapiens*: The fossil record to date combined with information found in numerous parts of *The Urantia Book* indicates that *H. heidelbergensis* is likely the result of a mutative evolutionary upstepping similar to what occurred with the jump from *H. neanderthalensis prosapiens* to *H. sapiens*. The difference is that the *H. neaderthalensis prosapiens* that mutated into *H. heidelbergensis* had a lesser initial genetic quality than the *H. neanderthalensis prosapiens* that gave rise to *H. sapiens*. The jump fell short of a *H. sapiens*- type mutation that produces the colored races. It seems that they were probably largely wiped out and somewhat absorbed by some combination of interactions with H. neanderthalensis (improved Andonites) and *H. sapiens*.
