Jo. i. I-18; Phil. ii. 5-11.

Is not this a singular title under which St. John introduces the Lord Jesus Christ at the beginning of his peerless Gospel ? What does it mean ?

Our Christian faith is that our Blessed Saviour, while truly human, was not a mere man. He was the Eternal Son of God who left His glory and made Himself one with us, that He might bear the burden of the world’s sin and sorrow and suffering. This is the miracle of the Incarnation; and when St. John wrote his Gospel at Ephesus about the close of the first century, it was difficult for men, whether heathen or Jews, to believe it. What made it so difficult ?

As regards the heathen : their philosophers all down the ages had taught them that matter is essentially and necessarily evil; and the problem thus presented to their minds was how a pure God could have to do with a material and therefore impure world in the way of creation or providence or redemption, and, above all, how the Eternal Son of God could become incarnate and wear a material body of sinful flesh. Hence it was very difficult for educated heathen like the people of Ephesus, that famous centre of learning, to accept the Gospel of the Incarnation; and in St. John’s day there appeared a Christian teacher who propounded a theory which seemed to him a solution of the problem. His name was Cerinthus, and he <span id="p4"><sup><small>[ p. 4 ]</small></sup></span> drew a distinction between Jesus and Christ. Jesus he regarded as a mere man, a wise teacher but only human, and Christ as an angelic being who at the Baptism of Jesus descended upon him in the likeness of a dove and kept company with him all the three years of his ministry, endowing him with supernatural wisdom and power to work miracles. Then at the close the Christ left him, and it was the human Jesus who was nailed to the Cross and suffered and died. Cerinthus meant no harm. His theory was to his mind a sincere attempt to solve a real problem; yet it was a fatal heresy, and St. John stoutly opposed it and denounced him as an enemy of the truth. And so indeed he was ; for his doctrine was a denial of a real incarnation.

For the Jews the problem was hardly less acute. Their dominant conception was, in philosophic phrase, the divine transcendence. God was for them “the high and lofty One that inhabiteth Eternity, Is ’ lvn * I5 ’ whose name is Holy”—too high, as it seemed, for the children of men to reach Him, and too holy to endure contact with human defilement; and the problem was how the gulf between God and man could be bridged. And what was the solution of the Rabbis ? There are numerous Old Testament passages which speak of “The Word of the Lord,” figuratively personalising it: for example, that formula wherewith the Prophets introduce their messages, “The Word of the Lord came unto me, saying,” as though it were His messenger, the bearer of His revelation. Here, thought the Rabbis, was a mediator between God and the world—His Word, a glorious angelic being, less than God and therefore capable of earthly <span id="p5"><sup><small>[ p. 5 ]</small></sup></span> contact, greater than man and therefore fit to approach God. Shortly before St. John's day there arose at Alexandria a large-hearted and widely influential Jewish teacher named Philo, who thought to reconcile Jews and Gentiles by interpreting Jewish theology in terms of Greek philosophy. He elaborated the Rabbinical doctrine, conceiving “the Divine Word " as the agent in creation and revelation, and designating Him " the First-born," “the Image of God," “the High Priest," “the Archetypal Man "—a conception which approaches very near the Christian idea of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Such were the thoughts which filled the minds of men in those days ; and fantastic as they appear nowadays, they expressed a profound instinct of the human soul—its yearning for access to God and fellowship with Him. St. John recognised how this yearning is met by the Incarnation, the union of God and humanity in His Eternal Son, the Archetypal Man, the Image in which man was created and to which he will eventually be conformed by redeeming grace. And so he prefaces his Gospel with this announcement: “Here is the satisfaction which your hearts are craving. Here is the Mediator, the true Word. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh, and we beheld His glory."

And thus no mortal can tell the complete story of the life of our Blessed Lord. For He was the Eternal Son of God who became flesh for us men and for our redemption, and His birth was not the beginning of His life nor was His death its end. It is indeed possible to recount His progress through the world, but <span id="p6"><sup><small>[ p. 6 ]</small></sup></span> this is not the whole story. It is but a narrow segment of an infinite circle, a moment of His Eternity. His actual career knows neither beginning of days nor end of years. It sweeps in a magnificent circuit from the ageless Glory down to this low earth, the arena of His redemptive conflict, and back to the Eternal Throne, where He is throned evermore at God's right hand. All that is given us is to tell the story of His brief earthly sojourn,

“How He walked here, the shadow of Him Love,
The speech of Him soft Music, and His step
A Benediction,”

continually realising in the telling of it who He was and is and wherefore He came, and reverently relying on the present aid of the Holy Spirit, His Witness and Interpreter.
