[^1071] The Heavenly Sovereign's august years were forty-nine. Augustness mausoleum est in privatis partibus Montis Unebi. [^1072]

Now the younger brother, His Augustness Tarashi-hiko-kuni-oshi-bito \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the Empire.

So His Augustness Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-futo-ni \[159\] \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the Empire. The heavenly Sovereign's august years were one hundred and twenty-three.

<span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span>

His Augustness Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-futo-ni dwelt at the Palace of Ihodo at Kuruda, [^1111] and ruled the Empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded Her Augustness Princess Kuhashi, [^1112] daughter of Ohome, [^1113] ancestor of the Departmental Lords of Tohochi, [^1114] and begot an august child: His Augustness Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-kuni-kuru [^1115] (one Deity). Again he wedded Princess Chiji-haya-ma-waka of Kasuga, [^1116] and begot an august child: Her Augustness Princess Chiji-haya [^1117] (one Deity). Again wedding Her Augustness Princess Oho-yamato-kuni-are, [^1118] he begot august children: Her Augustness Yamato-to-mo-so-bime, [^1119] next His Augustness Hiko-sashi-kata-wake; [^1120] next His \[160\] Augustness Hiko-isa-seri-biko, [^1121] another name for whom is His Augustness Oho-biki-tsu-hiko: next Yamato-to-bi-haya-waka-ya-hime [^1122] (four Deities).

The august children of this Heavenly Sovereign \[numbered\] in all eleven Deities (five kings and three queens). So His Augustness Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-kuni-kuru \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the Empire. The two Deities His Augustness Oho-kibi-tsu-hiko and His Augustness Waka-take-kibi-tsu-hiko together set sacred jars [^1126] at the front [^1127] of the River Hi [^1128] in Hari-ma; [^1129] and, making Harima the mouth of the road, [^1130] subdued and pacified the Land of Kibi. So His Augustness \[161\] Oho-kibi-tsu-hiko (was the ancestor of the Grandees of Kamu-tsu-michi in Kibi) [^1131] The next, His Augustness Waka-hiko-take-kiki-tsu-hiko (was the ancestor of the Grandees of Shimo-tsu-michi in <span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span> Kibi [^1132] and of the Grandees of Kasa [^1133]).

## Footnotes


[^1059]: 189:1b In Kahachi: _uki-ana_ signifies “floating hole,” _Kata-shiha_ is said to signify “hard rock” (_kata-iha_); but this seems doubtful, and the reading given by the characters in the text is not _Kata-shiha_, but _Kata-shiho_.

[^1060]: 189:2b _I.e._, Princess of Akuto, or Akuta,—for the latter form of the name is more common. There exists a place thus called in Settsu. The derivation of the word is obscure.

[^1061]: 189:3b _Agata-nushi-Haye_. The reading of this name is obscure, and its, derivation uncertain.

[^1062]: 190:4 _Irone_ signifies “elder brother” or “elder sister.” The rest of the compound is obscure.

[^1064]: 190:5 The first three elements of the compound signify “Great Yamato Prince.” The last two are obscure, but Motowori identifies _suki_ (see Note 3 to preceding Sect.)

[^1063]: 190:6 _I.e._, “Prince of Shiki”; so called, it is supposed, with reference to the place of residence of his grandfather.

[^1065]: 190:7 The character thus translated is ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/19000.jpg), of which “King ”is the original and proper signification. To judge by some other passages in the ancient histories, it had not yet in the 8th century altogether paled to p. 191 the lesser meaning of “prince,” which has belonged to it in later times when denoting Japanese personages. It is still, as far as possible, used to denote the rulers of all countries excepting Japan, the zealous admirers of the native literature and institutions even designating by it the Emperor of China, who, one would have thought, had a special right to the more Honorific title of Emperor, which his own subjects were the first to invent. On the whole, therefore, “King ”seems to be the most appropriate rendering. The characters ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/19100.jpg) are, by analogy, rendered “Queen.”

[^1066]: 190:8 The text has “descendant”; but it must here be corrupt or at least faulty, as may be seen by the omission of the proper name.

[^1067]: 190:9 _Iga no Suchi no inaki_. The etymology of _Iga_ and that of _Suchi_ are alike obscure. See however Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXI, p. 13, for the traditional derivation of the former. It is the name of a small province which in very ancient times formed part of the province of Ise.

[^1068]: 190:10 _Nabari no inaki_. Nabari is in Iga. The name signifies, “hiding.”

[^1069]: 190:11 _Minu no inaki_. Minu, not to be confounded with the province of the same name, is a place in Iga. The name probably signifies “three moors.”

[^1070]: 190:12 _I.e._, the other child.

[^1071]: 190:13 Motowori reads _Chichitsumi_. In any case, the name remains obscure.

[^1072]: 190:14 For Ahaji see Sect. VI, Note 3. _Mi-wi_ signifies “august well,” and the name is traced to the custom of bringing water from the Island of Ahaji for use in the Imperial Palace, as mentioned in Sect. CXXIX of the present work, and elsewhere in the early literature.

[^1073]: 190:15 _Irone_ means “elder sister.” _Hahe_ is of uncertain import, it being written with completely different characters in the two histories.

[^1074]: 190:16 _Oho-yamato-kuni-are-hime-no-mikoto_. _Ono-yamato-kuni_ signifies “the land of Great Yamato,” and _hime_ signifies “princess ”or “maiden.” Motowori suggests that _are_, which is an obscure word, may signify “pure.”

[^1075]: 190:17 _Irodo_ signifies “younger sister.” For _hahe_ _conf_. Note 15.

[^1076]: 190:18 _Scil_. in interiori parte montis, _e.g._ in spelunca. Motowori explains the use of the term by reference to such words as foot, where the name of a portion of the human body is applied to a mountain. In Japanese there are others besides _ashi_ (“foot”), such as _itadaki_, _hara_ and _koshi_.

[^1077]: 192:1 p. 192 Karu, which still remains as a village in the province of Yamato, was famous down to the early historical days of Japan, being often mentioned by the poets. The derivation of the name is quite uncertain. _Sakahi-wo_ probably signifies “boundary mound.”

[^1078]: 192:2 _Futo-ma-wakes-hime-no-mikoto_. The compound signifies “vast, true, and young princess.”

[^1079]: 192:3 _Ihibi-hime-no-mikoto_. The name seems to signify “rice-sun-princess.”

[^1080]: 192:4 See Sect. LV, Note 3.

[^1081]: 192:5 The import of this name is obscure.

[^1082]: 192:6 _i.e._, perhaps “rudder prince.”

[^1083]: 192:7 _Chinu no wake_. For Chinu see Sect. XLIV, Notes 35 and 36.

[^1084]: 192:8 _Tajima no Take no wake_. Motowori tells us that no mention of any place called Take in the province of Tajima is to be found in any other book.

[^1085]: 192:9 _Ashiwi no inaki_. The same remark applies to this name as to the last. The two “gentile names” here mentioned are equally unknown except from this passage.

[^1086]: 192:10 _Unebi-yama no Manago-dani_. It is in Yamato, and is now called Masago. The name signifies “a sandy place, or desert.”

[^1087]: 193:1 p. 193 In Yamato. The name of Waki-no-kami is of uncertain derivation. In the “Chronicles” the Emperor Kō-shō is said to have “dwelt at the palace of Ikegokoro at Waki-no-kami.” For Kadzuraki see Sect. LV, Note 1.

[^1088]: 193:2 _Yoso-taho-bime-no-mikoto_. Here written phonetically, this name appears in the “Chronicles ”written with characters to which the signification of “perfectly ornamented princess” should be attributed.

[^1089]: 193:3 The signification of this name is obscure, but it seems to be connected in some way with that of the other sister.

[^1090]: 193:4 _Wohari no murazhi_.

[^1091]: 193:5 _I.e._, heavenly great perfect prince.”

[^1092]: 193:6 _I.e._, “great Yamato perfect prince, country great man.” This name appears in an abbreviated form in the next sentence.

[^1093]: 193:7 p. 194_Kasuga na omi_. Kasuga is a celebrated place in the province of Yamato. The name is of uncertain origin, though the “Catalogue of Family Names” gives a story referring it to _Kasu gaki_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/19400.jpg)), _i.e._, “lees fence.” The curious combination of characters with which Kasuga is written,— ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/19401.jpg)—may be traced to the Pillow-Word _haru-hi no_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/19402.jpg)) which was not unnaturally prefixed to a name which so much resembled the Verb _kasumu_, “to be misty.”

[^1094]: 193:8 _Ohoyake no omi_. Ohoyake is a place in Yamato. The name signifies “great granary.”

[^1095]: 193:9 _Ahata no omi_. Ahata is a place in Yamashiro. The name signifies “millet-field.”

[^1096]: 193:10 _Wonu no omi_. Wonu is a place in Afumi. The name signifies “little moor.”

[^1097]: 193:11 _Kakinnomoto-uo-omi_. _Kaki-no-moto_ signifies “at the bottom of the persimmon-tree,” and the name is said by the compiler of the “Catalogue of Family Names” to have been granted to this family in allusion to a persimmon-tree which grew near their gate. This name was rendered illustrious in the eighth century by the poet Kakinomoto Hitomaro (See the present writer's “Classical Poetry of the Japanese,” p. 217 of seq.).

[^1098]: 193:12 _Ichihiwi no omi_. Ichihiwi is in Yamato. The name may signify “oak-well.”

[^1099]: 193:13 _Ohosaka no omi_. Ohosaka is a place in Bingo. The name signifies “great hill, or pass.”

[^1100]: 193:14 _Ana no omi_. Ana is a department in Bingo. The name signifies “hole” or “cave.”

[^1101]: 193:15 _Taki no omi_. Taki is a district in Tamba. The name, which is a common one in Japan, means “water-falls.”

[^1102]: 193:16 _Haguri no omi_. Haguri is a district in Wohari. The signification of the name is obscure.

[^1103]: 193:17 _Chita no omi_. Chita is a district in Wohari. The signification of the name is obscure.

[^1104]: 193:18 _Musa no omi_. Mudza is a district in Kadzusa. The name seems to be a corruption of the Chinese words ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/19403.jpg), “warlike archer.”

[^1105]: 193:19 _Tsunuyama no omi_. The family, the place, and the signification of the name are alike obscure.

[^1106]: 193:20 _Ise no Ihitaka no kimi_. Ihitaka is the name of a district, and is traced to the signification of “abundant rice.”

[^1107]: 193:21 _Ichishi no kimi_. Ichishi is a district in Ise. The signification of the name is obscure.

[^1108]: 193:22 p. 195 _Chika tsu Afumi no kuni-no-miyatsuko_. For Chika-tsu-Afumi see Sect. XXIX, Note 20.

[^1109]: 193:23 In Yamato. The signification of the name is obscure.

[^1110]: 195:1 In Yamato. _Muro_ signifies “cave” or “pit.” _Aki-dzu-shima_, “the Island of the Dragon-Fly,” is frequently used as an alternative name of Japan (see Sect. V, Note 26). See also the Emperor Yū-riyaku's song given in Sect. CLVI.

[^1111]: 195:2 _Oshika-hime-no-mikoto_. The name Oshika, which is obscure, appears in the “Chronicles” under the form of _Oshi_, which has generally been interpreted by Motowori (whom the translator follows) as a corruption of _ohoshi_, “great.” This version of the name makes it harmonize with that of the Princess's father.

[^1112]: 195:3 See Sect. LX, Note 11.

[^1113]: 195:4 This name seems to signify “Great Yamato's Lord Prince, the Vast Jewel.”

[^1114]: 195:5 _Tamade no woka_. In Yamato. For this name see Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXI, pp. 37-38.

[^1115]: 196:1 p. 197 In Yamato. _Iho-do_ signifies “hut door.” _Kuru-da_ (_Kuroda_ would be the more natural reading) signifies “black rice-field.”

[^1116]: 196:2 _Kuhashi-hime-no-mikoto_. The name signifies “beautiful princess.”

[^1117]: 196:3 This seems to have been originally not a personal name, but the name of a place in Wohari.

[^1118]: 196:4 _To-hochi no agata-mushi_. Tohochi is a district in Yamato. The name seems to signify “ten marts.”

[^1119]: 196:5 This name signifies “great Yamato's lord prince who rules the land.”

[^1120]: 196:6 _Kasuga no-chiji-haya-ma-waka-hime_. This name probably signifies “the thousand-fold brilliant truly young princess of Kasuga.” For Kasuga see Sect, LVIII, Note 7.

[^1121]: 196:7 _Chiji-haya-hime-no-mikoto_, _i.e._, probably “thousand-fold brilliant princess.”

[^1122]: 196:8 _Oho-yamato-kuni-are-hime-no-mikoto_. See Sect. LVI, Note 16.

[^1123]: 196:9 Motowori assigns to this name the signification of “Yamato's hundred thousand-fold illustrious princess,” and has a very long note on the subject in Vol. XXI, p. 42, _et seq_.

[^1124]: 196:10 The signification of this name is not clear.

[^1125]: 196:11 _I.e._, “prince valorously advancing prince.” The alternative name signifies “Great Prince of Kibi,” and both refer to his conquest of the province of Kibi as related a little further on in this Section. Motowori gives good reasons for supposing that _Oho-kibi-no-moro-susumi_, _i.e._ “He Who Completely Advances in Great Kibi,” is but another form of the same name, erroneously inserted in the account of the preceding reign (see Sect, LIX, Note 3).

[^1126]: 196:12 _I.e._, perhaps “Yamato's hundred-fold wondrous brilliant young ornamental Princess.” The name resembles that of the elder sister.

[^1127]: 196:13 For this and the next following names see Sect. LVI, Notes 17 and 16 respectively.

[^1128]: 196:14 p. 198 This name is obscure, and differs from that given in the parallel passage of the “Chronicles,” where we read Sashima. The latter sounds more authentic.

[^1129]: 196:15 _I.e._, “the young prince the brave prince of Kibi.” This name refers to his conquest of Kibi, as related a few lines further on.

[^1130]: 196:16 _I.e._, earthenware jars of a moderate size, probably intended to hold the rice-liquor offered to the gods, Being easily broken, they were planted in the ground up to a certain height.

[^1131]: 196:17 The probable meaning of this peculiar expression is “a bend in the river,”

[^1132]: 196:18 Written with the character ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/19800.jpg), “ice,” which may however be only phonetic. No river of this name is anywhere else mentioned as flowing through the province of Harima, and one is tempted to suppose that there is some confusion with the celebrated river Hi, which figures so frequently in the Idzumo cycle of legends.

[^1133]: 196:19 One of the central provinces of Japan, on the northern shores of the Inland Sea. Some derive the name from _hagi-hara_, “lespedeza moor,” while others, connect it with _hari_, a “needle,” Neither etymology has much to recommend it.

[^1134]: 196:20 _I.e._, “their point of departure.” It must also be remembered that “road ”came to have the sense of “circuit ”or “province,” so that we might translate this phrase by “the commencement of the circuit.” _Conf_. such denominations as _Koshi no michi no kuchi_, _Koshi no michi no naka_, and _Koshi no michi no shiri_ for what are in modern parlance the provinces of Echizen, Etchiū and Echigo. The region nearest to the capital was called the mouth, while equally graphic designations were bestowed on the more remote districts. It was, as we learn by comparison with a passage in the history of the reign of the Emperor Su-jin (see Sect. LXVI, Note 13), customary thus to plant earthenware jars in the earth at the point whence an army started on an expedition, this being considered a means of invoking upon it the blessing of the gods. Not only so, but down to the Middle Ages travellers in general were in the habit of worshipping at the shrine of the god of roads. For “road” in the sense of “circuit,” “province,” or “administrative division ”see Sect. LXVI, Note 2.
