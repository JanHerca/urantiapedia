## SECT. CXVI.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN (PART XIII.—THE YOUTH-OF-THE-GLOW-ON-THE-AUTUMN-MOUNTAINS AND THE YOUTH-OF-THE-HAZE-ON-THE-SPRING-MOUNTAINS).

So this Deity had a daughter whose name was the Deity Maiden-of-Idzushi. [^1975] So eighty Deities wished to \[262\] obtain this Maiden-of-Idzushi in marriage, but none of them could do so. [^1976] Hereupon there were two Deities, brothers, of whom the elder was called the Youth-of-the-Glow-on-the-Autumn-Mountains, [^1977] and the younger was named the Youth-of-the-Haze-on-the-Spring-Mountains. [^1978] So the elder brother said to the younger brother: “Though I beg for [^1979] the Maiden of Idzushi, I cannot obtain her in marriage. Wilt thou \[be able\] to obtain her?” He answered, saying: “I will easily obtain her.” Then the elder brother said: “If thou shalt obtain this maiden, I will take off my upper and lower garments, and distil liquor in a jar of my own height, [^1980] and prepare all the things of the mountains and of the rivers [^1981] \[and give them to thee\] in payment of the wager.” Then the younger brother told his mother everything that the elder brother had said. Forthwith the mother, having taken wistaria-fibre, wove and sewed in the space of a single night an upper garment and trowsers, and also socks and boots, and likewise made a bow and arrows, and clothed him in this upper garment, trowsers, \[263\] etc., made him take the bow and arrows, and sent him to the maiden's house, where both his apparel and the bow and arrows all turned into wistaria-blossoms. Thereupon the Youth-of-the-Haze-on-the-Spring-Mountains hung up the bow and arrows in the maiden's privy. Then, when the Maiden-of-Idzushi, thinking the blossoms strange, brought them \[home, the Youth-of-the-Haze-on-the-Spring-Mountains\] <span id="p327"><sup><small>[ p. 327 ]</small></sup></span> followed behind the maiden into the house, and forthwith wedded her. So she gave birth to a child. [^1982] Then he spoke to his elder brother, saying: “I have obtained the Mayden-of-Idzushi.” Thereupon the elder brother, vexed that the younger brother should have wedded her, did not pay the things he had wagered. Then when \[the younger brother\] complained to his mother, his august parent replied, saying: “During my august life the Deities indeed are to be well imitated; moreover it must be because he imitates mortal men [^1983] that he does not pay those things.” Forthwith, in her anger with her elder child, she took a jointed bamboo [^1984] from an island in the River Idzushi, and made a coarse basket with eight holes, [^1985] and took stones from the river, and mixing them with brine, wrapped them in the leaves of the bamboo [^1986] and caused this curse to be spoken: [^1987] “Like unto the becoming green of these bamboo-leaves, \[do thou\] become green and wither! \[264\] Again, like unto the flowing and ebbing of this brine [^1988] \[do thou\] flow and ebb! Again, like unto the sinking of these stones, \[do thou\] sink and be prostrate! ”Having caused this curse to be spoken, she placed \[the basket\] over the smoke. [^1989] Therefore the elder brother dried up, withered, sickened, and lay prostrate [^1990] for the space of eight years. So on the elder brother entreating his august parent with lamentations and fears, she forthwith caused the curse to be reversed. [^1991] Thereupon his body became sound [^1992] as it had been before. (This is the origin of the term “a divine wager payment.”) [^1993]

## SECT. CXVII.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN (PART XVI.—GENEALOGIES).

Again this Heavenly Sovereign Homuda's [^1994] august child King Wake-nuke-futa-mata wedded his mother's younger sister Momo-shiki-iro-be, [^1995] another name for whom was Her Augustness Oto-hime-ma-wake-hime, [^1996] and begot children: Oho-iratsuko, [^1997] another name for whom \[265\] was King Ohohodo; [^1998] next her Augustness Osaka-no-oho-naka-tsu-hime: [^1999] <span id="p330"><sup><small>[ p. 330 ]</small></sup></span> next Tawi-no-naka-tsu-hime; [^2000] next Tamiya-no-naka-tsu-hime; [^2001] next Fujihara-no-koto-fushi-no-ira-tsume; [^2002] next Queen Torime; [^2003] next King Sane. [^2004] (Seven Kings (and Queens). [^2005]) So King Oho-hodo (was the ancestor of the Dukes of Mikuni, [^2006] the Dukes of Hata, [^2007] the Dukes of Okinaga, [^2008] the Dukes of Sakahito of Sakata, [^2009] the Dukes of Yamaji, [^2010] the Dukes of \[266\] Meta in Tsukushi, [^2011] and the Dukes of Fuse.) [^2012] Again King Netori wedded his younger half-sister the Lady Mihara, and begot children: King Naka-tsu-hiko; [^2013] next King Iwa-shiha [^2014] (Two Kings.) Again the child of King Kata-shiha [^2015] was King Kuni. [^2016]

## Footnotes


[^1980]: 326:1 p. 327 _Idzushi-wotome no kami_.

[^1981]: 326:2 Literally “eighty Deities wished to obtain this Maiden of Idzushi, but none could wed (her).” But the sense is that given in the translation.

[^1982]: 326:3 p. 328 _Ahi yama no shita-bi-wotoko_. The explanation of the name is that given by Motowori (following Mabuchi), who sees in it a reference to the ruddy brilliance of the leaves, which is so marked a feature of the Japanese woods in autumn. The Chinese characters used have, indeed, the signification of the lower ice of the autumn mountains; but “lower ice ”may well be simply phonetic in this case.

[^1983]: 326:4 _Haru-yamu no kasumi-wotoko_.

[^1984]: 326:5 In Japanese _kohedomo_, written with the characters ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32800.jpg). Perhaps Motowori is right in supposing this Verb to have been originally identical with _kofuru_, “to love” ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32801.jpg)) whose corresponding form is _kofuredomo_. If so, the author may have meant to make his hero say, “though I love the maiden, etc.” But it is better to be guided by the characters, and to suppose that he referred to the request made to her mother to grant her to him.

[^1985]: 326:6 Literally, “compute the height of my person and distil liquor in a jar.”

[^1986]: 326:7 _I.e._, all the valuable produce of the chase and of the fisheries, such as are perpetually mentioned in the Shinto “Rituals” as being presented to the gods, Thus in the “Service of the Goddess of Food” (see Mr. Satow's translation in Vol. VII, Pt. IV, p. 414 of these “Transactions,”) we read that the worshipper offered: “as to things which dwell in the mountains—things soft of hair and things rough of hair; as to things which grow in the great-field-plain sweet herbs and bitter herbs; as to things which dwell in the blue-sea-plain—things wide of fin and things narrow of fin, down to weeds of the offing and weeds of the shore.”

[^1987]: 327:8 Literally, “one child.”

[^1988]: 327:9 The Japanese original of the words here unavoidably rendered by “mortal men” in order to mark the antithesis to the word “Deities, has been more literally translated by ”living people“ in an earlier passage of the work (see Sect. IX, Note 17). The signification of the entire sentence is: ”During my lifetime, thy brother should be careful to imitate the upright conduct of the gods. For if, instead of doing so, he be dishonest and untruthful as are the sons of men, it will be at his own peril.”

[^1989]: 327:10 Or, according to the more usual reading, “a one-jointed bamboo;” but in either case the meaning is obscure. Motowori, who adopts the reading that has been followed in the translation, suggests that the expression may simply be a periphrasis for the bamboo in general.

[^1990]: 327:11 ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32802.jpg). Motowori remarks that the word “eight” in this p. 329 place (where, to indicate a considerable number we should rather expect “eighty”) is curious, and he surmises that ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32900.jpg) may be an error for ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32901.jpg), “large.” The word “coarse” itself is sufficient to show that the apertures left in the plaiting of the basket were large.

[^1991]: 327:12 _Scil_. of which the basket was woven.

[^1992]: 327:13 _Scil_. by her younger son.

[^1993]: 327:14 In this case, as Motowori remarks, it is the sea-water that is intended to be spoken of, whereas the allusion in the previous sentence is to hard salt. But the Japanese language uses the same word for both, and the same Chinese character is here also used in both contexts. For this curse _conf_. Sect. XL (Note 18 _et. seq._) and Sect. XLI.

[^1994]: 327:15 _Scil_. of the furnace (kitchen) in the younger brother's house, as Motowori suggests.

[^1995]: 327:16 The text has the character ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32902.jpg), which signifies “to wither” or “dry up” (spoken of trees). But the translator agrees with Motowori in considering it to be in all probability an error for ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32903.jpg), “to be prostrate; and in any case it could not here be rendered by either of the verbs ”dry up“ or ”wither "without introducing into the English version a tautology which does not exist in the Japanese original.

[^1996]: 327:17 Such seems to be the meaning of the obscure original _sono tokohi-do wo kahesashimeki_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32904.jpg)), Motowori would understand it in a rather more specialized sense to signify that “she caused the implement of the curse (_i.e._, the basket) to be taken away,”

[^1997]: 327:18 Literally, “was pacified.”

[^1998]: 327:19 Or, if we take ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32905.jpg) in the text as equivalent to ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/32906.jpg), “this is the origin of ”divine water-payments.”

[^1999]: 329:1 p. 330 _I.e._, the Emperor Ō-jin's.

[^2000]: 329:2 The import of this compound is not clear.

[^2001]: 329:3 _I.e._, “the  younger princess, the truly young princess.”

[^2002]: 329:4 _i.e._, “the great lord.”

[^2003]: 329:5 _Oho-hodo no miko_. The signification of _Oho-hodo_ is obscure. Motowori surmises it to have been originally the name of a place.

[^2004]: 329:6 _I.e._, “the great middle princess of Osaka. Osaka is the name of a place in Yamato. The word ”middle "should by the analogy of other such genealogies indicate the fact that this princess was the fourth child out of seven. Here however she is mentioned second, and the same designation is applied to the two next daughters. There is evidently some confusion in the tradition.

[^2005]: 330:7 _I.e._, “the middle princess of Tawi,”—a place in Kahachi.

[^2006]: 330:8 _I.e._, the middle princess of Tamiya.

[^2007]: 330:9 _I.e._, “the lady Koto-fushi of Fuji-hara.” But the meaning of Kato fushi is obscure, and Motowori surmises it to be an alternative or corrupt form of _Sotohoshi_. (For the celebrated princess of the latter name see Sect. CXXXVII, Note 9.) Fujihara is the name of a place in Yamato, and signifies “wistaria-moor.”

[^2008]: 330:10 _Torime no miko_. This name is obscure.

[^2009]: 330:11 _Sane no miko_. Motowori believes _sane_ to stand erroneously for _sami_; but both forms are obscure.

[^2010]: 330:12 The Japanese word includes both genders.

[^2011]: 330:13 p. 331 _Mikuni no kimi_. _Mikuni_ is the name of a well-known place in the province of Echizen. It signifies “three countries.”

[^2012]: 330:14 _Hata no kimi_. There are several places called Hata, and it is not known which of them is here intended. The signification of the name is also uncertain.

[^2013]: 330:15 _Okinaga no kimi_. See Sect. LXII, Note 31.

[^2014]: 330:16 _Sakata no Saka-bito no kimi_. This is Motowori's restoration of an apparently corrupt text. Sakata and Sakabito are both taken to be names of places, the first of a district in Afumi, the second of a place in Settsu. Sakabito ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/33100.jpg)) seems a very curious compound for the name of a place. Moreover the double title is unusual, and it may be thought that the word “Dukes” has fallen out of the text, and that in reality two families were intended to be spoken of.

[^2015]: 330:17 _Yamaji no kimi_. _Yamaji_ (“mountain road”) is supposed by Motowori to be the name of a place,—perhaps in the province of Higo.

[^2016]: 330:18 _Tsukushi no Meta no kimi_. Tsukushi is the old name of the whole of the South-Western island of the Japanese archipelago and Meta the name of a place in the province of Hizen in that island. The etymology of Meta is uncertain.

[^2017]: 330:19 _Fuse no kimi_. Fuse is the name of uncertain import found in several provinces. It is not known which is meant to be here designated.

[^2018]: 330:20 _Naka-tsu-hiko no miko_, _i.e._, “the middle prince,” a designation which would lead one to expect to find mention of an elder brother.

[^2019]: 330:21 _Iwashima no miko_. Iwashima seems to be the name of a place, but the signification of _Iha_ (not to be confounded with _iha_ “stone” or “rock”) is altogether obscure.

[^2020]: 330:22 _Katashiha no miko_. This prince has not been mentioned in the previous genealogies, which is curious. Katashiha is the name of a place in Chikuzen, and signifies “hard rock.”

[^2021]: 330:23 _Kunu no miko_. _Kunu_ is altogether obscure.

[^2022]: 332:1 p. 332 Or, as Motowori reads it, _Mofushi_. The etymology is uncertain. _Wega_ has already appeared in Sect. CIII (Note 3). The Old Printed Edition and some Manuscripts have at the conclusion of this volume the following note: ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/33200.jpg), “It is the mausoleum of Mozu.” But Mozu is in the province of Idzumi, and all the later editions discard this note as an interpolation.
