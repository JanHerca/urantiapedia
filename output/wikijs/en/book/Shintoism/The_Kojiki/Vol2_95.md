## SECT. XCI.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART XVI.—YAMATO-TAKE'S BUTLER).

During all the time that this \[Prince\] His Augustness Yamato-take went about pacifying countries, Nana-tsuka-hagi, [^1664] ancestor of the Suzerains of Kuna, [^1665] always followed and respectfully served him as butler.


## SECT. XCII.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART XVII.—YAMATO-TAKE'S DESCENDANTS).

This \[Prince\] His Augustness Yamato-take wedded Her Augustness Princess Futaji-no-iri, [^1666] daughter of the Heavenly Sovereign Ikume, and begot an august child: His Augustness Tarashi-naka-tsu-hiko [^1667] (one Deity). Again, wedding Her Augustness Princess Oto-tachibana [^1668] who \[afterwards\] entered the sea, [^1669] he begot an august child: King Waka-take [^1670] (one Deity). Again, wedding Princess \[224\] Futaji, [^1671] daughter of Oho-tamu-wake, [^1672] ancestor of the Rulers of the Land of Yasu in Chika-tsu-Afumi, [^1673] he begot an august child: King Ine-yori-wake [^1674] (one Deity). Again, wedding Princess Oho-kibi-take, [^1675] younger sister of Take-hiko \[ancestor of the\] Grandees of Kiki, [^1676] he begot an <span id="p278">[<sup><small>p. 278</small></sup>]</span> august child: King Take-kahiko [^1677] (one Deity). Again, wedding Princess Kukuma-mori of Yamashiro, [^1678] he begot an august child, King Ashi-kagami-wake [^1679] (one Deity). A child by another wife was King Okinaga-ta-wake. [^1680] Al-together the entire \[number\] of the august children of His Augustness Yamato-take was six Deities. So His Augustness Tarashi-naka-tsu-hiko \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the Empire. The next, King Ine-yori-wake (was the ancestor of the Dukes of Inukami [^1681] and of the Dukes of Takebe.) [^1682] \[225\] The next, King Take-kahiko (was the ancestor of the Dukes of Aya in Sanugi, [^1683] the Dukes of Wake in Iyo, [^1684] the Lords of Towo, [^1685] the Headmen of Masa [^1686] and the Lords of Miyaji.) [^1687] King Ashi-kagami-wake (was the ancestor of the Lords of Kamakura, [^1688] the Dukes of Wodzu, [^1689] the Lords of Ihashiro [^1690] and the Lords of Fukita.) [^1691] The child of the next, King Okinaga-ta-wake was King Kuhi-mata-naga-hiko. [^1692] This King's children were: Her Augustness Princess Ihinu-ma-guro, [^1693] next Okinaga-ma-waka-naka-tsu-hime, [^1694] next Oto-hime [^1695] (three Deities). So the above mentioned King Waka-take wedded Princess Ihinu-ma-guro, \[226\] and begot King Sume-iro-oho-naka-tsu-hiko. [^1696] This King wedded Princess Shibanu, [^1697] daughter of Shibanu-iri-ki [^1698] of Afumi, and begot a child, Her Augustness Princess Kaguro. [^1699] So the Heavenly Sovereign Oho-tarashi-hiko wedded this \[lady\] Her Augustness Princess Kaguro, and begot King Oho-ye [^1700] (one Deity). This King wedded his younger half-sister Queen Shiro-kane, [^1701] and begot children: King Oho-na-gata, [^1702] and next Her Augustness Oho-naka-tsu-hime [^1703] (two Deities). So this \[Lady\] Her Augustness Oho-naka-tsu-hime was the august mother [^1704] of King Kagosaka [^1705] and King Oshikuma. [^1706]

<span id="p281">[<sup><small>p. 281</small></sup>]</span>

## SECT. XCIII.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART XVIII. HIS AGE AND PLACE OF BURIAL).

This Heavenly Sovereign's august years were one hundred and thirty-seven, and his august mausoleum is above the Yamanobe road. [^1707]


## SECT. XCIV.—EMPEROR SEI-MU.

The Heavenly Sovereign Wata-tarashi-hiko dwelt at the palace of Taka-anaho at Shiga [^1708] in Chika-tsu-Afumi and ruled the empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded \[227\] the Lady Oho-takara, [^1709] daughter of Take-oshiyama-tari-ne, [^1710] ancestor of the Grandees of Hodzumi, [^1711] and begot an august child: King Wata-nuke [^1712] (one Deity). So \[the <span id="p282">[<sup><small>p. 282</small></sup>]</span> Heavenly Sovereign\] raised the Noble Take-uchi [^1713] \[to the office of\] Prince Minister, [^1714] deigned to settle the Rulers of the Great Countries and Small Countries, [^1715] and likewise deigned to settle the boundaries of the various countries, as also the Department Lords of the Great Departments and Small Departments. [^1716] The Heavenly Sovereign's august years were ninety-five, and his august mausoleum is at Tatanami near Saki. [^1717]


<span id="p283">[<sup><small>p. 283</small></sup>]</span>

## SECT. XCV.—EMPEROR CHIŪ-AI (PART I.—GENEALOGIES).

The Heavenly Sovereign Tarashi-naka-tsu-hiko dwelt at the palace of Toyora at Anado, [^1718] and likewise at the palace of Kashihi [^1719] in Tsukushi, and ruled the Empire. \[328\] This Heavenly Sovereign wedded Her Augustness Oho-naka-tsu-hime, [^1720] daughter of King Oho-ye, and begot august children: King Kagosaka and King Oshikuma (two Deities). Again he wedded Her Augustness Princess Okinaga-tarashi. This Empress [^1721] gave birth to august children: His Augustness Homu-ya-wake, [^1722] and next His Augustness Oho-tomo-wake, [^1723] another name for whom was His Augustness Homuda-wake. [^1724] The reason why this Heir Apparent [^1725] was given the august name of His Augustness Oho-tomo-wake was that when first [^1726] born, he had on his august arm \[a protuberance of\] flesh resembling an elbow-pad, [^1727] whence the august name bestowed on him. By this it was known while he was in the womb that he would rule countries. [^1728] In this august reign the granaries of Ahaji were established.

## Footnotes


[^1669]: 277:1a The name signifies “seven-grasp shins,” implying that the worthy here mentioned was so big and strong as to have shins seven hand-breadths in length. For the use of the word “grasp ”as a measure of length, see Sect. VIII, Note 1.

[^1670]: 277:2a This family has already been mentioned at the end of Sect. XXXIV, as descended from Ama-tsu-kume no Mikoto, one of the companions of the Emperor Jim-mu's grandfather on the occasion of his descent from Heaven. But see Note 7 to that Sect. for the probable mistake with regard to the origin of the name.

[^1671]: 277:1b p. 278 For this name see Sect. LXIX, Note 24.

[^1672]: 277:2b _I.e._, “the perfect middle prince,” a name which is justified by p. 279 the genealogy as given in the “Chronicles,” where he is mentioned as the second of three sons borne by this princess.

[^1673]: 277:3 _Oto-tachibana-hime no mikoto_. _Oto_ signifies “younger \[sister\],” and _Oto-tachibana_ is the name of the orange.

[^1674]: 277:4 See the story in Sect. LXXXIV.

[^1675]: 277:5 _Waka-tate no miko_. This name signifies “young brave.”

[^1676]: 277:6 _Futaji-hime_. Signification obscure. Futaji may be the name of a place.

[^1677]: 277:7 If _Tamu_ is, as Motowori surmises, the name of a place, this personal name signifies “Great Lord of Tamu.”

[^1678]: 277:8 _Chika-tsu-Afumi no Yasu no kuni no miyatsuko_. For _Yasu_ see Sect. LXII, Note 62.

[^1679]: 277:9 _Ine-yori-wake no miko_. This name probably signifies “rice-good-lord.”

[^1680]: 277:10 _Oho-kibi-take-hime_. _Oho_ signifies “great.” For the other two elements of the compound see next Note.

[^1681]: 277:11 The text has _Kibi no omi Take-hiko_, as if this worthy had been himself the “Grandee of Kibi.” Motowori however compares the commencement of Sect. LXXXII (Notes 2 and 3), and supplies the words “ancestor of.” _Kibi_ is of course the province of that name (the modern, Bizen, Bitchiū, and Bingo), and _take_ signifies “brave.”

[^1682]: 278:12 _Take-kahiko no miko_. _Take_ signifies “brave,” _kahiko_ is either “egg ”or “cocoon,” or else perhaps a corruption of some other word.

[^1683]: 278:13 _Yamashiro no Kukuma mori-hime_. This name is obscure. Motowori identifies Kukuma with a place called _Kurihuma_, and _mori_ is probably the Verb “to guard.”

[^1684]: 278:14 _Ashi-kagami-wake no miko_. This name is written with characters signifying “foot-mirror-\[lord\].”

[^1685]: 278:15 _Okinaga-ta-wake no miko_. This name is obscure. Motowori believes Okinaga to be the name of a place in Afumi, but has no explanation to offer of _ta_.

[^1686]: 278:16 _Inukami no kimi_. Inukami is the name of a district in Afumi, Its signification is not clear.

[^1687]: 278:17 _Takebi no kimi_. _Takebe_ became the name of a place in Idzumo, but it originally signified “brave tribe,” the family having, as in so many other cases, given its name to the place of its residence, instead of being called after the latter. See the origin of the name, given in Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXIV, pp. 35-36.

[^1688]: 278:18 _Sanugi no Aya no kimi_. For _Sanugi_ see Sect. V, Note 6. _Aya_ is a district in the province; the name is of doubtful origin.

[^1689]: 278:19 p. 280 _Iyo no wake no kani_. For _Iyo_ see Sect. V, Note 4. (The text here has _Ise_ for Iyo, and the word _wake_ is missing, but Motowori's emendation may be accepted). _Wake_ is the name of a district in Iyo.

[^1690]: 278:20 _Towo no wake_. Of _Towo_ nothing is known.

[^1691]: 278:21 _Masa no obito_. Of _Masa_ nothing is known.

[^1692]: 278:22 _Miyagi_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28000.jpg)) _no wake_. This is Motowori's ingenious emendation of the characters in the text, ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28001.jpg), out of which it is impossible to make a family name. _Miyagi_ is the name of a place in the province of Mikaha, and signifies “temple road.”

[^1693]: 278:23 _Kamakura no wake_. Kamakura is the name of a district in the province of Sagami, which became famous during the Middle Ages as the site of an immense town,—the capital of the Shōgun, and the centre of the feudalism which then ruled Japan. The import of the name (literally “sickle-store”) is not clear, though it has been fancifully explained by native etymologists.

[^1694]: 278:24 _Wodzu no kimi_. The words _no kimi_ are supplied by Motowori, this name and the next being in the text run into one. Wodzu seems to be the name of a place in Afumi, and signifies “little mart.”

[^1695]: 278:25 _Ihashiro no wake_. Motowori says that this Ihashiro is not the province of that name, but a place in Kishiu. The meaning of the name is obscure.

[^1696]: 278:26 _Fukita no wake_. This is but Motowori's conjectural restoration (founded on a statement in the “Chronicles of Old Matters of Former Ages”) of the name as given in the text, ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28002.jpg).

[^1697]: 278:27 _Kuhimata-naga-hiko no miko_. _Kuhimata_ (modern _Kumata_) is the name of a place in Settsu. The signification is obscure. _Naga-hiko_ means “long prince.”

[^1698]: 278:28 _Ihinu-ma-guro-hime_, _i.e._, “quite black princess of Ihinu,” the blackness being doubtless predicated of her hair. _Ihinu_ is the name of a district in Ise, and is written with characters signifying “boiled-rice-moor.”

[^1699]: 278:29 For _Okinaga_ see Note 15. _Ma-waka_ means “truly young.” _Naka-tsu-hime_ means “middle princess,” referring to her being the second of three.

[^1700]: 278:30 _I.e._, “younger princess.”

[^1701]: 278:31 See Sect. LXXVI, Note 29.

[^1702]: 278:32 _Shibanu-hime_. This name is obscure.

[^1703]: 278:33 _Shibunu iri-ko_. This name is obscure.

[^1704]: 278:34 _Ka-gara hime_, see Sect. LXXVI, Note 28.

[^1705]: 278:35 p. 281 For the confusion in this portion of the genealogy see Sect. LXXVI, Note 30.

[^1706]: 278:36 _Shiro-kane no miko_. _Shiro-kane_ means “silver,” but Motowori suspects corruption in the text.

[^1707]: 278:37 _Oho-nagata no miko_, _i.e._, “great prince of Nagata,” the latter being the name of a place in Settsu, signifying “long rice-field.”

[^1708]: 278:38 _I.e._, “great middle princess.”

[^1709]: 278:39 Literally, “ancestress.”

[^1710]: 278:40 Or, “the King of Kagosaka,” for it is' uncertain whether Kagosaka should or should not be regarded as the name of a place. The etymology of the name may be _kago_, “a stag” and _saka_, “an ascent.” The original form of the name and title is _Kagosaka no miko_.

[^1711]: 278:41 Or, “the King of Oshikuma,” _Oshikuma no miko_. _Oshikuma_ is a word of doubtful etymology.

[^1712]: 281:1a See Sect. LXVIII, Note 1.

[^1713]: 281:1b _Shiga no Taka-anaho_. _Shiga_ is the name of a well known district, and is of uncertain, signification, as is also _Taka-anaho_. For _Chika-tsu-Afumi_ see Sect. XXIX, Note 20.

[^1714]: 281:2 _Oto-takara no iratsume_. _Oto_ signifies “younger \[sister\],” and _takara_ is “treasure.”

[^1715]: 281:3 _Oshiyama_ is the name of a place in Ise, _take_ signifies “brave” and _tari_ and _ne_ are Honorifics of frequent occurrence.

[^1716]: 281:4 _Hodzumi no omi_. See Sect. LXI, Note 4.

[^1717]: 281:5 _Waka-nuke no miko_. This name is of doubtful signification, and Motowori suspects that it is corrupt, and that the true reading would be _Waka-take_, “young-brave.”

[^1718]: 282:6 See Sect. LXI, Note 25.

[^1719]: 282:7 ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28200.jpg). Motowori tries to prove that in the earliest times this official title was simply an Honorific surname formed by prefixing the Adjective ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28201.jpg) “great” to ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28202.jpg), a surname read “Omi” (the character signifies properly “attendant,” “subject.”) Probably like other “gentile names” it combined both characters, and had a tendency to become hereditary.

[^1720]: 282:8 _Oho-kuni wo-kuni no kuni no miyatsuko_.

[^1721]: 282:9 _Oho-agata wo-agata no agata nushi_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28203.jpg)). Their duties are supposed to have consisted in supervising the government farms.

[^1722]: 282:10 For _Saki_ see Sect. LXXV, Note 5. _Tatanami_ may perhaps signify “putting shields in a row.”

[^1723]: 283:1 p. 283 For _Anado_ see Sect. LXXX (Note 22). _Toyora_ (for _Toyo-ura_) signifies “fertile shore.”

[^1724]: 283:2 This name seems to be derived from that of the evergreen oak. It will be noticed that both these capitals are in the South-Western Island of Kiushiu, whereas, from Jim-mu downwards, the capitals of all the Emperors previously mentioned are either in Yamato or in one of the adjacent central provinces.

[^1725]: 283:3 For this and the three following names see Sect. XCII, and for _Okinaga tarashi_ Sect. LXII, Note 72.

[^1726]: 283:4 Written ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28300.jpg). It is she who is celebrated in Japanese history under the name of Jin-gō Kōgō, and in the “Chronicles” her reign is counted separately. In these “Records,” however, the period of her rule is forming part of the reign of her son O-jin.

[^1727]: 283:5 The signification of this name is obscure.

[^1728]: 283:6 p. 284 _I.e._, “great elbow-pad lord,” _tomo_ signifying “elbow pad.” The next sentence of the text gives the traditional origin of this curious name.

[^1729]: 283:7 _I.e._, lord of Homuda. _Homuda_ is supposed by Motowori and Moribe to be the name of a place, they (apparently with reason) rejecting as a late addition a note to the “Chronicles,” which states that _homuda_ was synonymous with _tomo_ “elbow-pad.”

[^1730]: 283:8 For “heir apparent ”see Sect. XXXIII, Note 2.

[^1731]: 283:9 This word, says Motowori, is redundant.

[^1732]: 283:10 For the use of elbow-pads in war see Sect XIII, Note 7.

[^1733]: 283:11 The word rendered “rule” (_shiru_, ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28400.jpg)) is supplied by the editor of 1687. Motowori supplies the evident lacuna in the text by the word “establish” (_sadamaru_ ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28401.jpg)); but this seems less good. Motowori's reasons for taking the word _kuni_ (“country”) in the Plural are, however, convincing,—the three countries into which Korea was anciently divided, and which are appropriately designated by the title of _San Kan_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28402.jpg)), being evidently designated by the expression in the text, as may be seen both by reference to the parallel passage in the “Chronicles,” and also by considering that in this manner that warlike implement the elbow-pad, with the semblance of which the young Emperor was born, obtains its proper significance. This Emperor (for it is he who is known as Ō-jin Ten-nō) is sometimes designated by the name of the “Emperor in the Womb” ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/28403.jpg)).
