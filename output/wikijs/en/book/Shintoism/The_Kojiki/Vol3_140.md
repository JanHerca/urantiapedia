## SECT. CXXXVI.—EMPEROR HAN-ZEI.

His Augustness Midzu-ha-wake dwelt in the palace of Shibakaki at Tajihi, [^2176] and ruled the Empire. The length of this Heavenly sovereign's august person was nine feet two inches and a half. [^2177] The length of his august teeth was one inch, and their breadth two lines, and the upper and lower \[row\] corresponded exactly, \[like jewels strung together\]. The Heavenly Sovereign wedded the Lady of Tsunu, [^2178] daughter of Kogoto, Grandee of Wani, [^2179] and begot august children: the Lady of Kahi; [^2180] next the Lady of Tsubura [^2181] (two Deities). Again he wedded Oto-hime, [^2182] daughter of the same Grandee, and begot august children: King Takara; [^2183] next the Lady of Takabe. [^2184]—-altogether four Kings \[and Queens\]. [^2185] The Heavenly Sovereign's august years were sixty. His august mausoleum is on the Moor of Mozu. [^2186]

[^2187] 

(PART I—GENEALOGIES).

His Augustness Wo-asa-dzu-ma-waku-go-no-sukune dwelt in the Palace of Toho-tsu-Asuka, [^2188] and ruled the Empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded Her Augustness Osaka-no-oho-naka-tsu-hime, [^2189] younger sister of King Oho-hodo, and begot august children: King Karu of Kinashi; [^2190] next Nagata-no-oho-iratsume; [^2191] next King Kurohiko of Sakahi; [^2192] next His Augustness Anaho; [^2193] next Karu-no-oho-iratsume [^2194] another name for whom is Sotohoshi-no-iratsume. [^2195] (the reason for her being given the august name of Queen So-tohoshi was that the refulgence of her person passed through her garments); next King Shiro-biko of Yatsuri; [^2196] next His Augustness \[294\] Oho-hatsuse: [^2197] (nine Deities). Altogether the Heavenly Sovereign's august children \[numbered\] nine Deities—(five Kings and four Queens). Of these nine Kings and <span id="p366"><sup><small>[ p. 366 ]</small></sup></span> Queens, His Augustness Anaho [^2198] \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the Empire. Next his Augustness Oho-hatsuse [^2199] ruled the Empire.


<span id="p367"><sup><small>[ p. 367 ]</small></sup></span>

## SECT. CXXXVIII.—EMPEROR IN-GIYŌ (PART II.—HIS SICKNESS IS CURED BY A KOREAN PHYSICIAN).

The Heavenly Sovereign, when first about to rule the succession of Heaven's Sun, [^2200] declined, saying: “I have a long sickness; I cannot rule the sun's succession.” Nevertheless, as from the Empress downwards all the magnates strongly urged him, he forthwith ruled the Empire. At this time the ruler of Shiragi [^2201] dutifully sent eighty-one vessels with august tribute. Then the chief envoy [^2202] sent with the august tribute, whose name was Komu-ha-chimu-kamu-ki-mu, [^2203] was a man deeply versed in the medical art. So he cured the Heavenly Sovereign's august sickness.


## SECT. CXXXIX.—EMPEROR IN-GIYŌ (PART III. HE RECTIFIES THE PEOPLE'S NAMES).

Thereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, lamenting the transgressions in the surnames and gentile names of the people of all the surnames and names in the Empire [^2204] placed jars \[for trial by\] hot water [^2205] at the Wondrous <span id="p368"><sup><small>[ p. 368 ]</small></sup></span> Cape of Eighty Evils in Words at Amakashi, [^2206] and deigned to establish the surnames and gentile names of the eighty heads of companies. [^2207] Again the Karu Tribe [^2208] was established as the august proxy of King Karu of Ki-nashi; the Osaka Tribe [^2209] was established as the Empress's august proxy; and the Kaha Tribe [^2210] was established as the august proxy of the Empress's younger sister Ta-wi no Naka-tsu-hime. [^2211]


<span id="p369"><sup><small>[ p. 369 ]</small></sup></span>

## SECT. CXL.—EMPEROR IN-GIYŌ (PART IV.—HIS AGE AND PLACE OF BURIAL).

The Heavenly Sovereign's august years were seventy-eight. His august mausoleum is at Naga-ye near Wega in Kafuchi. [^2212]

## Footnotes


[^2181]: 364:1 p. 364 For Tajihi see Sect. CXXXII, Note 4. _Shiba-kaki_ (or _Shiba-gaki_) signifies “a fence of brushwood.”

[^2182]: 364:2 As to the ancient Japanese measures we have no accurate information, and the English equivalents used in this passage correspond but approximately to the modern Japanese standards. The character rendered “line” is ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36400.jpg), which denotes the tenth part of a ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36401.jpg) or “inch.” Motowori remarks that the dimensions of the teeth are not anything extraordinary p. 365 judged by the present standard, and suppose that anciently the measures of length must have been smaller than at present.

[^2183]: 364:3 _Tsunu no iratsume_. The signification of this name is obscure.

[^2184]: 364:4 _Wani no kogoto no omi_. The meaning of Kogoto is obscure, Wani has already often appeared.

[^2185]: 364:5 _Kahi no iratsume_. Kahi is the name of a province, but it cannot be said for certain that it is from it that this Princess derived her name.

[^2186]: 364:6 _Tsubura no iratsume_. The meaning of _Tsubura_ is obscure.

[^2187]: 364:7 _I.e._, “the younger princess.”

[^2188]: 364:8 _Takara no miko_. _Takara_ signifies “treasure.”

[^2189]: 364:9 _Takabe no iratsume_. _Takabe_ seems to be the name of a place unless it be considered to be connected with the word _taka_, “hawk.”

[^2190]: 364:10 Remember that the single character ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36500.jpg) includes both sexes.

[^2191]: 364:11 See Sect. CXXX. Note 1.

[^2192]: 365:1 p. 366 Also pronounced _In-kiyo_.

[^2193]: 365:2 See Sect. CXXXIII, Note 13.

[^2194]: 365:3 This name and the next have already appeared in Sect. CXVII.

[^2195]: 365:4 _Kinashi no Karu no miko_. Karu is properly the name of a place in Yamato which has already often appeared in the text. It is uncertain whether _kinashi_ is likewise the name of a place or of a particular kind of pear; but Motowori inclines to the former view.

[^2196]: 365:5 _I.e._, “the great lord of Negate.” There are many places of this name (lit. “long rice-field”), and it is not known which is here intended.

[^2197]: 365:6 _I.e._, “the black prince of Sakahi.” The latter word signifies “frontier.” It is not known where Sakahi is, neither is the reason for the name of “black prince” applied to this personage known (_Conf_. the “white prince” mentioned a little further on).

[^2198]: 365:7 Or, “of Anaho,” for Anaho is properly the name of a place in Yamato. Its import is not clear.

[^2199]: 365:8 _I.e._, “the great lady of Karu.”

[^2200]: 365:9 Written ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36600.jpg), _i.e._, “the garment-passing lady.” _So-tohoshi_ is Motowori's reading of the characters, the usual reading being _So-tohori_ (the Intransitive instead of the Transitive form of the Verb). He likewise identifies Koto-fushi (see Sect. CXVII, Note 9) with this celebrated princess, who is commonly worshipped as Goddess of Poetry. There is much confusion in the traditions concerning her, and Motowori's notes on the subject in Vol. XXXIV, pp. 53-54 and in Vol. XXXIX of his Commentary, p. 3, should be consulted.

[^2201]: 365:10 _Yatsuri no shiro-bike no miko_, _i.e._, “the white prince of Yatsuri.” Yatsuri is the name of a place in Yamato. It is written with characters signifying “eight melons.”

[^2202]: 365:11 _I.e._, “great Hatsuse,” so called from Hatsuse, a celebrated place in Yamato, which has already been mentioned.

[^2203]: 366:12 _I.e._ “the great lady of Tachibana,” the latter being the name of a place in Yamato. The word signifies “orange.”

[^2204]: 366:13 _I.e._, “the lady of Sakami,” the latter being apparently the name of a place either in Harima or in Wohari. Its derivation is not clear.

[^2205]: 367:1a p. 367 For this expression see Sect. XXXIII, Note 27. The story of the refusal of this monarch to accept the crown which was offered to him by the magnates of the nation is told at considerable length in the parallel passage of the “Chronicles.” According to the same authority he belonged to a collateral branch of the Imperial family, and was therefore not in the regular line of succession.

[^2206]: 367:2a See Sect. XCVIII. Note 2.

[^2207]: 367:3 Literally, “great messenger.”

[^2208]: 367:4 ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36700.jpg) Motowori decides that ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36701.jpg) is the surname, ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36702.jpg) an official title, ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36703.jpg) an official designation of the kinsmen of the Korean King, and ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36704.jpg) the personal name.

[^2209]: 367:1b p. 368 The original is; ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36800.jpg), which Motowori reads _ame no shita no uji-uji na-na no hito domo no uji kabane_.

[^2210]: 367:2b We learn from the “Chronicles” that he whose hand was injured in the process of dipping it into the jar of boiling water was pronounced a deceiver, while those who stood the trial unhurt were considered to be telling the truth.

[^2211]: 368:3 _Amakashi no koio-yo-maga-tsu-hi no saki_. Motowori truly observes that this does not sound like an actual geographical name, but was rather, it may be supposed, a new designation given to Cape Amakashi (see Sect. LXXII, Note 10) on account of the incident here mentioned. The name reminds us of that of one of the deities born from the purification of the person of the creator Izanagi after his return from Hades (see X, Note 14).

[^2212]: 368:4 _Ya-sotomo-no-wo_. See Sect. XXXIII, Note 19.

[^2213]: 368:5 _Karu-be_.

[^2214]: 368:6 _Osaka-be_, so called after the Empress's native place (See Sect. CXXXVII, Note 3, and Sect. CXVII, Note 6). The reading of _Osaka-be_ is given in all the editions to the characters in the text, ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36801.jpg), where we should expect ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/36802.jpg). Motowori's explanation of the reason why the name was thus written will be found in Vol. XXXIX, p. 19, of his Commentary.

[^2215]: 368:7 _Kaha-be_. Motowori supposes that there is here some corruption of the text, as no connection can be discovered between the name of this Tribe and that of the Princess whose proxy the tribe became.

[^2216]: 368:8 See Sect. CXVII, Note 7.

[^2217]: 369:1a See Sect. CIII, Note 2 and 3.
