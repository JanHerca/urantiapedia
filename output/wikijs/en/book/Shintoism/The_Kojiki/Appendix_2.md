APPENDIX II.

THE HITHERTO ACCEPTED CHRONOLOGY OF THE EARLY JAPANESE SOVEREIGNS MENTIONED IN THE “RECORDS OF ANCIENT MATTERS” (“_KO-JI-KI_”) AND IN THE “CHRONICLES OF JAPAN” (“_NI-HONGI_” ).

\[This “Accepted Chronology ”is contained in the first three columns of figures, whereof the first two, giving the corresponding dates according to the European reckoning are transcribed from some Comparative Chronological Tables by Mr. Ernest Satow, printed for private distribution in 1874. The ages of the monarchs in the third column are from “The Digest of the Imperial Pedigree,” a work published by the Imperial Japanese Government is 1877, and therefore carrying with it the weight of authority. It might perhaps be too much to say that even its decisions are universally bowed to by the native _literati_, but the differences between various writers are all slight, and excepting on points that affect only a very few years, the chronology contained in the first three columns may justly be styled the “Accepted Chronology” both as far as natives and as far as foreigners are concerned. It will be seen that it is founded in the main on the statements contained in the “Chronicles of Japan,” though sometimes differing therefrom as well as from the “Records.” The fourth column contains the ages of the monarchs according to the “Records” and the fifth their ages according to the “Chronicles.” The portion printed in italics, and including a little over a thousand years, is that which has been shown in Section V of the Translator's Introduction to be undeserving of credence.
