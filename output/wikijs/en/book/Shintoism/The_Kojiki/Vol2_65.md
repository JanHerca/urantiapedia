## SECT. LXIV.—EMPEROR SŪ-JIN (PART II.—A PESTILENCE IS STAID BY OHO-TATA-NE-KO).

In the reign of this Heavenly Sovereign a great pestilence arose, and the people died as if none were to be left. [^1311] Then the Heavenly Sovereign grieved and lamented, and at night, while on his divine couch, [^1312] there appeared \[to him\] in an august dream the Great Deity the Great-Master-of-Things, [^1313] and said: “This is my august doing. [^1314] So if thou wilt cause me to be worshipped [^1315] by Oho-tata-ne-ko, [^1316] the divine spirit shall not arise, [^1317] and the land will be tranquillized.” When, therefore, couriers [^1318] were dispatched in every direction [^1319] to search for the person \[named\] Oho-tata-ne-ko, he was discovered in the village of Minu [^1320] in Kafuchi, and was respectfully sent \[to the Heavenly Sovereign\]. [^1321] Then the Heavenly Sovereign deigned to ask: “Whose child art thou?” He replied, saying: "I [^1322] am Oho-tats-ne-ko, child of <span id="p216"><sup><small>[ p. 216 ]</small></sup></span> His Augustness Take-mika-dzu-chi [^1323] \[who was\] child of His Augustness Ihi-gata-sumi, [^1324] \[who was\] child of His Augustness Kushi-mi-gata, [^1325] \[who was\] child of the Great Deity the Great-Master-of-Things by his wife Iku-tama-yori-bime, [^1326] daughter of His Augustness Suwe-tsu-mimi. [^1327] Hereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, being greatly rejoiced, commanded that the Empire should be tranquil, and the people flourish, and forthwith made His Augustness Oho-tata-ne-ko high priest [^1328] to worship [^1329] the Great Deity of Great Miwa [^1330] on Mount Mimoro. [^1331] Again he ordered His Augustness Igaka-shiko-wo [^1332] to make eighty heavenly platters, and reverently to establish the shrines of the Earthly Deities; [^1333] likewise to worship with a red-coloured shield and spear the Deity of Sumi-saka [^1334] at Uda, and with a black-coloured shield and spear the Deity of Oho-sake; [^1335] likewise to present august offerings of cloth to all the Deities of the august declivities of the hills and to all the Deities of the reaches of the rivers, without neglecting any. [^1336] [^1337] In consequence of this the pestilential vapour ceased altogether, and the country was tranquillized.

## SECT. LXV.—EMPEROR SŪ-JIN (PART III: STORY OF OHO-TATA-NE-KO'S BIRTH)

The reason why this person called Oho-tata-ne-ko was known to be a Deity's child, was that the above-mentioned Iku-tama-yori-bime was regularly beautiful, [^1338] whereupon a \[^1339]\] youth \[who thought\] the majesty of her appearance without comparison in the world, [^1340] came suddenly to her in the middle of the night, So, as they loved each other and lived in matrimony together, the maiden ere long was pregnant. Then the father and mother, astonished at their daughter being pregnant, asked her, [^1341] saying: “Thou art pregnant by thyself. How art thou with child without \[having known\] a man?” She replied, saying: I have naturally conceived through a beautiful young <span id="p219"><sup><small>[ p. 219 ]</small></sup></span> man, whose name [^1342] I know not, coming here every evening and staying with me.“ Therefore the father and mother, wishing to know the man, instructed their daughter, saying: ”Sprinkle red earth in front of the couch, [^1343] and pass a skein of hemp through a needle, and pierce \[therewith\] the skirt of his garment." So she did as they had instructed, and, on looking in the morning, the hemp that had been put in the needle went out through the hole of the door-hook, [^1344] and all the hemp that remained was three twists [^1345] only. Then forthwith, knowing how he had gone out by the hook-hole, they went on their quest following the thread, which, reaching Mount Miwa, stopped at the shrine of the Deity, So they knew \[that Oho-tata-neko was\] the child of the Deity \[residing\] there. So the place was called by the name of Miwa on account of the three twists of hemp that had remained. (His Augustness Oho-tata-ne-ko, here referred to, was the ancestor of the Dukes of Miwa [^1346] and of the Dukes of Kamo.) [^1347]

## Footnotes


[^1144]: 199:1 p. 201 In Yamato. For Karu see Sect. LVII, Note I. _Sakahi-bara_ signifies “boundary moor.”

[^1145]: 199:2 _I.e._, perhaps, “the beautiful but alarming female.”

[^1146]: 199:3 _I.e._, perhaps, “the beautiful but alarming male.”

[^1147]: 199:4 _Hodzumi no omi_. There are several places called Hodzumi in various provinces. The name appears to signify “piling up rice-ears.”

[^1148]: 199:5 _I.e._, “great prince.”

[^1149]: 199:6 _I.e._, “little prince-fierce-boar-heart,” the boar being known for its savage disposition.

[^1150]: 199:7 Excluding the last member of the compound, this name signifies “young-Yamato-lord-prince-great” _Bibi_ is identified by Motowori with the word _mimi_, which so often recurs in proper names (see Sect. XIII, Note 18).

[^1151]: 200:8 Motowori explains this name in the sense of “brilliant-alarming-female,” but some doubt must attach to it.

[^1152]: 200:9 _I.e._, perhaps, “prince vast-great-truth.”

[^1153]: 200:10 _Hani-yasu-bime_. This name has already been met with in Sect. VII, Note 3. Motowori however supposes that in this place Haniyasu should be considered to be the name of a place in Yamato.

[^1154]: 200:11 _I.e._, a man called “green jewel” who lived in the province of Kafuchi.

[^1155]: 200:12 _Take_ signifies “brave.” For the rest of the name see Note 10.

[^1156]: 200:13 _Take_ signifies “brave.” _Wake_ is either “young” or “lord.” For _Nuna-kaha_ see Sect. LI, Note 31.

[^1157]: 200:14 p. 202 _Abe no omi_. There are several places called Abe, and it is doubtful to which of them the text here refers.

[^1158]: 200:15 The signification of _inakoshi_ seems to be “rice-chariot”. _Hiko_ is “prince,” and _wake_ either “young ”or “lord.”

[^1159]: 200:16 _Kashihade no omi_, This name is traditionally referred to an incident in the reign of the Emperor Kei-ko, who is said to have bestowed it on one of his attendants who served up to him a particularly savoury dish of shell-fish. “Butlers” (perhaps the word might also be rendered “cooks”) have been mentioned towards the end of Sect. XXXII, and again in the legend of Jim-mu's slaughter of the “earth-spiders ”related in Sect. XLVIII.

[^1160]: 200:17 _Katsuraki-no-takachina-bime-no-mikoto_. The signification of _Takachina_ is obscure.

[^1161]: 200:18 By aphaeresis for _Oho-inabi_, the form of the name given in the “Chronicles of Old Matters of Former Ages.” itself perhaps standing by apocope for _Oho-ina-biko_, which would signify “great rice-prince.”

[^1162]: 200:19 _Wohari no Murazhi_.

[^1163]: 200:20 _Umashi Uchi no sukune_. Umashi signifies “sweet,” and _Uchi_ is the name of a place in Yamashiro.

[^1164]: 200:21 _Yamashiro no Uchi no omi_.

[^1165]: 200:22 This name may be rendered literally “the shade beneath the mountains,” but the signification is “the glow from the autumn leaves on the mountain-side.”

[^1166]: 200:23 _I.e._, probably “wonderful (or precious) prince.”

[^1167]: 200:24 _Ki no kuni no miyatsuko no aya_.

[^1168]: 200:25 _Take-Uchi no sukune_. _Take_ signifies “brave,” and _Uchi_ is the name of a district in Yamato. The common, but erroneous, reading of this name is _Take no Uchi no sukune_. The celebrated personage, who may be styled the Methuselah of Japan, is said to have lived during the reigns of five Emperors, who themselves averaged over a hundred years of life each. His own age is variously given as 255, 260, etc. up to 360 years.

[^1169]: 200:26 _Hata no Yashiro no sukune_. _Hata_ and _Yashiro_ are supposed by Motowori to be the names of places in Yamato. _Yashiro_ signifies “shrine.” _Hata_ is of uncertain derivation.

[^1266]: 206:61 _Mikaha no Ho no wake_. Ho is the name of a district, and is of obscure derivation. Mikaha is the name of a maritime province. It p. 211 signifies “three rivers,” with reference to two large rivers which flow through it and to another which forms the boundary between it and the province of Wohari.

[^1267]: 207:62 _Chika-tsu-Afumi no Yasu no atahe_. Yasu is the name of a district, and is of uncertain origin.

[^1285]: 207:80 _Chi-mori no omi_. _Chi-mori_ signifies “road-keeper,” and perhaps we should translate this “gentile name,” by “road-keeping grandees,” and suppose that anciently they may have performed some functions in which the bestowal of it originated.

It is chiefly known on account of its lake or pool, which is often mentioned in the early poetry. Abiko is a very rare “gentile name,” which in the “Catalogue of Family Names ”is written with the characters ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21200.jpg), but is derived by Motowori from ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21201.jpg), _i.e._, “my grandchildren.”

[^1291]: 207:86 In Yamato. The name is of uncertain origin.

[^1293]: 212:2 According to Motowori's exegesis, this name is a rather remarkable instance of verbal usage, _ayu-me_ (“trout-eyes”) being not properly part of the name at all, but only a Pillow-Word for what follows, viz., _Me-kakushi-hime_, _i.e._ “Princess Beautiful Eyes.” _Tohotsu_ is the name of a place in the province of Ki, signifying “far harbour.”

[^1303]: 213:12 Signification uncertain.

[^1304]: 213:13 The syllables _ma_ and _waka_, literally “true and young” or “truly young ”are honorific. _Iza_ is of doubtful signification.

[^1305]: 213:14 _Kuni-kata-hime_. _Kuni_ means “country,” and _kata_ here probably signifies “hard” or “firm.”

[^1306]: 213:15 _Ohiji-tsuku-yamato-hime_. _Ohiji_ probably means “a thousand,” and _Yamato_ is the name of a province. _Tsuku_ is obscure.

[^1308]: 213:17 _I.e._, “Yamato Prince.”

[^1309]: 213:18 _Kami-tsu-ke-nu_ \[_no kimi_\]. The character ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21400.jpg) (Dukes) is supplied by Motowori. This is the ancient form of the name now pronounced _Kōdzuke_ (_conf_. _Shimo-tsu-ke-nu_ corrupted to _Shimotsuke_). The author of the “Inquiry into the Meaning of the Names of All the Provinces” draws attention to the curious fact that, whereas the final syllable _nu_ of the original word is dropped in speaking, it is the _ke_ which is dropped in writing—the original form of the name, as written, being ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21401.jpg), whereas now only the first two of these three characters are used. Its signification is supposed to be “upper vegetation-moor,” _ke_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21402.jpg)) being regarded as the Archaic general term for trees and grasses, identical with _ke_ that means “hairs,” vegetation having struck the early speakers of the language as being similar to the hairs on the bodies of men and beasts.

[^1310]: 213:19 _Shimo-tsu-ke-nu no kimi_. _Shimo_ means “lower.” For the rest of the name see preceding Note. Both names are those of provinces in Eastern Japan.

[^1311]: 213:20 Or more literally, “worshipped and celebrated the festivals at,” etc.

[^1312]: 213:21 _Viz_., of the Sun-Goddess (_Ama-terasu_).

[^1313]: 213:22 _Noto no omi_. _Noto_, formerly a part of the province of Echizen, p. 215 is the name of the peninsula that juts out into the Sea of Japan on the western coast of the Main Island. The etymology of the name is obscure.

[^1314]: 213:23 The meaning of this imperfectly formed sentence is: On the occasion of “the interment of the next prince, His Augustness Yamato-hiko, the custom of setting a row of the deceased prince's retainers round his grave and burying them alive was first introduced.” For a further notice of this custom see Sect. LXXV, Note 4. According to the “Chronicles,” the “ancient” custom of burying retainers up to their necks in the neighbourhood of their lord's grave was abolished after this very same interment. Motowori endeavours to reconcile the two statements by supposing that the custom was really an old one, but that on the occasion here mentioned the number of victims was increased to an unprecedented degree, so that, as related in the “Chronicles,” their cries, while their heads were being pulled to pieces by the crows and dogs, filled the Emperor with commiseration.

[^1315]: 215:1 p. 216 Literally, “about to be exhausted.”

[^1316]: 215:2 This expression, which recurs at the commencement of Sect. CXLV, is difficult to explain. See Motowori's remarks in Vol. XXIII, pp. 24-25, and again in Vol. XL, pp. 14-15, of his Commentary.

[^1317]: 215:3 See Sect. LI, Note 12.

[^1318]: 215:4 Literally, “my august heart.”

[^1319]: 215:5 Or, “cause my shrine to be worshipped at.” The import of the god's words is that he wishes Oho-tata-ne-ko to be appointed chief priest of his temple. For the origin of this latter see the second half of Sect. XXXII (pp. [103](kj034.htm#p103)\-105).

[^1320]: 215:6 Oho signifies “great,” _Tata_ (or _Tada_) is taken to be the name of a place, and the syllables _ne_ and _ko_ are regarded as Honorifics. The p. 217 whole name may therefore, though with some hesitation, be interpreted to mean “the Lord of the Great \[Shrine of\] Tata.”

[^1321]: 215:7 _I.e._, “the divine anger shall no longer be kindled.”

[^1322]: 215:8 Mounted couriers are almost certainly intended.

[^1323]: 215:9 Literally, “distributed to the four sides,”—“four sides” being a Chinese phrase for every direction.

[^1324]: 215:10 This name may signify either “three moors ”or “august moor.” The village of Minu must not be confounded with the province of Minu.

[^1325]: 215:11 The characters used are those which properly denote the presenting of tribute to the Monarch.

[^1326]: 215:12 Here and below the First Personal Pronoun is represented by the respectful character ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21700.jpg), “servant.”

[^1327]: 216:13 See Sect. VIII, Note 7, for the explanation of this name. But probably the deity here intended is another.

[^1328]: 216:14 The etymology and signification of 'this name are alike obscure.

[^1329]: 216:15 Motowori interprets _kushi_ in the sense of “wondrous,” and _Migata_ as the name of a place, which also occurs under the form of Higata.

[^1330]: 216:16 _I.e._, “life-jewel-good-princess.”

[^1331]: 216:17 The precise signification of this name is obscure. Motowori supposes _Suwe_ to be the name of a place; _tsu_ is the Genitive Particle, and _mimi_ the Honorific of doubtful import, whose meaning has been discussed in Note 18 to Sect. XIII.

[^1332]: 216:18 The exact meaning of the characters used to write the word _kayo-nushi_ (modern _kamushi_), here rendered “high-priest,” is “owner of the Deity.” Though commonly used in modern parlance to denote any Shinto priest, it properly signifies only the chief priest in charge of a temple, whence the odd-sounding name.

[^1333]: 216:19 Or, “conduct the worship at the shrine of.”

[^1334]: 216:20 Viz., the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land. For the traditional etymology of Miwa see the legend in Sect. LXV.

[^1335]: 216:21 See Sect. XXVIII, Notes 4 and 5.

[^1336]: 216:22 Or, _Ikaga-shiko-wo_. The probable meaning of this name, pro-posed by Motowori, is (neglecting the initial letter _i_ as expletive) “the refulgent ugly male.”

[^1337]: 216:23 See Sect. I, Note 11 .

[^1338]: 216:24 _Sumisaka_ probably signifies “charcoal-hill.” Uda, which has already been mentioned in Sect. XLVI, is in Yamato. This passage may equally well be rendered thus: “to present a red-coloured shield and p. 218 spear to the Deity of Sumisaka,” and similarly in the following clause. The meaning comes nearly to the same.

[^1339]: 216:25 Literally, “great hill,” or “great pass.” It is at the boundary of the province of Yamato and Kahachi. Neither Motowori nor Tanigaha Shisei sanctions the view of the elder scholars, who fancied they saw in the distinction of red and black some mysterious import connected with the four cardinal points.

[^1340]: 216:26 In the Old Printed Edition the text of this passage differs slightly from that adopted by Motowori; but the meaning is exactly the same.

[^1341]: 216:27 A large lacuna here occurs in the “Old Printed Edition,” in which the four hundred and forty-five Chinese characters forming the original of the following part of the translation, from the words, “In consequence of this ”down to the words immediately preceding “Methinks this is a sign” on p. 180 are missing. Both the editor of 1687 and Motowori are silent as to the manner in which they supplied the deficiency; but it may be presumed from their silence that the MS. authorities furnished them with what had accidentally been omitted from the printed text.

[^1342]: 218:1 It is not easy to render literally into English the force of the characters ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21900.jpg), containing this description of the maiden's beauty, and of ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21901.jpg), in the next clause. But it is hoped that at least the translation represents them better than do Motowori's readings _kaho yokariki_ and _kaho sugata_.

[^1343]: 218:2 This word, which is not in most texts, was supplied by the editor of 1687, and is adopted by Motowori on apparently satisfactory grounds.

[^1344]: 218:3 Literally, “in the time.”

[^1345]: 218:4 The text places the word “daughter ”here, instead of in the preceding clause. For the sake of clearness, the translator has taken the liberty of transposing it.

[^1346]: 219:5 The Chinese characters are i, _i.e._, “surname and personal (what we should call ‘Christian’) name.” But Motowori's simple reading ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/21902.jpg) “name,” approves itself as probably near to the author's intention.

[^1347]: 219:6 Motowori indulges in several conjectures as to the meaning of p. 220 this detail, which, it will be seen, is not referred to in the sequel, and is therefore pointless.

[^1348]: 219:7 The same Japanese word _kagi_, which is used as the equivalent of the Chinese character ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/22000.jpg), “hook,” came in latter times to denote a key.

[^1349]: 219:8 “Three threads ”are in Japanese _mi wa_, whence the etymology of the name of Miwa given below in the text. The real derivation is altogether doubtful. The shrine of Miwa was in very early times regarded with such extraordinary reverence, that the term _Oho-gami_, “Great Deity,” unless otherwise qualified, was commonly understood to refer to the god of Miwa.

[^1350]: 219:9 _Miwa no kimi_, written simply ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/22001.jpg) (literally, “Divine Dukes,”) another sign of the estimation in which the shrine of Miwa was held.

[^1351]: 219:10 _Kama no kimi_.
