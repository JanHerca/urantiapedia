VOL. III. [^2018]

## SECT. CXIX.—EMPEROR NIN-TOKU (PART I.—GENEALOGIES).

His Augustness Oho-sazaki dwelt in the palace of Takatsu [^2019] at Naniha, and ruled the Empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded (the Empress [^2020]) Her Augustness Iha-no-hime, [^2021] daughter of Kadzuraki-no-sotsu-biko, [^2022] and begot august children: His Augustness Ohoye-no-izaho-wake; [^2023] next the Middle King of the Inlet of Sumi; [^2024] next His Augustness Midzu-ha-wake of Tajihi; [^2025] next His Augustness the Noble Wo-asadzuma-no-waku-go [^2026] (four Deities.) Again he wedded Princess Kami-naga, daughter of the Duke of Muragata in Himuka, as mentioned above, [^2027] and begot august children: Hatabi-no-oho-iratsuko, [^2028] another \[268\] name for whom was the King of Great Kusaka; [^2029] next Hatabi-no-waki-iratsume, [^2030] another name for whom was Her Augustness Princess Nagahi, [^2031] and another name was Her Augustness Waka-kusaka-be [^2032](Two Deities.) Again he wedded his younger half-sister Yata-no-waki-iratsume [^2033] Again he wedded his younger half-sister Uji-no-waki-iratsume. These two Deities had no august children. Altogether the august children of this Heavenly Sovereign Oho-sakaki \[numbered\] in all six Deities, (Five Kings and one Queen). So His Augustness Izaho-wake \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the Empire. Next His Augustness Tajihi-no midzu-ha-wake likewise ruled the Empire. Next His Augustness the Noble Oh-asadzuma-no-waku-go likewise ruled the Empire. [^2034]

## Footnotes


[^2023]: 333:1 p. 333 Literally, “lower volume”(there being three in all). See Author's Preface, Note 1.

[^2024]: 333:2 _I.e._, “high port.”

[^2025]: 333:3 p. 334 Motowori surmises that the reason why the characters signifying “Empress” are in all the text here written in small characters is on account of this personage not having been of Imperial birth.

[^2026]: 333:4 _I.e._, “the rock princess.” Motowori supposes the name to be indicative of prosperity and long life.

[^2027]: 333:5 See Sect. LXI, Note 55,

[^2028]: 333:6 _I.e._, “the elder brother lord Izaho,” the latter name being of uncertain import.

[^2029]: 333:7 _Sumi-no ye-no-naka-tsu-miko_. Both the phrase “middle king” and the Inlet of Sumi have been already commented on.

[^2030]: 333:8 _Tajihi no midzu-ha-wake_. Tajihi is the name of a place in Kahachi. The traditional origin of its application to this will be found in Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXXV, p. 6. _Midzu-ha-wake_ probably means “the lord with the beautiful teeth.”

[^2031]: 333:9 _Wo-asadzuma-no-waku-go no sukune_. Asadzuma is the name of a place in Yamato, and _wo_ (though written ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/33400.jpg)) seems to be the slightly Honorific Prefix _wo_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/33401.jpg)) whose proper signification is “small” _Waku-go_ means “younger child.”

[^2032]: 333:10 See Sect. CVII.

[^2033]: 333:11 _I.e._, “the great lord of Hatabi.” _Hatabi_ is altogether obscure.

[^2034]: 333:12 _Oha-kusaka no miko_. For _Kusaka_ see Sect. CI, Note 2.

[^2035]: 333:13 _I.e._, “the young lady of Hatabi.” Conf. Note 1 I.

[^2036]: 333:14 _Nagahi-hime_. This name is obscure.

[^2037]: 333:15 _Kusaka-be_ is an alternative form of _Kusaka_. The compound therefore signifies “young princess of Kusaka.”

[^2038]: 333:16 This name and the following have already appeared in the genealogies of the preceding reign (Sect. CIV.)

[^2039]: 333:17 These were the Emperors Ri-chiu, Han-zei, and In-giyo.

[^2040]: 334:1 p. 335 _Kadzuraki be_. For Kadzuraki see Sect. LV, Note 1.

[^2041]: 335:2 _Mibu-be_. Motowori quotes approvingly a derivation of the “gentile name” of Mibu from _Bi-fuku-mon_ ( ![](/image/book/Shintoism/The_Kojiki/33500.jpg)), the name of a gate which the first bearer of the name is related to have constructed. Taking into account the letter-changes which occurred in older times in the passage of words from Chinese into Japanese, the etymology is plausible enough.

[^2042]: 335:3 _Tajihi-be_. Tajihi is the name of a place in Kahachi, and is of uncertain origin.

[^2043]: 335:4 _Oho-kusaka-be_. This tribe of course took its name simply from that of Prince Oho-kusaka.

[^2044]: 335:5 _Waka-kusaka-be_. A similar observation to that in the last applies to this name.

[^2045]: 335:6 See Sect. LIII, Note I.

[^2046]: 335:7 _Wani no ike_, in the province of Kahachi. _Wani_ signifies “crocodile,” and it was also the name of the Korean personage mentioned in Sect. CX (Note 6). But the reason why the Pool here spoken of was so called does net appear. The Pool of Yosami has already been mentioned in Sect. LXII (Note 85). Motowori supposes that it must have dried up during the interim.

[^2047]: 335:8 _Naniha no hori-ye_. Motowori tells us that the regularization of p. 336 the channels of the Yodo and Yamato Rivers, whose mouths nearly meet at this point with various intersecting branches, is what is here intended to be referred to.

[^2048]: 335:9 _Wobashi no ye_. _Wo-bashi_ (“little bridge”) is the name of a village in the province of Settsu.

[^2049]: 335:10 _Suminoye no tsu_. Close of Naniha; it is the modern _Sumiyoshi_. Conf. Sect. X, Note 22.
