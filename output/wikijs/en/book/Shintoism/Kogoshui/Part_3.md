[1](../Part_2#fr_1) 1. Japan was so termed in ancient times.

<a id="note_2"></a>

[2](../Part_2#fr_2) 2. _I.e._, Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami or the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Goddess. The Goddess has an aspect of the deification of the sun as well as a trace of a human ancestress who once actually existed.

<a id="note_3"></a>

[3](../Part_2#fr_3) 3. In ancient Japanese mythology, the name of the Moon-God is Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto or His-Augustness-Moon-Night-Possessor (or Moon-Night-Darkness), _i.e._, the God of the Night-Dominion.

<a id="note_4"></a>

[4](../Part_2#fr_4) 4. Correctly expressed, Takehaya-Susano-O-no-Mikoto or His-Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness is surely the deification of the rainstorm, although we admit that there are also some traces of an historical human being in him.

<a id="note_5"></a>

[5](../Part_2#fr_5) 5. _Vide_ Dr. G. Katō’s Article on _Ame-no-Minakanushi-no-Kami_ in _T.A.S.J._, as regards this God, who probably is the highest God worshipped in the so-called primitive monotheism of Japan.

<a id="note_6"></a>

[6](../Part_2#fr_6) 6. (1) In the Maeda manuscripts, (2) in the manuscript of the _Kogoshūi_ to which reference is made by Mikannagi-Kiyonao (a Shintō priest of the Ise Shrine), as being preserved in the house of a certain Kawasaki-Kiyoatsu, (3) in the book _Kogoshūi-Genyosho_ by Tatsuno-Hirochika (Japanese edition, vol. I, p. 10), (4) in the textual passage of the _Kogoshūi_ quoted in the _Ruiju-Jingi-Hongen_ p. 58 (Japanese edition, vol. III, p. 21. The _Zoku-Zoku-Gunsho-Ruijū_), (5) in the _Gengenshū_ (Japanese edition, vol. II, p. 11), etc., we read:

“When Heaven and Earth separated, the God named Ame-no-Minakanushi-no-Kami, who was born in the midst of Heaven, had three sons of whom the eldest, Takami-Musubi-no-Kami, _i.e._, Sumeragamutsu-Kamurogi-no-Mikoto, is the ancestor of the Tomo and Saeki families; the second son, Tsuhaya-Musubi-no-Kami, _i.e._, Sumeragamutsu-Kamuromi-no-Mikoto, is the ancestor of the Nakatomi family of Asomi rank; and the youngest one, Kamumi-Musubi-no-Kami, is the ancestor of the Ki family of Atae rank.”

In the divine genealogy of the _Sendai-Kuji-Hongi_, Tsuhaya-Musubi-no-Mikoto (the word “Mikoto” is used indifferently with “Kami”) has a son, called Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto, who is the ancestor of the Nakatomi family of Muraji rank (_I.e._, the seventh of the eight classes of nobility created by the Emperor Temmu in A.D. 684, and given to the heads of certain corporations. _Vide_ the _Sendai-Kuji-Hongi_. The _Kokushi-Taikei_, Japanese edition, vol. VII, p. 177).

In the _Shinsen-Shōjiroku_ or _Catalogue of Family Names Newly Compiled by Prince Manta_, the writer states that Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto is the great grandson of Tsuhaya-Musubi-no-Kami (_Vide_ the late Prof. Kurita, The _Shinsen-Shōjiroku-Kōshō_ or _Commentary on the Catalogue of Family Names Newly Compiled by Prince_ p. 59 _Manta_, Japanese edition, vol. VIII, pp. 537, 538. vol. XVI, p. 1017).

<a id="note_7"></a>

[7](../Part_2#fr_7) 7. _Vide_ Sir Ernest Satow’s Article on the _Toshigoi-Matsuri-no-Norito_ or _Shintō Ritual of Praying for Harvest_, elucidating the meaning of the names Sumeragamutsu-Kamurogi and Kamuromi-no-Mikoto (_T.A.S.J._, vol. VII, p. 114).

<a id="note_8"></a>

[8](../Part_2#fr_8) 8. The second of the eight classes of Court Nobles established by the Emperor Temmu (A.D. 684). The eight classes are:—the first Mabito, the second Asomi, the third Sukune, the fourth Imiki, the fifth Michi-no-Shi, the sixth Omi, the seventh Muraji, and the eighth Inaki. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. II. p. 365.

<a id="note_9"></a>

[9](../Part_2#fr_9) 9. In the _Nihongi_, he is called Amatsu-Hiko-Hikoho-no-Ninigi-no-Mikoto. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 64.

<a id="note_10"></a>

[10](../Part_2#fr_10) 10. The third of the eight classes of Court Nobles. The title implies an hereditary rank of nobility.

<a id="note_11"></a>

[11](../Part_2#fr_11) 11. In the _Nihongi_ version, the ancestor of the Imbe family of Ki-I Province. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 81.

<a id="note_12"></a>

[12](../Part_2#fr_12) 12. Ha-Akarutama in one account of the _Nihongi_ appears to be Kushi-Akarutama-no-Mikoto. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 37. The late Prof. Kurita of the Tōkyō Imperial University identified Kushi-Akarutama-no-Mikoto with Toyo-tama-Hime-no-Mikoto of the _Nihongi_ (_ibid._, vol. I, p. 47) and Ame-no-Akarutama of the same book (_ibid._, vol. I, p. 49). _Vide_ the late Prof. Kurita’s _Shinsen-Shōjiroku-Kōshō_ or _Commentary_ p. 60 _on the Catalogue of Family Names Newly Compiled by Prince Manta_ (Japanese edition, vol. XI, p. 791).

The Tamatsukuri or Jewel-making family is a sub-division of the Imbe family resident in Izumo Province.

<a id="note_13"></a>

[13](../Part_2#fr_13) 13. In ancient Japan, a rare jewel being regarded as a divine object, possessed a magical influence, and was a kind of fetish; so, for the simple-minded Japanese of old, it was possible that through the magical virtue of the jewels a child was born.

In the _Sendai-Kuji-Hongi_, the Japanese reader is very familiar with a certain jewel of magical virtue, called “Makaru-Kaeshi-no-Tama,” _i.e._, the “Jewel endowed with a miraculous power of restoring the dead to life” (_Vide_ the _Kokushi-Taikei_, Japanese edition, vol. VII, pp. 321, 322).

The _Nihongi_ also mentions two notable magical gems, which Hikohohodemi-no-Mikoto used as amulets, talismans or charms, in time of peril. They are known as the Shiomitsu-Ni and Shiohiru-Ni, _i.e._, the Tide-flowing and Tide-ebbing Jewels (_Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 94).

The _Kojiki_ mentions a divinized jewel, which being the necklace of the God Izanagi was actually regarded as a divinity called Mikuratana-no-Kami (B. H. Chamberlain, _E.T.K._, p. 43).

From the _Kojiki_ we learn that the divine emblem of the Himekoso Shrine is a crimson jewel (B. H. Chamberlain, _E.T.K._, p. 258).

<a id="note_14"></a>

[14](../Part_2#fr_14) 14. Akatsu-no-Mikoto is an abbreviation of Masaka-Akatsu-Kachihayahi-Ame-no-Oshihomimi-no-Mikoto, p. 61 usually abbreviated as Ame-no-Oshihomimi-no-Mikoto (B. H. Chamberlain, _ibid._, pp. 48, 93).

As regards the expression “wakigo” in connection with this, _vide_ K. A. Florenz’s German translation of the _Kogoshūi_ (_Die Historischen Quellen der Shintō-Religion_, S. 448) and Nasa-Katsutaka’s _Giosai_. Imbe-no-Hironari’s etymological explanation of the words “wakigo” and “wakago” is hardly credible.

<a id="note_15"></a>

[15](../Part_2#fr_15) 15. This passage will bear three constructions; _viz._, the first being that of the author of the _Kogoshūi_: Susano-O’s “Setting up rods at the rice-fields” may indicate that he claimed the possession of the rice-fields. Sometimes he used dividing ropes, in place of rods, as signs of ownership. Secondly, as Aston thinks, “Setting up combs at the rice-fields” might be interpreted as having a magical meaning, but this explanation is not quite satisfactory (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 48). And thirdly, we ourselves rather agree with Dr. K. A. Florenz who interpreted the action of erecting rods in the deep mud of the rice-fields to be simply a mischievous design to injure the barefooted Japanese peasantry labouring in the paddy fields (K. A. Florenz, English translation of the _Ōharai-no-Norito_. _T.A.S.J._, vol. XXVII, pp. 80, 81).

<a id="note_16"></a>

[16](../Part_2#fr_16) 16. The author of the _Kogoshūi_, misled by the Chinese character “he” (戶) which literally means “door,” gave the above-quoted interpretation, but the true meaning of the word p. 62 “kusohe” is simply “to discharge excreta,” and in the present instance, as regards both the _Kojiki_ and _Nihongi_ accounts, it can be readily seen that the rude Susano-O-no-Kami’s bad intention was to pollute his divine sister’s Sacred Hall before the Autumnal Harvest Festival, by evacuating his excreta in that building

<a id="note_17"></a>

[17](../Part_2#fr_17) 17. “Ame-no-Yasu-no-Kawara” in Japanese. Aston translates as “The Bank of the Tranquil River of Heaven,” but he seems to have been misled by the Chinese characters used in the _Nihongi_, and so to have rendered them too literally. The true meaning seems to be that which we have rendered into English in the present text.

<a id="note_18"></a>

[18](../Part_2#fr_18) 18. According to the _Ōtonohogai-no-Norito_ or _Ritual of the Luck-wishing of the Great-Palace_ (_Ritual for Bringing Good Fortune to the Great Palace_), not “measures of varying size,” but “consecrated axes, large and small,” may seem to be meant. _Vide_ Sir E. Satow, _Ancient Japanese Rituals_, part III, No. 8 (_T.A.S.J._).

<a id="note_19"></a>

[19](../Part_2#fr_19) 19. According to the _Nihongi_ (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 43), the Yasakani, or Yasaka Jewels, _i.e._, the Ever-bright Curved Jewels.

<a id="note_20"></a>

[20](../Part_2#fr_20) 20. The identity of this tree is uncertain. Some Japanese commentators say that the word “oke” was probably inserted here by mistake.

<a id="note_21"></a>

[21](../Part_2#fr_21) 21. With regard to the parallel passages in the _Kojiki_ and the _Nihongi_, “ukefuse” signifies “to put a tub bottom upwards,” p. 63 and in this instance Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto performed a divine dance on the tub, stamping until it resounded like a drum, and thereby coming into union with the Divine, _i.e._, as though she were herself possessed by the divine spirit. The original expression “ukefuse” never conveys the idea of an oath, which the author of the _Kogoshūi_ erroneously accepted.

<a id="note_22"></a>

[22](../Part_2#fr_22) 22. “Shimenawa” is the ordinary form of the rather archaic “shirikumenawa.” According to B. H. Chamberlain, in perfect agreement with the learned Moto-Ori, “shirikumenawa” denotes straw rope so constructed that the roots of the straw project and are visible at the end of the rope. Moto-Ori’s explanation shows that this is more likely to be the proper significance of the word than “back-limiting-rope” (“shirihe-kagiri-me-nawa”) which, as Kamo-Mabuchi had previously suggested, might have originated when the event narrated in the legend was described (B. H. Chamberlain, _E.T.K._, p. 59). According to our view, “shime” may mean “to forbid,” just as “shimeno” denotes a “forbidden field,” so that the land encircled by a rope is simply taboo, _i.e._, a sacred precinct forbidden to be approached or trodden upon by ordinary unclean feet. Since the entrance to the Rock-Cave was barred by a similar rope, this “shimeno” was probably a tabooed forbidden ground or sanctuary, which laymen must not enter. We cannot understand the explanation given in a note in the _Kogoshūi_ that this rope represents “the sun’s shadow.”

<span id="p64"><sup><small>[ p. 64 ]</small></sup></span>

<a id="note_23"></a>

[23](../Part_2#fr_23) 23. _I.e._, the Goddess of the Great August Palace. Sir Ernest Satow considers that this Goddess is simply a “Personification of the successive generations of the Mikado’s consorts” (_T.A.S.J._, vol. VII, p. 122). _Vide_ note [56](#note_56).

<a id="note_24"></a>

[24](../Part_2#fr_24) 24. Literally, “tayo” means “abundant, strong or powerful,” and “iwa” “rock,” but in this case its true meaning is “strong, enduring, eternal,” and “mado” is a “window,” or “gate.” So Toyo-Iwamado-no-Mikoto signifies “the Powerful God of the Strong Gate.”

<a id="note_25"></a>

[25](../Part_2#fr_25) 25. Kushi-Iwamado-no-Mikoto means “the Wonderful God of the Strong Gate.”

<a id="note_26"></a>

[26](../Part_2#fr_26) 26. The culture hero Ōnamuchi-no-Kami is better known as Ōkuninushi-no-Kami, who first ruled over Izumo Province, as a local god.

<a id="note_27"></a>

[27](../Part_2#fr_27) 27. Nowadays it is very difficult to ascertain the location of the Tokoyo-no-Kuni, for it is referred to in different ways by the _Kojiki_ and the _Nihongi_. In our opinion, the word Tokoyo-no-Kuni possibly had three different meanings: the first, literally speaking, being the “Eternal Land,” or the “Land of Eternal Bliss,” or “Paradise”; the second, the “Land of Eternal Night-Darkness” or “Underworld”; and the third, a most distant country, although it exists somewhere on the earth, very far away from Japan.

<a id="note_28"></a>

[28](../Part_2#fr_28) 28. According to the _Nihongi_, this Edict was issued by Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami alone (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 77).

<span id="p65"><sup><small>[ p. 65 ]</small></sup></span>

<a id="note_29"></a>

[29](../Part_2#fr_29) 29. Both the _Kojiki_ and _Nihongi_ accounts of this tradition mention three Sacred Treasures, namely, the Jewels, the Mirror, and the Sword, which have been handed down in the Imperial family as the Divine Heirlooms, without whose possession no Emperor can legitimately ascend the Throne of Japan. However, the _Ōtonohogai_—a Shintō Ritual in the _Engishiki_ (10th century A.D.)—mentions only the Sacred Mirror and the Divine Sword, in this agreeing with the _Jingiryō_ or _Shintō Administrative Law_ in the 8th century A.D. Clearly, therefore, Imbe-no-Hironari mentioned this fact, as it is stated in the _Jingiryō_ and in the _Ōtonohogai_, but the oldest traditions clearly include the Jewels in the Divine Imperial Heirloom, and that there are three is the universally held belief as witnessed by the expression “Sanshu-no-Shinki” (Three Kinds of Divine Insignia). In the _Nihongi_ it is not two deities (Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami and Takami-Musubi-no-Kami), but only one deity (Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami) that confers the Divine Imperial Heirloom upon the Heavenly Grandson (_Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 76).

<a id="note_30"></a>

[30](../Part_2#fr_30) 30. In one account the _Nihongi_ ascribes this Edict to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami alone, and he who receives her command is not the Heavenly Grandson but her son Ame-no-Oshihomimi-no-Mikoto. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 83.

<a id="note_31"></a>

[31](../Part_2#fr_31) 31. In both the _Kojiki_ and _Nihongi_ accounts, five instead of three heavenly attendants, called the “Gods of the Five Hereditary Corporations”, are mentioned—the two additional divinities being Ishikoritome-no-Mikoto and Tamanoya-no-Mikoto.

<span id="p66"><sup><small>[ p. 66 ]</small></sup></span>

<a id="note_32"></a>

[32](../Part_2#fr_32) 32. The _Nihongi_ ascribes the first half (“We.....welfare of the Heavenly Grandson”) of this Edict to Takami-Musubi-no-Kami alone. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, pp. 81, 82.

<a id="note_33"></a>

[33](../Part_2#fr_33) 33. In the _Nihongi_, the words of this Edict, “Guarding him in your attendance under the same roof against all emergencies,” are ascribed to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami alone (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 83).

<a id="note_34"></a>

[34](../Part_2#fr_34) 34. The passage, “Serving him with the rice of the consecrated above,” is ascribed to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami alone in the _Nihongi_ account. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 83.

<a id="note_35"></a>

[35](../Part_2#fr_35) 35. Certain commentators on the _Kujiki_ (_Chronicles of the Old Matters of Former Ages_) explain that “those Gods” are the Thirty-Two Gods, mentioned in the _Kujiki_, who, besides the “Gods of the Five Hereditary Corporations,” accompanied the Heavenly Grandson towards the earth.

<a id="note_36"></a>

[36](../Part_2#fr_36) 36. The _Nihongi_ ascribes the Edict to Takami-Musubi-no-Kami alone. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I,. p. 81.

<a id="note_37"></a>

[37](../Part_2#fr_37) 37. _I.e._, Chimata-no-Kami.

<a id="note_38"></a>

[38](../Part_2#fr_38) 38. Later, Saruta-Hiko, Ame-no-Uzume, Chimata-no-Kami (or the God Yachimata-Hiko and the Goddess Yachimata-Hime), Sae-no-Kami, Dōsojin, and Funado-no-Kami constitute a class of Japanese phallic gods (as well as guardian gods of travellers and p. 67 divine warders against epidemic diseases), and curiously enough Saruta-Hiko, an ancient phallic god, is represented as a moral teacher in the writings of certain authors (_e.g._, Yamazaki-Ansai) during the Tokugawa Régime.

<a id="note_39"></a>

[39](../Part_2#fr_39) 39. _Cf._ B. H. Chamberlain, _E.T.K._, p. 110, note 33 and p. 113, note 2.

<a id="note_40"></a>

[40](../Part_2#fr_40) 40. According to the compilers of the _Nihongi_, this is Hiko-nagisatake-Ugaya-Fuki-Aezu-no-Mikoto, who is no other than the father of Japan’s first human Emperor, Jimmu-Tennō, whose enthronement ceremony took place, according to tradition, in 660 B.C.

<a id="note_41"></a>

[41](../Part_2#fr_41) 41. Most modern scholars, whether native or foreign, are of opinion that the reign of that Emperor really began some hundreds of years later.

<a id="note_42"></a>

[42](../Part_2#fr_42) 42. The Emperor Jimmu started on an expedition for the so-called “Eastern Conquest” from Kyūshū, the western districts of Japan, to Yamato in the east, so the “eastern provinces” here referred to denotes the Yamato districts.

<a id="note_43"></a>

[43](../Part_2#fr_43) 43. By this Nagasune-Hiko is meant. He was one of the most stubborn opponents of the Emperor Jimmu and was killed by Nigihayahi-no-Mikoto, according to the _Nihongi_ account (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 128).

<a id="note_44"></a>

[44](../Part_2#fr_44) 44. According to the _Nihongi_, this man met the Emperor Jimmu at the port of Hayasui in Bungo Province and was employed in the service of the Imperial army whilst _en route_ to Usa in Buzen Province, and afterwards he was ordered to ascend Mt. Kagu in p. 68 Yamato in disguise and there obtain a small lump of earth which it was indispensable to use when invoking the gods for victory. He succeeded in bringing it back safely to the Imperial camp despite the vigilance of his foes (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 112).

<a id="note_45"></a>

[45](../Part_2#fr_45) 45. _Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 116.

<a id="note_46"></a>

[46](../Part_2#fr_46) 46. In archaic Japanese “mi-araka” means “august or divine abode,” _i.e._, “Imperial Palace.”

<a id="note_47"></a>

[47](../Part_2#fr_47) 47. Here the Sovereign Grandson means the Emperor Jimmu.

<a id="note_48"></a>

[48](../Part_2#fr_48) 48. “Miki” means “august wood,” _i.e._, “sacred timbers.”

<a id="note_49"></a>

[49](../Part_2#fr_49) 49. This is another Awa in the Kantō, in contradistinction to that of Shikoku, where the descendants of Hiwashi-no-Mikoto dwelt. It is often called Bōshū, and is now a portion of Chiba Prefecture. So in this text Awa-Kōri means the present Awa or Bōshū Province.

<a id="note_50"></a>

[50](../Part_2#fr_50) 50. _I.e._, Takami-Musubi-no-Kami and Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami, according to the author of the _Kogoshūi_.

<a id="note_51"></a>

[51](../Part_2#fr_51) 51. _Vide_ [p. 17](../Part2#p17).

<a id="note_52"></a>

[52](../Part_2#fr_52) 52. _Vide_ [p. 17](../Part2#p17).

<a id="note_53"></a>

[53](../Part_2#fr_53) 53. This is a divine spirit who takes charge of a person’s soul and prevents it from going astray, leaving its body behind. Hence, we have the Mitamashizume-no-Matsuri or Ceremony for Calming the August Spirit of an Emperor at the Enthronement p. 69 Ceremony (_Vide_ W. G. Aston, _Shintō,_ or _the Way of the Gods_, p. 292).

<a id="note_54"></a>

[54](../Part_2#fr_54) 54. This is a Divine Spirit who inspires men with life.

<a id="note_55"></a>

[55](../Part_2#fr_55) 55. Through the influence of this Divine Spirit, one’s physical health is received and invigorated. This God is probably another aspect of the Divine Spirit Iku-Musubi.

<a id="note_56"></a>

[56](../Part_2#fr_56) 56. _Vide_ pp. [22](../Part2#p22), [64](#p64). In the Shintō Ritual of _Ōtonohogai_ (_Luck-wishing or Blessing of the Great Palace_) or _Shintō Prayer to the Guardian Gods of the Imperial Palace_ the favour of the same Goddess is invoked for the protection of the Imperial Palace from every ill. Hirata identified this Goddess with Ame-no-Uzume or Miyabi-no-Kami (Hirata-Atsutane, The _Miyami-no-Kami-Godenki_. The C_ollected Works_, Japanese edition, vol. XV, note 20 b).

<a id="note_57"></a>

[57](../Part_2#fr_57) 57. This is a divine son of Ōkuninushi-no-Kami of Izumo Province, who, on Kotoshironushi’s stern warning, willingly sacrificed his life through loyalty to the Emperor, after surrendering the governance of his country to the Heavenly Grandson Ninigi-no-Mikoto. So to the end Kotoshironushi-no-Kami remained exceedingly faithful to the Imperial cause, and therefore according to some Japanese commentators he was afterwards looked up to as one of the guardian spirits of the Imperial House.

<a id="note_58"></a>

[58](../Part_2#fr_58) 58. _I.e._, the Goddess of Food; hence some of the Japanese commentators have identified her with Toyouke-Hime or Toyouke-Daijin of the Outer Shrine in Ise.

<span id="p70"><sup><small>[ p. 70 ]</small></sup></span>

<a id="note_59"></a>

[59](../Part_2#fr_59) 59. _I.e._, the Shintō Priestesses at the Imperial Court who were attached to the Jingikan or Department for the Worship of the Shintō Gods.

<a id="note_60"></a>

[60](../Part_2#fr_60) 60. Kushi-Iwamado-no-Kami (_supra_ [note 25](#note_25)), the Wonderful God of the Strong Gate, _i.e._, the Divine-Wonderful-Strong-Gate-Keeper. Toyo-Iwamado-no-Kami (_supra_ [note 24](#note_24)), the Powerful God of the Strong Gate, _i.e._, the Divine-Abundant-Strong-Gate-Keeper. Moto-Ori suggests that either name is used in the _Kojiki_ (Moto-Ori, The _Kojiki-Den_ or Commentary on the _Kojiki_, vol. XV. The _Collected Works_, Japanese edition, vol. I, p. 877) to indicate one and the same God, Ame-no-Iwatowake-no-Kami. Both Gods are divine guardians of the Imperial Gates, according to one of the Shintō Rituals of the _Engishiki_ or _Institutes of the Engi Period_ (A.D. 901-923). As regards the eight deities enshrined at the Jingikan, _i.e._, the Department for the Worship of the Shintō Gods, Sir Ernest Satow’s learned comments deserve our attention (_Vide_ _T.A.S.J._, vol. VII, p. 109 and pp. 120-123).

[61](../Part_2#fr_61) 61. What the “God of Ikushima” really means is not very clear, but it appears to be the chief local guardian spirit by whose virtue the locality or country (region or island) exists.

[63](../Part_2#fr_63) 63. The meaning of the word “Ikasuri” is a burning question in learned disputations, but it seems to us that the Gods are special guardian spirits of the Imperial Court-Grounds. According to the commentators Ikebe and Kubo, “Ikasuri” is p. 71 “Igashiri” which means “dwelling place,” hence the word “Ikasuri” in the text means the grounds of the Imperial Court, and the author of the _Kogoshūi_ probably understood by it the special guardian spirits of the Imperial Court-Grounds.

[64](../Part_2#fr_64) 64. The sword here referred to is the Murakumo Sword, which Susano-O-no-Mikoto found in the tail of the monster serpent when he slew it in Izumo; and the Yata-no-Kagami or Eight-hand-span or Large Mirror is believed to be the same mirror which Ishikoritome-no-Mikoto constructed and with which he induced the Sun-Goddess Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami to quit her retreat in the Rock-Cave and restore blessings to mankind by illuminating the heavens and the earth with the radiance of her bounteous light.

[66](../Part_2#fr_66) 66. By this Imbe-no-Hironari may mean either some other book than the _Kogoshūi_ that he himself wrote, or a book very well known to him, but the reader should not mistake it for the _Engishiki_, which was not yet compiled in Hironari’s time.

The earthly offences mentioned in the _Engishiki_ or _Institutes of the Engi Period_ are the following: “Abnormal offences against nature, such as cutting the living skin; cutting the dead skin; being an albino; being affected with excrescences; the offence of a son’s intercourse with his own mother, or that of a father with his own daughter; the offence of one’s cohabiting with both a mother and her daughter; the offence of cohabiting with animals; calamity caused by crawling worms (or accidents through being bitten by snakes or centipedes, etc.); calamity brought by the gods on high (or calamity sent by the Thunder-Gods, _i.e._, being struck by lightning); calamity caused by the birds on high (calamity caused, or damage done, by birds in the air); killing animals belonging to other people; the offence of using magical incantations.”

I have here taken the liberty to quote with slight alteration from Dr. K. A. Florenz’s English translation of the _Ōharai-no-Norito_ or _Ritual of the Great Purification_ (_T.A.S.J._, vol.XXVII, p. 61).

<a id="note_74"></a>

[74](../Part_2#fr_74) 74. The meaning of this song is not quite clear. Even the Japanese commentators find difficulties in apprehending it, and differ in their explanations. The song may mean:—

“What a delightfully happy evening this grand banquet gives us courtiers, who at the Ceremony of the Removing of the Divine Insignia greatly enjoy ourselves throughout the whole night! O how auspicious is the snow scene this night!”

Or, the song may be read as follows:—

“We courtiers present at the Ceremony of the Removal of the Divine Insignia now enjoy great pleasure at the grand banquet throughout the whole night in the fine sacred Yuki Hall!”

As we see above, some commentators understand “snow” by the word “yuki,” whilst others interpret it as the name of a Shintō Worship Hall (or Pavilion), “Yuki” (or “Yuki-Den”), which is newly built for the Shintō Rites held at each Emperor’s Enthronement.

Taking into consideration what Ban-Nobutomo suggests in his autographic annotations to the _Kogoshūi_ and in reference to certain passages in the _Nihon-Sandai-Jitsuroku_ describing the scenes of the Daijō Feast at the Enthronement Ceremony of the Emperor Kōkō on the 23rd and 25th days of the 11th month in p. 74 the 8th year (A.D. 884) of Gengyō (_Vide_ the _Nihon-Sandai-Jitsuroku_, vol. XLVI. The _Kokushi-Taikei_, Japanese edition, vol. IV, p. 648), we may interpret the obscure meaning of the song as follows:

“Let us courtiers make merry the whole night through! Oh, how fine for us courtiers is the sacred ‘sake’ drink!”

“What a fine long robe each courtier wears at the Ceremony of Removing the Divine Insignia; it reaches below the knees!”

<a id="note_75"></a>

[75](../Part_2#fr_75) 75. According to Tachibana-no-Moribe, one of the ablest scholars of the Tokugawa Régime, it reads as follows:—

“The courtiers’ fine long robes, reaching below the knees; how magnificent they look!”

(_Vide_ Tachibana-no-Moribe, The _Kagura-Uta-Iriaya_. The _Moribe-Zenshū_ or _Collected Works_, Japanese edition, vol. VII, p. 57).

Another interpretation advanced by Ikebe-no-Mahari for the first song in question is this:

“We courtiers have enjoyed ourselves greatly until late at night, singing, dancing, and gently striking the knees with our hands. O how happy and pleasant it is to-night at the Ceremony of Removing the Divine Insignia!”

The same author renders the meaning of the second song as follows:

“What a fine, long robe each courtier in the suite wears at the Ceremony of the Removing of the Divine Insignia! It reaches to the knees. Oh, how splendid is the procession to the Divine p. 75 Insignia!”

_Vide_ Ikebe-no-Mahari, The _Kogoshūi-Shinchu_, or _A New Commentary on the Kogoshūi_, Japanese edition, vol. VI, p. 22.

_Cf._ B.H. Chamberlain, _E.T.K._, p. 298. The Emperor Ingyō.

Two other similar songs of the same sort, according to the _Kōtaijingū-Gishikichō_, were sung at the Ise Shrine of the Sun-Goddess, on the occasion of the Sacred Feast. These songs are:

“The courtiers are enjoying themselves very much striking their knees gently, the sound re-echoes through the Sacred Hall!”

“At the joyous divine feast in the Sacred Hall at Isuzu, the sound of the courtiers’ striking their knees echoes and re-echoes all over the Hall!”

(The _Kōtaijingū-Gishikichō_ or _Book on the Ceremonial Rites for Each Month round the Whole Year at the Inner Shrine of Ise_. The _Gunsho-Ruijū_ edited by the Keizaizasshi-Sha, vol. I, p. 39).

The author of the _Kogoshūi_ took the Abstinence Palace to be the abode of the Guardian Priestess Yamato-Hime-no-Mikoto, but this is incorrect. That the palace or shrine was for the Sun-Goddess herself is proved by the description given in the _Nihongi_.

“In compliance, therefore, with the instruction of the Great Goddess, a shrine was erected to her in the province of Ise. Accordingly, an Abstinence Palace was built beside the River Isuzu” (_Vide_ W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, pp. 41, 176).

Moto-Ori and Kubo agreed with the view expressed by the compilers of The _Nihongi_ (Moto-Ori, The _Kojiki-Den_, vol. XV. The _Collected Works_, Japanese edition, vol. I, p. 859. Kubo, The _Kogoshūi-Kogi_ or _Studies and Notes on the Kogoshūi_, p. 90).

According to the _Kojiki_ and the _Engishiki_, the Izushi Shrine is Sacred to the Eight Divine Objects, which Ame-no-Hihoko brought with him to Japan.

[83](../Part_2#fr_83) 83. Legend ascribes several miraculous virtues to this Sword.

Not only did Susano-O-no-Kami obtain it by slaying the p. 77 monster serpent or Japanese Python, whose tail contained it, but tradition has it that wherever the Sword might be, there also was a mass of clouds. Moreover, according to the _Nihongi_ tradition (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 205), it was by its miraculous power that Prince Yamatotakeru himself narrowly escaped being burnt to death by his treacherous enemy in the field of Yaitsu in Suruga Province. It is surely a divine object whose supernatural presence protected the Hero-Prince from personal danger, and the primitive natives regarded it as divine, although modern critics assert that it was some kind of talisman or fetish. Wherever that Sword was, the Prince was safe (as the _Kogoshūi_ relates), whilst through its absence he was finally led to ruin, when climbing Mt. Ibuki. In old Japan the sword was considered to be endowed with supernatural, miraculous powers. The same is true of the Kusanagi Sword. Compare the chapter “On the Sword” in the _Heike-Monogatari_, where the miraculous virtues of the sword are specifically described (A. L. Sadler’s English translation of the _Heike-Monogatari_, the _Book of Swords_, _T.A.S.J._, vol. XLIX, p. 325).

<a id="note_84"></a>

[84](../Part_2#fr_84) 84. According to the _Nihongi_ (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 241) and the _Shoryō-Shiki_ of the _Engishiki_ (The _Kokushi-Taikei_, Japanese edition, vol. XIII, p. 677), we may assert with some show of probability that the Empress Jingo dwelt in the Wakasakura Palace at Iware, in Toichi-Kōri, Yamato Province, although the learned Moto-Ori in his _Kojiki-Den_ discussed and contradicted p. 78 such a view (Moto-Ori, The _Collected Works_, Japanese edition, vol. III, pp. 2229-2231).

[90](../Part_2#fr_90) 90. “Wakasakura” literally means “early cherry blossoms.” According to the _Nihongi_ (W .G. Aston _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 307), when the Emperor Richū made a feast in a boat on the Pond of p. 79 Ichishi at Iware, a cherry blossom flowering out of season in winter fell into the Emporor’s cup of “sake,” and this incident particularly attracting the Emperor’s attention, His Majesty was pleased to name his palace after it, and the author of the _Kogoshūi_ called it “Nochi-no-Iware-Wakasakura-no-Miya” or “Later Iware-Wakasakura Palace” in contradistinction to the palace of the same name at Iware where the Empress Jingō had dwelt. Aston throws doubt on the origin of the name, pointing out that Jingō’s palace had already borne the same title. The present commentators however are of different opinion and consider that there is no doubt that the Emperor Richū dwelt in the Wakasakura Palace and that it owed its name to the pretty story of the _Nihongi_ mentioned above. In support of their opinion, they would point out that the name of the Empress Jingō’s palace is mentioned only in a note in the _Nihongi_ (The _Kokushi-Taikei_, Japanese edition, vol. I, p. 170), and that it is not as is customary given in the main text describing the chief events at the beginning of her reign. It should be mentioned moreover that the copy of _Nihongi_ made during the Eikyō Era (15th century) omits this note entirely (Iida-Takesato, The _Nihonshoki-Tsūshaku_, Japanese edition, vol. XXXVI, p. 1955). It is true the text mentions that, in the 69th year of her reign the Empress Jingō died in the Wakasakura Palace, but it must be remembered that the _Nihongi_ was not compiled till the 4th year of Yōrō (A.D. 720) in the Empress Genshō’s reign, and the name Wakasakura becomes prominent for the p. 80 first time in the reign of the Emperor Richū when we find the Wakasakura-Be (Corporation) formed. It was also bestowed during the Emperor Richū’s reign as a family name. _Vide_ the _Kojiki_ (B. H. Chamberlain, _E.T.K._, p. 291), the _Nihongi_ (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, pp. 306, 307) and the _Shinsen-Shōjiroku_ (_Kurita-Hiroshi_, The _Shinsen-Shōjiroku-Kōshō_, Japanese edition, vol. II, pp. 734, 735, 1068 and vol. I, pp. 317, 318, 319).

Some commentators surmise that “Byakuchi” might have been mistaken for “Byakuhō,” while others say that “Byakuhō” p. 81 is correct as it stands, because it is mentioned in the _Taishokukan-Kamatari-Den_ or Biography of _Fujiwara-no-Kamatari_, where the author says that the 5th year of Byakuhō falls in the 5th year of Byakuchi in the Emperor Kōtoku’s reign. _Vide_ the _Gunsho-Ruijū_, or _A Collection of Miscellaneous Works_ (Japanese edition, vol. LXIV). Dr. H. Hoshino (and perhaps others), one of the present collaborators, advances the opinion that the expression Byakuhō or White Phœnix is simply the idealized expression of Byakuchi or White Pheasant, so that possibly “Byakuhō” and “Byakuchi” are identical, even though it is true that this has been a subject of some controversy among Japanese scholars, for, as is seen in the Emperor Shōmu’s Edict of A.D. 724 (the 1st year of Shinki), it is next to impossible to determine which is the exact date of the so-called Byakuhō and Sujaku Eras (The _Shoku-Nihonki_, vol.

Moreover, the same book says that Imbe-no-Muraji-Kōbe (or Kobito) was among those who compiled a history of Japan, which was begun in the year A.D. 681, in the Emperor Temmu’s reign. The _Nihongi_ also mentions the same fact (_Vide_ Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. II, p. 350). And Sakashi was the grandfather of Imbe-no-Muraji-Kōbe.

Kaisui or Kai-Shi-Sui (Chieh-Tzu-Tui) was a retainer of p. 84 Bunkō (Wen-Kung +628 B.C.), otherwise known as Chōji (Chung-Erh), who later on became Feudal Lord of Shin (Chin) in China. Because Kenkō (Hsien-Kung +651 B.C.), father of Bunkō, under the evil influence of his favorite concubine Riki (Li-Chi), killed his eldest son Shinsei (Shen-Sheng), his heir apparent, Chōji, his second son, ran away to foreign lands. During his wanderings in various countries, Chōji had a most faithful companion, named Kai-Shi-Sui. When the fugitive heir, impoverished and forlorn, was overtaken by hunger and fatigue, this loyal retainer Kai-Shi-Sui was willing to serve him, with flesh torn off his own thighs. Some five years after Kenkō’s death, Chōji returned to his native country and restored peace and order there, after which he became Lord of Shin, when his retainers who accompanied him during his wanderings, were all duly rewarded, except Kai-Shi-Sui.

Kai-Shi-Sui, greatly incensed by the injustice of his master Chōji’s unfair rewards, retired to the Menjō mountain (Meen-Shang-Shan) as a recluse, and abandoned the world. Then the repentant Chōji never failed to send his servants to the mountain to seek for Kai-Shi-Sui, but in vain, for, sad to say, Kai-Shi-Sui had been burnt to death, since in their eagerness to find him, some thoughtless persons set fire to the forest of the mountain, hoping thus to force Kai-Shi-Sui to quit it in response to his former master’s invitation. _Vide_ the _Shiki_ (Shih-Chi).

[119](../Part_2#fr_119) 119. Some commentators, both Japanese and foreign, as, for example, Watanabe-no-Ikarimaro and Prof. K. A. Florenz, understand by the Chinese characters 聖皇 the Emperor Shun (舜, Shun) of Ancient China. They see therefore in the passage ### a description of the religious ceremonies performed by him when he ascended the Throne in succession to the famous Emperor Gyō (堯, Yao). They base their opinion simply on the ground of the passage being identical with that in the Chinese classical book _Shokyō_ or _Shu-Ching_ (書經) \[_Shun-Ten_ or _Shun-Tien_ (蕣典)\]. In our opinion, however, Imbe-no-Hironari, the Japanese scholar, made use of the passage cited above merely, because of its rhetorical value in describing a similar event at the Enthronement Ceremony of his own Emperor. The present translators are inclined to support this latter view agreeing with some native commentators (Kubo, The _Kogoshūi-Kōgi_, Japanese edition, p. 115. Prof. K. A. Florenz, _Die Historischen Quellen der Shintō Religion_, S. 447. Tatsuno-Hirochika, The _Kogoshūi-Genyoshū_, Japanese edition, vol. III, p. 8).

[130](../Part_2#fr_130) 130. Apparently the Government Authorities did not accept Imbe-no-Hironari’s protest, for nearly the same expression as “Nakatomi with Imbe under him” is retained in the _Engishiki_ or _Institutes of the Engi Period_ (_Vide_ the _Engishiki_, vol.

Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto of the Nakatomi family and Futotama-no-Mikoto of the Imbe family were in the Heavenly Grandson’s escort, when he descended from the Plain of High Heaven, and Ame-no-Taneko-no-Mikoto of the Nakatomi family and Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto of the Imbe family were actually in p. 87 the Emperor Jimmu’s suite on his journey from Kyūshū to Yamato.

[133](../Part_2#fr_133) 133. This princess was the Emperor Kammu’s daughter and her appointment as Guardian Priestess of the Ise Shrine was made in the 1st year of Enryaku (A.D. 782). She was entrusted with the same sacred office as her distinguished Imperial predecessors, Toyosukiiri-Hime-no-Mikoto and Yamato-Hime-no-Mikoto, had held some centuries before.

The _Ryō-no-Shūge_ states that in the 5th year of Shinki (A.D. 728), by Imperial Command, the Seventh Court Rank was conferred on the hierarch Nakatomi, the offical priest attached to serve the Imperial Guardian Priestess at Ise, whilst Imbe in the same Bureau received the Eighth Court Rank, notwithstanding that this was contrary to the ancient customs and usages. At any rate one thing is certain, _viz._, that Nakatomi’s seniority to Imbe by one grade in Court Rank was not first inaugurated in the Enryaku Era of the Emperor Kammu, when his Imperial daughter was appointed to the Ise Shrine, as Imbe-no-Hironari erroneously states here in the text.

Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto was a mirth-provoking figure of an inspired prophetess who danced before the Heavenly Rock-Cave, p. 88 when myriads of gods anxiously desired to induce the Sun-Goddess to emerge from it; and from that time her descendants Sarume-no-Kimi played an important part as inspired court diviners in the Chinkonsai or Spirit-quieting Ceremony for the Emperor’s Sake (_Vide_ the _Sendai-Kuji-Hongi_, vol. V, the _Tenson-Hongi_ and the _Tennō-Hongi_. The _Kokushi-Taikei_, Japanese edition, vol. VII, pp. 264, 322).

[142](../Part_2#fr_142) 142. The meaning of the words “katakannagi” and “hijikannagi” is not very clear. Some conjecture that they represent two kinds of diviners (whether male or female is uncertain), one is literally “shoulder-diviner,” and the other “elbow-diviner;” the one being an augur who obtains an omen by means of a bird called “shitodo” (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. II, p. 345, note 3) or a Japanese meadow bunting (_emberiza ciopsis_), the other, a diviner by means of rice-grains and a domestic cooking-furnace ring. Some commentators surmise that “katakannagi” is a diviner who takes charge of the divination for an ordinary dry field, while “hijikannagi” is a diviner for a wet rice-field, so entrusted with the work of divination for it (_Cf._ Ban-Nobutomo, The _Seibokukō_ or _Enquiries into Genuine Divination_. The _Ban-Nobutomo-Zenshū_ or _Collected Works_, Japanese edition, vol. II, pp. 533-536. Hirata-Atsutane, the _Koshiden_ or _Exposition of the Ancient Histories_, Japanese edition, vol. XIX, pp. 26-29).

And, moreover, in ancient Japan, the domestic cooking furnace p. 90 was regarded as a god and enjoyed an offical worship. _Vide_ the _Engishiki_. The _Kokushi-Taikei_, Japanese edition, vol. XIII, p. 135.

W. G. Aston left the two difficult words “hijikannagi” and “katakannagi” untouched in his book on Shintō (_Vide_ W. G. Aston _Shintō_, or _the Way of the Gods_, p. 196).

Matsushita-Kenrin seems to understand by the _Kogoshūi_ passage in question a kind of divination practised by means of the bones of the “shitodo” bird, the Japanese meadow bunting. _Vide_ the _Isho-Nihonden or Exposition of the Foreign Notices of Japan_. (Japanese edition, vol. I, 1, p. 11).

<a id="note_143"></a>

[143](../Part_2#fr_143) 143. Anciently a white wild boar, but in later times a white pig, when white wild boars became unobtainable. A somewhat parallel passage is extant in the Mahāyāna Buddhist Sūtra _Bussetsu-Jokyō-Saigen-Kyō_ or the _Sūtra on Removing Fear, Misfortune, and Anxiety_ (Skt. _Śrīkaṇṭha Sūtra_. Nanjiō’s _Catalogue_, No. 398).

The Sūtra says that when the Buddha Śākyamuni was staying in the Veṇuvanavihāra at Rājagṛha a terribly virulent epidemic disease was raging in Vaiśāh, of which countless people there died daily. The Government Authorities were at a loss how to act. A Brahman priest proposed to propitiate the angry gods, or demons, by erecting an altar in their honour. Another Brahman priest advised that a great temple be erected at the cross-roads in the capital to propitiate these gods, or demons. A third advised a still more efficacious remedy, _viz._, to worship the gods or demons by offering several hundreds of white-coloured animals p. 91 —horses, camels, cows, sheep, cocks, and dogs.

A very similar case is mentioned in a history of China, entitled “Sui-Shu” (隋書), published by command of the Chinese Government under the supervision of Wei-Chêng (魏徵) in A.D. 636. Some old religious customs of Chên-La (真臘), the modern Cambodia, are described as follows:—

“During the 5th and 6th months every year, when the climate is very unhealthy, the people offer white wild boars, white oxen, and white sheep in sacrifice outside the western gate of the citadel, believing that if they did not do so the harvest of ‘five cereals’ would be bad, their ‘six domestic animals’ die, and the people suffer from pestilence” (The _Sui-Shu_, Chinese edition, vol. LXXXII, _vide_ the _Chên-La_).

[149](../Part_2#fr_149) 149. We find the myth of Pan-Ku in a certain Chinese book, entitled _Teiō-Goun-Rekinenki_ (_Ti-Wang-Wu-Yun-Li-Nien-Chi_). _Cf._ Nimbō, The _Jutsu-I-Ki_ (Jen-Fang, The Shu-I-Chi).

We venture to use Aston’s quotation from Mayer’s _Chinese Manual_ (p. 174), which says, “Pan-Ku came into being in the Great Waste. His origin is unknown. When dying, he gave birth to the existing material universe. His breath was transmuted p. 92 into the wind and clouds; his voice into thunder; his left eye into the sun, his right eye into the moon; his four limbs and five extremities into the four quarters of the globe and the five great mountains, his blood into the rivers; his muscles and veins into the strata of the earth, his flesh into the soil, etc.” (W. G. Aston, _E.T.N._, vol. I, p. 28). A similar idea is also found in the _Ṛg Veda_ (x, 9) which, like the Chinese myth of Pan-Ku, says that the moon came from the God Brahmā’s mind, the sun from his eye, the great Gods, Indra and Agni, from his mouth; whilst the Wind-God Vāyū came from his breath, and the earth and sky were formed from his feet and head.

Another Buddhist Sūtra similarly described the Brahmanistic God Maheśvara:

“The God Maheśvara,—the ethereal heaven is his head, the earth is his body, the water is his urine, the mountains are his excrements, all the living beings are worms in his belly, the wind is his vital breath, the air his bodily heat, both good and evil are the Karma or constituents of his character” (The _Gedō-Shōjō-Nehan-Ron_. Nanjiō’s _Catalogue_, No. 1260).

[154](../Part_2#fr_154) 154. In certain editions we find the dates differently mentioned, e.g., “the 12th month in the 3rd year of Daidō” or “the 2nd month in the 3rd year of Daidō,” or “the 12th month in the 2nd year of Daidō,” instead of “the 2nd month in the 2nd year of Daidō,” an attempt to synchronize with the date when Imbe-no-Hironari had already been promoted to the Lower Grade of the Junior Fifth Court Rank (he was actually promoted to the Lower Grade of that rank on the 17th day of the 11th month in the 3rd year of Daidō), as mentioned at the beginning of the popular edition of the _Kogoshūi_, which enjoys a large circulation.

This is no doubt an addition by some scribe at a later date than the time the original manuscript was written by Imbe-no-Hironari himself. In the Hōryūji or Ryakunin manuscript we find no date mentioned at all at the end of it. And one of the Maeda manuscripts mentions that there is a sort of manuscript with no such date at all.
