## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXXVIII.

1\. The thirty-eighth subject is this, that, so far as effort and endeavour prevail [^1], it is requisite to abstain from the same cup as those of a different religion, and it is not desirable to drink the water of any goblet of theirs. 2. And if the goblet be of copper or of tin [^2], it is requisite [^3] to wash _it_ with [^4] water, so that it _may_ be proper to drink the water [^5]. 3. If the goblet be of earthenware _or_ wooden, it is altogether improper [^6].

4\. Because, when [^7] any one drinks with a stranger, it makes _his_ heart inclined (maîl) towards him, for it would be a sin; and, on account of the sin committed, he becomes bold, and _his_ soul has an inclination for wickedness.
