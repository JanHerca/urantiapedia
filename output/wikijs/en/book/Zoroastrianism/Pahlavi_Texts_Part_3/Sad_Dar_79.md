## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXXIX.

1\. The seventy-ninth subject is this, that it is necessary to make an effort that they _may_ exercise munificence and liberality towards the good and the worthy. 2. For the exercise of liberality is grand, _in_ such manner as it is better and pleasanter, _in_ like manner, for the ground on which a liberal man walks, better for the wind that blows upon a liberal man, better for the horse on which a liberal man sits, better, _in_ like manner, for the cow and goat that [^1] a liberal man eats, _and_ [^2] pleasanter for the sun and moon and stars that shine upon a liberal man.

3\. To such an extent is a liberal and munificent _man_ precious (’hazîz), that Hôrmazd speaks [^3] thus: ‘I have wished that I _might_ give a recompense _to_ a munificent man, if it be suitable for him, _but_ I have not found any recompense and happiness that are suitable for him, except a blessing.’ 4. And virtuous men and the united archangels are perpetually uttering blessings on account of the liberal man who maintains no refusal of his own things to a stranger. <span id="p343"><sup><small>[ p. 343 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. For it is declared in revelation, that the creator Hôrmazd spoke to Zaratu<i>s</i>t, the Spitamân, thus: ‘I have created the supreme heaven of heavens for the sake of any of the liberal who provide for the worthy and give them something; and gloomy hell is for all those persons who give anything to the unworthy.’

6\. _In_ like manner it is declared in revelation, that there are thirty-three ways to heaven, besides _that of_ the souls of the liberal. 7. If the soul be of any one else, it is not able to arrive in heaven [^4] by that way. 8. Besides _this_ happy [^5] way, a soul of the liberal is able to arrive in heaven by means of the thirty-three ways. 9. For no one is it easier to arrive in heaven than _for_ the liberal.
