## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XLV.

1\. The forty-fifth subject is this, that it is continually necessary that _people should_ keep in remembrance the accomplishment of repentance (taûbat). 2. Every time that a sin leaps from control it is necessary to act so that they go before the priests, high-priests, and _spiritual_ chiefs, and accomplish repentance.

3\. And [^1] in accordance with the sin _should be_ the good work, just as though the good work _were_ due to that occasion when they accomplish _it_. 4. While mankind are living, it becomes every year a further benefit. 5. Sin is also, _in_ like manner, going _on_ to a head every year; and when they accomplish repentance, so that it _may_ not increase further, it is just like a tree that becomes withered, and they extirpate its further growth.

6\. And that repentance is better which they accomplish before high-priests and _spiritual_ chiefs, and when they accomplish the retribution that the high-priest orders every sin that exists departs from them. 7. The repentance _that_ high-priests accomplish they likewise call repentance [^2]. 8. If _there_ be no high-priest it is necessary to go before some persons who are commissioned _by_ high-priests; and if those, also, do not exist, it is necessary to go to a man _who is_ a friend of the soul, _and_ to accomplish the repentance. <span id="p309"><sup><small>[ p. 309 ]</small></sup></span> 9\. At the time when _one_ shall depart from the world it is incumbent on sons and daughters and relations, that they give repentance into the mouth of the afflicted _one, and that_ they give the Ashem-vohû [^3] into _his_ mouth. 10. For the high-priests have said that, when they have accomplished repentance because they have committed many sins, they do not arrive in hell, _but_ they administer punishment _to them_ at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, and afterwards conduct _them_ to their own place.

11\. Repentance is that when they accomplish repentance of the sin which they have committed, and do not commit that sin a second _time;_ if they do commit _it_, that _first sin_ then comes back [^4].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (308:1) Lp, B29 have ‘for.’

[^2]: (308:2) Here and throughout the rest of the chapter B29 has patit, ‘renunciation _of sin_,’ instead of taûbat. The outward form of repentance consists of the recitation of the patit, in which all imaginable sins are mentioned and renounced.

[^3]: (309:1) See Chap. VII, 1 n.

[^4]: (309:2) That is, repentance is not a mere penance, but requires a change of will, a veritable renunciation of that sin for the future; otherwise it is useless.
