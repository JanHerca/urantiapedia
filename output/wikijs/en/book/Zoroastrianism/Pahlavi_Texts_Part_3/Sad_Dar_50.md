## SAD DAR. CHAPTER L [^1].

1\. The fiftieth subject is this, that, every day _at_ dawn, when they rise up from sleep, it is not proper to wash the hands first with water.

2\. The _ceremonial_ ablution is to wash the hands, face, nose, eyes, and feet thoroughly, either with fruit (mîvah) [^2] or some grass upon which no water has come; afterwards, to make _them_ dry, _and_ to wash _them_ three times with water _in_ such a manner that it becomes wet from the face as far as the ear [^3]. 3. It is necessary to keep the mouth closed, so that the water _shall_ not go into the mouth; for if a drop, owing to not stopping, goes into the mouth, it is a sin of three hundred stîrs [^4]. 4. Afterwards, _one is_ to wash the hands three times with water, as far as the _upper_ arms; first the right hand, _and_ afterwards the left hand; and, _in_ like manner, _he is_ to wash the right foot and left foot. <span id="p313"><sup><small>[ p. 313 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. Then they recite the K<i>e</i>m-nâ-mazdâ [^5], for, every time that they wish to recite anything as an _inward_ prayer, it is necessary that the hands be washed with _ceremonial_ ablution [^6], and, if _they are_ not, the Avesta is not accepted, and the fiend of corruption (nasu<i>s</i>) does not rush _away, and_ it becomes a Tanâvar sin.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (312:1) Omitted in La, Lp, though the former contains a portion of this chapter annexed to part of Chap. XLVIII, and most of its contents are repeated, in other words, in Chap. LXXIV.

[^2]: (312:2) Perhaps mîvah may be taken as an adjective from mîv, ‘hair;’ in which case we should have ‘with _something_ either hairy or grassy.’ According to the long-metre Sad Dar, the liquid to be used for this first wetting is either goat's or bull's urine.

[^3]: (312:3) La has ‘from ear to ear’ (sec Chap. XLVIII, 1 n).

[^4]: (312:4) A Tanâvar or Tanâpûhar sin (see Sls. I, 2).

[^5]: (313:1) See Chap. XXXV, 2 n, which chapter, as well as Chap. LXXIV, treats of nearly the same subject.

[^6]: (313:2) As described in § 2-4.
