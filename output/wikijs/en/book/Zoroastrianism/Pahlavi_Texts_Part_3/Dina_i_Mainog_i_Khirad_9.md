## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER IX.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘Is it possible to go from region to region [^1],or not? <span id="p36"><sup><small>[ p. 36 ]</small></sup></span> 3. From what substance is the sky made? 4. And how and in what manner is the mingling of the water in the earth?’

5\. The spirit of wisdom answered (6) thus: 'Without the permission of the sacred beings, or the permission of the demons, it is then [^2] not possible for one to go from region to region [^3].

7\. 'The sky is made from the substance of the blood-stone [^4], such as they also call diamond (almâst).

8\. ‘And the mingling of the water in the earth is just like the blood in the body of man.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (35:6) The earth is supposed to be divided into seven regions, of which the central one is as large as the other six united; two of p. 36 the six lie to the north, two to the south, one to the east, and one to the west; and they are said to be separated by seas or mountains, difficult to cross (see Bd. XI). For their names, see Chaps. XVI, 10, XXVII, 40.

[^2]: (36:1) Instead of adîna<i>s</i>, ‘then for one,’ Nêr. has manufactured a word ainâ, ‘otherwise’ (see also Chap. VII, 19 n).

[^3]: (36:2) This information is derived from Pahl. Vend. I, 4 <i>a</i>.

[^4]: (36:3) Or ‘ruby,’ referring to the rosy tints of dawn and sunset. The same statement is made in Bd. XII, 6. Nêr. has ‘steel,’ and the word can be translated ‘blood-metal.’
