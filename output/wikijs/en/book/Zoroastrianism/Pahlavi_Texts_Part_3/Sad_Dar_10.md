## SAD DAR. CHAPTER X.

I. The tenth subject is this, that it is incumbent on all those of the good religion, women and men, every one who attains to fifteen years, to wear the _sacred thread-_girdle [^4]. 2. Because the _sacred thread-_girdle is to be a girding of the loins and to preserve obedience (<i>t</i>â’hat) to the Lord, may he be honoured and glorified (’hazza va <i>g</i>alla)!

3\. The first person who set the wearing of this _sacred thread-_girdle in view was Jamshê<i>d</i> [^5]. 4. And it may be the whole (<i>g</i>umlah) of the demons and fiends who are made extinct by the glory of wearing the _sacred thread-_girdle.

5\. Every one who _has_ tied the _sacred thread-_girdle round the waist is out of the department of Aharman, and is established in the department of <span id="p269"><sup><small>[ p. 269 ]</small></sup></span> Hôrmazd. 6. And also, while he keeps the _sacred thread-_girdle on the waist, _there_ is a share _for_ him of all those duties and good works which they perform in the earth of seven regions. 7. It is like that _which occurs_ when they are performing hamâ zôr and hamâ ashô [^1], and have put _on_ this _sacred thread-_girdle on that account, _or_ when, similarly, some one in Ka<i>s</i>mîr, or <i>E</i>rân-ve<i>g</i>, or Kangdez, or the enclosure formed by Jam [^2], performs a good work, _and_ we are not able to perform _it_ with hamâ zôr, then they and we, _who_ wear the _sacred thread-_girdle on the waist, are mutually connected and equally meritorious, one _with_ the other. 8. As no good work attains to him _who_ does not wear a _sacred thread-_girdle—excepting that which he performs himself—it is therefore necessary that any one of mankind _should_ not put _it_ [^3] away from the waist on any occasion, so that the associated good works of those of the good religion _may_ attain to him.

9\. And those four knots [^4], _with_ which they tie _it_ on, are on this account, that it _may_ give four attestations. <span id="p270"><sup><small>[ p. 270 ]</small></sup></span> 10. The first knot is that which preserves [^1] constancy (qarâr), and gives attestation as to the existence, unity, purity, and matchlessness of the sacred being, the good _and_ propitious. 11. The second knot is that which gives attestation _that it is_ the good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers which is the word of the sacred being. 12. The third knot is that which gives attestation as to the apostleship and mission (rasûlî) in the just (‘haqq) Zaratu<i>s</i>t, the Spitamân. 13. The fourth knot is that which adduces more pleasantly, gives assurance (iqrâr), and openly accepts that I _should_ think of good, speak of good, and do good. 14. And from the whole I become established; and the pure, good [^2] religion is this, that I persist in those _views_.

15\. And, again, when the archangels came meeting Zaratu<i>s</i>t they likewise wore the _sacred thread-_girdle on the waist; and the distinctive _characteristic_ (farq) amid the laws of the sacred being is the wearing of the _sacred thread-_girdle. 16. It is incumbent both on woman and on man, _and_ it is altogether (albattah) improper when they do not wear _it_.

## Footnotes

[^4]: (268:4) See Dd. XXXIX, 1 n. A modification of the age is recommended in Chap. XLVI.

[^5]: (268:5) Av. Yima khshaêta (see Mkh. XXVII, 24 n).

[^1]: (269:1) These words form part of a benedictory formula which concludes certain ceremonies (see Haug's Essays, pp. 407, 409), and the recital of them implies that the ceremony, which is a good work, has been fully and satisfactorily completed. If this good work be in excess of what is wanted to balance its performer's sins, it can be imputed to any other member of the good religion who may be in want of it, provided he wears the girdle. The MSS. have hamâ for hamâ.

[^2]: (269:2) These four localities are considered to be isolated from the seven regions to some extent (see Bd. XXIX, 4), probably implying that they were supposed to contain Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers independent of Iranian rule, or that their position had become unknown. (See also Mkh. XXVII, 27-31, 58, 62, XLIV, 17-35, LXII, 13-19.)

[^3]: (269:3) Lp, B29 have ‘that mankind _should_ not put the girdle.’

[^4]: (269:4) That is, two double knots, one before and the other behind (see SBE, vol. xviii, pp. 386, 387).

[^1]: (270:1) Altered into ‘brings’ by a later hand in La, and so written in Lp, B29.

[^2]: (270:2) Lp, B29 omit ‘good.’
