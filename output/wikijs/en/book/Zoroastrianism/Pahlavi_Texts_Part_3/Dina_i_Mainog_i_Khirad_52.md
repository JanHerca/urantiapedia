## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER LII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘How is it necessary to perform the ceremonial of the sacred beings and the thanksgiving for the welfare which is owing to the sacred beings? 3. _And_ how is the renunciation _of sin_ to be performed for the preservation of the soul?’

4\. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'That ceremonial of the sacred beings is good which they perform in this pure, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers. 6. Its origin, also, is goodness and truth, and freedom from doubt in the sacred beings. 7. And for the little and the much that has come _there has_ arisen thanksgiving unto the sacred beings; and _one_ is to meditate upon the gratifications (shnûmakân) and prosperity which are owing to the, sacred beings and to keep grateful [^2]. 8. And even when perplexity and misery come on from Aharman and the demons, _he_ is not to become doubtful as to the treasure of the sacred beings, (9) and not to diminish the thanksgiving unto the sacred beings. 10. And every disaster which springs up _he_ is to give back [^3] to the violence of Aharman and the demons. 11. _He_ is not to seek his own welfare and advantage through the injury of any one else; (12) and he <span id="p95"><sup><small>[ p. 95 ]</small></sup></span> becomes compassionate as regards the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 13. In duty and good works _he_ is diligent and striving [^1]; (14) _and_ especially in the care of water and fire [^2] _he_ is to persevere much. 15. And _he_ is to be without doubt as to this, that, except happiness, the sacred beings do not then [^3] give anything whatever, _as_ a modification [^4] of it, unto men; and Aharman and the demons, except misery, do not then [^3] give them any happiness.

16\. ‘For the existence of renunciation _of sin_ the special thing is this, that _one_ commits no sin voluntarily; (17) and if, through folly, or weakness and ignorance, a sin occurs, he is then in renunciation _of sin_ before the high-priests and the good. 18. And after that, _when_ [^5] he does not commit it, then that sin which is committed by him becomes thus a sweeping (êsvârakŏ) [^6] from his body; (19) just as the wind which is hasty and mighty, when it comes swift and strong, sweeps so over the plain that it carries away every single blade of grass (gîyyâkî<i>k</i>akŏ-1) and anything which is broken _in_ that place.’
