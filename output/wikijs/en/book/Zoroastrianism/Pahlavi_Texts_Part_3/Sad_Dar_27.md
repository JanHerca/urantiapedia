## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. The twenty-seventh subject is this, that is, if any affair comes forward, that they _should_ thoroughly understand [^1] whether it be a good work, or a sin. 2. In that manner it becomes better that they make an evasion on the spot [^2], until a time _when_ they make _it_ known with accuracy [^3] that that affair is a sin or a reward. 3. If they perform any affair without knowing _this_, although it be a good work, it becomes a sin for them.

4\. For it is declared in revelation, that, except that which they enquire of the high-priests, no affair whatever is proper to perform. 5. Whatever wisdom _there be_ for any one from his own head is only one; then, _as_ two wisdoms are more than one [^4], it therefore makes _it_ expedient to enquire of the high-priests.
