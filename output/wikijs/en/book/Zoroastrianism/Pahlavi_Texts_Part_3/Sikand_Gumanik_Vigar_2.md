## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER II.

1\. The first subject (2) is about several questions _that_ the ever-successful Mit<i>r</i>ô-aîyyâr [^1], son of Mahmâ<i>d</i>, <span id="p123"><sup><small>[ p. 123 ]</small></sup></span> from Spâhân [^2], asked with good intent _and_ not in search of defects, _and_ the answer _thereto_.

3\. _As to_ that which is asked thus: ‘Why did Aharman hurry on to the light [^3], and how was it possible to be _so_ when _he_ is not _of_ a like nature with it, though we always see that whatever is not _of_ a like nature abstains from a different nature as much as water _does_ from fire?’ 4. The answer is this, that the cause itself of the hurrying on of Aharman, which _was_ to the light, _was his_ different nature. 5. And on account of the desire of a destroyer, which was perpetually in his nature, _he_ is a destroyer of different natures.

6\. Being injured _and_ injuring, however they occur, do not take place except from difference of nature and those of a different nature. 7. Because _in_ those of a like nature _there_ exist similarity of will and unanimity, one towards the other, not injuring _and_ being injured. 8. And those of a different nature, on account of _their_ opposing nature, are destroyers _and_ injurers, one of the other, however they come together. 9. Those of a like nature, on account of unanimity and similarity of nature, are lively [^4], efficient, and mutually helping, when they come together.

10\. The disintegration and separation of like natures is the disunion of different natures. 11. Just <span id="p124"><sup><small>[ p. 124 ]</small></sup></span> as heat _and_ cold which, on account of _their_ opposing nature, are destroyers and injurers, resisting _and_ disintegrating one another, through _their_ perpetual nature. 12. Because every disintegration is owing to the laws (rastagân) of cold and dryness, heat and moisture, (13) and _their_ destruction, injuring, _and_ opposition of one another. 14. For the disintegration of bodies is owing to the perpetual struggling of heat and cold, dryness and moisture; (15) _and_ owing to their struggling, one with the other, bodies are disintegrated _and_ disabled.

16\. Of water and fire, through their own nature, no injury whatever is manifest; (17) but the cold of _their_ fraternization [^5] is mingled with the moisture of the water, _and_ is an opponent of the heat of the fire; (18) and the dryness of _their_ fraternization is mingled with the heat of the fire, _and_ is counteractingly an injurer of the moisture _of_ the water.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (122:1) This person, who is not mentioned elsewhere, was probably a layman and evidently a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper, although his father's name seems to be Muhammadan, either Ma‘hmûd or Mu‘hammad. The Parsis under a Muhammadan government often adopted Muhammadan names, as they also took Hindu names in India; but, in this case, it is perhaps more probable that the father had become p. 123 a convert to Muhammadanism, and changed his name accordingly, after his son had grown up.

[^2]: (123:1) The Pahlavi form of Ispahân.

[^3]: (123:2) In Bd. I, 9, 10 we are told that when the evil spirit arose from the abyss, he rushed in to destroy the light which he then saw for the first time, but was frightened away by its bravery and glory.

[^4]: (123:3) So understand by Nêr., but zîvihend may mean ‘they are graceful,’ or it may be a misreading of zênîhend, ‘they are armed.’

[^5]: (124:1) When water comes in contact with fire.
