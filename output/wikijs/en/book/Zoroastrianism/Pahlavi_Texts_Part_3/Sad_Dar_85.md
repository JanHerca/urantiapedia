## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXXXV.

1\. The eighty-fifth subject is this, that, _in_ every matter that comes forward, it is necessary to enquire of the wise and relations, so as to have their advice, and not to transact any business according to one's own idea _and_ opinion.

2\. For it is declared in revelation, that the sacred being, the good _and_ propitious, spoke to Zaratu<i>s</i>t thus: ‘_As to_ every business that thou wishest to transact, do thou receive wisdom and knowledge at one place with the wise _who_ reply, and cast away _what is_ unconsidered, so that Aharman _may_ not reach _it_ midway, and injury (‘<i>h</i>alal) _may_ not occur to that business.’ <span id="p350"><sup><small>[ p. 350 ]</small></sup></span> 3\. _In_ like manner the archangel Spendârma<i>d</i> [^1], _at_ the time when _her_ gaze passed on to Minô<i>k</i>ihar [^2], issued to him this admonition _and_ precept (vaʓîyat), _and_ said: ‘O Minô<i>k</i>ihar! although _there_ be deliberation _in_ an affair, this may be no reason for it as regards the spirits [^3]; although a horse may be good, _there_ may be no resource _except_ a whip for it; and although _one_ may be a wise man, _there_ should be no retreat on his part from having advice, so that his business _may_ become complete.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (350:1) See Chap. XXXIII, 2 n.

[^2]: (350:2) Pahl. Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (see Mkh. XXVII, 41 n). It appears from Sls. X, 28, where a portion of this tale is quoted, that it comes originally from the <i>K</i>î<i>d</i>ra<i>s</i>t Nask.

[^3]: (350:3) B29 has ‘although a knife be sharp, _there_ may be no resource except a whetstone for it,’ which follows the next clause in Sls. X, 28. In the original text this change of meaning is produced by a difference in only four words, and the author of the Sad Dar has probably misunderstood the Pahlavi original when translating it.
