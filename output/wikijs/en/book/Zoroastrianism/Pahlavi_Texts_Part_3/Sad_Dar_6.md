## SAD DAR. CHAPTER VI.

1\. The sixth subject is this, that of the many good works there are those which, when they accomplish _them_, obtain great (’ha_th_îm) rewards; _and_ if _one_ does not perform _them_ severe punishment seizes upon _one_ at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge [^1]. 2. One is _the celebration of_ the season festivals [^2]; the second is keeping _the days of_ the guardian spirits [^3]; the third is _attending to_ the souls of fathers, mothers, _and_ other relations [^4]; the fourth is _reciting_ the Khûrshê<i>d</i> Nyâyi<i>s</i> [^5] three times every day; the fifth is _reciting_ the Mâh Nyâyi<i>s</i> [^6] three times every month, once when it becomes new, once when it becomes full, and once when it becomes slender [^7]; _and_ the sixth is celebrating the Rapithwin [^8] _ceremony_ once every year. 3. If not able to celebrate _them_ oneself, it is requisite to order _them_, so that they _may_ celebrate them every single time [^9].

4\. These six good works are things indispensable unto every one. 5. When any one _of them_ is not _performed_—be it that which, if omitted at its own time [^10], it is not possible to accomplish, or if it be that one time _one_ omits an occasion, _and_ another time [^11] they accomplish twice as much—_one should_ consider [^12] that as an advantage, _which_ occurs in retribution <span id="p265"><sup><small>[ p. 265 ]</small></sup></span> for it, or _as_ atonement for the transgression. 6. Because they call the transgression of each of these six a bridge-sin; that is, every one _through_ whom a transgression of these may have arisen they keep back, at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, till punishment for it happens to him, and no good work is possible [^1] in this place, which is torment and punishment for him [^2].

7\. Therefore it is necessary to make an effort, that they _may_ be performed each one at its own time, so that they _may_ obtain a recompense, _and_ not a severe punishment.
