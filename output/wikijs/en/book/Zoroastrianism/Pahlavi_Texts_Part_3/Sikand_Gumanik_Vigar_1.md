<i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR

## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER I.

1\. _In_ the name of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the lord, the greatest and wise, \[the all-ruling, all-knowing, and almighty, (2) who is a spirit even among spirits, (3) and from his self-existence, single in unity, _was_ the creation of the faithful. 4. He also created, by his own unrivalled power, the seven supreme archangels [^1],\] all the angels of the spiritual _and_ worldly _existences_, (5) and the seven worldly characteristics [^2] which are man, animals, fire, metal, earth, water, _and_ plants.

6\. And man _was_ created by him, as a control of the creatures, for the advancement of _his_ will. 7. From him likewise came [^3] _at_ various times, through <span id="p118"><sup><small>[ p. 118 ]</small></sup></span> his own compassion, mercifulness to his own creatures, religion, and a natural desire of the knowledge of purity _and_ contamination. 8. So, also, _as to_ the intellect, understanding, wisdom, knowledge, consciousness, _and_ guardian spirit—which are the appliances of the soul that are seeking information of these spiritual appliances, the five which are the sight, hearing, smell, taste, _and_ touch, (9) through the five worldly appliances, which are the eye, the ear, the nose, the mouth, and the rubbing surfaces of the whole body—(10) he likewise created man with the accompaniment of these appliances, for the management of the creatures.

11\. He also created the religion of omniscience like an immense tree, (12) of which _there_ are one stem, two branches, three boughs, four twigs, _and_ five shoots [^1]. 13. And its one stem is agreement. 14. The two branches are performance and abstinence. 15. The three boughs are Humat, Hûkht, _and_ Huvar<i>s</i>t, which are good thoughts, good words, _and_ good deeds. 16. The four twigs are the four classes of the religion, by whom the religion _and_ world are prepared, (17) which are priesthood, warriorship, husbandry, _and_ artisanship. 18. The five shoots are the five rulers whose scriptural names are the house-ruler, the village-ruler, the tribe-ruler, the province-ruler, _and_ the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 19. And the one chief of chiefs, who is the king of kings, is the ruler of the world.

20\. Likewise, the work manifested by him in the world—which is man—is in the likeness of these four <span id="p119"><sup><small>[ p. 119 ]</small></sup></span> classes of the world. 21. As unto [^1] the head is priesthood, (22) unto the hand is warriorship, (23) unto the belly is husbandry, (24) _and_ unto the foot is artisanship.

25\. So, also, of the four capabilities (hunarân) that are in man—which are temper, ability, wisdom, _and_ diligence—(26) unto temper (khîm) is priesthood, as the greatest duty of priests is the temper that they do not commit sin on account of shame and fear; (27) unto ability (hunar) is warriorship, that is, the most princely adornment of warriors is the ability which is expended, the manliness which is owing to self-possession (khva<i>d</i>îh); (28) unto husbandmen is the wisdom (khira<i>d</i>) which is strenuous performance of the tillage _of_ the world, _and_ continuance unto the renovation _of the universe;_ (29) _and_ unto artisans is the diligence (tukhshâkîh) which is the greatest advancement of their class.

30\. This arrangement [^2] of every kind is upon one stem, truth and agreement, opposing the fiend and his appliances which are co-existent. 31. These [^3], which are recounted by me, are of many kinds _and_ many species, as many are religious _and_ many believing at a period that all are mutually afflicting [^4], <span id="p120"><sup><small>[ p. 120 ]</small></sup></span> co-existent destroyers _and_ injurers, one as regards the other. 32. _And_ with the mutual afflictiveness, destructiveness, and combativeness which are theirs, one towards the other, they [^1] afterwards also contend against the one truth co-operatively _and_ with united strength.

33\. The possession of truth is the one power of the faithful, through the singleness of truth. 34. The many kinds of falsehood, _which_ must become confused _and_ mutually afflicting to many, are, in the aggregate, from one source of deceitfulness.

35\. _As to_ that, this composition is provided by me, _who_ am Mar<i>d</i>ân-farukh [^2] _son_ of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>\-dâ<i>d</i>, as I saw in the age much religiousness _and_ much good consideration of sects (kêshân) of many species; (36) and I have been fervent-mindedly, _at_ all times in my whole youthful career, an enquirer _and_ investigator of the truth of them. 37. For the same reason I have wandered forth also to many realms and [^3] the seashore. 38. And of these compendious statements which, owing thereto [^4], are an enquiry of those desiring the truth, and [^5] a collection and selection (vi<i>g</i>î<i>d</i>anŏ) of <span id="p121"><sup><small>[ p. 121 ]</small></sup></span> it, for these memoranda, from the writings and memoranda of the ancient sages _and_ high-priests of the just—and especially those of the glorified Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>îyâvand [^1]—the name <i>S</i>ikand-gûmânîk Vi<i>g</i>âr [^2] is appointed by me. 39. As it is very suitable for explaining away the doubts of new learners about the thorough understanding of the truth, the blessedness and truth of the good religion, and the inward dignity of those free from strife.

40\. And it is composed and arranged by me not for the wise and talented, but _for_ preceptors (farhangîkân) [^3] _and_ those newly qualified. 41. So that, while many become freer from doubt about the miraculousness and blessedness of the statements of the good religion and primitive faith, (42) I am still begging of distinguished sages, (43) that whoever wants to look, should not look [^4] to the religion of the particular speaker _and_ composer, but to the greatness of the truth, blessedness, and definite statements of the ancient sages. 44. Because I, who am the composer, do not hold the station of teaching, but that of learning.

45\. And it seemed to me, through liberal thought, a statement, from that knowledge of the religion, destined and important even for new learners. 46. Because _he_ who distributes to the worthy, out of the little knowledge which is his, is more acceptable than _he_ who knows much _and_ the worthy are without benefit _and_ without help from him.

47\. Since those ancient sages decided, (48) that liberality is of three kinds, of thought, of word, _and_ <span id="p122"><sup><small>[ p. 122 ]</small></sup></span> of deed. 49. Liberality of thought _being_ that whose wishing of happiness for any others whatever, of a like disposition, is as much as for its own. 50. Liberality in word _being_ that which teaches to the worthy _something_ out of every virtuous knowledge and information which have come to it; (51) just as that which a _certain_ sage said (52) thus: ‘I desire that I _may_ understand all information which is advantageous, and I _will_ teach _it_ to friends and acquire the result which is obtainable.’ 53. _And_ the liberality which is in deed _being_ that which, out of any benefit whatever that has come to it, is a benefit to the worthy.

54\. Again, _it_ is a reminding of the good as to the preservation of the soul; (55) _and_ for the same reason I _have_ arranged that while the wise are kindly observant of me, through their own compassion, they _may_ remember about the immortality of the soul. 56. Since it is said, that the eye of him who observes all good creatures with kind eyes is the eye of the sun; (57) because the sun is, indeed, an observer and beautifier with kind eyes for all creatures.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (117:1) The passage in brackets is omitted in several Pahl. MSS., many of which commence at this point, but it is found in K28, BM, and others, and also in the Pâz. MSS. and Sans. version. The first epithet, ‘all-ruling,’ which it contains is likewise omitted in a few Pâz. MSS., while others add a further laudatory passage at that point, which is evidently a modern interpolation. The seven archangels include Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> himself (see Bd. I, 26 n).

[^2]: (117:2) So in the Pahl. MSS. and Sans. version, and also in MH 19 and PB3, which latter follows the oldest Pâz. MS. (AK) very closely; but §§ 1-16 have been lost from AK itself. Several other Pâz. MSS. substitute ‘creations.’

[^3]: (117:3) So understood by Nêryôsang, but the original Pahlavi could have been translated by ‘he likewise sent,’ because the Huzvâri<i>s</i> yâtûn<i>d</i>, ‘came,’ and <i>s</i>e<i>d</i><i>r</i>un<i>d</i>, ‘sent,’ are written alike.

[^1]: (118:1) The last two terms were, no doubt, Pahl. <i>s</i>âk and barg-gâh, of which the Pâz. dê<i>s</i>aa and brî<i>s</i>aa are merely misreadings.

[^1]: (119:1) Or ‘over.’ This comparison of these four parts of the body to the four classes of men is mentioned several times in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, especially in the latter part of the fourth book.

[^2]: (119:2) That is, the ordinances of religion (see §§ 11-13).

[^3]: (119:3) The various heterodox religions, here assumed to be appliances of the fiend for misleading mankind, which the author discusses in the course of his arguments hereafter.

[^4]: (119:4) Assuming that Pâz. a<i>n</i>basã stands for Pahl. hanbêshin, as in Mkh. I, 37. It might be hû-bêshin, ‘well-afflicting,’ but this would not be so easily reconciled with the meaning ‘inconsistent’ which the word often assumes, as in Chaps. XIII, 145, 147, XV, 77, XVI, 42.

[^1]: (120:1) The heterodox religions.

[^2]: (120:2) As this name has not been found elsewhere, nothing further is known about the author of this work than can be gathered from the few statements he has made in the work itself. He lived probably in the eighth or ninth century of the Christian era, as he mentions the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> edited by Âtû<i>r</i>\-frôbag in Chaps. IV, 107, V, 92, IX, 1, 4, X, 57, XII, 1, and also the Rôshan commentary prepared by Âtû<i>r</i>\-frôbag's son (see Chaps. X, 53, 54, XI, 213); but he does not allude to the later edition of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, prepared by .Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>, son of Hêmî<i>d</i>, who was living in the latter part of the ninth century (see Bd. XXXIII, ix n).

[^3]: (120:3) Sans. ‘on.’ This statement is very similar to that in Mkh. I, 35.

[^4]: (120:4) Reading a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>, instead of the similarly-written afa<i>s</i>, ‘and of it.’

[^5]: (120:5) Reading afa<i>s</i>, instead of a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i> here.

[^1]: (121:1) See Chap. IV, 106.

[^2]: (121:2) ‘Doubt-dispelling explanation.’

[^3]: (121:3) Sans. has ‘students.’

[^4]: (121:4) Sans. has ‘you should not look.’
