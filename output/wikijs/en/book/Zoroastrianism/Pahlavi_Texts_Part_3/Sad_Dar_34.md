## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXXIV.

1\. The thirty-fourth subject is this, that it is greatly necessary to refrain from much slaughter of animals and the cattle species [^1]. 2. Because it says in revelation [^2] that, _for_ every one who slaughters many animals _and_ cattle [^3], every fibre of the hair of a goat becomes, in that _other_ world, like a sharp sword, _and_ adheres in the soul of that person.

3\. And there are several things the slaughter of which is very bad, and the sin very abundant, _as_ the lamb, the kid, the ploughing ox, the war horse, the swallow bird that catches the locust, and the cock; and of the whole of these the sin is most _as regards_ the cock. 4. If it becomes a necessity [^4], it is proper to kill a cock _that_ does not crow [^5], and it is necessary to consecrate their heads. 5. Any head of an animal, not consecrated, it is not desirable to eat, so that it becomes so far [^6] a righteous gift. 6. If _one_ be not able to consecrate the head, it is requisite to consecrate one kidney _as_ a substitute (badal) for it.
