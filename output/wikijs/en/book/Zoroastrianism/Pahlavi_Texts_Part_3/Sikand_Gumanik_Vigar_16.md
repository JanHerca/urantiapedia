## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER XVI.

1\. Again, about the delusion of Mânî, one out of the thousands _and_ myriads is written; (2) for I am not unrestrained (anatang) as to writing more fully of the delusion, twaddle, and deceit of Mânî and the Mânîchaeans, (3) and much trouble and long-continued daily work is necessary for me therein.

4\. Now you Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers of Zaratû<i>s</i>t should know that the original statement of Mânî _was_ about the unlimitedness of the original evolutions, (5) the intermediate _one_ about _their_ mingling, (6) and the final _one_ about the distinction of light from dark, (7) that which is much more like unto want of distinction [^1].

8\. Again, _he states_ this, that the worldly existence is a bodily formation of rudiments of Aharman; (9) the bodily formation _being_ a production of Aharman. 10. And a repetition of that _statement_ is this, that the sky is from the skin, (11) the earth from the flesh, (12) the mountains from the <span id="p244"><sup><small>[ p. 244 ]</small></sup></span> bones, (13) and the trees from the hair of the demon Kunî [^2]. 14. The rain is the seed of the Mâzendarâns [^3] who are bound on the _celestial_ sphere. 15. Mankind are two-legged demons, and animals four-legged. 16. And Kunî is the commander of the army of Aharman, (17) who, to be liberated by [^4] his nails from the divinity Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _in_ the first conflict, swallowed the light; (18) and, in the second conflict, the demon Kunî _was_ captured by them, _together_ with many demons. 19. And it is _in_ binding the demon Kunî on the _celestial_ sphere _he_ is killed, (20) _and_ these magnificent creatures are preserved from him and formed.

21\. And the sun _and_ moon are arranged in supremacy _in_ the outer sky; (22) so that, as regards that light which the demons swallowed, they filter and excite [^5] _it_, little _by_ little, through the exciting and filtering of the sun and moon. 23. Then Aharman knew, through foresight, that they _would_ rapidly filter and release this light through the exciting of the sun and moon. 24. _And_, for the purpose of not rapidly releasing the light from the darkness, he prepared this lesser world which, like mankind, cattle, _and_ the other living creatures, is a wholly-copied similitude of the greater world <span id="p245"><sup><small>[ p. 245 ]</small></sup></span> with the other bodily creations [^6]. 25. He confined life and light in the body, and made _them_ prisoners; (26) so that, while that light which is excited by the sun and moon is again exhausted through the cohabitation and birth of living creatures, (27) _their_ release would become more tardy.

28\. And the rain was the seed of the Mâzendarâns (29) for the reason _that_ when the Mâzendarâns are bound on the _celestial_ sphere [^7], (30) whose light is swallowed by them, (31) and, in order to pass _it_ from them through a new regulation, discrimination, and retention of the light of Time [^8], the twelve glorious _ones_ [^9] show the daughters of Time _to_ the household-attending male Mâzendarâns, (32) so that while the lust of those Mâzendarâns, from seeing them, is well suited to them, (33) and seed is discharged from them, (34) the light which is within the seed is poured _on_ to the earth. 35. Trees, shrubs, _and_ grain have grown therefrom, (36) and the light which is within the Mâzendarâns is discharged in the seed. 37. That which is within the earth is discharged from the earth as the cause of the trees.

38\. Again, about the difference of nature of life and body, this _is stated_, that the life is confined and imprisoned within the body. 39. _And_ as the producer and maintainer of the bodily formations of all material existences is Aharman, (40) for the same reason it is not expedient to occasion birth _and_ to propagate lineage—(41) because it is co-operating <span id="p246"><sup><small>[ p. 246 ]</small></sup></span> with Aharman in the maintenance of mankind and cattle, and _in_ causing the exhaustion of the life and light within _their_ bodies—nor yet to cultivate trees and grain.

42\. Again, inconsistently, they also say this, (43) that the destroyer of the creatures is always Aharman; (44) _and_, for the same reason, it is not expedient to kill any creature whatever, (45) because it (killing) is the work of Aharman.

46\. Again, _they say_ this, that, as the world is maintained by Aharman, _and in_ the end the sacred being is triumphant (47) through the departure of lives from bodies, (48) this worldly existence is dissipated in the end, (49) _and_ is not arranged anew; (50) nor does _there_ occur a restoration of the dead _and_ a future existence.

51\. Again, _they say_ this, that those two original evolutions are perpetually remaining, _and_ existed as contiguously as sun and shadow, (52) and no demarcation [^10] and open space existed between them.

53\. Now I speak first about the impossibility of the occurrence of any existing thing _that is_ unlimited, (54) except only those which I call unlimited, _that is_, empty space and time. 55. Those, indeed, which are for existence within _them—that is_ beings and things in locality and time—are seen _to be_ limited.

56\. This, too, _I say_, that, if unity and duality be spoken _of_ about them, _it is_ owing to this, because unity, except through the perpetual encompassing of something, does not then exist therein. 57. For the one is this, namely, not two; (58) _and_ the two <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> are these, namely, the original _one and_ the one that is the difference of _this_ one from the other (59) which is not called two. 60. When the one is not understood, except through the whole compassing of unity, (61) and duality cannot occur, except through the separation of unit _from_ unit, (62) the one is that one in the unity, and is steadfast in unity. 63. One and two are in the pedigree (tôkhmak) of quantity _and_ numerousness; (64) and quantity, numerousness, aggregation, and separation, which, as I _have_ said, cannot occur without limitation, (65) are clear even to medium understandings.

66\. Again, _I say_ this, the unlimited is that which is not compassed by the understanding. 67. When it is not possible to compass by any understanding, _it_ is inevitable _that_ it was not possible to compass in the understanding of the sacred being. 68. It is itself the peculiarity of the sacred being, _and_ even that of the gloomy original evolution is not wholly compassed within the understanding. 69. To speak _of_ him whose own peculiarity is not compassed within his own understanding _as_ all-good and all-seeing is strange [^11], (70) because it describes a whole aggregate, (71) and an aggregate is called a whole on account of encompassment _on_ all sides. 72. _But what is_ encompassed _on_ all sides is inevitably limitedness. 73. Is it fitting to account that _as_ a sacred being when aware, from all its own encompassment, _that it_ is limited? 74. _And_ if unlimited _it_ is unaware _of it_. 75. The first knowledge of a sage is owing to his well-arranging [^12] comprehension of his own peculiarity, <span id="p248"><sup><small>[ p. 248 ]</small></sup></span> nature, and quantity; (76) _and_ to speak _of him_ who was unaware _of_ all his own peculiarity, nature, and quantity, _and_ yet wise about another nature and quantity, is strange [^13].

77\. This, too, _I say_, that as the unlimited, on account of non-encompassment, is not compassed by the understanding, (78) that _implies_ this, that all its peculiarity _may be_ wise, or there _may_ be _some_ that is ignorant; all _may be_ light, or there _may_ be _some_ that is dark; all _may be_ alive, or there _may_ be _some_ that is dead; and _one_ is unaware of it.

79\. Again, _I say_ this, that the light and the life which I obtain here are an allotment that exists owing to the selfsame Time [^14], or _they are_ not. 80. If _they be_ an allotment that exists owing to a peculiarity of Time, that _implies that men_ should well recognise this, that anything owing to whose allotment it is possible to ordain them must be provided with allotments. 81. _As to what is_ provided with allotments, except when united it is then not possible _even_ for it, (82) and _as to what is_ united, except through the uniter by whom that united _thing_ is united it does not then determine it. 83. And when the allotment made is seen _to be_ limited, the origin from which the allotment is _in_ like manner made is doubtless a limited existence. 84. As regards that, since they say that all allotment of a result is a giver of evidence _as_ to _its_ origin, (85) that _implies_, when I obtain an allotment made _and_ limited, _that_ an origin even of that, except when made and united <span id="p249"><sup><small>[ p. 249 ]</small></sup></span> from allotments _and_ limited, is then not possible to exist.

86\. This, too, _I say_, that the unlimited is not bestowed, (87) because an allotment is bestowed from an aggregate, (88) and aggregation is an evidence as to limitation, (89) as I _have_ shown above [^15]. 90. So that _as to_ the existence _and_ nature of the origin, except by the likeness and similitude of the result, I do not then attain to them. 91. Whatever is obtained in the result (92) is certain to exist _in_ like manner in the origin. 93. That _implies_ likewise from _this_ explanation, when the formation and limitation are obtainable in the result, _that_ the origin also, from which the result _arises_, is without doubt as to limitation.

94\. Again, _I say_ this, that the unlimited is that which _has_ an undisturbed position and an unbounded [^16] individuality, (95) and there is no other position _or_ resting-place for it disturbed _apart_ from it. 96. That _implies_, when two original evolutions are said _to be_ unlimited and of unbounded (asâmân) individuality, _that_ the skies _and_ earths, the rudimentary bodily formations, growths, _and_ lives, the luminaries, divinities, _and_ archangels, _and_ the many congregations (hambari<i>s</i>nân) whose different names are owing to the difference of each one _of those two_ from the other, cannot be limited. 97. What produced all those within them, and where _is it_, (98) when the two original evolutions have been eternally _in_ an undisturbed position? 99. <span id="p250"><sup><small>[ p. 250 ]</small></sup></span> Unless that individuality of theirs, which is unlimited, _be_ made limited, how is it possible _for_ a place to exist for all these _things that_ are _and_ were _and will_ be made? 100. If a nature that is always unlimited can become limited, that certainly _implies that_ it could even become nothing; (101) _and_ that which they say about the unchangeableness of a nature is strange [^17].

102\. This, too, you should understand, that the unlimited becomes that which _has_ disturbed it, which _was_ not appointed by it _at_ first; (103) nothing different from it can exist separate from it. 104. Apart from the boundary of unlimitedness it is not understood, (105) or, stupidly, _one_ does not know that thing, that is, of what _it is_ he always speaks and contends and bandies words about, _and_ thereby deludes those with a trifle of the trifles of knowledge into _some_ way _and_ whither. 106. If he uncritically [^18] says even this of it, that its individuality is unlimited, and its knowledge also, _being_ unlimited, knows through unlimited knowledge that it is unlimited, (107) that is a strange _thing_ which is twofold strange [^19]. 108. One is this, that of knowledge, except about things acquired by knowledge and compassed within knowledge, (109) nothing whatever is understood until complete, except that which is wholly compassed within knowledge and acquired, (110) which knowledge of anything arises through entire understanding of the thing. 111. _And_ entire <span id="p251"><sup><small>[ p. 251 ]</small></sup></span> understanding of anything arises through entire compass of the thing within knowledge [^20].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (243:1) Except the belief in the two original existences (whose main characteristics are, respectively, light and darkness) the account of Mânî's doctrines, given in the Fihrist of Muhammad bin Is‘hâq (see Flügel's Mânî seine Lehre and seine Schriften), appears to contain none of the details mentioned in this chapter.

[^2]: (244:1) So read by Nêr. in Pâz. and Kûnî in Sans. But there is little doubt that he is the demon Ku<i>n</i>da or Ku<i>n</i>di of Vend. XI, 28, 36, XIX, 138, whose Pahlavi name is Kûnd in Pahl. Vend. XIX, 138, and Kûndak in Bd. XXVIII, 42, in which latter he is said to be ‘the steed of wizards.’ Kûndak is written like Kûnîk in Pahl., and this latter becomes Kunî in Pâz.

[^3]: (244:2) Who are called demons (see Mkh. XXVII, 20, 40).

[^4]: (244:3) Sans. has ‘having scratched it with.’

[^5]: (244:4) Assuming that Pâz. âharâmine<i>n</i>d stands for Pahl. a-ârâmînend, ‘they do not leave at rest.’

[^6]: (245:1) The spiritual world and its inhabitants.

[^7]: (245:2) As stated in § 14.

[^8]: (245:3) Personified as Zurvân.

[^9]: (245:4) The signs of the zodiac, the celestial leaders appointed by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> (see Mkh. VIII, 18).

[^10]: (246:1) Reading ni<i>s</i>ânîh; Nêr. has Pâz. ni<i>s</i>âmî (for ni<i>s</i>îmî), Sans. âsanatvam, ‘resting-place.’

[^11]: (247:1) See Chap. XV, 39 n.

[^12]: (247:2) Assuming that Pâz. va<i>s</i> <i>h</i><i>v</i>azîra<i>s</i>ni stands for Pahl. a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>. p. 248 hû-â<i>z</i>îri<i>s</i>n; the latter word can scarcely have been hû-â<i>z</i>îri<i>s</i>nîh, ‘good arrangement.’

[^13]: (248:1) See Chap. XV, 39 n.

[^14]: (248:2) See §31.

[^15]: (249:1) See § 64.

[^16]: (249:2) Assuming that Pâz. avamãn stands for Pahl. avîmand, as it is translated by Sans. amaryâda; otherwise it might be agûmân, ‘undoubted.’

[^17]: (250:1) See Chap. XV, 39 n.

[^18]: (250:2) The first part of this word is a blank in JE, as if copied from an original that was illegible here. JJ has a<i>h</i><i>v</i>araidihâ.

[^19]: (250:3) See Chap. XV, 39 n.

[^20]: (251:1) The most complete MSS., yet discovered, break off at this point, without concluding the subject. It is quite uncertain how much of the work is lost, but, supposing that all existing MSS. are descended from AK, supposing that that MS. was originally complete, and supposing that it was divided into two equal portions (the latter of which is now lost) in consequence of some division of family property, we might then conclude, if all these assumptions were correct, that very little of the work is missing, because the portion of AK still extant extends no further than Chap. XI, 145 which is very little beyond the middle of the extant text.
