## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXVIII.

1\. The twenty-eighth subject is this, that, when they teach the Avesta, it is _in_ like manner necessary <span id="p291"><sup><small>[ p. 291 ]</small></sup></span> that they teach _it_ properly and truly, _and_ recite _it_ with deliberation and composure (sâkinî). 2. And it is necessary _for_ those who are taught to recite _it_ connectedly, and to keep _it_ ever _in_ remembrance.

3\. For it is declared in revelation, that the sacred being _has_ decreed thus: ‘_As to_ every one who puts the Avesta away from _his_ memory, I _will_ put his soul as far from heaven as the width of the earth [^1].’ 4. And in the commentary of the Avesta it is related _that_, in former times, _as to_ any one who had been taught the Avesta and had put _it_ away from _his_ memory, until the time he had again made _it_ easy, they would have given him bread like that which they give to the dogs. 5. _And in_ another place I have read that they would have given bread to him _on_ the point of a spear.
