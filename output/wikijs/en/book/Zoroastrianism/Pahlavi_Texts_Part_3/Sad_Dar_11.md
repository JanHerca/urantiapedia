## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XI.

1\. The eleventh subject is this, that it is necessary to maintain the fire-place [^1] properly, and to keep watch [^2], so that _the fire shall_ not die _out_, and _that_ nothing polluted and impure shall attain to the fire; and it is necessary to make a menstruous woman avoid _being_ within three steps _of it_. <span id="p271"><sup><small>[ p. 271 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. Because every time that they maintain a fire properly, which is within a dwelling, every fire which is in the earth of seven regions becomes pleased with those persons, and, when they ask a favour, or beg a necessity (‘hâ<i>g</i>at), it becomes quickly operative. 3. And every time that _one_ does not maintain _it_ properly, every fire which is in the earth of seven regions receives injury from that person, and the necessity he begs does not become operative. 4. If any one does not maintain the fire-place properly, if he gives a hundred dînârs [^3] to the fire Gu<i>s</i>asp [^4] _there_ is no acceptance _of it_, and that sin does not depart from him.

5\. For it is declared in revelation [^5], that the creator Hôrmazd has given sovereignty in heaven to Ardibahi<i>s</i>t [^6], the archangel, and has spoken thus: ‘_As to_ every one with whom thou art not pleased, do not let him escape into heaven.’ 6. And this is also declared in revelation, that, every time that they do not maintain the fire properly, pregnancy becomes scarcer for the women, fewer male children are born, and honour (‘hurmat) in the vicinity of the king becomes less for the men, and _there_ is no approbation (qabûl) of _their_ words.

7\. _For_ every single fire which dies out in a dwelling a loss of three dirhams and two dângs [^7] falls <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> on the property of that person, or it becomes the loss of this dwelling, or it does not reach him from the place whence wealth comes to him.
