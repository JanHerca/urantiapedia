## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER VI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘Which land is the unhappier [^1]?’

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: ‘That land is the more afflicted, in which hell is formed [^2]. 5. The second, when they slay in it a righteous man who is innocent. 6. The third, for whose sake [^3] <span id="p29"><sup><small>[ p. 29 ]</small></sup></span> the demons and fiends work. 7. The fourth, in which they construct an idol-temple. 8. The fifth, when a wicked man, who is an evil-doer, makes an abode in it. 9. The sixth, when the interment of a corpse is performed below [^4]. 10. The seventh, in which a noxious creature has a burrow. 11. The eighth, when from the possession of the good it comes into the possession of the bad. 12. The ninth, when they make desolate that which was populous. 13. _And_ the tenth, in which they make lamentation and weeping [^5].’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (28:2) This chapter is an imitation of Vend. III, 22-37, where it is stated that the five most unpleasing spots on the earth are, first, the ridge of Arezûra, on which the demons congregate from the pit of the fiend; second, where most dead dogs and men lie buried; third, where most depositories for the dead are constructed; fourth, where there are most burrows of the creatures of the evil spirit; and fifth, where the family of a righteous man is driven into captivity.

[^2]: (28:3) Bd. III, 27 states that ‘hell is in the middle of the earth.’

[^3]: (28:4) Reading mûn . . . rûnŏ-î pa<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>. Instead of drû<i>g</i>ân rânŏ, p. 29 Nêr. has read drû<i>g</i> hanrûnŏ, and assumed the last word to be equivalent to Av. ha<i>n</i>dvarena, ‘concourse;’ so as to obtain the meaning, ‘in which the demons and the fiend form a congress.’ But Av. ha<i>n</i>dvarena is Pahl. ham-dûbâri<i>s</i>nîh (see Pahl. Vend. VII, 237).

[^4]: (29:1) Or ‘when much interment of corpses is performed,’ as it is doubtful whether we ought to read a<i>v</i>îr, ‘much,’ or a<i>z</i>îr, ‘below.’

[^5]: (29:2) That is, for the dead. Such outward manifestations of mourning being considered sinful by the Parsis, as they ought to be by all unselfish people who believe in a future existence of happiness.
