## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LVIII.

1\. The fifty-eighth subject is this, that it is ever necessary that those of the good religion _should_ make an effort that they _may_ celebrate _a ceremony for their_ living souls. 2. _For_ the soul, _for which_ they have celebrated _a ceremony_ [^1], just as much good work as it then becomes each year, it is twice as much good work the second year. 3. So that, _in_ this manner, the merit of _the ceremony for_ the living soul is increasing just so much every year, while the man is living. 4. And, after that, this also occurs, that, if at the time when that person becomes an immortal soul _there_ be no one _at hand_—Srôsh [^2] _being_ the angel when _the ceremony for_ the living soul is celebrated—Srôsh, the righteous, receives the soul by <span id="p319"><sup><small>[ p. 319 ]</small></sup></span> himself, and is keeping watch _over it_ during the three days [^3], and does not forsake _it_, so that no danger _or_ harm happens to it. 5. And the fourth night he is a helper, with the angel Rashn [^4] at the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, while they make up its account and reckoning, and it goes _to_ its own place.

6\. And this _ceremony for_ the living soul is appointed for the reason that, just in the manner _that_, when an infant becomes separated from the mother, a midwife (qâbilat) is necessary for it, so that they _may_ keep watch over it, _and_ just in the manner that she takes up the infant [^5] from the ground—and, _at_ the time when it is born, it is ever necessary that _there_ be a woman present (‘hâʓ̣irat), or they _may_ perform work _for_ the infant at a time _fit_ for the demon—_in_ this same manner, when the soul is becoming separated from the body it is like an infant (<i>t</i>ifl), _and_ does not know any way to its place. 7. When they celebrate _a ceremony for_ the living soul, and have propitiated the righteous Srôsh, the righteous Srôsh becomes like the midwife, so that he receives that soul by himself, and keeps watch _that it is_ out of the hands of Aharman and the demons. 8. When they do not celebrate _a ceremony_ for the soul _when_ living, _but_, after that [^6], the priests perform _it_ before Srôsh, it is like that _which occurs_ when a woman brings forth a child [^7], _and_ after that they set _her_ before the midwife. 9. And it happens that while some one is coming in, who takes up that child and wraps _it_ up, it has perished. <span id="p320"><sup><small>[ p. 320 ]</small></sup></span> 10\. Therefore, as she does the needful which they _should_ do earlier by the hand of some one, _in_ this same manner it makes _it_ incumbent on every one to celebrate _a ceremony for_ his own living soul, so that it _may_ be free (îman) from these misfortunes. 11. _And_ [^8] that, if his decease occurs _in_ any place where _there_ may be no one who _will_ celebrate _a ceremony for_ his soul, since _a ceremony for_ the living soul is celebrated, _there_ are no arrears for him, and he is free. 12. And, in many things, it is that _ceremony for the_ living soul which is expedient, especially in these times when the priests have remained few _in_ number; _and_, when it is celebrated by one's own hands, it is a great duty.
