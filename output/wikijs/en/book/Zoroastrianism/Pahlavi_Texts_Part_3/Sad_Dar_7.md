## SAD DAR. CHAPTER VII.

1\. The seventh subject is this, that, when a sneeze (’ha<i>t</i>sat) comes forth from any one, it is requisite to recite one Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^3] and one Ashem-vohû [^4]. 2. Because there is a fiend in our bodies, and she is an adversary who is connected with mankind, and strives so that she _may_ make misfortune (’hillat) and sickness predominant (mustaûlî) over mankind. 3 And in our bodies there is a fire which they call a disposition—in Arabic they say <i>t</i>abî’hat—and they call _it_ the sneezing instinct (_gh_arîzî). 4. _It is_ connected with that fiend, _and_ they wage warfare, and it keeps her away from the body of man. 5. Then, as the fire becomes successful over <span id="p266"><sup><small>[ p. 266 ]</small></sup></span> that fiend, _and_ puts her to flight (hazîmat), a sneeze comes because that fiend comes out.

6\. Afterwards, because it is necessary, they recite these _inward_ prayers [^1] and perform the benediction (âfrîn) of the fire, so that it may remain _for_ a long period while thou art keeping [^2] this fiend defeated. 7. When another person hears the sneeze, it is likewise requisite for him to utter the said prayers, and to accomplish the benediction of that spirit [^3].
