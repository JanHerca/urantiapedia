## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER V.

1\. Another subject, among the assertors of the non-existence of a sacred being, is about the existence of the sacred being and his competitor.

2\. Of the knowledge approvable by wisdom and the statements of the limits of evidence, _about_ the existence of the sacred being and his competitor, (3) <span id="p140"><sup><small>[ p. 140 ]</small></sup></span> this is a summary:—_One_ knows it should be enjoined, that the supreme first knowledge, most _suitable_ for the well-discerning, is comprehending the sacred being. 4. He, of whom this knowledge is not the leader of knowledge, is unaided by other knowledge. 5. Comprehending the sacred being is possible through undecayed [^1] understanding, fervent intellect, and decisive wisdom.

6\. Since comprehending the sacred being is not, thus far, more than _that one_ knows that a sacred being exists, (7) because whoever is acquainted with the existence of a certain thing, and is unaware of its nature, is thinking thus, that that thing is good or bad, erudite or ignorant, antidote or poison, cold _and_ frozen or hot and scorching, dry _and_ withering or damp, (8) and, when unaware of its nature, his only knowledge of it is then useless—(9) for it is possible to cause the commendation and condemnation of any person _or_ thing, not through _its_ existence but through _its_ nature—(10) _therefore one_ knows this should be also enjoined, that a knowledge of [^2] anything is _acquired_ in three modes:—(11) by knowing _what_ is inevitable, or by knowing _what_ is analogous, or by _what_ is possible _and_ fit to exist.

12\. Inevitable knowledge is such as once one is one, and twice two are four. 13. For within the bounds of the really inevitable it is not possible to say, (14) that _there_ was _or will_ be a time, or a place, where twice two are said _to be_ five or three.

15\. Knowledge _by_ analogy is that which announces, from anything manifest, something which is not <span id="p141"><sup><small>[ p. 141 ]</small></sup></span> manifest, (16) and brings, out of anything visible, something invisible, in the likeness of a hand put up [^3], for the household service of the perception of wisdom, (17) through complete similarity, resemblance, _or_ partial resemblance.

18\. Complete similarity is such as _that of_ a man of Pârs to a man of another district. 19. Resemblance is such as _that of_ cheese to the white of an egg. 20. And partial resemblance is such as _that of_ cheese to chalk, (21) since this is about the limit of partial resemblance, because cheese is like unto chalk only in whiteness, (22) _but to_ the white of an egg in whiteness and also as food.

23\. And there is also _that_ which is called more resembling than resemblance, and more partially resembling _than_ partial resemblance. 24. That which is more _than_ complete similarity is not spoken about, (25) because completion does not become more complete.

26\. By this mode _it_ is set forth a second time at more length. 27. To demonstrate an invisible from a visible thing is such as from a thing made and maintained, which is not domestically serving the maker and maintainer, (28) and from a thing written, whose writer is not declared, (29) are manifest a maker of that _which is_ made, a maintainer of that _which is_ maintained, _and_ a writer of that _which is_ written, who are inevitable, (30) because that which is not manifest _and_ is invisible is demonstrated by the thing which is manifest and visible.

31\. Information of that which is within the possible _and_ fit to exist is credible, (32) such as what _one_ <span id="p142"><sup><small>[ p. 142 ]</small></sup></span> states thus: ‘I saw a man by whom a lion, or a lion by whom a man, _was_ slain outright.’ 33. And this, _being_ that which is within the limits of the possible _and_ fit to exist, may be a lie. 34. But when a man announces that intelligence, who is renowned for truth and tested in judgment, it is within the limits of truth and reality. 35. If a man announces _it_, who is disgraced by falsehood and tested in misjudgment, it is within the limits of falsehood and unreality.

36\. Another mode, outside of these _and_ within the limits of the inevitable, is _by knowing what has_ not occurred _and_ is not possible; (37) such as what _one_ states thus: ‘It is possible to bring the world, in secrecy, into the inside of an egg,’ (38) or ‘it is possible _for_ an elephant to pass into an eye of a needle,’ (39) _in_ such a manner _as_ though one _of them_ really becomes no greater and no less, (40) or _its_ substance is something which is not a rudiment.

41\. A struggle which should not be limited, (42) an existing thing which is not temporary and localised, (43) or is localised _and_ not limited, (44) the working of a vain miracle, (45) and other _things_ of this description of speaking _and_ imagining are faulty and false and not possible.

46\. Then [^4] the knowledge of the existence of him who is the exalted sacred being, apart from tangibility of nature and other evidence, is through the inevitable and analogy, (47) as much visible before the sight of wisdom as from the prosperity [^5], formation, and organization which are, according to different <span id="p143"><sup><small>[ p. 143 ]</small></sup></span> statements of many kinds, the formation of the things of the world and mankind whose particles, _and_ the appliances which are owing thereto, are such as the elements of the body _and_ life, from which [^6] they are prepared _and_ formed, (48) which are fire, water, air, _and_ earth, (49) that are, each separately, a stimulus so qualified and ennobled for their own operations, (50) that the operation of fire, through its own quality (<i>k</i>îharîh) and nobility (vâspûharakânîh), is such that the operations of water, air, _and_ earth are not to stimulate unrestricted (atang) [^7] by it. 51. Thus, also, the operation of water, through its own quality, is such that the operations of air, fire, _and_ earth are not _unrestricted_ by it. 52. So, also, of air, the operations of fire, water, _and_ earth are not _unrestricted by it_. 53. So, also, of earth, the operations of these _others_ are to stimulate not unrestricted _by it_. 54. But each separately is for its own operation, just as they are ennobled _and_ qualified (55) by him who is, sagaciously _and_ methodically, a qualifier, a constructor, and an ennobler. 56. _And_ the organization is constructed, prepared, qualified, _and_ ennobled as is suitable for those operations.

57\. So, also, _as to_ mankind and the other creatures, who are the germinating of these elements, (58) whose organization of bone, fat, sinew, veins, and skin, each separately (59) without sympathy, one for the other, is visible altogether. 60. Thus, too, are the nobility _and_ qualification of the internal organs, (61) such as the liver, heart [^8], lungs, kidneys, gall-bladder, _and_ <span id="p144"><sup><small>[ p. 144 ]</small></sup></span> other appliances, _for_ every one of which a function of its own is manifest. 62. They are qualified _and_ ennobled for their defence by those functions which are their own.

63\. So, also, is the qualification of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, mouth, teeth, hand, foot, _and_ other external appliances, whose own functions are each separate. 64. And _it_ is visibly manifest therein; inasmuch as, when one of these organs is disabled, any _one_ of the rest is not suitable for the work of that other _one_, for which it is not qualified. 65. And when only the construction of one of the organs of the body is examined into—that is, how _it is_—it is wonderfully sagaciously constructed [^9].

66\. Such as the eye, which is of many natures of different names and different purposes, (67) as the eyelash, the eyelid, the white, the eyeball (khâyak), the iris (sâyak), _and_ the pupil (tê<i>d</i>ak), (68) _in_ such way that the white is fat [^10], (69) the iris is water which _has_ so stood in the prison [^11] of fat that the turning of the eye, from side to side, occurs through it, (70) _and_ the pupil, itself the sight, is like a view into the water. 71. The iris stands in the prison of white, like the standing of water in a prison of fat; (72) and the pupil is within the iris, like the view of a thing within clear water, (73) _or_ the form of a column in <span id="p145"><sup><small>[ p. 145 ]</small></sup></span> a shining mirror. 74. And the arrangement of the white _in_ the orbit is for the reason that the dust whirling from the atmosphere, when it arrives at the eye, shall not be concealed in it, (75) _but_ shall turn to the lid (gumb) of the eye, (76) and shall not injure the sight of the eye. 77. Just as the construction of the tube (rag) of the ear is undilated (afâhal), for the reason (78) that whirls of dust and winged noxious creatures shall not rightly enter therein. 79. And the moisture of oneself, the secretion of the ear, and the venom of noxious creatures are manifestly as _useful_ [^12].

80\. When the appliances of life and soul are observed—(81) such as the smell, hearing; sight, taste, and touch which are causing the intelligence of living beings, (82) as also the wisdom of every pontiff (ra<i>d</i>), _which_ is pronounced decisive, (83) the knowledge which is acquiring, (84) the intellect which is a seeker _and_ transmitter, (85) the understanding which is a treasurer _and_ defender, (86) the consciousness which is itself the sight of the soul, (87) the guardian spirit (fravash) which is itself the nature that is a maintainer of the body, (88) the spiritual life (ahû) which is pure, (89) and the other spiritual _existences_ that are maintaining the body, which are each separately qualified, in that manner [^13], _for_ their operation and duty—(90) they are perfect in their own operation, as to duty such as they are ennobled _and_ qualified _for_. 91. As to that _for_ which they are not qualified, they are not suitable.

92\. The two _arguments_ which are each separate <span id="p146"><sup><small>[ p. 146 ]</small></sup></span> in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> manuscript, as the supremely learned _one_ [^14] _has_ explained _them_ out of _his_ knowledge of the religion, are here set forth at length. 93. _He_ whose wish is to fully understand the wonderfulness of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion and the statements of the primitive faith, (94) examines into it in a manuscript of that character, (95) _and_ shall understand more fully the wonderfulness and truth of the religion [^15].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (140:1) Assuming that Pâz. agunast (Sans. anâvila) stands for Pahl. agôndî<i>d</i>; but it may stand for Pahl. agûngî<i>d</i>, ‘unsilenced.’

[^2]: (140:2) Sans. inserts ‘the nature of.’

[^3]: (141:1) As a finger-post.

[^4]: (142:1) Reading adîna<i>s</i>, ‘then of him,’ for Pâz. ainâ, as in Chap. IV, 81. Having explained the modes of arguing, in §§ 12-45, the author now returns to the argument itself.

[^5]: (142:2) So in Sans., but bâhar-hômandîh also means ‘divisibility.’

[^6]: (143:1) Reading mûn a<i>z</i>a<i>s</i> for Pâz. ke va<i>s</i>.

[^7]: (143:2) See Chap. III, 30 n.

[^8]: (143:3) Assuming that Pâz. dawur is a misreading of Pahl. dîl.

[^9]: (144:1) So in Sans., but the Pahl. text may be translated ‘how wonderful _it is_, it is sagaciously constructed.’

[^10]: (144:2) Assuming that Pâz. p<i>e</i>gh, as well as pih in § 69 and peh in § 71, stands for Pahl. pîk (Pers. pî), ‘fat’ It might also be connected with Pers. pikah, ‘a veil,’ as Nêr. seems to have understood it here; but ‘fat’ suits the whole context better.

[^11]: (144:3) Reading lag, instead of rag, ‘a vein,’ which latter is adopted by Nêr. both here and in § 71.

[^12]: (145:1) As means of defence.

[^13]: (145:2) By the assistance of the senses mentioned in § 81.

[^14]: (146:1) Âtû<i>r</i>\-frôbag (see Chap. IV, 107).

[^15]: (146:2) Nearly all the Pahlavi manuscripts of this work terminate here.
