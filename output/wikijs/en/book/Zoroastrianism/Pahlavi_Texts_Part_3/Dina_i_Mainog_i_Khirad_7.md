## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER VII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘How is heaven, and how many? 3. How are the ever-stationary (hamîstân), and how many? 4. And how is hell, and how many? 5. What is the decision _about_ the righteous in heaven, and from what is _their_ happiness? 6. What are the misery and affliction of the wicked in hell? 7. And what and how is the decision _about_ those who are among the ever-stationary?’

8\. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: 'Heaven is, first, from the star station unto the <span id="p30"><sup><small>[ p. 30 ]</small></sup></span> moon station; (10) second, from the moon station unto the sun; (11) _and_, third, from the sun station unto the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânô), whereon the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is seated. 12. Of heaven the first _part_ is _that of_ good thoughts (hûmatô), the second is _that of_ good words (hûkhtô), and the third is that of good deeds (hûvar<i>s</i>tô).

13\. 'The righteous in heaven are undecaying and immortal, unalarmed, undistressed, and undisturbed. 14. And, everywhere [^1], they are full of glory, fragrant, and joyful, full of delight and full of happiness. 15. And, _at_ all times, a fragrant breeze and a scent which is like sweet basil come to meet _them_, which are more pleasant than every pleasure, and more fragrant than every fragrance. 16. For them, also, there is no satiety owing to the existence in heaven. 17. And their sitting and walking, perception and enjoyment are with the angels and archangels and the righteous for ever and everlasting.

18\. 'Regarding the ever-stationary _it_ is declared, that _they are_ from the earth unto the star station; (19) and its affliction for them is then [^2] nothing whatever except cold and heat.

20\. 'Of hell the _first_ part is _that of_ evil thoughts (dû<i>s</i>\-hûmatô), the second is _that of_ evil words (dû<i>s</i>\-hûkhtô), and the third is _that of_ evil deeds <span id="p31"><sup><small>[ p. 31 ]</small></sup></span> (dû<i>s</i>\-hûvar<i>s</i>tô) [^3]. 21. _With_ the fourth step the wicked person arrives at that which is the darkest hell; (22) and they lead him forwards to the vicinity of Aharman, the wicked. 23. And Aharman and the demons, thereupon, make ridicule and mockery of him (24) thus [^4]: "What was thy trouble and complaint, as regards Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels, and the fragrant and joyful heaven, when thou approachedst for a sight of us and gloomy hell, (25) although we cause thee misery therein and do not pity, and thou shalt see misery of long duration?" 26. And, afterwards, they execute punishment and torment of various kinds upon him.

27\. ‘There is a place [^5] where, as to cold, _it_ is such as that of the coldest frozen [^6] snow. 28. There is a place where, as to heat, _it_ is such as that of the hottest and most blazing fire. 29. There is a place where noxious creatures are gnawing them, just as a dog _does_ the bones. 30. There is a place where, as to stench, _it_ is such that they stagger about (ba<i>r</i>â lar<i>z</i>ênd) [^7] _and_ fall down. 31. And the darkness <span id="p32"><sup><small>[ p. 32 ]</small></sup></span> is always such-like as though it is possible for them to seize upon _it_ with the hand [^8].’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (30:1) Nêr. has ‘at all times,’ which may be correct, as gâs means both ‘time’ and ‘place.’ It should be noticed, however, that the word used in § 15 is damân, which means ‘time’ only.

[^2]: (30:2) Nêr. has ‘their affliction is otherwise,’ by mistaking Huz. adîna<i>s</i>\-<i>s</i>ân, ‘then its . . . for them,’ for a supposed Pâz. ainâ<i>s</i>ã, ‘otherwise their,’ which seems to have no real existence, as wherever he reads ainâ, ‘otherwise,’ the Pahl. text has adîna<i>s</i>, ‘then its.’

[^3]: (31:1) These names, as here written, mean literally ‘evil good thoughts, evil good words, and evil good deeds,’ as if they implied that these places are for those whose best thoughts, words, and deeds are evil; but it is not quite certain that the Pahlavi names are spelt correctly.

[^4]: (31:2) As already stated in Chap. II, 183-186.

[^5]: (31:3) L19 has ‘he is experienced’ in §§ 27-30, owing to Nêr. having read dânâk, ‘knowing, experienced,’ instead of dîvâk, ‘a place.’

[^6]: (31:4) Literally, ‘stone-possessing, stony’ if we read sang-dâr, as seems most plausible; but we might read sôkhâr and consider Pers. khasâr or khasar, ‘ice,’ as a corruption of it, by transposition. L19 has ‘ice (yah) and snow.’

[^7]: (31:5) L19 has b<i>e</i> r<i>e</i><i>z</i>e<i>n</i>d, ‘they vomit up,’ which is evidently a misreading.

[^8]: (32:1) ‘Even darkness _which_ may be felt’ (Ex. x. 21).
