## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER XI.

1\. Henceforth I write [^1] _of_ the inconsistency of their twaddle, and _of_ just observations (2) you should estimate with wise regard.

3\. First, _as to_ the full consideration of that one original evolution (4) which they state thus: ‘The sacred being is one, doing good works, wise, powerful, compassionate, _and_ merciful, (5) so that good works _and_ crime, truth _and_ falsehood, life _and_ death, good _and_ evil are [^2] owing to him [^3].’

6\. Now do ye ask of them (7) thus: 'Is the sacred being always compassionate _and_ showing mercy, doing good works _and_ judicious, and does he know all _that_ is, was, _and will_ be; _and_ is _he_ advancing the desire of _one's_ wishes in everything, even _in_ this where judiciousness is interference, or when such is not so? 8. Because, if _he be_ compassionate, doing good works, _and_ showing mercy, why then are Aharman and the demons and all these evil faiths [^4] of hell admitted [^5] <span id="p174"><sup><small>[ p. 174 ]</small></sup></span> by him to his own creatures, through his own compassion, doing of good works, _and_ showing of mercy? 9. If not known by him, where are that knowledge and omniscience of his? 10. If he did not wish to keep misery and evil away from the creatures, and to produce only happiness _for_ every one, where are that judiciousness and interference of his? 11. If it were not possible that it should not be produced by him, for what is that omnipotence of his (12) which we [^6] every one, as _it were_, observe _and_ well consider?'

13\. Whenever they say _that_ every good and evil _has_ arisen from the sacred being—except when they separate from him these four attributes (hûnar), requisite for divinity, which are omniscience, omnipotence, goodness, _and_ mercifulness—(14) there is then no possibility of it. 15. When, indeed, they separate from him _only_ one of these four attributes, even then _he_ is not complete in divinity. 16. For if a sacred being be he _who is_ omniscient, omnipotent, good, and merciful, then he who is not omniscient, _or_ not omnipotent, _or_ not good, or not merciful is not a sacred being.

17\. Again, _observe_ this, that when _he is_ a ruler, advancing desires in every person _and_ thing, why are that country and empire of his own not so kept, without help, from every enemy and adversity _apart_ from his own work, so that _there_ would not be anything whatever of distress, oppression, injustice, and complaint for any one in his empire? 18. Since the <span id="p175"><sup><small>[ p. 175 ]</small></sup></span> rule _and_ empire of a man, _who is_ ruler and emperor, are then commendable when _it_ is possible for him so to protect _and_ keep his own country _and_ empire, through his own wisdom, that they _may_ not assist his enemy to detract from his work, and to produce sin _and_ harm. 19. Or, when his enemy covets _some_ of his work, he is enabled to keep him away from his own thoughtful friends, _and_ to make every one free from distress.

20\. Again, _observe_ this, that when _he is_ triumphant, victorious, and prevailing, (21) over whom are that triumph, victory, and prevailing of his? 22. Since triumph and victory are over enemies, a competitor exists. 23. It is not expedient [^7] to become himself a competitor _and_ enemy to his own; (24) while when there is no enemy _and_ competitor of his, over whom does he become triumphant and victorious? 25. That _sort of_ triumph and victory is not spoken about, (26) because even cattle and sheep, when they have no opponent and injurer, are victorious and triumphant over themselves.

27\. Again, _observe_ this, is a wise _being_ contented with his own divinity and grandeur, or not? 28. If the wise _being_ be contented, then he _has_ become contented to produce an enemy and criminal, _and_ to admit all _that is_ devastating into a country, through his own knowledge and will, for the benefit of the <span id="p176"><sup><small>[ p. 176 ]</small></sup></span> country and creatures. 29. _But_ why [^8] is it expedient to seek a disposition of crime _and_ evil, to become himself an enemy _and_ curser as regards them, _and_ to provide a hellish _existence_, becoming the misery of mankind?

30\. Again, _observe_ this, _as to_ whatever he says, does he speak truly _and_ credibly, or not? 31. If he speaks that truly _and_ credibly which he states thus: ‘I am a friend of good works and an enemy of crime,’ (32) _and_ always produces more crime _and_ criminals than good works _and_ doers of good works, (33) where is that truthful speaking of his?

34\. Again, _observe_ this, is his desire goodness, or vileness? 35. If his desire _be_ vileness, whence is that divinity of his? 36. If his desire _be_ goodness, then why are the vile and vileness more than the good and goodness?

37\. Again, _observe_ this, is he merciful, or not? 38. If he _be_ not merciful, whence is that divinity of his? 39. If he _be_ merciful, then why does he speak thus: ‘The hearts, ears, _and_ eyes of mankind are bent about by me, so that it is not possible for them to think, speak, _or_ do _anything_ but that which is wanted by me [^9]; (40) be it what _has_ made them great _and_ noble, through _being_ without want; (41) _or_ be it what _has_ admitted them to eternal hell, slain _and_ exterminated by death of many kinds. 42. So that while those whom I force back become good _and_ more active in good works, (43) yet still those who <span id="p177"><sup><small>[ p. 177 ]</small></sup></span> are forced back do only a little [^10], (44) _and_ are much more criminal _and_ more sinful than those who are forward.’

45\. Again, _observe_ this, that if, whatever he does, he does wisely and for a purpose, (46) then, when no opponent and adversary of his existed, why _did_ the first achievement which _was_ prepared by him _become_ servants to demoniacal disobedience, who are perverted thereby, among mankind, to wickedness _and_ a hellish _existence_ [^11]? 47. If _it were_ not known by him that they _would_ become perverted, it was expedient (sa<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>) for him to order the making of a trial of them, (48) because now many thousands _and_ myriads who _are_ prepared by him, so that they _may_ serve him and exhilarate (mastend) his rule, have become in every mode disobedient _and_ unhappily advised. 49. for with that scanty knowledge that mankind _possess_, which is not so prepared _and_ organized as is the wish of mankind, (50) if even anything arises, that they construct _and_ prepare, which does not so come on _and_ become [^12] as is their wish, they do not stop again, a second _time_, for the preparation of that thing, _but_ they refrain from it.

51\. _As to_ him, that omnipotent _and_ omniscient ruler, of the abundant _and_ innumerable things _he has_ hitherto made and prepared not even one comes on _and_ becomes such as is his wish, yet still he never refrains from the preparation _and_ production of many new _things_. 52. Just as when _he was_ the creator of <span id="p178"><sup><small>[ p. 178 ]</small></sup></span> that _one_ of his first angels whom, on account of affection, he prepared out of fire, _and for_ several thousand years, (53) as they say, _they_ always performed his worship; (54) at last _that one was_ undone by one command that was given by him (the creator) thus: ‘Offer homage to this first of mankind, who is prepared by me out of clay.’ 55. And deliverance, as to _what_ is not expedient to offer, _was_ expressly mentioned by him. 56. Then _that one_ acted scornfully _and_ contemptibly as to his clay and curse and wrath; (57) and, _being_ perverted to devilry and fiendishness, _he was_ forced out of heaven, (58) _and was_ given a life of millenniums _and_ an eternal dominion, (59) so that _he said_, ‘I _will_ go _and_ make my servants and worshippers astray _and_ deluded [^13].’ 60. And he _was_ made an injurer and adversary at his own will.

61\. _At_ last also that man, to whom he, the supreme angel, was ordered to offer homage with many worshippers, for the sake of affection and respect, (62) is appointed to the garden of paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t), (63) <span id="p179"><sup><small>[ p. 179 ]</small></sup></span> so that he _may_ cultivate _it_ and eat all the fruit, (64) except _of_ that one tree of which _it_ is ordered thus: Ye shall not eat _of it_ [^14].' 65. And with them (mankind) the deceiver, who is the deluder prepared by him (the creator), (66) is let into the garden. 67. There are _some_ who say _he is_ a serpent [^15], _and_ there are _some_ who _say he is_ Aharman [^16]. 68. And an inclination _for_ eating _and_ greediness is given by that same _one_ himself to mankind. 69. Then, being deceived _by_ that deluder _saying:_ ‘Eat of that tree’—(70) there are _some_ who say _he spoke to_ Adam—(71) they ate through that inclination for eating [^17].

72\. After eating they became so imbued with knowledge that good and evil _were_ understood and known by them [^18]. 73: _Deprived_ of that so-great respect and affection, through that one injunction which _was_ forgotten by them—(74) and that forgetfulness _being_ likewise owing to that cause—(75) they are forced out of the garden of paradise [^19]—_he_ with _his_ wife—by grievous wrath and disrespect, (76) _and_ are delivered into the hand of that enemy who is a deceiver and deluder; (77) so that he _has_ propagated <span id="p180"><sup><small>[ p. 180 ]</small></sup></span> his own will among them, _and has_ fashioned _it_ upon them.

78\. Now which _was_ unjust, the unreasonable command, the after-wisdom, _or_ the scanty knowledge that _was_ more faulty and more mischievous than these? 79. Also this, that is, why _was_ that garden not made by him fortified and strong, so that that deluder could not have gone into _it?_

80\. Even now he (_the deceiver_) _has_ made and makes multitudes _of_ his (the creator's) servants _and_ worshippers deluded; (81) and, for the same reason, multitudes _of_ apostles _and_ prophets (vakhshvarân) are appointed by him (the creator) for the worldly _existence at_ various times, (82) so that, _as he says:_ ‘They _may_ save my servants from the hand of that deluder, (83) _and_ bring them into the true path and way [^20].’ 84. And even those worshippers of his, _in_ every way through their own will, have slain _and_ subdued (khvâft), by a wretched death, his own apostles [^21], whose diligence had brought mankind into the proper path and doctrine.

85\. That original deluder and misleader is allowed an eternal life. 86. _And_, even till now, his will is more triumphant _and_ absolute than that of the sacred being, through deluding _and_ misleading, (87) because those deluded _and_ astray are much more numerous than those in the true path _and_ undeluded.

88\. Again, _observe_ this, does he do whatever he <span id="p181"><sup><small>[ p. 181 ]</small></sup></span> does for a purpose, or not? 89. If he does _it_ without a purpose, _he_ is working foolishly; (90) and it is not proper to praise him who is working foolishly as a sagacious divinity. 91. If he does _it_ for a purpose, (92) then, when no opponent and adversary of his existed, why is the production of all these creatures which are even like demons, disobedient men _with_ the opposing will of that contentious deluder, and innumerable unprofitable creatures?

93\. Again, _observe_ this, that, if he knows all _that_ is, was, _and will_ be, it was not expedient for him to produce, through his own knowledge and will, anything of that of which he _may be_ sorry, and _which_ remains opposing his will and command, (94) and becomes an adversary of his apostles _and_ the doers of _his_ will.

95\. If they say that this adversary _was_ produced good and virtuous from the beginning, _and_ afterwards became an evil and a misleading of the creatures, (96) that _implies_, you should say, that, when he is all-powerful, the purpose _and_ will of the adversary, in changing into an evil and a misleading of the creatures, are more successful and more powerful than those of the sacred being; (97) because the evil in _any_ period is stronger than the good.

98\. Again, _observe_ this, that when a criminal _arises_ wholly through his will [^22], (99) and the minds of criminals are defiled by him himself, (100) and the seed of crime is sown by him himself, (101) when [^23] _it has_ grown who _has_ maintained _its_ origin? 102. <span id="p182"><sup><small>[ p. 182 ]</small></sup></span> _And_ by what power of adjudication is one executed _and_ one rewarded [^24]?

103\. Again, _observe_ this, _was_ this world made and created by him (the creator) for a purpose, for his own pleasure _and_ for the sake of the comfort and happiness of mankind, or without a purpose, for his own discomfort and the hurry, trouble, pain, _and_ death of mankind? 104. For if made by him without a purpose, _he was_ acting foolishly; (105) a thing without a purpose _being_ not acceptable by the wise. 106. If made by him for a purpose, and created by him for his own pleasure and the comfort and happiness of mankind, (107) why _was_ it not made by him prosperous _and_ full of happiness?

108\. If his pleasure and happiness _arise_ from the preparation of mankind and the creatures, what is the advantage from their slaughter and devastation? 109. If thoughts of crime are not given by him himself to mankind, who is he who gives thoughts of crime different from his command and will? 110. If _they_ are given by him himself, and he now considers them a fault, what is that justice and arbitration of his owing to? 111. For when mankind, with little knowledge and little wisdom, even then, so far as they are able, do not let the lion and wolf _and_ other noxious creatures in among their own young ones _and_ pregnant _females_, (112) so long as they can destroy them, (113) why _has_ the merciful sacred being now let [^25] Aharman and the demons in upon his own creatures, (114) so that they have <span id="p183"><sup><small>[ p. 183 ]</small></sup></span> made them vile [^26], defiled, wicked, _and_ hellish? 115. If done for the sake of experiment, just as that which they assert, that evil _was_ created by him for the sake of an experiment as regards the creatures, (116) why _was_ it not understood by him before those men and creatures _existed?_ 117. Because _he_ whose custom [^27] is experiment is not to be called omniscient.

118\. The conclusion is this, that the sacred being, if _there_ existed no opponent and adversary of his, was able to create all those creatures and creations of his free from misfortune; why did _he_ not _so_ create _them?_ 119. Or was it not possible for him to wish _it?_ 120. If it were not possible for him to wish _it, he_ is not completely capable. 121. If it were possible for him not to wish _it, he_ is not merciful. 122. If _it were_ known by him that _he might say:_ ‘Something _or_ some one _will_ arise, from these creatures _and_ creations which I create, that _will_ not _be_ according to my will,’ (123) and ultimately he made _them_, (124) then to attach now all this wrath _and_ cursing and casting away for punishment in hell, discontentedly to his own performance, is unreasonable.

125\. Again, _observe_ this, that if all the crime-meditating _and_ crime-committing sin which mankind think _and_ speak _and_ do, as well as pain, sickness, poverty, _and_ the punishment _and_ misery of hell, cannot arise, except by the will and command of the <span id="p184"><sup><small>[ p. 184 ]</small></sup></span> sacred being—(126) the will _and_ power of the sacred being _being_ eternal [^28], (127) because his self-existence is also eternal—(128) the hopelessness of eternally saving any one whatever from misery and punishment is now certain. 129. For _it_ is repeatedly declared that there is no learned teacher whatever who keeps one away from these mischievous evil desires, (130) if the worshipper _be even of_ the same kind _as_ those worshippers _and_ high-priests who _have_ issued to mankind this admonition: ‘Commit no crime _and_ sin.’ 131. Because they wish to set aside the will _and_ command of the sacred being [^29]. 132. _Observe_ this, too, that, as both are his will, alike crime _and_ alike good works, _it_ is not manifest whether he approves the good works of doers of good works more, or the crimes of criminals.

133\. Likewise _observe_ this, those physicians who, on account of the hope of the soul, prepare the medicine of the sick, (134) and remove _and_ dismiss their pain and disease, (115) so that merit is possessed by them (the physicians) owing to that practice; (136) yet they [^30] are prepared for the punishment of hell. 137. And those who, on account of affection _for_ the soul, give something _to_ poor, begging, suffering people, (138) and thereby scatter [^31] _and_ dismiss their want _and_ poverty, (139) so that merit is possessed by them (the charitable) <span id="p185"><sup><small>[ p. 185 ]</small></sup></span> owing to that practice; (140) yet it becomes grievous sin for them [^32], through anxiety. 141. If they say that those physicians _and_ the remedies which they offer, _and_ also those who give something _to_ the poor _and_ suffering, all _exist_ by the will of the sacred being, (142) it is easier, more reasonable, _and_ more adapted to divinity, when the sacred being is without an adversary _and_ without an opponent, for him not to create that disease _and_ poverty (143) than _that, as to_ those that _he_ himself is to make sick _and_ poor, he _should have_ commanded mankind thus: ‘Ye shall make them healthy _and_ free from want.’ 144. If they say that his desire is this, that he _may_ occasion the happiness of those physicians _and_ givers by the recompense for it, (145) and make them proceed [^33] to the eternal happiness of heaven (vahi<i>s</i>t); (146) you should observe, _as to_ that, since he acts injudiciously _and_ incapably when, on account of the existence of a complete desire for happiness _and_ prosperity [^34] among others, _he_ is an attainer of misery _for_ multitudes _of_ the innocent who are distressed, poor, necessitous, _and_ sick, (147) this _may_ also _be said_, that if _it be_ not possible for him to occasion happiness and prosperity [^35] as regards one, except by the distress, pain, and vexation of some other, (148) that _shows that_ his absolute power _and_ freedom from opposition are not adapted for effectual operation. 149. If they say <span id="p186"><sup><small>[ p. 186 ]</small></sup></span> that he makes those sick _and_ poor proceed to the eternal happiness of heaven in the spiritual _existence_, as a recompense for it, (150) that _implies_, if _it be_ not possible, _or_ not completely possible, for him to give the recompense in the spiritual _existence_, except through the misery of the worldly _one_, (151) also this, that—his production of distress in the worldly _existence arising_ unquestionably _and_ unreasonably, through _its_ previous occurrence, (152) _and_ the recompense of the spiritual _existence arising_ doubtfully _and_ incredibly after the production of the distress—(153) just as the previous distress is unreasonable, the after recompense _occurs_ alike unreasonably _and_ foolishly. 154. This also _may be said_, that no after nobility is obtained for previous distress without a cause.

155\. Again, _observe_ this, that the existence of one of these three doctrines is inevitable:—(156) Every single thing that is, _or_ was, _or will_ be in this world is all by his will, or _it_ is not, (157) or there are _some_ that are by his will _and_ there are _some_ that are not. 158. Because nothing whatever is found which is not good, or evil, or a mixture [^36] of both.

159\. If they say that all _things_ are _by_ his will, the good and evil are both his desire. 160. If good and evil are both his desire, _he_ is not of perfect will; (161) _it_ is not perfect even as to a single _thing_. 162. And he who is of imperfect will must be himself imperfect, (163) as is shown above [^37].

164\. If nothing _be by_ his will, (165) on account of nothing being _by_ the will there is no will. 166. He _in_ whom there is no will is working constitutionally [^38], <span id="p187"><sup><small>[ p. 187 ]</small></sup></span> (167) and he who is working constitutionally is constituted _and_ made.

168\. If there be _some things_ which are _by_ his will, _and_ there be _some_ which are not _by_ his will, (169) _and_ nothing is found in the world which is not good and not evil, (170) _from_ that _it_ is known _that_, if the sacred being _be of_ good will, _he_ is not desirous of that evil of it, (171) and that which is evil is not by his will. 172. If his will _be_ evil _he_ is inevitably not desirous of that good of it, (173) _and_ that which is good is not by his will. 174. If that which is good _be by_ the will of the sacred being, _it_ is known _that_ that which is evil arose from another will. 175. If that which is evil _be by_ his will, that which is good arose inevitably from another will. 176. _And_ the inevitability _of_ a rival _of_ the will of the sacred being is manifest.

177\. If _one_ says the evil springs from mankind, (178) that _implies_ the inevitability—since mankind is not perpetually a self-existence—_that_ evil either arose before mankind, or after, (179) or it arose with mankind. 180. If they say it arose before mankind, (181) that _implies_—since, apart from the sacred being, _there_ was no other creator and producer (182) _that_ either the sacred being produced that evil, or it produced its own existence itself, or it was itself eternal. 183. If they say it arose after mankind, (184) _as to_ that, when human nature is likewise a production of the sacred being, (185) and the sacred being did not produce evil in the nature of mankind, (186) how has it sprung into action from them? 187. If the evil _was_ set in action by them, apart from the will of the sacred being, (188) and a knowledge, as to _their_ setting about it, existed _in_ <span id="p188"><sup><small>[ p. 188 ]</small></sup></span> the sacred being, (189) that _implies that_ the sacred being is imperfect in his own will, (190) and mankind are victorious and triumphant in setting aside the will _and_ command of the sacred being, and doing the evil competing _with_ the will of the sacred being. 191. Also the power of the sacred being in his own will and his own servants is manifestly unprevailing. 192. If they say that he makes them proceed afterwards to the awful punishment of hell, (193) _as to_ that [^39], if the sacred being _be_ a powerful doer, _and_ not to allow the committal of crime, _but_ to convey _it_ away from their minds, _be_ more advantageous _and_ more adapted to the compassion of a sacred being than _if_ he allowed the committal, (194) _yet he has_ become helplessly contented with it, (195) _and_, afterwards, contentedly punishes his own creatures, (196) _then_, as to the one matter I am well considering, either incapability, or scanty knowledge, or scanty goodness is thereby manifested.

197\. If they say that the sacred being produced and created evil for the reason that so mankind _may_ fully understand the value of goodness, (198) _as to_ that you should observe that, if evil _be_ requisite and advantageous for understanding goodness, that evil exists _by_ his good will. 199. _And_ if evil exists _by_ his good will, and is requisite _and_ advantageous for him _of_ whom they say that evil is not his wish, _it_ is inconsistent.

200\. _As to_ that also which they say, that death, pain, _and_ poverty _are_ produced by him for the reason that so mankind _may_ much better understand the value of life, health, and opulence, (201) _and_ become more grateful unto the sacred being, (202) _as to_ that <span id="p189"><sup><small>[ p. 189 ]</small></sup></span> you should observe that _it_ is as _it were_ acting unreasonably, in the mode of him who gives poison to mankind for the sake of increasing the value _and_ price of an antidote, (203) so that he _may_ sell the antidote dearer _and_ more costly. 204. To what is this intermeddling action owing, that, for the sake of an understanding of the value of the goodness of other _things_, he allows pain, death, _and_ misery in some one else?

205\. Again, _as to_ that which a multitude of them say, that the sacred being is a ruler over every creature and creation, (206) because his creations are all his own. 207. _And_ he acts about them as is desirable for him, because it is desirable for him, _and he_ is not a causer of distress. 208. Since distress is that which they inflict upon anything that is not their own, (209) then the who, all things _being_ his own, acts about them as is desirable for him, is not a causer of distress [^40]. 210. _As to_ that you should know that, if, on account of sovereignty, he who occasions distress is not to be called a causer of distress, (211) that is _as though_ even he who is a sovereign _and_ tells a lie is speaking truthfully, (212) and he who, on account of sovereignty, commits crime, sin, theft, _and_ plunder is not to be called a sinner. 213. Such as that which the glorified Rôshan [^41], son of Âtûr-frôbag, related as a parable (ângunî-aîtak), (214) that they saw a man who was defiling an ass, (215) when they enquired of him <span id="p190"><sup><small>[ p. 190 ]</small></sup></span> thus: ‘Why dost thou commit this execrable action?’ 216. And he spoke thus, in excuse: ‘The ass is my own.’

217\. Again, you should ask this of them, (218) that is: ‘Is the sacred being a friend, or an enemy, to these creatures and creations which are made by him?’ 219. If _he be_ a friend of the creatures, that _implies that_ it is not proper for him to desire _and_ to produce the evil _and_ misery of the creatures; (220) _yet_, as regards the devastation and misery of his own achievements, _he has_ never even become tired of them. 221. If _he be_ an enemy of the creatures, that _implies that_ it is not proper for him to create _and_ produce, through his own competent knowledge, that thing which is his enemy _and_ disablement [^42], and struggles against his will.

222\. This, too, you should ask, (223) that is: ‘Is the sacred being always a well-understanding, good sovereign, occasioning prosperity [^43], (224) or an evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning distress? 225. Or is there a time when _he is_ a well-understanding, good sovereign, occasioning prosperity, (226) and is there a time when _he is_ an evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning distress?’

227\. If _he be_ always a well-understanding, good sovereign, occasioning prosperity, (228) that _implies that_ there are not, in his country _and_ sovereignty, _any_ oppression, distress, and complaint; (229) and his affection _for_ the creatures and the affection of the creatures for him are pure. 230. Owing to the <span id="p191"><sup><small>[ p. 191 ]</small></sup></span> same reason _he is_ merciful as regards his own creatures, (231) and his creatures are recounting _his_ praise, utterers of thanksgivings _and_ pure friends towards him. 232. His title of divinity, moreover, is worthily his own.

233\. If _he be_ an evil-understanding, bad sovereign, occasioning distress, (234) that _implies that he is_ himself a pure [^44] enemy to the creatures, and his creatures are also _of_ a like nature towards him. 235. Owing to the same reason _he is_ an injurer, destroyer, _and_ deluder of the creatures, (236) and his creatures are complainers of him, strugglers concerning him, _and_ pure enemies. 237. His title of divinity, moreover, is the equivalent of an unworthy name; (238) and, even on account of his eternity, the creatures are hopeless of becoming free from the risk of distress and misery for an unlimited time.

239\. If there be a time when _he is_ a good sovereign, well-understanding, _and_ occasioning prosperity, and there be a time when _he_ is turned away from this; (240) that _implies that_ his affection for the creatures is mingled. 241. From a mingled affection _arises_ mingled action, (242) _and_ from mingled action a mingled individuality is also manifested. 243. And his creatures also are mingled friends to him. 244. Of _one's_ associates _there_ is none who, if a friend, is not one's enemy, no praiser who is not complaining of one, no glorifier even who is not scorning one; a character of this description is manifest among all creatures.

245\. Again, _observe_ this, that since all things which are in the world are not outside of these two terms, <span id="p192"><sup><small>[ p. 192 ]</small></sup></span> good and evil, (246) that _implies_, if good and evil are both said _to arise_ from the sacred being and through the will of the sacred being, (247) _that_ the troublesome Aharman is unreasonably defamed; _that, being_ innocent _and_ without an original evolution, he never was, nor _will_ be, evil and headstrong [^45]. 248. That which is mentioned in scripture (nipîk) [^46], that Aharman became headstrong, and was put out of heaven by them, is unreasonable, (249) because even that headstrongness _and_ disobedience _were_ likewise through the will of the sacred being.

250\. If even it be said _that_ the good _arises_ from the sacred being and through the will of the sacred being, _and_ the evil from mankind, still Aharman is without an original evolution _and_ innocent, and curses _and_ scorn for him are unreasonable. 251. If all this misery and evil _be_ sent down, not from a different nature, but from the individuality and individual nature of the sacred being himself, (252) that _implies that_ the sacred being is an enemy _and_ adversary to his own tendencies (rûn).

253\. _Observe_ this, too, that to speak of the existence of criminality apart from a nature of crime is very deluding; (254) _and_ as _it_ is deluding to imagine a nature of crime that is good, _is it_ more deluding to imagine Aharman—who is the origin _and_ original evolution of every crime—_apart_ from the creation and achievement of the sacred being?

255\. The conclusion is this, that if _at_ first there be anything which is not within the will of the sacred being, provided everything be through the will of the sacred being, no one whatever is a sinner; (256) <span id="p193"><sup><small>[ p. 193 ]</small></sup></span> and the apostle [^47] and religion _were_ appointed without a purpose. 257. If it be expedient to ruin any one for sinfulness, it is more expedient to ruin him who is the original doer, maintainer, and creator of every evil and crime. 258. And if it be said _that_ evil and crime _arise_ from Aharman or mankind, that _implies_, as they are likewise created and produced _by_ the sacred being, _that_ he is the source of them; in like manner, he who is the cause of the origin of evil (259) is worse than evil.

260\. This, too, you should observe, that sects (kêshân) of every kind assert this _maxim_, handed down by their own high-priests, when _it_ is mentioned and prescribed by them to their own congregation (ram), that is: ‘Perform good works _and_ abstain from crime.’ 261. On account of delusion they do not consider this, that is, from where and what origin ought the crime to arise, about which _it_ is thus commanded: ‘Ye shall not commit _it, and_ I _will_ cast _him_ who commits _it_ into eternal hell.’ 262. So that, if _that_ same _be_ owing to the sacred being, it would be easier for him not to produce it, than, after _its_ production, _to have_ brought _it_ to notice and commanded _us_ to abstain from it. 263. So far, indeed, I do not understand any advantage and motive _in_ the production and creation of evil.

264\. Again, in their scriptures, he speaks inconsistently about good works and crime (265) thus: ‘Good works and crime are both owing to me. 266. Neither demons, nor wizards, are unrestricted in causing the ruin of any one. 267. No one _has_ accepted the religion _and_ done good works, and no one _has_ walked in infidelity _and_ committed crime, except through my will.’ <span id="p194"><sup><small>[ p. 194 ]</small></sup></span> 268. In the same scripture he adduces many _things_ which _one has_ to connect, and inflicts curses on the creatures, (269) thus: ‘Why do mankind desire _and_ commit that crime which I design for them?’ 270. It occurs concerning the will and work of his own hand, and _yet_ he frightens them with punishment in body and soul. 271. _In_ another place he speaks thus: ‘I myself am the deluder of mankind, for if it should be my will they _would_ then be shown the true path by me, but _it is_ my will that they go to hell [^48].’ 272. And _in_ another place he speaks thus: ‘Man himself is the causer of crime.’

273\. In these three modes the sacred being gives evidence of different kinds about his own creatures. 274. One is this, that _he_ himself is Aharman [^49]; (275) one is this, that he is himself the deluder of the creatures [^50]; (276) _and_, in the other, he makes his own creatures confederates involved with Aharman in deluding [^51]; so that _he implies:_ ‘There are _instances_ when I occasion _it, and_ there are _instances_ when Aharman _does_.’

277\. Through that _which_ he states, that mankind themselves occasion crime, they are made by him confederates with Aharman; _he_ himself _being_ at a distance from the crime. 278. For if mankind commit crime owing to their own nature and their own delusion, that _implies that_ the sacred being, with <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> Aharman, is far from the criminality, (279) because _it is_ as _it were_ not owing to the sacred being, nor yet owing to Aharman.

280\. Again, you should ask of those whom they call Mûtazalîk [^52] (281) thus: ‘Is _it_ the will of the sacred being _for_ all mankind to abstain from crime through _their own_ free will [^53], to escape from hell, _and_ to make _them_ proceed to heaven, or not?’ 282. If _one_ says that _it is_ not, (283) that _implies that_ an [^54] opinion is formed by him as to the little goodness of the sacred being _and_ the evil of his will; (284) _and_, for the same reason, _it_ is not fitting to glorify _him_ as the divine existence. 285. If _one_ says that _it is_ his will, (286) that _implies that_ an opinion is formed by him as to the good will of the sacred being; (287) _and_, for the same reason, _it_ is fitting to glorify _him_ as the divine existence.

288\. _Ask_ this, too, that is: ‘If _it be_ his will, is _he_ capable of performing _it_, or not?’ 289. If _one_ says that _he is_ not, (290) that _implies that_ an opinion is formed by him as to the incapability of the sacred being as regards that will of his; (291) _and_, for the same reason, _it_ is not fitting to glorify _him_ as the divine existence which is almighty. 292. If _one_ says that _he_ is capable of performing _his_ will, (293) that _implies that_ an opinion is formed by him as to _his_ <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> capability for that will of his; (294) _and_, for the same reason, _it_ is fitting to glorify _him_ as the divine existence which is almighty.

295\. Again, _ask_ this, that is: ‘When _he_ is capable of performing his will, does he perform _it_, or not?’ 296. If _one_ says that he performs _it_, (297) that _implies that_ the abstaining from sin, escaping from hell, and bringing to heaven [^55] would be manifested unto all mankind; (298) _but_ this is that which is not manifest by his existence, and is falsifying even his own revelation (dînŏ). 299. If _one_ says that _he_ is capable of performing his will, but does not perform _it_, (300) that _implies that_ an opinion is formed by him as to the unmercifulness of the sacred being, _his_ enmity to mankind, and the inconstancy of his will. 301. For if he performs _it, it_ is no harm to him himself and is an advantage _to_ mankind; his own will is also continuous thereby. 302. _But_ if he does not perform _it, it_ is no advantage to him himself and, is harm _to_ mankind; his own will is also discontinuous thereby.

303\. Again, _ask_ this, that is: ‘Does he not perform _it_ through will, or without will?’ 304. If _one_ says that he does not perform _it_ through will, (305) that _implies that_ an opinion is formed by him that the sacred being is good-willed, _but_ has no will to do good; (306) _and_ this is even to consider _him_ faulty through inconsistency. 307. If _one_ says that _he_ is without will, _and_ therefore does not perform _it_, (308) _that implies_ that an opinion is formed by him as to the weakness of the sacred being in his own self, or the existence of an injurer of his will.

309\. The conclusion is this, that, _with_ a manager <span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span> of this worldly _existence_ who may be without an opponent, without competition, and perfect in sagacity, goodness, and capability, _there_ should not be all these unworthy actions, trouble and misery, pain and vexation, especially of mankind and the other creatures. 310. Because, when a manager, without an opponent, is perfect in sagacity, he knows means for evil not to occur and also remedies for carrying off evil. 311. When _he_ is perfect in goodness and merciful, _he has_ no wish for the occurrence of evil at first, _but_ a wish for _its_ extinction. 312. When _he_ is perfect in capability, _he_ is capable of not really becoming equally the origin of evil.

313\. Now, as in the worldly _existence_, whose manager is the sacred being, the existence of evil is unquestionably visible, then thus much is not separable from this, either where the manager is _provided_ with an opponent, or is without an opponent:—314. If he does not know means for evil not to occur, and remedies for carrying off evil, the imperfect sagacity of the sacred being is thereby [^56] manifested. 315. Or the evil exists _with_ his good will, _and_ the imperfect goodness of his will is manifested. 316. Or _he_ is not capable of not _allowing_ the occurrence of evil, and of carrying _it_ off, _and_ the imperfect capability of the sacred being is manifested. 317. And when _he_ is imperfect even _in_ one—in sagacity, or goodness, or capability—_it_ is not fitting to glorify _and_ worship _him_ as the divine existence who is almighty, all-good, _and_ all-wise.

318\. This, too, you should know, that since any existing thing, which is acting, is _provided_ with a will, but _its_ nature _has_ not become unrestricted, (319) that <span id="p198"><sup><small>[ p. 198 ]</small></sup></span> _shows that_, if the original existence of the creator _be_ divinity, and his nature _be_ light _and_ beauty, fragrance and purity, goodness and sagacity, then such _things_ as darkness and ugliness, stench _and_ pollution, vileness _and_ ignorance—the demoniacal nature itself—ought to be far from him. 320. If his original existence _be_ anything demoniacal, and his nature _be_ darkness _or_ stench, ugliness _or_ pollution, vileness _or_ ignorance, then the nature of divinity remains strange to him.

321\. If there be _any_ one by whom indecision about all this is insinuated into his own self, that _implies that_, owing to his indecision about it, there is no discrimination _in_ him as to goodness, amid his own evil. 322. Now, moreover, the hope of the hopeful is absorbed, (323) for even he who goes to heaven through doing good works is, even there, in evil and misery, (324) because there is no distinct discrimination of good from evil, even there, (325) if there be the goodness which is devoid of evil, _and_ there be also the evil which is devoid of goodness, represented _as_ really of the same origin. 326. This is known, that the difference of good and evil is owing to difference of nature. 327. When the two origins of their difference and distinction from the other of different nature are manifest, that hope of the hopeful is just, (328) and sagacity is their passport (parvânak).

329\. This, too, you should know, that every statement which is not unconfused by its own limits is unenquiring (apa<i>d</i>\-khvâh) [^57]. 330. Likewise this, that the limit of divinity is specially sagacity. 331. _And_ also this, that [^58] the limit of sagacity is only [^59] <span id="p199"><sup><small>[ p. 199 ]</small></sup></span> advantageous action. 332. Advantageous action is not doing injury; (333) _and_ the modes of doing injury are three. 334. One is that which, _being_ no advantage to oneself, is the injury of another also. 335. \[One is that which, _being_ no advantage to another [^60]\], is the injury of oneself also. 336. _And_ one is that which is the injury of oneself and the injury of another also. 337. And from the creation of Aharman and the demons _there_ is no advantage _to_ a wisely-acting sacred being himself, _and there is_ injury of others also; (338) the non-advancement of even his own will, owing to his own work, is always manifested thereby.

339\. This, too, _you should know_, that if the will of the sacred being _be_ goodness, (340) his will is also eternal. 341. And he should be capable of a suitable will, (342) so that, from the beginning even to the end, all the goodness _and_ virtue of the will of the sacred being would have proceeded in the world. 343. Now _it_ is manifest that vileness and vice always proceed much more. 344. Therefore _the cause_ is one of these, either they always proceed through the will of the sacred being, or without _his_ will. 345. If they always proceed through some will of the sacred being, _it_ is evident that his will is also for vileness as well as for goodness, (346) or _he_ is inefficient and changeable in will. 347. Since a will does not change, unless owing to a cause, or unless owing to a changer, (348) that _implies_ one of these two, either _it_ is through some cause, or there exists some other _being with_ him as a changer of his will. 349 If they always proceed not through the will of the sacred being, (350) _from_ that _it_ is evident that the <span id="p200"><sup><small>[ p. 200 ]</small></sup></span> sacred being is suffering in his own will, and his will is not perfect, (351) or there exists some diminisher of it who is a possessor _of_ will.

352\. _As to_ this, too, which they assert, that the sacred being commanded Adam thus: ‘Thou shalt not eat of this one tree which is in paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t) [^61],’ (353) you should ask of them (354) thus: ‘Was the command which the sacred being gave to Adam, thus: “You shall not eat of this tree,” good or evil?’ 355. If the command were good _it_ is evident that the tree was evil; (356) _and_ it is not befitting the sacred being to create anything that is evil. 357. If the tree were good the command was evil, _and_ it is not befitting the sacred being to give an evil command. 358. If the tree were good, and the command as to not eating _were_ given by him, it is not [^62] adapted to the goodness and mercifulness of the sacred being to allot a benefit _away_ from his own innocent servants.

359\. _As to_ this, too, which they assert, that the sacred being brings every one whom he wills unto faith and the true way, and, as the recompense, he makes him proceed to the happy progress which is eternal; (360) _and_ him whom he does not will he leaves in irreligion and ignorance of the sacred being, and, for that reason, he casts him into hell and eternal misery [^63]; (361) you should ask of them (362) thus: ‘Is he good whose desire and will are for the religion and faith of the sacred being and the true way, or he whose desire and will are for going astray, irreligion, and ignorance of the sacred being?’ 363. If _one_ says that he is good whose desire and will <span id="p201"><sup><small>[ p. 201 ]</small></sup></span> are for the religion of the sacred being and the true way, (364) now _as to_ that man about whom this is the will of the sacred being, that he _shall_ leave him in irreligion, going astray, and ignorance of the sacred being, _and to whom_ an apostle, or _some_ other person who is a friend, recites the revelation (dînô) of the sacred being and the true way, (365) _does_ that _show that_ the sacred being is thereby better and more beneficial to him, or are that apostle _and_ that person _so?_ 366. If _one_ says that the will of the sacred being about him [^64] is good, it is thereby asserted by him, that not understanding the sacred being, not accepting the religion, and going astray are good; _but_ this is not acceptable \[and not to be taught [^65]\], on account of error. 367. If _one_ says that his coming to the true religion and understanding the sacred being are thereby better and more beneficial, (368) it is thereby obviously asserted by one that the apostle and person are thereby better to him than the sacred being. 369. Because a person _through_ whom the true way and an understanding of the sacred being are wanted among mankind, and his will is _bent_ upon it, is much better than he who is a sacred being (370) _by_ whose will backsliding (a<i>v</i>â<i>z</i>râsîh), misunderstanding, and irreligion _exist_ among them; _and_ the sacred being is much worse than that person.

371\. _Observe_ this, too, that if the criminal thought and criminal action of man are by the will of the sacred being, that already _implies_ that the sacred being produced criminal thought, and sowed crime <span id="p202"><sup><small>[ p. 202 ]</small></sup></span> in his mind, (372) and Aharman merely invites and instigates him to the committal of crime; that _shows that_ the criminal thought _traced to_ the sacred being and also his desire for it are more violent and worse than the invitation of Aharman. 373. When, too, his listening to _what proceeds_ from Aharman, _as to_ the committal of crime, is likewise due to the criminal thought which the sacred being produced, and _so_ also _is_ his desire for it, _it_ is already obvious that the sacred being is much worse and more sinful than Aharman.

374\. As regards these statements, which are enumerated by us, (375) one of these two _opinions_ must arise, (376) either that all are true or that all are false, (377) or there are _some_ which are true and there are _some_ which are false. 378. If all _be_ true, every statement that is not adapted to these statements is false, _or_ something _of_ the two, truth and falsehood. 379. If all _be_ false, every statement that is not adapted to these statements is true, _or_ something _of_ the two together [^66]. 380. If there be _some_ that are true and there be _some_ that are false, (381) then of those which are true—_derived_ from the nature and nucleus (nâf) of truth—(382) and of those which are false—_derived_ from the nature and nucleus and original evolution of falsehood—(383) the origins are two, one from which _arises_ truth, _and_ one _from_ which _arises_ falsehood.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (173:1) Pâz. ‘I have written.’

[^2]: (173:2) Sans. and JE insert ‘all.’

[^3]: (173:3) Most of this statement can be found in the Qur’ân in isolated texts, such as ‘God there is no god but he . . . He knows the unseen and the visible; the mighty, the wise . . . verily God is forgiving, compassionate . . . It is God who created you . . . and then will make you die.’ (Qur’ân LXIV, 13, 18, 14, XXX, 39; SBE. vol. ix.)

[^4]: (173:4) Assuming that Pâz. vîrô<i>s</i>aa (Sans. âmnâya) is a misreading of Pahl. virôyâk.

[^5]: (173:5) Tracing Pâz. awaga<i>d</i> (Sans. avâkirat) to Av. aiwi + gata.

[^6]: (174:1) So in Sanskrit; but, as the two Pâz. verbs end in -u<i>n</i>, the original Pahlavi termination may have been -yên (3d pers. optative). and we might read ‘which every one may, as it were, observe.’

[^7]: (175:1) K28 inserts shâya<i>d</i>, ‘_and_ possible,’ and JE inserts Pâz. tvã, which has the same meaning; but these insertions have probably originated in a blunder of the writer of AK, who first wrote Sans. <i>s</i>aknoti, the usual equivalent of Pâz. shâya<i>d</i>, but afterwards interlined Sans. sa<i>m</i>yu<i>g</i>yate to correspond with sa<i>z</i>e<i>d</i>, ‘it is expedient,’ the word he had written in the Pâz. text.

[^8]: (176:1) Assuming that Pâz. <i>k</i>i, ‘what?’ stands for <i>k</i>im. Sans. has ‘how?’ (Pâz. <i>k</i>u<i>n</i>.)

[^9]: (176:2) ‘Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day’ (Deut. xxix. 4).

[^10]: (177:1) Assuming that Pâz. khvazâr stands for khû<i>g</i>ârak; but, as Sans. has ‘injury,’ the Pâzand may be a misreading of â<i>z</i>âr.

[^11]: (177:2) Referring probably to the fall of man, detailed in §§ 61-77.

[^12]: (177:3) So in Sans. and JE, as in § 51; but AK and MH19 have ‘go’ here.

[^13]: (178:1) ‘And we did create man from crackling clay of black mud wrought in form. And the <i>g</i>inns had we created before of smokeless fire. And when thy lord said to the angels, “Verily I am creating a mortal from crackling clay of black mud wrought into shape; and when I have fashioned it, and breathed into it of my spirit, then fall ye down before it adoring.” And the angels adored all of them together, save Iblîs, who refused to be among those who adored. . . . He said, “Then get thee forth.” . . . Said he, “O my lord! respite me until the day when they shall be raised.” He said, “Then, verily, thou art of the respited.” . . . He said, “O my lord! for that thou hast seduced me I will surely make it seem seemly for them on earth, and I will surely seduce them all together, save such of thy servants amongst them as are sincere.”’ (Qur’ân XV, 26-40; SBE, vol. vi.)

[^14]: (179:1) ‘And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it ”’ (Gen. ii. 15-17).

[^15]: (179:2) ‘Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made’ (Gen. iii. 1).

[^16]: (179:3) ‘That old serpent, called the Devil and Satan’ (Rev. xii. 9, xx. 2).

[^17]: (179:4) Compare Gen. iii. 1-6.

[^18]: (179:5) ‘And the eyes of them both were opened’ (Gen. iii. 7):

[^19]: (179:6) ‘Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man’ (Gen. iii. 23, 24).

[^20]: (180:1) 'For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake; because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people . . . but I (Samuel) will teach you the good and the right way' (1 Sam. xii. 22, 23).

[^21]: (180:2) ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute’ (Luke xi. 49).

[^22]: (181:1) The will of the adversary is probably meant (see § 95).

[^23]: (181:2) So in Sans. and JE, but AK has ‘so that.’

[^24]: (182:1) That is, why is the sinner punished while the adversary, who occasions the sin, remains unmolested and triumphant?

[^25]: (182:2) AK has ‘let’ written above ‘admitted.’

[^26]: (183:1) Pâz. khôr, which Nêr. seems to have identified with Pers. kar, as his Sans. gives ‘deaf.’ It may, however, mean ‘blind’ (Pers. kûr), as in Chap. XII, 64, 70.

[^27]: (183:2) The Sanskrit takes Pâz. dastûr in its more usual sense of ‘high-priest.’

[^28]: (184:1) Sans. has ‘the will of the sacred being _being_ powerful and eternal.’

[^29]: (184:2) Without whose will and command the sin and evil cannot arise, as assumed in § 125.

[^30]: (184:3) The sick are probably meant, but the original text is ambiguous.

[^31]: (184:4) Assuming that Pâz. hugâre<i>n</i>d stands for Pahl. aûkâlend.

[^32]: (185:1) Probably the poor, but the original text is ambiguous.

[^33]: (185:2) Assuming that Pâz. <i>g</i>âmine<i>d</i> stands for Pahl. gâmînê<i>d</i>. The old MS. AK ends with this section, and the remaining half of the extant text has been found only in modern copies, having been formerly separated from AK and lost

[^34]: (185:3) So in JE, but JJ has ‘nobility,’ and MH19 has ‘pleasure.’

[^35]: (185:4) JJ has ‘nobility.’

[^36]: (186:1) Assuming that Pâz. ham<i>e</i>khtaa stands for Pahl. âmîkhtak.

[^37]: (186:2) Compare Chap. VIII, 108-116.

[^38]: (186:3) That is, ‘instinctively.’

[^39]: (188:1) So in MH19 and Sans., but JE omits ‘that.’

[^40]: (189:1) Compare Rom. ix. 20, 21: ‘Shall the thing formed say to him that formed _it_, “Why hast thou made me thus?” Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?’

[^41]: (189:2) See Chap. X, 53.

[^42]: (190:1) Assuming that Pâz. apa<i>d</i>vâh stands for Pahl. apatûgîh; the two words being nearly alike in Pahlavi letters.

[^43]: (190:2) Reading â<i>v</i>â<i>d</i>îh-kar instead of Pâz. â<i>z</i>âdîgar, ‘producing freedom, or nobility,’ which two words are alike in Pahlavi writing.

[^44]: (191:1) The word a<i>v</i>ê<i>z</i>ak, ‘pure,’ is here used idiomatically for ‘mere,’ precisely as ‘pure’ is often used in English.

[^45]: (192:1) Literally ‘with averted head.’

[^46]: (192:2) Probably referring to the Qur’ân XV, 26-40 (see § 59 n).

[^47]: (193:1) Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

[^48]: (194:1) Texts to this effect are numerous in the Qur’ân, such as ‘whom he pleases does God lead astray, and whom he pleases he places on the right way . . . God leads the wrong-doers astray; for God does what he will . . . in hell they shall broil’ (Qur’ân VI, 39, XIV, 32, 34; SBE, vol. vi).

[^49]: (194:2) As deduced from the passage quoted in § 269.

[^50]: (194:3) As stated in the passage quoted in § 272.

[^51]: (194:4) As implied in the passage quoted in § 272.

[^52]: (195:1) Which is doubtless the original Pahlavi form of Pâz. muthzarî. It is an adjective, meaning ‘seceding, schismatic,’ derived from Ar. mu’htazil, and applied specially to Muhammadan schismatics.

[^53]: (195:2) Assuming that Pâz. âwâ<i>d</i>\-kâmî stands for Pahl. a<i>z</i>â<i>d</i>\-kâmîh, which would be identical with the former word in Pahlavi writing.

[^54]: (195:3) JE has ‘no’ in Pâz. but not in Sans., which negative is evidently a modern blunder.

[^55]: (196:1) JJ has ‘saving from hell _and_ escaping to heaven.’

[^56]: (197:1) Reading a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i> instead of the similarly-written afa<i>s</i>, ‘and by it.’

[^57]: (198:1) Sans. has ‘undesirable.’

[^58]: (198:2) JJ and Sans. omit these four words.

[^59]: (198:3) Literally ‘one.’

[^60]: (199:1) The words in brackets are omitted, both in Pâz. and Sans., by JE and JJ, the only two MSS. available.

[^61]: (200:1) See § 64.

[^62]: (200:2) Reading Pâz. n<i>e</i> instead of Pâz. b<i>e</i>, ‘quite,’ as the Sanskrit has a negative participle.

[^63]: (200:3) See § 271.

[^64]: (201:1) The man mentioned in § 364.

[^65]: (201:2) The words in brackets have no equivalent in the Pâzand text, but are indicated by âsvâdya<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a in Sans.

[^66]: (202:1) Sans. has ‘something mingled twofold.’
