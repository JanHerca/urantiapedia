## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER LX.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘Of mankind which are more conversant with good and evil?’

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Of mankind _he_ whose sojourn [^1] and business are with the bad [^2], and they provide him a name for good repute and goodness, is the man more conversant with good. 5. And he whose sojourn and business are with the good [^3], and they provide him a name for disrepute, is the man more conversant with evil.

6\. ‘Because it is said, (7, 8) that whoever joins with the good brings good with _him_, and whoever <span id="p107"><sup><small>[ p. 107 ]</small></sup></span> joins with the bad _brings_ [^4] evil—(9) just like the wind which, when it impinges on stench, is [^5] stench, (10) and when it impinges on perfume, is perfume,—(11) _it_ is, therefore, notorious [^6], (12) that he whose business is with the good receives good, (13) and _he_ whose business is with the bad _receives_ [^7] evil; (14) but, even then, both are to be considered as an experiment (aû<i>z</i>mâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) [^8].’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (106:3) Reading ni<i>s</i>astŏ. L19 has ‘whose business is most (vê<i>s</i>\-ast),’ both here and in § 5.

[^2]: (106:4) L19 has ‘the good.’

[^3]: (106:5) L19 has ‘the bad.’

[^4]: (107:1) L19 has ‘will bring with _him_’ in both clauses, but the repetition is unnecessary in Pahlavi.

[^5]: (107:2) L19 has ‘will bring with _it_,’ both here and in § 10.

[^6]: (107:3) L19 has ‘proper to know.’

[^7]: (107:4) K43 does not repeat this verb.

[^8]: (107:5) L19 has ‘by the result (a<i>n</i><i>z</i>âme<i>s</i>n).’ The meaning is that, though a man's character is generally in accordance with the company he keeps, this must not be assumed without proof; and when the contrary is the case, as stated in §§ 4, 5, his own disposition must be of a very decided nature. Nêryôsang seems to have misunderstood the author's argument, and, supposing §§ 6-13 to contain a mere illustration of §§ 4, 5, he considered it necessary to transpose ‘the bad’ and ‘the good’ in §§ 4, 5, so as to make the illustration applicable.
