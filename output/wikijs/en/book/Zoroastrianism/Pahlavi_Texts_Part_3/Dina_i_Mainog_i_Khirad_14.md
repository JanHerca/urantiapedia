## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER XIV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of [^1] \[wisdom (2) thus: ‘Which protection is the more defensive? 3. Which friend [^2] (4) and which supporter of fame are good? 5. Which helper of enjoyment is good? 6. Which wealth is the pleasanter? 7. And which is the supremest pleasure of all pleasures [^3]?’

8\. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: ‘The sacred being is the more defensive protection. 10. A virtuous brother is a good friend. 11. A child, who is virtuous and an upholder of religion, is a good supporter of fame. 12. A virtuous wife, who is well-disposed, is a good helper of enjoyment. 13. That wealth is better and pleasanter which is collected by honesty, _and one_ consumes _and_ maintains with duties and good works. 14. _And_ the pleasures which are superior to all pleasures are health of body, freedom from fear, good repute, _and_ righteousness [^4].’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (41:1) From this point to Chap. XXVII, 49 the Pahlavi text of K43 is missing, owing to the loss of nine folios in that MS., but a copy of the missing passage, made by Dastur Hoshangji Jamaspji from TD2, has been consulted for the purpose of controlling the Pâz. version of L19.

[^2]: (41:2) L19 inserts ‘is good?’

[^3]: (41:3) TD2 has ‘which is the friend who is the supremest of friends;’ but this does not correspond well with the reply in § 14.

[^4]: (41:4) TD2 adds ‘_and_ are good.’
