## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXV.

1\. The twenty-fifth subject is this, that any agreement and promise (qaûl) they make with any one it is necessary so far to perform and bring to pass. 2. Although many things _may_ go [^1] to harm by means (sabab) of it, it is not desirable to perform that agreement with duplicity.

3\. Because, in our religion, they call this a Mihir-dru<i>g</i> (‘breach of promise’), _and_ in revelation it decrees, _as to_ any one _who_ commits a Mihir-dru<i>g</i>, that the way _to_ heaven becomes closed for him, and that person himself goes discomforted out of this world, so that a warning (’halâmat) becomes quite manifest unto him.

4\. And a Mihir-dru<i>g</i> is attached [^2] _in_ such a manner that, _if_ fortune (<i>t</i>âli’h) may have befallen any one [^3] <span id="p288"><sup><small>[ p. 288 ]</small></sup></span> happily, or an insufficient quantity of his life (’humr) may have remained, the Mihir-dru<i>g</i> extends to his children without opposition (‘<i>h</i>ilâf). 5. And every household that becomes extinct, or race whose issue fails, or _any of_ the great misfortunes that happen to mankind—from which misfortune _one_ obtains release with difficulty—may all be owing to the _fact_ that they have committed a Mihir-dru<i>g</i>.

6\. If _committed by_ oneself, it is declared, _in_ one place in revelation, that the glorified Zaratu<i>s</i>t, the Spitamân, enquired of Hôrmazd, the good _and_ propitious, thus: ‘Of any of the sins that mankind commit which is the worst?’ 7. Hôrmazd, the good _and_ propitious, decreed thus: ‘No sin whatever is worse than this, that two persons make a covenant with one another _in_ such a manner that no one whatever is between them, except me who am Hôrmazd; _and_, afterwards one of those two persons deviates _from it_, and says, "I have no knowledge (‘<i>h</i>abar) _of it_," and no one whatever is a witness, for that _other_ person, except me.’ 8. No sin whatever is worse than that, and that person himself _will_ not go out of this world until retribution overtakes him, and in that _other_ world his punishment is more severe than all; _so_ that person becomes unfortunate _in_ both worlds. 9. And it is the same _if_ this covenant _be_ with a righteous _person or_ a wicked _one_.
