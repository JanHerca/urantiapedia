## SAD DAR. CHAPTER III.

1\. The third subject is this, that it is necessary _for_ man that he be continuously employed (ma<i>s</i>_gh_ûl) on his own work, and then the work becomes his own.

2\. For it is declared in revelation, that every one who hereafter becomes employed [^2] _on_ his own work, if in the midst of that work any trouble and discomfort happen to him, obtains in that _other_ world twelve recompenses [^3] for every single _instance_. 3. If he becomes employed _on_ iniquity (fasâd), and in the midst of that work any trouble and harm happen to him, he so [^4] obtains in that _other_ world only torment (’huqûbat) and punishment.

4\. Similarly (maTHalâ<i>m</i>), if any one be himself going, employed on his own work, and a robber falls <span id="p260"><sup><small>[ p. 260 ]</small></sup></span> upon him on the road, and carries off his property (qumâ<i>s</i>), or he be slain [^1], they give him back in that _other_ world four _things_ for each one [^2] of whatever they have carried off. 5. If he be slain he becomes righteous, any sin that he has committed goes clean _away_ from him, _and_ they convey him to heaven. 6. But (ammâ) if he becomes faulty (bâ<i>t</i>il) in any duty, and a robber falls upon him on the road [^3], and carries off his wealth (mâl), or he be slain, when he descends to that _other_ world [^4] all the property that _other_ carried off from him becomes just as _though it were_ his who has carried it off from that person [^5]; and, besides, _there_ occur, as a substitute (’hivaʓ̣) _for_ that property, the punishment and torment they give him. 7. _And_ if he be slain it is just as _though_ he who has carried it off from that person _were one_ who had innocently slain that person who arrives in hell as retribution (mukâfât) for sin.
