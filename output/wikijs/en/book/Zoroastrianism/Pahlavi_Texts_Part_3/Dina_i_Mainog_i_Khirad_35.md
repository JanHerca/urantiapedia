## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER XXXV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: How many are those people whom it is necessary to consider as rich, and how many are those who are poor?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'These are the people it is necessary to consider as rich:—(5) one is he who is perfect in wisdom; (6) the second, whose body is healthy, and he lives fearlessly; (7) the third, who is content with that which has come; (8) the fourth, he whose destiny is a helper in virtue; (9) the fifth, who is well-famed in the eyes of the sacred beings, and _by_ the tongues of the good; (10) the sixth, whose trust is on this one, pure, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers; (11) _and_ the seventh, whose wealth is from honesty.

12\. ‘And these are the people to be considered as poor:—(13) one is he _with_ whom there is no wisdom; (14) the second, whose body is not healthy; (15) the third, who lives in his fear, terror [^2], and falsehood; (16) the fourth, who is not ruling in his <span id="p71"><sup><small>[ p. 71 ]</small></sup></span> own body; (17) the fifth, whose destiny is no helper; (18) the sixth, who is infamous in the eyes of the sacred beings, and _on_ the tongues of the good; (19) _and_ the seventh, who is old, _and_ no child and kindred exist.’
