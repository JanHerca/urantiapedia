## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER XII.

1\. Again, about the inconsistency of their assertions _there_ are several statements from the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> [^1] <span id="p203"><sup><small>[ p. 203 ]</small></sup></span> manuscript, (2) _as to_ that which they say, that the sacred being is around everything, _but_ nothing is within him; (3) and within everything, _but_ nothing is around him. 4. _That he_ is above everything, _but_ nothing is below him; (5) and below everything, _but_ nothing is above him. 6. _That_ he sits upon a throne, _but_ is possessing no _resting-_place; (7) and is inside heaven, _but_ is possessing no whereabouts. 8. _That_ he does not exist in any place, and _yet_ he does exist _there_. 9. _That_ he exists everywhere, and _yet_ his place does not exist. 10. Also _that_ everything of his becomes _fit_ for his own by his own will, (11) _his_ original evolution _being both_ malice and good; (12) and _he is_ eternally unforgiving and compassionate, (13) preparing distress and not distressing. 14. Likewise _that_ he _has_ commanded him who is incapable of performing _or_ neglecting the divine command, (15) and he _has_ created him who is innocent for hell, not the distresser. 16. _That he is_ aware of the hellish existence of mankind, owing to wickedness, and his will is for it; (17) and _he is_ good-willed, or it _has_ become not his will. 18. _That_ he _has_ produced a remedy, and is not himself distressing; (19) or no remedy, but want of remedy, is produced by him, _and yet he is_ not possessing an opponent. 20. _That he is_ wanting experience, and _yet_ omniscient; (21) neglecting commands, and _yet_ <span id="p204"><sup><small>[ p. 204 ]</small></sup></span> _they are_ themselves his will; (22) and he who neglects, _and_ provides a restricted evolution [^2], is _yet_ a good sovereign. 23. Also _that_ his commands are all continuous, (24) and _yet_ the setting aside of his commands is obtainable. 25. And _that_ there is _some_ of his will which is not continuous, (26) and neglect of his will is not an injurer of the will. 27. Likewise _that_ he _has_ commanded that which is not his will, (28) and the command _which is_ not inconsistent with his will _and_ also the command _which is_ inconsistent with his will are both proper. 29. Also _that_ his good will is not a discontinuous will, (30) and _as to_ his evil will, which makes evil things, that is judicious. 31. And many other inconsistencies which are in the assertions of _various_ sects.

32\. If it be not possible for an orderly (pa<i>d</i>mânîk) religion to exist, without rescue from these inconsistent assertions of many kinds, (33) they then [^3] say this of it, that _to_ the supposers of two original evolutions [^4] the work of the sacred being is weak and unresisting; (34) _and_ they say _it_ is not as _it were_ adapted to the grandeur of the sacred being.

35\. Upon this subject, too, there are _some matters_, which I _shall_ clearly state, _that_ should be dictated _and_ known. 36. That is, does he [^5] make divine things weaker and more unresisting, (37) where _it is he_ who says that _the sacred being's_ own achievements, <span id="p205"><sup><small>[ p. 205 ]</small></sup></span> which _were_ created by him, have all lapsed into _being_ intolerant of command _and_ deaf to admonition, (38) till even the most tender-bodied creatures struggle against his will? 39. And so _they have_ slain _or_ impaled those many prophets (vakhshvarân) _and_ apostles (pêtkhambarân) of his, who are appointed by him; (40) _and_ there are _some_ who _have_ acted scornfully, contemptibly, and irreverently. 41. This, too, is where _he has_ not only not protected his own dominion from the vile _creatures_ which _were_ created by him himself, but _he has_ himself afflicted his own dominion also; (42) and he himself destroys his own productions without a reason, (43) and himself renders his own creations useless. 44. Through his own culpability he himself destroys his own innocent servants. 45. He himself makes his own peculiar friends weak, needy, sinful, and deluded. 46. And _his_ wrath, _inflicted_ upon a single innocent servant, which is like Aharman's [^6], makes his own innumerable creatures unobservant _and_ deluded. 47. For a sin that is limited, which is owing to his own actions, he puts the innocent to unlimited punishment [^7]. 48. The door of forgiveness is finally shut up, (49) and he is not satiated with the pain, distress, and misery of his own creatures, (50) _but_ maintains _them_ perpetually in action and excitement. 51. And _yet_ he is not able to insist upon the commands which he <span id="p206"><sup><small>[ p. 206 ]</small></sup></span> gives _in_ the beginning, middle, _or_ end. 52. Or is _it_ he [^8] who says that that _one_ is the sacred being who is perpetually a ruler, all-knowing and almighty; (53) whose dominion and knowledge and power are perpetual _and_ for unlimited time? 54. Owing to him, too, is the happiness of any goodness; (55) his actions also are for a purpose, _his_ commands are advantageous, (56) _he is_ compassionate and forgiving as regards his own servants, (57) and is an abundant bestower of recompense, too, _on_ that servant who is a carrier _off_ of victory. 58. As to him who is a sinner, who, on account of his own sinfulness, becomes captive _in_ the hands of the enemy [^9], _he is_ forgiving upon atonement _for_ the sinfulness and cleansing from iniquity and pollution. 59. _In_ the end _he_ is no leaver of any good creature captive in the hands of enemies [^10], (60) and is heir protector, maintainer, and cherisher, in body and life, amid _their_ contest and struggle with enemies. 61. _He is_ a complete defender of his own empire from opponents of a different nature, (62) and his champions and troops become victorious in the struggle and contest. 63. _And_ in the end _he is_ a bringer of victory _to_ his own creatures, as regards every iniquity.

64\. When it is observed _as_ to light, knowledge, sight, life, health, _and_ other divine creations, that _they_ are fully resistant and prevailing over darkness, <span id="p207"><sup><small>[ p. 207 ]</small></sup></span> ignorance, blindness, death, sickness, _and_ other demoniacal peculiarities—(65) because this is known, that light is the putting aside of all darkness, (66) knowledge is victorious over ignorance, (67) and life is powerful [^11] and increasing over death, (68) for, owing to the powerfulness and increase of life, the incalculable progress of the creatures arises from two persons, (69) and multitudes are confident about it; (70) so also sight and health are manifestly as much victorious and powerful over blindness and sickness —(71) _such being observed_, it is also expedient to observe this, that is, what does the opposing fiend want, _and_ about what do the troops of the sacred being struggle?

72\. That opponent wants this _that he speaks of_ thus: ‘I _will_ make this earth and sky and the creatures which are luminaries [^12] extinct, (73) or I _will_ bring _them_ into _my_ possession, _and will_ pervert _them_ from their own nature [^13], (74) so that the sacred being shall not be able to occasion the resurrection and the renovation _of the universe_, and to restore his own creatures.’

75\. The troops of the sacred being struggle about this, that the opponent shall not attain to _his_ will through _his_ desire. 76. _Observe_ this, too, that the troops of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _have been_ valiant in struggling and successful in will _ever_ since the original creation.

77\. From this _it_ is manifest, when it happens _that_ this earth and sky are formed, (78) that it _would be_ possible for him to make all creatures and creations extinct; but _he_ is incapable of making even one of the most tender-bodied creatures of the sacred being <span id="p208"><sup><small>[ p. 208 ]</small></sup></span> extinct. 79. Because, if even, by reason of death, the body be separated from life, _it_ is not extinction and change of nature from its own self, but decay [^14] of peculiarities and a necessity of _going_ from place to place, from duty to duty [^15]. 80. Then each one of the qualities of one's body _and_ life is to subsist again, in its own nature, for other duties, as is revealed. 81. And the existence of these creatures and creation, fully continuously _and_ perpetually active, is advantageously manifest during a suitable period.

82\. Thus far is considered complete upon this subject.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (202:2) See Chap. IV, 407. As the inconsistent statements which p. 203 follow in the text are not to be found in the portion of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> known to be extant, they were probably contained in the first two books of that work, which have not yet been discovered. Chap. 132 of the third book (130 in Dastûr Peshotan's translation, pp. 176-178) is the nearest approach to our text in style, but not in matter. It is ‘about him who is in all _and_ over all, over and not lower than anything _nor_ through anything, that is, even owing to management _he is_ over all, and all is manageable by him.’

[^2]: (204:1) Reading bandak-ga<i>s</i>tîh instead of Pâz. ba<i>n</i>daya<i>s</i>tî; compare Chap. IV, 73 n.

[^3]: (204:2) Reading adîna<i>s</i>, ‘then of it,’ for Pâz. ainâ, as in Chap. IV, 81.

[^4]: (204:3) That is, those who hold the orthodox Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper's opinion, that the producer of evil is independent of the producer of good, so long as the former continues to exist.

[^5]: (204:4) The believer in a single original evolution without any independent producer of evil. Connect §§ 36, 37 with §§ 52, 53.

[^6]: (205:1) Aharman being supposed to be the producer of the demon of wrath, who is one of his most powerful auxiliaries.

[^7]: (205:2) Sans. has ‘he puts another unlimited punishment upon the innocent;’ Nêr. having read hanŏ, ‘another,’ instead of avŏ, ‘to,’ which two words are written alike in Pahlavi. As the author's interpretation of his opponent's argument assumes that everything, including sin, is produced by the sacred being, he naturally concludes that the sinners themselves are innocent.

[^8]: (206:1) The believer in two original evolutions, good and evil; the producer of the latter being independent of the producer of the former for a limited period of existence. This producer of evil is not clearly described here, but is mentioned in §§ 58-61, 72 as an enemy and opponent. §§ 52, 53 are to be read in connection with §§ 36-38.

[^9]: (206:2) The spiritual enemy, Aharman.

[^10]: (206:3) Compare Chap. IV, 100.

[^11]: (207:1) Assuming that Pâz. ava<i>z</i>ma<i>n</i>d stands for Pahl. ao<i>g</i>\-hômand.

[^12]: (207:2) Sans. has ‘of the luminaries.’

[^13]: (207:3) Compare Bd. I, 14.

[^14]: (208:1) Assuming that Pâz. nyâra<i>s</i>ni is a misreading of Pahl. nihâri<i>s</i>nŏ.

[^15]: (208:2) Compare Chap. IV, 87.
