## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XCIII.

1\. The ninety-third subject is this, that it is necessary for all those of the good religion to practise abstinence from uttering slander (_gh_aîbat) behind _one's_ back [^2].

2\. In the commentary of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> it states, that [^3] slander is the greatest of all sins. 3. Every one who perpetrates slander _about_ any one is like him who has eaten dead matter—and the eating of dead matter is a sin [^4] _that_ has likewise been mentioned, before this, in this book [^5]—but the statement is like this, while they do not indicate _any_ punishment for it in this world [^6], it does not go _without it_ in that _other_ world. 4. Therefore it is necessary for those of the good religion to make an effort, so that they _may_ guard themselves from this slander.

5\. In order that they _may_ show thy soul, _when_ [^7] resigning life, the satisfaction (i<i>g</i>zâ) for the sin, it <span id="p357"><sup><small>[ p. 357 ]</small></sup></span> states, in the commentary of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i>, _as to_ any one by whom slander is perpetrated, if _the injured person_ goes before him _and_ begs a righteous gift from him, and he provides a righteous gift for that _person_, the sin departs from him.
