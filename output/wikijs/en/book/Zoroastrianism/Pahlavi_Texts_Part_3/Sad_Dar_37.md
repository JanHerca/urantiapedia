## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXXVII.

1\. The thirty-seventh subject is this, that, when _the days of_ the guardian spirits [^1] come on, it is necessary that all persons, among their own food and devotion, _should_ order _and_ provide the sacred cakes and ceremonial, the sacred feast and benedictions (âfrîngân). 2. _For_ these ten days it is incumbent on every one; _and_ those are better which they prepare in their own houses, because the souls [^2] go every one to its own house. 3. And they _should_ have an ear for them [^3], so that they _may_ prepare the sacred cakes and feast and benedictions.

4\. Those ten days any one of all the souls—_that_ are in this _way_ [^4] in every house where they provide the feast more abundantly—proclaims, as to that master of the house [^5], that family, and the whole who are in that house, and the year's affairs of every kind, _that_ they are very good, and their entry (da‘<i>h</i>l) and coming in are very good. 5. And every single <span id="p299"><sup><small>[ p. 299 ]</small></sup></span> good work, on account of which we have spoken of the souls of the departed, becomes just like those we have done for our own souls. 6. And, when they pass away from this worldly _existence_, those souls come again, meeting them, and cause gladness, maintain [^6] their courage, and also render _them_ honour in the presence of the creator Hôrmazd, and speak _thus:_ ‘_These_ righteous souls did not put us away from remembrance while they were in the world, _and_ we have been satisfied with them; now we are unanimous that thou _shouldest_ provide them equal shares of those good works of ours, _and_ make their souls attain to the position of the righteous.’ 7. They utter these words, and give those souls confidence, while they make out their account. 8. Afterwards, with them, they make the passage of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, till they arrive at their own position, _and_ then they return.

9\. Therefore it is necessary to make an effort, so that they _may_ maintain the guardian spirits properly, and the souls of _their_ fathers and mothers and relations _may_ exist with honour from them. 10. For if they retire with dissatisfaction they utter a curse, _and_, as the soul departs from this world, they administer reproaches to it, and speak _thus:_ ‘Thou thinkest that they wish continually to make a way [^7] for thee _to_ that place, _but_ it is not necessary for thee to come into this world [^8]. 11. Now, hadst thou performed duty _and_ good works on our behalf, and hadst thou recollected us, we would also have come to thy assistance, and would have released thee from <span id="p300"><sup><small>[ p. 300 ]</small></sup></span> this fearful position.’ 12. And that _soul_ experiences much repentance, and has no advantage whatever _from it_.
