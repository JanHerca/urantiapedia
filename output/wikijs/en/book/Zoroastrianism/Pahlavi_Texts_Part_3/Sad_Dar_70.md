## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXX.

1\. The seventieth subject is this, that, _as to_ any persons, when they carry a corpse to the appointed place, it is necessary that two suits of clothes be put on, on account of this work. 2. It is requisite _for_ those clothes to be on [^1], and it is necessary [^2] to make a dog gaze at the corpse twice, once _at_ the time when life becomes separated _from_ it, and once _at_ the time when they wish to take _it_ up.

3\. Then it is necessary that both those persons be connected, _and each of them is_ to tie a cord on one of his own hands, so that the hand _may_ go away [^3] from _that of_ the other one. 4. And, when they are moving, it is necessary for him to be prepared and not to speak a word with any one. 5. And if it be a pregnant woman _they are_ to take _her_ up by four persons, because there are two corpses [^4].

6\. When, avoiding dead matter, _one_ comes again upon it, _he has_, in the end, to wash [^5] with _ceremonial_ ablution [^6], and that is requisite for the reason that he <span id="p336"><sup><small>[ p. 336 ]</small></sup></span> may not thereby be rapidly a _cause of_ wickedness or death for any one [^7].

7\. And if _one_ does not show a dog to the corpse, _and_ they take _it_ up, how many soever _there_ be, the whole _of them_ become polluted [^8]. 8. In the commentary of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> it is asserted, that every one who takes up a corpse that a dog _has_ not seen is polluted and worthy of death [^9], and never becomes clean; his soul _also_ would be wicked.
