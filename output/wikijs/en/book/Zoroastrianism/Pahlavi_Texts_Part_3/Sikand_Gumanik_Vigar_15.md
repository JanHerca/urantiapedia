## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER XV.

1\. Another _thing_ I publish is a feeble story (nisang) about the inconsistency, unbounded statements, and incoherent disputations of Christian (Tarsâk) believers.

2\. Since, inasmuch as all three [^1] are from the one origin of Judaism—(3) that _implying that_, when _anything_ is said within the one, it is for them mutually helping their own delusion of every kind—(4) you should know whence the original sect of Christianity came forth. 5. That in the town of Jerusalem [^2] _there_ was a woman of the same Jews who was known for incapacity [^3], (6) _and_ pregnancy became manifest in her [^4]. 7. When asked by them thus: ‘Whence is this pregnancy of thine?’ (8) she said in reply thus: ‘The angel Gabriel [^5] came unto me, and he spoke thus: “Thou art pregnant by the pure wind (holy spirit) [^6].”’ <span id="p230"><sup><small>[ p. 230 ]</small></sup></span> 9\. _As to_ that, you should observe thus: ‘Who, apart from that woman, saw the angel Gabriel? _And_ on what account is it expedient to consider that woman truthful?’ 10. If they say that, on account of the spiritual state of that angel, no one is able to see _him_, (11) that _implies_—if the cause of not seeing that angel be _his_ spiritual nature—_that_ the sight of that woman also, for the same reason, is not unrestricted. 12. If they say that the sacred being made _him_ visible to that woman, and on account of the worthiness of that woman, (13) no other person _being_ made worthy, (14) _observe_ this, where is the evidence that the woman spoke truthfully? 15. Or, if that woman were conspicuous to _any_ one for truth, it is fitting for him to demonstrate that also to other persons, so that, through that evidence, she might be more fully considered as very truthful by them. 16. _But_ now the showing of him (the angel), to that woman only; is not considered _by_ any one as true. 17. Now you should also observe _that_ the origin of their religion _has_ all come forth from this testimony of a woman, which _was_ given by her about her own _condition_.

18\. Observe, again, that if they say the Messiah arose from the pure wind of the sacred being, that _implies_—if the only wind that is pure _and_ from the sacred being be that one—that the other wind, which is distinct from that, is not _from_ the sacred being and not pure, (19) _and_ another producer is manifested inevitably. 20. If the wind be all from <span id="p231"><sup><small>[ p. 231 ]</small></sup></span> the sacred being and sacred, it ought to be all pure. 21. If only that one wind be pure, the other wind is polluted and not sacred. 22. As there is no producer whatever except the sacred being, that pollution and impurity of the other wind are likewise from the sacred. being. 23. And if the other wind be that of the sacred being and sacred, it ought to be all pure. 24. Now, that one _being_ considered as purity, why was the other polluted?

25\. Again, _observe_ this, that, if the Messiah were the son of the sacred being for the reason that the sacred being is the father of all, through productiveness, creativeness, and cherishing, (26) that Messiah, through sonship to the sacred being, is not otherwise than the meaner creatures which the sacred being produced and created. 27. If he were born through the means of male and female, (28) that _implies_—if birth through male and female be suitable unto the sacred being—_that_ it is also _so_ unto the archangels _and_ spirits; _in_ like manner, on account of the existence of birth [^7], the occurrence of death also is suitable. 29. Thus, about the arising of _that_ same sacred being _there_ is no doubt, (30) because there where birth of that kind _exists_, eating, drinking, _and_ even death are certain.

31\. And, there are _some_ even who say that the Messiah is the sacred being himself. 32. Now this is very strange, when the mighty sacred being, the maintainer _and_ cherisher of the two existences, became of human nature, _and_ went into the womb of a woman who _was_ a Jew. 33. To leave the lordly throne, the sky _and_ earth, the _celestial_ sphere <span id="p232"><sup><small>[ p. 232 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ other similar _objects_ of _his_ management and protection, he fell (aûpast), for concealment, into a polluted and straitened [^8] place, (34) and, finally, delivered his own body to scourging, execution on the tree (dâr-kar<i>d</i>îh), and the hands of enemies, (35) while, apart from death, much brutality _and_ lawlessness _were_ arranged by them.

36\. If they speak of his _having_ been inside the womb of a woman for the reason that the sacred being exists _in_ every place, (37) that _implies that being_ inside the womb of a woman, through existence _in_ every place, is not more antagonistic than _being in any_ very polluted and very fetid place; (38) _and, along_ with that, that the faultiness of speaking of all places _as having_ been the property of the sacred being is manifold, (39) because, if _they were so, in_ like manner the speaking of anything whatever that is devoid of the existence of the sacred being is strange [^9].

40\. Again, _as to_ that which they say, that death and execution on the tree _were_ accepted by him, as a yoke [^10], for the sake of demonstrating the resurrection to mankind, (41) that _implies_—if it were not possible for him to demonstrate the resurrection to mankind, except through that disgrace [^11] and death and brutal treatment of himself—_that_ that omnipotence of his is not effectual. 42. Or, when no opponent and adversary whatever of his arose, why <span id="p233"><sup><small>[ p. 233 ]</small></sup></span> are they not made without doubt of that sort of clear knowledge which is _imparted_ by seeing the resurrection, so that _there_ would not have been a necessity for this mode of demonstrating it brutally, disgracefully [^12], distressingly, _and_ through the will of _his_ enemies. 43. If that death _were_ accepted by him; as a yoke of a new description, through his own will, (44) that _implies that_ now his outcry of woe and curses for the executioners [^13], _and his_ considering those Jews as _it were_ wrathfully are unreasonable. 45. _He ought_, indeed, not to cause curses and _imprecations of_ woe upon them, but it is fitting for them to be worthy of recompense through that deed.

46\. Again, _as to_ this which they state, that the father and son and pure wind are three names which are not separate one from the other [^14], (47) nor is one foremost, (48) _and_ this, too, that, though a son, _he_ is not less than the father, _but in_ every knowledge equal _to_ the father [^15], why now is _one_ to call him by a different name? 49. If it be proper _for_ three to be one, that _implies that_ it is certainly possible _for_ three to be nine and _for_ nine to be <span id="p234"><sup><small>[ p. 234 ]</small></sup></span> three; (50) _and_ it is possible to speak _of_ other numbers, in this sequence, unlimitedly.

51\. _Observe_ this, too, that if a son _be_ not less than a father, that father also is not greater than the son. 52. That is possible if the father is said _to be_ from the son, or the son not from the father. 53. And this is certain, that it is possible _for_ every one _originating_ from _any_ one to be less than him from [^16] whom he is, who is the essential origin [^17] of himself; (54) if _he be so_ in _point of_ time, _and_ likewise if _so_ in _point of_ relationship. 55. If the son _be_ not less than the father, that _implies that_ the maker is not before the _thing_ made, nor yet is greater; (56) both must be original evolutions, (57) and the creation is not less than the creator, nor the creator greater than the creation, (58) however he _may_ be said _to be_ unlimited.

59\. _Observe_ this, too, that if the son _be_ equal to the father in all knowledge, that father also is as ignorant as the son who was unaware of his own death and execution on the tree [^18], (60) until _he was_ slain by their capturing _him_ and causing _his_ wretched death, brutal treatment, _and_ disgrace [^19]. 61. He did not know about it because they enquired of him thus: ‘When is the day of resurrection?’ And he answered thus: ‘Of this no one is aware but the father [^20].’ 62. Just as when the son is formed (tâ<i>s</i>tîk) <span id="p235"><sup><small>[ p. 235 ]</small></sup></span> as _it were_ ignorant, the father _must be_ as _it were_ just the same.

63\. _Observe_ this, too, that all the creatures and creation, _and_ even his own adversary, being created and produced by him out of nothing, the executioners of his son are themselves deluded _by him_. 64. _And_ if the sacred being himself created the executioners of his son, _and_ even his own adversary, without a purpose _and_ without a cause, (65) and the son _was_ slain by them altogether with, his knowledge, (66) that _implies that_ it is now possible to be without doubt that the slayer of his son was he himself, (67) if he knew that when he produces [^21] a son they _will_ then slay him, and _in_ the end he produced _him_ foolishly and unwisely. 68. If he did not know _it, he_ is deficient in knowledge.

69\. Again, _observe_ this, that, if the sacred being created these creatures and creation out of nothing, and created and produced even his adversary similarly out of nothing, that _implies that_ their nature ought to be one. 70. Now, why is not the adversary preserved _in_ the _same_ manner as the other creatures?

71\. Another _point_ is about the inconsistency of the statements _derived_ from the scriptures of their high-priest [^22], (72) and that which he says that no _one_ falls, nor anything from a tree, and no outcry arises in a district [^23], nor two birds fight together <span id="p236"><sup><small>[ p. 236 ]</small></sup></span> without the command of the father [^24], (73) which is a demonstration [^25] of these statements, that the original evolution is single and all _things_ are by his will.

74\. Now for what purpose _was_ the Messiah appointed, who is his son; and which way is the demonstration, through that, of his (the father's) _being_ unwilling; (75) when all is _by_ his will, and nothing whatever is said _about_ his _being_ unwilling? 76. Even this is _evident_ from the same explanation, that the Jews slew the Messiah, who is his son, through the will of the father.

77\. Again, he speaks inconsistently about the free will (â<i>z</i>â<i>d</i>\-kâmîh) of the faithful, (78) that mankind are produced by him _with_ free will. 79. Thus the iniquity of the sin which mankind commit is freely willed, (80) and the freedom of will _was_ produced by him himself for mankind. 81. That _implies that_ it is fitting to consider him likewise a sinner who is the original cause of sin. 82. If mankind commit sin and crime by their own free will through. the will of the sacred being, (83) through what free will and sin are the sin and crime of the lion, serpent, wolf, _and_ scorpion—the stinging _and_ slaying noxious creatures—which are the natural actions that ever proceed from them?

84\. So also, who _has_ maintained the origin of the deadly poison which is in the Bêsh _herb_ [^26] and other species of plants, the cause of which is not owing to free will? 85: If they say that those poisons <span id="p237"><sup><small>[ p. 237 ]</small></sup></span> are advantageous _and_ suitable in many medicines which are removers of the disease of the sick, (86) it should be asked of them thus: ‘Who produced the disease itself and the harm that _arises_ from it, and what is the necessity of it, (87) that, afterwards, medicine and deadly poison _were_ created by him for it; and were necessary?’ 88. Or, _as to_ that disease, ‘it would be more expedient if he had produced an antidotal (anôsh) medicine for carrying _it_ away than a medicine of poison.’ 89. Also this, that is, ‘from what origin is the term itself “doing harm,” and against whom is the advantageousness necessary?’ 90. On this subject it is possible to speak abundantly for a summary compiled.

91\. Another _instance_ is from the words of Paul (Pâvarô<i>s</i>), who _was_ their high-priest—(92) that _one_ who was afflictive with [^27] them at their own beginning [^28]—even this, they say, (93) is thus: ‘Not the good works which I desire, but the iniquity (94) which I do not desire, I do [^29]. 95. And _it_ is not I _that_ do _so_, but that which is collected within me does _it_, (96) because I always see that _it_ is striving with me day and night [^30].’

97\. Again, they say, from the words of the <span id="p238"><sup><small>[ p. 238 ]</small></sup></span> Messiah, that the original evolution _from_ the sacred being is light and goodness; (98) evil and darkness are separate from him [^31]. 99. Also this, that is, ‘just as a shepherd who provides protection for his hundred sheep, (100) _and_ the wolves carry _off_ one from him, (101) goes after that one which the wolves carried _off_ until he leads it back to the flock, (102) and leaves the ninety-nine of them in the wilderness (da<i>s</i>t) [^32], (103) even so I am come to take care of the defiled, not for the just, (104) because _it_ is needless to bring him who is just into the _right_ way [^33].’ 105. That _implies_, if the original evolution _be_ one, and his will _be_ wholly _that_ no one whatever of it _shall be_ astray and defiled, (106) _that_ even the wolf's slaying the sheep is likewise his will, (107) and the wolf itself _was_ also created by him.

108\. The word of the Messiah is specially inconsistently a demonstrator as regards the two original evolutions. 109. As they say this is one of _those_ same statements of the Messiah, that there is another original evolution, ‘an enemy of my father, _and_ I am of that sacred being doing good works [^34].’ 110. From this statement _it_ is evident that his own father separates from that enemy, _and_ acts differently. <span id="p239"><sup><small>[ p. 239 ]</small></sup></span> 111\. This, too, _he says_, that is, ‘I am produced _by_ the sacred being for truth and through truth [^35]; (112) and Aharman, the iniquitous, came for my death (va<i>d</i>ar<i>d</i>anŏ), (113) and I am desired by him to deceive in many ways [^36].’ 114. Now, if the original evolution _be_ one, and there be nothing competing with it, why _was_ Aharman so powerful that he desired to delude the son of the sacred being? 115. If the sacred being himself created that iniquitous _one_, then the producing of that delusion by the _latter was_ with the knowledge and will of _the former_ himself, (116) and the deluder of the son _was_ in like manner himself.

117\. This, too, it says, that, when the Jews stood disputing against _him_, he spoke to the Jews thus: ‘You are from that which is a lower _region_, and I am from an upper _region_; (118) you are of this country, I am not of it [^37].’ 119. And he also said this, that is, ‘I know that you are of the seed of Abraham, _and_ he [^38] who had slain mankind from aforetime (120) _has_ wished to slay even me. 121. I do that which is seen of my father, _and_ you do that which is seen by you as to your own father [^39].’ 122. This, <span id="p240"><sup><small>[ p. 240 ]</small></sup></span> too, _he said_, ‘If the sacred being be that father of yours, he would be a friend of me _for_ your _sake_, (123) because I have sprung from the sacred being; I have not come of my own will; (124) I am appointed _by_ that sacred being doing good works [^40]. Why do you not hear those words of mine? 125. Only because you are from the iniquitous _one it_ is not possible for you to hear them, (126) and you wish to do the will of your own father. 127. By him truth is not spoken; whatever he speaks he tells a lie of it, therefore you are false yourselves _together_ with your father. 128. _As for_ me, who speak the truth, you do not believe it of me [^41]: 129. And he who is from the sacred being hears the words of the sacred being, but you, because you are not from the sacred being, do not hear my words [^42].’ 130. By all these sayings it is demonstrated by him that there are two original evolutions, ‘one by which I am produced, _and_ one by which the Jews _are_,’ (131) and that _latter_ is not his doer of good works, but is called by him the iniquitous _one_. . .

132\. And this, too, _was_ said by him, that ‘not <span id="p241"><sup><small>[ p. 241 ]</small></sup></span> unrestricted (atang) is the tree of merit (kirfak) to produce the fruit of offensiveness (ba<i>z</i>ak), nor yet that of offensiveness _as to_ the fruit of merit [^43].’ 133. This, too, _he said_, that ‘he either makes the whole tree with fruit of merit, or the whole tree with fruit of offensiveness [^44], (134) for every tree becomes manifest by _its_ fruit, if _it be of_ merit and _if it be of_ offensivenes [^45].’ 135. And the whole tree _was_ mentioned by him, not half the tree. 136. Now, how is it suitable _for_ half a tree _to be_ light and half dark, (137) half merit and half offensiveness, (138) half truth and half falsehood? 139. When these remain both competing together, (140) they cannot become one tree.

141\. And, again, a Jewish _sect was_ called by him ‘the hill-serpent of the Jews [^46],’ (142) and he spoke thus: ‘How is _it_ possible for you to do good works when you are Jewish evil-doers [^47]?’ 143. And _it was_ not his own father he called an evil-doer [^48]. <span id="p242"><sup><small>[ p. 242 ]</small></sup></span> 144\. This, too, he says, that ‘every tree which the father _has_ not sown should be dug _up_, and should be cast into the fire [^49].’ 145. Wherefore it is fitting to understand from these words that there is a tree, which the father _has_ not sown; _that_ it is necessary to dig _up and_ cast _away_.

146\. Again, _he says_ this, that ‘I am come to my own, and I am not received _by_ my own [^50].’ 147. Wherefore it is fitting to understand that _what is_ his own and _what is_ not his own are two _things_.

148\. This, too, he says, that is, ‘Our father, that _art_ in the sky, let thy empire arise! And may it be thy will _that_ shall take place on earth as in the sky! 149. Also give us daily bread! And do not bring us to a cause of doubt [^51]!’ 150. From these words _it_ is evident that his will is not so unalloyed (a<i>v</i>ê<i>z</i>ak) on earth as in the sky. 151. Also this, that the cause of the doubt of mankind is not owing to the sacred being.

152\. And this, too, _was_ said by him at first, that I am not come for the _purpose_ that I _may_ destroy the law of Moses (Mûshâê), (153) but I am come for the _purpose_ that I _may_ make _it_ altogether more complete [^52].' 154. And _yet_ all his sayings and <span id="p243"><sup><small>[ p. 243 ]</small></sup></span> commands were those that are dissipaters and afflictive for the rules and laws of Moses.

155\. Upon this subject, however, as far as here is complete.

[^13]: (233:2) ‘Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! . . . behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and _some_ of them ye shall kill and crucify; and _some_ of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute _them_ from city to city: that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth. . . . All these things shall come upon this generation’ (Mat. xxiii. 29, 34-36).

[^20]: (234:5) ‘Tell us, when shall these things be? . . . Of that day and p. 235 _that_ hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father’ (Mark xiii. 4, 32).

[^21]: (235:1) Literally ‘I produce.’

[^22]: (235:2) In § 91 Paul is called ‘their high-priest,’ but the term may be here applied to any other writer of the Christian scriptures.

[^23]: (235:3) So in Sans., but the Pâz. of JE has merely ‘no district arises.’

[^24]: (236:1) Compare Mat. X. 29, 30:—‘Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.’

[^25]: (236:2) Literally ‘demonstrator.’

[^26]: (236:3) A poisonous plant, Napellus Moysis (see Bd. XIV, 22, XXVII, 1).

[^30]: (237:4) ‘It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. . . . I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members’ (Rom. vii. 20, 23).

[^31]: (238:1) ‘God is light, and in him is no darkness at all’ (I John i. 5).
