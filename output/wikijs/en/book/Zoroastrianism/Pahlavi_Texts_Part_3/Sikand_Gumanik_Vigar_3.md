## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER III.

1\. And _as to_ that which is asked (2) thus: ‘Why does not the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> keep Aharman back from evil doing and evil seeking, when he is the mighty maker? 3. As I assert that no mighty maker is afterwards imperfect _nor_ yet unresisting.’

4\. The answer is this, (5) that the evil deeds of Aharman are owing to the evil nature and evil will which are always his, as a fiend. 6. The omnipotence of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is that which is over all _that_ is possible to be, and is limited _thereby_. <span id="p125"><sup><small>[ p. 125 ]</small></sup></span> 7\. That which is not possible to be is not stirred up _by_ a capable _or_ an incapable being. 8. Whoever says _it is so_ is not within the limits of understanding the words. 9. Because, though he said that it is not possible to be, he says again that the sacred being is capable of it, _and_ that _has_ brought it out of the limits of _what_ is not possible to be. 10. For then _it_ is not the not-possible, but the possible to be.

11\. As his capability is limited, so also is _his_ will, thereby. 12. For _he_ is sagacious, (13) and the will of a sagacious _being_ is all for that which is possible to be, (14) and his will does not pass on to that which is not possible [^1], (15) because he wills all that which is possible _and_ fit to be.

16\. If I say that the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is able to keep Aharman back from the evil which is his perpetual nature, (17) it is possible to change that nature which is demoniacal into a divine _one_, and that which is divine into a demoniacal _one_; (18) and it is possible to make the dark light, and the light dark.

19\. _Of_ the changing of a nature by its own self those not understanding nature speak, (20) who are uninformed of the nature of the result [^2] in actions _and_ propensities [^3]; (21) and they account the wolf _and_ noxious creatures as a benefit. <span id="p126"><sup><small>[ p. 126 ]</small></sup></span> 22\. Since the harm and evil which _arise_ from mankind and cattle are not naturally their own, but are owing to the havoc, deceit, solicitation, _and_ deluding [^4] of the fiend, (23) _they_ are from the like vileness of other fiends who are such as the malice, wrath, and lust [^5] which are mingled with mankind. 24. Just as the swallowing of bitter medicine, which is mingled with poison, is not the accomplishment of happiness, but for the removal of the pain and sickness which are owing to an extraneous nature (ba<i>r</i>â gôhar). 25. As of a statement which is true _or_ false—(26) though it _may_ be that, connected with a false statement, a righteous man is preserved from much harm, and is ruined by that which is true—(27) mostly that benefit is not from the false statement, but from the removal of the destruction and evil which are mingled with the vile, (28) and that harm is not from the true statement, but from the evil which is mingled with the vile.

29\. Also, as regards that which _happens_ when opponents have appeared _in order_ to remove each one its own competitor, (30) every one is unrestricted [^6] _in_ keeping away that which is its own opponent, (31) such as light _and_ darkness, perfume _and_ stench, good works _and_ crime, erudition _and_ ignorance. 32. That _which_ is not unrestricted is the <span id="p127"><sup><small>[ p. 127 ]</small></sup></span> light to keep away stench, nor the perfume darkness; (33) but they have each separately appeared _in order_ to keep away their own opponent.

34\. _As to_ that, too, which they say [^7], that in the dark night a righteous man is preserved from the lion, wolves, dogs, and robbers, (35) _while_ in the light day he becomes a captive [^8] in their hands, (36) it is not proper to consider that as a benefit owing to darkness, nor yet as an evil owing to light. 37. Because light is created for the removal of darkness, not for the keeping away of the lion, wolf, and noxious creatures. _And there are_ many other _things_ which are of this nature. 38. On account of tediousness _this_ is collected _merely_ as a summary; the virtue _and_ understanding of you triumphant _ones_ (39) are so much, that you _may_ obtain more from revelation.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (125:1) Sans. adds ‘to be,’ and is followed by most of the modern MSS.

[^2]: (125:2) Pâz. vazîha<i>s</i>n, probably a misreading of Pahl. uzdahi<i>s</i>n.

[^3]: (125:3) Pâz. gada<i>s</i>ni, both here and in Chaps. IV, 56, VIII, 122, 123, 126, XII, 64, evidently means ‘disposition, peculiarity.’ It is probably a misreading of Pahl. gu<i>z</i>ini<i>s</i>n, occasioned by some writer connecting the two letters <i>z</i>n and so converting them into a t (<i>d</i>).

[^4]: (126:1) Nêr. reads vyâwãnî, which he understands to mean ‘bewildering,’ but it is doubtful if we can derive this meaning from vyâwãn, ‘a waterless wilderness,’ which word occurs in Chap. XIV, 30. The original Pahlavi word can be also read either nîyâ<i>z</i>ânîh, ‘cause of longing, temptation,’ or nihâ<i>z</i>ânîh, ‘intimidation.’

[^5]: (126:2) Evil passions which are personified as fiends (see Mkh. XLI, 10, 11).

[^6]: (126:3) Reading atang, instead of the similarly-written âtûk which would be the equivalent of the Pâz. atû (Sans. <i>s</i>akta) used by Nêr.

[^7]: (127:1) For the purpose of arguing that evils are sometimes advantageous, and may, therefore, form part of the design of a beneficent spirit.

[^8]: (127:2) Or grôh may mean ‘a hostage.’
