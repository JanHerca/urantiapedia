## SAD DAR. CHAPTER IX.

1\. The ninth subject is this, that it is necessary to practise abstinence from committing _or_ permitting unnatural intercourse [^3]. 2. For this is the chief of all sins _in_ the religion: there is no worse sin than this in the good religion, and it is proper to call those _who commit it_ worthy of death in reality.

3\. If any one comes forth to them, and shall see them in the act, _and_ is working with an axe [^4], it is requisite _for him_ to cut _off_ the heads or to rip up the bellies of both, _and_ it is no sin for him. 4. _But_ it is not proper to kill any person without the authority of high-priests and kings, except on account of committing _or_ permitting unnatural intercourse.

5\. For it says in revelation that unnatural intercourse is on a par with Aharman, with Afrâsiyâb [^5], with Dahâk [^5], with Tûr-i Brâ<i>d</i>ar-vakhṣh [^6] who slew <span id="p268"><sup><small>[ p. 268 ]</small></sup></span> Zaratu<i>s</i>t, with Malkôs [^1] who will arise, with the serpent Sruvar which existed in the days of Sâm Narîmân [^2], and as many sins as are theirs. 6. And Aharman, the evil _one_, becomes more joyful, owing to this practice, than owing to the other sins _which_ have made high-priests necessary [^3]; for the soul itself of that person becomes extinct.

7\. And when they commit _the sin_ with women, it is just the same as that with men.
