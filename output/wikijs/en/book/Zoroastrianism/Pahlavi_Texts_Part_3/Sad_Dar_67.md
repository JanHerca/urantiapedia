## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXVII.

1\. The sixty-seventh subject is this, that it is necessary for women to practise great abstinence from committing adultery. 2. For it is declared in revelation, _as to_ every woman who _has_ lain with a strange man, thus: ‘What is it necessary to call her, and why is the explanation [^1] that she is of one nature with all wizards and sinners?’

3\. And in the commentary of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> [^2] it says ‘“every woman who consorts with two strange men is the first _down_ upon me, who am Hôrmazd. 4. For if she takes a look into a river of water it will make _it_ diminish, if she takes a look [^3] at a tree _or_ shrub the fruit of the trees becomes scanty, and if she speaks a word with a righteous man it will make the glory [^4] of the man diminish.” 5. Zaratu<i>s</i>t enquired of Hôrmazd, “What occurs on [^5] her account?” 6. The creator Hôrmazd spoke thus: “It is necessary to kill her sooner than a biting serpent and similar creatures and wild beasts, because she is more harmful to my creatures.”’

7\. Therefore, since she is like this, it is necessary for women to keep themselves _with_ great effort, so that they _may_ not become unlawful unto their own <span id="p332"><sup><small>[ p. 332 ]</small></sup></span> husbands. 8. For, every time that _one of them_ gives herself four times to another person, she is, after that, unlawful as long as [^1] she may be _in_ the house of _her_ husband [^2] and new sin is increasing _in connection_ with her soul [^3].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (331:1) B29 has ‘and it is by reason of that fault.’

[^2]: (331:2) What follows is a free paraphrase of Vend. XVIII, 123-132.

[^3]: (331:3) Lp omits these four words.

[^5]: (331:5) Lp, B29 have ‘what is necessary.’

[^2]: (332:2) This seems to be the author's interpretation of the following commentary (Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 124<i>a</i>):—‘And it is no matter to her; for, when cohabitation is three times conceded by her, _she is_ worthy of death. Gôgô<i>s</i>asp said that this is an adulteress who is _kept_ within bounds.’

[^3]: (332:3) B29 has ‘increasing as to water and fire.’
