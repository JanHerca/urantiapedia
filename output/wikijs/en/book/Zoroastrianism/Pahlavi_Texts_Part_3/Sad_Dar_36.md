## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXXVI.

1\. The thirty-sixth subject is this, that it is strictly incumbent on mankind, on man [^6] and woman, to perform the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ [^7], because mankind feed on menstruous _matter_ in the womb of the mother. 2. For that reason it is necessary to perform the Bareshnûm once, so that _one may_ become pure from that pollution. 3. For if _one_ becomes fifteen years _of age_, and does not perform the Bareshnûm, whatever he puts a hand on, the glory and purity of that thing will diminish; and it <span id="p297"><sup><small>[ p. 297 ]</small></sup></span> is not proper that they put a hand on a sacred cake _or_ any _thing_ washed _with ceremony_.

4\. In revelation it says, if any one _who has_ not performed the Bareshnûm shall die, the demons make _him_ [^1] as though _he were_ a corpse _kept_ one month in the hot season. 5. And, when the soul arrives at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, the archangels and angels complain of the stench of that soul, _and_ are not able to make _up_ its account and reckoning. 6. It remains at the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge _and_ is not able to pass; it experiences much repentance and has no advantage from it.

7\. If it be necessary for any one to perform the Bareshnûm of the head, and he be able to do _it, but_ does not do _it_, if he performs the _ceremonial_ ablution of the head a thousand times, it does not become pure from that pollution [^2], and that is the pollution of Nasru<i>s</i>t [^3], which is amid the veins and sinews, and the flesh and bones; it does not become pure _through_ any other thing except through _the liquid consecrated by_ the religious formula [^4].

8\. And _as to_ that person, also, who performs the Bareshnûm _for_ mankind [^5], it is necessary that he be a man, a friend of the soul, a truthful speaker, _and_ an abstainer, because through chastity and modesty (mastûrî) he becomes employed. 9. If complaint of any perfidy in him is publicly diffused [^6], in that disgrace (malâmat) it is necessary that the high-priests <span id="p298"><sup><small>[ p. 298 ]</small></sup></span> _should_ dislocate his joints one by one, and it is requisite that they give him as food to the dogs. 10. So that by this action they _may_ make a man observe more chastely and continently, that this result (‘hâʓil) of sin _may_ not occur.
