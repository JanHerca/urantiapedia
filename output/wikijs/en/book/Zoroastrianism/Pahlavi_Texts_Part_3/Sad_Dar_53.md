## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LIII.

1\. The fifty-third subject is this, that, when, in former [^3] times, any one wished to go on a journey (safar) that might have been at least [^4] twelve leagues (parasang), they would have consecrated a sacred cake, so that no affliction might happen in that journey, and affairs might be according to _their_ wish, and employments (su_gh_l) [^5] cheerful. 2. And it is _still_ incumbent on every one that, when they wish to go on a journey, _they are_ to consecrate this sacred cake.

3\. _And_, while the person is on the journey, he _should_ order the consecration of this sacred cake, in his house, every Bahirâm day [^6], so that that person _may_ arrive in safety (salâmat) at _his_ house. 4. <span id="p316"><sup><small>[ p. 316 ]</small></sup></span> The dedicatory formula is this—Amahê hutâ<i>s</i>tahê [^1]—_and_ is known to the priest himself.
