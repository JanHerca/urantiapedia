## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER X.

1\. Another subject is about the deliberating of the deliberators on unity, from which even the preparation of the duality is manifested.

2\. It should be known, that whoever wishes to understand a creator, except when he gives trouble to his own life, (3) should meditate reverently [^1]. 4. First, he fully understands his own body and soul, (5) that is, who produced _them_, out of what, and for what purpose? 6. Also, who is his accuser and adversary; (7) and who is his friend and helper? 8. Likewise, who instigates him to commit crime, (9) of what nature _is he_, (10) and how is it possible to escape him?

11\. Then _he_ is not able to understand him [^2] _as_ the creator through his nature and his coming to himself. 12. For when he bore the name of creator, then, with it, he brought these three creations [^3]:—(13) creation, religion, and soul. 14. Because the name of creator is known from the occurrence of creation. 15. This _implies_ that the creator of the creation created the creations for duty, (16) but does not release _them_ from duty. 17. And the duty of the creatures is to understand _and_ perform the will of the creator, (18) _and_ to abstain from _what is_ disliked _by him_. 19. To act by the will of the creator, and to abstain from _what is_ disliked by him, is to preserve the soul. 20. The will of the creator is not understood, <span id="p167"><sup><small>[ p. 167 ]</small></sup></span> except from the religion of the creator. 21. _And_ the religion is appointed by the creator free from doubt.

22\. Now it is expedient to know that the sacred being appointed the religion for the understanding of his will, (23) and from the understanding of his will for the preservation of the soul are manifested the compassion and mercifulness of the sacred being. 24. From the preservativeness of the religion for the soul are manifested the grandeur and valuableness of the religion; (25) from the necessity of preserving the soul are manifested the defilement and delusion [^4] of the soul; (26) _and_ from the defilement and delusion of the soul is manifested a defiler and deluder of the thoughts, words, _and_ deeds of mankind. 27. On the whole a corrupter of souls is manifest.

28\. And now it is expedient for us to well recognise [^5] and know, as to that defiler who is a corrupter of souls, of what nature _he is_. 29. Because, if the creation _and_ achievement of the sacred being are said _to be_ of a like nature, then how did the sacred being appoint the religion for the preservation of the soul? 30. That is not expedient for him—_if_ a defiler and deluder of souls—to produce [^6] as his own creation and will [^7]. 31. For if he be himself the creator, and be himself the defiler and corrupter of souls, _and_ nothing occurs except by his will, (32) <span id="p168"><sup><small>[ p. 168 ]</small></sup></span> then, when it is necessary for us to write of preservation from the sacred being [^8], whom _shall_ we make _as_ a refuge [^9]?

33\. Now it is necessary _for_ every intelligent person to understand _and_ to know thus much, (34) that is, from whom it is necessary for us to flee and to abstain, (35) and with whom is the hope, and with whom the maintenance, of our protection. 36. The method for this acquisition is nothing else but to understand the sacred being in _his_ nature, (37) because, as I wrote above [^10], _it_ is not only to know _his_ existence, but it is necessary to understand _his_ nature and his will.

38\. And I _have_ observed, in the world, the sectarian belief of all maintainers of sects who hold \[the two fundamental _doctrines_\] [^11]. 39. One is that which asserts that all the good and evil, which are in the world, are owing to the sacred being. 40. _And_ one is that which asserts that all the good of the world, besides the hope of preserving the soul, is owing to the sacred being; (41) and the cause of all evil of the body, besides the risk of the soul, is owing to Aharman; (42) _and_ all _things_ have started from appointment _by_ these two origins into various formations _and_ various subdivisions.

43\. Now I have been an enquirer everywhere, for understanding the sacred being, as written above [^12], <span id="p169"><sup><small>[ p. 169 ]</small></sup></span> fervent-minded in the investigation of his religion and will; (44) as likewise I have wandered, for the sake of investigation, to the region without and the land of the Hindûs, and _to_ many different races. 45. Because, _as to_ religion, I did not admire that which _was_ in supremacy [^13], (46) but <i>I</i> sought that which _was_ more steadfast and more acceptable in wisdom and testimony. 47. I went also into association with many different races, (48) until a time (49) when, owing to the compassion of the sacred beings, and the strength, glory, and power of the good religion, I escaped from much gloomy depth and ill-solvable doubt.

50\. By the united power of knowledge of the religion (51) and the well-reflecting writing of the wise, (52) the marvellous allegorical [^14] writings of the learned Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>îyâvand [^15], (53) and by that writing which the glorified Rôshan [^16], son of Âtûr-frôbag, prepared—(54) for which he appointed the name of the Rôshan manuscript (nipîk)—(55) _and_ likewise that _for_ which the supremely learned _and_ righteous Âtûr-frôbag [^17], son of Farukh-zâ<i>d</i>, (56) who _was_ the <span id="p170"><sup><small>[ p. 170 ]</small></sup></span> leader of those of the good religion, (57) appointed the name of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> manuscript—owing to _its_ explaining the religion [^18]—(58) I am saved from the many doubts, delusions, deceits, and follies of sects, (59) and, especially, from those of the deceivers, the very great _and_ very mighty, very evil-teaching _and_ empty-skulled [^19] Manicheans [^20], (60) whose devotion is witchcraft, _whose_ religion is deceitfulness, and _whose_ teaching is folly and intricate secret proceedings.

61\. I have been deliberately confirmed by the power of wisdom and the strength of knowledge of the religion, (62) not through obstinate faith [^21], but by the pure revelation opposed to the demon [^22], which is the decision of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> (63) that _was_ taught by the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^23].

64\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t came alone, on a true mission, to the lofty portal of Kaî Gu<i>s</i>tâsp [^24], (65) and the religion was taught by him, with a powerful tongue, to Kaî Gu<i>s</i>tâsp and the learned, through the speech of wisdom, through manual gestures, through definite words, through explanation of many doubts, and through presentation of the visible testimony of the <span id="p171"><sup><small>[ p. 171 ]</small></sup></span> archangels, _together_ with many miracles. 66. And a greatness in power which is not the destiny of worldly existences was theirs who saw him of the vehement guardian spirit. 67. And Kaî Spend-dâ<i>d</i> [^25] and Zargar [^26] and other _royal_ sons (zâ<i>d</i>ak), instigating the many conflicts and shedding the blood of those of the realm, accepted the religion as a yoke [^27], (68) while they even wandered to Arûm [^28] and the Hindûs, outside the realm, in propagating the religion.

69\. Owing to _progress_ onwards it came in succession to the descendants of the divinities [^29], the rulers who _were_ those of the Kayân race who _were_ exalted ones. 70. _And_ still onwards even until the achievement with melted metal pouring upon the chest of the glorified Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i> [^30], son of Mâraspend, in the reign of that divinity (bagh) Shâhpûr, the king of kings who _was the son of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^31], in a controversy with apostates of different species of many kinds. 71. _He was_ preserved from those most <span id="p172"><sup><small>[ p. 172 ]</small></sup></span> mighty apostates, who are called even by _the name of_ their desires [^32].

72\. And the Arûmans [^33], who have been, at various periods, termed untruthful [^34], _have_ asked many ill-solvable questions of this religion; (73) _but there has_ been no doubtfulness of any question that is explained by this religion, (74) and the learned of the country of Irân have always been sustainers of victory among them. 75. Not like other sects whose religion is secretly progressive and deceiving, delusively for the deceived, _and_ undutifully among the customs and assemblages of the less-informed, unintelligent, and demon-natured whose information was nothing whatever of knowledge and understanding of wisdom. 76. Then, so far as the assemblages that are very secretly deceived and deluded by them, nobody is presented for detection (â<i>s</i>kârâkîh); (77) _but_ afterwards, owing to the capture of the many of little knowledge and unintelligent opinions who are deluded by them, it is discovered they are _provided_ with much mutually afflicting speech, falsehood, _and_ disconnection, which are their religion.

78\. So that I here [^35] notice _some_ of _their_ much inconsistency and disconnection, for informing the judgment of new learners, (79) for the reason that when the writings of the learned ancients have specially minutely and reverently [^36] discoursed of <span id="p173"><sup><small>[ p. 173 ]</small></sup></span> _what is_ most astute in evil, to impel _one_ to good knowledge, (80) you _should_ observe with kind regards _what is_ ordered.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (166:1) See Chap. VIII, 137 n.

[^2]: (166:2) His accuser and instigator.

[^3]: (166:3) All MSS. have ‘he bore these three names;’ but Nêr. has evidently misread <i>s</i>em, ‘name,’ instead of dâm, ‘creature,’ both words being written alike in Pahlavi.

[^4]: (167:1) Pâz. vyâwãnî (see Chap. III, 22 n).

[^5]: (167:2) Assuming that Pâz. huzvârdan (Sans. sa<i>m</i><i>s</i>odhayitum) is a misreading of Pahl. hû-zinhâr<i>d</i>anŏ.

[^6]: (167:3) Sans. ‘to announce.’

[^7]: (167:4) Because it (the religion) is opposed to his supposed work as a deluder.

[^8]: (168:1) As it would be, if he were the corrupter of souls.

[^9]: (168:2) The exclamation of the wicked soul after death, derived from Yas. XLV, 1 (see Mkh. II, 159).

[^10]: (168:3) See Chap. V, 6-9.

[^11]: (168:4) The words in brackets are omitted in AK, PB3, MH19, but occur in Sans. and the later MSS.

[^12]: (168:5) Chap. I. 36, 37.

[^13]: (169:1) Probably a guarded allusion to Muhammadanism which it was then unsafe to disparage openly, as is evident from the rarity of its name in Pahlavi writings.

[^14]: (169:2) Or ‘the miracle-resembling.’

[^15]: (169:3) See Chap. IV, 106.

[^16]: (169:4) A commentator whose opinions are often quoted in Pahlavi writings (see Sls. I, 4 n). His father was probably the early editor of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> mentioned in §§ 55-57, though it is hazardous to rely upon a single name for identifying an individual. In that case he must have been a younger brother of the Zaratû<i>s</i>t-î Âtûr-frôbagân who succeeded his father as ‘leader of the good religion,’ and revised the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, as mentioned in the last paragraphs of its third book.

[^17]: (169:5) See Chap: IV, 107.

[^18]: (170:1) The probable meaning of dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> is ‘acts of the religion.’ See also Chap. IV, 107 n.

[^19]: (170:2) Reading rat-mastarg. For rat Nêr. has read ra<i>d</i>, ‘pontiff,’ which is written in the same manner; his translation being Sans. guru, while his Pâz. ra<i>d</i> has become raê in AK, PB3, MH19, but has again become ra<i>d</i> in JE.

[^20]: (170:3) See Chap. XVI.

[^21]: (170:4) Assuming that Pâz. sakht-vîrôda<i>s</i>nihâ stands for Pahl. sakht-virôyi<i>s</i>nîhâ.

[^22]: (170:5) That is, the Vendîdâ<i>d</i>.

[^23]: (170:6) See Mkh. I, 10.

[^24]: (170:7) See Mkh. XIII, 14, XXVII, 68-76.

[^25]: (171:1) Misread Spudâkht by Nêr. He was a son of Kaî Gu<i>s</i>tâsp, and called Spe<i>n</i>tô-dâta in the Avesta, and Isfendiyâr in Persian.

[^26]: (171:2) Av. Zairivairi, Pers. Zarîr, a brother of Kaî Gu<i>s</i>tâsp (see Bd. XXXI, 29).

[^27]: (171:3) Literally ‘for the neck,’ assuming that Pâz. ô-<i>k</i>a ôi is an erroneous reading of Pahl. va<i>l</i> <i>k</i>avarman, as in Mkh. XXXIX, 30.

[^28]: (171:4) Asia Minor was so called from having been a portion of the Roman empire in Sasanian times.

[^29]: (171:5) Pâz. bayãnã, (Sans. mahat) is evidently a misreading of Pahl. bagânân, a term referring to the Sasanian kings who adopted the title of bagî, ‘divinity,’ in their inscriptions (see also § 70), and claimed to be descended from the old dynasty of Kayân kings.

[^30]: (171:6) The supreme high-priest and prime minister of king Shâhpûr II (A.D. 309-379), who underwent the ordeal of melted metal for the sake of proving the truth of the religion.

[^31]: (171:7) King Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> II (A.D. 300-309).

[^32]: (172:1) That is, they are called âshmôg (Av. ashemaogha, ‘perplexing righteousness’).

[^33]: (172:2) The Greeks of the eastern empire of the Romans.

[^34]: (172:3) Pâz. anâst may be either ‘irreverent,’ or else stand for Pahl. a<i>r</i>âst, ‘untruthful.’ Sans. has ‘atheistical.’

[^35]: (172:4) In the next chapter.

[^36]: (172:5) Or, perhaps, ‘modestly’ (see Chap. VIII, 137 n).
