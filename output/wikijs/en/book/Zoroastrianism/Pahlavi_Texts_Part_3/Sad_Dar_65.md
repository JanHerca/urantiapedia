## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXV.

1\. The sixty-fifth subject is this, that every one is to practise thanksgiving continually, _and_ it is requisite _that_ he maintains _it_ through good and bad; and _he is_ to keep in view [^1] the benefits of Hôrmazd. 2. Because the creator [^2] Hôrmazd demands two things from mankind, the one is that _one should_ not commit sin, and the other is that _one should_ practise thanksgiving. 3. And how much soever more grateful mankind become, through virtue _and_ worthiness as regards him, they [^3] grant more abundant daily provision for the grateful than that which is for other persons. 4. And _as to_ every one who is not grateful _to_ him, the bread that he eats becomes unlawful, and it is not proper for any one to do good _in connection_ with him. <span id="p329"><sup><small>[ p. 329 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. And it is declared in revelation that when an unthankful person dies, wherever they deposit. His corpse, the archangel Spendârma<i>d</i> [^4] is trembling like a sheep that sees a wolf. 6. And _as to_ a bird that eats that corpse, on whatever tree it rests and settles, it makes that tree wither away, and the person _who_ sits down in the shadow of the tree becomes ill.

7\. There are different things that it is necessary for those of the good religion to make predominant over themselves. 8. One is to exercise liberality _in connection_ with the worthy; the second is to do justice; the third is to be friendly unto every one; and the fourth is to be sincere and true [^5], and to keep falsehood far from themselves. 9. And these four habits (‘<i>h</i>aʓlat) are the principles (aʓl) of the religion of Zaratu<i>s</i>t, and it is necessary, when thou listenest _to them_ thyself, _that_ thou dost not listen to any one _else_ [^6]. 10. Because the creator Hôrmazd says, ‘O Zaratu<i>s</i>t! if thou wilt that thou become pure and saved, _and that_ thou arrive at the place of the pure, do thou accomplish these two duties:—11. One is this, that thou prefer the friendship of the spiritual _existence to that of_ the worldly _one_, and consider the things of the world as contemptible and those of the spirit precious; on this account the glory of the world is sought [^7] with scorn, and do not thou let the spirit escape. 12. The second is this, that thou speak truly with every one and act justly with me, <span id="p330"><sup><small>[ p. 330 ]</small></sup></span> that is, whatever thou dost not approve for thyself do not approve [^8] for any one _else;_ when thou hast acted in this manner thou art righteous.’
