## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXIV.

1\. The sixty-fourth subject is this, that it is necessary to practise great abstinence from committing theft [^1] and seizing anything from mankind by force.

2\. For it is declared in revelation that, _as to_ every one who steals one dirham [^2] away from another, when they really know _it_, it is necessary to take two dirhams away from him; one dirham _being_ that which _was_ carried off, and one dirham as the fine of him who committed the theft. 3. It is also requisite to cut _off_ one ear, and it is necessary to strike ten _blows with_ a stick, and to detain _him_ one period in prison. <span id="p327"><sup><small>[ p. 327 ]</small></sup></span> 4\. And if he shall steal another [^3] dirham, in the same manner _one_ is to take away two dirhams [^4], to cut _off_ the other ear, to strike twenty _blows with_ a stick, and to detain _him_ two periods [^5] in prison. 5. And if he shall steal three dirhams and two dângs [^6], it is requisite to cut _off his_ right hand. 6. If he shall steal five hundred dirhams [^7], it is requisite to hang _him_.

7\. _On_ the spot the punishment is this, and among the spirits it brings punishment on the soul itself. 8. And, if the _other_ person does not know _it_, they take away twice as much good work, among the spirits, from that _thief_, and give _it_ to the soul of this person. 9. If _the thief_ possesses no good works, they give the compensation from the constantly-beneficial treasury [^8], and exhibit the punishment on the soul of that _thief_.

10\. _As to_ that person who has seized anything <span id="p328"><sup><small>[ p. 328 ]</small></sup></span> from another by force, among the spirits they seize back four _things_ [^9] as compensation for every single one. 11. And if, _on_ the spot _where people_ capture him, he makes _it_ convenient to return four _things_ in compensation _for_ one, when they have fully understood, as they capture that person who is committing highway-robbery, _that_ he makes _it_ convenient [^10], they _may_ kill him at once.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (326:5) B29, J15 have ‘violence.’

[^2]: (326:6) A silver coin of 63 grains in weight, or about 5 3/5 annas (see Dd. LII, 1 n); say, seven-pence.

[^3]: (327:1) Lp has ‘two.’

[^4]: (327:2) Lp has ‘to take four.’

[^5]: (327:3) The Gu<i>g</i>arâti translator takes ‘one period’ as ‘one gha<i>d</i>î (24 minutes),’ but ‘two periods’ as ‘2½ gha<i>d</i>î (one hour).’ The word sâ’hat, ‘period,’ means also ‘an hour,’ but so short a term of imprisonment seems improbable.

[^6]: (327:4) That is, 3½ dirhams, nearly, 1¼ rûpî, or, say, two shillings.

[^7]: (327:5) That is, 175 rûpîs, or, say, £ 14 12<i>s</i>.

[^8]: (327:6) Where all supererogatory good works are supposed to be kept in store by the angels, for the purpose of granting them to souls who deserve them, but have been unable to acquire a sufficiency. It is said to be situated in the ‘endless light’ of heaven, and is the misvânô gâtu<i>s</i> <i>h</i><i>v</i>adhâtô, ‘ever-benefiting place, the self-sustained,’ of Vend. XIX, 122. Perhaps gan<i>g</i>, ‘treasury,’ may have been originally gun<i>g</i>, ‘space,’ which would better suit the idea of a ‘self-sustained place’ (see Dd. XXVI, 3, XXXI, 24, XXXVII, 22, 24, XXXVIII, 3). The term ‘treasurer,’ applied to the female personifications of conscience who meet the soul with the stores of its good works and sins. (sec Sg. IV, 92-96), seems to have no connection with this treasury of other people's good works.

[^9]: (328:1) Twice as much as in cases of theft without violence (see § 2).

[^10]: (328:2) So that they may not interfere with such benefit for his soul as he may obtain by atonement. These old priestly laws having much more consideration for the soul than for the body.
