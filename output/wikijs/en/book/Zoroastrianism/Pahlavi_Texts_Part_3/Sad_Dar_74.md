## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXXIV.

1\. The seventy-fourth subject is this, that _at_ dawn, when they rise up from sleep, it is first necessary to throw something [^1] on the hands, that is the <span id="p338"><sup><small>[ p. 338 ]</small></sup></span> hand-cleansing [^2]. 2. Afterwards, _they are_ to wash the hands quite clean with water, _in_ such manner that _they are_ to wash the hands three times from the forearm (sâ’hid) to the end of the hand; and the face is washed from behind the ears to below the chin _and_ up to the crown of the head; and _one_ washes the feet three times thoroughly, as far as the leg (sâq); then _one_ recites the K<i>e</i>m-nâ-mazdâ [^3].

3\. If it be a place where _there_ is no water, and the risk be that _the time for_ the Nyâyi<i>s</i> [^4] _should_ pass by, it is requisite to cleanse [^5] the hands three times _with_ dust, and to perform the Nyâyi<i>s</i>. 4. Afterwards, when _one_ arrives at water, _he is_ to wash the hands and face a second time, and to accomplish the Nyâyi<i>s</i> [^6].

5\. Before _the time_ when _one_ throws something on the hands it is not proper to wash the hands and face, _and_ it is a Tanâvar sin; it is also not possible to work at anything whatever _with_ the hands and face not washed.
