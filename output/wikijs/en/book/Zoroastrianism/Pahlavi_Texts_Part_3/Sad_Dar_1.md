## SAD DAR. CHAPTER I.

1\. The first subject is this, that it is necessary that they become steadfast in the religion, and do not introduce any hesitation (<i>s</i>akk) and doubt into the heart. 2. And _that_ they make a statement (‘haqîqat) with confidence (i’htiqâd), that the good religion, the true and perfect, _which_ the Lord sent into the world (‘<i>h</i>alq), is that which Zaratu<i>s</i>t has brought; which is this I hold [^1].

3\. Every time [^2] that mankind are like this, and do <span id="p258"><sup><small>[ p. 258 ]</small></sup></span> not introduce any hesitation _and_ doubt into the heart, of every duty _and_ good work that _others_ have done, from the days of Zaratu<i>s</i>t until these days, and of whatever _one_ does after this until the resurrection, _there_ is a share [^3] _for_ that person. 4. When the soul, on the fourth night [^4], arrives at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, the angel Mihir and the angel Rashn [^5] make up its account (‘hisâb) and reckoning. 5. And, if the good works it has done _be_ deficient _in_ quantity, of every duty _and_ good work that those of the good religion have done _in_ the earth of seven regions they appoint it a like portion (naʓîb), till the good works become more in weight [^6]; and the soul arrives righteous in the radiant locality of heaven.

6\. For it is declared in revelation, that of the duty [^7] _and_ good work which they perform in doubt—that is (ya’hnî), they entertain a suspicion like this, that ‘I do not know that this faith, which I possess, is better _in comparison_ with other faiths’—no merit whatever comes to their souls. 7. Therefore, the first (avval) thing is to become steadfast in the religion; and this is the chief of all good works.
