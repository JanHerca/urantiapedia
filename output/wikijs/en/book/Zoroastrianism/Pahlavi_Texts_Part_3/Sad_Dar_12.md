## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XII.

1\. The twelfth subject is this, that, when any one dies, an order is necessary [^1] _that_ how much soever scantier [^2] clothing they are able to make a beginning _of_, the better they act. 2. Beside (illâ) [^3] something become old _and_ washed, anything new is not proper for _the purpose_ that they _may_ let _it_ go upon a dead body.

3\. For in the commentary of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> [^4] it asserts that, if they _shall_ pass on to a dead body as much as a woman's spindle makes for a single thread, with the exception of that which is unavoidable, for every single thread a black snake hangs, in that _other_ world, on to the liver of that person who has made a beginning of the clothing. 4. Likewise, that dead _person_ becomes his antagonist (‘<i>h</i>aʓ̣m), and hangs similarly [^5] upon _his_ skirt, and speaks thus: ‘This clothing, which thou hast put on my body, devours _me, having_ become worms and noxious creatures. 5. _My_ name _was_ put upon a sacred cake [^6], the fourth _day_, with a Ya<i>s</i>t, so that _there_ <span id="p273"><sup><small>[ p. 273 ]</small></sup></span> might be alike a benefit therefrom for my soul, and it might be alike unnecessary for thee to bear this torment (’haDHâb).’ 6. Owing to that, many sorrows come to that person, and he has no advantage from it. 7. Therefore, it is necessary to act _with_ caution (i’htiyâ<i>t</i>), so that, how much soever the clothing be scantier [^1], they _may_ make a beginning _of it_.

8\. And as many as shall be able to walk after the bier (tâbût) and corpse shall walk. 9. Because every step that they go after a corpse is a good work of three hundred stîrs [^2]; _and_ every stîr is four dirhams, in such manner that three hundred stîrs are a thousand _and_ two hundred dirhams [^3]. 10. For every single step _there_ is thus much good work.
