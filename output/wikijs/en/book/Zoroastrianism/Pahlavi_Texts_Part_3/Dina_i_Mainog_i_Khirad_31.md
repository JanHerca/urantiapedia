## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER XXXI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘What is the business of the priests, warriors, and husbandmen [^1], each separately?’

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'The business of the priests is to maintain the religion properly; (5) and to perform the ceremonial and invocation of the sacred beings well _and_ with attention, <span id="p68"><sup><small>[ p. 68 ]</small></sup></span> (6) and [^2] the decrees, decisions [^3], custom, and control [^4], as revealed by the pure, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers. 7. To make people aware of the goodness of good works [^5]; (8) and to show the way to heaven, and the danger and avoidance of hell.

9\. 'The business of the warriors is to defeat the enemy; (10) and to keep their own country and land (bûm) [^6] unalarmed and tranquil.

11\. ‘And the business of the husbandmen is to perform tillage and cultivation; (12) and, to the extent of _their_ ability, to keep the world invigorated and populous.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (67:5) The three classes which are often mentioned in the Avesta as constituting the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping community. For their vices, see Chap. LIX.

[^2]: (68:1) L19 inserts ‘to keep true.’

[^3]: (68:2) K43 has dâ<i>d</i> dâ<i>d</i>istân, ‘decisions of the law;’ but the repetition of the syllable dâ<i>d</i> is probably a clerical blunder.

[^4]: (68:3) L19 omits va band, ‘and control.’

[^5]: (68:4) L19 has ‘aware of good works and sin.’

[^6]: (68:5) L19 has vîma<i>n</i>d, ‘frontier.’
