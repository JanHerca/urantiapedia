## SAD DAR. CHAPTER IV.

1\. The fourth subject is this, that it is not desirable for any one that he _should_ become hopeless of the pity (ra‘hmat) and forgiveness of Hôrmazd, and fix _his_ heart outwardly [^1] on this, that our sin is excessive _and it is_ not possible to arrive in heaven. 2. Because it happens that a small quantity of duty _and_ good work is performed, _and_ it may be that for that <span id="p261"><sup><small>[ p. 261 ]</small></sup></span> quantity Hôrmazd, the good _and_ propitious, _may_ have pity on him _and may_ make _him_ arrive in heaven.

3\. For it is declared in revelation [^2], that one time when Zaratu<i>s</i>t was in conversation _with_ the sacred being, the most high, he saw a man whose whole [^3] body was in hell, and one foot—the right _one_ [^4]—was outside of hell. 4. Zaratu<i>s</i>t enquired of the sacred being, the most high [^5], thus: ‘What person has this man been?’ 5. Hôrmazd, the good _and_ propitious, gave a reply (<i>g</i>avâb) thus: ‘He has been a king, and possessed the sovereignty of thirty-three towns, and was conducting that sovereignty many years. 6. And he never did any virtuous action, but was committing much oppression, lawlessness, and violence (_th_ulṁ) . 7. By chance (qaʓ̣ârâ) he was one day going on the chase, _and_ arrived out at a place (maûʓ̣a’h) _and_ saw a goat _that_ was tied. 8. A morsel of hay _was_ placed very far _off_, and that goat was hungry. 9. Owing to this the goat was trying to eat the hay, but did not reach the hay. 10. This the king saw, _and_ kicked _his_ foot at that hay _and_ cast _it_ in front of the goat. 11. Now, in recompense for that, that one foot of his is outside of hell, and the remaining (bâqî) limbs [^6] are in hell.’

12\. Therefore, although a sin has happened to any one, it is not necessary _for him_ [^7] to become hopeless. 13. And whoever has the power (<i>t</i>âqat) <span id="p262"><sup><small>[ p. 262 ]</small></sup></span> is to endeavour to perform good works, so that _there_ may be an atonement for the sin thereby; because the sacred being, the good _and_ propitious, is kind to every one.
