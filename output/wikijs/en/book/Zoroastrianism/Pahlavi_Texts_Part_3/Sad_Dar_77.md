## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXXVII.

1\. The seventy-seventh subject is this, that, when a woman's infant is still-born, it is necessary to give _her_ first something washed with ceremony _and_ brought _with_ fire-ashes [^3], so that it _may_ make the heart within her pure. 2. After that, _for_ three days, it is altogether improper to give _her_ water, _or_ anything in which _there_ is water or salt. 3. And these three days are from period to period [^4], _in_ such a <span id="p341"><sup><small>[ p. 341 ]</small></sup></span> manner that, if the duty of mid-day [^1] prayer has occurred, they extend till the mid-day prayer itself, _and she is_ to pass over one other hour _and_ it is _then_ proper to swallow water. 4. After that, till the lapse of forty days, _she is_ to sit apart again, and, afterwards, to undergo the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ [^2].

5\. _On_ the infant's becoming a four-months’ _child_, whenever it is _still-_born it is a dead _body_ [^3], for the reason that so long as it does not reach the fourth month life does not come to it. 6. And if after three months this affair occurs, _one is_ to exercise great caution (i‘htiyâ<i>t</i>) and to insist strictly on this matter.

7\. For our religion has reiterated on this matter that, if _one_ be polluted and do not keep himself pure, so long as he is living he never becomes clean from that pollution. 8. That, if he wash _his_ head ten thousand times in _ceremonial_ ablution, he certainly does not any _way_ become pure from it [^4]. 9. Because this pollution is not from without; it is from within every bone and vein and tendon; _and_ water makes clean _only_ anything that is on the skin. 10. Impurity which is _in_ the bones, except _through the liquid consecrated by_ the religious formula [^5], does not otherwise become clean.

## Footnotes

[^3]: (340:3) So in B29, which agrees with Vend. VII, 163, but La, Lp are defective. The ‘something’ means consecrated bull's urine, as in Chap. LXXIV, 1; this, mingled with ashes, is prescribed as the first thing to be tasted by the woman.

[^4]: (340:4) That is, from the given hour to the same hour on the third day, although, from what follows, it appears that, if the given hour were in the middle of any period of the day, the third day would expire at the beginning of the third similar period. Whether the three days are to be inclusive, or exclusive, of the day when the term begins, that is, whether the term is to be nearly 48 or 72 hours, is not very clear.

[^1]: (341:1) Literally ‘former, early.’

[^2]: (341:2) See Chap. XXXVI, 1 n.

[^3]: (341:3) And, therefore, to be treated with all the precautions necessary in dealing with a corpse to avoid the pollution alluded to in §§ 710. Hence the necessity of careful enquiry in doubtful cases, as recommended in § 6.

[^4]: (341:4) B29 omits § 8.

[^5]: (341:5) See Chap. XXXVI, 7 n.
