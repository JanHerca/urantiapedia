## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXXII.

1\. The thirty-second subject is this, that, when a hen utters a crow in a house, or the cock crows. unseasonably, it is desirable that they do not kill it [^1], and do not consider _it_ a bad habit (fa’hl). 2. Because it is uttering that crow _for_ the reason that a fiend has found a way into that house, and the hen or the cock, _alone_, does not possess the power (<i>t</i>âqat) that _would_ keep the fiend away from that house, and the hen is going to give the cock assistance, and utters the crow. 3. Therefore, if any time the chance (ittifâq) happens in that manner, it is requisite to bring another cock, so that they <span id="p294"><sup><small>[ p. 294 ]</small></sup></span> _may_ drive away that fiend through the assistance of one another. 4. And if a cock crows unseasonably it is likewise not desirable to kill _it_, because the reason may be this which I have stated.

5\. For it is declared in the good religion, that there is a fiend whom they call Sê<i>g</i> [^1], _and_, in every house _where_ an infant exists, that _fiend_ strives that she _may_ cause some misfortune to come upon that house. 6. _So_ it is necessary that they _should_ keep a cock _on_ the watch for her, so that it _may_ smite that fiend and force _her_ to the road _away_ from that house.
