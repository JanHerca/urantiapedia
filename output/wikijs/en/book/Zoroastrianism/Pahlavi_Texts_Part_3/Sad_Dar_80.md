## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXXX.

1\. The eightieth subject is this, that there is a time when thou recitest one Ashem-vohû [^3], _and_ the merit of it may be as much as _that of_ ten. 2. There is a time when thou recitest one Ashem-vohû, _and_ the merit of it may be as much as _that of_ a hundred. 3. A time may be when thou recitest one [^4], _and_ the merit of it may be as much as _that of_ a thousand. 4. A time may be when the merit of one Ashem-vohû [^5] may be as much as _that of_ ten thousand. 5. <span id="p344"><sup><small>[ p. 344 ]</small></sup></span> A time may be when the merit of one Ashem-vohû is as much as the value (qîmat) [^1] of this world and that _other_ world [^2].

6\. As for that Ashem-vohû whose nature [^3] is as much as ten, that is when they recite _it_ as they eat bread. 7. That which is, from nature, as much as a hundred is when they recite _it_ after eating [^4]. 8. That which is so much by nature that, _having_ turned side over side, they recite _it_ correctly may be a merit of a thousand [^5]. 9. That which is of the nature of ten thousand is that which thou recitest when thou risest up from sleep [^6]. 10. And that whose nature is as much as this world and that _other_ world [^7] is when they recite _it_ at the time of the dissolution of life; for, if he be not able to recite _it_ himself, friends and relations give _it_ into his mouth. 11 [^8]. If he be fit for hell he becomes fit for the ever-stationary, if he be fit for the ever-stationary he becomes fit for heaven, _and_ if he be fit for heaven he becomes fit for the supreme heaven [^9].
