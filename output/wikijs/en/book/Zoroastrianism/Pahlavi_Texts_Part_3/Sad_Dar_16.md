## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XVI.

1\. The sixteenth subject is this, that, when a woman becomes pregnant in a house, it is necessary to make an endeavour so that _there may_ be a continual fire in that house, and to maintain a good watch _over it_. 2. And, when the child becomes separate from the mother, it is necessary to burn a lamp _for_ three nights _and_ days—if they burn a fire it would be better—so that the demons and fiends _may_ not be able to do any damage and harm; because, when a child is born, it is exceedingly delicate _for_ those three days.

3\. For it is declared in revelation [^1], that, when Zaratu<i>s</i>t, the Spitamân, became separate from _his_ mother, every night, _for_ three nights, a demon came on, with a hundred and fifty _other_ demons, so that they _might_ effect the slaughter (halâk) of Zaratu<i>s</i>t, _and_, when they had beheld the light of the fire, they had fled away, and had not been able to do any damage and harm.

4\. During forty days it is not proper that they _should_ leave the child alone; and it is also not proper that the mother of the infant _should_ put _her_ foot over a threshold in the dwelling, or cast _her_ eyes upon a hill, _for_ it [^2] is bad _for_ her menstruation.
