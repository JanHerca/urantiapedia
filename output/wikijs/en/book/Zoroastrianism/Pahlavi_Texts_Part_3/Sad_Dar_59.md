## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LIX.

1\. The fifty-ninth subject is this, that, in the good _and_ pure religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, they have not commanded the women to perform the Nyâyi<i>s</i>es [^1]. 2. And [^2] their Nyâyi<i>s</i>es are these, that three times every day, _at_ dawn, mid-day [^3] prayer, and evening prayer, they stand back in the presence of their own husbands, and fold their arms and speak thus: ‘What are thy thoughts, so that I _may_ think them; what is necessary for thee, so that I _may_ speak it; and what is necessary for thee, so that I _may_ do it?’

3\. For, any command, and whatever the husband <span id="p321"><sup><small>[ p. 321 ]</small></sup></span> orders, it is requisite to go about that day. 4. _And_, certainly, without the leave (riʓ̣â) of the husband _she is_ to do no work, so that the Lord _may_ be pleased with that wife. 5. For the satisfaction of the sacred being is in a reverence (ya<i>s</i>t) for [^4] the satisfaction of the husband; so that every time that they perform work _by_ command of the husband they call them righteous in the religion; and if not, what do they call them?
