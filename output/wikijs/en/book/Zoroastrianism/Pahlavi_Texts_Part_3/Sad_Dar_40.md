## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XL.

1\. The fortieth subject is this, that it is not desirable to distress _one's_ priest, _or_ father, _or_ mother; and, if _people_ perceive much trouble, disquietude, and harm _arising_ from them, it is certainly not desirable that they _should_ give them back a reply with any aggravation. 2. Because their satisfaction is connected with the satisfaction of the sacred being, _and_ every time that _people_ distress them they have <span id="p302"><sup><small>[ p. 302 ]</small></sup></span> distressed Hôrmazd, the good _and_ propitious. 3. It is not possible _for_ any duty _or_ good work to extend to the spiritual _existences_ while _one_ does not make those _guardians_ satisfied, and it is not possible (mumkin) that any one _should_ repay these three persons all _their_ dues.

4\. In the commentary of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht _Nask_ it says:—Mâ âzârayôi<i>s</i>, Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! mâ Pourushaspem, mâ Dughdhôvãm, mâ aêthrapaiti<i>s</i> [^1], ‘it is nor desirable that thou, O Zaratu<i>s</i>t! _shouldest_ distress _thy_ father, _or_ mother, _or_ priest.’

5\. Therefore, three times every day it is indispensable _for one_ to fold _his_ arms [^2] in the presence of these three persons, _and_ to say:—‘What is your will (murâd)? So that I _may_ think and speak and do it. 6. If _what_ was not proper has come from me of itself, it is necessary that you make a righteous gift on our behalf.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (302:1) This Avesta passage is not known to be extant elsewhere, and its orthography has been corrected in accordance with the translation attached to it by the author of Sd. In La, Lp, J15 the first two names are in the genitive, and the third is accusative; B29 differs by putting the third name also in the genitive; the last word being accusative in all. Pourushaspa and Dughdhôva (?) were the names of the father and mother of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, and the latter name has not previously been found in the Avesta texts, but is known only from Pahlavi and Persian writings.

[^2]: (302:2) That is, to stand in an attitude of obedient reverence.
