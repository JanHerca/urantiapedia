## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘Is a blind eye worse, or a blind mind (dîl)? 3. Is the ill-informed worse, or the bad-tempered?’

4\. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'He who is blind-eyed, when he has understanding in anything, _and_ accomplishes learning, is to be considered as sound-eyed. 6. _And_ he who is sound-eyed, when he has no knowledge _and_ understanding [^1], and even that which they teach him he does not accept, then that is worse than even a blind eye.

7\. ‘The ill-tempered is less evil [^2] than the ill-informed; (8) because the ill-tempered, except by a decree, is not able to seize anything away from any one; (9) and _as to_ the ill-informed man, his desire of every kind is then [^3] for oppression and plunder. 10. Concerning him who is ill-informed _it_ is declared that, apart from predestination, he is born _free_ from fresh understanding [^4]’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (56:1) L19 has ‘when he has no knowledge of anything.’

[^2]: (56:2) L19 has ‘is better.’

[^3]: (56:3) That is, when he has a decree in his favour.

[^4]: (56:4) § 10 is found only in TD2. It probably means that an ill-informed man is not likely to acquire any knowledge beyond that which is unavoidable.
