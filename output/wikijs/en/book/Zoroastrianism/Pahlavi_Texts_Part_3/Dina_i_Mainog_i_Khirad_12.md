## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER XII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘Wherefore is _it_ when the treasure of the spiritual _existence_ is allotted so truly, _and_ that of the worldly _existence_ so falsely?’

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'The treasure of the worldly _existence_ was [^1] allotted as truly, in the original creation, as that of the spiritual _existence_. 5. And the creator, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, provided the <span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span> happiness of every kind, that is in these creatures and creation, for the use (bûn) of the sun [^2] and moon and those twelve constellations which are called the twelve chieftains [^3] by revelation; (6) and they, too, accepted _it_ in order to allot _it_ truly and deservedly.

7\. 'And, afterwards, Aharman produced those seven planets, such as are called the seven chieftains of Aharman, for dissipating [^4] _and_ carrying off that happiness from the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, in opposition to the sun and moon and those twelve constellations. 8. And _as to_ every happiness which those-constellations bestow on the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (9) those planets take away as much of it as _it_ is possible for them (the constellations) to give [^5], (10) and give _it_ up to the power of the demons [^6] and fiends and the bad.

11\. ‘And the treasure of the spiritual _existence_ is so true on this account, because Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the lord, with all the angels _and_ archangels, is [^7] undisturbed, (12) and they make the struggle with Aharman and the demons, and also the account of the souls of men, with justice. 13. And the place of _him_ whose good work is more is in heaven, (14) the place of _him_ whose good work and sin are equal is among the ever-stationary [^8], (15) and when the crime is more, his path is then to hell.’
