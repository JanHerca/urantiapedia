## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER VII.

1\. Another _subject_ is about the existence of a competitor of a different nature, as shown above [^1], (2) that, from the constructing, qualifying, _and_ ennobling of things so sagaciously, _and_ even from the circumstances of an unimproving (a<i>k</i>ârîk) hand put upon the concentrated light, _it_ is manifest that its maker, constructor, concentrator, _and_ qualifier is sagacious. 3. Also his constructing sagaciously is manifest, from each separately, through the qualifying _and_ ennobling of his own works severally. 4. And his working sagaciously is an indicator that his work is purposed _and_ caused, (5) because every one of the works of the sagacious ought to be purposed _and_ caused. 6. The purpose and cause of a work arise first, the work _itself_ afterwards.

7\. From the many kinds of his work _it_ is manifest that his work is willed and requisite. 8. For _there_ <span id="p151"><sup><small>[ p. 151 ]</small></sup></span> are two modes of doing a work, (9) either the willed is _of_ the many kinds which are his will, (to) or the quality is _of_ one kind which is as it is qualified [^1]; (11) _so_ from the many kinds _of_ work of the creator _it_ is manifest that his work is willed and requisite. 12. And his will is owing to a necessity of different limit [^2], (13) because his will _was_ a requisite for the power of the original evolution.

14\. The purpose and cause of a work are before the necessity, (15) because while the purpose of the necessity of a work does not occur, the necessity does not exist. 16. The purpose of a work arises from the cause, towards which the necessity of that work instigates. 17. The necessity _and_ willing of a thing which is caused exist; (18) and a cause of the necessity of a thing owing to its own self is not well suited, (19) because the cause arises from progression, (20) concerning which an indicator is the purposed work that is sagacious. 21. The purpose is owing to a cause, the cause is owing to promptitude (aûstâ<i>v</i>), the promptitude is owing to an exception (ba<i>r</i>â), the exception is owing to an injurer, and the injury is owing to an opponent, without _further_ words.

22\. I _have_ also shown [^3], on this subject, through inevitable knowledge and through analogy, the making and qualification of the world and its circumstances _and_ appliances. 23. From the making and qualification of the world is manifested a maker and qualifier; (24) and [^4] \[through the purposely-made <span id="p152"><sup><small>[ p. 152 ]</small></sup></span> work of the sagacious creator, (25) owing to\] the purposely-made work [^1], is manifested the existence of an injurer from without.
