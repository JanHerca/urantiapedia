## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER VI.

1\. _As to_ another delusion [^1] of those asserting the non-existence of a sacred being—(2) whom they call atheistical (daharî) [^2]—(3) that they are ordained _free_ from religious trouble (alag) and the toil of practising good works, (4) and the unlimited twaddle (drâyi<i>s</i>n) [^3] they abundantly chatter, (5) you [^4] should observe this:—6. That they account this world, with the much change and adjustment of description of its members _and_ appliances, _their_ antagonism to one another, and their confusion with one another, _as_ an original evolution [^5] of boundless time. 7. And this, too, that there is no reward of good works, no punishment of sin, no heaven and hell, and no stimulator of good works and crime. 8. Besides <span id="p147"><sup><small>[ p. 147 ]</small></sup></span> this, that things are only worldly, and there is no spirit.

9\. As I _have_ written and shown above [^6]—(10) that to be made without a maker, and decided without a decider, is as impossible as to prepare _what_ is written without a writer, _or_ a house without a mortar-mixer (râ<i>z</i>) [^7] and building (dê<i>s</i>âk)—(11) things made, of all kinds, cannot arise without making.

12\. And this worldly _existence_ is owing to the mingling of competing powers. 13. So _its_ numerous possessions are so constructed, selected, _and_ made of diverse races (<i>k</i>îharân), diverse colours, diverse scents, diverse characteristics, _and_ diverse species as I _have_ stated above [^8] about the body, (14) that it is constructed _and_ made out of many things, such as bone, fat, sinew, veins, skin, blood, breath, hair [^9], fundament [^10], hand, foot, head, belly, _and_ other members, internal and external, (15) in two series [^11] of things of many kinds, of which _to be_ never made by means of the diverse nature of diverse powers, (16) or to arise without a maker, the impossibility is certain.

17\. And _in_ like manner of the other creatures, plants _and_ trees, water _and_ fire, earth and air, their stimulus, too, which is not themselves, is to their own duty; and they are not stimulators, (18) but there is a stimulator, a building (dê<i>s</i>âk), and a making for <span id="p148"><sup><small>[ p. 148 ]</small></sup></span> them. 19. And the usage (vâzâr) which is changing _and_ urging them, from stimulus to stimulus, from statement to statement, _and_ from time to time, is not according to the will and requirement of those made, but according to those that are stimulating and making.

20\. Even so, indicative of the rotation of the years, months, days, _and_ hours, is the revolution of the _celestial_ sphere and stars which are settled (pasâkhtak), and _of_ the sun and moon which are adjusted (nîvâr<i>d</i>ak), a well-horsed [^12] progress _and_ conspicuous revolution. 21. This, too, is an indication that the movements of every appearance (<i>k</i>îharîh) are owing to an exhibitor, by whom the movement of that appearance is exhibited.

22\. Owing to other differences and different management in the worldly _existence_ (23) it is possible to know, from the worldly _existence_ at various times _and_ various periods, that this worldly _existence_ is not without a manager. 24. Or _that_ its manager is not a sacred being [^13], who is learned, acting reasonably, of unlimited power, and illumining [^14] the sky, is also that which is visible when the development, decay, and death of the world are such, that the nature alike of mankind and animals, and alike of races and trees, is to come from youth to old age, _and_ from old age to death. 25. No one whatever is seen _that has_ come from old age back to youth, _or_ from death back to life, and _it_ is not <span id="p149"><sup><small>[ p. 149 ]</small></sup></span> possible to say _so_. 26. Nor yet is it proper to think, say, _or_ believe this, (27) that there is no recompense of good works and punishment of crime, (28) nor even an appearance of an attainable creator of all the creatures, and _of_ the daubing of a destroyer.

29\. Moreover, _as to_ this _latter_, that is precious to those who are more friends of penury than _of_ the comfort of ill-famed vileness—(30) because they produce their happiness thereby [^15], and are grateful, (31) and when they see distress they become suppliants (32) even from this destiny and dispensation which cannot become spiritual except by the spirits—(33) even so, in the appearance of every one _of_ the hungry, (34) _and_ in every one hurrying and straitened [^16], who is imploring favours, is a manifestation of the maintenance of a hope for a supreme inspection over mankind, _and_, indeed, over wild animals, birds, _and_ quadrupeds.

35\. _As to_ this, too, which they call sophistical [^17]. (36) that there is no assurance of even one of _these_ things, (37) because all are jaundiced [^18]—(38) for whoever says that honey is bitter and honey is sweet, is right _in_ both, (39) since _it_ is bitter to those abounding in bile, _and_ sweet to others; (40) also bread is pleasant and bread is unpleasant are both <span id="p150"><sup><small>[ p. 150 ]</small></sup></span> true, (41) since _it_ is pleasant to the hungry, _and_ unpleasant to the surfeited; (42) _and_ many other _statements_ of this description—(43) that _which_ should be said in reply to their twaddle is summarily (44) such as the wise _have_ told them (45) thus:—‘Even this statement of you sophists, about the jaundiced nature of everything, is alike jaundiced, and there is no truth _in_ it.’

46\. Many other _things_ are said among them; (47) and this that is indicated by us is the predominant information _for_ you victors, (48) so that you _may_ obtain more from revelation.
