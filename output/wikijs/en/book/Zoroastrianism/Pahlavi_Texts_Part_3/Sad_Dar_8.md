## SAD DAR. CHAPTER VIII.

1\. The eighth subject is this, that it is necessary to maintain the religion by rule (dastûr), and to practise obedience to the commands of the high-priests; _and_ every duty that _people_ perform they _should_ perform by their authority.

2\. For it is declared in the good religion, that, if they accomplish as many good works as the leaves of the trees, _or_ the sand_\-grains_ of the desert, _or_ the drops (qa<i>t</i>rah) of rain, which they do not perform by command of the high-priests, _or_ to their satisfaction, no merit whatever attains to their souls, and _for_ the good works they have done they obtain sin _as_ a recompense. 3. While _such a one_ is living it is not proper to call him righteous, and when he dies he does not attain to heaven, and not a single archangel comes [^1] near him. 4. He does not make his escape from the hands of the demons and Aharman, and he <span id="p267"><sup><small>[ p. 267 ]</small></sup></span> does not obtain a release from hell. 5. Because duties _and_ good works [^2] attain to the soul _on_ those occasions when they perform _them_ with the authority of the high-priests and those acquainted with the religion, and _when_ they give them one-tenth of those good works [^3].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (266:4) Lp, B29 have ‘goes.’

[^2]: (267:1) That is, the merit of performing them.

[^3]: (267:2) The principles of blind submission of the laity to the priesthood, and complete abnegation of private judgment, which pervade the whole of the Sad Dar, are especially conspicuous in this chapter. They are the ideas prevalent in the darkest ages of the religion, which have now nearly disappeared with the spread of true knowledge as in other faiths.
