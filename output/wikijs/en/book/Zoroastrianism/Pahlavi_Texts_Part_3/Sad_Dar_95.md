## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XCV.

1\. The ninety-fifth subject is this, that it is necessary that it be expedient for all those of the <span id="p358"><sup><small>[ p. 358 ]</small></sup></span> good religion to perform the salutation of the sun [^1] three times every day.

2\. If _one_ performs _it_ once, it is a good work of one Tanâvar [^2]; if he performs _it_ twice, it is twice as much; _and_ if he performs _it_ three times, it is thrice as much. 3. And if he does not perform one repetition, it is a sin of thirty stîrs [^3]; if he does not perform two repetitions, it is twice as much sin; and if he does not perform three repetitions, it is thrice as much sin.

4\. And it is the same as this with regard to _the salutations of_ the moon and fire [^4]. 5. Therefore it is expedient, in the religion, for every one of the good religion to bring the salutations _into_ practice.
