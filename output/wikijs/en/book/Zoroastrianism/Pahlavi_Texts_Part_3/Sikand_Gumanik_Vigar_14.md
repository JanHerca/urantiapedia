## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER XIV.

1\. My desire is also that I write a story (nisang-1) out of the accompanying inconsistency and full delusion of the same scripture, (2) that is full of every iniquity and demonism; and I _will_ disclose a summary of one _part_ out of a thousand of _what is_ declared thereby, (3) _so as_ to notice the commands therein.

4\. First, this is what he says about his own nature, (5) that is, ‘I am the Lord, seeking vengeance (6) and retaliating vengeance [^1], (7) and I retaliate vengeance sevenfold upon the children [^2], (8) and _one_ does not forget my original vengeance.’ (9). Another place states that, '_having_ acquired [^3] wrath and grievous thoughts, (10) his lips are also full of indignation [^4], (11) _his_ tongue is like a blazing fire, (12) and _his_ breath (vâyâ) is like a river of rapid water (arvand nâk) [^5]. 13. His voice, too, as though for causing <span id="p222"><sup><small>[ p. 222 ]</small></sup></span> weeping, is more resembling the shouting of a demon [^1], (14) and his seat is in the gloom [^2], the dew, and the cloud [^3]. 15. His charger, also, is the drying (khû<i>s</i>kâk) wind [^4], (16) and from the motion of his feet is the arising of a whirlwind of dust [^5]. 17. When he walks the arising of fire is behind him [^6].

18\. And, elsewhere, he speaks about his own wrathfulness, (19) thus: ‘I have been forty years in wrath about the Israelites [^7],’ (20) and he said that the Israelites are defiled in heart [^8].

21\. Elsewhere he speaks thus: ‘Who is blind [^9], <span id="p223"><sup><small>[ p. 223 ]</small></sup></span> unless _it be_ my servant? 22. Who is deaf [^1], but the messenger (firîstak) I am appointing? 23. Who is blind like the king [^2]?’ _And it is_ declared that their king is the Lord himself [^3].

24\. Elsewhere it also says this, that the worshippers (parastakân) of his fire are defiled [^4]. 25. Also this, that his deeds bring blinding smoke, (26) _and his_ fighting is the shedding of blood [^5]. 27. And this, that is, ‘I pour forth mankind one upon the other, (28) _and_ I sit upon the sky, over their limbs.’ 29. Likewise this, that, in one night, a hundred _and_ sixty thousand _were_ slain by him, through a wretched death, out of the champions and troops of the Mâzerdarâns [^6]. 30. And, _on_ another occasion, he slew six hundred thousand men, besides women and young children, out of the Israelites in the wilderness; (31) only two men escaped [^7]. <span id="p224"><sup><small>[ p. 224 ]</small></sup></span> 32\. Again, it shows that his final result is all regret, (33) just as this which it states, that he became among the despondent (zardakân), and he spoke thus: ‘I am repentant as to the making of men on the earth [^1].’

34\. This, too, it states, that he sits upon a throne which four angels hold upon _their_ wings, from each one of whom a fiery river always proceeds, owing to the load of _his_ weight [^2]. 35. Now, when he is a spirit, not formed with a body, why then are those four distressed by him, who _have_ to sustain with toil the grievous load of that easy _thing?_

36\. Again, _it states_ this, that every day he prepares, with his own hand, ninety thousand worshippers, and they always worship him until he night time, and then he dismisses them, through a fiery river, to hell [^3]. 37. When trouble and injustice of this description are seen, how is it <span id="p225"><sup><small>[ p. 225 ]</small></sup></span> expedient _for_ worldly beings to exist in duty, good works, and good deeds? 38. When he casts distressed worshippers who are reverent, listening to commands, _and_ pure in action, together with others _who are_ sinners, into eternal hell, (39) _it is_ like even that which another congregation [^1] asserts, that the sacred being, _at_ the day of the resurrection, gives the sun and moon, together with others _who are_ sinners, to hell for the reason that there are people who _have_ offered homage to them.

40\. Another place also states this, that when the eyes of the aged (masâtval) [^2] Abraham, who _was_ the friend of the Lord, were afflicted, the Lord himself came enquiring for him; (41) and he sat _on_ his cushion and asked for peace [^3]. 42. And Abraham called Isaac [^4], who _was_ his dearest son [^5], in secret, _and_ spoke (43) thus: ‘Go to paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t), _and_ bring wine that is light and pure.’ 44. _And_ he went and brought it. 45. And Abraham made many entreaties to the Lord (46) thus: ‘Taste one time [^6] wine in my abode.’ 47. _And_ the Lord spoke thus: <span id="p226"><sup><small>[ p. 226 ]</small></sup></span> ‘I _will_ not taste _it_, because _it_ is not from paradise, and is not pure.’ 48. Then Abraham gave assurance thus: ‘The wine is pure from paradise, and Isaac, who is my son, brought _it_.’ 49. Thereupon the Lord, _on account of_ his freedom from doubt in Isaac, and the assurance _given_ by Abraham, tasted the wine one time. 50. Afterwards, when he wished to go, _he was_ not allowed until one of them _had_ sworn _to_ the other by a serious oath [^1].

51\. Observe this twaddle full of delusion; not even a single _detail_ is adapted to a sacred being. 52. In what way _was_ his coming in bodily form to the abode of Abraham and eating bread, of which not even a single _detail_ is adapted to him? 53. This, too, is evident, from it, that the suffering of Abraham was not [^2] from the Lord, but from another producer. 54. And even the faultiness [^3] which _was_ owing to his want of understanding of knowledge was such, that the purity of the wine and whence _it came_ were not known by him. 55. His falsity is also _seen in_ this, when he spoke of not drinking the wine, and _at_ last drank _it_. 56. Afterwards he is confessing that it is genuine _and_ pure. 57. Now, how is he worthy of worship, as a divinity that is all-knowing _and_ almighty, whose nature is this?

58\. And another place states that _there_ was one of the sick who, with his own wife and child, _was_ <span id="p227"><sup><small>[ p. 227 ]</small></sup></span> particularly _one_ that was suffering, poor, _and_ without a stipend. 59. _At_ all times he was very diligent and active in prayer and fasting and the worship of the sacred being. 60. And one day, in prayer, he secretly begged a favour thus: ‘Give me any enjoyment that is in daily food (rô<i>z</i>îh), (61) that it may be easier for me to live.’

62\. And an angel came down unto him _and_ spoke thus: ‘The sacred being has not allotted thee, through the constellations [^1], more daily food than this, (63) _and_ it is not possible to allot anew; (64) but, as a recompense for worship _and_ prayer, a throne whose four feet are of jewels is appointed for thee in heaven (vahi<i>s</i>t) by me, (65) _and_, if it be necessary, I _will_ give unto thee one foot of that throne.’

66\. That exalter of the apostles enquired of his own wife, (67) _and_ the unfortunate _one_ spoke thus: '_It is_ better for us to be content with the scanty daily food and bad living in the worldly _existence_, (68) than if our throne, among _our_ companions in heaven, _had_ three feet; (69) but if it may occur to thee then appoint us a day's food by another mode.'

70\. _At_ the second coming of that angel he spoke thus: ‘But if I dissipate the _celestial_ sphere, and produce the sky _and_ earth anew, and construct and produce the motion of the stars anew, _still_ thenceforth _it_ is not clear whether thy destiny _will_ fall _out_ good or bad [^2].’

71\. From this statement _it_ is, therefore, manifest that he is not himself the appointer of daily food and supreme, (72) distribution is not by his will, <span id="p228"><sup><small>[ p. 228 ]</small></sup></span> _he is_ not able to alter destiny, (73) and the revolution of the _celestial_ sphere, the sun _and_ moon and stars, is not within the compass of his knowledge, will, and command. 74. _And_ also this, that the throne, as to which _it was_ announced (nivîkînî<i>d</i>) thus: ‘I _will_ give _it_ in heaven,’ is not of his formation and creation.

75\. And _in_ another place he speaks about his own twaddle (76) thus: ‘I _have_ slain, _in_ one day [^1], an assemblage (ram) of sinners, as well as innumerable innocents.’ 77. _And_ when the angels talked much of the unreasonable performance, he then spoke of it thus: ‘I am the Lord, the ruler of wills, (78) superintending, unrivalled, and doing _my own_ will, and no one assists _or_ is to utter a murmur (dren<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) about me [^2].’

79\. Especially abundant is the twaddle that is completely delusive, which _has_ seemed to me tedious to write. 80. Whoever would investigate the backward opinions of these statements, should be, for that purpose of his, a high-priest speaking candidly (â<i>z</i>â<i>d</i>), (81) until he becomes aware of the nature of the same scripture, and _of_ the truth of that which is stated by me.

82\. Now if he _be_ a sacred being, of whom these are signs and tokens, that _implies that_ truth is far from him, (83) forgiveness strange to him, (84) and knowledge is not bestowed upon him. 85. Because this itself is the fiend who is leader of the hell which <span id="p229"><sup><small>[ p. 229 ]</small></sup></span> is the den (grêstak) of the gloomy race, (86) whom the devilish defiled _ones and_ evil _people_ glorify by the name of the Lord, and offer _him_ homage.

87\. About this subject is here complete.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (221:1) ‘To me _belongeth_ vengeance, and recompence’ (Deut. xxxii. 35). Or, as it is quoted in Rom. xii. 19, ‘Vengeance _is_ mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.’

[^2]: (221:2) ‘Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold’ (Gen. iv. 15).

[^3]: (221:3) Perhaps ayâftak is a misreading of âshuftak, ‘distracted _by_.’

[^4]: (221:4) Literally ‘venom.’

[^5]: (221:5) ‘Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from far, burning _with_ his anger, and the burden _thereof_ is heavy; his lips are full of p. 222 indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: and his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck’ (Is. xxx. 27, 28).

[^1]: (222:1) ‘And the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of _his_ anger, and _with_ the flame of a devouring fire, _with_ scattering, and tempest, and hailstones’ (Is. xxx. 30).

[^2]: (222:2) Assuming that Pâz. gûam (Pers. gum, ‘invisible’) is a misreading of Pahl. tom, ‘gloom,’ as the Sanskrit is dhûmalatvam, ‘smokiness.’

[^3]: (222:3) ‘He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him _were_ dark waters _and_ thick clouds of the skies’ (Ps. xviii. 11). ‘Clouds and darkness _are_ round about him’ (Ps. xcvii. 2).

[^4]: (222:4) ‘Who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind’ (Ps. civ. 3).

[^5]: (222:5) ‘The Lord _hath_ his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds _are_ the dust of his feet’ (Na. i. 3).

[^6]: (222:6) ‘For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire’ (Is. lxvi. 15).

[^7]: (222:7) Pâz. Asarâsarã is evidently a misreading of Pahl. Asrâyîlân.

[^8]: (222:8) ‘Forty years long was I grieved with _this_ generation, and said, “It _is_ a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways;” unto whom I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest’ (Ps. xcv. 10, 11).

[^9]: (222:9) Sans. has ‘whoever is needy,’ both here and in § 23.

[^1]: (223:1) Sans. has ‘whoever is prosperous.’

[^2]: (223:2) 'Who _is_ blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger _that_ I sent? who _is_ blind as _he that is_ perfect, and blind as the Lord's servant?' (Is. xlii. 19).

[^3]: (223:3) ‘The Lord _is_ our king’ (Is. xxxiii. 22).

[^4]: (223:4) ‘About five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. Then he said unto me, “Hast thou seen _this_, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here?”’ (Eze. viii. 16, 17).

[^5]: (223:5) ‘And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai’ (Jos. viii. 21).

[^6]: (223:6) ‘Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses’ (Is. xxxvii. 36).

[^7]: (223:7) ‘And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot, _that were_ men, beside p. 224 children’ (Ex. xii. 37). ‘Doubtless ye shall not come into the land _concerning_ which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. . . . But _as for_ you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness’ (Num. xiv. 30, 30.

[^1]: (224:1) ‘And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth’ (Gen. vi. 6).

[^2]: (224:2) ‘Also out of the midst thereof _came_ the likeness of four living creatures. . . . Their wings _were_ joined one to another. . . . As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance _was_ like burning coals of fire, _and_ like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures. . . . And under the firmament _were_ their wings straight, the one toward the other. . . . And above the firmament that _was_ over their heads _was_ the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne _was_ the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it’ (Eze. i. 5, 9, 13, 23, 26). ‘A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him’ (Dan. vii. 10).

[^3]: (224:3) This statement may possibly be quoted from the Talmud.

[^1]: (225:1) Probably the Christians, and referring to such texts as ‘The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come’ (Acts ii. 20).

[^2]: (225:2) Nêr. reads this word as a title, Mehâdar, of Abraham. It is, however, the Huzvâri<i>s</i> of dâ<i>d</i>\-mas (for dâ<i>d</i>\-î mas, ‘great age’), and appears to be a hybrid form, the first syllable being Iranian and the latter portion Semitic.

[^3]: (225:3) Upon his host; the usual Oriental salutation.

[^4]: (225:4) Nêr. has read Âsînak, which indicates a Pahlavi form that might be read Aîsôk, and points to Syr. ’Îs‘hoq as the original of this form of Isaac.

[^5]: (225:5) Sans. has 'his whole-blood brother's son.'

[^6]: (225:6) Assuming that Pâz. shê stands for Pahl. gâs-1, both here and in § 49. Nêr. seems to have understood it as Ar. <i>s</i>ay, ‘somewhat.’

[^1]: (226:1) This tale is perhaps to be sought in the Talmud.

[^2]: (226:2) Reading lâ instead of râî. By reading the latter Nêr. has ‘the suffering, which _was_ for Abraham, was from the Lord,’ which is inconsistent with the context.

[^3]: (226:3) Assuming that Pâz. bavãnî (Sans. vaikalyam) stands for Pahl. zîfânîh, which seems more probable than supposing it to be a miswriting of Pâz. d<i>e</i>wãnagî, ‘folly.’

[^1]: (227:1) Of the zodiac (see Mkh. XII, 5, 6, 8).

[^2]: (227:2) This tale is probably from the same source as the last.

[^1]: (228:1) Assuming that Pâz. zumaê is a corruption of <i>g</i>umê (see Chap. IV, 101 n) and stands for Huz. yôm-1. But it may mean ‘the whole of.’

[^2]: (228:2) This seems to be quoted from the same source as the two preceding tales.
