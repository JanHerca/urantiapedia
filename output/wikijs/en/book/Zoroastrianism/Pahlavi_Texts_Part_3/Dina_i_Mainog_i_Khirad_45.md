## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER XLV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘By what does Aharman most deceive and lead people to hell? 3. And from what is his pleasure most? 4. Where is the place he has a foundation? <span id="p88"><sup><small>[ p. 88 ]</small></sup></span> 5. Where, also, is his coming, _together_ with the demons, most? 6. And from what is his food?’

7\. The spirit of wisdom answered (8) thus: Aharman deceives people most by prosperity and adversity [^1], the fiend of apostasy, scepticism, and covetousness. 9. His pleasure, also, is most from the discord of men. 10. And his food is from the impenitence [^2] and reticence of men. 11. He has a foundation in the malicious [^3]. 12. And his coming and going are most with the wrathful.'
