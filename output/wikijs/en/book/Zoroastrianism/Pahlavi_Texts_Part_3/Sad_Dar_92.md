## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XCII.

1\. The ninety-second subject is this, that it is necessary to properly maintain the sacred fire [^4] and some one who _will_ work with assiduity (kandân) to provide [^5] maintenance and sympathy for it. 2. And the supply of its firewood is entirely _in_ such a manner that they burn this year the firewood of last year [^6]. 3. _At_ midnight they make _it_ blaze up, _and_ put incense upon _it in_ such a manner that the wind carries off its scent.

4\. The demons and fiends rush away, because there is the glory of the sacred fire that we are able to make a living existence in the midst of this <span id="p356"><sup><small>[ p. 356 ]</small></sup></span> people. 5. For, if no fiend [^1] and the glory of the archangels and the day of the sacred fire had not existed, it would not have been possible to produce the living existence any day. 6. And, therefore, it makes _it_ expedient that they supply a fire-attendant to maintain the firewood and fire, so that a seeking for _its_ safety (’hâfiyat) _may_ come into _operation_, and they _may_ know a support and protection for it that would be acceptable.

## Footnotes

[^4]: (355:4) Literally ‘the fire of Bahirâm.’ Compare Chap. XXXIX.

[^5]: (355:5) Lp, B29, J15 have ‘so that some one _may_ keep watch over it, and is to provide proper.’

[^6]: (355:6) So that it may be quite dry, as to put anything damp into a fire would be considered sinful (see AV. X, 6-24).

[^1]: (356:1) That is, the absence of fiends. B29 has ‘if the splendour.’
