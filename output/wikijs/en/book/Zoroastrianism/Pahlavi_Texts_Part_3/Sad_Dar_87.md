## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXXXVII.

1\. The eighty-seventh subject is this, that, when <span id="p351"><sup><small>[ p. 351 ]</small></sup></span> any one departs from the world [^1], it is necessary to make an effort, in those three days, so that they _may_ continuously perform the ceremonial of Srôsh [^2] and make the fire blaze, and _may_ recite the Avesta; because the soul is three days in this world [^3].

2\. The fourth night it is requisite to consecrate three sacred cakes; one _with_ a dedication _to_ Rashn [^4] and Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i> [^5], one _with_ a dedication _to_ the spirit Râm [^6], _and_ one _with_ a dedication to the righteous guardian spirit; _and one is_ to consecrate a dress and something _as_ a righteous gift for that soul [^7].

3\. It is necessary that the dress be new and of uniform quality (<i>g</i>ins), and such as turban, shirt, vest, girdle, trowsers, shoes (pasandil) [^8], and mouth-veil. 4. Since they give those among the spirits a counterpart of those garments, therefore, whatever is more beautiful, _and_ more surpassing _in_ grandeur for the soul _in_ that place, is necessary where that place is, because our fathers and mothers and the whole of _our_ relations are _in_ that place. 5. _And_ since the souls recognise and ask after one another in that world, they are, therefore, more joyful on account of every one whose dress [^9] and grandeur are more surpassing. 6. In a similar manner, when the dress is old and ragged, they are ashamed, and exhibit heaviness of heart. <span id="p352"><sup><small>[ p. 352 ]</small></sup></span> 7\. They call that dress a righteous gift because they consecrate _it_; and it is necessary to give _it to_ the priests and high-priests, as it is a righteous gift on account of their position. 8. And it is suitable for them to keep _it_ for the reason that the souls are nearer to them; _people should also_ make an effort that the dress may be stitched like the dress of a priest.

9\. The sacred beings make up the account _and_ reckoning for the soul when the priest recites frasasti ahurahê mazd<i>a</i>u [^10] and removes the Frasast [^11] from this side to that side. 10. The soul passes over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge when, _on_ the fourth night, it arrives from the world _at_ the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge. 11. First it goes to the abode of fire (âta<i>s</i>\-gâh) [^12]; afterwards, one step reaches to the star station, the second step reaches to the moon station, the third step to the sun station, _and_ with the fourth step it reaches the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge [^13], _and_ they convey it to its own place.
