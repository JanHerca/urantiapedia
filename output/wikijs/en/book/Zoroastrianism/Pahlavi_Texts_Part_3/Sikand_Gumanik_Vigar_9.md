## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER IX.

1\. Other information about the existence of the competitor, similarly testified by the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> [^2] manuscript (nipîk), is here well noted for you. 2. For both this _which is_ written above and that which is written _here_ are all grown from the seed which the glorified Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>îyâvand sowed, (3) and _from_ the original thanksgiving (spâs) of the supremely learned Âtû<i>r</i>\-frôbag, son of Farukh-zâ<i>d</i>, himself.

4\. The fourth [^3] subject, which is from the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, is about the existence of an opponent of the creatures and of an opponent earlier than the creatures, and is from the exposition of the good religion [^4]. <span id="p163"><sup><small>[ p. 163 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. _That_ is, a knowledge of the existence of an opponent of the creatures is obtainable from the innermost _recesses_ of the body of man even to the outermost _objects_ of which [^1] sight is susceptible, (6) and beyond those, within the certain limits of analogy. 7. The innermost _recesses_ of man are the innermost of life, (8) _and_ are seen through complete observation, within the same limits.

9\. This is, as ignorance is to erudition, (10) deceit to good disposition, (11) and falsehood to truth, (12) other defects of the capabilities which are the source of erudition, good disposition, and truth are the opponent, (13) and the cause of the wickedness of the soul. 14. Again, these irregularities of the rules of arrangement of the body, within the compass of the body, are the opponent, and the cause of the disintegration of the body. 15. Again, _as to_ these among the emanations, cold is the opponent of heat, dryness is of moisture, _and_ the other doers of mischief are _opponents_ of the operations of existence.

16\. Within time darkness is the opponent of light, stench of perfume, ugliness of handsomeness, unsavouriness of savouriness, poison of _its_ antidote, noxious creatures and the wolf of the well-yielding cattle, _and_ the vile felon (mar) of the good man. 17. Beyond time the brigand _planets_ (gadûgân) [^2] are the opponents of the work of the divine bestowers.

18\. Beyond the knowledge obtainable of all these <span id="p164"><sup><small>[ p. 164 ]</small></sup></span> champions susceptible to sight, are those who are within the limits of analogy [^1] and the certain information of multitudes, the demons who are the opponents of the sacred beings.

19\. The existence of an opponent before the creation of the creatures, and his coming to the creatures (20) after, the creation of the creatures, _and_ also to the creator, are presented comprehensibly through reasons which are suitable [^2] _and_ presentable, _and_ through the provision of a remedy, a creation which is for a purpose. 21. This one statement (vâ<i>k</i>ak) possesses five arguments (sâmân). 22. One is the _being_ presented comprehensibly. 23. One is the _being_ presented through reasons. 24. One is the reasons which are presentable _and_ suitable that the creation existed. 25. One is the remedy appointed for the creation. 26. _And_ one is the creation of the creatures of the creator for a purpose.

27\. The existence of these five arguments is manifest through the creations _and_ achievements themselves. 28. The presenting comprehensibly is wisely arranging the testimony of the effect [^3] of the creatures, (29) through the reasons presented, which are a declaration owing to the same sagacity. 30. The reason obtainable, that the creation existed, (31) with the arrangement of the creation so methodically, ought to arise from the suitable _state_ of the <span id="p165"><sup><small>[ p. 165 ]</small></sup></span> creation; (32) and the suitable design of the creation itself possesses the testimony, through _its_ appearance. 33. The remedy appointed is a comprehensible _and_ presentable demonstrator, (34) because it becomes a desire of knowledge and an appearance of the desire. 35. The _being_ created for a purpose is manifest through the desire of activity of the creation, both severally and naturally.

36\. The evidences of the existence of an opponent before the creation of the creatures are many. 37. And one of them is the suitable _state_ of the creation of the creatures, (38) because the limit of suitability is not well fitted for anything except necessity. (39) That _which_ is _inferred_ from suitability is necessity, from necessity haste, _and_ from haste the existence of an opponent who is before the suitable work which is the creation.

40\. The evidence of the coming of the destroyer to the creatures, after the creation of the creatures, is the formation of the means of the creator, for encountering an opponent, before the arrival of the opponent, (41) which are omnisciently a provision before creation by the creator. 42. And there is a demonstrator of _these_ same means of the creatures that is prepared, which is the struggling opposed to the opponent through the arrangement of _their_ nature. 43. One duty of the nature of the creatures is the subduing of so much vexation. 44. Their preparation, too, is like a contest that is forming an enemy opposing the opponent, (45) and their natural desire for duty is removing all haste.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (162:2) See Chap. IV, 106, 107 for the names in these §§ 1, 2.

[^3]: (162:3) Assuming that Pâz. ardium (Sans. balish_th_o me) is a misreading of Pahl. arbâûm. The first subject (see Chap: II, 1) consisted of the three questions of Mit<i>r</i>ô-aîyyâr discussed in Chaps. II-IV. The second subject, about the existence of God, is contained in Chaps. V, VI. And the third subject, about the existence of an evil spirit competing with the creator, is debated in Chaps. VII, VIII.

[^4]: (162:4) The third book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, which treats of a multitude of subjects ‘from the exposition of the good religion,’ does not appear p. 163 to contain the materials for this chapter. The author is, therefore, probably alluding to one of the two earlier books which have not yet been discovered.

[^1]: (163:1) Assuming that Pâz. a<i>n</i>dâ n<i>e</i> (for b<i>e</i>) thûm-i va<i>s</i> (Sans. yâvat bî<i>g</i>am asya) stands for Pahl. vad ba<i>r</i>âtûm-î a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>.

[^2]: (163:2) See Chap. IV, 10.

[^1]: (164:1) Referring to the two kinds of evidence, direct and indirect, mentioned in §§ 5, 6.

[^2]: (164:2) So in § 24 and in Sans., though Pâz. has ‘obtainable’ here.

[^3]: (164:3) Assuming that the Pâz. awar dugâê of AK stands for Pahl. bar gôkâs (or gôkâsîh). MH19 has duvâê, and PB3, JE have dusâê, while Sans. means ‘about the magnitude.’
