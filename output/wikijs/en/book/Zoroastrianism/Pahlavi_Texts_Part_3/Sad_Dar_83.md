## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXXXIII.

1\. The eighty-third subject is this, that it is requisite to abstain from the keeping of fasts. 2. For, in our religion, it is not proper that they _should_ not eat every day _or_ anything, because it would be a sin _not to do so_.

3\. With us the keeping of fast is this, that we keep fast from committing sin with _our_ eyes and tongue and ears and hands and feet. 4. Some people are striving about it, so that they _may_ not eat anything all day, and they practise abstinence from eating anything. 5. For us it is also necessary to make an effort, so that we _may_ not think, _or_ speak, _or_ commit any sin; and it is necessary that no bad action _should_ proceed from our hands, _or_ tongue, _or_ ears, _or_ feet, which would be a sin owing to them.

6\. Since I have spoken _in_ this manner, and have brought forward the fasting of the seven members of the body, that which, in other religions, is fasting owing to not eating is, in our religion, fasting owing to not committing sin.
