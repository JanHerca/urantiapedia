## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER VIII.

1\. Again, about the existence of a competing _and_ different original evolution [^1], _there_ are these (2) that are manifest from the good and evil which are in the world, (3) and the particulars of _its_ good maker which are self-limited. 4. Such as darkness and light, (5) erudition _and_ ignorance, (6) perfume and stench, (7) life and death, (8) sickness and health, (9) order (dâ<i>d</i>) and disorder, (10) distress and freedom from care (â<i>z</i>â<i>d</i>îh), (11) _and_ other co-existing [^2] factors whose certain existence is visible in every district _and_ land, and every age. 12. So that no district _or_ land whatever is discovered, nor yet any age _has_ existed _or_ shall exist, (13) wherein these good and bad terms and particulars _have_ not existed _or_ do not exist. 14. And it is not possible to say, as to any place _or_ age, that good and evil are changeable in themselves by their own nature.

15\. So, moreover, of the other co-existences whose difference is not through different duty, through different species, _or_ through different quality—(16) as the difference of those of a like nature among one another, such as male _and_ female, (17) _of_ the varieties <span id="p153"><sup><small>[ p. 153 ]</small></sup></span> of scents _and_ flavours, and _of_ the sun _and_ moon _and_ stars, whose difference is not through different nature, but through different duty, through different qualification, and through different construction, which are such as are attainable for various duties—(18) the good and evil, light and dark, _and_ other different natures are then their distinction not through different duty, but through different nature, (19) the incompatible quality and the injuriousness which are manifest _in_ them, one towards the other. 20. Therefore, when good is there [^3], the non-existence of evil is unquestionable; (21) when light _has_ come, darkness is removed. 22. Even so _of_ the other co-existences [^4] whose incompatibility and injuriousness together are owing to the cause of difference of nature, (23) because, in the worldly _existence, there_ is a manifestation of the competing nature and injuriousness of the things, one towards the other.

24\. The worldly _existence_ is the fruit of the spiritual, and the spiritual is its root, (25) because fruit is obtained through a root. 26. _In_ like manner the giver of the evidence arisen among the intelligent is clear. 27. Of the worldly _existence being_ the fruit, _and_ the spiritual being the root, the evidence is this, (28) when the progress (ma<i>d</i>anŏ) of every visible _and_ tangible thing from imperceptibility to perceptibility is explicitly manifest. 29. Because the arising of mankind and other creatures, <span id="p154"><sup><small>[ p. 154 ]</small></sup></span> who are visible _and_ tangible, from a spiritual _existence_ which is invisible _and_ intangible is known, (30) as much as the mirrored length _and_ breadth of the body _being_ an emanation of itself. 31. And the perceptibility of the body of man and other creatures was imperceptible _and_ invisible in the semen which is _derived_ from _their_ fathers; (32) the semen itself, too, came into perceptibility, visibility, _and_ tangibility in the skin [^5] of the fathers.

33\. It is now possible to know inevitably [^6] that this worldly _existence_, which is visible _and_ tangible, is produced _and_ has arisen from a spiritual _existence_ which is invisible _and_ intangible. 34. _In_ like manner the lapsing (yehevûntanŏ) from visibility _and_ tangibility into invisibility _and_ intangibility [^7], which are themselves a spiritual _state_, is unquestionable.

35\. When _these_ are seen by us, in the worldly _existence_, the competing nature, formation, and injuriousness of one towards the other, even as to the property of the spiritual _existence_, (36) which is the root of the worldly _one_; (37) and, _in_ like manner, _there_ is no doubt of the existence of its fruit of worldly possessions; (38) this is that which is manifest as regards a competing nature. 39. Then [^8] its purpose and cause _were_ indicated by me above [^9], which are the sagaciously working of the creator, (40) who created the creature which is an indicator of the existence _of_ an opponent. <span id="p155"><sup><small>[ p. 155 ]</small></sup></span> 41\. For _it_ is known that work due to workers is _of_ two kinds, designed or qualified. 42. That which is designed is _of_ three kinds. 43. Two are due to the wise _and_ sagacious; (44) either through seeking for their own working of advantage and benefit, (45) or _through_ removing _and_ keeping away the harm and evil which are from without. 46. And one is due to the ignorant _and_ unwise, (47) _done_ defectively _and_ without a purpose. 48. From the wise _and_ sagacious, work ought [^10] not to arise without a purpose _and_ without a cause.

49\. As the sagacious creator, who is all-knowing, perfectly capable, _and_ fully complete in his own self, _has_ sought that which is not a necessity for any advantage and aggrandizement of his from without [^11], (50) it is, therefore, necessary to understand that the purpose _and_ causes of his works are _of_ that one kind [^12], (51) to remove _and_ keep away the harm which is due to his opponent and the injurer who may arise from without, which is itself the purpose and cause of the creation of the creatures. 52. Also this, that that sagacious creator is good-willed, (53) and his will is all goodness. 54. The creatures _were_ also created by him predominantly of his own will. 55. And the completely-stirring desire of him who is good-willed _and_ sagacious is to subdue [^13] evil _and_ make _it_ extinct, (56) for while evil is not subdued the <span id="p156"><sup><small>[ p. 156 ]</small></sup></span> will of him who is good-willed is not fulfilled. 57. _And_ this, that the goodness of that sagacious creator is manifest from creativeness, cherishing, and protection, _and from_ commanding _and_ teaching the means of putting away the path of evil and causing forbearance from crime; (58) also from the qualities and powers of the body in pain and sickness from without.

59\. And, as a cause of the body, (60) to remove and keep away the opponent who comes to the body, _and to be_ the maintenance, the cause of maturity, and the cause of growth of animals _and_ sprouting plants [^14], through the power of maintaining _and_ cherishing _their_ qualities, _there_ is a co-operator who is scripturally called the Fravash [^15]. 61. And through those four powers that are accumulative, which are the powers of attracting, seizing, digesting, _and_ extracting—(62) and which, owing to the creator's sagacity of every kind, are co-operators with proportionate power for keeping away the pain and sickness of various kinds which are owing to the opponent, who is working defectively _and_ desirous of evil—(63) and _through_ others _that_ are of like strength _and_ auxiliary, the good will of the creator is manifest. <span id="p157"><sup><small>[ p. 157 ]</small></sup></span> 64\. Of this, too, that this _one_ is no creator of the pain and death which are dissipaters of the body, who is good-willed _and_ a maintainer and cherisher of the body, (65) the evidence is even from this, when the sagacious creator is not a sufferer from sorrow (apakhshadâr) and performing penitence, (66) and is no dissipater and disabler of his own achievements [^16], (67) because _he_ is sagacious and all-knowing.

68\. _As to_ this _other and_ the sorrow _and_ penitence of the kind which is owing to his own work, it is fitting to speak about him _as_ of deficient knowledge, incomplete wisdom, and inconclusive understanding. 69. As work does not arise from the wise and sagacious without a purpose _and_ without a cause [^17], (70) _in_ like manner work from the unwise _and_ ignorant _and_ those of inconclusive understanding is all defective, without a purpose, _and_ without a cause [^18]. 71. And that sagacious _one_ is a contriver, working sagaciously _and_ methodically, for keeping away that defective work and inconclusive understanding from his own creatures.

72\. He who is working defectively produced distorted [^19] _and_ entangled scriptures among the creatures; (73) because this is known, that it is not possible so to keep away _and_ cramp [^20] him who is a moving _and_ living nature in a boundless void, _and_ <span id="p158"><sup><small>[ p. 158 ]</small></sup></span> to become without risk of injury [^21]. 74. But, though he does not become entangled, fenced in, and captive, (75) _he_ is spreading anguish into the entanglement and captivity, and _it_ is a means of grievous punishment. 76. Only while a complete wiping away of the anguish _due to_ him, and complete information as to his own ignorant activity do not arise, he _has_ meditated [^22] with lying falsehood on that which is connected therewith. 77. And the complete capability of the almighty creator is the wiping away of the anguish.

78\. Owing to the complete wiping away of anguish, through the almightiness of the sagacious creator, he casts _him_ back impotent into the boundless void. 79. _And_ the good creatures thereby become fearless, immortal, _and_ undistressed (80) _through_ the completely methodical sagacity and discernment of means of that omniscient creator of good beings.

81\. From observation of possessions the difference of things is manifest. 82. And the difference is _of_ two kinds, as mentioned above [^23]. 83. One is difference of operation, and the other is difference of nature. 84. Difference of operation is owing to mutual assistance and united strength [^24], (85) and difference of nature is owing to want of an adapter <span id="p159"><sup><small>[ p. 159 ]</small></sup></span> and _to_ opposition. 86. And not in a single place is a permanence of possessions manifest.

87\. If one of anything shall exist _and_ one does not exist, _its_ name shall exist, (88) for the sake of recognising things, one from the other, and preserving the name. 89. The bad, by separation from the good existence, is originally evolved _in_ such a manner that the one is really no cause of the other. 90. Because each one is existent (aît-hômand) through its own self, (91) owing to the perpetual injury _and_ antagonism which are manifestly theirs, one towards the other.

92\. If any one shall say that, as the competing _formations_ of the competitors are numerous—(93) such as good _and_ evil, dark _and_ light, perfume _and_ stench, life _and_ death, sickness _and_ health, pleasure _and_ vexation—(94) there ought to be many other such original evolutions, many _in_ number and of many species; (95) then they _may_ give this reply [^25], (96) that, even when _there_ are many names and many species of competitors, still then all are within the compass [^26] of two names. 97. And these two names are their including-source, which are good and evil. 98. Their different names and different species are tokens of these two sources.

99\. _There_ is nothing whatever that is not _in_ the compass of these two names. 100. _There has_ not been and _will_ not be anything which is not good or evil, or a mixture of both. 101. On which account <span id="p160"><sup><small>[ p. 160 ]</small></sup></span> _it_ is explicitly manifest that the original evolutions are two, _and_ not more; (102) _and_ also this, that it is not possible _for_ good to arise from evil, and evil from good.

103\. From this, too, it is possible to understand [^27], (104) that it is not possible _for_ complete evil to arise from that thing which is filled with goodness. 105. If it be possible, then _it_ is not full; (106) because _any_ one thing, when said _to be_ full, is no place _for_ anything else; (107) and when _there_ is no place _for_ anything else, other things are not improved by it.

108\. If the sacred being _be_ perfect in goodness and wisdom, the folly and evil of _any_ one are known not to arise from him. 109. If it be possible for them to arise from him, then _he_ is not perfect. 110. If _he be_ not perfect, it is not proper to glorify _him_ for the sacredness of complete goodness. 111. If good and evil have crept on from the sacred being, _he_ is imperfect in goodness. 112. If _he be_ imperfect in goodness, _he_ is imperfect in good information. 113. If_he be_ imperfect in good information, so also _he_ is imperfect in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, intellect, and other appliances of sagacity. 114. If _he be_ imperfect in wisdom, understanding, intellect, _and_ knowledge, _he_ is imperfect in health. 115. If _he be_ imperfect in health, he is apt to become sick. 116. If he be apt to become sick, _he_ is imperfect in life.

117\. If any one shall speak thus: ‘I always see that from one nature, such as _that of_ mankind, alike good and alike evil have always crept on, through actions owing to them,’ (118) that is for this reason, <span id="p161"><sup><small>[ p. 161 ]</small></sup></span> because mankind are not perfect even in one _thing_. 119. And on account of imperfection in goodness, evil has crept on from them; (120) and also on account of imperfection, even in health, they become sick. 121. For the same reason they die, (122) because the cause of death is the struggling of two competing propensities within one nature. 123. There where two competing propensities exist within one nature, the occurrence of sickness and death is known.

124\. If any one shall say that there are good and evil actions which, until they are done, do not exist, (125) then they _may_ give this reply [^28], (126) that the occurrence of an action apart from doing is as impossible as any propensity apart from a nature; and, as to the nature, (127) its [^29] continuance and arrangement are then known thereby not to occur through its own self. 128. For when a man indulges in wrath, Vohûman [^30] is far from there; (129) and when Vohûman holds the position, wrath is not there. 130. When a man tells a lie, truth is far from there [^31]; (131) and when he speaks true, falsehood has no position there, and that man is called truthful. 132. So also when sickness _has_ come, health is not there; (133) and when health _has_ come, sickness _has_ gone. <span id="p162"><sup><small>[ p. 162 ]</small></sup></span> 134. Just as a substance which is not moving can exist, (135) but movement, except in a substance, cannot exist.

136\. About this chapter, too, collected as a summary, (137) do you reverently [^32] and discreetly observe and instruct thereon.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (152:2) See Chap. IV, 73 n.

[^2]: (152:3) And, therefore, competing, as their natures are different.

[^3]: (153:1) Sans. has ‘so that where (yatra) good is,’ which has induced JE to insert Pâz. <i>e</i>dar for Sans. yatra, so as to make the author say ‘when good is here (in this world), the non-existence of evil there (in the other world) is unquestionable.’ A noteworthy instance of punctilious blundering, on the part of a revising copyist, making an author say more than he means.

[^4]: (153:2) Mentioned in §§ 5-11; those in § 4 having been just referred to.

[^5]: (154:1) That Nêr. thus read pôst is shown by his Sanskrit translation of the word, but the original word was probably pô<i>s</i>t, ‘the back.’

[^6]: (154:2) See Chap. V, 12-14 for the technical meaning of this word.

[^7]: (154:3) As in the case of death and decay.

[^8]: (154:4) Reading adina<i>s</i>am, ‘then its by me,’ which is the Pahlavi form indicated by the Pâz. ainâum of Nêr. (see Mkh. IX, 6 n).

[^9]: (154:5) Chap. VII, 4, 5, 19-21.

[^10]: (155:1) Reading sa<i>z</i>ê<i>d</i>, as in JE, because, although AK, PB3, MH19 have Pâz. sah<i>e</i><i>d</i>, ‘seems,’ Nêr. uses Sans. <i>s</i>aknoti.

[^11]: (155:2) And, therefore, cannot have been actuated by the design mentioned in § 44.

[^12]: (155:3) Mentioned in § 45.

[^13]: (155:4) Reading khvâftanŏ, instead of Pâz. anâftan, which is almost identical in writing; and making a similar correction in § 56.

[^14]: (156:1) Pâz. rôdamãnã, which Nêr translates by the Sanskrit for ‘trees and grains;’ and the occurrence of the latter word has induced some reviser of AK to alter the following words zôr-i dârâ, ‘power of maintaining,’ into zôridâêã, ‘grains,’ which alteration has been adopted by MH19 and PB3, but the latter has also zôr-i dârâ inserted in the margin, while JE has both readings in the text which thus means ‘through the power of maintaining _and_ cherishing the quality of grains.’

[^15]: (156:2) The guardian spirit or spiritual representative of each object created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, which acts for that object in the spiritual world (see Mkh. XLIX, 23).

[^16]: (157:1) Sans. has ‘creatures.’

[^17]: (157:2) See § 48.

[^18]: (157:3) See §§ 46, 47.

[^19]: (157:4) Assuming that Pâz. far<i>z</i>înma<i>n</i>d (Sans. gumphita) stands for Pahl. par<i>k</i>în-hômand.

[^20]: (157:5) Pâz. aw<i>e</i>fsûidan (Sans. saṅko<i>k</i>ayitum); but it may be noted that the Pahlavi equivalent of this word might be easily read apasa<i>g</i>agînî<i>d</i>anŏ, ‘to disorganize.’

[^21]: (158:1) From him, the evil spirit, who is said to have left his native abyss and come on towards the light, through the void which intervened (see Bd. I, 3-5,9).

[^22]: (158:2) So in Pâz.-Sans.; but ‘he meditates’ is more probable, and would be written in the same manner in Pahlavi.

[^23]: (158:3) Perhaps referring to the ‘two series of things’ mentioned in Chap. VI, 13-15, but the connection is not very clear.

[^24]: (158:4) Because co-operation in complicated work tends towards division of labour.

[^25]: (159:1) Sans. has ‘others give a reply;’ but the Pâz. anyê, ‘others,’ is certainly a misreading of Pahl. adîn aê, ‘then this,’ or adîna<i>s</i>, ‘then to him,’ in which latter case the phrase would be ‘then they _may_ give a reply to him.’ The proper Pâzand for ‘other’ is awar<i>e</i> or han.

[^26]: (159:2) See Chap. IV, 22 n.

[^27]: (160:1) MH19 has ‘to maintain.’

[^28]: (161:1) See § 95 n.

[^29]: (161:2) Reading adîna<i>s</i>a<i>s</i>, ‘then its thereby’ (with a double pronominal suffix), which is the original Pahlavi indicated by Pâz. ainâ<i>s</i> (see Mkh. IX, 6 n).

[^30]: (161:3) The archangel ‘good thought,’ who is said to hold the position and vanquish ‘evil thought,’ while the angel Srôsh does the same as regards ‘wrath’ (see Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, quoted in Dd. XCIV, 1 n; also Bd. XXX, 29).

[^31]: (161:4) Sans. adds ‘and that man is called false,’ which JE also inserts in Pâzand in the margin, but all other manuscripts omit.

[^32]: (162:1) Assuming that Pâz. dâramaihâ (Sans. sûkshmatayâ) is a misreading of Pahl. garâmîkîhâ. It would more easily be a misreading of sharmakîhâ, ‘modestly,’ but this term seems rather less likely to be applied by the author to his readers.
