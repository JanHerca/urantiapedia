## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LI.

1\. The fifty-first subject is this, that it is incumbent on every one to send a child to school, and to teach _it_ something. 2. Because every duty and good work that a child performs is just as though the father and mother had performed _it_ with their own hands. 3. Therefore it is necessary to make an effort, so that they _may_ teach them something good, and make _them_ aware of good works and sin; for they are doing that on account of their own souls, so that those _children may_ be courageous in doing good works.

4 [^1]. If they are not taught, they then perform less duty _and_ good works, _and_ less reaches the souls of the father and mother. 5. And it also happens that if they do not deliver children to school, and do not teach _them_ anything, and they become bold in committing sin, that sin [^2] becomes _fixed_ on the necks of the father and mother.

6\. Therefore they have decided rightly who [^3] teach <span id="p314"><sup><small>[ p. 314 ]</small></sup></span> them something, especially _what_ is proper and improper according to revelation; because the chief principle is this, whether, through the duty of this world, a good _or_ bad result is coming hereafter.
