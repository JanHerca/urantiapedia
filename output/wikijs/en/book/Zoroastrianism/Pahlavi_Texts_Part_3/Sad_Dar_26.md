## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. The twenty-sixth subject is this, that the wise and the ancients say that when a man becomes fifteen years _of age_ it is necessary that he takes <span id="p289"><sup><small>[ p. 289 ]</small></sup></span> one of the angels [^1] as his own protection [^2], _that_ he takes one of the wise as his own sage, and _that_ he takes one of the high-priests and officiating priests as his own high-priest. 2. So that, if, any time, a bereavement (âstânah) approaches, he _may_ beg a favour from the archangels [^3], in order that it _may_ furnish [^4] an escape _from that_ bereavement. 3. And [^5], any time any affair comes forward, and _he has_ [^6] to have opinion (râî) _and_ advice (ma<i>s</i>varat), he holds a consultation with that sage, while the sage tells him _his_ opinion (tadbîr). 4. And, if any _question as to_ proper and improper comes forward, he speaks with that high-priest, so that he _may_ tell him _in_ reply.

5\. When the instructions of these three persons are brought to pass, carrying _out_ the commands of the sacred being is accomplished. 6. Especially the instructions of the high-priests, because their satisfaction is connected with the satisfaction of the sacred being; and the high-priests possess so much dignity (martabat) _in_ the presence of the sacred being, the good _and_ propitious, that they are quite able to forgive _any_ trivial one of the sins of mankind [^7], and Hôrmazd, the good _and_ propitious, quickly [^8] forgives that sin for the high-priest. 7. <span id="p290"><sup><small>[ p. 290 ]</small></sup></span> Therefore, carrying _out_ the commands of the high-priests becomes [^9] incumbent on every one; and the fulfilment of this maxim is _better_ than _that of_ a whole assemblage of maxims.
