## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER LXIII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘Which is that good work which is greater and better [^1] than \[all [^2]\] good works, and no trouble (an<i>g</i>înakŏ) whatever is necessary for its performance [^3]?’

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: ‘To be grateful in the world, (5) _and_ to wish happiness for every one. 6. This is greater and better than every good work, and no commotion (an<i>g</i>înakŏ) whatever is necessary for its performance [^4].’

Peace and prosperity [^5].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (113:1) L19 inserts ‘more valuable and more advantageous.’

[^2]: (113:2) K43 omits ‘all.’

[^3]: (113:3) L19 has ‘no trouble and expense are necessary in it.’

[^4]: (113:4) This reply is much altered by Nêr. and stands as follows, in L19:—‘To wish happiness for every one; (5) to be grateful unto the sacred beings and the good; (6) in every position and time to consider and keep in remembrance Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as regards creativeness, and Aharman, as regards destructiveness; (7) and to be without doubt as to the existence of the sacred beings, the religion and soul, heaven and the account in the three days, and the reality of the resurrection and future existence. 8. This, most especially, is the good work which is greater and better, more valuable and more advantageous than all good works, and no trouble and expense are necessary in it.’
  The text of all versions ends abruptly at this point, without any peroration.

[^5]: (113:5) Only in K43.
