## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XLII.

1\. The forty-second subject is this, that it is necessary to practise strict abstinence _from_ that sin _which affects_ accusers [^1]. 2. That would be when any one slanders (buhtânad) [^2], or any one commits a rape on the wife of some one [^3], or causes a woman _to occupy_ a separate bed from her own husband.

3\. These are sins _for_ which there is no retribution, except when thou beggest forgiveness of that person whom thy sin has assailed. 4. Afterwards, they keep back the soul, _at_ the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, till the time when its antagonist arrives and exacts justice from it; then it obtains release.

5\. Every time that any one applies a falsehood or a slander to some person, so that _people_ are afterwards <span id="p306"><sup><small>[ p. 306 ]</small></sup></span> telling that falsehood again, and it vexes the heart of that person, they are bringing punishment ever anew on the soul of that _former_ one. 6. The sin does not depart through _the performance of_ duties and good works, so long as he does not make _his_ antagonist satisfied.

7\. This is a grave sin, _and_ it is requisite to he careful that they do not commit _it_.
