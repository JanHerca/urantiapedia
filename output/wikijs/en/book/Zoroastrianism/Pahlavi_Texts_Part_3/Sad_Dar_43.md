## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XLIII.

1\. The forty-third subject is this, that it is necessary to make an endeavour to kill noxious creatures _and_ reptiles (‘ha<i>s</i>arât) of the earth; because, in revelation [^1], it is put _forth as_ a great good work.

2\. Especially these five things:—One is the frog in the water, the second is the snake and scorpion, the third is the ant (mar<i>k</i>is) [^2] that flies, the fourth is the _common_ ant (môr<i>k</i>ah), and the fifth is the mouse. 3. Therefore [^3], every time that they bring a frog up, out of the water, and make _it_ dry, and, after (ba’hd) that, kill it, it is a good work of a thousand _and_ two hundred dirhams _in_ weight [^4]. 4. And every time that they kill a snake, and recite the Avesta that is _appointed_ for that _occasion_ [^5], it is <span id="p307"><sup><small>[ p. 307 ]</small></sup></span> just as though they have slain an apostate (âshmô_gh_). 5. For every one who kills a _flying_ ant (mar<i>k</i>is) it is as much good work as _for_ any one who is reciting _inward_ prayer _for_ ten days. 6. Among the creatures of Aharman nothing whatever is more harmful than this; for, if it dies in the air (havâ) it becomes a gnat, if it dies in the dust it becomes a worm, if it dies in the water it becomes a leech [^6], if it dies among the excavators of flesh it becomes a venomous snake (mâr-i af’haî), and if it dies in dung it becomes creeping _things_. 7. _For_ every one who kills a corn-dragging ant it is as much good work as _for_ any one _who_ recites the Hôrmazd Ya<i>s</i>t. 8. And _for_ every one who kills many noxious creatures it is as much good work as _for_ a priest who performs the ceremonial of the sacred beings; both good works are equal. 9. _For_ every one who kills a mouse it is as much good work as _if_ four lions are killed [^7]. 10. Therefore, it is incumbent on every one to make an effort to kill a noxious creature.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (306:1) See Vend. XIV, 9-17, XVIII, 144-146.

[^2]: (306:2) If mar<i>k</i>is were Pahlavi, it would mean ‘the deadly thing.’ Possibly ‘the locust’ (mala‘<i>h</i>) is meant, but the description in § 6 is rather perplexing.

[^3]: (306:3) Lp omits ‘therefore,’ and B29 has ‘and.’

[^4]: (306:4) See Chap, XII, 9 n. The frog is considered noxious because it is supposed to injure the water, being generally found in stagnant pools which are unwholesome.

[^5]: (306:5) An Avesta passage of about thirty words, to be used on such occasions, is to be found in the Rivâyats, but is still unedited.

[^6]: (307:1) B29 has ‘hedgehog.’

[^7]: (307:2) Ants and mice (or rats) are considered noxious on account of the damage they do to certain crops and farmers’ stores.
