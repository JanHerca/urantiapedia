## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXVIII.

1\. The sixty-eighth subject is this, that for a menstruous woman who casts an eye upon a fire it is a sin of twelve dirhams _in_ weight [^1]; and if she goes _within_ three steps of the fire it is a sin of a thousand _and_ two hundred dirhams [^2] _in_ weight for her; and when she puts her hand _to_ the fire it is a sin of fifteen Tanâvars for her.

2\. In like manner, if she takes a look _at_ running water it is a sin of twelve dirhams _in_ weight for her [^3]; if she goes _within_ fifteen steps of running water it is a sin of fifteen dirhams _in_ weight for her; and when she sits down in running water it is a sin of fifteen Tanâvars for her. 3. And when she walks in the rain, through every drop that drops upon her limbs _there_ arises a sin of one Tanâvar for her.

4\. _If_ she comes to a Khûrshê<i>d</i> Nyâyi<i>s</i> [^4], to observe _it_, it is not proper _for her_ to speak a word with a <span id="p333"><sup><small>[ p. 333 ]</small></sup></span> righteous man [^5]. 5. It is not proper _for her_ to put a bare foot on the ground. 6. It is not proper _for her_ to eat any food with a _bare_ hand; it is not proper _for her_ to eat bread _when_ satisfied [^6]. 7. It is not proper _for_ two menstruous women to eat together; it is not proper for them to sleep _so_ [^7].

8\. And so long as three days _have_ not elapsed it is not proper to wash the hands [^8], and three days after that, if she _has_ perceived herself clean, it is requisite to remain another day, and _so_ until the lapse of nine days, _when_, if she _has_ perceived herself clean, it is not necessary _to remain_ to the end of [^9] another _interval of_ time. 9. If menstruation occurs _for_ twenty-nine days, it is necessary [^10] to consider that she is menstruous a second time, and during three other days it is not proper to wash again, and it is necessary to exercise care, just like that which [^11] I first wrote _about_.

10\. If she be doubtful whether menstruation is come to her, it is requisite _for her_ to strip off _her_ dress, and then to take notice if she has become menstruous, _or if_ the dress that is stripped off be clean. 11. If she has an infant _to feed_ with _her_ milk, <span id="p334"><sup><small>[ p. 334 ]</small></sup></span> _one_ puts away the dress from the infant, and gives _it to_ the mother till it _has_ fed _on_ the milk, _and_ then it is proper to give _it_ to other persons. 12. It is pure, but when the mother washes _her_ head she also washes [^12] the head of the infant.

13\. And it is necessary _for_ a menstruous _woman_ that she _should_ not pass by the end of [^13] anything ceremonially washed, for, if it be a thousand cubits (gaz) _in length_, she makes the whole _of it_ polluted, _and_ it becomes unclean. 14. With any one _who_ holds a sacred-twig stand [^14] she _should_ not speak a word; _and_ if a priest holds the sacred twigs in _his_ hand, _and_ a menstruous _woman_ speaks some (ba’hʓ̣ê) words [^15] from afar, or he walks within three steps of a menstruous woman, she makes _it_ [^16] unclean.
