## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER LXI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘Which is the chief of men? Which is the chief of women? 3. Which is the chief of horses? Which is the chief of flying creatures? 4. \[Which is the chief of oxen?\] [^6] Which is the chief of wild animals? Which is the chief of grains?’

5\. The spirit of wisdom answered (6) thus: 'The man who is wise, who is steadfast in the religion, who is well-praising, who is true-speaking is chief over _his_ associates. <span id="p108"><sup><small>[ p. 108 ]</small></sup></span> 7\. 'The woman who is young [^1], who is properly disposed, who is faithful, who is respected, who is good-natured, who enlivens the house, whose modesty and awe are virtuous, a friend of her own father and elders [^2], husband and guardian, handsome and replete with animation [^3] is chief over the women who are her own associates.

8\. 'The ox which is glorious, which is tall-eared, which has a herd _of cows_ is chief over oxen.

9\. ‘The <i>K</i>îharâ<i>v</i> [^4] is the chief of birds. 10. The horse which is swift [^5] is the chief of horses. 11. The hare [^6] is the chief of wild animals; _and_ wheat [^7] is the chief of grains.’

## Footnotes

[^6]: (107:6) K43 omits the question in brackets.

[^1]: (108:1) L19 has ‘talking, eloquent.’

[^2]: (108:2) Nêr. translates nîyâk by 'father's brother,' an elder who is considered as a special protector in India.

[^3]: (108:3) Reading namag-âkûn, which epithet is omitted in L19.

[^4]: (108:4) A name of the Kar<i>s</i>ipt, who is said to be the chief of birds in this world (Pahl. Visp. I, 1, Bd. XXIV, 11), the Vi<i>s</i> Kar<i>s</i>ipta who brought the religion to the enclosure formed by Yim (see Vend. II, 138, 139), and which is said, in the Pahlavi version, to be ‘a <i>K</i>ahârvâk (or <i>K</i>ahârnâk) who goes back into the existence of the spirits.’ To determine the meaning of this name (which Nêr. translates by Sans: <i>k</i>akravâka, ‘Brahmany duck’) we have to consider not only the two forms <i>k</i>îharâ<i>v</i> and <i>k</i>ahârvâk, but also the term <i>k</i>ark, ‘falcon,’ used in Bd. XXIV, 11. The <i>k</i>âmrô<i>s</i> of Bd. XIX, 15, XXIV, 29 (the <i>k</i>înâmrô<i>s</i> of Chap. LXII, 40) is also said to be the chief of birds, but probably mythic birds are meant.

[^5]: (108:5) L19 has ‘white,’ as in Bd. XXIV, 6.

[^6]: (108:6) See Bd. XXIV, 9.

[^7]: (108:7) See Bd. XXIV, 19.
