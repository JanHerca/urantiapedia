## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LX.

1\. The sixtieth subject is this, that we are keeping the good _and_ pure religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers with us [^2], so that escape from hell _may_ be possible for our souls [^3]. 2. And we are completely united in hope, and through investigation (ta‘hqîq) we fully understand that, when we are steadfast in the good religion, we arrive in heaven. 3. And we know that arrival in heaven occurs through virtuous actions, and through them we are saved; so that we think of good [^4], speak of good, and do good.

4\. And no doing of good is better than that which _offers itself_ when a difficult duty comes before one of the good religion as his soul wishes to depart. 5. Since it comes to thee, do thou give help _to_ that which has escaped _his_ hand, so that he _may_ come out of that hindrance; and do thou not forsake _him_ <span id="p322"><sup><small>[ p. 322 ]</small></sup></span> so that he relinquishes the religion. 6. For after that, while he is in the religion, _and_ while his children, after him, are in the religion [^1], every duty and good work that he does—and _his_ children—is just like those which are done by _thine_ own hand.

7\. And _it is_ just like that with regard to poll-tax, it is also indispensable to give _it_ in semblance of help, so that they _may_ give that person _his_ release (‘<i>h</i>alâʓ), and he _may_ stay in his own place, _and_ the advantage of a good work (THavâb) _may_ come to that _other person_.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (321:2) Lp has ‘through hope.’

[^3]: (321:3) B29, J15 have ‘that in the good _and_ pure religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers it is declared that we are maintaining a hope that the soul _may_ obtain escape from hell.’

[^4]: (321:4) La puts the thinking of good last of the three.

[^1]: (322:1) B29 omits these ten words.
