## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXII.

1\. The twenty-second subject is this, that the performance of <i>G</i>âda<i>n</i>gôî [^2] (‘intercession’) is like that when some one is occasioning the ceremonial of the sacred beings. 2. Therefore, it should be expedient that it be continuous, _and that_ [^3] they perform <i>G</i>âda<i>n</i>gôî as regards the priests and high-priests and the worthy.

3\. For, in the commentary of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask, it says that every one who performs <i>G</i>âda<i>n</i>gôî, and extracts anything from a person on their account, and conveys _it_ to them, is as much without dishonesty (‘<i>h</i>iyânat), towards them [^4], as he who may <span id="p286"><sup><small>[ p. 286 ]</small></sup></span> have given to them out of his own property. 4. And _in_ the spiritual _existence_ they take [^1] account of that profit for him, and just as they make _out_ the account of the good work of that person who may have given _it_, even so much is his good work.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (285:2) The original Pahlavi of this word can be read either dâ<i>d</i>ŏ-gôbîh, ‘a speaking of the law,’ or yêdatô-gôbîh, ‘a speaking of the sacred being;’ in either case it implies ‘pleading for the proper observance of religious duties,’ especially the duty of supporting the priesthood and the poor, and it is for such purposes that the ‘intercession’ with those possessing property must be understood as being exercised. As the traditional mode of reading Pahl. yêdatô is <i>g</i>âtan, or <i>g</i>â<i>d</i>an, it is evident that the Pâzand inventors of the word in the text must have understood the Pahlavi in the latter of the two meanings mentioned above.

[^3]: (285:3) Lp, B29 have merely ‘that continuously.’

[^4]: (285:4) Lp, B29 omit these two words. But the meaning of La seems to be that he who bestows charity out of the contributions of others, without mentioning the contributors, does not act dishonestly towards the recipients.

[^1]: (286:1) Lp, B29 have ‘the spirits take.’
