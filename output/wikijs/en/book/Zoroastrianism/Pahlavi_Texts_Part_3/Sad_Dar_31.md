## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXXI.

1\. The thirty-first subject is this, that, every time they eat bread, it is necessary to withhold three morsels from their own bodies, and to give _them_ to a dog. 2. And it is not desirable to beat a dog. 3. For, of the poor no one whatever is poorer than <span id="p293"><sup><small>[ p. 293 ]</small></sup></span> a dog, _and_ it is necessary to give a tethered _animal_ bread, because the good work is great.

4\. And in revelation it is declared in this manner, that, if a dog is asleep upon the road, it is not proper that they put a foot violently on the ground, so that he becomes awake. 5. And, in former times, an allowance (râtib) of bread would have been made every day for the sake of the dogs, three times in summer _and_ twice in winter, on this account, that _one_ wishes _them_ to come to the assistance of his soul at the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge.

6\. In the worldly _existence_ they are the guard of men and cattle. 7. If _there_ had not been a dog they would not have been able to keep a single sheep. 8. Every time that he barks, just as his bark goes forth, the demons and fiends run away from the place.
