## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER LVII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘Wherefore _is it_ when the knowledge and sagacity of the spiritual and worldly _existences_, both united, are connected with thee?’

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'For this reason, because, from the first, I, who am the innate wisdom, _apart_ from the spiritual and worldly existences, have been with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 5. And <span id="p99"><sup><small>[ p. 99 ]</small></sup></span> the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> created (âfrî<i>d</i>ŏ) the angels of the spiritual and worldly creations, and all the other creatures and creations through the power and mightiness, the wisdom and sagacity of innate wisdom; and I produce [^1] and he maintains and stimulates _them_. 6. And at the end of the renovation _of the universe_ it is possible to cause the annihilation and destruction of Aharman and his miscreations more fully by the power of wisdom; (7) and Sôshâns [^2], with Kaî-Khûsrôî [^2], and those who the resurrection and future existence are able to act more fully, by means of the power and help of wisdom.

8\. 'The knowledge and sagacity of the worldly _existence_, the learning and teaching in [^3] every profession, and all advancement of temporal _beings_ [^4] are through wisdom: 9. The souls of the righteous, in escaping from hell [^5] and coming [^6] to heaven and the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân), arrive much better by means of the power and protection of wisdom. 10. And it is possible to seek the good living, pleasure, good repute, and every happiness of people in the worldly _existence_, through the power of wisdom.

11\. 'And the maintenance of the seeds of men <span id="p100"><sup><small>[ p. 100 ]</small></sup></span> and beasts _of burden_, oxen and sheep, and also every other creature and creation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the lord, the seating [^7] _of them_ in the womb, and making manifest what is their food in the womb, so that they shall not die from hunger and thirst, and the allotment and maturing of the limbs are effected [^8] more fully by means of the durability (dôrângarîh) and great potency which are in the force [^9] of wisdom.

12\. 'The arrangement of the earth and the mingling of the water in the earth, the growth and increase of plants, colour of various kinds, and the scent, taste, and pleasantness of various things are allotted and produced more fully through wisdom. 13. And the arrangement of Albûr<i>z</i> [^10] around the world, the manifestation of the earth of the seven regions [^11] and the sky above the mountain of Albûr<i>z</i>, the motion of the sun and moon and twelve constellations [^12], the six times of the season festivals (gâsanbâr) [^13]. the five times _devoted_ to the guardian spirits (fravar<i>d</i>îkân) [^14], the heaven which is in the place of good thoughts, the place of good words, the place of good deeds, and the perfect supreme <span id="p101"><sup><small>[ p. 101 ]</small></sup></span> heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân) of all gloriousness [^15], the path of the spirits and worldly _existences_, and the <i>K</i>indvar bridge [^16] are produced and allotted through the power of wisdom.

14\. 'The watery-looking [^17] cloud's seizing water from the sea, advancing in the atmosphere, and gradually breaking away [^18], drop by drop, to the earth, and Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s [^19] creatures’ thoroughly understanding the nature of heaven and hell, the compassion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the archangels, and other angels as regards their own creatures, and the devastation and destructiveness of Aharman and the demons as regards the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> it is possible to comprehend through the more complete power [^20] of wisdom. 15. And the good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, the sayings and teaching of the spirits [^21], and the demons’ demolishing the worldly body _and_ making _it_ imperceptible by the sight of men are apprehended [^22] more fully by means of the most perfect means of wisdom. 16. And even the struggle and warfare of Irân with foreigners (an-aîrân), and the smiting of Aharman and the demons it is possible to effect through the power of wisdom. <span id="p102"><sup><small>[ p. 102 ]</small></sup></span> 17\. 'To occasion the sun's inspection of the hidden water also, below the earth, it is expedient to convey _it_ for tillage and cultivation, and the advantage, comfort, and enjoyment of men and beasts of burden, oxen and sheep, through the power of wisdom. 18. The thorough understanding of the pain and sickness of men and beasts _of burden_, oxen, sheep, and other animals, and the bringing of medicine and remedies, health of body and comfort unto them are much more possible to effect [^23] by means of the power of wisdom.

19\. 'And _as to_ every man whose participation in wisdom is. much, his share of heaven is then much more. 20. Even _as to_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^24], Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^25], Gâyômar<i>d</i> [^26], and those others whose share of heaven was much the more [^27], _it was_ on account of the much coming of wisdom unto them. 21. And _as to_ Yim, Frê<i>d</i>ûn, Kâî-Ûs [^28], and those other rulers who obtained splendour (var<i>g</i>ŏ) and mightiness (tagakîh) [^29] from the sacred beings just as the participation of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and other rulers in the religion occurred [^30]—and their not attaining to the religion, and also as to the _times_ when they have become ungrateful unto their own lord [^31], _it was_ on account of the little coming of wisdom unto them.

22\. 'And Aharman, also, and the demons deceive that man more, and lead _him_ to hell, who is poorer <span id="p103"><sup><small>[ p. 103 ]</small></sup></span> of wisdom and unsteadier in disposition. 23. And _it_ is manifest, that, unto _him_ who is virtuous in disposition, habit, and demeanour [^32], praise is then _due_, owing to his maintenance of wisdom. 24. For _it_ is declared, that Aharman shouted to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus [^33]: "If thou desist from this good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, then I _will_ give thee a thousand years’ dominion of the worldly _existence_, (25) as _was_ given to the Va<i>d</i>akân [^34] monarch Dahâk [^35]." 26. On account of complete wisdom, the virtuous disposition and demeanour of Zaratû<i>s</i>t not _having_ hearkened and not being deluded, he did not become deceived and longing through that temptation of the accursed evil _one_, the wicked [^36]. 27. And he spoke to Aharman (28) thus: “I _will_ shatter and cause to run (dûkânam) [^37], and _will_ make downcast (nigûîsâr) for thee [^38], the bodies of your demons and fiends, wizards and witches, through the Hôm [^39] _and_ sacred twigs [^40], and the good, true <span id="p104"><sup><small>[ p. 104 ]</small></sup></span> religion which the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _has_ taught to me.” 29. Aharman, when those words _were_ heard by him, became confounded and stupefied, and rushed to hell, and remained confounded a long time.

30\. 'This, too, is declared, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, when Aharman, by agreement [^41], had further operated [^42] with his (Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s) creatures and creation of every kind, afterwards formed an assembly with the angels and archangels of every kind [^43], and the welfare (â<i>v</i>â<i>d</i>îh) due to his own wisdom _was_ mentioned and recounted by him.

31\. 'This, too, is declared, that _for_ the nine thousand years of renovation [^44], until the resurrection and future existence, wisdom maintains and stimulates the creatures and creation of every kind.

32\. ‘And this, too, is declared, that, _as to_ him who is an ignorant and bad-tempered man, when he attains even to much eminence, opulence, and authority, even then he is not fit to elevate into that welfare and authority.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (99:1) So in K43, but Nêr. has taken this verb in the third person,. in place of the nearly synonymous âfrî<i>d</i>ŏ, so as to state that the creator ‘created, maintains, and stimulates the angels’ and all other existences through the power of innate wisdom. The object of the Pahlavi text, however, seems to be to emphasize the fact that the creation was specially due to the innate wisdom of the creator, while its maintenance is dependent on all his powers and attributes.

[^2]: (99:2) See Chaps. II, 95, XXVII, 63.

[^3]: (99:3) L19 has ‘of.’

[^4]: (99:4) L19 has ‘times.’

[^5]: (99:5) That is, in escaping from the risk of being sent to hell.

[^6]: (99:6) L19 omits ‘and coming.’

[^7]: (100:1) Nêr. has read shâyastan, ‘possibility,’ instead of nishâstanŏ, ‘seating.’

[^8]: (100:2) Reading vâdûrnî-hênd. L19 has ‘are possible to effect.’

[^9]: (100:3) L19 has ‘by means of the great potency and force.’

[^10]: (100:4) See Chap. XLIV, 16 n.

[^11]: (100:5) See Chap. IX, 2 n.

[^12]: (100:6) The signs of the zodiac, whose apparent movement, due to the motion of the earth, is here alluded to.

[^13]: (100:7) See Chap. IV, 5 n.

[^14]: (100:8) The five supplementary days, named after the five Gâthas or sacred hymns, which follow the twelfth month in order to complete the Parsi year of 365 days. Together with the five preceding days they are specially devoted to the homage of the guardian spirits or Fravashis.

[^15]: (101:1) The four grades of heaven (see Chap. VII, 9-12).

[^16]: (101:2) See Chap. II, 115 n. By omitting ‘and’ Nêr. identifies this bridge with the path mentioned before if, but it forms only one portion of the path to the other world.

[^17]: (101:3) Assuming that mâ-vênakŏ stands for mayâ-vênakŏ.

[^18]: (101:4) Pahl. vîkhtanŏ is more probably connected with Pers. kîkhtan, ‘to break,’ than with Pers. pîkhtan, ‘to sift.’

[^19]: (101:5) The Sanskrit version adds ‘and Aharman's.’

[^20]: (101:6) L19 has ‘more fully through the power.’

[^21]: (101:7) L19 has ‘worldly _existences_.’

[^22]: (101:8) Reading girî-hastŏ. L19 has ‘are effected.’

[^23]: (102:1) L19 omits ‘to effect.’

[^24]: (102:2) See Chap. XIII, 14 n.

[^25]: (102:3) See Chap. I, 10 n.

[^26]: (102:4) See Chap. XXVII, 2 n.

[^27]: (102:5) L19 has ‘who more fully obtained a share of heaven.’

[^28]: (102:6) See Chap. VIII, 27, where all three are mentioned.

[^29]: (102:7) L19 has ‘opulence.’

[^30]: (102:8) This clause occurs only in K43.

[^31]: (102:9) They all three suffered misfortunes in their old age, attributed by the priesthood to neglect bf religion, which is here traced to diminution of intellect.

[^32]: (103:1) L19 has ‘virtuous in disposition and virtuous of demeanour.’

[^33]: (103:2) This is stated, in other words, in Vend. XIX, 23-32.

[^34]: (103:3) As Va<i>d</i>ak is said (Dd. LXXII, 5) to have been the mother of Dahâk, this term may be a matronymic implying ‘son of Va<i>d</i>ak.’

[^35]: (103:4) See Chap. VIII, 29 n.

[^36]: (103:5) This section is a good deal altered in the Pâzand version, but the general meaning is the same.

[^37]: (103:6) L19 has va vânom, ‘and I _will_ smite.’

[^38]: (103:7) L19 has ‘and _will_ make withered (nizâr).’

[^39]: (103:8) A plant growing in Persia, small twigs of which are pounded in water, and the resulting juice is tasted by the priest during the ceremonial. It is a symbol of the mythic Hôm, the producer of immortality. (see Chap. LXII, 28). Originally, no doubt, the Hôm (Av. haoma) and the Sans. soma were the same plant (see Dd. XLVIII, 16 n).

[^40]: (103:9) The baresôm (Av. baresma) is a bundle of slender twigs or wires, prepared in a particular manner, to be held in the left hand p. 104 of the priest while reciting certain parts of the liturgy (see Dd. XLIII, 5 n).

[^41]: (104:1) The covenant between the good and evil spirits, by which their conflict was limited to nine thousand years (see Bd. I, 18, 19).

[^42]: (104:2) That is, transformed and vitiated them. The Av. frâkere<i>n</i>ta<i>d</i> (Vend. I, 7), describing the modifying work of the evil spirit upon the creation, is here expressed by f<i>r</i>â<i>g</i>ŏ vâdûn<i>d</i>.

[^43]: (104:3) Such an assembly is mentioned in Vend. II, 42, but its proceedings are not stated.

[^44]: (104:4) So in all versions, but, as the renovation is generally considered as confined to the end of the nine thousand years, we ought perhaps to transpose the words and read ‘for the nine thousand years, until the renovation, resurrection, and future existence.’
