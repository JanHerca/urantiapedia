## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XCI.

1\. The ninety-first subject is this, that is, _in_ what mode is it necessary to wash everything that becomes polluted by dead matter?

2\. Gold _one is_ to wash over once with _ceremonial_ ablution [^3] to make _it_ dry once with dust, and to wash _it_ over once with water. 3. Silver (nuqrah) _one is to do_ twice; copper, tin, lead, and brass _articles_ three times; steel four times; stone _articles_ six times; turquoise, ruby (yâqût), amber, carbuncle, cornelian (’haqîq), and, like these, whatever is from a mine (ma’hdan) are all to be washed six times in the manner which I have stated. 4. Afterwards they are clean _in_ that manner, when every single time _one_ washes them over with _ceremonial_ ablution, makes <span id="p355"><sup><small>[ p. 355 ]</small></sup></span> _them_ dry with dust, and washes _it_ off [^1]; and just like this _on_ the occasion of the other times—up to three times, or four, or six—as far as whatever is ordered.

5\. For pearls two modes [^2] are ordered, but the conclusion is this, that they _should_ wash _them_ six times, just like stone _articles_. 6. The whole of wooden and earthen _ware_ it is requisite to throw _away_. 7. All clothing of the body it is requisite to wash six times _in_ the manner that I have stated, _and_, after that, to put _them_ in a place where the sun and moon must _shine_ on them _for_ six months [^3]; after that they are fit for a menstruous woman.
