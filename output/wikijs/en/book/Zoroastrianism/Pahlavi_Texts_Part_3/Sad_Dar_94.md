## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XCIV.

1\. The ninety-fourth subject is this, when a person confers a benefit _or_ kindness upon any one, it is necessary that _the latter should_ understand the value of it, and lay the obligation (minnat) upon himself; and, if he be able, he _should_ provide a benefit to that amount (miqdâr) for that _person_.

2\. It is declared in revelation, _that_, when a person confers a benefit upon any one, Hôrmazd [^1] gives him ten times as much, as an equivalent. 3. And, if _the other_ be not understanding [^2] the justice _of this_, it is related in the commentary of the Avesta _in_ this manner, that it is a great sin for him. 4. And Aharman [^3] speaks like this, namely: ‘That sinner is akin to me; _in_ the end he will come into my hands; I will not give him into the hands of any demon, _but_ I _will_ inflict punishment _with_ my own hands.’ 5. _And_ the chief priest [^4] says it is necessary for all Zaratu<i>s</i>tians that they keep themselves far from this sin.
