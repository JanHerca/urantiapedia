## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XCVI.

1\. The ninety-sixth subject is this, when any one departs to that _other_ world it is not proper for others that they _should_ utter an outcry, maintain grief, _and_ make lamentation _and_ weeping. 2. Because every tear _that_ issues _from_ the eyes becomes one _drop_ of that river [^5] before the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> <span id="p359"><sup><small>[ p. 359 ]</small></sup></span> bridge, _and_ then the soul of that dead _person_ remains _at_ that place; it is difficult for it to make a passage there, and it is not able to pass over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge. 3. It is therefore necessary that they recite the Avesta and celebrate the ceremonial, so that the passage of that place _may_ become easy for it.

## Footnotes

[^5]: (358:5) ‘This river is the many tears that men shed from _their_ eyes, as they make lamentation and weeping for the departed. They shed those tears unlawfully, and they swell to this river. Those who are not able to cross over are those for whom, after their departure, p. 359 much lamentation and weeping were made; and those _who cross_ more easily are those for whom less was made’ (AV. XVI, 7-10).
