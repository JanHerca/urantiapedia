## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XXXIX.

1\. The thirty-ninth subject is this, that it is necessary to properly maintain the sacred fire [^1] which they have established in a town or village. 2. And _at_ night it is necessary to make _it_ blaze up once, and by day twice.

3\. For it is declared in revelation, that, if _there_ had been no sacred fire, no one would have been able to go from town to town; because it is _owing to_ the glory of the sacred fire that no one on the roads is able to commit an excess upon any one _else_.

4\. It is necessary that they _should_ present the whole of the firewood; and, _as to_ the person who makes _it_ blaze, they _should_ give him bread and a salary (nafaqah). 5. For, every time that that fire is satisfied, and they maintain _it_ properly, every fire that may exist in the earth of seven regions becomes satisfied with that person.
