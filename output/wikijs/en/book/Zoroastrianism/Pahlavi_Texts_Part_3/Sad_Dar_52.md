## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LII.

1\. The fifty-second subject is this, that it is incumbent on every one that, every year _when_ the month Fravardîn comes on, _he is_ to provide a sacred cake _on_ the day Khurdâ<i>d</i> [^1], and whatever they are able to bring to hand, _a little_ of everything, _they are_ to place by that sacred cake, and to consecrate _it_ with the dedicatory _formula_ Ayaranãm<i>k</i>a [^2], so that <span id="p315"><sup><small>[ p. 315 ]</small></sup></span> the affairs of that year may be better through that day's provision and the entry and coming in _of guests_.

2\. For it is declared in revelation [^3], that, every year, when the day Khurdâ<i>d</i> of the month Fravardîn comes on, they allot a daily provision _for_ mankind, and whatever _one_ wishes to pass to the lot of mankind in that year they write down that day. 3. Therefore, when they shall consecrate this sacred cake, the archangel Khurdâ<i>d</i> [^4] is making intercession for that person.
