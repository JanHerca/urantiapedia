## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER IV.

1\. And _as to_ that which is asked (2) thus: ‘When I always see that all things ever arise from the _celestial_ sphere and stars, (3) and who created this sphere, then it is like that _which_ those of the Vîrô<i>d</i> [^1] religion say, that he created good and evil. 4. If Aharman <span id="p128"><sup><small>[ p. 128 ]</small></sup></span> created _anything_, how did he become able to create the effect of these marvellous things, (5) _and_ why _is it_ when they are stars by which assistance of virtue is always bestowed? 6. If Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Aharman created in conference, then that way _it_ is manifest that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is an accomplice _and_ confederate, with Aharman, in the harm and evil which ever arise from the _celestial_ sphere.’ 7. The answer is this, (8) that the _celestial_ sphere is the place of the divinities (baghân), who are the distributers of happiness, from which they always justly bestow their distribution of every happiness. 9. And the forms of the seven planets (star) are witches who rush below them, despoilers who are antagonistic distributers, (10) whose scriptural name is Gadûg [^2].

11\. _Through_ the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _was_ the arrangement of these creatures and creation, methodically _and_ sagaciously, and for the sake of the continuance of the renovation _of the universe_. 12. As the evil spirit _was_ entangled in the sky, that fiend, with evil astuteness _and_ with lying falsehood, encompassed [^3] _and_ mingled with the light, _together_ with the fiends of crimes of many kinds, who are those of a gloomy race, _thinking_ thus: ‘I _will_ make these creatures _and_ creation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> extinct, or I must make _them_ for my own.’

13\. Those luminaries, the highest of those of the <span id="p129"><sup><small>[ p. 129 ]</small></sup></span> good _being_, became aware, by means of omniscience, of the blemishing operation and the lies _and_ falsehoods of the fiend, (14) _and_ of this too, that is, of what extent _was_ this power of his, by which this blemishing operation and work of ruin creep on [^4], (15) so that, henceforth, _there_ exists no power whatever for its restoration, which is _free_ from the complete daubing of restraint, pain, and entanglement that is inside the sky.

16\. It is they [^5] who are sagaciously mingled by him (the good being) with the substance of the luminaries, because that fiend encompassed and _was_ entangled with his luminaries, therefore all his powers and resources are for the purpose of not allowing the fiends of crimes of many kinds their own performance of what is desirable for them each separately; (17) such as the fiendish venom of the noxious creatures which the four elements (zahakân), pertaining to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, \[keep enveloped [^6]. 18. For if this fiendish venom of the noxious creatures\] does not remain entangled \[with the four elements of the bodily formations pertaining to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>\]—which are water, fire, earth, and air—_it is_ just as though they came to the sky _and_ spiritual existence. 19. <span id="p130"><sup><small>[ p. 130 ]</small></sup></span> _And_ if they attained to spirituality and a disembodied existence, it would not be possible for those creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to avoid _and_ escape from that demoniacal venom of theirs. 20. It would be in the grasp (grôhê) [^7] and mingled with the breath (vâ<i>d</i>) of mankind _and_ the other creatures, _and their_ restoration, support, increase, _and_ growth would not be possible.

21\. So they [^8] also keep those planets enveloped in light, because the fiendish venom of the noxious creatures is in the substance of _those_ luminaries. 22. On account of that, too, the existence of somewhat of advantage is manifest from the serpent species, which are dissolving venom from the multitudes of other wild animals _and_ noxious creatures [^9]. 23. So also from the planets; on account of the commingling of the inferior splendour of _those_ luminaries, benefit is manifested by them.

24\. A similitude of these planets _and_ the benefit which they always bestow (25) is such as the brigands (gadûgân) [^10] _and_ highwaymen who interrupt the path of traders in a caravan. 26. They abstract important things _from_ many, (27) _and_ do not grant and give _them_ to the diligent _and_ worthy, but to sinners, idlers, courtezans, paramours, _and_ the unworthy.

28\. _Observe_ this, too, that this performance of good works which astrologers compute and state from those planets is for this reason, (29) when they have not preferred the method of the divinities <span id="p131"><sup><small>[ p. 131 ]</small></sup></span> (baghân) who are distributing welfare, and that, also, of the five constellations pertaining to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>—which are the great _one_ [^11] that is supreme and measurable [^12], Haptôiring [^13], created by Mazda [^14], _and_ the stars Vanand [^15], Satavês [^16], _and_ Tî<i>s</i>tar [^17]—as regards the brigands (gadûgân) [^18] _and_ distributers of evil. 30. And those are the five planets that rush below them in the shape of stars, and they keep _them_ enveloped in light, which are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. 31. Since the supreme constellation, the great _one_ of the north-opposing [^19] (32) Haptôiring, is opposing Saturn, (33) Haptôiring, created by Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a, is opposing Jupiter, (34) Vanand, the smiter of noxious creatures, is opposing Mars, (35) the star Satavês is opposing Venus, (36) _and_ the star Tî<i>s</i>tar is opposing the planetary Mercury [^20], (37) the welfare, which they say is from those brigands (gadûgân), is from those five constellations pertaining <span id="p132"><sup><small>[ p. 132 ]</small></sup></span> to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (38) as they obtain the triumph of much power _and_ little injury.

39\. And for the sake of not leaving these five planets to their own wills, they are bound _by_ the creator, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, each one by two threads (<i>g</i>îk) to the sun (Mihir) and moon. 40. And their forward motion and backward motion are owing to the same cause. 41. There are _some_ whose length of thread is longer, such as Saturn and Jupiter, (42) and there are _some of_ which _it_ is shorter, such as Mercury and Venus. 43. Every _time_ when they go to the end of the threads, they draw _them_ back from behind, (44) and they do not allow them to proceed by their own wills, (45) so that they _may_ not injure the creatures.

4.6. And those two fiends that are greatly powerful, who are opponents of the planetary sun and moon, move below the splendour of _those_ two luminaries [^21]. 47. Another—even that which is called the brigand (gadûg) of the stars, as regards the welfare that exists [^22]—is likewise confined below the splendour of the sun. 48. And when it [^23] gets far from control, it commits damage and harm on the constellation into which it springs, _and_ on the quarter which is the particular concern of that constellation, (49) until it <span id="p133"><sup><small>[ p. 133 ]</small></sup></span> becomes again, a second _time_, bound _and_ fettered _to_ the sun.

50\. The statement which they offer about it [^24] (51) is this, the conflict of the superior beings within the star station. 52. Out of the inferior of those are the conflicts of Tî<i>s</i>tar and the demon Spen<i>z</i>agar [^25], (53) _of_ the fire Vâzi<i>s</i>t [^26] and the demon A<i>v</i>âush [^27], (54) _and of_ other good spirits with gloomy ones, for the formation of rain and allotment of welfare to the creatures.

55\. Below them are mankind and cattle, noxious creatures and deadly _ones_ [^28], and other creatures that are good and bad. 56. Because propensities (gada<i>s</i>ni) are mingled with mankind, (57) which are greed, lust, malice, wrath, and lethargy, (58) wisdom, temper, skill, knowledge, understanding, and intellect, (59) as the good influences and bad influences are called, which are the causes of good works and sin.

60\. All this welfare of the creatures [^29] is specially owing to the creator of the creatures, (61) who is himself the healer and perfect ruler, the maintainer of protection, nourisher, and caretaker, preserving his own creatures. 62. And, for his own creatures, he <span id="p134"><sup><small>[ p. 134 ]</small></sup></span> has thoroughly created and taught the means of preservation from evil, and the appliances for abstaining from crime.

63\. A semblance, too, of him is such as a wise orchard-owner and gardener who wishes to diminish the wild animals and birds which are mischievous and destructive for his orchard by spoiling the fruit of the trees. 64. And that wise gardener, effacing (padasâê) his own little trouble, for the sake of keeping those mischievous wild animals away from his own orchard, arranges the appliances which are necessary for the capture of those wild animals, (65) such as springes, traps, and snares for birds. 66. So that when a wild animal sees the snare, and wishes to proceed with suspicion of it, through unconsciousness of the springe and trap he is captured therein.

67\. This is certain, that, when a wild animal falls into a trap, _it_ is not a victory of the trap, but that of the arranger of the trap, (68) _and_ through him the wild animal is captured in the trap. 69. The proprietor _and_ orchard-owner, who is the arranger of the trap, is aware through sagacity that the wild animal is powerful, _and_ to what extent and how long a time. 70. The power and strength of that wild animal, which are in its body, are exhausted and poured _out_ by struggling, as much as it is able, in demolishing the trap and _in_ endeavouring to destroy _and_ spoil the springe. 71. And when, on account of imperfect strength, its power of struggling totters _and_ is exhausted, that wise gardener then, by his own will and his own result of determination, wisely throws that wild animal out of the trap, with _its_ existing nature _and_ exhausted strength. 72. And <span id="p135"><sup><small>[ p. 135 ]</small></sup></span> he consigns his own trap and springe, rearranged _and_ undamaged, back to the storehouse.

73\. Even like him is the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, who is the preserver of creations and arranger of creatures [^30], the disabler of the evil original evolution [^31] and protector of his own orchard from the injurer. 74. The mischievous wild animal, which is the spoiler of the orchard, is that accursed Aharman who is the hurrier _and_ disturber of the creatures. 75. The good trap is the sky, in which the good creations are lodging, (76) _and_ in which the evil spirit and _his_ rudimentary [^32] miscreations are captured. 77. And _pertaining_ to the springe and trap of the wild animal, who is mischievous owing to his own wilfulness, is the exhauster (78) time that, for the struggling of Aharman and his powers _and_ resources, is for the long period [^33] (79) which, through the struggling of the wild animal in the springe and trap, is an exhaustion of its strength. 80. The sole [^34] <span id="p136"><sup><small>[ p. 136 ]</small></sup></span> creator of the creatures arranges a preservation again, which is the preparation of an eternal happy progress _free_ from his adversary, which that wise orchard-owner _does with_ his own trap and springe [^35].

81\. Then [^36] the scanty power and want of ability of that fiend for it, in his struggling for the luminaries, are manifest even from this. 82. When as with lying falsehood he thought thus [^37]: ‘I _will_ make this sky and earth and the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> extinct, or I _will_ turn _them_ from their own nature _and_ bring _them_ to my own,’ (83) even then, with _all_ the power, desire of destruction, and perpetual struggling of the fiend, no slaughter whatever _by_ the demons is _free_ from effectual limits; it is this earth and sky, and these creatures, (84) _that_ are propagating from few to many, as is manifest, (85) and innumerable _persons_ are convinced of it. 86. For, if in this struggling any victory should have specially occurred, it would have been impossible to attain from few to many.

87\. Moreover, if the births of the worldly _existence_ are mostly manifest through the occurrence of death therein, even then it is seen that that death is not a complete dissolution of existence, but a necessity of _going_ from place to place, from duty to duty [^38]. 88. For, as the existence of all these creations is _derived_ from the four elements, _it_ is manifest to the sight _that_ those worldly bodies of theirs are to be mingled again with the four elements. 89. The spiritual _parts_, which are the rudimentary appliances of the life <span id="p137"><sup><small>[ p. 137 ]</small></sup></span> stimulating the body, are mingled with the soul—(90) on account of unity of nature they are not dispersed—(91) and the soul is accountable (amârhômand) for its own deeds. 92. Its treasurers [^39], also, unto whom its good works and offences are intrusted, advance there for a contest. 93. When the treasurer of the good works is of greater strength, she preserves it, by her victory, from the hands of the accuser [^40], _and_ settles _it_ for the great throne and the mutual delightfulness of the luminaries; (94) and it is assisted eternally in virtuous progress. 95. And when the treasurer of its offences is of greater strength, it is dragged, through her victory, _away_ from the hands of the helper [^41], (96) _and_ is delivered up to the place of thirst and hunger and the agonizing abode of disease [^42]. 97. And, even there, those feeble good works, which _were_ practised by it in the worldly _existence_, are not useless to it; (98) for, owing to _this_ same reason, that hunger and thirst and punishment are _inflicted_ on it proportionately to the sin, _and_ not lawlessly, (99) because _there_ is a watcher [^43] <span id="p138"><sup><small>[ p. 138 ]</small></sup></span> of the infliction of its punishment. 100. And, ultimately, the compassionate creator, who is the forgiver of the creatures, does not leave any good creature captive in the hands of the enemy [^44]. 101. _But_, one day [^45], he saves even those who are sinful, _and_ those of the righteous through atonement for sin, by the hands of the purifiers, _and_ makes _them_ proceed on the happy course which is eternal.

102\. The conclusion is this, that the creator is the healer and perfect ruler, the maintainer and nourisher, protecting _and_ preserving the creatures [^46]; not a producer of the disease, a causer of the pain, and an inflicter of the punishment of his own creatures. 103. And it is more explicitly written below, with the arrangement of the two original evolutions [^47], among the assertors of the non-existence of a sacred being [^48], and the contemplators of unity [^49].

104\. As ordered and requested by you it is provided (padarâst); do you direct and observe _it_ with kind regards. 105. Because, as written above [^50] by us, I do not hold the station of teaching, but really that of learning. 106. Even this teaching of doctrines is that which _was_ obtained by me, through the religion of wisdom [^51], from the writing (nipîk) of Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>îyâvand [^52], and is here indicated. 107. And his teachings <span id="p139"><sup><small>[ p. 139 ]</small></sup></span> are in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> [^53] manuscript (nipîk), which the supremely learned Âtû<i>r</i>\-frôbag [^54], son of Farukh-zâ<i>d</i>, who was the leader of those of the good religion, explained out of _his_ knowledge of the religion, _and_ which consists of a thousand subjects [^55].

108\. Of that, too, which is asked by you about unlimitedness and limitation, I have written below [^56], through the will of the sacred beings.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (127:3) Compare Sans. viruddha, ‘perverse, contradictory,’ or Pers. bulûd, ‘antiquity.’ It is possible that Muhammadanism is alluded to, as that religion is hardly ever mentioned by name in Pahlavi writings, probably from motives of policy.

[^2]: (128:1) Av. gadha, a term for ‘a brigand’ which is used in conjunction with witches and other evil beings in the Srôsh Yt. Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht, 5, 6.

[^3]: (128:2) Supposing that the Pâz. frawast (fravast in § 16) stands for Pahl. parvast, as in Chaps. VIII, 96, 97, XIV, 73, XVI, 56, 60, 66-69, 71, 72; but as Nêr. uses Sans. prasarpita, pravish<i>t</i>a, pravartita, samudgata, and samutpatita to translate the word, he must have assumed that it stood for fra<i>z</i>ast (Pahl. fra<i>g</i>ast, ‘sprang forth’).

[^4]: (129:1) Sans. ‘will retreat,’ as if Nêr. understood the pronoun ‘his’ to refer to the good spirit, instead of the evil one; the application of the pronouns in §§ 14, 15 being by no means clear in the original text.

[^5]: (129:2) The spiritual representatives of the luminaries, who are angels.

[^6]: (129:3) The words in brackets are omitted in AK, PB3, L23, so that §§ 17, 18, in those MSS., stand as follows:—‘Since the fiendish venom of the noxious creatures, that the four elements pertaining to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>—which are water, fire, earth, and air—have not entangled, is just as though they (the creatures) came to the sky _and_ spiritual _existence_.’

[^7]: (130:1) Or grôhê may mean ‘an assemblage.’

[^8]: (130:2) The angels of the luminaries.

[^9]: (130:3) Which they eat, and thereby diminish the number of such objectionable creatures.

[^10]: (130:4) See § 10 n.

[^11]: (131:1) Called ‘the great _one_ of the middle of the sky’ in Bd. II, 8, V, I, which has not yet been identified, but may be Regulus or Orion.

[^12]: (131:2) Sans. ‘very visible.’

[^13]: (131:3) See Mkh. XLIX, 15-21, where it is called Haptôk-ring.

[^14]: (131:4) This epithet is often applied to Haptôiring, Vanand, and Satavês.

[^15]: (131:5) See Mkh. XLIX, 12-14.

[^16]: (131:6) See Mkh. LXII, 13.

[^17]: (131:7) See Mkh. XLIX, 5, 6.

[^18]: (131:8) The planetary witches (see § 10).

[^19]: (131:9) Or it may be ‘planetary-opposing,’ or ‘north-accepting.’ The dislocation, and probable corruption, of these sections is due to Nêr., who evidently considered the epithet mazdadhâta, ‘created by Mazda,’ as the name of one of the constellations, and ‘great’ and ‘supreme’ as mere epithets of Haptôiring. But he found it difficult to adapt the text to this opinion of his.

[^20]: (131:10) These oppositions agree with those mentioned in Bd. V, 1, except that Haptôiring is there opposed to Mars, and Vanand to Jupiter.

[^21]: (132:1) Referring to the supposed cause of eclipses, which are said to be occasioned by two dark bodies revolving below the sun and moon, so as to pass between them and the earth whenever an eclipse occurs (see Dd. LXIX).

[^22]: (132:2) Referring to the supposed injurious influence of comets which, as they usually appear one at a time to the unassisted eye, are here assumed to be a single evil being, the Mû<i>s</i>par of Bd. V, 1, 2.

[^23]: (132:3) We should perhaps say ‘she,’ as a drû<i>g</i>, ‘fiend,’ is usually considered to be a female being, and the Mû<i>s</i>par or Mû<i>s</i>\-pairika is a witch.

[^24]: (133:1) Meaning, probably, the reason given by the astrologers for the good works mentioned in § 28.

[^25]: (133:2) The demon of thunder (see Bd. VII, 12).

[^26]: (133:3) The lightning (see Bd. XVII, 1).

[^27]: (133:4) The demon of drought (see Bd. VII, 8, 10, 12, XXVIII, 39). These two conflicts represent the struggle between rain and drought, which culminates in the thunderstorm; Tî<i>s</i>tar (Sirius) being the bringer of rain.

[^28]: (133:5) So in AK, PB3, MH19, but other MSS. have mâr, ‘serpent,’ instead of mar, though Nêr. uses Sans. n_ri_<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa.

[^29]: (133:6) Which is manifest in the world around us.

[^30]: (135:1) Nêr. has ‘of the trap’ in Sanskrit. The Pâz. dãm, meaning both ‘creature’ and ‘trap.’

[^31]: (135:2) Reading bûn ga<i>s</i>tak instead of bûn ya<i>s</i>tak, as the word has evidently no reference to any form of worship. It cannot be translated ‘original perversion’ (a possible meaning of the word) because there are two of them (see § 103 and Chap. VIII, 101), one competing with the other (see Chap. VIII, 1), which, as one of them is here said to be evil, implies that the other is good and cannot, therefore, be a perversion; nor would this term be applicable in Chap. VI, 6 or XV, 56.

[^32]: (135:3) Or it may be ‘primitive,’ as kâdmon is the Huzvâri<i>s</i> form of the Pâz. khâmast (superlative of Pers. ‘<i>h</i>âm, ‘immature’) here used.

[^33]: (135:4) So in all the older MSS., but in Sans. it ‘_is_ the long-time lord,’ a common Avesta epithet of ‘time,’ and this alteration has been introduced into JE, R, and a few other modern MSS.

[^34]: (135:5) Assuming that Pâz. awâ<i>z</i> stands for <i>e</i>wâ<i>z</i>. The word is omitted by Sans., K28, L15.

[^35]: (136:1) As stated in § 72.

[^36]: (136:2) Reading adîna<i>s</i>, ‘then for it,’ which is the original Pahlavi indicated by the Pâz. ainâ of Nêr. (see Mkh. IX, 6 n).

[^37]: (136:3) See § 12.

[^38]: (136:4) Compare Chap. XII, 79.

[^39]: (137:1) Nêr. divides the word gan<i>g</i>ôbar, ‘treasurer,’ into the three words gan<i>g</i> u bar, ‘treasure and produce.’ These treasurers are the female spirits who meet the soul after death, with its stores of good works and sins (see Dd. XXIV, 5, XXV, 5), and symbolize its good and bad conscience, represented by a beautiful maiden and a frightful hag, respectively.

[^40]: (137:2) The accuser is any person or thing of the good creation that has been injured by any sin, and who must be satisfied by atonement before the sin can be remitted. The question, therefore, to be settled, when the account of the soul is rendered, is whether its good works are sufficient to atone for its sins. In this case the treasurer of offences represents the accusers.

[^41]: (137:3) The treasurer of good works.

[^42]: (137:4) That is, to the torments of hell.

[^43]: (137:5) Either the treasurer of its good works, or the good works themselves.

[^44]: (138:1) Compare Chap. XII, 59.

[^45]: (138:2) Assuming that Pâz. <i>g</i>umê is a misreading of Huz. yôm-1.

[^46]: (138:3) Compare § 61.

[^47]: (138:4) See § 73 n, Chaps. V, 46-IX, 45.

[^48]: (138:5) Chap. V.

[^49]: (138:6) Chap. X.

[^50]: (138:7) Chap. I, 44.

[^51]: (138:8) It is doubtful whether this dîni-i-khard was the name of a book now unknown, as the phrase admits of reasonable translation.

[^52]: (138:9) This writer is also mentioned in Chaps. I, 38, IX, 2, X, 52, but his name has not yet been found elsewhere. As he does not p. 139 appear to be mentioned in that portion of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> known to be extant, his writings were probably embodied in the first two books of that work, which have not yet been discovered.

[^53]: (139:1) The most extensive Pahlavi work in existence, of which only Books III-IX are extant; they contain about 170,000 words and are a summary of the religious opinions, customs, legends, and literature of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, compiled probably in or before the eighth century of the Christian era from earlier records.

[^54]: (139:2) An early editor of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, ‘acts of the religion.’ His selections from various religious writings form the fourth and fifth books of that work. He appears to have been succeeded in the editorship by his son Zaratû<i>s</i>t.
