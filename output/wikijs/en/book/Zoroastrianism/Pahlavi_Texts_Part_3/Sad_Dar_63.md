## SAD DAR. CHAPTER LXIII.

1\. The sixty-third subject is this, that it is necessary to practise strict abstinence from adultery on this account, that _through_ every one who beguiles the wife of another, and commits iniquity with her, that woman becomes, in a moment, unlawful as regards _her_ husband. 2. And, after that, every time her husband comes round about her, it is just as though she had gone near to a strange man. 3. The righteous bestowal [^1] _of herself_ on her own husband, in this <span id="p325"><sup><small>[ p. 325 ]</small></sup></span> situation, is always worse _than his going_ [^2] with women of a different religion, on this account, that, if that wife becomes pregnant, it is just as though one of the good religion had fallen _away_ into a different religion, and [^3] thereby that man becomes worthy of death.

4\. And it also happens, when that wife becomes pregnant, _that_ she _may_ effect the slaughter of the infant, from fear of a bad reputation. 5. Then, _for_ that person whose child it is, it is just as though he had effected the slaughter of the child with his own hand; therefore, he is worthy of death. 6. If the infant be born, and it remains [^4] in the religion, every sin that that child of his commits is, for that person, just as though it were committed by his own hand.

7\. And if a woman of those of the good religion commits _adultery_, she becomes in a condition unlawful as regards _her_ husband; _and_ if an infant be born it is illegitimate. 8. And the sin owing to this will depart _at_ the time when that person goes near to her husband _and_ shall say: ‘What is _there_ in me befitting thy wife? 9. A calamity (âk) _has_ occurred, and a crime (‘<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>â) _has_ come into _my_ body; thou knowest if thou _wilt_ exercise forgiveness (’hafû), and if not, when _it is_ not for me, do thou kill _me_; my blood is lawful (‘halâl) unto thee.’ 10. If he shall kill her, her sin will depart owing to this; <span id="p326"><sup><small>[ p. 326 ]</small></sup></span> otherwise, this sin will not depart from her in any manner (navaî) [^5].

11\. And _one_ calls this sin a sin _affecting_ antagonists [^6], _and_, so long as the antagonist does not become satisfied, the sin flows on [^7], _and_ they keep his soul back at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, till the time that its antagonist shall arrive and himself accomplishes _his_ antagonism, and they give him back a reply [^8].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (324:4) Lp inserts ‘he shall wish.’

[^2]: (325:1) B29 has ‘it never becomes a righteous bestowal of herself on _her_ husband, and if, in this situation, he is also.’

[^3]: (325:2) B29 omits ‘and.’

[^4]: (325:3) Lp, B29 have ‘it does not remain,’ but the text seems to be assuming that the illicit origin of the child is unsuspected, in which case it would undoubtedly remain in the religion, as it would probably do in any case.

[^5]: (326:1) B29 omits these eleven words.

[^6]: (326:2) Or accusers (see-Chap. XLII, 1, 2).

[^7]: (326:3) B29 has ‘it flows on,’ if we read bi-rêzad; but the Gu<i>g</i>arâti translator seems to take gunâh-barêza<i>d</i> (Av. bereza<i>n</i>t) as a technical epithet for the soul, as though he would say ‘they keep back the soul of him _whose_ sin is rampant.’

[^8]: (326:4) That is, the investigating angels announce their decision as to the proper fate of the soul they have detained.
