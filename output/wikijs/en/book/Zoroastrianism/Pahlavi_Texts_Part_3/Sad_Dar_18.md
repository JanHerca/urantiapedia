## SAD DAR. CHAPTER XVIII.

1\. The eighteenth subject is this, that it is necessary for mankind to make an endeavour, so that they _may_ espouse a wife in _their_ youth and beget a child. 2. And for women, in like manner, it is necessary that _there_ should be a longing (ra_gh_bat) for espousing a husband.

3\. Because it is declared in revelation [^1], _that_ every duty and good work a child performs becomes the father's and mother's, just like those which they have performed with their own hands. 4. The meaning (ma’hnî) of pûr (‘a son’) is that which signifies pûl (‘a bridge’) [^2], for by this bridge they arrive at that _other_ world. 5. If _there_ be no child for any one they call _him one with_ a severed bridge, that is, the <span id="p279"><sup><small>[ p. 279 ]</small></sup></span> way for him _to_ that _other_ world is severed, and he is not able to attain to that world. 6. At the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge he shall remain; although he has performed much duty and good works he is not able to make a passage over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, and they do not make up his account and reckoning. 7. And every archangel that comes forward _to_ that place first asks these words, that is, ‘Hast thou brought thy own substitute visibly into the world, or not?’ 8. When he has not brought _it_, they will pass over him, and his soul will remain, _in_ that place [^3], full of anguish and grief (_gh_am).

9\. A similitude (miTHâl) of it is like that which _happens when_ any one may be in a wilderness, and _there_ may be fear of wild animals and creatures, and near to him may be his own town, _but_ a river of water is in front [^4], and it is not possible to make a passage over that river, _as_ a bridge is fallen in, and he is not able to arrive at that town, _but_ he is always upon the bank (sar<i>t</i>) _speaking_ thus [^5]: ‘Would that the bridge would become perfect!’

10\. The duty as to children [^6] is in this aggregate [^7]. 11. Therefore, the creator Hôrmazd _has_ granted unto men that, if _there_ be any one to whom sickness from heaven may occur, and _there_ be no provision of a child for him, he _has_ commanded him that he _should_ make some one a son of his own, as [^8] a friend of _his_ soul, and _should_ receive a child, because every duty _can be_ delegated. 12. That person is in place of a <span id="p280"><sup><small>[ p. 280 ]</small></sup></span> child, and every duty and good work that he performs shall be just like that _which_ is performed by one's own hand.

13\. And, finally, if any one departs from the world (dunyâ) [^9] and possesses no adopted child, it is incumbent on the priests and high-priests and his relations to appoint his adopted son, and it is necessary to bring some one in sight on that account, so that his soul _may_ spring away from the torment of hell. 14. Because, every time that his relations do not pay attention _to this_, when they proceed to that _other_ world, the soul of that person hangs about them and speaks thus: ‘I left with you something that I had collected and borne trouble for in many years, and you seized upon _it_, and put _it_ into your own expenditure (‘<i>h</i>arg), and did not seek for [^10] mercy (<i>s</i>afqat) on my soul. 15. _In_ the same manner as I have remained, delayed (maûqûf) _in_ this place, I _will_ not let you pass; so that you _will_ make no passage over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge till the sacred being takes my rights away from you.’ 16. Then the angel Rashn and the angel Mihir [^11] make up their reckoning, _and, as to_ whatever those persons have seized upon from the _other's_ property [^12], for every single dînâr the account makes four, and they take away the equivalent. 17. And, _as_ in that world _there_ are no gold and silver, they take away from their souls the good works that they have done, and they give _them_ to the soul of this _other_. 18. Still, while _others_ do not appoint the adopted son, they are not able to pass over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, nor to arrive at their own station. <span id="p281"><sup><small>[ p. 281 ]</small></sup></span> 19\. There is no duty whatever more incumbent on relations than this duty, and every time that they appoint an adopted son _for_ any one it is just as though they have made the deceased alive; and there are no limit (‘hadd) and end (nihâyat) of their good works.
