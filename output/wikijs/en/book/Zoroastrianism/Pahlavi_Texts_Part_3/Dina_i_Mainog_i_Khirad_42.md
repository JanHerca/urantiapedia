## DÎNÂ-Î MAÎNÔG-Î KHIRA<i>D</i>. CHAPTER XLII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: ‘How many kinds of man are _there?_’

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: '_There_ are three kinds of man, (5) one is man, one is demi-man, and one is demi-demon.

6\. 'A man is he who is without doubt as to the creativeness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the destructiveness of Aharman, and the existence of the resurrection and future existence; and also _as regards_ every other happiness and misery, in the worldly and spiritual <span id="p83"><sup><small>[ p. 83 ]</small></sup></span> _existences_, (7) that _its_ origin is from both of those _beings_, from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Aharman. 8. And his belief is in this one pure, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers; (9) and he does not believe in, and does not hearken unto, any heterodoxy.

10\. 'A demi-man is he who performs the affairs of the worldly, and spiritual _existences_ according to his own opinion, self-conceitedly and obstinately; (11) be they duties and good works by the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _or_ be they by the will of Aharman, they proceed from him.

12\. ‘A demi-demon is he in whom _there_ is only as _it were_ the name of man [^1] and the human race, _but_ in his doing of every action _he_ is then like unto a two-legged demon. 13. He understands no worldly and no spiritual _existence_, (14) he understands no good work and no sin, (15) he understands no heaven and no hell, (16) and even the account which is _to be rendered_ by the soul he does not think of.’
