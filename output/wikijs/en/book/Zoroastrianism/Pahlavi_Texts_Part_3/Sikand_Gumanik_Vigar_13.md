## <i>S</i>IKAND-GÛMÂNÎK VI<i>G</i>ÂR. CHAPTER XIII.

1\. Again, about the inconsistency and faulty statements of the first scripture [^3], (2) which they call holy (â<i>z</i>â<i>d</i>)—(3) and as to it they are, _in_ every way, unanimous that the sacred being wrote _it_ with his own hand, _and_ gave _it_ to Moses (Mûshâê)—(4) so that, as _it_ is full of delusion, I _will_ here publish, for your information, a story [^4] out of all _its_ stupidity and of much that is in it.

5\. It states, in the beginning _of_ the scripture, (6) that _there_ first arose earth, without form and void [^5], <span id="p209"><sup><small>[ p. 209 ]</small></sup></span> darkness, and black water; (7) and the breathing [^1] of the sacred being ever yearns [^2] over the face of that black water [^3]. 8. Afterwards the sacred being spoke thus: ‘Let _there_ be light,’ (9) and _there_ was light [^4]. 10. And stooping he considered that light below him, (11) and the light _was_ transmitted by him to the day, and the darkness to the night [^5]. 12. In six days this world and sky _and_ earth _were_ also created by him, (13) for during the seventh day he was reposing (khaspân) and comfortable [^6]. 14. Through that same mystery (râ<i>z</i>) even now the Jews are enjoying repose _on_ the Sabbath day [^7].

15\. This, too, _is stated_, that Adam and his wife Eve (Havâê) _were_ created by him, (16) _and_ put into a garden of paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t); (17) so that Adam <span id="p210"><sup><small>[ p. 210 ]</small></sup></span> should perform cultivation in that garden, and should keep watch [^1]. 18. The Lord [^2], who is the sacred being himself, commanded Adam (19) thus: ‘Eat of every tree which is in this garden, except of that tree of knowledge; (20) because when you eat thereof you die [^3].’ 21. Afterwards a serpent _was_ also put by him into the garden; (22) _and_ that serpent deceived Eve _and_ spoke thus: ‘_Let_ us eat of the gathering from this tree, _and let_ us give _it_ to Adam [^4].’ 23. And she acted accordingly, (24) and Adam likewise ate [^5]. 25. And _his_ knowledge became such that good _was_ distinguished by him from evil, and they did not die [^6]. 26. He also saw and knew that he was naked, (27) _and_ became concealed under the trees; (28) he likewise covered over his own body _with_ leaves of trees, on account of the shame of nakedness [^7]. 29. Afterwards the Lord went to the <span id="p211"><sup><small>[ p. 211 ]</small></sup></span> garden, _and_ called Adam by name thus: ‘Where art thou [^1]?’ 30. Adam replied thus: ‘Here I am, under the trees, for this reason, because I am naked [^2].’ 31. The Lord indulged _in_ wrath, (32) _and_ spoke thus: ‘Who could have informed _thee_ that thou art naked? 33. Mayest thou not ever yet [^3] _have_ eaten of that tree of knowledge, _of_ which I said that you shall not eat [^4]?’ 34. Adam spoke thus: ‘I have _been_ deceived _by_ this woman, who _was_ given to me by thee, and I ate [^5].’ 35. And the Lord enquired of Eve thus: ‘Why _was_ it so done by thee?’ 36. Eve spoke thus: ‘I have _been_ deceived _by_ this serpent [^6].’ 37. And Adam and Eve and the serpent are, all three, forced out of the garden of paradise by him with a curse [^7]. 38. And he spoke to Adam thus: ‘Thy eating shall be through the scraping off of sweat [^8] <span id="p212"><sup><small>[ p. 212 ]</small></sup></span> and the panting of the nostrils, (39) until the end of thy life; (40) and thy land shall grow all bodily refuse and dung [^1].’ 41. He also spoke to Eve thus: ‘Thy pregnancy shall be in pain and uneasy, and thy bringing forth in grievous hastening [^2].’ 42. And he spoke to the serpent thus: ‘Thou shalt be accursed from amid the quadrupeds and wild animals of the plain and mountain; (43) for thee also _there_ shall be no feet, (44) and thy movement shall be on _thy_ belly, and _thy_ food dust. 45. And betwixt thy offspring, with _those of_ the woman, _there_ shall be such hatred and conversion to enmity that they _will_ wound the head of that offspring [^3].’

46\. This, too, they say, that this worldly _existence_, with whatever is in everything, was made and produced by him for mankind; (47) and man _was_ made by him predominant over all creatures and creations, wet and dry [^4].

48\. Now I _will_ tell _you_ a story (nisang-1) about <span id="p213"><sup><small>[ p. 213 ]</small></sup></span> the contents of their twaddle and the faultiness of their statements, (49) that is, where and with what limits did that earth without form and void [^1], the darkness, the sacred being and his breathing [^2], and the black water arise? 50. Or _of_ what description was the sacred being himself? 51. _It is_ manifest that he was not light, (52) because, when the light was seen by him, (53) stooping he considered _it_ [^3], for the reason that he had not seen it _before_. 54. If they say that he was dark, that manifestly _implies_ that the origin of darkness is uttering [^4] a word _and_ there is light. 55. If they say that he was not dark, but light, (56) why, when the light _was_ seen by him, did he admire _and_ consider it, though he was light himself? 57. And if they say that he was neither light nor dark, (58) it is necessary for such to specify that third _state_ which is not light and not dark.

59\. Then _as to_ him whose position and abode were in darkness and black water, and light was never seen by him, how was it possible for him to look _at_ that light? 60. And what _was_ his divinity owing to? 61. Because even now _it_ is not possible for any one who remains in darkness to look _at_ the light. 62. _Observe_ also this, that if his origin and abode were darkness, how was it possible for him to remain opposite the light? 63. Because this is known, that _it_ is not possible _for_ darkness to remain opposite the light, since _the latter_ puts it aside harmless.

64\. Again, _I ask_ this, that is, was that earth, which <span id="p214"><sup><small>[ p. 214 ]</small></sup></span> _was_ without form and void, limited or unlimited? 65. If it were limited, what was there outside of it? 66. If it were unlimited, whither did that unlimitedness of it go, (67) when, as we see, this earth and worldly _existence_ are not those of the first existence?

68\. _As to_ that which the Lord spoke, (69) that is: ‘Let _there_ be light,’ and it was _so_, (70) it is thereupon appropriate to understand that the Lord _existed_ before the _time_ that the light arose; (71) _and_ when he was wishing to make the light, and he gave the command for it to arise, he then considered mentally _in_ what way the light is of good appearance or evil appearance. 72. And if the light, through its own nature, reached into the knowledge and consideration of the Lord, it is evident that the light was existing alike within the knowledge and mind of the Lord, (73) and alike outside of him. 74. For it is not possible to know and obtain anything, unless _it be_ a manifestation of an existence. 75. If the light was existing is it [^1], on that account, a creation of the Lord? 76. And if they say that the light was not, through its own nature, within _his_ knowledge, that light _was_ demanded by him, who did not know of what nature _it was_, very unwisely. 77. Or how is it possible to consider in the mind that which one _has_ never even thought of _or_ known?

78\. And _observe_ this, too, that that command for the arising of light _was_ given _either_ to something or to nothing, (79) because this is certain, that it is necessary to give a command to a performer of commands. 80. If _it were_ given by him to something existing, which _was_ light, that _implies that_ the light <span id="p215"><sup><small>[ p. 215 ]</small></sup></span> itself existed. 81. And if the command _were_ given by him, to something not existing, then how did the something not existing hear the command of the Lord? 82. Or how did it know that the will of the Lord _was_ thus, that ‘I _should_ become light?’ 83. Because the command of the Lord is not heard _by what_ does not exist, in the same manner as though _it were_ not given by him. 84. Since it is not possible _for_ the non-existent even to think in any way, (85) _it was_ that which is appointed nonexistent, so that it does not exist, but _yet_ exists [^1], that was really before the sight of the sage [^2]; by which _it was_ known _in_ what manner the Lord is demanding that it _shall_ arise [^3], _and_ in the manner which was demanded by him it arose.

86\. If they say that the light arose from the word of the Lord, which _was_ spoken by him thus: ‘Thou shalt arise,’ and it was _so_—(87) that _being_ when the Lord and his belongings (khû<i>d</i>îh) were dark, and light had really never _been_ seen by him—_in_ what way is it possible _for_ that light to arise from _his_ word? 88. Because this is known, that speaking is the progeny of thinking. 89. If they say that his word became light, that is very marvellous, because then light is the fruit of darkness, and the source of darkness is thereby the essence of light; <span id="p216"><sup><small>[ p. 216 ]</small></sup></span> or _else it is_ this, that the light was concealed in the darkness.

90\. As I _have_ said [^1], it is evident that it is of no use to give a command, except _to_ a performer of commands, (91) so that it should be _that_ the light existed, _and_ then the command was expedient _and_ given.

92\. Again, _I ask_ this, _as to_ these creatures and creations, sky _and_ earth of his, since _they were_ prepared and produced by him in six days, (93) _and_ the seventh he reposed (khaspî<i>d</i>) therefrom [^2], (94) then, when this world _was_ not produced by him from anything, but merely arose by his command, ‘thou shalt arise,’ and it was _so_, (95) to what _was_ that delay of his of six days owing? 96. For when his trouble is merely as much as to say ‘thou shalt arise,’ the existence of that delay of six days is very ill-seeming. 97. It is also not suitable for trouble to arise for him therefrom. 98. If it be possible to make the non-existent exist, and _he be_ capable _of it_, it is possible to produce _it_ even a long time back. 99. And if _he be_ incapable of producing except in the period of a day, it is not fitting to speak of his producing it from nothing.

100\. And, again, _I ask_ this, that is, when the number of the days should be known from the sun, whence then is the number of the day, besides the names of the days, known before the creation of the sun? 101. For they say that the sun _was_ produced by him _on_ the fourth day, which is itself Wednesday [^3]. <span id="p217"><sup><small>[ p. 217 ]</small></sup></span> 102\. <i>I</i> also _ask_ this, to what _was it_ owing that it was necessary for him to make _himself_ comfortable _and_ reposing _on_ the seventh day? 103. When the delay and trouble in his creation and production of the world was _merely_ so much as _that_ he spoke thus: ‘Thou shalt arise,’ (104) how are those days accounted _for_ by him, so that it was necessary to make him reposing whose trouble is recounted? 105. For if ‘thou shalt arise’ _were_ spoken by him at once, that is his trouble, and he ought to become comfortable immediately.

106\. Again _I ask_ this, that is, for what purpose and cause is Adam produced by him, _together_ with Eve [^1], (107) so that while they practise his will [^2], the purpose of it is not so presented by him that they shall not turn _away_ from the performance of his desire? 108. For when it is known by him, before the fact, that they _will_ not be listening _to_ his command, and _yet they_ are finally produced by him, that _shows that_ for him now to become exhausted, and to indulge in wrath about them, is unreasonable, (109) because _it_ is evident that the Lord himself was not fully proceeding _with that_ which is desirable for his own will, and is manifestly an opponent and adversary to his own will. 110. If they are not understood by him before the fact, and it is not even known by him that they _will_ not listen _to_ his command, then he is ignorant and badly informed. 111. If they say that his will itself was for non-performance, why then is the command for performance given by him? 112. Also what is the sin in not performing <span id="p218"><sup><small>[ p. 218 ]</small></sup></span> it, and how goes (113) a horse whom they yoke with _another_ in confinement (lag) and hurry on with a whip (tâ<i>z</i>ânak) [^1]. 114. From this statement signs and tokens of deceivers are manifested, (115) whose will and command are inconsistent _and_ unadapted, one to the other.

116\. And if his will and desire were this, that they _shall_ not turn _away_ from his will, (117) still their power and desire for turning _away_ from his will are much stronger and more resistant than those which he _gave_ for not turning. 118. If the will for their turning _away_ from his will, and also the knowledge of it, were his, and the command for not turning _away were_ given by him, how was it still possible _for_ the distressed Adam _to act_ so that they _should_ not turn _away?_ 119. Also, the origin and maintenance of his will ought not to exist, (120) because by turning _away_ from his command _one_ merely falsifies (drû<i>g</i>e<i>d</i>) it as a command, _while_ by not turning _away_ it becomes a falsification of both _his_ will and knowledge.

121\. Again, _I ask_ this, that is, on what account and for what advantage _was_ that garden, prepared by him, produced [^2]? 122. And _as to_ the tree of knowledge itself, about which he commanded thus: ‘Ye shall not eat _of it_,’ and also _as to_ the injunction for not eating _of it_, which _was_ issued by him, why was it necessary for him to make them?

123\. _It_ is also evident, from his injunction and <span id="p219"><sup><small>[ p. 219 ]</small></sup></span> command, that scanty knowledge and ignorance are more loved by him, (124) and _his_ desire for them is more than _for_ knowledge and wisdom. 125. And _that_ even his advantage from ignorance was more, (126) because while the tree of knowledge was not tasted by them they were ignorant, and not disobedient and without benefit unto him, (127) _but_ just as their knowledge arose they became disobedient unto him. 128. _There_ was also no anxiety for him from their ignorance, _but_ just as their knowledge arose (129) he became exhausted and wrathful about them, (130) and, forced out of paradise by him, with grievous discomfort and disgrace, they are cast [^1] to the earth. (131) The sum total is this, that the cause of this birth of man's knowledge, in the worldly _existence_, was owing to the serpent and deceit.

132\. They also say this, that things of every kind _were_ created for mankind—on account of which _it_ is evident that even that tree _was_ created by him for mankind—(133) and man _was_ made by him predominant over every creature and creation [^2]. 134. If that be so, why _were they_ now to incline _their_ desires _away_ from that tree which was their own?

135\. From this _following_ statement this, too, is evident, that knowledge was not really originating with him, (136) because if he came forth to the garden [^3] and raised his voice, and called Adam by name thus: ‘Where art thou,’ _it_ is just as though he were unaware of the place where he existed; (137) _and_ if he had been unanswered by him, _he would have_ been unaware of the place where Adam existed. 138. If it were not owing to his (a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>) <span id="p220"><sup><small>[ p. 220 ]</small></sup></span> outcry, too, before seeing _him, he would have_ been unaware that he _had_ eaten of that tree, or not; _and of_ this also, that is, _by_ whom and how _it was done_, who ate and who deceived. 139. If he were aware, why _had he_ to make that enquiry of him, ‘mayest thou not ever yet _have_ eaten of that tree, _of_ which I commanded that you shall not eat [^1]?’ 140. And at first, when he came forth, he was not exhausted, _but_ afterwards, when he knew that _they had_ eaten, he became exhausted about them and was wrathful.

141\. His scanty knowledge is also _evident_ from this, when he created the serpent, which _was_ itself his adversary, and put _it_ into the garden with them [^2]; (142) or _else_ why _was_ not the garden made so fortified by him, that the serpent, and also other enemies, should thereby not go into it?

143\. Even his falsity is also evident from this, when he spoke thus: ‘When you eat of this tree you die [^3];’ and they _have_ eaten and are not dead, but have become really intelligent, (144) and good is well recognised from evil by them.

145\. <i>I</i> also _ask_ this, that is, how is his knowledge inconsistent _and_ competing with _his_ will and command? 146. For if _it were_ willed by him to eat of that tree, and the command for not eating _were_ given by him, the knowledge about it was that _the fruit would be_ eaten. 147. Now _it_ is evident that the will, knowledge, and command are all three inconsistent, one towards the other.

148\. This, too, _is evident_, that, though Adam committed sin, the curse which _was_ inflicted by Him (the Lord) [^4] reaches unlawfully over people of every kind <span id="p221"><sup><small>[ p. 221 ]</small></sup></span> at various periods, (149) _and_ I consider _it_, in every way, a senseless, ignorant, and foolish statement.

150\. On this subject, on account of tediousness, thus much is considered complete.

## Footnotes

[^3]: (208:3) The Old Testament.

[^4]: (208:4) Pâz. niha<i>n</i>g-<i>e</i> (Pahl. nisang-1, Av. ni + sangha) appears to mean ‘a tale, tract, or essay,’ and is connected with farhang, ‘learning.’ Sans. has ‘somewhat, a little.’

[^5]: (208:5) Assuming that Pâz. âv khûn u tãn (which Nêr. seems to have understood as âv-i khûn-vatãn, ‘water containing blood’) is a misreading of Pahl. afâm va tahân. Nêr. may have been thinking of Mkh. IX, 8.

[^1]: (209:1) Reading vâyâ, ‘air; breath,’ instead of Pâz. vakhsh, ‘growth, expanse;’ these two words being written alike in Pahlavi. Sans. has ‘eyes.’

[^2]: (209:2) Reading nîyâ<i>z</i>ê<i>d</i> instead of Pâz. nyâve<i>d</i>. Sans. has ‘looks.’

[^3]: (209:3) ‘In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness _was_ upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters’ (Gen. i. i, 2).

[^4]: (209:4) ‘And God said, “Let there be light:” and there was light’ (Gen. i. 3).

[^5]: (209:5) ‘And God saw the light, that _it was_ good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night’ (Gen. i. 4, 5).

[^6]: (209:6) ‘And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. . . . And he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made’ (Gen. i. 31; ii. I, 2).

[^7]: (209:7) ‘But the seventh day _is_ the sabbath of the Lord thy God: _in it_ thou shalt not do any work. . . . For _in_ six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them _is_, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it’ (Ex. xx. 10, 11).

[^1]: (210:1) ‘So God created man in his _own_ image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. . . . And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it’ (Gen. i. 27; ii. 15).

[^2]: (210:2) Pâz. âdînô is evidently a misreading of the Pahlavi form of Heb. adonâi, ‘Lord.’

[^3]: (210:3) ‘And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die”’ (Gen. ii. 16, 17).

[^4]: (210:4) ‘Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, . . . ye shall not surely die"’ (Gen. iii. I, 4).

[^5]: (210:5) ‘She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat’ (Gen. iii. 6).

[^6]: (210:6) ‘“For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil”’ (Gen. iii. 5).

[^7]: (210:7) ‘And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they _were_ naked: and they sewed fig leaves together, and made p. 211 themselves aprons . . . and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God, amongst the trees of the garden’ (Gen. iii. 7, 8).

[^1]: (211:1) ‘And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. . . . And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, “Where _art_ thou?”’ (Gen. iii. 8, 9).

[^2]: (211:2) ‘And he said, “I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I _was_ naked; and I hid myself”’ (Gen. iii. 8, 9).

[^3]: (211:3) Assuming that Pâz. agarat stands for Pahl. akvari<i>k</i>at; see § 139.

[^4]: (211:4) ‘And he said, “Who told thee that thou _wast_ naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?”’ (Gen. iii. II).

[^5]: (211:5) ‘And the man said, “The woman whom thou gavest _to be_ with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat”’ (Gen. iii. 12).

[^6]: (211:6) ‘And the Lord God said unto the woman, “What _is_ this _that_ thou hast done?” And the woman said, “The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat”’ (Gen. iii. 13).

[^7]: (211:7) ‘Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man’ (Gen. iii. 23, 24).

[^8]: (211:8) Sans. has ‘through the spreading of sleep.’

[^1]: (212:1) ‘And unto Adam he said, “. . . cursed _is_ the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat _of_ it all the days of thy life: thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; . . . in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground ”’ (Gen. iii. 17-19).

[^2]: (212:2) ‘Unto the woman he said, “I will greatly multiply thy sorrow, and thy conception: in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ”’ (Gen. iii. 16).

[^3]: (212:3) ‘And the Lord God said unto the serpent, “Because thou hast done this, thou _art_ cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel ”’ (Gen. iii. 14, 15).

[^4]: (212:4) ‘And God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth”’ (Gen. i. 26).

[^1]: (213:1) See § 6 n.

[^2]: (213:2) See § 7 n.

[^3]: (213:3) See § 10. The scripture merely says that ‘God saw the light, that _it was_ good;’ but this difference does not really affect the author's argument as to the previous non-existence of light.

[^4]: (213:4) Assuming that Pâz. frâi is a misreading of Pahl. parâ<i>s</i>.
