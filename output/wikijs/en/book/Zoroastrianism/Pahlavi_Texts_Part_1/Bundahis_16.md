## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XVI.

1\. On the nature of generation it says in revelation, that a woman when she comes out from menstruation, during ten days and nights, when they go near unto her, soon becomes pregnant. 2. When she is cleansed from her menstruation, _and_ when the time for pregnancy has come, always when the seed of the man is the more powerful a son arises from it; when that of the woman is the more powerful, a daughter; when both seeds are equal, twins and triplets. 3. If the male seed comes the sooner, it adds to the female, and she becomes robust; if the female seed comes the sooner, it becomes blood, _and_ the leanness of the female _arises_ therefrom.

4\. The female seed is cold and moist, and _its_ flow is from the loins, and the colour is white, red, and yellow; and the male seed is hot and dry, _its_ flow is from the brain of the head, _and_ the colour is white and mud-coloured (ha<i>s</i>gûn). 5. All [^1] the seed of the females _which_ issues beforehand, takes a place within the womb, and the seed of the males will remain above it, _and_ will fill the space of the womb; whatever refrains therefrom becomes blood again, enters into the veins of the females, _and_ at the time any one is born it becomes milk and'

nourishes him, as all milk arises from the seed of the males, _and_ the blood is that of the females.

6\. These four things, they say, are male, _and these_ female: the sky, metal, wind, _and_ fire are male, and are never otherwise; the water, earth, plants, _and_ fish are female, _and_ are never otherwise; the remaining creation consists of male and female.

7\. As regards the fish [^1] it says that, at the time of excitement, they go forwards and come back in the water, two _and_ two, the length of a mile (hâsar), which is one-fourth of a league (parasang), in the running water; in that coming _and_ going they then rub _their_ bodies _together_, and a kind of sweat drops out betwixt them, and _both_ become pregnant.
