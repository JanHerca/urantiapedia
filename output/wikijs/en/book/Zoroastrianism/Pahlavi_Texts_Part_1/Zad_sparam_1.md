## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER I.

THEY call these memoranda _and_ writings the Selections (<i>k</i>î<i>d</i>akîhâ) of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, son of Yûdân-Yim.

0\. In propitiation of the creator Aûharmazd and all the angels—who are the whole of the heavenly and earthly sacred beings (yazdân)—_are_ the sayings of Herbad Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, son of Yûdân-Yim, who is of the south [^1], about the meeting of the beneficent spirit _and_ the evil spirit.

1\. It is in scripture thus declared, that light _was_ above and darkness below, and between those two was open space. 2. Aûharmazd _was_ in the light, and Aharman in the darkness [^2]; Aûharmazd _was_ aware of the existence of Aharman and of _his_ coming for strife; Aharman was not aware of the existence of light _and_ of Aûharmazd [^3]. 3. It happened to Aharman, in the gloom _and_ darkness, _that_ <span id="p156"><sup><small>[ p. 156 ]</small></sup></span> he was walking humbly (frô-tanû) on the borders, _and_ meditating other _things_ he came up to the top, and a ray of light was seen by him; and because of _its_ antagonistic nature to him he strove that he might reach it, so that it might also be within his absolute power. 4. And as he came forth to the boundary, accompanied by certain others [^4], Aûharmazd came forth to the struggle for keeping Aharman away from His territory; and He did it through pure words, confounding witchcraft, and cast him back to the gloom.

5\. For protection from the fiend (drû<i>g</i>,) the spirits rushed in, the spirits of the sky, water, earth, plants, animals, mankind, and fire He _had_ appointed, and they maintained it (the protection) three thousand years. 6. Aharman, also, ever collected means in the gloom; and at the end of the three thousand years he, came back to the boundary, blustered (patîstâ<i>d</i>), and exclaimed thus: ‘I _will_ smite thee, I _will_ smite the creatures which thou thinkest _have_ produced fame for thee—thee who art the beneficent spirit—I will destroy everything about them.’

7\. Aûharmazd answered thus: ‘Thou art not a doer of everything, O fiend [^5]!’

8\. And, again, Aharman retorted thus: ‘I will seduce all material life into disaffection to thee and affection to myself [^6].’

9\. Aûharmazd perceived, through the spirit of wisdom, thus: ‘Even the blustering of Aharman is capable of performance, if I do not allow disunion <span id="p157"><sup><small>[ p. 157 ]</small></sup></span> (lâ barînînam) during a period of struggle.’ 10. And he demanded of him a period for friendship [^7], for it was seen by him that Aharman does not rely upon the intervention of any vigorous ones, _and_ the existence of a period is obtaining the benefit of the mutual friendship _and_ just arrangement of both; and he formed it into three periods, each period being three millenniums. 11. Aharman relied upon _it_, and Aûharmazd perceived that, though it is not possible to have Aharman sent down, ever when he wants he goes back to his own requisite, which is darkness; _and_ from the poison which is much diffused endless strife arises [^8].

12\. And after the period was appointed by him, he brought forward the Ahûnavar _formula_ [^9]; and in his Ahûnavar these [^10] kinds of benefit were shown:—13. The first is that, of all things, that is proper which is something declared _as_ the will of Aûharmazd; so that, whereas that is proper which is declared the will of Aûharmazd, where anything exists which is not within the will of Aûharmazd, it is created injurious from the beginning, a sin of a distinct nature. 14. The second is this, that whoever shall do that which is the will of Aûharmazd, his reward _and_ recompense are his own; and of him who shall not do that which is the will of Aûharmazd, the punishment at the bridge, [^11] owing thereto <span id="p158"><sup><small>[ p. 158 ]</small></sup></span> is his own; which is shown from this [^12] _formula; and_ the reward of doers of good works, the punishment of sinners, and the tales of heaven _and_ hell are from it. 15. Thirdly, _it is_ shown that the sovereignty of Aûharmazd increases that which is for the poor, _and_ adversity is removed; by which _it_ is shown that there are treasures for the needy _one, and_ treasures are to be _his_ friends; as the intelligent creations _are_ to the unintelligent, so also _are_ the treasures of a wealthy _person_ to a needy _one_, treasures liberally given which are his own. 16. And the creatures of the trained hand of Aûharmazd are contending _and_ angry (âr<i>d</i>îk), one with the other, as the renovation _of the universe_ must occur through these three things. 17. That is, first, true religiousness in one self, _and_ reliance upon a man‘s original hold on the truly glad tidings (nav-barhâm), that Aûharmazd is all goodness without vileness, and his will is a will altogether excellent; _and_ Aharman is all vileness without goodness. 18. Secondly, hope of the reward _and_ recompense of good works, serious fear of the bridge _and_ the punishment of crime, strenuous perseverance in good works, _and_ abstaining from sin. 19. Thirdly, the existence of the mutual assistance of the creatures, or along with and owing to mutual assistance, _their_ collective warfare; it is the triumph of warfare over the enemy which is one’s own renovation [^13].

<span id="p159"><sup><small>[ p. 159 ]</small></sup></span>

20\. By this formula he (Aharman) was confounded, _and_ he fell back to the gloom [^14]; _and_ Aûharmazd produced the creatures bodily for the world; first, the sky; the second, water; the third, earth; the fourth, plants; the fifth, animals; the sixth, mankind [^15]. 21. Fire was in all, diffused originally through the six substances, of which it was as much the confiner of each single substance in which it was established, it is said, as an eyelid when they lay one down upon the other.

22\. Three thousand years the creatures were possessed of bodies and not walking on _their_ navels; _and_ the sun, moon, _and_ stars stood still. 23. In the mischievous incursion, at the end of the period, Aûharmazd observed thus: ‘What advantage is there from the creation of a creature, although thirstless, which is unmoving _or_ mischievous?’ <span id="p160"><sup><small>[ p. 160 ]</small></sup></span> 24. And in aid of the _celestial_ sphere he produced the creature Time (zôrvan) [^16]; and Time is unrestricted, so that he made the creatures of Aûharmazd moving, distinct from the motion of Aharman‘s creatures, for the shedders of perfume (bôi-dâ<i>d</i>ân) were standing one opposite to the other while emitting _it_. 25. And, observantly of the end, he brought forward to Aharman a means out of himself, the property of darkness, with which the extreme limits (vîrûnakŏ) of Time _were_ connected by him, an envelope (pôstô) of the black-pated and ash-coloured kind. 26. And in bringing it forward he spoke thus: ’Through their weapons the co-operation of the serpent (a<i>z</i>ŏ) dies away, _and_ this _which_ is thine, indeed thy own daughter, _dies_ through religion; and if at the end of nine thousand years, as it is said _and_ written, is a time of upheaval (madam kar<i>d</i>anŏ), _she is_ upheaved, not ended.'

27\. At the same time Aharman came from accompanying Time out to the front, out to the star station; the connection of the sky with the star station _was_ open, which showed, since it hung down into empty space, the strong communication of the lights and glooms, the place of strife in which is the pursuit of both. 28. And having darkness with himself he brought it into the sky, _and_ left the sky so to gloom that the internal deficiency in the sky extends as much as one-third [^17] over the star station.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (155:1) Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam appears to have been dastûr of Sîrkân, about thirty parasangs south of Kirmân, and one of the most southern districts in Persia (see Ouseley's Oriental Geography, pp. 138, 139, 141, 143-145).

[^2]: (155:2) See Bund. I, 2-4.

[^3]: (155:3) Or ‘of the light of Aûharmazd’ (compare Bund. I, 8, 9).

[^4]: (156:1) Reading pavan <i>k</i>atârânŏ ham-tanû, but the phrase is somewhat doubtful, and rather inconsistent with Bund. I, 10.

[^5]: (156:2) Bund. I, 0.

[^6]: (156:3) Bund. I, 14.

[^7]: (157:1) Bund. I, 17, 18.

[^8]: (157:2) Or ‘the poison of the serpent, which is much diffused, becomes endless strife.’

[^9]: (157:3) Bund. I, 21.

[^10]: (157:4) The word ân, ‘those,’ however, is probably a miswriting of the cipher for ‘three.’

[^11]: (157:5) The <i>K</i>înva<i>d</i> or <i>K</i>învar bridge (see Bund. XII, 7).

[^12]: (158:1) The MS. has hûman, ‘well-meditating,’ instead of denman, ‘this;’ but the two words are much alike in Pahlavi writing.

[^13]: (158:2) This commentary on the Ahûnavar, or Yathâ-ahû-vairyô formula, is rather clumsily interpolated by Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, and is much more elaborate than the usual Pahlavi translation and explanation of this formula, which may be translated as follows:—p. 159
  ‘As is the will of the living spirit (as is the will of Aûharmazd) so should be the pastor (so excellent should he be) owing to whatsoever are the duties and good works of righteousness (the duties and good works should be as excellent as the will of Aûharmazd). Whose is the gift of good thought (that is, the reward _and_ recompense good thought gives, it gives also unto him) which among living spirits is the work of Aûharmazd (that is, they would do that which Aûharmazd requires); there are _some_ who say it is thus: Whose gift is through good thought (that is, the reward _and_ recompense which they will give to good thought, they would give also unto him); Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t said that by the gift of good thought, when among living spirits, they comprehend the doing of deeds. The sovereignty is for Aûharmazd (that is, the sovereignty which is his, Aûharmazd has kept with advantage) who gives necessaries \[or comfort, or clothing\] to the poor (that is, they would make intercession for them).’
  Additional phrases are sometimes inserted, and some words altered, but the above is the usual form of this commentary.

[^14]: (159:1) Bund. I, 22.

[^15]: (159:2) Bund. I, 28.

[^16]: (160:1) This is the Av. zrvâna akarana, ‘boundless time or antiquity,’ of Vend. XIX, 33, 44. He is a personification of duration and age, and is here distinctly stated to be a creature of Aûharmazd. This throws some doubt upon the statements of Armenian writers, who assert that the two spirits sprang from Zrvâna.

[^17]: (160:2) Compare Bund. III, 11.
