## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXIX [^1].

1\. On \[the _spiritual_ chieftainship [^2] of the regions _of the earth_\] it says in revelation, that every one of those six chieftainships [^3] has one _spiritual_ chief; as the chief of Arzah is Ashâshagaha<i>d</i>\-ê <i>H</i><i>v</i>a<i>n</i>d<i>k</i>ãn [^4], the chief of Savah is Hoazarôdathhri-hanâ Parê<i>s</i>tyarô [^5], the chief of Frada<i>d</i>afsh is Spîtôî<i>d</i>\-i Aûspôsînân [^6], \[the chief of Vîda<i>d</i>afsh is Aîrî<i>z</i>\-râsp Aûspôsînân [^7],\] the chief of Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t is Huvâsp [^8], the chief of Vôrûgar<i>s</i>t is <i>K</i>akhravâk [^9]. 2. Zaratû<i>s</i>t is <span id="p116"><sup><small>[ p. 116 ]</small></sup></span> _spiritual_ chief of the region of Khvanîras, and also of all the regions; _he is_ chief of the world of the righteous, _and_ it is said that the whole religion was received by them from Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^1].

3\. In the region of Khvanîras are many places, from which, in this evil time of violent struggling with the adversary, a passage (vi<i>d</i>arg) is constructed by the power of the spiritual world (maînôkîh), _and one_ calls _them_ the beaten tracks [^2] of Khvanîras.

4\. Counterparts of those other regions [^3] are _such places_ as Kangde<i>z</i>, the land of S<i>a</i>ukavastân, the plain of the Arabs (Tâ<i>z</i>îkân), the plain of Pê<i>s</i>yânsaî, the river Nâîvtâk [^4], Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, the enclosure (var) formed by Yim, _and_ Ka<i>s</i>mîr in India [^5]. 5. And one immortal chief acts in the government of _each_ <span id="p117"><sup><small>[ p. 117 ]</small></sup></span> _of_ them; as it says, that Pêshyôtanû [^1] _son_ of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, whom they call <i>K</i>îtrô-maînô [^2], is in the country of Kangde<i>z</i> [^3]; Aghrêra<i>d</i> [^4] _son_ of Pashang is in the land of S<i>a</i>ukavastân [^5], and they call him Gôpatshah [^6]; Par<i>s</i>adgâ [^7] <i>H</i><i>v</i>embya is in the plain of <span id="p118"><sup><small>[ p. 118 ]</small></sup></span> Pêsyânsaî [^1], _and he_ is <i>H</i><i>v</i>embya for this reason, because they brought _him_ up in a <i>h</i><i>v</i>emb (‘jar’) for fear of Khashm (‘Wrath’); \[Asâm-i [^2] Yamâhu<i>s</i>t is in the place which they call the River Nâîvtâk\]; the tree opposed to harm [^3] is in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>; Urvatad-nar [^4] _son_ of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is in the enclosure formed by Yim. 6. Regarding them it says, they are _those_ who are immortal, as are Narsih [^5] _son_ of Vîvanghâû, Tûs [^6] _son_ of Nô<i>d</i>ar [^7], Gîw [^8] _son_ of Gû<i>d</i>ar<i>z</i>, Ibairaz [^9] the causer of strife, _and_ Ashavazd son of Pourudhâkh<i>s</i>t [^10]; and they will all [^11] come forth, to the <span id="p119"><sup><small>[ p. 119 ]</small></sup></span> assistance of Sôshyans, on the production of the renovation _of the universe_.

7\. Regarding Sâm [^1] it says, that he became immortal, _but_ owing to his disregard of the Mazdayasnian religion, a Tûrk whom they call Nihâ<i>g</i> [^2] wounded _him_ with an arrow, when he was asleep there, in the plain of Pê<i>s</i>yânsaî; and it had brought upon him the unnatural lethargy (bûshasp) _which_ overcame _him in_ the midst of the heat [^3]. 8. And the glory (far) of heaven stands over him [^4] for the purpose that, when A<i>z</i>\-i Dahâk [^5] becomes unfettered (ara<i>z</i>ak), he may arise and slay him; and a myriad guardian spirits of the righteous are as a protection to him. 9. Of Dahâk, whom they call Bêvarâsp, this, too, it says, that Frê<i>d</i>ûn when he captured Dahâk was not able to kill _him_, and afterwards confined him in Mount Dimâvand [^6]; when he becomes unfettered, Sâm arises, and smites and slays him.

10\. As to Kangde<i>z</i>, _it is_ in the direction of the east, at many leagues from the bed (var) [^7] of the <span id="p120"><sup><small>[ p. 120 ]</small></sup></span> wide-formed ocean towards that side. 11. The plain of Pê<i>s</i>yânsaî is in Kâvulistân, as it says, that the most remarkable upland (bâlist) in Kâvulistân is where Pê<i>s</i>yânsaî is; there it is hotter, on the more lofty elevations there is no heat [^1]. 12. Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> is in the direction of Âtarô-pâtakân [^2]. 13. The land of S<i>a</i>ukavastân is on the way from Tûrkistân to <i>K</i>înistân, in the direction of the north. 14. \[The enclosure\] [^3] formed by Yim is _in_ the middle of Pârs, in Sruvâ [^4]; thus, they say, that _what_ Yim formed (Yim-kar<i>d</i>) is below Mount Yimakân [^5]. 15. Ka<i>s</i>mîr is in Hindûstân.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (115:1) For this chapter, which is numbered XXX by previous translators, we have to depend only on K20 and TD (see the note on the heading of Chap. XXVIII); and the words enclosed in brackets are supplied from TD, being either illegible or omitted in K20.

[^2]: (115:2) Perhaps ‘patriarchate’ or ‘episcopate’ would be a better translation of ra<i>d</i>îh, and ‘patriarch’ or ‘bishop’ of ra<i>d</i>, in this chapter, as the chief high-priest (dastûr-i dastûrân) and his office are evidently meant by these words.

[^3]: (115:3) Of the six other regions, distinct from this one of Khvanîras, see Chap. XI, 2-4.

[^4]: (115:4) TD has Ashashâg,h<i>d</i>\-ê aîgh Nêva<i>n</i>dãn; both MSS. giving these names in a barbarous Pâzand form which cannot be relied on. Perhaps this Dastûr is the Av. Ashâvanghu Biva<i>n</i>dangha of Fravardîn Yt. 110.

[^5]: (115:5) TD has Hôazarôkakhhr-hanâ Parê<i>s</i>tyrô, all in Pâzand in both MSS., except Huz. hanâ, which stands for Pâz. ê, here used for the idhâfat i. Perhaps this Dastûr is the Av. <i>G</i>arô-danghu Pairi<i>s</i>tîra of Fravardîn Yt. 110.

[^6]: (115:6) So in TD; K20 has Pâz. Spaitanid-i Huspâsnyân. This Dastûr is, no doubt, the Av. (gen.) Spitôi<i>s</i> Uspãsnao<i>s</i> of Fravardîn Yt. 121.

[^7]: (115:7) Omitted in K20, but, no doubt, this Dastûr is the Av. Erezrâspa Uspãsnu of Fravardîn Yt. 121.

[^8]: (115:8) Av. Hvaspa of Fravardîn Yt. 122.

[^9]: (115:9) So in both MSS. As in the case of each of the preceding two pair of regions, two consecutive names of Dastûrs have been taken from the Fravardîn Ya<i>s</i>t, it may be supposed that the names p. 116 taken for this third pair of regions will also be consecutive, and this Dastûr must, therefore, be identified with the Av. <i>K</i>athwaraspa of Fravardîn Yt. 122.

[^1]: (116:1) TD has ‘Zaratû<i>s</i>t is chief of this region of Khvanîras, and also of the whole world of the righteous; all chieftainship, also, is from Zaratû<i>s</i>t, so that the whole religion,’ &c.

[^2]: (116:2) Justi has ‘zones, climates;’ but transcribing Pâz. habâvanhâ back into Pahlavi we have a word which may be read khabânŏhâ, pl. of khabân, ‘a trampling-place’ (comp. Pers. khabîdan). TD has khvabî<i>s</i>nŏ-gâs, which has the same meaning.

[^3]: (116:3) Meaning, probably, that they resemble the six smaller regions in being isolated and difficult of access; in other words, either mythical, or independent of Iranian rule.

[^4]: (116:4) So in TD, which also omits the second, third, and fourth of these isolated territories. In K20 we might read ra<i>d</i> va khû<i>d</i>âk, ‘chief and lord,’ as an epithet of Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>. This river must be the Nâhvtâk of Chap. XXI, 6.

[^5]: (116:5) Reading Ka<i>s</i>mîr-i andar Hindû, but TD has Ka<i>s</i>mîr-i andarûnŏ; perhaps the last word was originally anîrânak, in which case we should read ‘the not-Iranian Ka<i>s</i>mîr.’

[^1]: (117:1) The Av. Peshôtanu of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Yt. 4, where he is described as free from disease and death. TD has Pêshyôk-tanû. See also Chaps. XXXI, 29, XXXII, 5.

[^2]: (117:2) TD has <i>K</i>itrô-mâônô, and it may be doubted whether the latter portion of the name be derived from Av. mainyu, ‘spirit,’ or m<i>a</i>unghô, ‘moon.’ The Dâ<i>d</i>istân-i-Dînîk (Reply 89) calls him ‘Patshâyôtanû who is called from the <i>K</i>îtrôk-mâhanô (or mîyânô),’ the <i>K</i>atru-mîyân river of Chap. XX, 7, 31.

[^3]: (117:3) See § 10. TD has Kangde<i>z</i>\-i bâmîk, ‘Kangde<i>z</i> the splendid.’

[^4]: (117:4) The Av. Aghraêratha Narava of Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 18, 22, Fravardîn Yt. 131, Ashi Yt. 38, Zamyâd Yt. 77; he is Aghrîrath, brother of Afrâsiyâb, in the Shâhnâmah; see also Chap. XXXI, 15.

[^5]: (117:5) TD has Pahl. Sakîkstân here, but Sôkapastân in § 13 (the letters îk and p being often much alike in Pahlavi writing). K20 has Pâz. Sâvkavatân, S<i>a</i>ukâvasta, and Sâvkavastãn.

[^6]: (117:6) TD has Gôpat-malkâ, ‘king of Gôpat;’ and Dâ<i>d</i>. (Reply 89) states that ‘the reign of Gôpatshah is over the country of Gôpatô, coterminous with Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, on the bank of the water of the Dâîtîk; _and_ he keeps watch over the ox Hadhayãs, on whom occurred the various emigrations of men of old.’ Mkh. (LXII, 31-36) says, ‘Gôpatshâh remains in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, within the region of Khvanîras; from foot to mid-body _he is_ a bull, and from mid-body to top _he is_ a man; at all times he stays on the sea-shore, and always performs the worship of God, and always pours holy-water into the sea; through the pouring of that holy-water innumerable noxious creatures in the sea will die; for if he should not mostly perform that ceremonial, and should not pour that holy-water into the sea, and those innumerable noxious creatures should not perish, then always when rain falls the noxious creatures would fall like rain.’ In Chap. XXXI, 20, he is said to be a son of Aghrêra<i>d</i>.

[^7]: (117:7) So in K20; and Av. Parsha<i>d</i>g<i>a</i>u occurs in Fravardîn Yt. 96, 127; but TD has Fradakh<i>s</i>tar Khûmbîkân, and Dâ<i>d</i>. (Reply 89) mentions ‘Fradhakh<i>s</i>tô son of Khûmbîkân’ as one of the seven p. 118 immortal lords of Khvanîras, which name corresponds with the Av. Fradhâkh<i>s</i>ti Khu<i>n</i>bya of Fravardîn Yt. 138.

[^1]: (118:1) TD has always Pahl. Pê<i>s</i>ânsih. No doubt the Pi<i>s</i>în valley is meant (see § 11).

[^2]: (118:2) Or it may be read Aêshm-i. This phrase occurs only in TD, but Dâ<i>d</i>. (Reply 89) mentions ‘the Avesta Yakhmâyî<i>s</i>a<i>d</i>, son of the same Fryânô,’ as one of the seven immortal lords of Khvanîras.

[^3]: (118:3) See Chap. XXVII, 2.

[^4]: (118:4) See Chap. XXXII, 5.

[^5]: (118:5) Or Narsâe in TD; K20 has Paz. Narêî, but see Chap. XXXI, 3, 5.

[^6]: (118:6) Av. Tusa of Âbân Yt. 53, 58, and an Iranian warrior in the Shâhnâmah.

[^7]: (118:7) Av. Naotara, whose descendants are mentioned in Âbân Yt. 76, 98, Fravardîn Yt. 102, Râm Yt. 35.

[^8]: (118:8) Av. Gaêvani of Fravardîn Yt. 115 is something like this name of one of the Iranian warriors in the Shâhnâmah.

[^9]: (118:9) TD has Pâz. Bairazd. Perhaps it is not a name but a Pâzand corruption of Pahl. aêvarz, ‘warrior, trooper’ (traditionally); in which case we should have to read ‘the warrior who was a causer of strife.’

[^10]: (118:10) So in TD; K20 has ‘Ashavand son of Porudakh<i>s</i>t’ and Dâ<i>d</i>. (Reply 89) mentions ‘Ashavazang son of Pôrûdakhstôîh’ as one of the seven immortal lords of Khvanîras. He is the Av. ‘Ashavazdangh the Pourudhâkh<i>s</i>tiyan’ of Âbân Yt. 72, Fravardîn Yt. 112.

[^11]: (118:11) So in TD, but K20 has ‘always.’

[^1]: (119:1) This is not Sâm the grandfather of Rustam, but the Av. Sâma, who appears to have been an ancestor of Keresâspa (see Yas. IX, 30), called <i>S</i>am, grandfather of Gar<i>s</i>âsp, in a passage interpolated in some copies of the Shâhnâmah (compare Chap. XXXI, 26, 27). Here, however, it appears from the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t (III, 59, 60) that Keresâspa himself is meant, he being, called Sâma Keresâspa in Fravardîn Yt. 61, 136.

[^2]: (119:2) It can also be read Nihâ<i>v</i> or Nîyâ<i>g</i> in K20, and Nihâv or Nihân in TD.

[^3]: (119:3) TD has ‘_as_ he lay _in_ the midst of the heat.’

[^4]: (119:4) TD has ‘and the snow (vafar) has settled (nishast) over him.’

[^5]: (119:5) See Chaps. XXXI, 6, XXXIV, 5.

[^6]: (119:6) See Chap. XII, 31.

[^7]: (119:7) TD has a<i>g</i>var, ‘above,’ instead of min var, ‘from the bed.’

[^1]: (120:1) Or, ‘the hottest there, through the very lofty elevation, is not heat.’

[^2]: (120:2) Pers. Âdarbî<i>g</i>ân.

[^3]: (120:3) The word var is omitted in K20.

[^4]: (120:4) TD has Pahl. Srûbâk.

[^5]: (120:5) Or it may be read Damakân, but TD has <i>K</i>amakân. It can hardly be Dâmaghân, as that is a town and district in Khurâsân; Justi also suggests the district of <i>G</i>amagân in Pârs, and thinks Sruvâ means ‘cypress wood,’ there being a Salvastân between Shîrâz and Fasâ.
