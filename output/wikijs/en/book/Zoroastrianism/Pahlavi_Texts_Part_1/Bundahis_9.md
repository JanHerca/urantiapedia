## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER IX.

1\. The conflict waged with plants was that when [^5] they became quite dry. 2. Amerôda<i>d</i> the arch-angel, <span id="p31"><sup><small>[ p. 31 ]</small></sup></span> as the vegetation was his own, pounded the plants small, _and_ mixed _them_ up with the water _which_ Tî<i>s</i>tar seized, and Tî<i>s</i>tar made that water rain down upon the whole earth. 3. On the whole earth plants grew up like hair upon the heads of men. 4. Ten thousand [^1] of them grew forth of one special description, for keeping away the ten thousand species of disease _which_ the evil spirit produced for the creatures; _and_ from those ten thousand, the 100,000 species [^2] of plants have grown forth.

5\. From that same germ of plants the tree of all germs [^3] was given forth, _and_ grew up in the wide-formed ocean, from which the germs of all species of plants ever increased. 6. And near to that tree of all germs the Gôkar<i>d</i> tree [^4] was produced, for keeping away deformed (dûspa<i>d</i>) decrepitude; _and_ the full perfection of the world arose therefrom.
