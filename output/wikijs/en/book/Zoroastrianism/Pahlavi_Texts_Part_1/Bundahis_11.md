## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XI.

1\. On the nature of the earth it says in revelation, that _there_ are thirty and three kinds [^1] of land. 2. _On_ the day when Tî<i>s</i>tar produced the rain, when its seas arose therefrom, the whole place, half taken up by water, was converted into seven portions; this portion [^2], as much as one-half, is the middle, _and_ six portions are around; those six portions are _together_ as much as Khvanîras. 3. The name <span id="p33"><sup><small>[ p. 33 ]</small></sup></span> kêshvar (‘zone or region’) is also applied to them, and _they_ existed side by side (kash kash) [^3]; as on the east side of this portion (Khvanîras) is the Savah region, _on_ the west is the Arzah region; the two portions on the south side are the Frada<i>d</i>afsh _and_ Vîda<i>d</i>afsh regions, the two portions on the north side are the Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t _and_ Vôrû<i>g</i>ar<i>s</i>t regions, _and_ that in the middle is Khvanîras. 4. And Khvanîras has the sea, for one part of the wide-formed ocean wound about around it; _and from_ Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t _and_ Vôrû<i>g</i>ar<i>s</i>t a lofty mountain grew up; so that it is not possible for any one to go from region to region [^4].

5\. And of these seven regions every benefit was created most in Khvanîras, and the evil spirit also produced most for Khvanîras, on account of the superiority (sarîh) [^5] which he saw in it. 6. For the Kayânians and heroes were created in Khvanîras; and the good religion of the Mazdayasnians was created in Khvanîras, and afterwards conveyed to the other regions; Sôshyans [^6] is born in Khvanîras, who makes the evil spirit impotent, and causes the resurrection _and_ future existence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (32:3) K20b has ‘thirty-two kinds.’

[^2]: (32:4) That is, Khvanîras; or it may be ‘one portion,’ as hanâ, ‘this,’ is often used for aê, ‘one,’ because the Pâzand form of both words is <i>e</i>.

[^3]: (33:1) Possibly an attempt to connect the term kêshvar with kash; but the sentence may also be translated thus: ‘and _they_ formed various districts like this portion; on the east side is the Savah region,’ &c.

[^4]: (33:2) In the Pahlavi Vend. I, 4a, and in the Mainyô-i-khar<i>d</i>, IX, 6, it is added, ‘except with the permission of the angels’ or the demons.

[^5]: (33:3) So in M6; but K20 has za<i>d</i>ârîh, which would imply, ‘for the destruction of what he saw of it.’

[^6]: (33:4) Always spelt so in the Bundahi<i>s</i> MSS. K20 and M6, and corrupted into Sôshyôs in Pâzand; but it is more usually written Sôshâns in other Pahlavi works, and its Avesta form is Saoshyãs (see Chap. XXXII, 8).
