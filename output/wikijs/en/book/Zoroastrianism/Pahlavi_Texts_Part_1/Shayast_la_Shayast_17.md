## SHAYÂST LA-SHAYÂST. CHAPTER XVII.

1\. This, too, Zaratû<i>s</i>t asked of Aûharmazd, that is: ‘Which is the time when _one_ must not eat meat?’

2\. Aûharmazd gave a reply thus: ‘In a house when a person shall die, until three nights are completed, nothing whatever of meat is to be placed on a sacred cake (drôn) therein and in _its_ vicinity [^1]; but these, such as milk, cheese, fruit, eggs, and preserves, are to be placed; _and_ nothing whatever of meat is to be eaten _by_ his relations [^2]. 3. In all the three days it is necessary to perform the ceremonial (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n) of Srôsh for this _reason_, because Srôsh will be able to save his soul from the hands of the demons _for_ the three days [^3]; and when _one_ constantly <span id="p383"><sup><small>[ p. 383 ]</small></sup></span> performs a ceremonial _at_ every period (gâs) [^4] in the three days _it_ is _as_ good as though they should celebrate the whole religious ritual (hamâk dînô) at one time. 4. And after the third night, _at_ dawn, _one_ is to consecrate three sacred cakes (drôn), one _for_ Rashnû _and_ Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i>, the second _for_ Vâê the good [^5], _and_ the third _for_ the righteous guardian spirit (ar<i>d</i>âî fravar<i>d</i>); and clothing [^6] is to be placed upon the sacred cake of the righteous guardian spirit. 5. For the fourth day it is allowable to slaughter a sheep [^7], _and_ the fourth day the ceremonial (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n) of the righteous guardian spirit is to be performed; and afterwards are the tenth-day, the monthly, and, then, the annual _ceremonies_; and the first monthly is exactly on the thirtieth day, and the annual on the particular day [^8]. 6. When he <span id="p384"><sup><small>[ p. 384 ]</small></sup></span> shall die _at_ a place distant _from that_ where the information arrives, when the three _days’ ceremonies_ (satûîh) are celebrated _at_ that place where he shall die _it_ is well, when not, their celebration is _to be at_ this place, _and_ from the _time_ when the information arrives, until three nights are completed, it is necessary to perform the ceremonial of Srôsh, _and_ after three days and nights it is necessary to perform the ceremonial of the righteous guardian spirit.’

7\. _In_ one place _it_ is declared, that of him whose begetting is owing to the demons, of him who commits sodomy, and of him who performs the religious rites (dînô) of apostasy, of none of the three do <span id="p385"><sup><small>[ p. 385 ]</small></sup></span> they restore the dead [^9], for this _reason_, because he whose begetting is owing to the demons is himself a demon [^10], and the soul of him who commits sodomy will become a demon [^11], and the soul of him _who_ performs the religious rites of apostasy will become a darting snake [^12].

8\. This, too, is revealed by the Avesta [^13], that Aûharmazd spoke thus: ‘Give ye up the persons of all men, with the submissiveness of worshippers, _to_ that man to whom the whole Avesta and Zand is easy [^14], so that he may make you acquainted with duties and good works; because men go to hell for this _reason_, when they do not submit _their_ persons to priestly control (aêrpatistân), and do not become acquainted with duties and good works.’

9\. Query:—There is an action which, according to the Avesta [^15], is not good for a person to do, _and_ the sentence of ‘worthy of death’ is set upon _it_; for _one's_ better preservation is _one_ not to do that action, <span id="p386"><sup><small>[ p. 386 ]</small></sup></span> or to accomplish _and_ urge _it_ on, for the advance of religion in a state of uncertainty (var-hômandîh)? 10. The answer is this, that when they act well for _their_ better preservation _there_ is no fear, on account of acting well, but _one_ is not to forsake that [^16], too, though _it_ be not goodness; a forsaken duty is very bad, for a contempt of it enters into one.

11\. This, too, is declared, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûharmazd thus: ‘From what place do these people rise again? from that place where they first went into _their_ mothers, or from that place where the mothers have given _them_ birth, or from that place where _their_ bodies happen _to be_ (aûftê<i>d</i>)?’ 12. Aûharmazd gave a reply thus: ‘Not from that place where they have gone into _their_ mothers, nor from that place where they have been born from _their_ mothers, nor from that place where _their_ bodies and flesh happen _to be_, for they rise from that place where the life went out from their bodies.’ 13. And this, too, he asked, that is: ‘Whence do they raise [^17] _him_ again who is suspended from anything, _and_ shall die in the air?’ 14. The reply _was:_ ‘From that place where his bones and flesh first fall to the ground; hence, except when he shall die on a divan (gâs) or a bed (vistarg), before they carry him away, whatever _it_ <span id="p387"><sup><small>[ p. 387 ]</small></sup></span> _is_, a fragment [^18] is to be taken and to be laid across his limbs; for when the usage is not so, they raise him again from that place where his body arrives at the ground.’

15\. Completed in peace, pleasure, _and_ joy [^19].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (382:1) Reading va hamgôshak, the latter word being apparently used in a parallel passage in Pahl. Vend. VIII, 64 in old MSS.; this reading is, however, somewhat doubtful here, and perhaps we ought to read ‘on a sacred cake in that roofed place (pavan zak vâmkînîh);’ the last word being a possible term for ‘roofing’ as it stands, though it may be a miswriting of vâmpô<i>s</i> (Pers. bâmpô<i>s</i>, ‘roofing’).

[^2]: (382:2) The Parsis, nowadays (Dastûr Hoshangji says), do not cook for three days under a roof where a death has occurred, but obtain food from their neighbours and friends; but if the cookroom he under a separate roof, as often happens in India, they have no objection to cooking there.

[^3]: (382:3) The soul is supposed to hover about the body for the first three nights after death, during which time it has to rely upon the angel Srôsh (see Bund. XXX, 29) for protection from the demons, which the angel, it is presumed, will afford more efficiently if properly propitiated by the surviving relatives. At the third dawn after death (that is, the dawn of the fourth day inclusive of the day of death) the soul is supposed to depart finally for the other world (see AV. IV, 8-36, XVII, 5-27).

[^4]: (383:1) These periods of the day are five in summer, and four in winter (see Bund. XXV, 9, 10).

[^5]: (383:2) The usual name of the angel Râm (the Vayu of Râm Yt.) who, with the angels Rashnû and Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i>, is supposed to be stationed at the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, where the soul has to give an account of its actions during life shortly after the dawn following the third night after death (see AV. V. 3, CI, 21, note, Mkh. II, 115).

[^6]: (383:3) This clothing must be new and good, and is supposed to be supplied to the spirit to prevent its appearing unclothed in the other world, where the clothing of the soul is said to be formed ‘out of almsgivings’ (Chap. XII, 4); to fulfil which condition the clothes provided are presented to the officiating priests (see Saddar Bundahi<i>s</i> LXXXVII).

[^7]: (383:4) Or ‘goat.’

[^8]: (383:5) That is, on the exact anniversary of the death; the sentence is rather obscure, but this appears to be the meaning. With regard to the ceremonies after a death, the Persian Rivâyats give more details, which may be summarized as follows:—On each of the first three days a Srôsh Ya<i>s</i>t is performed and a Srôsh Drôn consecrated (see Chap. III, 32, note). On the third night, in the middle of the Aiwisrûthrem Gâh (dusk to midnight), a renunciation p. 384 of sin is performed in the house of the deceased; and in the Ushahin Gâh (midnight to dawn) four Drôns are consecrated, one dedicated to the good Vâê (Nâ-î veh), one to Rashn and Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i>, one to Srôsh, and one to the righteous (ashôân), and in front of the last are placed new and clean clothes with fruit, but without an egg. On the fourth day, at sunrise, the Dahmân Âfrîngân (Yas. LIX) is recited, and then the Khûrshê<i>d</i> and Mihir Nyâyi<i>s</i>, after which the people in the house can first eat fresh-cooked meat. During the fourth day also the Ya<i>s</i>t of the righteous is performed, and the Drôn of the righteous is consecrated; and the same again on the tenth day, together with the recitation of the Dahmân Âfrîngân. On the thirtieth day the Sîrôzah (praise of the thirty days) is to be celebrated, with the dedication to the thirty days; thirty-three beans (lûvak) and thirty-three eggs, with fruit, being placed in front of the Drôn, which is consecrated in the presence of fire; and, afterwards, the assistant priest consecrates a Drôn for Srôsh. The next day the chief priest consecrates a Drôn for the righteous; a suit of clothes and fruit being placed in front of the Drôn. And each day a Ya<i>s</i>t of the righteous is performed, a Drôn of the righteous is consecrated, and an Âfrîngân recited. On the same day every month the same Ya<i>s</i>t, Drôn, and, Âfrîngân are celebrated; a priest also undergoes the Bareshnûm for the deceased, a Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i> (see Bund. XXX, 28) is performed, and three Vendidads dedicated to Srôsh. On each day at the end of a year the Sîrôzah Ya<i>s</i>t is performed, and a Drôn p. 385 dedicated to the thirty days is consecrated, thirty-three beans being placed, with one Drôn, one Frasast (see Chap. III, 32, note), one pentagonal Drôn as the sun, one crescent-shaped as the moon, thirty-three eggs, and fruit, in front of the Drôn, which is consecrated in the presence of fire; afterwards, the assistant priest consecrates a Drôn for Srôsh, and recites the Dahmân Âfrîngân, and the next day the chief priest consecrates a Drôn for the righteous, a suit of clothes being placed before the Drôn, and recites the Dahmân Âfrîngân.

[^9]: (385:1) That is, there is no resurrection for them.

[^10]: (385:2) And, therefore, not immortal according to the Parsi faith.

[^11]: (385:3) Compare Vend. VIII, 98-106.

[^12]: (385:4) Which being a creature of the evil spirit is doomed to destruction.

[^13]: (385:5) But it is doubtful if the passage be extant.

[^14]: (385:6) That is, the man who knows the whole scripture and commentary by heart.

[^15]: (385:7) Reading pavan Avistâk, instead of Avistâk pavan.

[^16]: (386:1) The religion in a position of difficulty appears to be the meaning, but the reply to this question of casuistry is by no means clear.

[^17]: (386:2) Literally, ‘they rise,’ both here and in the next section, but the change to the plural number is perplexing, unless it refers to those who prepare the resurrection of the dead (Bund. XXX, 4, 7, 17), as here assumed by reading ‘they raise.’

[^18]: (387:1) Apparently a fragment of the place whereon the death took place is meant by ka<i>d</i>âm-1 pârak.

[^19]: (387:2) The miscellaneous passages which follow Sls. in M6 terminate at this point, which is the end of the first volume of that MS. The next three chapters are taken from the latter end of the other volume of M6.
