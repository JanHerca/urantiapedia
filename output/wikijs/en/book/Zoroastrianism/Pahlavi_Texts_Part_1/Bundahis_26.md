## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. A Hâsar [^1] on the ground is a Parasang of one thousand steps of the two feet. 2. A Parasang [^2] is a measure as much as a far-seeing man may look out, see a beast _of burden, and_ make known that _it_ is black or white. 3. And the measure of a man is eight medium spans [^3].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (98:1) Av. hâthra of Vend. II, 65, VIII, 280, 287, 291, Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 23, 29. The statements regarding the length of a Hâsar are rather perplexing, for we are told that it ‘is like a Parasang’ (Chap. XIV, 4), that ‘the length of a Hâsar is one-fourth of a Parasang’ (Chap. XVI, 7), and that ‘a medium Hâsar on the ground, which they also call a Parasang, is a thousand steps of the two feet when walking with propriety’ (Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk, ed. Hosh. p. 42). To reconcile these statements we must conclude that the Hâsar is like a Parasang merely in the sense of being a long measure of distance, that it is really the mille passus or mile of the Romans, and that it is a quarter of the actual Parasang. At the same time, as it was usual to call a Hâsar by the name of a Parasang, we are often left in doubt whether a mile or a league is meant, when a Hâsar or Parasang is mentioned. The Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk (p. 41) also mentions other measures of distance, such as the ta<i>k</i>ar (Av. ta<i>k</i>ara) of two Hâsars, the asvâst (or aêast) of four Hâsars, the dashmêst (Av. dakhshmaiti) of eight, Hâsars, and the yô<i>g</i>êst (Av. yi<i>g</i>aiasti or yu<i>g</i>aiasti) of sixteen Hâsars.

[^2]: (98:2) A Parasang is usually from 3½ to 4 English miles, but perhaps a Hâsar is meant here.

[^3]: (98:3) Reading vitast-i miyânak instead of vitast damânak. The Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk (p. 41) mentions three kinds of spans, the Av. vitasti (Vend. VIII, 243, 245, XVII, 13) of twelve finger-breadths (angûst), or about 9 inches, which is a full span between the thumb and little finger (the one mentioned in the text); the Av. di<i>s</i>ti (Vend. XVII, 13) of ten finger-breadths, or about 7½ inches, which is a span between the thumb and middle finger; and the p. 99 Av. uza<i>s</i>ti (Pahl. lâlâ-a<i>s</i>t) of eight finger-breaths, or about 6 inches which is a span between the thumb and fore-finger. Other measures mentioned by the same authority are the pâî (Av. padha, Vend. IX, 15, 20, 29), ‘foot,’ of fourteen finger-breadths, or about 10½ inches; the gâm (Av. gâya, Vend. III, 57, &c.), ‘step,’ which ‘in the Vendîdâd is three pâî,’ or about 2 feet 7½ inches, ‘and in other places is said _to be_ two frârâst’ (Av. frârâthni in Vend. VII, 76, 79, 87); so the frârâst, which is probably the distance from the neck to the extended elbow, is half a gâm, or from 15 to 16 inches. Two other measures are mentioned in Vend. VII, 7 9, 87, 90, IX, 8, the Av. frâbâzu, ‘fore-arm or cubit’ from elbow to finger-ends, which is about 18 inches (or it may be a half fathom); and Av. vîbâzu, which is probably the ‘fathom,’ or extent of the two arms out-stretched, from 5½ to 6 feet.
