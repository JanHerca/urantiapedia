## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXV.

1\. On matters of religion [^1] it says in revelation thus: ‘The creatures of the world were created by me complete in three hundred and sixty-five days,’ that is, the six periods of the Gâhanbârs which are completed in a year. 2. It is always necessary first to count the day _and_ afterwards the night, for first the day goes off, _and_ then the night comes on [^2]. And from the season (gâs) of Mê<i>d</i>ôk-shêm [^3], <span id="p92"><sup><small>[ p. 92 ]</small></sup></span> which is the auspicious [^4] day Khûr of the month Tîr [^5], to the season of Mê<i>d</i>îyârêm [^6], which is the <span id="p93"><sup><small>[ p. 93 ]</small></sup></span> auspicious day Vâhrâm of the month Dîn [^7]—the short_est_ day—the night increases; and from the season of Mê<i>d</i>îyârêm to the season of Mê<i>d</i>ôk-shêm the night decreases _and_ the day increases. 4. The summer day is as much as two of the shortest [^8] winter days, _and_ the winter night is as much as two of the shortest summer nights [^9]. 5. The summer day is twelve Hâsars, the night six Hâsars; the winter night is twelve Hâsars, the day six; a Hâsar _being_ a _measure of_ time _and_, in like manner, of land [^10]. 6. In the season of Hamêspamadâyêm [^11], that is, the <span id="p94"><sup><small>[ p. 94 ]</small></sup></span> five _supplementary_ days at the end of the month Spendarma<i>d</i>, the day _and_ night are again equal.

7\. As from the auspicious day Aûharmazd of the month Fravar<i>d</i>în to the auspicious day Anîrân of the month Mitrô [^12] is the summer of seven months, _so_ from the auspicious day Aûharmazd of the month Âvân to the auspicious month Spendarma<i>d</i>, on to the end of the five _supplementary_ days [^13], is winter of five months. 8. The priest fulfils the regulation (va<i>k</i>ar) about a corpse _and_ other things, by this calculation as to summer and winter. 9. In those seven months [^14] of summer the periods (gâs) of the days and nights are five—since _one_ celebrates the Rapîtvîn—namely, the period of daybreak is Hâvan, the period of midday is Rapîtvîn, the period of afternoon is Aûzêrîn, when the appearance of the stars _has_ come into the sky [^15] until midnight is the period of Aîbisrûtêm, from midnight until the stars become imperceptible is the period of Aûshahîn [^16]. 10. In winter are four periods, for _from_ daybreak till Aûshahîn is all Hâvan, _and_ the rest as I _have_ said; and the reason of it is this, that the appearance [^17] of winter is in the direction of the <span id="p95"><sup><small>[ p. 95 ]</small></sup></span> north, where the regions Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t [^18] and Vôrû<i>g</i>ar<i>s</i>t are; the original dwelling of summer, too, is in the south, where the regions Frada<i>d</i>afsh _and_ Vîda<i>d</i>afsh are; on the day Aûharmazd of the auspicious month Âvân the winter acquires strength _and_ enters into the world, _and_ the spirit of Rapîtvîn goes from above-ground to below-ground, where the spring (khânî) of waters is, and diffuses [^19] warmth and moisture in the water, _and_ so many roots of trees do not wither with cold and drought. 11. And _on_ the auspicious day Âtarô of the month Dîn [^20] the winter arrives, with much cold, at Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>; _and_ until the end, in the auspicious month Spendarma<i>d</i>, winter advances through the whole world; on this account they kindle a fire everywhere _on_ the day Âtarô of the month Dîn, _and_ it forms an indication that winter _has_ come. 12. In those five months the water of springs _and_ conduits is all warm [^21], for Rapîtvîn keeps warmth _and_ moisture there, _and one_ does not celebrate the period of Rapîtvîn. 13. As the day Aûharmazd of the month Fravar<i>d</i>în advances it diminishes the strength which winter possesses, _and_ summer comes in from its own original dwelling, _and_ receives strength and dominion. 14. Rapîtvîn comes up from below-ground, _and_ ripens the fruit of the trees; on this account <span id="p96"><sup><small>[ p. 96 ]</small></sup></span> the water of springs is cold in summer [^22], for Rapîtvîn is not there; _and_ those seven [^23] months _one_ celebrates the Rapîtvîn, _and_ summer advances through the whole earth. 15. And yet in the direction of Hindûstân, there _where_ the original dwelling of summer is nearer, it is always neither cold nor hot; for in the season which is the dominion of summer, the rain always dispels most of the heat, _and_ it does not become perceptible; in the winter rain does not fall, _and_ the cold does not become very perceptible [^24]. 16. In the northern direction, where the preparation of winter is, _it is_ always cold [^25]; for in the summer mostly, on account of the more oppressive winter there, it is not possible so to dispel the cold that one might make _it_ quite warm. 17. In the middle localities the cold of winter _and_ heat of summer _both_ come on vehemently.

18\. Again, the year _dependent_ on the revolving moon is not equal to the computed year on this account, for the moon [^26] returns one time in twenty-nine, _and_ one time in thirty _days_, and there are four <span id="p97"><sup><small>[ p. 97 ]</small></sup></span> hours (zamân) more than such a one of its _years_ [^27]; as it says, that every one deceives where they speak about the moon (or month), except when they say that it _comes_ twice in sixty days. 19. Whoever keeps the year by the revolution of the moon mingles summer with winter _and_ winter with summer [^28].

20\. This, _too, it says_, that the auspicious month Fravar<i>d</i>în, the month Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t, _and_ the month Horvada<i>d</i> [^29] are spring; the month Tîr, the month Amerôda<i>d</i>, _and_ the month Shatvaîrô are summer; the month Mitrô, the month Âvân, _and_ the month Âtarô are autumn; the month Dîn, the month Vohûman, _and_ the month Spendarma<i>d</i> are winter [^30]. 21. And the sun comes from the sign (khûr<i>d</i>ak) of Aries, into which it proceeded in the beginning, back to that _same_ place in three hundred and sixty-five days and six short times (hours), which are one year. 22. As every three months it (the sun) advances through three constellations, more or less, the moon comes, in a hundred and eighty days, back to the place out of which it travelled in the beginning [^31].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (91:3) That is, ‘on the _periods for_ observance of religious duties.’

[^2]: (91:4) The Jewish and Muhammadan practice is just the contrary.

[^3]: (91:5) The Av. maidhyô-shema of Yas. I, 27, II, 36, III, 41, Visp. I, 3, II, 1, Âfrîngân Gâhanbâr 2, 8. It is the second season-festival, held on the five days, ending with the 105th day of the Parsi year, which formerly corresponded approximately to midsummer, according to the Bundahi<i>s</i>. Later writings assert that it commemorates the creation of water.

[^4]: (92:1) A dispute as to the meaning of this word formed no small part of the Kabîsah controversy, carried on between the leaders of the two rival sects of Parsis in Bombay about fifty years ago. Dastur Edalji Dârâbji, the high-priest of the predominant sect (who adhered to the traditional calendar of the Indian Parsis), insisted that it meant ‘solar,’ or ‘belonging to the calendar rectified for solar time by the intercalation of a month every 120 years;’ Mullâ Firûz, the high-priest of the new sect (who had adopted the calendar of the Persian Parsis, which is one month in advance of the other), asserted that the word had no connection with intercalation, but meant ‘commencing,’ or ‘pertaining to New-year’s day,‘ as translated into Sanskrit, by Nêryôsang, in Mkh. XLIX, 27. Anquetil translates it either as ’inclusive‘ or ’complete;‘ Windischmann simply skips it over; and Justi translates it everywhere as ’inclusive.‘ Dastur Edalji reads the word vehî<i>g</i>akî or vehî<i>g</i>ak; Nêryôsang has vah<i>e</i><i>z</i>a, Mullâ Firûz reads nâî<i>k</i>akîk in the Bundahi<i>s</i>, but vêhî<i>g</i>akîk in the Dînkar<i>d</i>, where the word also occurs; Justi has nâî<i>k</i>akîk. The meaning ’inclusive‘ suits the context in nearly all cases in the Bundahi<i>s</i>, but not elsewhere; if it had that meaning the most probable reading would be vikhê<i>g</i>akîk or nikhê<i>g</i>akîk, ’arising, leaping over, including.‘ It is nearly always used in connection with dates or periods of time, and must be some epithet of a very general character, not only applicable to intercalary periods, but also to New-Year’s day and dates in general; something like the Arabic epithet mubârak, ‘fortunate,’ so commonly used in Persian dates. Dastur Edalji compares it with Pers. bîhrak or bihtarak, ‘intercalary month,’ which is probably a corruption of it; and this suggests veh, ‘good,’ as one component of the epithet. The word may be read veh-ya<i>z</i>akîk, ‘for reverencing the good,’ but as veh, ‘good,’ is an adjective, this would be an irregular form; a more probable reading is veh-î<i>k</i>akîk, ‘for anything good,’ which, when applied to a day, or any period of time, would imply that it is suitable for anything good, that is, it is ‘auspicious.’ Sometimes the word is written vehî<i>k</i>ak, vêhî<i>k</i>akîk, or vêhî<i>k</i>ŏ; and epithets of similar forms in Pahlavi are applied by the writers of colophons to themselves, but these should be read vakhê<i>z</i>ak or ni<i>s</i>îvak, ‘lowly, abject.’

[^5]: (92:2) The eleventh day of the fourth month, when the festival commences.

[^6]: (92:3) The Av. maidhyâirya of Yas. I, 30, II, 39, III, 44, Visp. I, p. 93 6, II, 1, Âf. Gâhan. 2, 11. It is; the fifth season-festival, held on the five days ending with the 290th day of the Parsi year, which formerly corresponded approximately to midwinter, according to the Bundahi<i>s</i>. Later writings assert that it commemorates the creation of animals.

[^7]: (93:1) The twentieth day of the tenth month, when the festival ends.

[^8]: (93:2) The word kah-aît is merely a hybrid Huzvâri<i>s</i> form of kahist, ‘shortest,’ which occurs in the next phrase.

[^9]: (93:3) This statement must be considered merely as an approximation. The longest day is twice the length of the shortest one in latitude 49°, that is, north of Paris, Vienna, and Odessa, if the length of the day be computed from sunrise to sunset; and, if twilight be included, it is necessary to go still further north. In Âdarbî<i>g</i>ân, the northern province of Persia, the longest day is about 14½ hours from sunrise to sunset, and the shortest is about 9½ hours.

[^10]: (93:4) According to this passage a hâsar of time is one hour and twenty minutes; it is the Av. hâthra of the Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk (P. 43, ed. Hoshangji), which says, ‘of twelve Hâsars is the longest day, _and_ the day _and_ night in which is the longest day are twelve of the longest Hâsars, eighteen of the medium, and twenty-four of the least—an enumeration of the several measures of the Hâsar.’ For the hâsar measure of land, see Chap. XXVI.

[^11]: (93:5) So in K20, but this name is rarely written twice alike; it is the Av. hamaspathmaêdaya of Yas. I, 31, II, 40, III, 45, Visp, I. 7, II, 1, Âf. Gâhan. 2, 12. It is the sixth season-festival, held on the five Gâtha days which conclude the Parsi year, just before p. 94 the vernal equinox, according to the Bundahi<i>s</i>. Later writings assert that it commemorates the creation of man.

[^12]: (94:1) That is, from the first day of the first month to the last day of the seventh month.

[^13]: (94:2) That is, from the first day of the eighth month to the last of the five Gâtha days, which are added to the twelfth month to complete the year of 365 days.

[^14]: (94:3) All MSS. have ‘five months’ here.

[^15]: (94:4) K20 has ‘when the stars _have_ come into sight.’

[^16]: (94:5) The Avesta names of the five Gâhs are Hâvani, Rapithwina, Uzayêirina, Aiwisrûthrema, and Ushahina.

[^17]: (94:6) Pâz. ashâri<i>s</i> is evidently a misreading of Pahl. âshkârîh.

[^18]: (95:1) See Chaps. V, 8, XI, 3. The north, being opposed to the south or midday quarter, is opposed to the midday period of Rapîtvîn, which, therefore, disappears as winter approaches from the north.

[^19]: (95:2) If, instead of khânî for khânîk, ‘spring,’ we read ahû-i, ‘lord of,’ the translation will be, ‘so that the angel of waters may diffuse,’ &c.

[^20]: (95:3) The ninth day of the tenth month.

[^21]: (95:4) That is, warmer than the air, as it is cooler in summer.

[^22]: (96:1) K20 has ‘winter’ by mistake.

[^23]: (96:2) K20 has ‘six,’ and M6 ‘five,’ instead of ‘seven.’

[^24]: (96:3) This is a fairly accurate account of the effect of the monsoons over the greater part of India, as understood by a foreigner unacquainted with the different state of matters in a large portion of the Madras provinces.

[^25]: (96:4) M6 has khûrâsân instead of ârâyi<i>s</i>n, ‘preparation,’ which alters the sense into ‘that is, Khûrâsân, of which the winter is always cold.’

[^26]: (96:5) The MSS. have the Huzvâri<i>s</i> term for ‘month,’ which is sometimes used, by mistake, for ‘moon.’ It is doubtful which word the author intended to use here, but it is usual to count the days of a lunar month from the first actual appearance of the new moon, which usually occurs a full day after the change of the moon.

[^27]: (97:1) Meaning, probably, that the lunar year is four hours more than twelve months of 29 and 30 days each, alternately. It should be 8 hours, 48 minutes, and 37 seconds. The sentence seems defective, but it is evident from § 21 that zamân means ‘hour.’

[^28]: (97:2) That is, the lunar year being eleven days shorter than the solar one, its months are constantly retrograding through the seasons.

[^29]: (97:3) Generally written Avardâ<i>d</i> in Pâzand, and Khurdâd in Persian.

[^30]: (97:4) The names of the months are selected from the names of the days of the month (see Chap. XXVII, 24), but are arranged in a totally different order.

[^31]: (97:5) Probably meaning, that the new moon next the autumnal p. 98 equinox is to be looked for in the same quarter as the new moon nearest the vernal equinox, the moon's declination being nearly the same in both cases.
