## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. XXXIII [^1].

0\. The family of the Môbads (‘priests’).

1\. Bahak [^2] _was_ son of Hûbakht, _son_ of Âtarô-bôndak, _son_ of Mâhda<i>d</i>, _son_ of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, _son_ of Frâh-vakhsh-vindâ<i>d</i> [^3], _son_ of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, _son_ of Kâ<i>d</i> [^4], _son_ of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, _son_ of Ârâstih, _son_ of Paîtirâsp [^5]. 2. As Bahak was Môbad of Môbads (high-priest) unto Shâhpûhar [^6], son of Aûharmazd, _so_ Kâ<i>d</i> was the great preceptor (farmâ<i>d</i>âr) unto Dârâî [^7].

3\. Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> [^8] _was son_ of Mâraspend, son of Dâ<i>d</i>ar<i>d</i>â, _son_ of Dâ<i>d</i>îrâ<i>d</i>, _son_ of Hûdînô, _son_ of Âtarôdâ<i>d</i>, _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, _son_ of Vohûman-<i>k</i>îhar, _son_ of Fryânô [^9], _son_ of Bâhak [^10], _son_ of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, _son_ of <span id="p146"><sup><small>[ p. 146 ]</small></sup></span> Frashâîtar [^11], _son_ of Pôrûshasp, _son_ of Vînâsp, _son_ of Nivar, _son_ of Vakhsh, _son_ of Vahidhrôs, _son_ of Fra<i>s</i>t, _son_ of Gâk [^12], _son_ of Vakhsh, _son_ of Fryân, _son_ of Ra<i>g</i>an, _son_ of Dûrâsrôb, _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^13].

4\. Mitrô-varâ<i>z</i> _was son_ of Nîgâs-afzû<i>d</i>\-dâk, _son_ of Shîrtashôsp, _son_ of Par<i>s</i>tva, _son_ of Urva<i>d</i>\-gâ, _son_ of Tâham, _son_ of Zarîr, _son_ of Dûrâsrôb, _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i> [^14]. 5. Dûrnâmîk _was son_ of Zâgh, _son_ of Ma<i>s</i>vâk, _son_ of Nô<i>d</i>ar [^15], _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar.

6\. Mitrô-akâvî<i>d</i> _is son_ of Mar<i>d</i>ân-vêh [^16], _son_ of Afrôbag-vindâ<i>d</i>, _son_ of Vindâ<i>d</i>\-i-pê<i>d</i>âk, _son_ of Vâê-bûkht [^17], _son_ of Bahak, _son_ of Vâê-bûkht. 7. The mother from whom I was born is Hûmâî, daughter of Freh-mâh, who also _was_ the righteous daughters [^18] <span id="p147"><sup><small>[ p. 147 ]</small></sup></span> of Mâh-ayâr _son_ of Mâh-bôndak, _son_ of Mâh-bûkht. 8. Pûyi<i>s</i>n-shâ<i>d</i> _is son_ of Mar<i>d</i>ân-vêh, _son_ of Afrôbag-vindâ<i>d</i>, _son_ of Vindâ<i>d</i>\-i-pê<i>d</i>âk, _son_ of Vâê-bûkht, _son_ of Bahak, _son_ of Vâê-bûkht.

9\. All the other Môbads who have been renowned in the empire (khû<i>d</i>âyîh) _were_ from the same family it is said, _and_ were of this race of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^19]. 10. Those Môbads, likewise, who now exist are all from the same family they assert, and I, too, they boast, whom they call [^20] ‘the administration of perfect rectitude’ (Dâ<i>d</i>akîh-i Ashôvahi<i>s</i>tô) [^21]. 11. Yûdân-Yim _son_ of Vâhrâm-shâ<i>d</i>, _son_ of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> _son_ of Mâraspend, _son_ of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparham [^22], <span id="p148"><sup><small>[ p. 148 ]</small></sup></span> Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparham _son_ of Yûdân-Yim [^23], Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> son of Hâmî<i>d</i> [^24], Ashôvahi<i>s</i>t _son_ of Freh-Srôsh, _and_ the other Môbads have sprung from the same family.

12\. This, too, it says, that ‘in one winter I _will_ locate (<i>g</i>âkînam) the religion of the Mazdayasnians, _which_ came out into the other six regions.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (145:1) This chapter is found only in TD, where it forms a continuation of the preceding, and affords a means (see §§ 10, 11) for determining the age of the recension of the text contained in that MS. As nearly all the names are written, in Pahlavi letters, the pronunciation of many of them is merely a matter of guess.

[^2]: (145:2) Here written Bôhak, but it is Bahak or Bâk in § 2; compare Bâhak in § 3, and Av. B<i>a</i>ungha of Fravardîn Yt. 124.

[^3]: (145:3) Compare Av. Frashâvakhsha of Fravardîn Yt. 109.

[^4]: (145:4) Compare Av. Kâta of Fravardîn Yt. 124.

[^5]: (145:5) See Chap. XXXII, 2, for the last three generations; TD has Pîrtarâsp here, like the variant of M6 in Chap. XXXII, 1.

[^6]: (145:6) The Sasanian king Shâpûr II, who reigned A.D. 309-379.

[^7]: (145:7) According to the chronology of the Bundahi<i>s</i> (Chap. XXXIV, 8, 9), Dârâî lived only some four centuries before Shâpûr II, for which period only seven generations of priests are here provided. This period, moreover, is certainly about three centuries less than the truth.

[^8]: (145:8) This priest was prime minister of Shâpûr II.

[^9]: (145:9) Compare Av. Fryâna of Yas. XLV, 12.

[^10]: (145:10) This name is repeated in TD, probably by mistake (compare Bahak in §§ 1, 2).

[^11]: (146:1) This is probably a semi-Huzvâri<i>s</i> form of Frashô<i>s</i>tar.

[^12]: (146:2) Perhaps this name should be read along with the next one, so as to give the single Pâzand name <i>S</i>kina<i>s</i> or <i>S</i>kiva<i>s</i>.

[^13]: (146:3) See Chap. XXXII, 1, for the last three generations. According to this genealogy Âtarôpâ<i>d</i>\-i Mâraspendân was the twenty-third in descent from Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, whereas his contemporary, Bahak (§ 1), was twenty-second in descent from the same.

[^14]: (146:4) No doubt Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar is meant; if not, we must read Mânû<i>s</i>\-dûrnâmîk in connection with § 5.

[^15]: (146:5) Here written Nî<i>d</i>ar, but see Chaps. XXIX, 6, XXXI, 13.

[^16]: (146:6) Here written Mar<i>d</i>\-vêh, but see § 8.

[^17]: (146:7) Here written Aê-vûkht, but see § 8; it may be Vîs-bûkht, or Vê<i>s</i>\-bûkht.

[^18]: (146:8) The text is amî<i>d</i>ar mûna<i>s</i> li a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i> zerkhûn<i>d</i> Hûmôî dûkht-i Freh-mâh-i<i>k</i> aharôb vûkht (dûkht?). We might perhaps read ‘Freh-mâh _son_ of <i>K</i>ahârôb-bûkht,’ but it seems more probable that §§ 7, 8 should be connected, and that the meaning intended is that Hûmâî was daughter of Freh-mâh (of a certain family) and of Pûyi<i>s</i>n-shâ<i>d</i> (of another family); she was also the mother of the editor of that recension of the Bundahi<i>s</i> which is contained in TD; but who was his father? The singularly unnecessary repetition of the genealogy of the two brothers, Mitrô-akâvî<i>d</i> and Pûyi<i>s</i>n-shâ<i>d</i>, in §§ 6, 8, leads to the suspicion that if the latter p. 147 were his mother's father, the former was probably his own father or grandfather. Unfortunately the text makes no clear statement on the subject, and § 10 affords further material for guessing otherwise at his name and connections.

[^19]: (147:1) Compare Chap. XXXII, 4.

[^20]: (147:2) Reading va lî<i>k</i> laband-i karîtûnd.

[^21]: (147:3) This looks more like a complimentary title than a name, and if the editor of the TD recension of the Bundahi<i>s</i> were the son or grandson of Mitrô-akâvî<i>d</i> (§ 6) we have no means of ascertaining his name; but if he were not descended from Mitrô-akâvî<i>d</i> it is possible that §§ 10, 11 should be read together, and that he was the son of Yûdân-Yim. Now we know, from the heading and colophon of the ninety-two questions and answers on religious subjects which are usually called the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-i Dînîk, and from the colophons of other writings which usually accompany that work, that those answers were composed and certain epistles were written by Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, who was high-priest of Pârs and Kirmân in A.Y. 250 (A.D. 881), and apparently a more important personage than his (probably younger) brother Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparham, who is mentioned in § 11 as one of the priests contemporary with the editor of the TD recension. If this editor, therefore, were a son of Yûdân-Yim (which is a possible interpretation of the text) he was most probably this same Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, author of the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-i Dînîk (see the Introduction. § 4).

[^22]: (147:4) The last name is very probably superfluous, Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparham p. 148 having been written twice most likely by mistake. This Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> son of Mâraspend was probably the one mentioned in the following extract from the old Persian Rivâyat MS., No. 8 of the collection in the Indian Office Library at London (fol. 142 a):—
  ‘The book Dînkar<i>d</i> which the dastûrs of the religion and the ancients have compiled, likewise the blessed Âdarbâd son of Mahrasfend, son of Asavahist of the people of the good religion, in the year three hundred of Yazda<i>g</i>ard Shahryâr, collected some of the more essential mysteries of the religion as instruction, and of these he formed this book.’ That is, he was the last editor of the Dînka<i>r</i>d, which seems to have remained unrevised since his time, as the present copies have descended from the MS. preserved by his family and first copied in A.Y. 369.

[^23]: (148:1) Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparham was brother of the author of the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-i Dînîk; he was high-priest at Sîrkân in the south, and evidently had access to the Bundahi<i>s</i>, of part of which he wrote a paraphrase (see Appendix). His name is usually written Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam.

[^24]: (148:2) In the history of the Dînka<i>r</i>d, given at the end of its third book (see Introd. to Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk, p. xxxiv), we are told as follows:—
  ‘After that, the well-meaning Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> son of Hêmî<i>d</i>, who was the leader of the people of the good religion, compiled, with the assistance of God, through inquiry, investigation, and much trouble, a new means of producing remembrance of the Mazdayasnian religion.’ He did this, we are further told, by collecting all the decaying literature and perishing traditions into a work ‘like the great original Dînkar<i>d</i>, of a thousand chapters’ (mânâk-i zak rabâ bûn Dînô-kartô 1000-darakŏ). We thus learn from external sources that the group of contemporary priests, mentioned in the text, was actively employed (about A.D. 900) in an attempted revival of the religious literature of the Mazdayasnians, to which we owe either the revision or compilation of such works as the Dînkar<i>d</i>, Dâ<i>d</i>istân-i Dînîk, and Bundahi<i>s</i>.
