## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER VIII.

0\. On the conflict which the evil spirit waged with the earth.

1\. As the evil spirit rushed in, the earth shook [^1], _and_ the substance of mountains was created in the earth. 2. First, Mount Albûr<i>z</i> arose; afterwards, <span id="p30"><sup><small>[ p. 30 ]</small></sup></span> the other ranges of mountains (kôfânîhâ) of the middle of the earth; for as Albûr<i>z</i> grew forth all the mountains remained in motion, for they have all grown forth from the root of Albûr<i>z</i>. 3. At that time they came up from the earth, like a tree which _has_ grown up to the clouds _and its_ root [^2] to the bottom; and their root passed on that way _from_ one to the other, _and_ they are arranged in mutual connection. 4. Afterwards, about that wonderful shaking out from the earth, they say that a great mountain is the knot of lands; _and_ the passage for the waters within the mountains is the root which is below the mountains; they forsake the upper _parts_ so that they may flow into it, just as the roots of trees pass into the earth; a counterpart (ângunî-aîtak) of the blood in the arteries of men, which gives strength to the whole body. 5. In numbers [^3], apart from Albûr<i>z</i>, all the mountains grew up out of the earth in eighteen years [^4], from which _arises_ the perfection [^5] of men's advantage.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (29:4) The word <i>g</i>udnî<i>d</i> is a transposition of <i>g</i>undî<i>d</i>, a graphical variant of <i>g</i>unbî<i>d</i>, ‘shook.’

[^2]: (30:1) M6 has ra<i>k</i>âk, but this and many other strange words are probably due to the copyist of that MS. having an original before him which was nearly illegible in many places.

[^3]: (30:2) Or, ‘as it were innumerable;’ the word amar meaning both ‘number’ and ‘innumerable.’

[^4]: (30:3) See Chap. XII, 1.

[^5]: (30:4) The word must be farhâkhtagân, ‘proprieties,’ both here and in Chap. IX, 6, as farhâkhti<i>s</i>n is an ungrammatical form.
