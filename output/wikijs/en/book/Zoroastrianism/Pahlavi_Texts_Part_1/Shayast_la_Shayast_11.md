### PART II.—_A Supplementary Treatise_ [^1]

## SHAYÂST LA-SHAYÂST. CHAPTER XI.

1\. The degrees of sin are these [^2], such _as_ a Farmân, Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâm, Âgerept, Aîvîri<i>s</i>t, Aredû<i>s</i>, Khôr, Bâ<i>z</i>âî, Yât, and Tanâpûhar, and I _will_ mention each of them a second time. 2. A Farmân is the weight of three dirhams of four mads [^3]; a <span id="p335"><sup><small>[ p. 335 ]</small></sup></span> Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâm is one dirham _and_ two mads; three Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâms are the weight of four dirhams and two mads [^4]; an Âgerept is thirty-three stîrs [^5]; an Aîvîri<i>s</i>t is the weight of thirty-three dirhams; an Aredû<i>s</i> is thirty _stîrs_ [^6]; a Khôr is sixty stîrs; a Bâ<i>z</i>âî is ninety stîrs; a Yât is a hundred and eighty stîrs, and a Tanâpûhar is three hundred stîrs.

3\. Every one ought to be unhesitating _and_ unanimous about this, that righteousness is the one thing, and heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân) [^7] the one place, _which_ is good, and contentment the one thing more comfortable.

4\. When a sheep [^8] is slaughtered and divided, its meat-offering (gâvûs-dâk) [^9] is to be thus presented:—the tongue, jaw, and left eye are the <span id="p336"><sup><small>[ p. 336 ]</small></sup></span> angel Hôm‘s [^10] own; the neck is Ashavahi<i>s</i>t’s [^11] own; the head is the angel Vâê‘s [^12] own; the right shoulder (arm) is Ardvîsûr’s [^13], the left is Drvâsp‘s [^14]; the right thigh (hakht) is _for the guardian spirit_ [^15] _of_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, and the left _for_ the guardian spirit of <i>G</i>âmâsp [^16]; the back is _for_ the supreme chief [^17]; the loin is the spirits’ own; the belly is Spendarma<i>d</i>'s [^18]; the testicles [^19] are _for_ the star Vanand [^20] the kidneys are <span id="p337"><sup><small>[ p. 337 ]</small></sup></span> Haptôîring‘s [^21]; the ventricle (naska<i>d</i>akŏ) [^22] is _for_ the guardian spirit of priests; the lungs are _for_ the guardian spirit of warriors; the liver is _for_ compassion and sustenance [^23] of the poor; the spleen is Mânsarspend’s [^24]; the fore-legs (bâ<i>z</i>âî) are _for_ the waters; the heart is _for_ the fires; the entrail fat is Ar<i>d</i>âî-fravar<i>d</i>'s [^25]; the tail-bone (dunb-ga<i>z</i>akŏ) is _for_ the guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân [^26]; the tail (dunbak) is _for_ Vâd [^27] the righteous; the right eye is in the share of the moon [^28]; and any [^29] _that_ may be left over from those is _for_ the other archangels. 5. _There_ have been _those_ who may have spoken about protection, and _there have_ been _those_ who _may have done so_ about meat-offerings; whoever _has_ spoken about protection is such as _has_ <span id="p338"><sup><small>[ p. 338 ]</small></sup></span> spoken well, and whoever _has_ spoken about meat-offerings has not spoken everything which is noteworthy [^30]. 6. When _one_ shall offer up [^31] _what_ pertains to one (khadûkag) on account of another it is proper; except the tongue, jaw, and left eye, for _that_ those are the angel Hôm‘s own is manifest from the passage: ’Hizvãm fr<i>e</i>renao<i>d</i> [^32],' _&c._

## Footnotes

[^1]: (334:1) This second part is evidently by another writer, for he not only repeats several passages (Chaps. XI, 1, 2, XII, 11, 13-16, 18, 20), which are given in the first part, but he also writes generally in a less simple style. In some MSS. of Sls. alone, such as M9, the second part immediately follows the first, as in this translation; indicating that it has been accepted as a part of the same work. But in M6 the two parts are separated by the Farh. Okh., occupying twenty folios; and in K20 there is an interval of ninety-two folios, containing the Farh. Okh., Bund., B. Yt., and several other texts.

[^2]: (334:2) §§ 1, 2 are a repetition of Chap. I, 1, 2, with a few variations. The number of degrees is here raised to nine by the addition of the Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâm (see Chap. X, 24), which is written Srôsha<i>k</i>aranâm in both these sections.

[^3]: (334:3) Reading i mad-4, instead of va m-4; the mad being a quarter-dirham (see Chap. X, 24, note); or we can read ‘weight and quantity (mâyah) of three dirhams.’ The amount of the Farmân p. 335 here given appears to agree with that stated in Chap. XVI, 1, but differs very much from the sixteen dirhams mentioned in Chap. I, 2, and the twenty-eight dirhams quoted by Spiegel.

[^4]: (335:1) That is, one Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâm is one dirham and a half, and three of them, therefore, are four dirhams and a half; the mad being a quarter-dirham. This computation differs considerably from the amounts stated in Chaps. X, 24, XVI, 5, but corresponds better with the supposition (see Chap. IV, 14, note) that a Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâm is one-third of a Farmân.

[^5]: (335:2) Both this amount and the next are evidently wrong, and no doubt the Pahlavi ciphers have been corrupted. Chap. XVI, 5 gives ‘sixteen’ and ‘twenty-five’ stîrs, which are probably correct, though the computation in Chap. I, 2 is very different.

[^6]: (335:3) Written Aredû<i>s</i> 30 sî, ‘an Aredû<i>s</i> is 30 (thirty),’ as in Chap. I, 2; with which also all the remaining amounts correspond.

[^7]: (335:4) See note on pâhlûm ahvân in Chap. VI, 3.

[^8]: (335:5) Or ‘goat.’

[^9]: (335:6) Av. gâu<i>s</i> hudh<i>a</i>u, which is generally represented by a small piece of butter placed upon one of the sacred cakes; but on certain occasions small pieces of meat are used. The object of this section is to point out what part of the animal is suitable for use in a ceremony dedicated to any one of the angels, or spirits, mentioned.

[^10]: (336:1) Av. haoma, the angel of the Hôm plant (see Yas. IX-XI, Bund. XVIII, 1-3, XXVII, 4, 24), the juice of which is used in ceremonial worship by the Parsis.

[^11]: (336:2) The same as Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t (see Bund. I, 216).

[^12]: (336:3) M6 has ‘Râm’ as a gloss; he is the Vayô of the Râm Yt., ‘the good Vaê’ of Mkh. II, 115, who assists the righteous souls in their progress to the other world; his name, Râm, is given to the twenty-first day of the Parsi month (see Chap. XXII, 21).

[^13]: (336:4) Av. Ardvî sûra of the Âbân Yt., a title of Anâhita, the female angel of the waters (see Bund. XXXII, 8). This title is written Arêdvîvsûr in the Bundahi<i>s</i>, and applied to the source of pure water (Bund. XIII); while the name Âvân, ‘waters,’ is given to the eighth month and the tenth day of each month in the Parsi year.

[^14]: (336:5) Av. Drvâspa of the Gô<i>s</i> Yt., the name of the female angel of cattle, called Gô<i>s</i>ûrvan in Bund. IV; her alternative name, Gô<i>s</i>, is given to the fourteenth day of the Parsi month.

[^15]: (336:6) The word fravash-i, ‘the guardian spirit of,’ is evidently omitted here, as it occurs with the next name. For Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, see Bund. XXXI, 29, XXXIV, 7.

[^16]: (336:7) Av. <i>G</i>âmâspa of Yas. XIII, 24, XLV, 17, XLVIII, 9, L, 18, Âbân Yt. 68, &c., the prime minister of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.

[^17]: (336:8) Ratpôk berêza<i>d</i> stands for the Av. rathwô berezatô of Yas. I, 46, &c., a ‘supreme chief’ who is often associated with the chiefs of the various subdivisions of time, and seems to be Aûharmazd himself (see Yas. LVI, i, 10).

[^18]: (336:9) The female archangel who has charge of the earth (see Chap. XV, 5, 20-24, and Bund. I, 26).

[^19]: (336:10) The word gûnd has here, in most MSS., the usual Persian gloss dahân, ‘mouth’ (see Bund. XIX, 1), which is a very improbable meaning in this place.

[^20]: (336:11) Probably Fomalhaut (see Bund. II, 7, note).

[^21]: (337:1) Ursa Major, called Haptôk-ring in Bund. II, 7.

[^22]: (337:2) Translating in accordance with the Persian gloss <i>k</i>ustah, given in the modern MS. M9; but nas-ka<i>d</i>akŏ may perhaps mean ‘the womb.’

[^23]: (337:3) Reading sar-âyi<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘maturity,’ the usual equivalent of Av. thrao<i>s</i>ta (see Yas. XXXIV, 3), and not srâyi<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘chanting.’

[^24]: (337:4) Av. mãthra spe<i>n</i>ta, ‘the beneficent sayings, or holy word,’ of which this angel is a personification; his name is often corrupted into Mahraspend or Mâraspend, and is given to the twenty-ninth day of the Parsi month (see Chap. XXII, 29).

[^25]: (337:5) A personification of the Av. ashaonãm fravashayô, ‘guardian angels of the righteous’ (see Fravardîn Yt. I, &c.), whence the first month, and the nineteenth day of each month, in the Parsi year, are called Fravar<i>d</i>în.

[^26]: (337:6) This clause and the next are omitted in K20.

[^27]: (337:7) The angel of the wind, whose name is given to the twenty-second day of the Parsi month (see Chap. XXII, 22).

[^28]: (337:8) Or its angel, Mâh, whose name is given to the twelfth day of the Parsi month.

[^29]: (337:9) M6 has va aê-maman = va aê<i>k</i> (Pers. î<i>k</i>, ‘any’); K20 has kolâ maman, ‘whatever,’ and omits the words ‘may be left over’ and ‘other.’

[^30]: (338:1) Meaning, apparently, that to pray for protection as a favour is better than to pray for it as a return for an offering.

[^31]: (338:2) K20 has ‘shall give up.’

[^32]: (338:3) It is doubtful if this passage can be found in the extant Avesta; but a passage of similar meaning, and containing the words fr<i>e</i>renao<i>d</i> and hizvô, occurs in Yas. XI, 16, which states that ‘the righteous father, Ahuramazda, produced for me, Haoma, as a Draona, the two jaws, with the tongue and the left eye;’ and it then proceeds (Yas. XI, 17-19) to curse any one ‘who shall deprive me of that Draona, or shalt himself enjoy, or shall give away what the righteous Ahuramazda gave me, the two jaws, with the tongue and the left eye.’
