## Footnotes

[^1]: (401:1) These last two chapters are found written upon some folios which have been added to the beginning of M6; but, though not belonging to that MS. originally, they are still very old. The first of these two chapters has not been found elsewhere; it is an elaborate benediction, in which the writer calls down, upon some one, a series of blessings from each of the thirty archangels and angels whose names are given to the days of the Parsi month in the order in which they here stand (compare the same names in Bund. XXVII, 24).

[^2]: (401:2) The meaning of the word pâ<i>d</i>rô<i>g</i> or pâ<i>d</i>ran<i>g</i> (which occurs also in §§ 12, 26, and appears to be a title) may be guessed from the following passage in the Yâ<i>d</i>kâr-i Zarîrân, or Vi<i>s</i>tâsp-shâh-nâmak: Pavan har ra<i>z</i>m va pâ<i>d</i>ra<i>z</i>m-i lak pîrô<i>g</i> va vêh pâ<i>d</i>rô<i>g</i> <i>s</i>em yâîtûnî-ae, ‘in every attack and counter-attack of thine mayest thou bring _away_ the title of conqueror and good champion!’

[^3]: (401:3) The reading is uncertain.

[^1]: (402:1) This verb is doubtful; here and in § 23 it is netrûnâ<i>d</i>, ‘may she guard,’ but in § 15 it is ketrûnâ<i>d</i>, ‘may she remain.’

[^2]: (402:2) Bûr<i>z</i> âtarô, ‘the sublime fire,’ seems to be a personification of the fire Berezi-savang of Bund. XVII, 1; 3, the Supremely-benefiting of SZS. XI, 1, 6.

[^3]: (402:3) She is usually called an angel. Either the verb is omitted in this section, or it is not a blessing; and the same may be said of §§ 20, 25.

[^4]: (402:4) These are the three fiends, Â<i>z</i>, Aeshm, and Nîyâz (see Bund. XXVIII, 15-17, 26, 27).

[^5]: (402:5) It is very possible that the verb should be yehabûnâ<i>d</i>, p. 403 instead of yehevûnâ<i>d</i>, in which case we should have ‘give thee a passport.’

[^1]: (403:1) The meaning of khvâpar (Av. <i>h</i><i>v</i>âpara) is by no means certain; it is an epithet of Aûharmazd, angels, and spirits, and is then often assumed to mean ‘protecting;’ but it is also a term applied to the earth and offspring; perhaps ‘self-sustaining’ would suit both its etymology and its various applications best, but the root par has many other meanings.

[^2]: (403:2) That is, two great cycles. It is usual for the copyists of Pahlavi MSS. to wish, in their colophons, that the persons for whom the MSS. are written, whether themselves or others, may retain the MSS. for a hundred and fifty years before leaving them to their children; which period is mentioned because it is supposed to constitute a great cycle of the moon and planets.

[^3]: (403:3) Written drûd instead of drû<i>d</i>.

[^1]: (404:1) Both nouns are in the plural, and both verbs in the singular. Anîrân is a personification of Av. anaghra rao<i>k</i><i>a</i>u, ‘the beginningless lights,’ or fixed stars (which, however, are said to have been created by Aûharmazd in Bund. II, 1), and these stars appear to have been considered as horses of the angels (Bund. VI, 3, SZS. VI, 1). There are several uncertain phrases in §§ 30-32.

[^2]: (404:2) This would appear to be the name of the person to whom the benediction is addressed, as it can hardly be meant for the ancient hero Thrita, the Athrat of Bund. XXXI, 27, and the Srîtô of SZS. XI, 10, note.
