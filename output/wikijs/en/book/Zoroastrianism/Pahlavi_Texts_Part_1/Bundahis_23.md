## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. On the nature of the ape _and_ the bear they say, that Yim, when reason (nismô) departed from, him [^3], for fear of the demons took a demoness as wife, and gave Yimak, who was _his_ sister, to a demon as wife; and from them have originated the tailed ape and bear _and_ other species of degeneracy.

2\. This, too, they say, that in the reign of A<i>z</i>\-i Dahâk [^4] a young woman was admitted to a demon, and a young man was admitted to a witch (parîk), and on seeing them they had intercourse; owing to that one intercourse the black-skinned negro arose from them. 3. When Frê<i>d</i>ûn [^5] came to them they fled from the country of Iran, _and_ settled upon the sea-coast; now, _through_ the invasion of the Arabs, they are again diffused through the country of Iran.
