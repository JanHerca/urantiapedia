## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER VII.

1\. The second conflict was waged with the water, because, as the star Tî<i>s</i>tar _was_ in Cancer, the water which is in the subdivision they call Avrak [^1] was <span id="p26"><sup><small>[ p. 26 ]</small></sup></span> pouring, on the same day when the destroyer rushed in, _and_ came again into notice for mischief (âvârak) in the direction of the west. 2. For every single month is the owner of one constellation; the month Tîr is the fourth month [^2] of the year, _and_ Cancer the fourth constellation from Aries, so it is the owner of Cancer, into which Tî<i>s</i>tar sprang, _and_ displayed the characteristics of a producer of rain; and he brought on the water aloft by the strength of the wind. 3. Co-operators with Tî<i>s</i>tar were Vohûman and the angel Hôm, with the assistance of the angel Bûr<i>g</i> and the righteous guardian spirits in orderly arrangement.

4\. Tî<i>s</i>tar was converted into three forms, the form of a man and the form of a horse and the form of a bull [^3]; thirty days _and_ nights he was distinguished in brilliance [^4], and in each form he produced rain ten days _and_ nights; as the astrologers say that every constellation has three forms. 5. Every single drop of that rain became as big as a bowl, and the water stood the height of a man over the whole of this earth; _and_ the noxious creatures on the earth being all killed by the rain, went into the holes of the earth [^5].

<span id="p27"><sup><small>[ p. 27 ]</small></sup></span>

6\. And, afterwards, the wind spirit, so that it may not be contaminated (gûmîkht), stirs up the wind _and_ atmosphere as the life stirs in the body; and the water was all swept away by it, and was brought out to the borders of the earth, and the wide-formed [^6] ocean arose therefrom. 7. The noxious creatures remained dead within the earth, and their venom and stench were mingled with the earth, and in order to carry that poison away from the earth Tî<i>s</i>tar went down into the ocean in the form of a white horse with long hoofs [^7].

8\. And Apâôsh [^8], the demon, came meeting him in the likeness of a black horse with clumsy (kund) hoofs; a mile (parasang) [^9] away from him fled Tî<i>s</i>tar, through the fright which drove _him_ away. 9. And Tî<i>s</i>tar begged for success from Aûharmazd, and Aûharmazd gave _him_ strength and power, as it is said, that unto Tî<i>s</i>tar was brought at once the strength of ten vigorous horses, ten vigorous camels, ten vigorous bulls, ten mountains, and ten rivers [^10]. 10. A mile away from him fled Apâôsh, the demon, through fright at _his_ strength; on account of this they speak of an arrow-_shot_ with Tî<i>s</i>tar's strength in the sense _of a mile_.

<span id="p28"><sup><small>[ p. 28 ]</small></sup></span>

11\. Afterwards, with a cloud for a jar (khûmb)—thus they call the measure which was a means of the work—he seized upon the water _and_ made it rain most prodigiously, in drops _like_ bull‘s heads and men’s heads, pouring in handfuls _and_ pouring in armfuls, both great and small. 12. On the production of that rain the demons Aspen<i>g</i>argâk [^11] _and_ Apâôsh contended _with it_, and the fire Vâzist [^12] turned _its_ club over; and owing to the blow of the club Aspen<i>g</i>argâk made a very grievous noise, as even now, in a conflict with the producer of rain, a groaning and raging [^13] are manifest. 13. And ten nights and days rain was produced by him in that manner, and the poison and venom of the noxious creatures which were in the earth were, all mixed up in the water, and the water became quite salt, because there remained in the earth _some_ of those germs which noxious creatures ever collect.

14\. Afterwards, the wind, in the same manner _as before_, restrained the water, at the end of three days, on various sides of the earth; and the three great seas _and_ twenty-three small seas [^14] arose therefrom, _and_ two fountains (<i>k</i>ashmak) of the sea thereby became manifest, one the <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast lake, and one the Sôvbar [^15], whose sources are connected with the <span id="p29"><sup><small>[ p. 29 ]</small></sup></span> fountain of the sea. 15. And at its north side [^16] two rivers flowed out, _and_ went one to the east _and_ one to the west; they are the Arag river and the Vêh river; as it is said thus: ‘Through those finger-breadth tricklings do thou pour _and_ draw forth two such waters, O Aûharmazd!’ 16. Both those rivers wind about through all the extremities of the earth, and intermingle again with the water of the wide-formed ocean. 17. As those two rivers flowed out, _and_ from the same place of origin as theirs, eighteen [^17] navigable rivers flowed out, and after the other waters have flowed out from those navigable _streams_ they all flow back to the Arag [^18] river and Vêh river, whose fertilization (khvâpardârîh) of the world _arises_ therefrom.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (25:3) The ninth lunar mansion (see Chap. II, 3) corresponding with the middle of Cancer. Tî<i>s</i>tar (Sirius) being in Cancer probably p. 26 means that it rises about the same time as the stars of Cancer, as is actually the case.

[^2]: (26:1) See Chap. XXV, 20.

[^3]: (26:2) See Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 13, 16, 18, where it is stated that Tî<i>s</i>tar assumes the form of a man for the first ten nights, of a bull for the second ten nights, and of a horse for the third ten nights. Also in Vend. XIX, 126 Tî<i>s</i>tar is specially invoked in his form of a bull.

[^4]: (26:3) Or it may be translated, ‘he hovered in the light,’ as Windischmann and Justi have it.

[^5]: (26:4) In comparing the inundation produced by Tî<i>s</i>tar, with the Noachian deluge, it must be recollected that the former is represented as occurring before mankind had propagated on the earth.

[^6]: (27:1) The term farâkû-kar<i>d</i>, ‘wide-formed,’ is a free Pahlavi translation of Av. vouru-kasha, ‘wide-shored,’ or ‘having wide abysses,’ applied to the boundless ocean (see Chap. XIII, 1).

[^7]: (27:2) For the Avesta account of this expedition of Tî<i>s</i>tar, see Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 20-29.

[^8]: (27:3) Miswritten Apav<i>s</i> or Apava<i>s</i> in Pâzand, by all MSS. in this chapter, but see Chap. XXVIII, 39.

[^9]: (27:4) The word parasang is here used for Av. hâthra, which was about an English mile (see Chap. XXVI, 1).

[^10]: (27:5) A quotation from Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 25.

[^11]: (28:1) Mentioned in Vend. XIX, 135, thus: ‘thou shouldst propitiate the fire Vâzi<i>s</i>ta, the smiter of the demon Spen<i>g</i>aghra.’ It, is also written Spên<i>g</i>argâk in Chap. XVII, 1, and Aspen<i>g</i>arôgâ in Chap. XXVIII, 39.

[^12]: (28:2) That is, the lightning (see Chap. XVII, 1).

[^13]: (28:3) Or, ‘a tumult and flashing.’ Justi has ‘howling and shrieking;’ the two words being very ambiguous in the original.

[^14]: (28:4) See Chap. XIII, 6.

[^15]: (28:5) See Chap. XXII, 1-3.

[^16]: (29:1) Probably meaning the north side of the Arêdvîvsûr fountain of the sea, which is said to be on the lofty Hûgar, a portion of Albûr<i>z</i>, from the northern side of which these two semi-mythical rivers are said to flow (see Chaps. XII, 5, XX, 1).

[^17]: (29:2) See Chap. XX, 2.

[^18]: (29:3) Here written Arêng, but the usual Pahlavi reading is Arag; the nasal of the Av. Rangha being generally omitted in Pahlavi, as other nasals are sometimes; thus we often find sag for sang, ‘stone.’
