## SHAYÂST LA-SHAYÂST. CHAPTER XIX.

1\. The Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^1] _formulas_ that are necessary in each place, and how _they_ are to be spoken in performing anything [^2].

2\. One _by him_ who goes forth to an assembly, or before grandees _and_ chieftains, or on any business; or when he goes to ask for what he wants (val khvahî<i>s</i>nŏ); also when he quits any business; in each of these situations _he_ is to say only one _formula_, so that his business may proceed more promptly [^3].

<span id="p391"><sup><small>[ p. 391 ]</small></sup></span>

3\. _That_ a blessing (âfrînô) may be more benedictory, for this _reason one_ utters two _formulas_; for _there_ are two kinds of blessing, one is that which is in the thoughts [^4], and one is that which is in words.

4\. Four are for coming out more thankfully when at a season-festival [^5].

5\. Five _by him_ who goes to atone for sin, in order to expel the fiend; because it is necessary to undergo punishment by the decision (dastôbarîh) of these five persons, the house-ruler, the village-ruler, _the tribe-ruler_ [^6], the province-ruler, and the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t; and five Ashem-vohûs [^7] are to be uttered by him at the end.

6\. Six _by him_ who goes to seek power, and to battle, so that he may be more successful.

<span id="p392"><sup><small>[ p. 392 ]</small></sup></span>

7\. Seven _by him_ who goes to perform the worship of God (yazdân), _so that_ the archangels may come more forward [^8] at the worship.

8\. Eight _by him_ who goes to perform the ceremonial of the righteous guardian spirit.

9\. Nine _by him_ who goes to sow corn; these he utters for this _reason_, because the corn will ripen (rasê<i>d</i>) in nine months, _and_ so that the corn may come forward he will make the mischief of the noxious creatures less [^9].

10\. Ten _by him_ who goes to seek a wife, so that the presents may be favourable for the purpose. 11. Ten _by him_ who wishes to allow the male _access_ to beasts _of burden_ and cattle, so that it may be more procreative [^10].

12\. Eleven _by him_ who goes to the lofty mountains, so that the glory of mountains and hills may bless him _and_ be friendly [^11].

13\. Twelve _by him_ who goes to the low districts, so that the glory of that country and district may bless him and be friendly [^12].

14\. Thirteen _by him_ who shall become pathless; _at_ that same place he shall utter _them_; or _by him_ <span id="p393"><sup><small>[ p. 393 ]</small></sup></span> who shall pass over a bridge and a river, so that the spirit of that water may bless him [^13]; because the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô is greater and more successful _than_ everything in the Avesta as to all rivers, all wholesomeness, and all protection.

15\. Religion is as connected with the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô as the hair is more connected with the glory of the face; any one, indeed, would dread (samâ<i>d</i>) to separate hairiness _and_ the glory of the face.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (390:1) See Bund. I, 21.

[^2]: (390:2) It appears from the ninth book of the Dînkar<i>d</i>, that the contents of this chapter are derived from the first fargar<i>d</i> of the Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask (see B. Yt. I, 1, note). The account given by the Dînkar<i>d</i> contains fewer details, but, so far as it goes, it is in accordance with our text, except that it seems to transfer the object of § 10 to § 12, and removes the objects of §§ 12, 13 one step onwards; it also adds ‘going on a bridge’ to § 2. The Persian Rivâyat of Bahman Pûn<i>g</i>yah gives further details, as will be mentioned in the notes below.

[^3]: (390:3) The Persian Rivâyat adds to these occasions, when he goes on the water, or a river, or goes to borrow, or to ask repayment of a loan, or goes out from his house, or comes into it.

[^4]: (391:1) The words pavan mîni<i>s</i>n are guessed, for this first clause is omitted by mistake in M6, and these two words are illegible in K20, except part of the last letter.

[^5]: (391:2) K20 substitutes for val, ‘at,’ the following mutilated phrase \[. . . . aNh<i>a</i>u khshapô ka<i>d</i>ar<i>k</i>âi pavan ka<i>d</i>âr<i>k</i>âî\] madam vazlûnê<i>d</i> râ<i>d</i>ih-i; the portion in brackets being evidently a fragment from the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Srôsh Yt. 5 with Pahlavi translation (a passage which treats of the efficacy of reciting the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô). If this fragment be not merely a marginal gloss, which has crept into the text by mistake, we must translate the whole section as follows: ‘Four are for the more thankful coming out of the liberality of a season-festival, when the passage, “_on that day nor_ on that night _comes there_ anything whatever on any one,” goes on.’ The Dînkar<i>d</i> has merely: ‘Four by _him_ who is at the invocation of the chiefs _of creation and_ the celebration of a season-festival.’ The Persian Rivâyats omit the section altogether.

[^6]: (391:3) This person is omitted both in M6 and K20, but he is wanted to make up the five. This section is omitted by the Persian Rivâyats.

[^7]: (391:4) See Bund. XX, 2. These are to be recited after the punishment is over.

[^8]: (392:1) Or ‘may arrive earlier;’ there being seven archangels has suggested the number seven. This section and the next are omitted by the Persian Rivâyats.

[^9]: (392:2) The Persian Rivâyats add general cultivation, planting trees, and cohabitation with one's wife.

[^10]: (392:3) Instead of §§ 10, 11 the Persian Rivâyats have buying quadrupeds, and driving pegs into the ground for picketing them.

[^11]: (392:4) The Persian Rivâyats substitute conference with a maiden, seeking a wife, giving one's children in marriage, and obtaining anything from another.

[^12]: (392:5) The Persian Rivâyats add going up hills, mounting anything lofty, going on a bridge, and losing one's way.

[^13]: (393:1) The Persian Rivâyats substitute going to and entering a city or town; they also add twenty-one recitations on setting out on a journey, so that the angel Bahrâm may grant a safe arrival.
