## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXXI [^1]

0\. On the race and genealogy of the Kayâns.

1\. Hôshyang [^2] _was son_ of Fravâk, _son_ of Sîyâkmak [^3], _son_ of Mâshya  [^4], _son_ of Gâyômar<i>d</i>. \[2. Takhmôrup [^5] _was son_ of Vîvanghâû [^6], _son_ of Yangha<i>d</i> [^7], _son_ of Hôshyang. 3. Yim,\] [^8] Takhmôrup, Spîtûr [^9], _and_ Narsih [^10], whom they also call ‘the Rashnû of <i>K</i>înŏ [^11],’

<span id="p131"><sup><small>[ p. 131 ]</small></sup></span>

were all brothers 4. From Yim and Yimak [^12], who was _his_ sister, was born a pair, man _and_ woman, and they became husband _and_ wife together; Mîrak the Âspiyân [^13] and Zîyânak Zardâhim were _their_ names, _and_ the lineage went on. 5. Spîtûr was he who, with Dahâk, cut up Yim [^14]; 3; Narsih [^15] lived then [^16] also, _whom_ they call Nêsr-gyâvân [^17]; they say that such destiny (gadman) is allotted to him [^18], that he shall pass every day in troubles, and shall make all food purified _and_ pure.

6\. Dahâk [^19] _was son_ of Khrûtâsp, _son_ of Zâînîgâv, <span id="p132"><sup><small>[ p. 132 ]</small></sup></span> _son_ of Viraf<i>s</i>ang, _son_ of Tâ<i>z</i>, _son_ of Fravâk, _son_ of Sîyâkmak [^20]; by _his_ mother Dahâk _was_ of Udaî [^21], _son_ of Bayak, _son_ of Tambayak, _son_ of Owokhm [^22], _son_ of Pairi-urvaêsm [^23], _son_ of Gadhwithw [^24], _son_ of Drû<i>g</i>âskân [^25], _son_ of the evil spirit.

7\. Frê<i>d</i>ûn the Âspiyân [^26] _was son of_ Pûr-tôrâ [^27] the Âspiyân, _son_ of Sôk-tôrâ [^28] the Âspiyân, _son_ of Bôr-tôrâ the Âspiyân, _son_ of Sîyâk-tôrâ the Âspiyân, _son_ of Spê<i>d</i>\-tôrâ the Âspiyân, _son_ of Gefar-tôrâ the Âspiyân, _son_ of Ramak-tôrâ the Âspiyân, _son_ of <span id="p133"><sup><small>[ p. 133 ]</small></sup></span> Vanfraghe<i>s</i>n [^29] the Âspiyân, _son_ of Yim, _son_ of Vîvanghâû; as these, apart from the Âspiyân Pûr-tôrâ, were ten generations, they every one lived a hundred years, which becomes one thousand years; those thousand years were the evil reign of Dahâk. 8. By the Âspiyân Pûr-tôrâ was begotten Frê<i>d</i>ûn, who exacted vengeance for Yim; together _with him_ [^30], also were the sons Barmâyûn _and_ Katâyûn, _but_ Frê<i>d</i>ûn was fuller of glory than they.

9\. By Frê<i>d</i>ûn three sons were begotten, Salm and Tû<i>g</i> and Aîrî<i>k</i> [^31]; and by Aîrî<i>k</i> one son _and_ one pair [^32] were begotten; the names of the couple of sons were Vânî<i>d</i>âr _and_ Anastokh [^33], _and_ the name of the daughter was Gû<i>z</i>ak [^34]. 10. Salm _and_ Tû<i>g</i> slew _them_ all, Aîrî<i>k</i> and _his_ happy sons, _but_ Frê<i>d</i>ûn kept the daughter in concealment, _and_ from that daughter a daughter was born [^35]; they became aware _of it_, and the mother was slain by them. 11. Frê<i>d</i>ûn provided for the daughter [^36], also in concealment, for <span id="p134"><sup><small>[ p. 134 ]</small></sup></span> ten generations, when Mânû<i>s</i>\-i Khûrshê<i>d</i>\-vînîk was born from _his_ mother, \[_so called_ because, as he was born, _some_ of\] [^37] the light of the sun (khûrshê<i>d</i>) fell upon _his_ nose (vînîk). 12. From Mânû<i>s</i>\-i Khûrshê<i>d</i>\-vînîk _and his_ sister [^38] was Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnar, _and_ from Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnar \[_and his_ sister\] was Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar born [^39], by whom Salm and Tû<i>g</i> were slain in revenge for Aîrî<i>k</i> [^40]. 13. By Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar were Fri<i>s</i>, Nô<i>d</i>ar [^41], and Dûrâsrôb [^42] begotten.

14\. Just as Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar _was of_ Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnar, of Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnâk [^43], who was Mâm-sozak [^44], of Aîrak, of Thritak, of Bîtak, of Frazû<i>s</i>ak, of Zû<i>s</i>ak [^45], of Fragûzak, of Gûzak, of Aîrî<i>k</i>, of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, _so_ Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> [^46] _was_ <span id="p135"><sup><small>[ p. 135 ]</small></sup></span> of Pashang, of Zaê<i>s</i>m [^47], of Tûrak, of Spaênyasp, of Dûrôshasp, of Tû<i>g</i>, of Frê<i>d</i>ûn. 15. He (Frâsîyâ<i>v</i>) as well as Karsêvaz [^48], whom they call Kadân [^49], _and_ Aghrêra<i>d</i> [^50] were all three brothers.

\[16 [^51]. Pashang and Vîsak were both brothers. 17. By Vîsak were Pîrân [^52], Hûmân, <i>S</i>ân [^53], and other brothers begotten. 18. By Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> were Frasp-i Kûr, <i>S</i>ân, Shê<i>d</i>ak [^54], and other sons begotten; _and_ Vispân-fryâ [^55], from whom Kaî-Khûsrôb was born, was daughter of Frâsîyâ<i>v</i>, _and_ was of the same mother with Frasp-i Kûr. 19. From Frasp-i Kûr _were_ Sûrâk, Asûrîk, and other children; _and_ by them were Khvâst-aîrikht, Yazdân-aîrikht, Yazdân-<i>s</i>arâ<i>d</i>, Frêh-khûr<i>d</i>, Lâ-vahâk [^56], and others begotten, a recital of whom _would_ be tedious.

20\. By Aghrêra<i>d</i> _was_ Gôpatshah [^57] begotten. 21. When Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> made Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, with the Iranians, captive in the mountain-range (gar) of <span id="p136"><sup><small>[ p. 136 ]</small></sup></span> Padashkh-vâr [^58], _and_ scattered ruin _and_ want among them, Aghrêra<i>d</i> begged a favour of God (yazdân), and he obtained the benefit that the army and champions of the Iranians were saved by him from that distress. 22. Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> slew Aghrêra<i>d</i> for that fault; _and_ Aghrêra<i>d</i>, as his recompense, begat _such_ a son as Gôpatshah.

23\. Aûzôbô the Tûhmâspian [^59], Kanak-i Barzi<i>s</i>t, Arawi<i>s</i>anasp, _and_ Vaêta<i>n</i><i>d</i>\-i Râghinôi<i>d</i> _were_ the three sons _and_ the daughter of Agâima<i>s</i>vâk [^60], the _son_ of Nô<i>d</i>ar, _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, who begat Aûzôbô. 24. Kavâ<i>d</i> [^61] was a child in a waist-cloth (kuspû<i>d</i>) they abandoned _him_ on a river, _and_ he froze upon the door-sills (kavâ<i>d</i>akân); Aûzôbô perceived and took _him_, brought _him_ up, _and_ settled the name of the trembling child.

25\. By Kavâ<i>d</i> _was_ Kaî-Apîvêh begotten; by Kaî-Apîvêh _were_ Kaî-Arsh, Kaî-Vyârsh, Kaî-Pisân, and Kaî-Kâûs begotten; by Kaî-Kâûs _was_ Sîyâvakhsh begotten; by Sîyâvakhsh _was_ Kaî-Khûsrôb [^62]

<span id="p137"><sup><small>[ p. 137 ]</small></sup></span>

begotten. 26. Keresâsp [^63] _and_ Aûrvakhsh [^64] were both brothers. 27. Athrat [^65] _was son_ of Sâhm, _son_ of Tûrak, _son_ of Spaênyasp, _son_ of Dûrôshasp [^66], _son_ of Tû<i>g</i>, _son_ of Frê<i>d</i>ûn. 28. Lôharâsp [^67] _was son_ of Aûzâv [^68], _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i>, _son of_ Kaî-Pîsîn [^69], _son of_ Kaî-Apîvêh, _son of_ Kaî-Kavâ<i>d</i>. 29. _By_ Kaî-Lôharâsp were Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, Zarîr [^70], _and_ other brothers begotten; by Vi<i>s</i>tâsp were Spend-dâ<i>d</i> [^71] and Pêshyô-tanû [^72] begotten; and by Spend-dâ<i>d</i> were Vohûman [^73], Âtarô-tarsah, Mitrô-tarsah, _and_ others begotten.

30\. Artakhshatar _descendant_ of Pâpak—of whom his mother _was_ daughter—_was son_ of Sâsân [^74], _son_ of <span id="p138"><sup><small>[ p. 138 ]</small></sup></span> Vêh-âfrî<i>d</i> and [^75] Zarîr, _son_ of Sâsân, _son_ of Artakhshatar who _was_ the said Vohûman _son_ of Spend-dâ<i>d</i>.

31\. The mother of Kaî-Apîvêh was Farhank [^76], _daughter_ of _him who is_ exalted on the _heavenly_ path [^77], Urva<i>d</i>\-gâi-frâ<i>s</i>t [^78], _son_ of Râk, _son_ of Dûrâsrôb, _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar. 32. This, too, it says, that the glory [^79] of Frê<i>d</i>ûn settled on the root of a reed (kanyâ) in the wide-formed ocean; _and_ Nôktargâ [^80], through sorcery, formed a cow for tillage, _and_ begat _children_ there; three years he carried the reeds there, _and_ gave them to the cow, until the glory went on to the cow; he brought the cow, milked _her_ milk, _and_ gave _it_ to his three sons; as _their_ walking _was on_ hoofs, the glory did not go to the sons, but to Farhank. 33. Nôktargâ wished to injure [^81] Farhank, _but_ Farhank went with the glory _away_ from <span id="p139"><sup><small>[ p. 139 ]</small></sup></span> the fierce (tîb) father, and made a vow (patyastâk) thus: ‘I will give _my_ first son to Aûshbâm [^82].’ 34. Then Aûshbâm saved her from the father; and the first son, Kaî-Apîvêh, she bore and gave to Aûshbâm, was a hero associating with Aûshbâm, and travelled in Aûshbâm's company.

35\. The mother of Aûzôbô was the daughter of Nâmûn the wizard, when Nâmak [^83] was with Frâsîyâ<i>v</i>.

36\. And, moreover, together with those begotten by <i>S</i>âm [^84] were six children in pairs, male _and_ female; the name of one _was_ Damnak, of one Khûsrôv, _and of one_ Mârgandak, _and_ the name of _each_ man and woman together was one. 37. And the name of one _besides_ them was Dastân [^85]; he was considered more eminent than they, and Sagânsîh [^86] and the southern quarter were given to him; and Avar-shatrô [^87] and the governorship were given by him to Avarnak. 38. of Avar-shatrô this is said, that _it is_ the district of Avarnak, _and_ they offered blessings _to_ Srôsh and Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t in succession; on this account is _their_ possession of horses and possession of arms; and on account of firm religion, purity, and manifest joy, good estimation and extensive fame are greatly <span id="p140"><sup><small>[ p. 140 ]</small></sup></span> among them. 39. To Damnak the governorship of Asûristân was given; sovereignty and arranging the law of sovereignty, wilfulness and the stubborn defects they would bring, were among them. 40. To Sparnak [^88] the governorship of Spâhân [^89] was given; to Khûsrôv the governorship of Râi [^90] was given; to Mârgandak the kingdom, forest settlements, and mountain settlements of Padashkhvârgar were given; _where_ they travel nomadically, and _there are_ the forming of sheep-folds, prolificness, easy procreation, and continual triumph over enemies. 41. From Dastân proceeded Rû<i>d</i>astâm [^91] and Hûzavârak [^92].\]

## Footnotes

[^1]: (130:1) For this chapter, which is numbered XXXII by previous translators, we have to depend only on K20, TD, and K20b (a fragment evidently derived from the same original as K20 and M6, but through some independent line of descent).

[^2]: (130:2) So in K20, but usually Hôshâng (see Chaps. XV, 28, XXXIV, 3, 4).

[^3]: (130:3) See Chap. XV, 25,30.

[^4]: (130:4) See Chaps. XV, 2-24, 30, XXXIV, 3.

[^5]: (130:5) Av. Takhmô-urupa of Râm Yt. 11, Zamyâd Yt. 28, Âfrîn Zarat. 2; written Tâkhmôrup in TD, which is the only MS. in which the passage enclosed in brackets is found, the omission of which by K20 was suspected by Windischmann (Zoroastriche Studien, p. 199). This king is the Tahmûras of the Shâhnâmah. See also Chaps. XVII, 4, XXXIV, 4.

[^6]: (130:6) Av. Vîvan<i>g</i>h<i>a</i>u of Yas. IX, 11, 20, XXXII, 8, Vend. II, 8, 28, 94, Fravardîn Yt. 130, Zamyâd Yt. 35.

[^7]: (130:7) As this Pâzand name or title begins with a _medial_ y, its initial vowel is probably omitted (see p. 141, note 8).

[^8]: (130:8) Av. Yima or Yima khshaêta of Vend. II, &c., the Jamshêd of the Shâhnâmah (see Chaps. XVII. 5, XXXIV, 4).

[^9]: (130:9) Av. Spityura of Zamyâd Yt. 46.

[^10]: (130:10) Here written Nârsî in K20, and K20b, and Nôsîh in TD; but see § 5 and Chap. XXIX, 6. Windischmann suggests that he may be the Av. Aoshnara pouru-<i>g</i>îra of Fravardîn Yt. 131, Âf. Zarat. 2.

[^11]: (130:11) An epithet equivalent to ‘the Minos of China;’ Rashnû being the angel of justice, who is said to weigh the meritorious deeds of p. 131 the departed soul against its sins. Neither word is, however, quite certain, as rashnûk may stand for rasnîk, ‘spear,’ and has also been translated by ‘light’ and ‘hero;’ <i>K</i>înŏ, moreover, was probably not China, but Samarkand (see Chaps. XII, 13, 22, XV, 29).

[^12]: (131:1) See Chap. XXIII, 1.

[^13]: (131:2) Av. Âthwyâna of Âbân. Yt. 33, Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 13, Fravardîn Yt. 131, Zamyâd Yt. 36, &c., where it is the family name of Thraêtaona, who is said to be a son of Âthwya in Yas. IX, 23, 24. In the text this name seems to be used rather as a title than a patronymic, and in § 7 it appears to be a family surname.

[^14]: (131:3) As stated in Zamyâd Yt. 46.

[^15]: (131:4) Here written Nârsak in K20 and K20b, and Nôsîh in TD.

[^16]: (131:5) TD has ‘together,’ instead of ‘then.’

[^17]: (131:6) So in K20, but K20b has Narst-gyâvân, and TD has Nôsîh-vîyâvânîk (or nîyâzânîk). Perhaps we may assume the epithet to have been nîgîr-vîyâvânîk (or nîyâzânîk), ‘one with a bewildering (or longing) glance.’

[^18]: (131:7) Justi supposes this clause of the sentence refers to Yim and the disease which attacked his hand. If this be the case it may be translated as follows: ‘they say aîghash is produced on his hand (yadman), so that,’ &c.; aîghash being a disease, or evil, mentioned in Vend. XX, 14, 20, 24; compare Chap. XXVIII, 33.

[^19]: (131:8) Or A<i>z</i>\-i Dahâk, the Av. A<i>z</i>i Dahâka, ‘destructive serpent,’ of Yas. IX, 25, Vend. I, 69, Âbân Yt. 29, 34, Bahrâm Yt. 40, Zamyâd Yt. 46-50. A name applied to a foreign dynasty (probably Semitic) personified as a single king, which conquered the dominions of Yim (see Chap. XXXIV, 5).

[^20]: (132:1) For the last three names, see Chap. XV, 25, 28.

[^21]: (132:2) Pahl. Aû<i>d</i> in TD; compare ‘the demon Uda’ of Chap. XXVIII, 19. The following two names look like ‘fear’ and ‘gloom-fear,’ both appropriate names for demons.

[^22]: (132:3) TD has Pâz. Owôikh; compare Av. aoiwra, ‘a species of nightmare,’ observing that r and ô are often written alike in Pahlavi.

[^23]: (132:4) TD and K20b have Paz. Pairi-urva-urvaêsm, and K20 has Pai-urvaêsm.

[^24]: (132:5) TD has Pâz. Gawithw.

[^25]: (132:6) So in TD, but K20 has Pâz. Dru<i>z</i>\-i ayaskâ, and K20b has Dru<i>g</i>\-i ayaskâ. It corresponds to Av. dru<i>g</i>aska in Vend. XIX, 139, Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Yt. 26. This genealogy appears to trace Dahâk's maternal descent through a series of demons.

[^26]: (132:7) Av. Thraêtaona, son of Âthwya, but generally called ‘the Âthwyânian,’ who slew the destructive serpent (a<i>z</i>i dahâka), see Yas. IX, 24, 25, Vend. I, 69, Âbân Yt. 33, 61, Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 13, Fravardîn Yt. 131, Bahrâm Yt. 40, Râm Yt. 23, Ashi Yt. 33, Zamyâd Yt. 36, 92, Âf. Zarat. 2. In the Shâhnâmah he is called Ferîdûn son of Abtîn.

[^27]: (132:8) This name is omitted in K20, but occurs in the other two MSS.; it is a Huzvâri<i>s</i> hybrid equivalent to Pâz. Pûr-g<i>a</i>u and Av. Pouru-g<i>a</i>u which is. a title of an Âthwyânian in Âf. Zarat. 4, Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Yt. 2. This genealogy consists almost entirely of such hybrid names, which have a very artificial appearance, though suitable enough for a race of herdsmen, meaning, as they severally do, ‘one with abundant oxen, with useful oxen, with the brown ox, with the black ox, with the white ox, with the fat ox, and with a herd of oxen.’

[^28]: (132:9) So in TD, but the other two MSS. have Sîyâk-tôrâ, which is probably wrong, as the same name occurs again in this genealogy.

[^29]: (133:1) In TD this name can be read Vanfrôki<i>s</i>n or Vanfrôkgân.

[^30]: (133:2) TD has ‘as well as _him_.’ K20b omits most of this sentence by mistake.

[^31]: (133:3) These sons, as Windischmann observes, are not mentioned in the extant Avesta, but their Avesta names, Sairima, Tûirya or Tûra, and Airya or Airyu, may be gathered from the names of the countries over which they are supposed to have ruled (see Fravardîn Yt. 143).

[^32]: (133:4) TD has ‘two sons _and_ one daughter.’

[^33]: (133:5) TD has Anî<i>d</i>âr and Anastabŏ.

[^34]: (133:6) Or Gû<i>g</i>ak, in TD; the other MSS. have Pâz. Gan<i>g</i>a here, but Guzak in § 14; it is identical with the name of Hôshyang‘s sister and wife in Chap. XV, 28. in the Pâzand <i>G</i>âmâsp-nâmah the name of Frê<i>d</i>ûn’s daughter is written Vîrak.

[^35]: (133:7) Reading min zak dûkht dûkht-i zâ<i>d</i>, as in K20b and TD; some uncertainty arises here from the words dûkht, ‘daughter,’ and dvâ<i>d</i>, ‘pair,’ being written alike in Pahlavi.

[^36]: (133:8) TD has bartman, ‘daughter,’ indicating that the word in K20 must be read dûkht, and not dvâ<i>d</i>, ‘pair.’

[^37]: (134:1) The phrase in brackets occurs only in TD; and the whole passage from ‘vînîk’ to ‘sun’ is omitted in K20, evidently by mistake.

[^38]: (134:2) TD has ‘from Manû<i>s</i> and _his_ sister,’ and K20b ‘has from Mânû<i>s</i>\-hû<i>k</i>îhar _and_ Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrshêd.’

[^39]: (134:3) The words in brackets occur only in TD, and K20b has ‘from Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnar also was Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnâk, _from_ Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnâk was Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar born,’ but this introduction of an extra generation is not confirmed by the list of names in § 14. The term khûrnâk (or khûrnak) seems to be merely a transcript of the Avesta word of which khûrshê<i>d</i>\-vînîk, ‘sun-nose,’ is a translation. The other term khûrnar can also be read khûrvar, but K20 has Pâz. <i>h</i><i>v</i>arnar. Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar is the Av. Manus<i>k</i>ithra of Fravardîn Yt. 131, where he is styled the Airyavan, or descendant of Airyu (Aîrî<i>k</i>).

[^40]: (134:4) TD has ‘_and_ vengeance exacted for Aîrî<i>k</i>.’

[^41]: (134:5) See Chap. XXIX, 6.

[^42]: (134:6) Pâz. Durâsro, but the Pahlavi form, given in the text, occurs in § 31 and Chap. XXXII, 1 in TD, which MS. omits this § by mistake.

[^43]: (134:7) The same as Mânû<i>s</i>\-i khûrshê<i>d</i>\-vînîk, as noted above.

[^44]: (134:8) This Pâzand epithet seems to mean ‘mother-burning,’ and may have some connection with the legend mentioned in § 11. TD has mûn am Gû<i>g</i>ak, ‘whose mother was Gû<i>g</i>ak.’

[^45]: (134:9) K20b omits the five names from Aîrak to Zû<i>s</i>ak.

[^46]: (134:10) Av. Frangrasyan, the Tûryan, of Yas. XI, 21, Âbân Yt. 41, p. 135 Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 18, 22, Ashi Yt. 38, 42, Zamyâd Yt. 56-63, 62, 93; called Afrâsiyâb in the Shâhnâmah.

[^47]: (135:1) Zâd<i>s</i>am in the Shâhnâmah.

[^48]: (135:2) Garsîvaz in the Shâhnâmah.

[^49]: (135:3) TD has Pahl. Kî<i>d</i>ân.

[^50]: (135:4) See Chap. XXIX, 5.

[^51]: (135:5) The remainder of this chapter is found only in TD.

[^52]: (135:6) Pîrân Vîsah is Afrâsiyâb's chief general in the Shâhnâmah and Hûmân and Pîlsam are his brothers.

[^53]: (135:7) This name is very ambiguous in Pahlavi, as it can be read many other ways.

[^54]: (135:8) Shêdah in the Shâhnâmah.

[^55]: (135:9) She is called Farangîs in the Shâhnâmah.

[^56]: (135:10) The reading of several of these names is more or less uncertain, but the object of the author is evidently to apply opprobrious epithets to all the male descendants of Afrâsiyâb.

[^57]: (135:11) TD has Gôpat-malkâ here, as also in Chap. XXIX, 5, where it is said to be a title of Aghrêra<i>d</i> (always written Agrêra<i>d</i> in TD).

[^58]: (136:1) The mountains south of the Caspian (see Chap. XII. 17).

[^59]: (136:2) Av. Uzava Tûmâspana of Fravardîn Yt. 131, called Zav, or Zâb, son of Tahmâsp, in the Shâhnâmah.

[^60]: (136:3) None of these names, which TD gives in Pâzand, are to be found in the portion of the Avesta yet extant.

[^61]: (136:4) Av. Kavi Kavâta of Fravardîn Yt. 132, Zamyâd Yt. 71, called Kaî-Qubâd in the Shâhnâmah. There appears to be an attempt, in the text, to derive his name from the ‘door-sill’ on which he is said to have been found.

[^62]: (136:5) The Avesta names of these seven other Kayâns are, respectively, Kavi Aipi-vanghu, Kavi Arshan, Kavi Byârshân, Kavi Pisanangh, Kavi Usadhan, Kavi Syâvarshân, and Kavi Husravangh (see Fravardîn Yt. 132, Zamyâd Yt. 71, 74); omitting the third, they are called, respectively, Armîn, Ari<i>s</i>, Pa<i>s</i>în, Kaî-Kâvûs, Siyâvush, and Kaî-Khusrô in the Shâhnâmah. TD, omitting the first letter, has Sânŏ for Pisân; it also writes Kaî-Kâyûks and Kei-Khûsrôvî.

[^63]: (137:1) Av. Keresâspa of Yas. IX, 31, 36, 39, Vend. I, 36, Âbân Yt. 37, Fravardîn Yt. 61, 136, Râm Yt. 27, Zamyâd Yt. 38-44, Âf. Zarat. 3; he is called Gar<i>s</i>âsp in the Shâhnâmah.

[^64]: (137:2) Av. Urvâkhshaya of Yas. IX, 31, Râm Yt. 28, Âf. Zarat. 3. These brothers were sons of Thrita or Athrat, mentioned in the next §.

[^65]: (137:3) Av. Thrita of the Sâma race (see Yas. IX, 30, Vend. XX, 11) and father of Keresâspa, whose genealogy is given in a passage interpolated in some copies of the Shâhnâmah as follows: Gar<i>s</i>âsp, Atrat, <i>S</i>am, Tûrag, <i>S</i>îdasb, Tûr, Jamshêd.

[^66]: (137:4) Written Dûrôshap in TD, both here and in § 14.

[^67]: (137:5) Av. Aurva<i>d</i>\-aspa of Âbân Yt. 105, Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Yt. 34, 46, called Luhrâsp in the Shâhnâmah.

[^68]: (137:6) Reading doubtful.

[^69]: (137:7) Written Ka-Pîsîn here, but he is the same person as Kaî-Pisân of § 25; the latter part of the name is written both Pisanangh and Pisina in the Avesta.

[^70]: (137:8) Probably Zargar (being Av. Zairivairi of Âbân Yt. 112, 117, Fravardîn Yt. 101), but called Zarîr in the Shâhnâmah.

[^71]: (137:9) Av. Spe<i>n</i>tô-dâta of Fravardîn Yt. 103. Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Yt. 25, called Isfendiyâr in the Shâhnâmah.

[^72]: (137:10) See Chaps. XXIX, 5, XXXII, 5.

[^73]: (137:11) Called Bahman in the Shâhnâmah, and Ar<i>d</i>ashîr the Kayânian in Bahman Yt. II, 17; the successor of his grandfather Vi<i>s</i>tâsp (see Chap. XXXIV, 8).

[^74]: (137:12) The text is rather obscure, but the Kârnâmak of Ar<i>d</i>ashîr-i Pâpakân states clearly that Ar<i>d</i>ashîr was son of Sâsân by the p. 138 daughter of Pâpak, a tributary ruler of Pârs under Ardavân, the last of the A<i>s</i>kâniyân monarchs.

[^75]: (138:1) So in the Pahlavi text, which therefore makes Vêh-âfrî<i>d</i> a woman‘s name (like Pers. Beh-âfrîn); but this is doubtful, as the MSS. often confound va, ’and,‘ and i, ’_son_ of.'

[^76]: (138:2) In the Shâhnâmah Farhang is mother of Kaî-Kâvûs. The Pahlavi name can also be read Farânak, the name of the mother of Ferîdûn in the Shâhnâmah.

[^77]: (138:3) Pâz. vîdharg-âfrâr<i>s</i>taka, which looks more like an epithet than a name.

[^78]: (138:4) Or, perhaps, ‘Urva<i>d</i>\-gâ _son_ of Frâ<i>s</i>t.’

[^79]: (138:5) The divine glory which was supposed to accompany all legitimate sovereigns of Iran, from the time of Hôshyang even to that of the Sasanian dynasty; it is the Av. <i>h</i><i>v</i>arenangh of the Zamyâd Ya<i>s</i>t, and is said to have fled to the ocean for refuge during the reign of foreign dynasties and wicked kings (see Âbân Yt. 42, Zamyâd Yt. 51, 56, 59, 62).

[^80]: (138:6) The last syllable is so written, in Pâzand, in § 33.

[^81]: (138:7) Reading han<i>g</i>î<i>d</i>anŏ, to injure,‘ instead of khun<i>g</i><i>d</i>anŏ, which may mean ’to embrace;' the difference between the two words being merely the letter î.

[^82]: (139:1) This name means ‘the dawn;’ perhaps it may be identified with Av. Usinemangh or Usenemangh of Fravardîn Yt. 113, 1401 whose wife Fr<i>e</i>ni may possibly be the Farhank (or Frânak) of the text.

[^83]: (139:2) So in TD, but it is probably only a variant of Nâmûn.

[^84]: (139:3) The grandfather of Rustam (see § 41). In the Avesta he is usually called Sâma Keresâspa with the title Nairiman<i>a</i>u; while in the Shâhnâmah <i>S</i>âm is son of Narîmân.

[^85]: (139:4) Another name for Zâl, the father of Rustam, in the Shâhnâmah.

[^86]: (139:5) The same as Sagastân.

[^87]: (139:6) Or, perhaps, ‘the upper district.’

[^88]: (140:1) He would seem not to have been a son of Sâm, as he is not mentioned before. The reading of all these names is uncertain.

[^89]: (140:2) The Pahlavi form of Ispahân.

[^90]: (140:3) Av. Ragha of Yas. XIX, 51, Vend. I, 60, whose ruins are near the modern Teherân.

[^91]: (140:4) The usual Pahlavi form of Rustam.

[^92]: (140:5) Or Aûzvârak; Rustam's brother is called Zavârah in the Shâhnâmah.
