## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER IX.

1\. As he (Aharman) came fifthly to cattle—which struggled against him with all the animals—and likewise as the primeval ox [^1] passed away, from, the nature of the vegetable principle it possessed, fifty-five [^2] species of grain and twelve species of medicinal plants grew from _its_ various members; _and_ forasmuch as they should see from which member each one _proceeds_, it is declared in the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> _Nask_ [^3]. 2. And every plant grown from a member <span id="p178"><sup><small>[ p. 178 ]</small></sup></span> promotes that member, as it is said that there _where_ the ox scattered _its_ marrow [^4] on to the earth, grain afterwards grew up, corn [^5] and sesame, vetches [^6] _and_ peas; so sesame, on account of [^7] _its_ marrow quality, is itself a great thing for developing marrow. 3. And it is also said that from the blood is the vine [^8], a great vegetable thing—as wine itself is blood—for more befriending the sound quality of the blood. 4. And it is said that from the nose is the pulse (mây<i>s</i> or mâsah) which is called dônak, and was a variety of sesame (<i>s</i>amagâ) [^9], _and it is_ for other noses.

<span id="p179"><sup><small>[ p. 179 ]</small></sup></span>

5\. And it is also said that from the lungs are the rue-like herbs [^10] _which_ heal, and are for the lung-disease of cattle. 6. This, rooted amid the heart, is thyme, from which is Vohûman's thorough withstanding of the stench of Akôman [^11], and _it is_ for that which _proceeds_ from the sick and yawners.

7\. Afterwards, the brilliance of the seed, seized upon, by strength, from the seed _which_ was the ox's, they would carry _off_ from it, _and_ the brilliance was intrusted to the angel of the moon [^12]; in a place therein that seed was thoroughly purified by the light of the moon, and was restored in its many qualities, and made fully infused with life (<i>g</i>ânvar-hômand). 8. Forth from there it produced for Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, first, two oxen, a pair, male and female [^13], _and_, afterwards, other species, until the completion of the 282 species [^14]; and they were discernible as far as two long leagues _on_ the earth. 9. Quadrupeds walked forth on the land, fish swam in the water, _and_ birds flew _in_ the atmosphere; _in_ every two, at the time good eating is enjoyed, a longing (â<i>v</i>dahân) arose therefrom, and pregnancy and birth.

10\. Secondly, their subdivision is thus:—First, they are divided into three, that is, quadrupeds walking on the earth, fish swimming in the water, <span id="p180"><sup><small>[ p. 180 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ birds flying in the atmosphere. 11. Then, into five classes [^15], that is, the quadruped which is round-hoofed, the double-hoofed, the five-clawed, the bird, _and_ the fish, whose dwellings are in five places, _and_ which are called aquatic, burrowing, oviparous, wide-travelling, _and_ suitable for grazing. 12. The aquatic are fish _and_ every beast of burden, cattle, wild beast, dog, _and_ bird which enters the water; the burrowing are the marten (samûr) and musk _animals_, and all other dwellers and movers in holes; the oviparous are birds of every kind; the wide-travelling sprang away for help, and are also those of a like kind; those suitable for grazing are whatever are kept grazing in a flock.

13\. And, afterwards, they were divided into genera, as the round-hoofed are one, _which_ is all called ‘horse;’ the double-hoofed are many, as the camel and ox, the sheep and goat, _and_ others double-hoofed; the five-clawed are the dog, hare, musk _animals_, marten, _and_ others; then are the birds, and then the fish. 14. And then they were divided into species [^16], as eight species of horse, two species of camel, ten [^17] species of ox, five species of sheep, five species of goat, ten of the dog, five of the hare, eight of the marten, eight of the musk _animals_, 110 of the birds, and ten of the fish; some are counted for the pigs, and with all those declared _and_ all those undeclared _there were_, at first, 282 species [^18]; _and_ with the species within species _there were_ a thousand varieties.

<span id="p181"><sup><small>[ p. 181 ]</small></sup></span>

15\. The birds are distributed [^19] into eight groups (rîstakŏ), and from that which is largest to that which is smallest _they_ are so spread about as _when_ a man, who is sowing grain, first scatters abroad _that of_ heavy weight, then that which is middling, _and_ afterwards that which is small.

16\. And of the whole of the species, as enumerated a second time in the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> _Nask_ [^20], and written by me in the manuscript (nipîk) of ‘the summary enumeration of races [^21]’—this is a lordly [^22] summary—the matter which is shown is, about the species of horses, the first is the Arab, and the chief of them [^23] is white _and_ yellow-eared, and secondly the Persian, the mule, the ass, the wild ass, the water-horse, _and_ others. 17. Of the camel _there are_ specially two, _that for_ the plain, _and_ the mountain _one which_ is double-humped. 18. Among the species of ox are the white, mud-coloured, red, yellow, black, and dappled, the elk, the buffalo, the camel-leopard [^24], the ox-fish, _and_ others. 19. Among sheep are those having tails and those which are tailless, also the wether and the Kûri<i>s</i>k _which_, because of its trampling the hills, _its_ great horn, and also being suitable <span id="p182"><sup><small>[ p. 182 ]</small></sup></span> for ambling, became the steed of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar. 20. Among goats are the ass-goat, the Arab, the fawn (varîkŏ), the roe, _and_ the mountain goat. 21. Among martens are the white ermine, the black marten, the squirrel, the beaver (khaz), and others. 22. Of musk _animals_ with a bag, one is the Bîsh-musk—which eats the Bîsh poison and does not die through it,—and it is created for the great advantage that it should eat the Bîsh, _and_ less _of it_ should succeed in poisoning the creatures—_and_ one is a musk _animal_ of a black colour which they desired (ayûftŏ) who were bitten _by_ the fanged serpent—as the serpent of the mountain water-courses (makŏ) is called—which is numerous on the river-banks; _one_ throws the same unto it for food, which it eats, _and_ then the serpent enters its body, when his [^25] serpent, at the time _this_ happens, feeds upon the same belly in which the serpent is, and he will become clear from that malady. 23. Among birds two were produced of a different character from the rest, and those are the griffon bird _and_ the bat, which have teeth _in_ the mouth, _and_ suckle _their_ young with animal milk from the teat.

24\. This is the fifth contest, as to animals.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (177:1) See Chaps. II, 6, III, 1, and Bund. IV, 1, X, 1, XIV, 1.

[^2]: (177:2) The MS. has ‘fifty-seven’ in ciphers, but Bund. X, 1, XIV, 1, XXVII, 2, have, ‘fifty-five’ in words.

[^3]: (177:3) This was the fourth nask or ‘book’ of the complete Mazdayasnian literature, according to the Dînka<i>r</i>d, which gives a very short and superficial account of its contents. But, according to the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkard and the Rivâyats of Kâmah Bahrah, Narîmân Hôshang, and Barzû Qiyâmu-d-dîn, it was the fifth nask, and was called Dvâzdah-hâmâst (or homâst). For its contents, as given by the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkard, see Haug‘s Essays, p. 127. The Rivâyat of Kâmah Bahrah, which has a few more words than the other Rivâyats, gives the following account (for the Persian text of which, see ’Fragmens relatifs à la religion de Zoroastre,' par Olshausen et Jules Mohl):—
  ‘Of the fifth the name is Dvâzdah-homâst, and the interpretation of this is “the book about help” (dar imdâd, but this is probably a corruption of dâmdâd). And this book has thirty-two sections (kardah) that the divine and omnipotent creator sent down, in remembrance of the beginning of the creatures of the superior world and inferior world, and _it is_ a description of the whole of them and of that which God, the most holy and omnipotent, mentioned about the sky, earth, and water, vegetation and p. 178 fire, man and quadrupeds, grazing and flying _animals_, and what he produced for their advantage and use, and the like. Secondly, the resurrection and _heavenly_ path, the gathering and dispersion, and the nature of the circumstances of the resurrection, as regards the virtuous and evil-doers, through the weight of every action they perform for good and evil.’
  This description corresponds very closely with what the Bundahi<i>s</i> must have been, before the addition of the genealogical and chronological chapters at the end; and Dâ<i>d</i>\-sparam mentions in his text here, and again in § 16, particulars regarding the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> which also occur in the Bundahi<i>s</i> (XIV, 2, 14-18, 21-24). There can be very little doubt, therefore, that the Bundahi<i>s</i> was originally a translation of the Dâmdâ<i>d</i>, though probably abridged; and the text translated in this volume is certainly a further abridgment of the original Bundahi<i>s</i>, or Zand-âkâs. Whether the Avesta text of the Dâmdâd was still in existence in the time of Dâ<i>d</i>\-sparam is uncertain, as he would apply the name to the Pahlavi text. At the present time it is very unusual for a copyist to write the Pahlavi text without its Avesta, when the latter exists, but this may not always have been the case.

[^4]: (178:1) Or ‘brains.’

[^5]: (178:2) Supposing the MS. galôlag is a corruption of gallak (Pers. ghallah).

[^6]: (178:3) Assuming the MS. alûhŏ or arvanŏ to be a corruption of alûm or ar<i>z</i>anŏ.

[^7]: (178:4) Reading râî instead of lâ.

[^8]: (178:5) Compare Bund. XIV, 2.

[^9]: (178:6) Either this sentence is very corrupt in the MS. or it cannot be p. 179 reconciled with the corresponding clause of Bund. XIV, 2. Altering dônak and gûnak into gandanak, and <i>s</i>amagâ into <i>s</i>ama<i>s</i>dar, we might read, ‘from the nose is mây<i>s</i>, which is called the leek, and the leek was an onion;’ but this is doubtful, and leaves the word mây<i>s</i> unexplained.

[^10]: (179:1) The MS. has gôspendânŏ, ‘cattle,’ instead of sipandânŏ, ‘rue, herbs.’

[^11]: (179:2) See Bund. I, 24, 27, XXVIII, 7, XXX, 29.

[^12]: (179:3) Bund. X, 2, XIV, 3.

[^13]: (179:4) Bund. X, 3, XIV, 4.

[^14]: (179:5) Bund. X, 3, XIV, 13.

[^15]: (180:1) Bund, XIV, 8-12.

[^16]: (180:2) Bund. XIV, I, 3-2 3, 26, 27.

[^17]: (180:3) Bund. XIV, 17 says, ‘fifteen,’ which is probably correct.

[^18]: (180:4) Only 181 species are detailed or ‘declared’ here.

[^19]: (181:1) Bund. XIV, 25.

[^20]: (181:2) See § 1; the particulars which follow are also found in Bund. XIV, 14-18, 21-24, showing that the Bundahi<i>s</i> must be derived from the Dâmdâ<i>d</i>.

[^21]: (181:3) The title of this work, in Pahlavi, is Tôkhm-au<i>s</i>mari<i>s</i>\-nîh-i hangar<i>d</i>îkŏ, but it is not known to be extant.

[^22]: (181:4) Reading marâk (Chaldee מָרֵא), but this is doubtful, though the Iranian final k is often added to Semitic Huzvâri<i>s</i> forms ending with â. It may be minâk, ‘thinking, thoughtful,’ or a corruption of manîk, ‘mine,’ in which last case we should translate, ‘this is a summary of mine.’

[^23]: (181:5) Bund. XXIV, 6.

[^24]: (181:6) Literally, ‘camel-ox-leopard.’

[^25]: (182:1) This appears to be the meaning here of amat zak gar<i>z</i>akŏ, but the whole sentence is a fair sample of Dâ<i>d</i>\-sparam's most involved style of writing. By feeding the black musk animal with snakes the effect of a snake-bite, experienced by the feeder, is supposed to be neutralized.
