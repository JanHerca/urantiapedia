## SHAYÂST LA-SHAYÂST. CHAPTER XIII.

0\. The signification of the Gâthas [^1].

1\. These three Ashem-vohûs (Yas. XI, end) which <span id="p353"><sup><small>[ p. 353 ]</small></sup></span> _represent_ [^2] the Fravarânê (Yas. XI, end) of the preliminary ritual (pê<i>s</i> nîrang) and the rotation of these three Hâs (‘chapters’), the Fravarânê, Frastuyê, and Âstuyê—fravarânê _being_ the beginning of the Fravarânê [^3] _which extends_ as far as frasastayaê<i>k</i>a [^4], frastuyê [^5], the beginning of the Frastuyê (Yas. XII, I-XIII, 26) _which extends_ up to the Âstuyê, and âstuyê [^6], the beginning of the Âstaothwanem [^7], (Yas. XIII, 27-XIV, end) _which extends_ as far as âstaothwanem<i>k</i>â daênay<i>a</i>u Mâzdayasnôi<i>s</i>—_also represent_ the Vîsâi-v<i>e</i>\-ameshâ-spe<i>n</i>tâ (Yas. XV), _which is_ the beginning of the Stôtânyasnô (‘the ritual of praisers’) [^8], and these three Hâs of the Baghãm (Yas. XIX-XXI).

2\. In the exposition (<i>k</i>ashî<i>d</i>ak) and through the <span id="p354"><sup><small>[ p. 354 ]</small></sup></span> evidence of revelation (dînô) the wise of those of the primitive faith [^9] _have_ thus said, that a man of fifteen years [^10], and a son and, brother of Mazdayasnians—when he confesses _his_ failings (mândak) to the high-priests (ra<i>d</i>ân), and they shall bring him the whip and scourge [^11], and these five Gâthas [^12] are chanted and the good waters consecrated by him, and the whole of the renewed-birth _ceremony_ (navî<i>d</i>\-zâ<i>d</i>îh) [^13] is performed by him—_becomes_ a mature youth and not a child, and a share of the prayers of initiation (nâpar) and of the fires is to be given over to him [^14]; and when thus much is not performed by him, a share is not to be given. 3. These five [^15] Gâthas are made up from the body of a righteous man.

<span id="p355"><sup><small>[ p. 355 ]</small></sup></span>

4\. Ahyâ-yâsâ (Yas. XXVIII), Khshmaibyâ (Yas. XXIX), and A<i>d</i>\-tâ-vakhshâ (Yas. XXX) _have_, severally, eleven stanzas (va<i>k</i>êst), because eleven things move spiritually within the bodies of men, as life, consciousness, religion, soul, guardian spirit, thought, word, deed, seeing, smelling, and hearing; and the bodies of men and other creatures are formed of water, fire, and wind [^16].

5\. Ashem-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XV) is _to be recited_ [^17] three times before the coming of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, and Sôshyans; and when they also recite the chapter (hâ<i>d</i>) well, and by line (gâs) and stanza, those _apostles_ are present [^18], and the <span id="p356"><sup><small>[ p. 356 ]</small></sup></span> country becomes more flourishing and more dominant in the world.

6\. The twenty-two stanzas of Tâ-v<i>e</i>\-urvâtâ (Yas. XXXI) are the twenty-two judgments (dâ<i>d</i>istân) of which it speaks in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht _Nask_ [^19] thus:—‘Anaomô mananghê daya vîspâi kva, kva parô?’ (where are _they_ to be produced beyond every thought? _and_ where before?‘) ’Lodging in the judge, that while _he has_ twenty-two judgments _he may be_ more just;'—so that when they pray the Tâ-v<i>e</i>\-urvâtâ chapter well, and recite _it_ by line and stanza, the judges possess those twenty-two judgments more correctly, and judiciousness is more lodging _in them_.

7\. The sixteen stanzas of the <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaithi _chapter_ (Yas. XXXII) [^20] are lodging in warriors, so that it becomes possible, during their good protection, to force the enemy _away_ from those sixteen countries which the Vendidad [^21] mentions in _its_ first fargar<i>d</i>.

<span id="p357"><sup><small>[ p. 357 ]</small></sup></span>

8\. The fourteen stanzas of Yathâ-âi<i>s</i> (Yas. XXXIII) are for this reason, because seven archangels are more diligent in activity _for_ the spirit, and seven archangels [^22] for the world, so that they may attain ‘to heaven, the home (mêhônŏ) of Aûharmazd, the home of the archangels, the home of those righteous ones,’ avi garô-nmânem, maêthanem Ahurahê mazd<i>a</i>u, maêthanem ameshanãm spe<i>n</i>tanãm, maêthanem anyaêshãm ashaonãm [^23]. 9. The three repetitions (dânar) of Y<i>e</i>\-s<i>e</i>vi<i>s</i>tô (Yas. XXXIII, 11) [^24], _and_ the holding up of the holy-water (zôhar) at these _repetitions_, are for the four classes [^25], and for this _reason_ at Ahurâi mazdâi _and_ ashem<i>k</i>â frâda<i>d</i> [^26] the holy-water is <span id="p358"><sup><small>[ p. 358 ]</small></sup></span> to be held level with the heart of him who is the officiating priest (zôt), and at sraotâ [^27] _it_ is to be held level with the arm of him who is the officiating priest, so that while the warriors are in battle with foreigners (anâîrân) they may be fuller of breath (vayô-gîrtar), and the husbandmen stronger-armed in the tillage and cultivation of the world.

10\. The fifteen stanzas of Yâ-<i>s</i>kyaothanâ (Yas. XXXIV) are for this reason, because it is given [^28] for the destruction of those fifteen fiends who are disclosed in the medical part (bêshâ<i>z</i>) of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht _Nask_ [^29]. 11. The four repetitions (bâr) of Mazdâ-a<i>d</i>\-môi (Yas. XXXIV, 15) [^30] are for the right coming on of the share of these five chieftainships (ra<i>d</i>îh), the house-ruler, the village-ruler, the tribe-ruler, the province-ruler, and the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^31].

12\. The two repetitions of Ahyâ-yâsâ (Yas. XVIII, 1) [^32], are for this reason, that the sovereign (dahyûpat) may not at once seize body, consciousness, <span id="p359"><sup><small>[ p. 359 ]</small></sup></span> and soul. 13. Those four Yathâ-ahû-vairyôs of the first _Gâtha_ [^33] are for this reason, that is, so that inferiors may become more tolerant of the commands of superiors, and good thoughts, good words, and good deeds be more domesticated (mâhmântar) in the world, and the fiend more powerless (apâ<i>d</i>akhshâhtar).

14\. In short (aê-mar) [^34], Ahyâ-yâsâ is as (pavan) [^35] Aûharmazd and the righteous man, Khshmaibyâ as Vohûman and cattle, A<i>d</i>\-tâ-vakhshyâ as Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t and fire, Tâ-v<i>e</i>\-urvâtâ as Shatvaîrô [^36] and metal, the <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaithi as the Gâtha of Spendarma<i>d</i> and the earth, Yatha-âi<i>s</i> as Horvada<i>d</i> and water, and Yâ-<i>s</i>kyaothanâ as Amerôda<i>d</i> and plants.

15\. The progress which is in [^37] the Ahunavaiti Gâtha the house-rulers should carry on; that which is in the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha the village-rulers should carry on; that which is in the Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû [^38] Gâtha the tribe-rulers should carry on; that which is in the Vohû-khshathra Gâtha the province-rulers should carry on; that which is in the Vahi<i>s</i>tô-i<i>s</i>ti Gathâ the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>ts should carry on, and <span id="p360"><sup><small>[ p. 360 ]</small></sup></span> that which is in the Yasna, which is the place of righteous blessing [^39], these four classes themselves should carry on.

16\. Of the Yasna _of seven chapters_ (Yas. XXXV-XLI, 17) the beginning section (kar<i>d</i>akŏ) _has_ nine stanzas; and its beginning [^40] is Humatanãm (Yas. XXXV, 4), and its end is Humatanãm (Yas. XLI, 17 supl.)

17\. The six stanzas of Ahyâ-thwâ-âthrô (Yas, XXXVI) are owing to the six hot ordeals (var) which, in the Hûspâram _Nask_ [^41], are effected by <i>k</i>athrayâim âthraiãm [^42].

18\. The five stanzas of Ithâ-â<i>d</i>\-yazamaidê (Yas. XXXVII) are thanksgiving and praise for the production of the good creations by Aûharmazd.

19\. The five stanzas of Imãm-âa<i>d</i>\-zãm (Yas. XXXVIII) are owing to those five comforts and five discomforts of the earth, which, it is declared in the third fargar<i>d</i> in the Vendidad [^43] are accomplished <span id="p361"><sup><small>[ p. 361 ]</small></sup></span> thus:—‘The first comfort of the earth is from the land on which a righteous man walks forth; the second is when they shall make the dwelling of the good and fires upon it; the third is when they sow corn upon it, and shall take heed of dead matter; the fourth is when all beasts _of burden_ are born upon it; the fifth is when every beast _of burden_ is on it [^44]; and its first discomfort is from the Arezûr ridge [^45] and the gate of hell; the second is when they dig [^46] it up _for_ a dead _body_; the third is when _one_ constructs a depository _for the dead_ (khazân) [^47] upon it; the fourth is from the holes of its noxious creatures; the fifth is when they shall forsake a man in affliction (var<i>d</i>akîh) upon it, who is righteous.’

20\. The five stanzas of Ithâ (Yas. XXXIX) are just as those which _go_ before.

21\. The four stanzas of Âhû-a<i>d</i>\-paiti (Yas. XL) are about the benefit (ar<i>g</i>\-hômandîh) which is on account of water, earth, plants, and animals.

22\. The six stanzas of Stûtô-garô (Yas. XLI, 117), the two repetitions of Humatanãm (Yas. XX XV, 4-6), _and_ the three repetitions of Hukhshathrôtemâi (Yas. XXXV, 13-15) are on account of the existence of the sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^48].

<span id="p362"><sup><small>[ p. 362 ]</small></sup></span>

23\. The two repetitions of Ashahyâ-âa<i>d</i>\-sairi [^49] (Yas. XXXV, 22, 23) are for the laudation of righteousness and the destruction of the fiend. 24. The two repetitions of YêNhê-hâtãm [^50] are for the laudation of Aûharmazd and the archangels, and the destruction of the evil spirit and the miscreations (vishû<i>d</i>akân). 25. _The two repetitions of_ [^51] Thwôistaotaras<i>k</i>â, (Yas. XLI, 12-14) are for the laudation of ceremonial worship (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) and the _sacred_ feast (mâzd).

26\. The two repetitions of Âtarem<i>k</i>a (Visp. XIX, 1-8) [^52] are for the laudation of the Frôbâk fire and the fire Vâzi<i>s</i>t [^53].

27\. Of the sixteen stanzas of the U<i>s</i>tavaiti _chapter_ (Yas. XLII) [^54] it is related just as about the <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaithi _chapter_ [^55].

<span id="p363"><sup><small>[ p. 363 ]</small></sup></span>

28\. The twenty stanzas of Ta<i>d</i>\-thwâ-peresâ (Yas. XLIII) are the twenty judgments (dâ<i>d</i>istân) between the beneficent spirit and the evil spirit; and for this _reason_ they should every time utter Ta<i>d</i>\-thwâ-peresâ again [^56], because they should utter the original judgment again, and the twentieth time the evil spirit becomes confounded.

29\. The eleven stanzas of A<i>d</i>\-fravakhshyâ (Yas. XLIV) are made up from the six chieftainships [^57] and the five accomplishments (farhâng) owing to religion; one is thus, not to do unto others [^58] all that which is not well for one‘s self; the second is to understand fully _what_ is well-done and not-well-done; the third is to turn from the vile and their conversation (andarag-gûftanŏ); the fourth is to confess _one’s_ failings to the high-priests, and let them bring the whip; the fifth is not to neglect the season-festivals at _their proper_ hour (dên hâsar), _nor_ the other things which go to the bridge [^59]; and the six chieftainships are not his property who has not these <span id="p364"><sup><small>[ p. 364 ]</small></sup></span> five accomplishments, and he is not fit even for teaching.

30\. The nineteen stanzas of Kãm-nemôi-zãm (Yas. XLV) are for this reason, that every one may so persevere in his own duty (khve<i>s</i>akânîh) [^60], that while those are our nineteen propitiations (aû<i>s</i>ôfrî<i>d</i>) [^61], which it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm _Nask_ [^62] should be my own, the strength and power of the angels shall become more considerable, and the destroyer more perishable.

31\. The U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha is a Gâtha (gâs) of four chapters [^63], and each stanza of five lines (gâs), except Hê<i>k</i>a<i>d</i>\-aspâ-vakhshyâ (Yas. XLV, 15) [^64]. 32. The two repetitions of U<i>s</i>tâ-ahmâi (Yas. XLII, 1) [^65] are, one _as_ a retention _and_ embrace of Aûharmazd, and one _as_ a destruction of the fiends; _and_ U<i>s</i>ta-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XXI, 1-5) [^66] _in_ like manner.

33\. Spe<i>n</i>ta-mainyû (Yas. XLVI) _has_ six stanzas, Yêzî-adâi<i>s</i> (Yas. XLVII) twelve stanzas, A<i>d</i>\-mâ-yavâ (Yas. XLVIII) twelve stanzas, _and_ Ka<i>d</i>\-môi-urvâ (Yas. XLIX) eleven stanzas. 34. The Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû Gâtha is a Gâtha of four chapters [^67], and <span id="p365"><sup><small>[ p. 365 ]</small></sup></span> each stanza of four lines; it is made up from the five chieftainships and four classes [^68]. 35. The two repetitions of Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû (Yas. XLVI, 1) [^69] are, one _for_ the laudation of the beneficent spirit (spendamat), and one for that of the earth [^70].

36\. One Spe<i>n</i>tem-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XXII, 1-11) [^71] is the laudation of the creatures of the beneficent spirit, and one is the destruction of the creatures of the evil spirit.

37\. The twenty-two stanzas of the Vohû-khshathra Gâtha (Yas. L) are those twenty-two judgments which are lodging within judges, as written above [^72]. 38. The two repetitions of Vohû-khshathrem (Yas. L, 1) [^73] are, one the laudation of living (zîndakîh), and one of the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

39\. One Vohû-khshathrem yazamaidê (Visp. XXIII, 1-9) [^74] is for the laudation of Shatvaîrô [^75], and one of metal. 40. The two repetitions of <span id="p366"><sup><small>[ p. 366 ]</small></sup></span> Avi-apâm (Visp. XXIV, 1-12) [^76] are, one for the laudation of waters, and one of plants.

41\. The nine stanzas of the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti (Yas. LII) are on account of those nine things which are [^77] . . . the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>tship lodging in the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>ts, the source of fountains, the bridge _over_ waters, and even the navigable river, the righteous man, and the righteous woman. 42. And _it is_ a Gâtha of one chapter, _and_ each stanza of four lines, except Ithâ-î-haithyâ-narô (Yas. LII, 6) [^78], for _there_ is always one lord and sovereign in the world. 43. And those four lines are for this _reason_, because _it_ is declared: <i>k</i>athru<i>s</i> hamay<i>a</i>u khshapô dahmayâ<i>d</i> parô âfritôi<i>d</i> [^79], ‘four times every night is the “blessing of the holy” (Yas. LIX),’ and three _times_ Srôsh [^80], twice Bûshâsp [^81], and once Aêshm [^82] will come <span id="p367"><sup><small>[ p. 367 ]</small></sup></span> to the material world. 44. And the five _lines_ of that one _stanza_ (Yas. LII, 6) are for this _reason_, because the assistants of the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t are five, the house-ruler, the village-ruler, the tribe-ruler, the province-ruler, and she even who is his own wife (nârîk) [^83]. 45. The two repetitions of Vahi<i>s</i>tâ-î<i>s</i>tis (Yas. LII, 1) [^84] are, one _for_ the laudation of sovereigns, and one for the laudation of peace (pa<i>d</i>mân).

46\. The two repetitions of Vahi<i>s</i>tem-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XXVI) [^85] are, one _for_ the laudation of Aûharmazd and the archangels, and one for the destruction of the fiends. 47. The four repetitions of the Airyamana (Yas. LIII) [^86] are for the existence of more submission (aîrmânîh) in the house, village, tribe, and province. 48. The four repetitions of Ava<i>d</i>\-mi<i>z</i>dem (Visp. XXVII) are for the healing of those [^87] _who_ dwell in the house, village, tribe, and province.

49\. The section (kar<i>d</i>akŏ) whose beginning is Ta<i>d</i>\-sôidhi<i>s</i> (Yas. LVII, 1-9) [^88] is, for the completion <span id="p368"><sup><small>[ p. 368 ]</small></sup></span> of the Gâthas, taught as _pertaining_, to the Gâthas (gâsânîk <i>k</i>â<i>s</i>t).

50\. The beginning of the Gâthas is Ahyâ-yâsâ (Yas. XXVIII, 1), and their end is drigavê vahyô (Yas. LII, 9, end); and _there_ are 278 stanzas, 1016 lines, 5567 words (vâ<i>k</i>ak), 9999 mârîk, and 16,554 khûr<i>d</i>ak [^89]. 51. For the lines and stanzas of the Gâthas _were_ collected by us, and were:—one hundred stanzas of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha (Yas. XXVIII-XXXIV), of which each stanza is three lines; forty stanzas of the Yasna _of seven chapters_ (Yas. XXXV-XLI, 17), <span id="p369"><sup><small>[ p. 369 ]</small></sup></span> of which each stanza is three lines; sixty-six stanzas of the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha (Yas. XLII-XLV), of which each stanza is five lines, except Haê<i>k</i>a<i>d</i>\-aspâ (Yas. XLV, 15), for that one is four lines; forty-one stanzas of the Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû Gâtha (Yas. XLVI-XLIX), of which each stanza is four lines; twenty-two stanzas of the Vohû-khshathra (Yas. L), of which each stanza is three [^90] lines; _and_ nine stanzas of the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti (Yas. LII), of which each stanza is four lines, except Ithâ-î (Yas. LII, 6), for that one is a stanza of five;—the amount of the foregoing [^91] is 278 stanzas [^92].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (352:9) That is, the mystical meaning or influence supposed to attach to various parts of the ancient hymns, or to the manner in which they are chanted. The term Gâtha or ‘hymn’ (Pahl. gâs) is applied, in this chapter, not only to the five Gâthas properly so called, but also to the Yasna of seven chapters, and apparently to p. 353 other portions of the Yasna written in the Gâtha dialect of the Avesta.

[^2]: (353:1) This appears to be the meaning, but the construction of this section is altogether very obscure, and the text is more or less corrupt in all MSS. In the celebration of the Yasna or Ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n the officiating priest tastes the Hôm juice during the recitation of Yas. XI (see Haug's Essays, p. 404), and shortly afterwards he commences the preliminary prayers mentioned in the text.

[^3]: (353:2) Both K20 and M6 have Frerân in Pâzand.

[^4]: (353:3) Both K20 and M6 omit the initial f.

[^5]: (353:4) M6 has âstuyê.

[^6]: (353:5) M6 omits this word.

[^7]: (353:6) This is the Avesta name of the Hâ or chapter consisting of Yas. XIII, 27-XIV, 19; as Fraoreti is the name of the preceding Hâ, consisting of Yas. XII, I-XIII, 26.

[^8]: (353:7) Probably consisting of the three Hâs, Yas. XV-XVII; in which case, the meaning seems to be that the three Ashem-vohûs, at the beginning of this preliminary ritual, are symbolical of each of the three triplets of chapters which follow them; first, of the Fravarânê, Fraoreti, and Âstaothwanem chapters; secondly, of the three chapters of the Stôtân-yasnô; and thirdly, of those of the Baghân Ya<i>s</i>t.

[^9]: (354:1) See Chap. I, 3.

[^10]: (354:2) Referring to one about to become a priest.

[^11]: (354:3) The Av. a<i>s</i>tra and sraoshô-<i>k</i>arana of Vend. IV, 38-114, &c., which were formerly used for the temporal punishment of sinners. Whether they are here brought to the neophyte as a token of his admission to the priesthood, or are administered to him as a punishment for his offences, is not quite clear.

[^12]: (354:4) The five Gâthas are the Ahunavaiti (Yas. XXVIII-XXXIV), the U<i>s</i>tavaiti (Yas. XLII-XLV), the Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû (Yas. XLVI-XLIX), the Vohû-khshathra (Yas. L), and the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti (Yas. LII); these collections of hymns are thus named from the words with which each of them commences, excepting the first, which derives its name from the Ahunavar (see Bund. I, 21) which is written in the same metre.

[^13]: (354:5) This is the Pahlavi form of the Parsi navazûdi, a term applied to the whole initiatory ceremonial of a nônâbar, or newly initiated priest; the term evidently implies that the ceremony is considered somewhat in the light of ‘regeneration.’

[^14]: (354:6) That is, he can take his part in the regular priestly duties, including the initiation of other neophytes.

[^15]: (354:7) Both K20 and M6 have four in ciphers, which can hardly be right; the sentence is clear enough, but the idea of its writer is rather obscure.

[^16]: (355:1) These first three chapters of the Ahunavaiti collection of hymns are here supposed to symbolize the three material elements, whose union distinguishes a man's body from inorganic substances; while the eleven stanzas, which each of these chapters contains, symbolize the eleven immaterial existences said to be contained in the same body.

[^17]: (355:2) This is doubtful, as no verb is expressed, and, the word bâr, ‘time,’ is struck out in M6, so it is possible to read ‘the “three foremost” of the Ashem-Ahurem-mazdãm are the coming of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar,’ &c. The ‘three foremost’ (3 levînŏg) would be a possible Pahlavi translation of the Av. ti<i>s</i>rô paoiryô and ti<i>s</i>ra paoirya of Visp. XV, 4-6, instead of the actual ‘three first’ (3-i fratûm), as may be seen from Pahl. Visp. VIII, 17, 20, where both pê<i>s</i> (= levînŏ) and fratûm are used indifferently for Av. paoiryô. At any rate the idea embodied in the text is that these ‘three first’ have some reference to the three future apostles of the Parsi religion (see Bund. XXXII, 8, B. Yt. III, 13, 44, 52, 62). In fact, however, they seem to refer to the first three chapters of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha, immediately after which this chapter (Visp. XV) is recited in the full Parsi ritual; the phrase being rendered in the Pahlavi translation thus:—‘I reverence the three first by not speaking out, that is, I do not say anything during them, and not wearing out, that is, I do not doze away during them.’

[^18]: (355:3) K20 has ‘arrive early.’

[^19]: (356:1) See B. Yt. III, 25. Both the Avesta text here quoted and the translation suggested must be received with caution, as the MSS. do not agree in the three central words; K20 has manaNhê de vîspâi kaua, and M6 has manaNhê kya vîsâi kaia. The former reading has been adopted, with very slight correction, as it seems the more intelligible; but the meaning of the preceding word, anaomô, is, far from certain. The writer seems to have been quoting from a Pahlavi version of the Nask which contained this Avesta quotation.

[^20]: (356:2) This Hâ, which begins with the words a<i>h</i><i>v</i>yâ<i>k</i>â <i>h</i><i>v</i>aêtu<i>s</i>, is not called by its initial words, as the preceding chapters are, but has this special name (see the prayers at the end of it) derived from its second word, and which is corrupted in Pahlavi into Khvêtmanŏ.

[^21]: (356:3) Here written Gavî<i>d</i>\-<i>s</i>êdâ-dâ<i>d</i> as in Sls. Part I, and not Vadîkdâ<i>d</i> as in other parts of Sls. Part II (see § 19 and Chap. XII, 4, 6, 20, 23, 26). Vend. I contains an account of the sixteen p. 357 ‘best of regions and countries’ where the Iranian power and religion extended at an early date.

[^22]: (357:1) The seven archangels besides their spiritual duties have severally charge of the seven worldly existences, man, animals, fire, metal, earth, water, and plants (see § 14 and Chap. XV). But perhaps we should read ‘angels,’ as they are often mentioned as ‘the angels of the spiritual and worldly existences.’

[^23]: (357:2) This quotation, of which the Pahlavi translation is first given, and then the Avesta text, is from Vend. XIX, 107.

[^24]: (357:3) This stanza is recited thrice, and about the same time the officiating priest strains the Hôm juice, and prepares to pour holy-water into the mortar in which the Hôm twigs were pounded (see Haug's Essays, pp. 402, 406).

[^25]: (357:4) Or ‘professions’ of the community, of which there were originally only three, the priest, warrior, and husbandman; but at a later date the artizan was added. Both K20 and M6 have ‘four classes,’ but this is inconsistent with the ‘three repetitions.’ The Avesta generally knows only three classes, but four are mentioned in the Baghân Ya<i>s</i>t (Yas. XIX, 46).

[^26]: (357:5) That is, probably, at the words Ahurô mazd<i>a</i>us<i>k</i>â in the first line, and ashem<i>k</i>â frâda<i>d</i> in the second line of the stanza; but this is doubtful, as the MSS. give the words corruptly, in a mixture of Av. and Pahl., as follows: pavan Ahurâi mazdâi ahârayih-i da<i>d</i>ŏîh.

[^27]: (358:1) The first word in the third line of the stanza; but this, again, has to be guessed from a Pahlavi version in the MSS. which may be read va vâ-srôdâân.

[^28]: (358:2) Or ‘produced.’

[^29]: (358:3) In the last division of that Nask (see B. Yt. III, 25, note).

[^30]: (358:4) This last stanza of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha is recited four times.

[^31]: (358:5) See Yas. XIX, 50-52. The last of these rulers must have been the supreme pontiff or patriarch of the province, and in the province of Ragha (Rages or Raî, near Teheran) he was both temporal and spiritual ruler.

[^32]: (358:6) This first stanza of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha is recited twice, not only in its proper place (as the first stanza of each chapter is, in the Gâthas), but also at the end of every chapter of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha, while the officiating priest sprinkles the sacred twigs with the sacred milk or gâu<i>s</i> <i>g</i>îvya, ‘living-cow produce’ (see Haug's Essays, pp. 405, 406).

[^33]: (359:1) After the two Ahyâ-yâsâs, at the end of each chapter of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha, the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô formula (see Bund. I, 21) is recited four times.

[^34]: (359:2) Or ‘to sum up.’

[^35]: (359:3) It is not quite clear how pavan, ‘in, on, with, by, through, as, for,’ &c., should be translated in each clause of this section; but the intention is evidently to compare the seven chapters of the Ahunavaiti Gathâ with the seven archangels and the seven earthly creations which they severally protect (see Chap. XV).

[^36]: (359:4) Here written Shatrîvar.

[^37]: (359:5) Meaning probably ‘the prosperity which is _occasioned_ by;’ but the exact signification of the word frâk-shâm or freh-kashâm (or however it may be read) is uncertain.

[^38]: (359:6) Spendômat or Spendamat in Pahlavi.

[^39]: (360:1) That is, the Yasna of seven chapters (Yas. XXXV-XLI), which is called simply ‘the Yasna’ in this chapter. This last clause, which is omitted in M6, connects these later hymns with the four classes of the community (see § 9), just as the five older hymns are connected with the five chiefs of the community (see § 11) in the former clauses. This section may be a translation from the Avesta, as the verbs precede their nominatives.

[^40]: (360:2) That is, the beginning of the Yasna of seven chapters.

[^41]: (360:3) See Chap. X, 21; but the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm Nask (see Chap. X, 25) is probably meant, as it contained a section on ordeals by heat and cold.

[^42]: (360:4) These Avesta words are evidently corrupt, but perhaps ‘a quadruple fire’ is meant. K20 has <i>k</i>athrâyâim âthraiãm.

[^43]: (360:5) Here written Vandîkdâ<i>d</i> (see § 7). The passage here cited is not a quotation, but only a brief summary of Vend. III, 1-37; and appears to have been derived direct from the Avesta, without the assistance of the Pahlavi version, as several words differ from that translation.

[^44]: (361:1) The verb is probably omitted by mistake, and we ought to read ‘voids urine upon it,’ in accordance with Vend. III, 20.

[^45]: (361:2) See Bund. XII, 8.

[^46]: (361:3) Reading kalêndend (Pers. kalandand), as Vend. III, 27 refers to burial of the dead, and the same idea might be obtained, more fancifully, by reading kilînênd, ‘they turn to clay’ (compare Pers. gil, ‘clay’); but the most obvious reading is karînênd, ‘they cut,’ and as the sentence stands it would imply that ‘they cut up its dead.’

[^47]: (361:4) See Chap. II, 6.

[^48]: (361:5) The three apostles expected in the future (see § 5 and Bund. XXXII, 8). It is doubtful whether these three passages in the p. 362 Yasna are here intended all to refer to the same subject, but no other subject is mentioned for the two former. Having completed the enumeration of the sections of the Yasna of seven chapters, the writer is now proceeding to notice those passages which are recited more than once in the performance of the ritual.

[^49]: (362:1) M6 has gairî, ‘in a song,’ with the obsolete g, which is very like s, and is also used in the word garô in § 22; this is a variant well worth consideration by translators of the Avesta. K20 has only Ashahyâ.

[^50]: (362:2) This formula (see B. Yt. II, 64) is recited after every chapter of the Gâthas, but does not appear to be anywhere recited twice; so the words 2 dânar, ‘two repetitions,’ may perhaps be inserted here in the wrong place, as they are wanting in § 25.

[^51]: (362:3) These words are omitted in the Pahlavi text, evidently through mistake.

[^52]: (362:4) Visp. XIX, XX follow Yas. XLI in the full Parsi ritual, and the first of them is recited twice.

[^53]: (362:5) The Frôbâk is the oldest sacred fire on earth, and the Vâzi<i>s</i>t is the lightning. (see Bund. XVII, 1, 5, SZS. XI, 5, 8-10).

[^54]: (362:6) The first chapter of the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha (see § 2, note 4), so called from its first word u<i>s</i>tâ.

[^55]: (362:7) See § 7.

[^56]: (363:1) That is, the first line (ta<i>d</i> thwâ peresâ ere<i>s</i> môi vao<i>k</i>â Ahurâ! ‘that I shall ask thee, tell _it_ me right, O Ahura!’) is repeated at the beginning of each of the first nineteen stanzas, and the first stanza being recited twice (as in all chapters of the Gâthas) these words are recited twenty times before the last stanza is reached. The phrases ‘and for this _reason_’ and ‘because they should utter the original judgment again’ are omitted in M6.

[^57]: (363:2) These cannot be the same ‘chieftainships’ (ra<i>d</i>îh) as those mentioned in § 11, of which there are only five; but perhaps they are the spiritual chieftainships, or primacies, of the six other regions of the earth (see Bund. XXIX, 1).

[^58]: (363:3) Assuming that aî<i>s</i>an stands for aî<i>s</i>ân.

[^59]: (363:4) The <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, or route of the soul to the other world (see Chap. XII, 31). Part of these fourth and fifth clauses is omitted in K20 by mistake.

[^60]: (364:1) Or, it may be, ‘through his own intellect (khvê<i>s</i>ak hûsh),’ or merely another mode of writing khvê<i>s</i>kârîh, ‘industry.’

[^61]: (364:2) Considering each of the stanzas as an offering to, or propitiation of, (Av. usefriti) the angels.

[^62]: (364:3) See Chap. X, 25.

[^63]: (364:4) Those detailed in §§ 27-30.

[^64]: (364:5) Which stanza has only four lines. Pahl. gâs means both the whole hymn and also each line of the hymn.

[^65]: (364:6) The first stanza of the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha, which is recited twice, both in its proper place and at the end of each chapter of that Gâtha (see § 12, note).

[^66]: (364:7) Visp. XXI follows Yas. XLV in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice.

[^67]: (364:8) Those detailed in § 33.

[^68]: (365:1) See §§ 9, 11.

[^69]: (365:2) The first stanza of the Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû Gâtha, which is recited twice, both in its proper place and at the end of each chapter of that Gâtha (see § 12, note).

[^70]: (365:3) It seems probable that the Pahlavi writer has here confounded Spendamat, ‘the beneficent spirit,’ with the archangel Spendarma<i>d</i> who has special charge of the earth; their names being even more alike in Pahlavi than in English, though corrupted from the distinct Avesta forms spe<i>n</i>ta mainyu and spe<i>n</i>ta ârmaiti, respectively.

[^71]: (365:4) Visp. XXII follows Yas. XLIX in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice.

[^72]: (365:5) See § 6.

[^73]: (365:6) The first stanza of the Vohû-khshathra Gâtha, which is recited twice, both at the beginning and end of the chapter (see § 12, note).

[^74]: (365:7) Visp. XXIII, 1-9 follows Yas. L in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice.

[^75]: (365:8) The archangel who has special charge of metal (see § 14, Chap. XV, 5, 14-19, and Bund. I, 26, XXX, 19); the name is here written Shatrîvar.

[^76]: (366:1) After the two recitations of Visp. XXIII, 1-9 there follow Vend. XV, XVI, and Visp. XXIII, 10, and then Visp. XXIV, 1-12 is recited twice, in the full Parsi ritual, followed by Visp. XXV.

[^77]: (366:2) Some words are evidently lost here; M6 has m followed by a blank space, and K20 has madam, ‘on.’ It is not quite certain whether the things mentioned are to be reckoned as four, five, or six; but assuming they are five, it is possible that the four things missing in the text are the four remaining chieftainships (see § 11), the rulerships of the house, village, tribe, and province lodged in the rulers of the same respectively.

[^78]: (366:3) Which stanza has five lines, and is, therefore, here considered symbolical of the ruling monarch, or pontiff.

[^79]: (366:4) This Avesta passage does not appear to be extant elsewhere, and its Pahlavi translation, given in the text, is not quite correct it would be better thus: ‘through the “blessing of the holy” four times every night;’ dahma âfriti (Pahl. dâhmân âfrînô, ‘blessing of the holy’) is the technical name of Yas. LIX.

[^80]: (366:5) See Bund. XIX, 33, XXX, 29. This angel, invoked by the ‘blessing’ (Yas. LIX, 8), comes to defend mankind against the wiles of Bûshâsp and Aêshm.

[^81]: (366:6) The demoness of sloth (see Bund. XXVIII, 26).

[^82]: (366:7) The demon of wrath (see Bund. XXVIII, 15-17, 20).

[^83]: (367:1) Though bound to be strictly obedient to her husband or guardian, a Mazdayasnian woman occupied a more honourable position in the community than was sanctioned by any other oriental religion.

[^84]: (367:2) The first stanza of the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti Gâtha, which is recited twice, both at the beginning and end of the chapter (see § 12, note).

[^85]: (367:3) Visp. XXVI follows Yas. LII in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice, followed by Vend. XIX, XX.

[^86]: (367:4) So called from its first words â airy<i>e</i>mâ; it is recited four times after Vend. XX, and shortly afterwards Visp. XXVII is also recited four times, as mentioned in § 48.

[^87]: (367:5) M6 has ‘of the soul,’ which is, no doubt, a blunder due to the illegibility of the MS. from which it was copied.

[^88]: (367:6) This is the Fshûshô-mãthra (‘a spell or prayer for prosperity.’) Of Visp. I, 28, II, 30, Yas. LVI, ix, 6, LVIII, 13. Whether the remainder of Yas. LVII is to be considered as pertaining to the Gâthas is uncertain; it is recited in seven sections by the assistant priest, each section from a different position; these seven positions being the stations of the seven assistant priests who are supposed to be present spiritually, and to be arranged three on each side, and one at the south end, of the ceremonial area, while the chief officiating priest occupies the north end (see Haug's Essays, p. 332).

[^89]: (368:1) The numbers of the stanzas and lines are correct, as may be seen from the details given in § 51. Regarding the words there is the uncertainty as to what constitutes a compound word, but, taking each compound in Westergaard‘s edition of the texts as a single word, the total number of words in the 1016 lines is about 6147; and this could be reduced to 5567 only by omitting the Yasna of seven chapters, and somewhat relaxing the rule as to compound words. The meaning of the last two terms, mârik and khûr<i>d</i>ak, is doubtful, but they are certainly not syllables and letters, as the number of syllables exceeds 13,000. In other places (see Bund. I, 21) mârik usually means ’a word,‘ but that meaning is expressed by the term vâ<i>k</i>ak here. If the number 9999 be correct, mârîk must signify some particular class of syllable which would include about three-fourths of the whole number of syllables. It may be noted, however, that Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, in the particulars he gives about the Gâthas (see SZS. XI, 10, note 6), states the number of mârîk at 6666. The khûr<i>d</i>ak or ’small' things are probably the consonants.

[^90]: (369:1) All MSS. have ‘four,’ and then add the exception about Ithâ-i to the account of this Gâtha, instead of mentioning it in the details of the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti; which blunder is here corrected.

[^91]: (369:2) Reading kadmon yehevûni<i>s</i>nŏ, but the latter word, with part of the ciphers which follow, is torn away in K20, and in M6 it is written so as to resemble the Avesta letters gnn gnn, which are unintelligible, though something like Pahl. yehevûni<i>s</i>nŏ; there can, however, be little doubt as to the general meaning of the phrase.

[^92]: (369:3) The number of lines is easily computed from the same details, as follows:—300 + 120 + 329 + 164 + 66 + 37 = 1016 lines, as stated in § 50, and as they still exist in the Gâtha texts.
