## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XII.

1\. On the nature of mountains it says in revelation, that, at first, the mountains have grown forth in eighteen years; and Albûr<i>z</i> ever grew, till the completion of eight hundred years; two hundred years _up_ to the star station (pâyak), two hundred years to the moon station, two hundred years to the sun station, and two hundred years to the endless light [^1]. 2. While the other mountains have grown out of Albûr<i>z</i>, in number 2244 mountains, _and_ are Hûgar the lofty [^2], Têrak of Albûr<i>z</i>, <i>K</i>akâ<i>d</i>\-i-Dâîtîk, and the Are<i>z</i>ûr ridge, the Aûsîndôm mountain, Mount Apârsên which they say is the mountain of Pârs, Mount Zari<i>d</i> also which is Mount Mânû<i>s</i>, Mount Aîra<i>k</i>, Mount Kaf, Mount Vâ<i>d</i>gês, Mount Aûshdâ<i>s</i>târ, Mount Are<i>z</i>ûr-bûm, Mount Rôyi<i>s</i>n-hômand, Mount Padashkhvârgar which is the greatest in Khvârîh, the mountain which they call <i>K</i>înŏ, Mount Rêvand, Mount Dârspêt the Bakyir mountain, Mount Kabed-<i>s</i>ikaft, Mount Sîyâk-mûî-mand, Mount Vafar-hômand, Mount Spendyâ<i>d</i> _and_ Kôndrâsp, Mount Asnavand _and_ Kôndras, Mount <span id="p35"><sup><small>[ p. 35 ]</small></sup></span> Si<i>k</i>idâv [^3], a mountain among which are in Kangde<i>z</i> [^4], _of_ which they say that they are a comfort and delight of the good creator, the smaller hills.

3\. I _will_ mention them also a second time; Albûr<i>z</i> [^5] is around this earth and is connected with the sky. 4. The Têrak [^6] of Albûr<i>z</i> is that through which the stars, moon, _and_ sun pass [^7] in, and through it they come back. 5. Hûgar the lofty [^8] is that from which the water of Arêdvîvsûr [^9] leaps down the height of a thousand men. 6. The Aûsîndôm [^10] mountain is that which, being of ruby <span id="p36"><sup><small>[ p. 36 ]</small></sup></span> (khûn-âhinŏ), of the substance of the sky [^11], is _in_ the midst of the wide-formed ocean, so that its water, which is from Hûgar, pours down into it (the ocean). 7. <i>K</i>akâ<i>d</i>\-i-Dâîtîk (‘the judicial peak’) is that of the middle of the world, the height of a hundred men, on which the <i>K</i>învar bridge [^12] stands; and they take account of the soul at that place. 8. The Are<i>z</i>ûr [^13] ridge \[of the Albûr<i>z</i> mountain\] is a summit at the gate of hell, where they always hold the concourse of the demons. 9. This also is said, that, excepting Albûr<i>z</i>, the Apârsên [^14] mountain is the <span id="p37"><sup><small>[ p. 37 ]</small></sup></span> greatest; the Apârsên mountain they call the mountain of Pars, and its beginning is in Sagastân [^15] and its end in Khû<i>g</i>îstân. 10. Mount Mânû<i>s</i> [^16] is great; the mountain on which Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar was born.

11\. The remaining mountains have chiefly grown from those; as it is said that the elevation (afsârîh) of the districts had arisen most around those three mountains [^17]. 12. Mount Aîra<i>k</i> [^18] is in the middle from Hama<i>d</i>ân to Khvâri<i>z</i>em, and has grown from Mount Apârsên. 13. Mount \[<i>K</i>înŏ\] [^19], which is on its east, on the frontier of Tûrkistân, is connected also with Apârsên. 14. Mount Kaf [^20] has grown from the same Mount Apârsên. 15. Mount <span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span> Aûshdâ<i>s</i>târ [^21] is in Sagastân. 16. Mount Are<i>z</i>ûr [^22] is that which is in the direction of Arûm. 17. The Padashkhvârgar [^23] mountain is that which is in Taparîstân and the side of Gîlân. 18. The Rêvand [^24] mountain is in Khûrâsân [^25], on which the Bûr<i>z</i>în fire [^26] was established; and its _name_ Rêvand _means_ this, that _it_ is glorious. 19. The Vâ<i>d</i>gês [^27] mountain is that which is on the frontier of the Vâ<i>d</i>gêsians; that quarter is full of timber _and_ full of trees. 20. The Bakyîr [^28] mountain is that which Frâsiyâ<i>v</i> of Tûr used as a stronghold, and he made his residence within _it_; and _in_ the days of Yim [^29] a myriad towns and cities were erected on its pleasant _and_ prosperous territory. 21. Mount Kabed-<i>s</i>ikaft [^30] (‘very rugged’) <span id="p39"><sup><small>[ p. 39 ]</small></sup></span> is that in Pârs, out of the same Mount Apârsên. 22. Mount Sîyâk-hômand (‘being black’) _and_ Mount Vafar-hômand (‘having snow’) [^31], as far as their Kâvûl borders, have grown out of it (Apârsên) towards the direction of <i>K</i>înŏ. 23. The Spendyâ<i>d</i> [^32] mountain is in the circuit (var) of Rêvand [^33]. 24. The Kôndrâsp [^34] mountain, on the summit of which is Lake Sôvbar [^35], is in the district (or by the town) of Tûs. 25. The Kondrâs [^36] mountain is in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> [^36]. The Asnavand [^37] mountain is in Âtarô-pâtakân. 27. The Rôyi<i>s</i>n-hômand [^38] (‘having growth’) mountain is that on which vegetation has grown.

28\. Whatever [^39] mountains are those which are in every place of the various districts _and_ various <span id="p40"><sup><small>[ p. 40 ]</small></sup></span> countries, and cause the tillage _and_ prosperity therein, are many _in_ name and many _in_ number, _and_ have grown from these same mountains. 29. _As_ Mount Ganâva<i>d</i>, Mount Asparô<i>g</i>, Mount Pâhargar, Mount Dimâvand, Mount Râvak, Mount Zarîn, Mount Gêsbakht, Mount Dâva<i>d</i>, Mount Mî<i>g</i>în, _and_ Mount Marak [^40], which have all grown from Mount Apârsên, of which the other mountains are enumerated. 30. For the Dâva<i>d</i> [^41] mountain has grown into Khû<i>g</i>îstân likewise from the Apârsên mountain. 31. The Dimâvand [^42] mountain is that in which Bêvarâsp is bound. 32. From the same Padashkhvârgar mountain unto Mount Kûmî<i>s</i> [^43], _which_ they call Mount Madôfryâ<i>d</i> (‘Come-to-help’)—that in which Vi<i>s</i>tâsp routed Ar<i>g</i>âsp—is Mount Mîyân-i-da<i>s</i>t (‘mid-plain’) [^44], _and_ was broken off from that mountain there. 33. They say, in the war of the religion, when there was confusion among the Iranians it broke off from that mountain, _and_ slid down _into_ the middle of the plain; the Iranians were saved by <span id="p41"><sup><small>[ p. 41 ]</small></sup></span> it, and it was called, ‘Come-to-help’ by them. 34. The Ganâva<i>d</i> [^45] mountain is likewise there, on the Ridge of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp (pû<i>s</i>t-i Vi<i>s</i>tâspân) [^46] at the abode of the Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô fire, nine leagues (parasang) to the west. 35. Râvak Bî<i>s</i>an [^47] is in Zrâvaka<i>d</i>; this place, some say, is Zrava<i>d</i>, some call _it_ Bî<i>s</i>an, some Kalâk; from this the road of two sides of the mountain is down the middle of a fortress; for this reason, that is, because it is there formed, they call Kalâk a fortress this place they also call within the land of Sarak. 36. Mount Asparô<i>g</i> [^48] is established from the country of Lake <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast [^49] unto Pârs. 37. Pâhargar (‘the Pâhar range’) is in Khûrâsân. 38. Mount Marak [^50] is in Lârân. 39. Mount Zarîn is in Tûrkîstân. 40. Mount Bakht-tan [^51] is in Spâhân.

41\. The rest, _apart_ from this enumeration, which they reckon _as_ fostering hills of the country in the religion of the Mazdayasnians, are the small hills, those which have grown piecemeal in places.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (34:1) These are the four grades of the Mazdayasnian heaven.

[^2]: (34:2) In all the geographical details, mentioned in the Bundahi<i>s</i>, there is a strange mixture of mythical tradition with actual fact. The author of the work finds names mentioned in the Avesta, by old writers of another country, and endeavours to identify them with places known to himself; much in the same way as attempts have been made to identify the geographical details of the garden of Eden. Most of the names of these mountains occur in the Zamyâd Ya<i>s</i>t, or in other parts of the Avesta, as will be noticed in detail further on. The number 2244 is also mentioned in § 7 of that Ya<i>s</i>t. A very able commentary on this chapter will be found in Windischmann's Zoroastriche Studien, pp. 1-19.

[^3]: (35:1) The Av. Si<i>k</i>idava of Zamyâd Yt. 5.

[^4]: (35:2) See Chap. XXIX, 4, 10; the name is here written Kande<i>z</i> in R20. In M6 the word is kôf, ‘mountain,’ which is almost identical in form; if this be the correct reading, the translation will be, ‘a mountain among those in the mountain which they say is agreeable and the delight,’ &c. This mountain is, however, probably intended for the Av. A<i>n</i>tare-kangha, ‘within Kangha,’ of Zamyâd Yt. 4.

[^5]: (35:3) The Haraiti-bare<i>s</i> of Zamyâd Yt. 1; but it is more usually called Hara berezaiti (see Chap. V, 3).

[^6]: (35:4) A central peak of the mythic Albûr<i>z</i>, around which the heavenly bodies are said to revolve (see Chap. V, 3). It is the Av. Taêra, mentioned in Yas. XLI, 24, Râm Yt. 7, Zamyâd Vt. 6.

[^7]: (35:5) So in M6, but K20 has ‘go in.’

[^8]: (35:6) This appears to be another peak of the mythic Albûr<i>z</i>, probably in the west, as it is connected with Satavês, the western chieftain of the constellations (see Chaps. XXIV, 17 and II, 7), It is the Av. Hukairya berezô, of Yas. LXIV, 14, Âbân Yt. 3, 25, 96, Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 8 Mihir Yt. 88, Rashnu Yt. 24, Fravardîn Yt. 6, Râm Yt. 15.

[^9]: (35:7) See Chap. XIII, 3-5.

[^10]: (35:8) In Aûharmazd Yt. 31 and Zamyâd Yt. 2, 66, an Ushidhâo mountain is mentioned as having many mountain waters around it, but this seems to be a near neighbour of the Ushidarena mountain (see § 15). The details in the text correspond with the description of the Hindva mountain, given in Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 32, thus: us Hindva<i>d</i> paiti garôi<i>d</i> yô hi<i>s</i>taiti maidhîm zrayanghô vouru-kashahê, ‘up on the Hindva mountain, which stands amid the wide-shored p. 36 ocean;’ and the Pahlavi name, Aûsîndôm, has probably arisen from the us Hindva<i>d</i> of this passage, as suggested by Justi. (See Chaps. XIII, 5, and XVIII, 10, 11.)

[^11]: (36:1) The sky is considered to be a true firmament, or hard and indestructible dome.

[^12]: (36:2) The <i>K</i>invatô-peretu of the Avesta, mentioned even in the Gâthas. In the Pahlavi Vend. XIX, 101, it is stated that ‘they pass across by the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, whose two extremities are their own heavenly angels, one stands at <i>K</i>akâ<i>d</i>\-i-Dâîtîk, and one at Albûr<i>z</i>;’ the former mountain seems not to be mentioned in the Avesta, but the bridge is the path of the soul to the other world if righteous the soul passes by it easily over Albûr<i>z</i> (the confines of this world) into paradise, but if wicked it drops off the bridge into hell.

[^13]: (36:3) See Vend III, 23, XIX, 140. The words in brackets may perhaps be inserted by mistake, but they occur in all MSS. examined, and there is nothing inconsistent with tradition in supposing Are<i>z</i>ûr to be the extreme northern range of the mythic Albûr<i>z</i> which surrounds the earth, being the place where demons chiefly congregate.

[^14]: (36:4) Justi adopts the reading Harpârsên, which occurs in K20 four times out of eleven, but is corrected thrice. Windischmann suggests that this mountain is the Av. <i>s</i>kyata (or i<i>s</i>katâ) upairi-saêna of Yas. X, 29, and Zamyâd Yt. 3, which the Pahlavi translator of the Yasna explains as ‘the Pârsên crag.’ It seems to be a general name for the principal mountain ranges in the south and east of Iran, as maybe seen on comparing this passage and Chap. XXIV, 28, p. 37 with Chap. XX, 16, 17, 21, 22, where the Haro, Hêtûmand, Marv, and Balkh rivers are said to spring from Mount Apârsên; but its application to the southern range is perhaps due to the etymological attempt, in the text, to connect it with Pârs. The Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, VII, 7, have <i>K</i>înîstân for Khû<i>g</i>îstân.

[^15]: (37:1) This name can also be read Sîstân.

[^16]: (37:2) In § 2 it is also called Zari<i>d</i>, but in Zamyâd Yt. 1 Zeredhô and Aredhô-manusha are mentioned as neighbouring mountains. The word ‘great’ is omitted in M6.

[^17]: (37:3) That is, around the ranges of Albûr<i>z</i>, Apârsên, and Mânû<i>s</i>.

[^18]: (37:4) Perhaps intended for the Erezishô of Zamyâd Yt. 2. The description would apply to any of the mountains near Nî<i>s</i>âpûr.

[^19]: (37:5) This name is omitted in the MSS., but is taken from § 2 as suggested by Justi. Perhaps it maybe connected with ‘the country of Sênî’ (Chap. XV, 29), which is explained as being <i>K</i>înîstân, probably the land of Samarkand, which place was formerly called <i>K</i>în, according to a passage in some MSS. of Tabari‘s Chronicle, quoted in Ouseley’s Oriental Geography, p. 298.

[^20]: (37:6) Not Kâf, nor is it mentioned in the Pahlavi Vend. V, 57, as supposed by Justi; the kâf kôp ârâya<i>d</i> of Spiegel‘s edition of the Pahlavi text being a misprint for kâfakŏ pârâya<i>d</i>, ’it traverses a fissure‘ (see Haug’s Essays. 2nd ed. p. 326, note 2).

[^21]: (38:1) The Av. Ushi-darena of Yas. I, 41, II, 54, III, 65, IV, 45, XXII, 31, XXV, 22, Aûharmazd Yt. 31, Zamyâd Yt. 0, 2, 97.

[^22]: (38:2) Called Are<i>z</i>ûr-bûm in § 2, which name stands for the sixth and seventh mountains, Erezurô and Bumyô, in Zamyâd Yt. 2. The land of Arûm was the eastern empire of the Romans.

[^23]: (38:3) Evidently the mountain range south of the Caspian, now called Albûr<i>z</i>; but whether this actual Albûr<i>z</i> is to be considered a part of the mythic Albûr<i>z</i> is not very clear.

[^24]: (38:4) The Av. Raêv<i>a</i>us, ‘shining,’ of Zamyâd Yt. 6. It is also called the Ridge of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp (see § 34).

[^25]: (38:5) Or, ‘the east.’

[^26]: (38:6) See Chap. XVII, 8.

[^27]: (38:7) The Av. Vâiti-gaêsô, the twelfth mountain in Zamyâd. Yt. 2; Bâdghês in Persian.

[^28]: (38:8) In § 2 it is Bakyir, which Justi thinks is another name for Mount Dârspêt (‘white poplar’); the latter name not being repeated here makes this supposition probable.

[^29]: (38:9) K20 has rûm and M6 has lanman, but both explained by the Pâz. gloss Yim, which is also the reading of the Pâz. MSS. If the gloss be rejected the most probable translation would be, ‘and in our days Shatrô-râm (or râmi<i>s</i>n), the victorious, erected on it a myriad towns and cities.’

[^30]: (38:10) Windischmann suggests that this may he intended for the Av. <i>s</i>kyata or i<i>s</i>katâ mentioned in the note on Apârsên in § 9.

[^31]: (39:1) The Av. Syâmaka and Vafray<i>a</i>u of Zamyâd Yt. 5; and probably the Siyâh-kôh and Safêd-kôh of Afghânistân. With regard to <i>K</i>înŏ, see the note on § 13. The former mountain is called Sîyâk-mûî-mand, ‘having black hair,’ in § 2, which is certainly a more grammatical form than Sîyâk-hômand.

[^32]: (39:2) The Av. Spe<i>n</i>tô-dâta of Zamyâd Yt. 6.

[^33]: (39:3) The term var often means ‘lake,’ but we are not informed of any Lake Rêvand, though a mountain of that name is described in § 18; so it seems advisable to take var here in its wider sense of ‘enclosure, circuit, district.’

[^34]: (39:4) The Av. Kadrva-aspa of Zamyâd Yt. 6.

[^35]: (39:5) See Chap. XXII, 3. All MSS. have Sôbar here.

[^36]: (39:6) If the circumflex be used in Pahlavi to indicate not only the consonant d, but also the vowel î, ê when it follows a vowel, as seems probable, this name can be read Kôîrâs; in any case, it is evidently intended for the Av. Kaoirisa in Zamyâd Yt. 6. It is written Kôndras in § 2.

[^37]: (39:7) The Av. Asnav<i>a</i>u of Zamyâd Yt. 5, Âtash Nyây. 5, Sîrôz. 9. See also Chap. XVII, 7.

[^38]: (39:8) The Av. Raoidhitô, the eighth mountain of Zamyâd Yt. 2.

[^39]: (39:9) So in M6 and the Pâz. MSS., but K20 has, ‘The country mountains.’

[^40]: (40:1) This list is evidently intended to include the chief mountains known to the author of the Bundahi<i>s</i>, which he could not identify with any of those mentioned in the Avesta.

[^41]: (40:2) This is the Pâzand reading of the name, on which very little reliance can be placed; the Pahlavi can also be read Dâna<i>d</i>, and it may be the Deana mountain, 12,000 feet high, near Ka<i>s</i>ki-zard.

[^42]: (40:3) See Chap. XXIX, 9. This volcanic mountain, about 20,000 feet high and near Teheran, still retains this ancient Persian name, meaning ‘wintry.’ It is the chief mountain of the Padashkhvârgar range, which the Bundahi<i>s</i> evidently considers as an offshoot of the Apârsên ranges.

[^43]: (40:4) The present name of a mountain between Nî<i>s</i>âpûr and the desert.

[^44]: (40:5) The name of a place about midway between Astarâbâd and Nî<i>s</i>âpûr. This mountain is called Mî<i>g</i>în in § 29, probably from a place called Mezinan in the same neighbourhood.

[^45]: (41:1) The Pers. Kanâbad, or Gunâbad, is near <i>G</i>umin.

[^46]: (41:2) Another name for Mount Rêvand (§ 18). See Chap. XVII, 8.

[^47]: (41:3) Probably in Kirmân.

[^48]: (41:4) The mountain ranges of western Persia, including the Mount Zagros of classical writers.

[^49]: (41:5) See Chap. XXII, 2.

[^50]: (41:6) Probably the Merkhinah range in northern Lâristân.

[^51]: (41:7) The Bakhtiyârî range in the province of Ispahân.
