## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER VIII.

1\. As he (Aharman) came fourthly to the plants—which have struggled (kûkhshî-aîtŏ) against him with the whole vegetation—because the vegetation _was_ quite dry [^1], Amerôda<i>d</i>, by whom the essence of the world's vegetation [^2] was seized upon, pounded it up small, and mixed _it_ up with the rain-water of Tî<i>s</i>tar. 2. After the rain the whole earth is discerned sprouting, and ten thousand [^3] special species and a hundred thousand [^4] additional species (levatman sar<i>d</i>akŏ) so grew as if _there were_ a species of every kind; and those ten thousand species are provided for [^5] keeping away the ten thousand [^3] diseases.

3\. Afterwards, the seed was taken up from those hundred thousand species of plants, _and_ from the collection of seed the tree of all germs, amid the wide-formed ocean, was produced, from which all species of plants continually grow. 4. And the griffon bird (sênô mûrûvŏ) has his resting-place upon it; when he wanders forth _from_ within it, he scatters the dry seed into the water, _and_ it is rained back to the earth with the rain.

5\. And in its vicinity the tree was produced _which is_ the white Hôm, the counteractor of decrepitude, <span id="p177"><sup><small>[ p. 177 ]</small></sup></span> the reviver of the dead, _and_ the immortalizer of the living.

6\. This was the fourth contest, about the plants.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (176:1) This chapter is a paraphrase of Bund. IX.

[^2]: (176:2) Or, perhaps, ‘the worldly characteristics of vegetation.’

[^3]: (176:3) Written like ‘one thousand,’ but see the context and Bund. IX, 4.

[^4]: (176:4) In Bund. IX, 4, the MSS. have ‘120,000,’ which is probably wrong, as Bund. XXVII, 2, agrees with the text above.

[^5]: (176:5) The MS. has barâ instead of pavan, a blunder due probably to some copyist reading the Huzvâri<i>s</i> in Persian, in which language bih (= barâ) and bah (= pavan) are written alike. In Pâzand they are usually written b<i>e</i> and pa, respectively.
