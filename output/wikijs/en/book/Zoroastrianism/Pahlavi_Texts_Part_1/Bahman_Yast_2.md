## BAHMAN YA<i>S</i>T. CHAPTER II.

1\. In the Vohûman Ya<i>s</i>t commentary (zand) it is declared [^1] that Zaratû<i>s</i>t asked for immortality from <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> Aûharmazd a second time, _and_ spoke thus: ‘I am Zaratû<i>s</i>t, more righteous and more efficient among these thy creatures, O creator! when _thou_ shalt _make_ me [^2] immortal, as the tree opposed to harm [^3], and Gôpatshah, Gô<i>s</i>t-i Fryân, _and_ <i>K</i>îtrôk-miyân son of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, who is Pêshyôtanû, were made [^4]. 2. When thou shalt make me immortal they in thy good religion _will_ believe that the upholder of religion, who receives from Aûharmazd his pure _and_ good religion of the Mazdayasnians, will become immortal; then those men _will_ believe in thy good religion.’

3\. Aûharmazd spoke [^5] thus: ‘When I shall make thee immortal, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! then Tûr-i Brâ<i>d</i>arvash the Karap [^6] will become immortal, and <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> when Tûr-i Brâ<i>d</i>arvash the Karap shall become immortal the resurrection _and_ future existence are not possible.’

4\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t seemed uneasy about _it_ in _his_ mind [^7]; _and_ Aûharmazd, through the wisdom of omniscience, knew what was thought by Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân with the righteous spirit, and he [^8] took hold of Zaratû<i>s</i>t‘s hand. 5. And he, Aûharmazd the propitious spirit, creator of the material world, the righteous _one_, even he put the omniscient wisdom, in the shape of water, on the hand of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and said to him thus: ’Devour it.'

<span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span>

6\. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t devoured _some_ of it; thereby the omniscient wisdom was intermingled with Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and seven days and nights Zaratû<i>s</i>t was in the wisdom of Aûharmazd. 7. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t beheld the men and cattle in the seven regions of the earth, where the many fibres of hair of every one are, and whereunto the end of each fibre holds on the back. 8. And he beheld whatever trees and shrubs _there were_, and how many roots of plants were in the earth of Spendarma<i>d</i>, where _and_ how they had grown, _and_ where they were mingled.

9\. And the seventh day and night he (Aûharmazd) took back the omniscient wisdom from Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t reflected in this _way_, that I have seen _it_ in a pleasant dream produced by Aûharmazd, _and_ I am not surfeited with the dream. 10. And he took both hands, rubbed his body (kerp) again, _and spoke_ [^9] thus: ‘I have slept a long time, and am not surfeited with this pleasant dream produced by Aûharmazd.’

11\. Aûharmazd said to the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘What was seen in the pleasant dream produced by Aûharmazd?’

12\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘O Aûharmazd, propitious spirit! creator of the material world, righteous creator! I have seen a celebrity (khunî<i>d</i>) with much wealth, whose soul, infamous in the body, was hungry (gurs) [^10] and jaundiced and in hell, and he did not seem to me exalted; and I saw a beggar with no wealth and helpless, and his soul was thriving (farpîh) in paradise, and [^11] he seemed to me exalted. <span id="p198"><sup><small>[ p. 198 ]</small></sup></span> 13. \[And I saw a wealthy _man_ without children, and he did not seem to me exalted;\] [^12] and I saw a pauper with many children, and he seemed to me exalted. 14. And I saw a tree on which were seven branches, one golden, one of silver, one brazen, one of copper, \[one of tin\] [^13], one of steel, and one was mixed up with iron.’

15\. Aûharmazd spoke thus: ‘O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! this is what I say beforehand, the one tree which thou sawest is the world which I, Aûharmazd, created; and those seven branches thou sawest are the seven periods which _will_ come. 16. And that which was golden is the reign of King Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, when I and thou converse about religion, _and_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp shall accept that religion and shall demolish the figures of the demons, and the demons desist from demonstration into concealed proceedings; Aharman and the demons rush back to darkness, and care for water, fire, plants, and the earth of Spendarma<i>d</i> [^14] becomes apparent. 17. And that which was of silver [^15] is the reign of Ar<i>d</i>ashîr [^16] the <span id="p199"><sup><small>[ p. 199 ]</small></sup></span> Kayân (Kaî), whom [^17] they call Vohûman son of Spend-dâ<i>d</i> [^18], who is he who separates the demons from men, scatters _them_ about, and makes the religion current _in_ the whole world. 18. And that which was brazen [^19] is the reign of Ar<i>d</i>akhshîr [^20], the arranger and restorer of the world, and that of King Shahpûr, when he arranges the world which I, Aûharmazd, created; he makes happiness (bûkhtakîh) [^21] prevalent in the boundaries of the world, and goodness shall become manifest; and Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> of triumphant destiny, the restorer of the true religion, with the prepared brass [^22], brings this religion, together with the transgressors, back to the truth. 19. And that which was of copper is the reign of the A<i>s</i>kânian king [^23], who removes from the world <span id="p200"><sup><small>[ p. 200 ]</small></sup></span> the heterodoxy (<i>g</i>avî<i>d</i>\-rastakîh) which existed, and the wicked Akandgar-i Kilisyâkîh [^24] is utterly destroyed by this religion, _and_ goes unseen and unknown from the world. 20. And that which was of tin is the reign of King Vâhrâm Gôr [^25], when he <span id="p201"><sup><small>[ p. 201 ]</small></sup></span> makes the sight [^26] of the spirit of pleasure manifest, and Aharman with the wizards rushes back to darkness _and_ gloom. 21. And that which was of steel is the reign of King Khûsrô son of Kêvâ<i>d</i> [^27], when he keeps away from this religion the accursed Mazdîk [^28], son of Bâmdâ<i>d</i>, who remains opposed to the religion along with the heterodox. 22. And that which was mixed with iron \[is the reign of the demons with dishevelled hair [^29] of the race of Wrath, when it is the end of the tenth hundredth winter of thy millennium\], O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân!’

23\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t said thus: ‘Creator of the material world! O propitious spirit! what token would you give of the tenth hundredth winter?’

24\. Aûharmazd spoke thus: ‘Righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t! I _will_ make _it_ clear: the token that it is the end of thy millennium, and the most evil period is coming, is _that_ a hundred kinds, a thousand kinds, a myriad of kinds of demons with dishevelled hair, of the <span id="p202"><sup><small>[ p. 202 ]</small></sup></span> race of Wrath, rush into the country of Iran (Aîrân shatrô) from the direction of the east [^30], which _has_ an inferior race and race of Wrath. 25. They have uplifted banners, they slay those living in the world [^31], they have _their_ hair dishevelled on the back, and they are mostly a small and inferior (nîtûm) race, forward in destroying the strong doer; O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! the race of Wrath is miscreated (vishû<i>d</i>) and its origin is not manifest. 26. Through witchcraft they rush into these countries of Iran which I, Aûharmazd, created, since they burn and damage many things; and the house of the house-owner, the land of the land-digger, prosperity, nobility, sovereignty, religion [^32], truth, agreement, security, enjoyment, and every characteristic which I, Aûharmazd, created, this pure religion of the Mazdayasnians, and the fire of Vâhrâm, which is set in the appointed place, encounter annihilation, and the direst destruction and trouble will come into notice. 27. And that which is a great district will become a town; that which is a great town, a village; that <span id="p203"><sup><small>[ p. 203 ]</small></sup></span> which is a great village, a family; and that which is a \[great\] [^33] family, a single threshold. 28. O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! they will lead these Iranian countries of Aûharmazd into a desire for evil, _into_ tyranny _and_ misgovernment, those demons with dishevelled hair who are deceivers, so that what, they say they do not do, and they are of a vile religion, so that what they do not say they do. 29. And their assistance and promise have no sincerity, there is no law, they preserve no security, and on the support they provide no one relies; with deceit, rapacity, and misgovernment they will devastate these my Iranian countries, _who am_ Aûharmazd.

30\. ‘And at that time, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! all men will become deceivers, great friends will become of different parties, and respect, affection, hope [^34], and regard for the soul will depart from the world; the affection of the father will depart from the son; and _that of_ the brother from _his_ brother; the son-in-law will become a beggar (kîdyak or kasîk) from his father-in-law [^35], and the mother will be parted and estranged from the daughter.

31\. ‘When it is the end of thy tenth hundredth winter, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! the sun is more unseen and more spotted (vasangtar); the year, month, and day are shorter; and the earth of Spendarma<i>d</i> is more barren, and fuller of <span id="p204"><sup><small>[ p. 204 ]</small></sup></span> highwaymen [^36]; and the crop will not yield the seed, _so_ that of the crop of the corn-fields in ten _cases_ seven will diminish and three [^37] will increase, and that which increases does not become ripe [^38]; and vegetation, trees, and shrubs will diminish; when one shall take a hundred, ninety will diminish and ten will increase, and that which increases gives no pleasure and flavour. 32. And men are born smaller, and their skill and strength are less; they become more deceitful and more given to vile practices; they have no gratitude and respect for bread and salt, and they have no affection for their country (dêsak).

33\. ‘And in that most evil time a boundary has most disrespect [^39] where it is the property of a suffering man of religion; gifts are few among their deeds, and duties and good works proceed but little from their hands; and sectarians of all kinds are seeking mischief for them [^40]. 34. And all the world will be burying _and_ clothing the dead, and burying the dead _and_ washing the dead _will be_ by law; the burning, bringing to water and fire, and eating of dead matter they practise by law and do not abstain from. 35. They recount largely about duties and good works, and pursue wickedness and the road to hell; and through the iniquity, cajolery, and craving of wrath and avarice they rush to hell.

36\. ‘And in that perplexing time, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the <span id="p205"><sup><small>[ p. 205 ]</small></sup></span> Spîtâmân!—the reign of Wrath with infuriate spear [^41] and the demon with dishevelled hair, of the race of Wrath,—the meanest slaves walk forth with the authority of nobles of the land; and the religious, who wear _sacred thread_\-girdles on the waist, are then not able _to perform_ their ablution (pâ<i>d</i>îyâ<i>v</i>îh), for in those last times dead matter and bodily refuse become so abundant, that _one who_ shall set step to step walks upon dead matter; or when he washes in the barashnûm _ceremony_, and puts down a foot from the stone _seat_ (magh) [^42], he walks on dead matter; or when he arranges the _sacred_ twigs (baresôm) and consecrates the sacred cakes (drônô) in their corpse-chamber (nasâî katak) [^43] it is allowable. <span id="p206"><sup><small>[ p. 206 ]</small></sup></span> 37. Or, in those last times, it becomes allowable to perform a ceremonial (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n) with two men, so that this religion may not come to nothing and collapse [^44]; there _will_ be only one in a hundred, in a thousand, in a myriad, who believes in this religion, and even he does nothing of it though _it be_ a duty [^45]; and the fire of Vâhrâm, which will come to nothing and collapse, _falls_ off from a thousand to one care-taker, and even he does not supply it properly with firewood and incense; or when a man, _who_ has performed worship and does not know the Nîrangistân [^46] (‘code of religious formulas’), shall kindle _it_ with good intentions, it is allowable.

38\. ‘Honourable [^47] wealth will all proceed to those of perverted faith (kêvî<i>d</i>\-kêshân); it comes to the transgressors, and virtuous doers of good works, from the families of noblemen even unto the priests (môg-mar<i>d</i>ân), remain running about uncovered; the lower orders take in marriage the daughters of nobles, grandees, and priests; and the nobles, grandees, _and_ priests come to destitution _and_ bondage. 39. The misfortunes of the ignoble will overtake greatness and authority, and the helpless and ignoble will come to the foremost place _and_ advancement; the words of the upholders of religion, and the seal and decision of a just judge will become the <span id="p207"><sup><small>[ p. 207 ]</small></sup></span> words of random speakers (andê<i>z</i>ŏ-gokân) _among_ the just _and_ even the righteous; and the words of the ignoble and slanderers, of the disreputable _and_ mockers, and of those of divers opinions they consider true and credible, about which they take [^48] an oath, although with falsehood, and thereby give false evidence, and speak falsely and irreverently about me, Aûharmazd. 40. They who bear the title of priest and disciples wish evil concerning [^49] one another; he speaks vice and they look upon vice; and the antagonism of Aharman and the demons is much brought on by them; of the sin which men commit, out of five [^50] sins the priests and disciples commit three sins, and they become enemies of the good, so that they may thereby speak of bad faults relating to one another; the ceremonies they undertake they do not perform, and they have no fear of hell.

41\. ‘And in that tenth hundredth winter, _which_ is the end of thy millennium, O righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t! all mankind will bind torn hair, disregarding revelation [^51], so that a willingly-disposed cloud and a <span id="p208"><sup><small>[ p. 208 ]</small></sup></span> righteous wind are not able to produce rain in its proper time and season. 42. And a dark cloud makes the whole sky night, and the hot wind and the cold wind arrive, and bring along fruit and seed of corn, even the rain in its proper time; and it does not rain, _and_ that which rains also rains more noxious creatures than water; and the water of rivers and springs will diminish, and there will be no increase. 43. And the beast _of burden_ and ox _and_ sheep bring forth more painfully [^52] and awkwardly, and acquire less fruitfulness; and _their_ hair is coarser _and_ skin thinner; the milk does not increase and has less cream (<i>k</i>arbi<i>s</i>t); the strength of the labouring ox is less, and the agility of the swift horse is less, and it carries less in a race.

44\. ‘And on the men in that perplexing time, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! who wear the _sacred thread_\-girdle on the waist, the evil-seeking of misgovernment and much of its false judgment have come as a wind in which their living is not possible, and they seek death as a boon; and youths and children will be apprehensive, and gossiping chitchat and gladness of heart do not arise among them. 45. And they practise the appointed feasts (<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>nŏ) of _their_ ancestors, the propitiation (aûsôfrî<i>d</i>) of angels, _and_ the prayers and ceremonies of the season festivals and guardian spirits, in various places, yet that which they practise they do not believe in unhesitatingly; they do not give rewards lawfully, and <span id="p209"><sup><small>[ p. 209 ]</small></sup></span> bestow no gifts and alms, and even those \[they bestow\] [^53] they repent of again. 46. And even those men of the good religion, who have reverenced the good religion of the Mazdayasnians, proceed in conformity with (bar-hamakŏ rûbi<i>s</i>n) those ways and customs [^54], and do not believe their own religion. 47. And the noble, great, and charitable [^55], who are the virtuous of their own country and locality, will depart from their own original place and family [^56] as idolatrous; through want they beg something from the ignoble and vile, and come to poverty and helplessness; through them [^57] nine in ten of these men will perish in the northern quarter.

48\. ‘Through their way of misrule everything comes to nothingness and destitution, levity and infirmity; and the earth of Spendarma<i>d</i> opens _its_ mouth wide, _and_ every jewel and metal becomes exposed, such as gold and silver, brass, tin, and lead. 49. And rule _and_ sovereignty come to slaves, such as the Tûrk and non-Tûranian (Atûr) of the army [^58], and are turbulent as among the <span id="p210"><sup><small>[ p. 210 ]</small></sup></span> mountaineers [^59]; and the <i>K</i>înî [^60], the Kâ<i>v</i>ûlî, the Sôftî, the Rûman (Arûmâyak), and the white-clothed Karmak [^61] then attain sovereignty in my countries of Iran, _and_ their will and pleasure will become current in the world. 50. The sovereignty will come from those leathern-belted ones [^62] and Arabs (Tâ<i>z</i>îgân) and Rûmans to them, _and_ they will be so misgoverning that when they kill a righteous man who is virtuous and a fly, it is all one [^63] in their eyes. 51. And the security, fame, and prosperity, the country and families, the wealth and handiwork, the streams, rivers, and springs of Iran, and of those of the good religion, come to those non-Iranians; and the army and standards of the frontiers come to them, and a rule with a craving for wrath advances in the world. 52. And their eyes of avarice are not sated with wealth, and they form hoards of the world's wealth, and conceal _them_ underground; and through wickedness they commit sodomy, hold much intercourse with menstruous _women_, and practise many unnatural lusts.

<span id="p211"><sup><small>[ p. 211 ]</small></sup></span>

53\. ‘And in that perplexing time the night is brighter [^64], and the year, month, and day will diminish one-third; the earth of Spendarma<i>d</i> arises, and suffering, death, and destitution become more severe in the world.’

54\. Aûharmazd said to Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân: ‘This is what I foretell: that wicked evil spirit, when it shall be necessary _for him_ to perish, becomes more oppressive and more tyrannical.’

55\. So Aûharmazd spoke to Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân thus: ‘Enquire fully and learn by heart [^65] thoroughly! teach _it_ by Zand, Pâ<i>z</i>and, and explanation! tell _it_ to the priests and disciples _who_ speak forth in the world, _and_ those who are not aware of the hundred winters, tell _it_ then to them! so that, for the hope of a future existence, _and_ for the preservation of their own souls, they may remove the trouble, evil, and oppression which those of other religions cause in the ceremonies of religion. (dînô yêsnân). 56. And, moreover, I tell thee this, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! that whoever, in that time, appeals for the body is not able to save the soul, for _he is_ as it were fat, and _his_ soul is hungry _and_ lean in hell; whoever appeals for the soul, _his_ body is hungry _and_ lean through the misery of the world, and destitute, and his soul is fat in heaven.’

57 . Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûharmazd thus: ‘O Aûharmazd, propitious spirit! creator of the material world who art righteous!’—He is Aûharmazd through righteous invocation, and the rest through <span id="p212"><sup><small>[ p. 212 ]</small></sup></span> praise; some say ‘righteous creator [^66]!’—‘O creator! in that perplexing time are they righteous? and are there religious people who wear the _sacred thread_\-girdle (kûstîk) on the waist, and celebrate religious rites (dînô) [^67] with the _sacred_ twigs (baresôm)? and does the religious practice of next-of-kin marriage (khvêtûk-das) continue in their families?’

58\. Aûharmazd said to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘Of the best men is he who, in that perplexing time, wears the _sacred thread_\-girdle on the waist, and celebrates religious rites with the _sacred_ twigs, _though_ not _as_ in the reign of King Vi<i>s</i>tâsp. 59. Whoever in that perplexing time recites Itâ-â<i>d</i>\-yazam (Av. ithâ â<i>d</i> yazamaidê, Yas. Vand XXXVII) [^68] _and_ one Ashem-vohû [^69], _and_ has learned _it_ by heart, is as though, in the reign of King Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, _it were_ a Dvâ<i>z</i>dah-hômâst [^70], with holy-water (zôhar). 60. And by <span id="p213"><sup><small>[ p. 213 ]</small></sup></span> whomever prayer is offered up, _and_ the Gâtha-_hymns_ are chanted, _it is_ as though the whole ritual had been recited, _and_ the Gâtha-_hymns_ consecrated by him _in_ the reign of King Vi<i>s</i>tâsp. 61. The most perfectly righteous of the righteous is he who remains in the good religion of the Mazdayasnians, and continues the religious practice of next-of-kin marriage in his family.’

62\. Aûharmazd said to the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t: 'In these nine thousand years which I, Aûharmazd, created, mankind become most perplexed in that perplexing time; for in the evil reigns of A<i>z</i>\-i Dahâk and Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> of Tûr mankind, in those perplexing times, were living better and living more <span id="p214"><sup><small>[ p. 214 ]</small></sup></span> numerously, and their disturbance by Aharman and the demons was less. 63. For in their evil reigns, within the countries of Iran, there were not seven [^71] towns which _were_ desolate as they _will be_ when it is the end of thy millennium, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! for all the towns of Iran _will_ be ploughed up by their horses‘ hoofs, and their banners _will_ reach unto Pa<i>d</i>ashkhvârgar [^72], and they _will_ carry away the sovereignty of the seat of the religion I approve from there; and their destruction comes from that place, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! this is what I foretell.’

64\. Whoever [^73] of those existing, thus, with reverence unto the good, performs much worship for Aûharmazd, Aûharmazd, aware of _it_ through righteousness, gives _him_ whatsoever Aûharmazd is aware of through righteousness, as remuneration _and_ reward of duty _and_ good works, and _such_ members of <span id="p215"><sup><small>[ p. 215 ]</small></sup></span> the congregation, males and females, I reverence; and the archangels, who are also male and female, they are good.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (194:4) This seems to imply that this text is not the commentary p. 195 itself, but merely an epitome of it. The Pâz. MSS. which have been examined, begin with this chapter.

[^2]: (195:1) Or, ‘when I shall _become_;’ the verb is omitted by mistake in K20.

[^3]: (195:2) Three of these immortals are mentioned in Bund. XXIX, 5, and Gô<i>s</i>t-i Fryân is included in a similar enumeration in Dâ<i>d</i>. (Reply 89). The tale of Gô<i>s</i>t-i Fryân (Av. Yôi<i>s</i>tô yô Fryananãm, of Âbân Yt. 81 and Fravardîn Yt. 120) has been published with The Book of Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf,' ed. Hoshangji and Haug.

[^4]: (195:3) Or, ‘became;’ most of this verb is torn off in K20.

[^5]: (195:4) The verb is placed before its nominative in the Pahlavi text, both here and in most similar sentences, which is an imitation of the Avesta, due probably to the text being originally translated from an Avesta book now lost, or, at any rate, to its author's wish that it might appear to be so translated. In such cases of inverted construction, when the verb is in a past tense, the Pahlavi idiom often requires a pronominal suffix, corresponding, to the nominative, to be added to the first word in the sentence; thus, gûftŏ<i>s</i> Aûharmazd, or afa<i>s</i> gûft Aûharmazd, does not mean ‘Aûharmazd spoke to him (or said it),’ but merely ‘Aûharmazd spoke’ (lit. ‘it was said by him, Aûharmazd’).

[^6]: (195:5) According to an untranslated passage in the Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, mentioned in the note on [p. 187](/en/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_1/Bahman_Yast_2#p187), this is the name of p. 196 one of the five brothers in the Karapân family of sorcerers, who were enemies of Zaratû<i>s</i>t during his childhood. Their names, as written in SZS., may be read as follows, ‘Brâ<i>d</i>arvakhsh, Brâ<i>d</i>rôyi<i>s</i>nŏ, Tûr Brâgrêsh, Azânŏ, and Nasm,’ and the first is also called ‘Tûr-i ’Brâ<i>d</i>arvakhsh;’ they are described as descendants of the sister of Manû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar. In the seventh book of the Dînka<i>r</i>d a wizard, who endeavours to injure Zaratû<i>s</i>t in his childhood, is called ‘Tûr-i Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh, the Karapŏ,’ and was probably the third brother, whose name (thus corrected) indicates brâthrô-raêsha as its Avesta form. Karap or Karapân in all these passages is evidently the name of a family or caste, probably the Av. karapanô which Haug translates by ‘performers of (idolatrous) sacrificial rites,’ in connection with Sans. kalpa, ‘ceremonial ritual’ (see Haug's Essays, pp. 289-291).

[^7]: (196:1) K20 has ‘among the spirits;’ the word mîni<i>s</i>n having become maînôkân by the insertion of an extra stroke.

[^8]: (196:2) Reading afa<i>s</i> instead of mina<i>s</i> (Huz. of a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>, ‘from or by him,’ which is written with the same letters as afa<i>s</i>; ‘and by him’), not only here, but also in §§ 5, 7, 9. The copyist of K20 was evidently not aware that afa<i>s</i> is a conjunctive form, but confounded it with the prepositional form a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>, as most Parsis and some European scholars do still. The Sasanian inscriptions confirm the reading afa<i>s</i> for the conjunctive form; and Nêryôsang, the learned Parsi translator of Pahlavi texts into Pâzand and Sanskrit some four centuries ago, was aware of the difference between the two forms, as he transcribes them correctly into Paz. va<i>s</i> and a<i>z</i>a<i>s</i>.

[^9]: (197:1) This verb is omitted in K20 by mistake.

[^10]: (197:2) Or else ‘dirty.’

[^11]: (197:3) Reading afam instead of minam, both here and in § 14; the p. 198 copyist of K20 having confounded these two words, like those mentioned in the note on § 4.

[^12]: (198:1) The passage in brackets is omitted in K20, but is supplied from the Paz. MSS., being evidently necessary to complete the contrast. It occurs also in the Pers. version.

[^13]: (198:2) Supplied from the Paz. and Pers. versions, being omitted here in K20, though occurring in § 20.

[^14]: (198:3) The female archangel who has charge of the earth (see Bund. I, 26).

[^15]: (198:4) The Pâz. MSS. omit the description of the silver age.

[^16]: (198:5) Usually identified with Artaxerxes Longimanus, but his long reign of 112 years may include most of the Achæmenian sovereigns down to Artaxerxes Mnemon, several of whom are called Ahasuerus or Artaxerxes in the biblical books of Ezra and Esther. See Bund. XXXI, 30, XXXIV, 8.

[^17]: (199:1) Reading mûn, ‘whom,’ instead of amat, ‘when’ (see the note on Bund. I, 7).

[^18]: (199:2) Contracted here into Spendâ<i>d</i>, as it is also in Bund. XXXIV, 8 in the old MSS. This name of the king is corrupted into Bahman son of Isfendiyâr in the Shâhnâmah.

[^19]: (199:3) This brazen age is evidently out of its proper chronological order. The Pâzand and Persian versions correct this blunder by describing the copper age before the brazen one here, but they place the brazen branch before the copper one in § 14, so it is doubtful how the text stood originally.

[^20]: (199:4) Artakhshatar son of Pâpakî and Shahpûharî son of Artakhshatar are the Sasanian forms of the names of the first two monarchs (A.D. 226-271) of the Sasanian dynasty, whose reigns constitute this brazen age.

[^21]: (199:5) Literally, ‘deliverance _from sin_’ or ‘salvation’ by one's own good works, and, therefore, not in a Christian sense.

[^22]: (199:6) Referring to the ordeal of pouring molten brass on his chest, undergone by Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> son of Mâraspend, high-priest and prime minister of Shâpûr I, for the purpose of proving the truth of his religion to those who doubted it.

[^23]: (199:7) It is uncertain which of the A<i>s</i>kânian sovereigns is meant, or whether several of the dynasty may not be referred to. The Greek p. 200 successors of Alexander were subdued in Persia by A<i>s</i>k (Arsaces I), who defeated Seleucus Callinicus about B.C. 236. But the third book of the Dînkar<i>d</i> (in a passage quoted by Haug in his Essay on the Pahlavi Language) mentions Valkha<i>s</i> (Vologeses) the A<i>s</i>kânian as collecting the Avesta and Zand, and encouraging the Mazdayasnian religion. This Valkha<i>s</i> was probably Vologeses I, a contemporary of Nero, as shown by Darmesteter in the introduction to his translation of the Vendidad.

[^24]: (200:1) I am indebted to Professor J. Darmesteter for pointing out that Nêryôsang, in his Sanskrit translation of Yas. IX, 75, explains Kala<i>s</i>iyâkâ<i>h</i> as ‘those whose faith is the Christian religion;’ the original Pahlavi word in the oldest MSS. is Kilisâyâîk, altogether a misunderstanding of the Avesta name Keresâni, which it translates, but sufficiently near the name in our text to warrant the assumption that Nêryôsang would have translated Kilisyâkîh by ‘Christianity;’ literally it means ‘ecclesiasticism, or the church religion’ (from Pers. kilisyâ, Gr. ἐκκλησία). Akandgar is probably a miswriting of Alaksandar or Sikandar; though Darmesteter suggests that Skandgar (Av. ske<i>n</i>dô-kara, Pers. <i>s</i>ikandgar), ‘causer of destruction,’ would be an appropriate punning title for Alexander from a Persian point of view. The anachronisms involved in making Alexander the Great a Christian, conquered by an A<i>s</i>kânian king, are not more startling than the usual Pahlavi statement that he was a Roman. To a Persian in Sasanian times Alexander was the representative of an invading enemy which had come from the countries occupied, in those times, by the eastern empire of the Christian Romans, which enemy had been subdued in Persia by the A<i>s</i>kânian dynasty; and such information would naturally lead to the anachronisms just mentioned. The name Kilisyâkîh is again used, in Chap. III, 3, 5, 8, to denote some Christian enemy.

[^25]: (200:2) This Sasanian monarch (A.D. 420-439), after considerable provocation, revived the persecution of the heretics and foreign creeds which had been tolerated by his predecessor, and this conduct naturally endeared him to the priesthood.

[^26]: (201:1) Reading vênâp (Pers. bînâb), but it may be va davâ<i>g</i>, in which case the phrase must be translated as follows: ‘when he makes the spirit of pleasure and joy manifest.’

[^27]: (201:2) See Chap. I, 5. The characteristic of the steel age, like that of the tin one, was the persecution of heretics who had been tolerated by the reigning monarch's predecessor.

[^28]: (201:3) Generally written Mazdak, a heretic whose teaching was very popular in the time of King Kêvâ<i>d</i> (or Kavâ<i>d</i>, A.D. 487-531). His doctrine appears to have been extreme socialism built upon a Mazdayasnian foundation. He was put to death by Khûsrô I, as hinted in the text. It is remarkable that none of the successors of Khûsrô Nôshirvân are mentioned in the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t, so that a Parsi, who even did not believe in the verbal inspiration of the book, might possibly consider the remainder of it as strictly prophetical.

[^29]: (201:4) The passage in brackets is omitted in K20 by mistake, and is here supplied from Chap. I, 5, in accordance with the Pâz. and Pers. versions.

[^30]: (202:1) Or ‘of Khûrâsân.’ it is difficult to identify these demons with the Arabs, who came from the west, though a dweller in Kirmân might imagine that they came from Khûrâsân. In fact, hardly any of the numerous details which follow, except their long-continued rule, apply exclusively to Muhammadans. It appears, moreover, from § 50 and Chap. III, 8, that these demons are intended for Tûrks, that is, invaders from Turkistân, who would naturally come from the east into Persia.

[^31]: (202:2) Reading gêhân-zîvŏ zektelûnd, but the beginning of the latter word is torn off in K20, and the other versions have no equivalent phrase. The Pâzand substitutes the phrase ‘black banners, and black garments.’

[^32]: (202:3) This word, being torn off in K20, is supplied from the Pâz. MSS.

[^33]: (203:1) This word is omitted in K20, but supplied from the Pâzand. The whole section is omitted in the Pers. version.

[^34]: (203:2) This word, being torn off in K20, is doubtfully supplied from the Pers. paraphrase. The Pâz. MSS. omit §§ 30-32.

[^35]: (203:3) Or, perhaps, ‘parents-in-law;’ the original is khûsrûînê, followed by some word (probably naf<i>s</i>man) which is torn off in K20. The Pers. version gives no equivalent phrase.

[^36]: (204:1) Or, ‘tax-collectors;’ Pahl. tangtar va râs-vânagtar.

[^37]: (204:2) In K20 ‘va 3’ is corrupted into the very similar va vâi, ‘and a portion.’

[^38]: (204:3) Literally, ‘white.’

[^39]: (204:4) Reading anâ<i>z</i>arm instead of hanâ â<i>z</i>arm.

[^40]: (204:5) That is, for the Iranians in general, who are the ‘they’ in §§ 32-35.

[^41]: (205:1) The Av. Aêshmô khrvîdru<i>s</i>, ‘Aêshma the impetuous assailant’ (see Bund. XXVIII, 15-17); this demon's Pahlavi epithet is partly a transcription, and partly a paraphrase of the Avesta term.

[^42]: (205:2) According to Dastûr Hoshangji (Zand-Pahlavi Glossary, p. 65) the term magh is now applied to the stones on which the person undergoing purification has to squat during ablution in the barashnûm ceremony. Originally, however, Av. magha appears to have meant a shallow hole dug in the earth, near or over which the person squatted upon a seat, either of stone or some other hard material (see Vend. IX). The term for the hole was probably extended to the whole arrangement, including the seat, which latter has thus acquired the name of magh, although magh and maghâk still mean ‘a channel or pit’ in Persian.

[^43]: (205:3) The Av. kata of Vend <i>V</i>, 36-40; a special chamber for the temporary reception of the corpse, when it was impossible to remove it at once to the dakhma, owing to the inclemency of the weather. It should be large enough for standing upright, and for stretching out the feet and hands, without touching either walls or ceiling; that is, not less than six feet cube. The text means that those times will be so distressing, that it will be considered lawful to perform the sacred ceremonies even in a place of such concentrated impurity as a dead-house not actually occupied by a corpse.

[^44]: (206:1) The Pâz. MSS. add, ‘and helplessness.’

[^45]: (206:2) The Pâz. MSS. add, ‘and the prayers and ceremonies that he orders of priests and disciples they do not fulfil.’

[^46]: (206:3) The name of a work which treats of various ceremonial details, and appears to be a portion of the Pahlavi translation of the seventeenth or Hûspâram Nask, containing many Avesta quotations, which are not now to be found elsewhere.

[^47]: (206:4) The Pâz. MSS. have misread a<i>z</i>îr damîk, ‘underground,’ instead of â<i>z</i>armîk.

[^48]: (207:1) Literally, ‘devour an oath,’ which Persian idiom was occasioned by the original form of oath consisting in drinking water prepared in a particular manner, after having invoked all the heavenly powers to bear witness to the truth of what had been asserted (see the Saûgand-nâmah).

[^49]: (207:2) Reading râî instead of lâ, ‘not.’ The whole section is omitted by the Pâz. MSS., possibly from politic motives, as the language is plain enough.

[^50]: (207:3) The Persian paraphrase has ‘eight.’

[^51]: (207:4) Referring probably to the injunctions regarding cutting the hair and paring the nails, with all the proper precautions for preventing any fragments of the hair or nails from lying about, as given in Vend. XVII. One of the penalties for neglecting such precautions is supposed to be a failure of the necessary rains. The p. 208 words anâstak dînô can also be translated by ‘despising the religion.’

[^52]: (208:1) The word appears to be dar<i>d</i>aktar, but is almost illegible in K20; it may possibly be kûtaktar, ‘more scantily’ as the Pâz. MSS. have kôdaktar bahô<i>d</i>, ‘become smaller.’

[^53]: (209:1) This verb is omitted in K20.

[^54]: (209:2) It is rather doubtful whether their own customs are meant, or those of their conquerors.

[^55]: (209:3) Or dahâkân may mean ‘the skilful.’

[^56]: (209:4) Reading dû<i>d</i>ak instead of rû<i>d</i>ak. At first sight the miswriting of r for d seems to indicate copying from a text in the modern Persian character, in which those two letters are often much alike; but it happens that the compounds dû and rû also resemble one another in some Pahlavi handwriting.

[^57]: (209:5) Whether through poverty and helplessness, or through the conquerors, is not quite clear.

[^58]: (209:6) Very little reliance can be placed upon the details of this sentence, but it is difficult to make any other complete and consistent translation. Darmesteter suggests the reading hênô, ‘army,’ but another possible reading is Khyôn (Av. <i>H</i><i>v</i>yaona), the old name p. 210 of some country probably in Turkistân, as Ar<i>g</i>âsp, the opponent of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, is called ‘lord or king of Khyôn’ in the Yâ<i>d</i>kâr-i Zarîrân (see also Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 30, 31, Ashi Yt. 50, 51, Zamyâd Yt. 87).

[^59]: (210:1) Or, ‘as the mountain-holding Khûdarak.’ Darmesteter suggests that Khûdarak may be an ‘inhabitant of Khazar.’

[^60]: (210:2) Probably the people of Samarkand, which place was formerly called <i>K</i>în according to a passage in some MSS. of Tabart‘s Chronicle, quoted in Ouseley’s Oriental Geography, p. 298. See also Bund. XII, 22.

[^61]: (210:3) The Kâbulî and Byzantine Rûman are plain enough; not so the Sôftî and Karmak (Kalmak or Krimak).

[^62]: (210:4) That is, the Tûrks, as appears more clearly from Chap. III, 8, 9. The Arabs are mentioned here, incidently, for the first time, and again in Chap. III, 9, 51.

[^63]: (210:5) Literally, ‘both are one.’

[^64]: (211:1) The Pâz. version adds, ‘the motion of the sun is quicker.’

[^65]: (211:2) Literally, ‘make easy.’

[^66]: (212:1) This interpolated commentary is a pretty clear indication that the writer is translating from an Avesta text.

[^67]: (212:2) Both Pâz. and Pers. have drônô, ‘sacred cakes.’

[^68]: (212:3) The third hâ or chapter of the Yasna of seven chapters. It worships Aûharmazd as the creator of all good things.

[^69]: (212:4) See Bund. XX, 2.

[^70]: (212:5) For the following explanation of the various kinds of hômâst I am indebted to Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji Jâmâsp-Âsâ-nâ of Bombay:—
  There are four kinds of hômâst recited by priests for the atonement of any sin that may have been committed by a woman during menstruation, after her purification:—
  1\. Hômâst consists of prayers recited for 144 days, in honour of the twelve following angels: Aûharmazd, Tî<i>s</i>tar, Khûrshêd, Mâh, Âbân, Âdar, Khurdâd, Amerdâd, Spendarma<i>d</i>, Bâd, Srôsh, and Ardâ-fravash. Each angel, in turn, is reverenced for twelve days successively, with one Yasna each day.
  2\. Khadûk-hômâst, ‘one hômâst,’ differs from the last merely in adding a Vendidad every twelfth day, to be recited in the p. 213 Ushahin Gâh (12 P<i>M</i>. to 6 A<i>M</i>.) in honour of the angel whose propitiation ends that day.
  3\. Dah-hômâst, ‘ten hômâsts,’ differs from the preceding merely in having a Vendidad, in addition to the Yasna, every day.
  4\. Dvâzdah-hômâst, ‘twelve hômâsts,’ are prayers recited for 264 days in honour of twenty-two angels, namely. the twelve aforesaid and the following ten: Bahman, Ardibahi<i>s</i>t, Shahrivar, Mihir, Bahrâm, Râm, Dîn, Rashnû, Gô<i>s</i>, and Â<i>s</i>tâd. Each angel, in turn, is reverenced as in the last.
  The celebration of hômâst costs 350 rûpîs, that of khadûk-hômâst 422 rûpîs, that of dah-hômâst 1000 rûpîs, and that of dvâzdah-hômâst 2000 rûpîs; but the first and third are now no longer used. The merit obtained by having such recitations performed is equivalent to 1000 tanâpûhars for each Yasna, 10,000 for each Visparad, and 70,000 for each Vendidad recited. A tanâpûhar is now considered as a weight of 1200 dirhams, with which serious sins and works of considerable merit are estimated; originally it must have meant a sin which was ‘inexpiable’ by ordinary good works, and, conversely, any extraordinary good work which was just sufficient to efface such a sin.
  The amount of merit attaching to such recitations is variously stated in different books, and when recited with holy-water (that is, with all their ceremonial rites) they are said to be usually a hundred times as meritorious as when recited without it.

[^71]: (214:1) So in the Pâzand, but ‘seventeen’ in Persian; in K20 the word is partly illegible, but can be no other number than <i>s</i>ibâ, seven.'

[^72]: (214:2) The mountainous region south of the Caspian (see Bund. XII, 2, 17).

[^73]: (214:3) This section is the Pahlavi version of an Avesta formula which is appended to nearly two-thirds of the hâs or chapters of the Yasna, and, therefore, indicates the close of the chapter at this point. The version here given contains a few verbal deviations from that given in the Yasna, but none of any importance. The Avesta text of this formula is as follows:—
  YêNhê hâtãm âa<i>d</i>, yêsnê paitî  
  vanghô mazd<i>a</i>u ahurô vaêthâ, ashâ<i>d</i> ha<i>k</i>â,  
  y<i>a</i>unghãm<i>k</i>â, tãs<i>k</i>â t<i>a</i>us<i>k</i>â yazamaidê.
  And it may be translated in the following manner:—
  ‘Of whatever male of the existences, therefore, Ahuramazda was better cognizant, through righteousness in worship, and of whatever females, both those males and those females we reverence.’
