## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XVIII.

1\. On the nature of the tree they call Gôkar<i>d</i> [^1] it says in revelation, that _it was_ the first day when the tree they call Gôkar<i>d</i> grew in the deep mud [^2] within the wide-formed ocean; _and_ it is necessary as a producer of the renovation _of the universe_, for they prepare its immortality therefrom. 2. The evil spirit has formed therein, among those which enter as opponents, a lizard [^3] as an opponent in that deep water, so that it may injure the Hôm [^4]. 3. And for keeping away that lizard, Aûharmazd has created there ten Kar fish [^5] which, at all times, continually circle around the Hôm, so that the head of one of those fish is continually towards the lizard. 4. And together with the lizard those fish are spiritually fed [^6], that is, no food is necessary for them; _and_ till the renovation _of the universe_ they remain in contention. 5. There are places _where_ that fish is <span id="p66"><sup><small>[ p. 66 ]</small></sup></span> written _of as_ ‘the Ari<i>z</i> [^1] of the water;’ as it says that the greatest of the creatures of Aûharmazd is that fish, and the greatest of those _proceeding_ from the evil spirit is that lizard; with the jaws of _their_ bodies, moreover, they snap in two whatever of the creatures of both _spirits has_ entered between them, except that one fish which is the Vâs of Pan<i>k</i>âsa<i>d</i>varân [^2]. 6. This, too, is said, that those fish are so serpent-like [^3] in that deep water, they know the scratch (mâli<i>s</i>n) of a needle's point by which the water shall increase, or by which it is diminishing.

7\. Regarding the Vâs of Pan<i>k</i>âsa<i>d</i>varân it is declared that it moves within the wide-formed ocean, and its length is as much as what a man, while in a swift race, will walk _from_ dawn till when the sun goes down; so much that it does not itself move [^4] the length of the whole of its great body. 8. This, too, is said, that the creatures of the waters live also specially _under_ its guardianship.

9\. The tree of many seeds has grown amid the wide-formed ocean, and in its seed are all plants; some say _it is_ the proper-curing, some the energetic-curing, some the all-curing [^5].

<span id="p67"><sup><small>[ p. 67 ]</small></sup></span>

10\. Between [^1] these trees of such kinds [^2] is formed the mountain with cavities, 9999 thousand myriads _in number_, each myriad being ten thousand. 11. Unto that mountain is given the protection of the waters, so that water streams forth from there, in the rivulet channels, to the land of the seven regions, as the source of all the sea-water in the land of the seven regions is from there [^3].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (65:1) A corruption of the Av. gaokerena of Vend. XX, 17, Aûharmazd Yt. 30, Haptân Yt. 3, Sîrôz, 7. In the old MSS. of the Bundahi<i>s</i> the form gôkar<i>d</i> occurs thrice, gôkarn once, and gogrv once.

[^2]: (65:2) Reading gil, ‘mud.’ Windischmann and Justi prefer gar, ‘mountain,’ and have ‘depth of the mountain.’

[^3]: (65:3) That the writer of the Bundahi<i>s</i> applies the term vazagh to a lizard, rather than a frog, appears from the ‘log-like lizard’s body' of Chap. III, 9.

[^4]: (65:4) That is, the Gôkar<i>d</i> tree, which is the white Hôm (see Chap. XXVII, 4).

[^5]: (65:5) The Av. karô masyô of Vend. XIX, 140, Bahrâm Yt. 29, Dîn Yt. 7; see also Chap. XXIV, 13.

[^6]: (65:6) Windischmann and Justi prefer translating thus: ‘Moreover, the lizard is the spiritual food of those fish;’ but this can hardly be reconciled with the Pahlavi text.

[^1]: (66:1) See Chaps. XIV, 26, and XXIV, 13.

[^2]: (66:2) The Av. vâsîm yãm pa<i>n</i><i>k</i>âsadvarãm of Yas. XLI, 27.

[^3]: (66:3) Transcribing the Pâz. mârâdu into Pahlavi we have mâr âyin, ‘snake’s manner.' Compare the text with Bahrâm Yt. 29.

[^4]: (66:4) K20 omits the words from ‘walk’ to ‘move.’

[^5]: (66:5) This is the tree of the saêna or Simurgh, as described in Rashnu Yt. 17, and these three epithets are translations of its three titles, hubi<i>s</i>, eredhwô-bi<i>s</i>, and vîspô-bi<i>s</i>. See also Chap. XXVII, 2, 3.

[^1]: (67:1) This must have been the original meaning of the Huz. dên (bên in the Sasanian inscriptions) before it was used as a synonym of Pâz. andar, ‘within.’ The mountain is between the white-Hôm tree and the tree of many seeds.

[^2]: (67:2) Transcribing the Pâz. oînoh into Pahlavi we have ân-gûnak, ‘that kind;’ or the word may be a miswriting of Pâz. ânô, ‘there.’

[^3]: (67:3) This description of the mountain seems to identify it with the Aûsîndôm mountain of Chaps. XII, 6, and XIII, 5.
