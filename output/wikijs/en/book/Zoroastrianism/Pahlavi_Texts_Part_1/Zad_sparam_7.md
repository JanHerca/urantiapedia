## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER VII.

1\. And as he (Aharman) came thirdly to the earth, which arrayed the whole earth against him— <span id="p174"><sup><small>[ p. 174 ]</small></sup></span> since _there was_ an animation of the earth through the shattering—Albûr<i>z</i> grew up [^1], which is the boundary of the earth, _and_ the other [^2] mountains, which are amid the circuit of the earth, come up 2244 in number [^3]. 2. And by them the earth _was_ bound together and arranged, and on them _was_ the sprouting and growth of plants, wherefrom _was_ the nourishment of cattle, and therefrom was the great advantage of assistance to men.

3\. Even so it is declared that before the coming of the destroyer to the creatures, for a thousand years the substance of mountains was created in the earth—especially as antagonism came on the earth, _and_ settled on _it_ with injury—_and_ it came up over the earth just like a tree _whose_ branch _has_ grown at the top, and its root at the bottom. 4. The root of the mountains is passed on _from_ one to the other, _and_ is arranged in connection _with them_, and through it is produced the path _and_ passage of water _from_ below to above, so that the water may flow in it in such manner as blood in the veins, from all _parts_ of the body to the heart, the latent vigour which they possess. 5. And, moreover, in six hundred years [^4], at first, all the mountains apart from Albûr<i>z</i> were completed. 6. Albûr<i>z</i> was growing during eight hundred years [^5]; in two hundred years it grew up to <span id="p175"><sup><small>[ p. 175 ]</small></sup></span> the star station, in two hundred years up to the moon station, two hundred years up to the sun station, _and_ two hundred years up to the sky. 7. After Albûr<i>z</i> the Aparsên mountain [^1] is the greatest, as it is also called the Avar-rôyi<i>s</i>n [^2] (up-growth') mountain, whose beginning is in Sagastân and its end unto Pârs and to <i>K</i>înîstân [^3].

8\. This, too, is declared, that after the great rain in the beginning of the creation [^4], _and_ the wind‘s sweeping away the water to the ocean, the earth is in seven portions [^5], a little above _it_, as the compact earth, after the rain, is torn up by the noise and wind _in_ various places. 9. One portion, moreover, as much as one-half the whole earth, is in the middle, and in _each of_ the six portions around is as much as Sagastân; moreover, as much as Sagastân is the measure _of what_ is called a keshvar (’region‘) for the reason that one was defined from the other by a kêsh (’furrow'). 10. The middle _one_ is Khvanîras, of which Pârs is the centre, and those six regions are like a coronet (a<i>v</i>îsar) _around it_. 11. One part of the wide-formed ocean wound around it, among those six regions; the sea and forest seized upon the south side, _and_ a lofty mountain grew up on the north, so that they might become separate, one from the other, _and_ imperceptible.

12\. This is the third contest, about the earth.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (174:1) Bund. VIII, 1-4 is paraphrased in §§ 1-4.

[^2]: (174:2) The MS. has âvânŏ, ‘waters,’ instead of avârîk, ‘other,’ which alters the meaning into, ‘which is the boundary of the waters of the earth, _and_ the mountains,’ &c.

[^3]: (174:3) Bund. XII, 2.

[^4]: (174:4) Bund. VIII, 5, and XII, 1, have ‘eighteen years.’ As both numbers are written in ciphers it would be easy for either to be corrupted into the other.

[^5]: (174:5) Bund. XII, 1.

[^1]: (175:1) The Apârsên of Bund. XII, 9.

[^2]: (175:2) Written Apû-rôyi<i>s</i>n, as if it were an Arabic hybrid meaning ‘father of growth.’

[^3]: (175:3) Bund. XII, 9. XXIV, 28, have Khû<i>g</i>îstân instead of <i>K</i>înîstân; the latter appears to be an old name of the territory of Samarkand (see note to Bund. XII, 13).

[^4]: (175:4) Literally, ‘creature.’

[^5]: (175:5) Bund. XI, 2-4 is paraphrased in §§ 8-11.
