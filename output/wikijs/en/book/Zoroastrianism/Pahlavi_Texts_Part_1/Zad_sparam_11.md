## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER XI.

1\. As he (Aharman) came seventhly to fire, which was all together _against_ him, the fire _separated_ into five kinds [^1], which are called the Propitious, the Good diffuser, the Aûrvâzî<i>s</i>t, the Vâzî<i>s</i>t, and the Supremely-_benefiting_. 2. And it produced the Propitious fire itself in heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân); its manifestation is in the fire which is burning on the earth, and its propitiousness is this, that all the kinds are of its nature. 3. _The Good diffuser_ is that which is in men and animals [^2], and its business _consists_ in the digestion of the food, the sleeping of the <span id="p185"><sup><small>[ p. 185 ]</small></sup></span> body, _and_ the brightening of the eyes. 4. The Aûrvâzî<i>s</i>t is that which is in plants, in whose seed _it_ is formed, and its business _consists_ in piercing the earth, warming the chilled water [^3] and producing the qualities and fragrance of plants and blossoms therefrom, and elaborating the ripened produce into many fruits. 5. And the Vâzî<i>s</i>t is that which has its motion in a cloud, and its business _consists_ in destroying the atmospheric gloom and darkness, and making the thickness of the atmosphere fine and propitious in quality, sifting the hail, moderately warming the water which the cloud holds, _and_ making sultry weather showery. 6. The Supremely-benefiting, like the sky, is that glory whose lodgment is in the Behrâm fire [^4], as the master of the house is over the house, _and_ whose propitious power _arises_ from the growing brightness of the fire, the blazing forth in [^5] the purity of the place, the praise of God (yazdânŏ), _and_ the practice of good works. 7. And its business is _that_ it struggles with the spiritual fiend, it watches the forms of the witches—who walk up from the river [^6], wear woven clothing, disturb the luminaries by the concealment of stench, _and_ by witchcraft injure the creatures—and the occurrences of destruction, burning, and celebration of witchcraft, especially at night; being an assistant of Srôsh the righteous.

8\. And in the beginning of the creation [^7] the whole earth was delivered over into the guardianship of the sublime Frôbak fire, the mighty Gû<i>s</i>nasp fire, and the beneficial Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô fire [^8], _which_ are like priest, warrior, and husbandman. 9. The place of the fire Frôbak was formed _on_ the Gadman-hômand (‘glorious’) mountain in Khvâri<i>z</i>em [^9], the fire Gû<i>s</i>nasp _was_ on the Asnavand mountain in Âtarô-pâtakân, _and_ the fire Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô on the Rêvand mountain which is in the Ridge _of_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, and its material manifestation in the world was the most complete.

10\. In the reign of Hôshâng [^10], when men were continually going forth to the _other_ regions (kêshvar) on the ox Srûvô [^11], one night, half-way, while admiring the fires, the fire-stands which were prepared in three places on the back of the ox, _and_ in which the fire was, fell into the sea, and the substance of that one great fire _which_ was manifest, is divided into three, _and_ they established _it_ on the three fire-stands, and it became itself three glories whose lodgments are in the Frôbak fire, the Gû<i>s</i>nasp fire, and the Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô [^12].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (184:3) Bund. XVII, 1. Three of the Avesta names are here translated, the first two being the Spêni<i>s</i>t and Vohu-fryãn, which are the fifth and second in the Bundahi<i>s</i>, and the fifth being the Berezi-savang, which is the first in the Bundahi<i>s</i>.

[^2]: (184:4) See Bund. XVII, 2.

[^3]: (185:1) Reading mayâ-i afsar<i>d</i>înî<i>d</i>ŏ tâftanŏ instead of the seemingly unmeaning mayâ a<i>s</i>ar<i>d</i>înî<i>d</i>ŏ âftanŏ of the MS.

[^4]: (185:2) The Verehrânŏ âtâsh, or sacred fire of the fire-temples.

[^5]: (185:3) Reading pavan instead of barâ (see p. 176, note 5).

[^6]: (185:4) Or ‘sea’ (darîyâ<i>v</i>ŏ). This long-winded sentence is more involved and obscure in the original than in the translation.

[^7]: (186:1) Literally, ‘creature.’

[^8]: (186:2) The epithets of these three sacred fires are, respectively, var<i>g</i>ân, tagîkŏ, and pûr-sû<i>d</i>ŏ in Pahlavi.

[^9]: (186:3) See Bund. XVII, 5, 7, 8.

[^10]: (186:4) Bund. XVII, 4 says, ‘in the reign of Takhmôrup,’ his successor.

[^11]: (186:5) Sarsaok or Srisaok in the Bundahi<i>s</i>.

[^12]: (186:6) The remainder of ‘the sayings of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, about the meeting of the beneficent spirit _and_ the evil spirit,’ have no special reference to the Bundahi<i>s</i>. They treat of the following matters:—
  The coming of the religion, beginning in the time of Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> and Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, with an anecdote of Kâî-ûs and the hero Srîtô (Av. Thrita). The manifestation of the glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t p. 187 before his birth. The begetting of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through the drinking of hôm-juice and cow‘s milk infused, respectively, with his guardian spirit and glory, as declared in the manuscript on ’the guidance of worship.‘ The connection of Zaratû<i>s</i>t with Aûharmazd, traced back through his genealogy as far as Gâyômar<i>d</i>. The persistent endeavours of the fiends to destroy Zaratû<i>s</i>t at the time of his birth, and how they were frustrated. His receiving the religion from Aûharmazd, with another anecdote of Kâî-ûs and Srîtô, and of Zaratû<i>s</i>t’s exclamation on coming into the world. The enmity borne to him by five brothers of the Karapân family, and how it was frustrated; his own four brothers, and some of his wonderful deeds. The worthiness of his righteousness; his compassionate and liberal nature; his giving up worldly desires; his pity; his good selection of a wife; and what is most edifying for the soul. What occurred when he was thirty years old, and his being conducted by the archangel Vohûman to the assembly of the spirits. The questions asked by Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and Aûharmazd‘s replies thereto. The seven questions he asked of the seven archangels in seven different places, in the course of one winter. \[Westergaard’s MS. K35 ends in the middle of the second of these questions.\] The five dispositions of priests, and the ten admonitions. The three preservatives of religion, with particulars about the Gâthas and the connection of the Ahunavar with the Nasks. Zaratû<i>s</i>t's obtaining one disciple, Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, in the first ten years, and the acceptance of the religion by Vi<i>s</i>tâsp two years afterwards.
  The second of the writings of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam consists of his ‘sayings about the formation of men out of body, life, and soul;’ and the third (which is imperfect in all known MSS.) contains his ‘sayings about producing the renovation _of the universe_.’
