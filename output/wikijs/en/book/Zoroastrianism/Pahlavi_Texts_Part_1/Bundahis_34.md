## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXXIV [^1].

0\. On the reckoning of the years [^2].

1\. Time was _for_ twelve thousand years; _and_ it says in revelation, that three thousand years was the duration of the spiritual _state_, where the creatures were unthinking, unmoving, _and_ intangible [^3]; _and_ three thousand years [^4] was the duration of Gâyômar<i>d</i>, with the ox, in the world. 2. As _this_ was six thousand years series of millennium reigns [^5] of Cancer, Leo, and Virgo had elapsed, because it was six thousand years when the millennium reign came to Libra, the adversary rushed in, and Gâyômar<i>d</i> lived thirty years in tribulation [^6]. After the thirty years [^7] Mâshya _and_ Mashyôî grew up; it was fifty years while they were not wife _and_ husband [^8], _and_ they were ninety-three years together _as_ wife _and_ husband till the _time_ when Hôshyang [^9] came.

4\. Hôshyang _was_ forty years [^10], Takhmôrup [^11] thirty years, Yim till _his_ glory [^12] departed six hundred and <span id="p150"><sup><small>[ p. 150 ]</small></sup></span> sixteen years and six months, _and_ after that he was a hundred years in concealment. 5. Then the millennium [^13] reign came to Scorpio, and Dahâk [^14] ruled a thousand years. 6. After the millennium reign came to Sagittarius, Frê<i>d</i>ûn [^15] _reigned_ five hundred years; in the same five hundred years of Frê<i>d</i>ûn _were_ the twelve years of Aîrî<i>k</i>; Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^16] _was_ a hundred and twenty years, _and_ in the same reign of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, when he was in the mountain fastness (dûshkhvâr-gar) [^17], _were_ the twelve years of Frâsîyâ<i>v</i>; Zôb [^18] the Tûhmâspian _was_ five years.

7\. Kaî-Kabâ<i>d</i> [^19] _was_ fifteen years; Kaî-Kâûs, till he went to the sky, seventy-five years, _and_ seventy-five years after that, altogether a hundred and fifty years; Kai-Khûsrôv sixty years; Kaî-Lôrâsp [^20] a hundred and twenty years; Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, till the coming of the religion, thirty years [^21], altogether a hundred and twenty years.

8\. Vohûman [^22] _son_ of Spend-dâ<i>d</i> a hundred and <span id="p151"><sup><small>[ p. 151 ]</small></sup></span> twelve years; Hûmâî, who _was_ daughter of Vohûman, thirty years; Dârâî son of Kîhar-i-â<i>z</i>â<i>d</i> [^23], that is, _of the daughter_ of Vohûman, twelve years; Dârâî son of Dârâî fourteen years; Alexander the Rûman [^24] fourteen years.

9\. The A<i>s</i>kânians bore the title in an uninterrupted (a-arûbâk) sovereignty two hundred and eighty-four years [^25], Ardashîr son of Pâpak _and_ the number of the Sâsânians four hundred and sixty years [^26], and then it went to the Arabs.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (149:1) This chapter is found in all the MSS.

[^2]: (149:2) TD adds ‘of the Arabs (Tâ<i>z</i>îkân).’

[^3]: (149:3) See Chap. I, 8.

[^4]: (149:4) See Chaps. I, 22, III, 1.

[^5]: (149:5) This system of a millennium reign for each constellation of the zodiac can hardly have any connection with the precession of the equinoxes, as the equinoxes travel backwards through the zodiac, whereas these millennium reigns travel forwards.

[^6]: (149:6) See Chap. III, 21-23.

[^7]: (149:7) That is, forty years after the thirty (see Chap. XV, 2).

[^8]: (149:8) See Chap. XV, 19, 20.

[^9]: (149:9) See Chaps. XV, 28. XXXI, 1.

[^10]: (149:10) K20 omits, by mistake, from ‘together’ in § 3 to this point.

[^11]: (149:11) See Chap. XXXI, 2.

[^12]: (149:12) So in K20, but M6 has nismô, ‘soul, reason,’ as in Chap. XXIII, 1; the word ‘glory’ would refer to the supposed divine glory of the Iranian monarchs (see Chap. XXXI. 32).

[^13]: (150:1) The seventh millennium, ruled by Libra, is computed by Windischmann as follows: 30 + 40½ + 50 + 93 + 40 + 30 + 616½ + 100 = 1000. The eighth millennium, ruled by Scorpio, is the thousand years of Dahâk.

[^14]: (150:2) See Chap. XXXI, 6.

[^15]: (150:3) See Chap. XXXI, 7-11.

[^16]: (150:4) See Chap. XXXI, 12-14.

[^17]: (150:5) See Chap. XXXI, 21.

[^18]: (150:6) Written Aûzôbô in Chap. XXXI, 23, 24.

[^19]: (150:7) Usually written Kai-Kavâ<i>d</i> in Pahlavi (see Chap. XXXI, 24,25).

[^20]: (150:8) Also written Kaî-Lôharâsp (see Chap. XXXI, 28, 29).

[^21]: (150:9) This is the end of the ninth millennium, ruled by Sagittarius, which is computed by Windischmann as follows, 500 + 120 + 5 + 15+ 150 +60+ 120+ 30 = 1000.

[^22]: (150:10) See Chap. XXXI, 29, 30, where he is said to have been also called Artakhshatar, which seems to identify him with Artaxerxes Longimanus and his successors down to Artaxerxes Mnemon; so that Hûmâî may perhaps be identified with Parysatis, and Dârâî <i>K</i>ihar-â<i>z</i>âdân with Artaxerxes Ochus, as Dârâî Dârâyân must be p. 151 Darius Codomannus, while the reign of Kai-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp seems intended to cover the period from Cyrus to Xerxes.

[^23]: (151:1) A surname of Hûmâî.

[^24]: (151:2) Sikandar-i Arûmâk, that is, Alexander the Roman (of the eastern or Greek empire), as Pahlavi writers assume.

[^25]: (151:3) This period is nearly two centuries too short.

[^26]: (151:4) The actual period of Sasanian rule was 425 years (A.D. 226-651). According to the figures given in the text, the tenth millennium, ruled by Capricornus, must have terminated in the fourth year of the last king, Yazdakar<i>d</i>. This agrees substantially with the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t, which makes the millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t expire some time after the reign of Khûsrô Nôshirvân; probably in the time of Khûsrô Parvîz, or some forty years earlier than the fourth year of Yazdakar<i>d</i>. According to the text we must now be near the end of the first quarter of the twelfth and last millennium.
