## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXVIII [^1].

1\. On the evil-doing of Aharman _and_ the demons it says in revelation, that the evil which the evil spirit has produced for the creation of Aûharmazd it is possible to tell by this winter [^2]; and his body is that of a lizard (vazagh) [^3] _whose_ place is filth (kal<i>k</i>). 2. He does not think, nor speak, nor act _for_ the welfare (nadûkîh) of the creatures of Aûharmazd; and his business is unmercifulness and the destruction of this _welfare_, so that the creatures which Aûharmazd shall increase he will destroy; and _his_ eyesight (<i>k</i>ashm mî<i>k</i>i<i>s</i>n) [^4] does not refrain from doing the creatures harm. 3. As it says that, ‘ever <span id="p106"><sup><small>[ p. 106 ]</small></sup></span> since a creature was created by, us, I, who am Aûharmazd, have not rested at ease, on account of providing protection for my own creatures; and likewise not even he, the evil spirit, on account of contriving evil for the creatures.’ 4. And by _their_ devotion to witchcraft (yâtûk-dînôîh) he seduces mankind into affection for himself and disaffection to Aûharmazd [^5], so that they forsake the religion of Aûharmazd, and practise that of Aharman. 5. He casts this into the thoughts of men, that this religion of Aûharmazd is nought, and it is not necessary to be steadfast in it. 6. Whoever gives that man anything, in whose law (dâ<i>d</i>) this saying is established, then the evil spirit is propitiated by him, that is, he has acted by his pleasure.

7\. The business of Akôman [^6] is this, that he gave vile thoughts and discord to the creatures. 8. The business of the demon Andar is this, that he constrains the thoughts of the creatures from deeds of virtue, just like a leader who _has_ well-constrained (sardâr-i khûp afsâr<i>d</i>ŏ); _and_ he casts this into the thoughts of men, that it is not necessary to have the _sacred_ shirt _and thread_\-girdle. 9. The business of the demon Sâvar [^7], that is a leader of the demons, is this, that is, misgovernment, oppressive anarchy, and drunkenness. 10. The business of the demon Nâîkîyas [^8] is this, that he gives discontent to the creatures; as it says, that should this _one_ <span id="p107"><sup><small>[ p. 107 ]</small></sup></span> give anything to those men whose opinion (dâ<i>d</i>) is this, that it is not necessary to have the _sacred_ shirt _and thread_\-girdle, then Andar, Sâvar, and Nâîkîyas are propitiated by him. 11. The demon Taprê<i>v</i> [^9] is he who mingles poison with plants and creatures; as it says thus: ‘Taprê<i>v</i> the frustrater, _and_ Zâîrî<i>k</i> the maker of poison.’ 12. All those six, it is said, are arch-fiends [^10] of the demons; the rest are cooperating and confederate with them. 13. This, too, it says, that\] [^11] should _one_ give \[anything to\] a man who says \[that it is proper to have one boot\], and in his law walking with one boot \[is established, then\] [^12] the fiend Taprê<i>v</i> is propitiated \[by him\].

14\. The demon Tarômat [^13] \[is he who\] produces disobedience; the demon Mîtôkht [^14] is the liar (drô<i>g</i>an) of the evil spirit [^15]; the demon Ara<i>s</i>k [^16] (‘malice’) is the spiteful fiend of the evil eye. 15. Theirs are the same [^17] appliances as the demon Aeshm's [^18], as it <span id="p108"><sup><small>[ p. 108 ]</small></sup></span> says that seven powers are given _to_ Aeshm [^19], that he may utterly destroy the creatures therewith; with those seven powers he will destroy seven [^20] of the Kayân heroes in his own time, _but_ one will remain. 16. There where Mîtôkht (‘falsehood’) arrives, Ara<i>s</i>k (‘malice’) becomes welcome, \[and there where Ara<i>s</i>k is welcome\] [^21] Aeshm lays a foundation [^22], and there where Aeshm has a foundation [^23] many creatures perish, _and_ he causes much non-Iranianism [^24]. 17. Aeshm mostly contrives all evil for the creatures of Aûharmazd, _and_ the evil deeds of those Kayân heroes have been more complete through Aeshm, as it says, that Aeshm, the impetuous assailant, causes them most [^25].

18\. The demon Vîzarêsh [^26] is he who struggles with the souls of men which _have_ departed, those <span id="p109"><sup><small>[ p. 109 ]</small></sup></span> days and nights [^27] when _they remain_ in the world; he carries _them_ on, terror-stricken, _and_ sits at the gate of hell. 19. The demon Uda [^28] is he who, when a man sits in a private place, or when he eats at meals, strikes _his_ knee spiritually on _his_ back [^29], so that he bawls out \[_and_ looks out, that chattering he may eat, chattering\] he may evacuate (rîe<i>d</i>), and chattering he may make water (mêzê<i>d</i>), so that he may not attain \[unto the\] best existence [^30] .

\[20. The demon Akâtâsh [^31] is the fiend of perversion (nikîrâyîh), who makes the creatures averse (nikîrâî) from proper things; as it says, that whoever _has_ given anything to that person (tanû) whose opinion (dâ<i>d</i>) is this, that it is not necessary to have a high-priest (dastôbar), then the demon Aeshm is propitiated by him. 21. Whoever _has_ given anything to that person whose opinion is this, _and_ who says, that it is not necessary to have a snake-killer (mâr-van), then Aharman, with the foregoing demons, is propitiated by him; this is said of him who, when he sees a noxious creature, does not kill _it_. 22. A snake-killer (mâro-gnô) [^32] is a stick on the end of which a leathern _thong_ is <span id="p110"><sup><small>[ p. 110 ]</small></sup></span> provided; and it is declared that every one of the good religion must possess one, that they may strike _and_ kill noxious creatures _and_ sinners more meritoriously with it.

23\. Zarmân [^33] is the demon who makes decrepit (dûspa<i>d</i>), whom they call old age (pirîh). 24. <i>K</i>îshmak [^34] is he who makes disastrous (vazandak), and also causes the whirlwind [^35] _which_ passes over for disturbance. 25. The demon Varenô [^36] is he who causes illicit intercourse, as it says thus: ‘Varenô the defiling (âlâî).’ 26. The demon Bûshâsp [^37] is she who causes slothfulness; Sê<i>g</i> is the fiend (drû<i>g</i>) who causes annihilation; and the demon Nîyâz is he who _causes_ distress.

27\. The demon Âz [^38] (‘greediness’) is he who swallows everything, and when, through destitution, nothing has come he eats himself; he is that fiendishness which, although the whole wealth of the world be given up to it, does not fill up and is not satisfied; as it says, that the eye of the covetous is a noose (gamand), and _in_ it the world is nought. 28. Pû<i>s</i> [^39] is the demon who makes a hoard, _and_ <span id="p111"><sup><small>[ p. 111 ]</small></sup></span> does not consume _it, and_ does not give to any one; as it says, that the power of the demon Âz is owing to that person who, not content with his own wife, snatches away even those of others.

29\. The demon Nas [^40] is he who causes the pollution and contamination (nisrû<i>s</i>tih), which they call nasâi (‘dead matter’). 30. The demon Frîftâr (‘deceiver’) is he who seduces mankind. 31. The demon Spazg [^41] (‘slander’) is he who brings _and_ conveys discourse (milayâ), _and_ it is nothing in appearance such _as_ he says; and he shows that mankind fights _and_ apologizes (avakhshînê<i>d</i>), individual with individual. 32. The demon Arâst [^42] (‘untrue’) is he who speaks falsehood. 33. The demon Aîghâsh [^43] is the malignant-eyed fiend who smites mankind with _his_ eye. 24. The demon Bût [^44] is he whom they worship among the Hindûs, and his growth is lodged in idols, as one worships the horse _as_ an idol [^45]. 35 Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> [^46] is the evil flyer (vâê-i sarîtar) who seizes the life; as it says that, when <span id="p112"><sup><small>[ p. 112 ]</small></sup></span> _his_ hand strokes a man _it is_ lethargy, when he casts _it_ on the sick _one it is_ fever, when he looks in his eyes he drives away the life, and they call it death. 36. The demon of the malignant eye (sûr-<i>k</i>ashmîh) is he who will spoil anything which men see, _when_ they do not say ‘in the name of God’ (yazdân).

37\. With every one of them are many demons _and_ fiends co-operating, to specify whom a second time _would be_ tedious; demons, too, who are furies (khashmakân), are in great multitude it is said. 38. They are demons of ruin, pain, and growing old (zvârân), producers of vexation and bile, revivers of grief (nîvagîh), the progeny of gloom, and bringers of stench, decay, and vileness, who are many, very numerous, and very notorious; and a portion of all of them is mingled in the bodies of men, _and their_ characteristics are glaring in mankind.

39\. The demon Apâôsh [^47] and the demon Aspen<i>g</i>argâk [^48] are those who remain in contest with the rain. 40. Of the evil spirit [^49] are the law of vileness, the religion of sorcery, the weapons of fiendishness, and the perversion (khâmîh) of God's works; and <span id="p113"><sup><small>[ p. 113 ]</small></sup></span> his wish is this, that is: ‘Do not ask _about_ me, and do not understand me! for if ye ask _about_ and understand me, ye _will_ not come after me [^50].’ 41. This, too, it says, that the evil spirit remains at the distance of a cry, even at the cry of a three-year-old cock (kûlêng), even at the cry of an ass, even at the cry of a righteous man when _one_ strikes _him_ involuntarily _and_ he utters a cry [^51]. 42. The demon Kûndak [^52] is he who is, the steed (bârak) of wizards.

43\. Various new demons _arise_ from the various new sins the creatures may commit, _and_ are produced for such _purposes_; who make even those planets rush _on_ which are in the _celestial_ sphere, _and_ they stand very numerously in the conflict. 44. Their ringleaders (kamârîkân) are those seven _planets_, the head and tail of Gô<i>k</i>îhar, and Mû<i>s</i>par [^53] <span id="p114"><sup><small>[ p. 114 ]</small></sup></span> provided with a tail, _which_ are ten. 45. And by them these ten worldly creations, _that_ is, the sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, metals, wind, light, fire, and mankind, are corrupted with all this vileness; and from them calamity, captivity, disease, death, and other evils and corruptions ever come to water, vegetation, and the other creations which exist _in_ the world, owing to the fiendishness of those ten. 46. They whom I _have_ enumerated are _furnished_ with the assistance and crafty (afzar-hômand) nature of Aharman.

47\. Regarding the cold, dry, stony, and dark interior of mysterious (târîk dên afrâ<i>g</i>\-pê<i>d</i>âk) hell it says, that the darkness is fit to grasp with the hand [^54], and the stench is fit to cut with a knife; and if they inflict the punishment of a thousand men within a single span, they (the men) think in this _way_, that they are alone; _and_ the loneliness is worse than its punishment [^55]. 48. And its connection (band) is with the seven planets, be it through much cold like Saturn [^56] (Kêvân), be it through much heat like Aharman; and their food is brimstone (gandak), and of succulents the lizard (vazagh), _and_ other evil _and_ wretchedness (patyân).\]

## Footnotes

[^1]: (105:3) Chaps. XXVIII, XXIX, and XXXI are omitted in M6 and all MSS. descended from it, whether Pahlavi or Pâzand; and, owing to the loss of a folio from K20 before any of its extant copies were written, the first quarter of Chap. XXVIII has hitherto been missing, but is here supplied (enclosed in brackets) from TD, a MS. belonging to Mobad Tahmuras Dinshaw (see Introduction).

[^2]: (105:4) Winter being one of the primary evils brought upon creation by Angra-mainyu (see Vend. I, 8-12).

[^3]: (105:5) See Chap. III, 9.

[^4]: (105:6) Referring to ‘the evil eye.’

[^5]: (106:1) Compare Chap. I, 14.

[^6]: (106:2) The six arch-fiends of this paragraph are those mentioned in Chaps. I, 27, XXX, 29.

[^7]: (106:3) Written Sôvar in Chap. I, 27.

[^8]: (106:4) Written Nâkahê<i>d</i> in Chap. I, 27, Nâîkîya<i>s</i> when repeated in this sentence, and Pâz. Nâûnghas in Chap. XXX, 29.

[^9]: (107:1) Written Tâîrê<i>v</i> in Chap. I, 27.

[^10]: (107:2) See Chap. III, 2.

[^11]: (107:3) From this point the Pahlavi text is extant in K20, except some illegible words, the translation of which (supplied from TD) is here enclosed in brackets.

[^12]: (107:4) Anquetil, misled by the lacuna in his MS., thought that there was a change of subject here, and began a new chapter at this point. On this account the numbers of his chapters are henceforth one in excess of those in this translation.

[^13]: (107:5) Written Tarôkmatŏ in TD, and identified with Nâûnghas (Nâîkîyas) in Chap. XXX, 29; a personification of the Av. tarômaiti, ‘disobedience,’ of Yas. XXXIII, 4, LIX, 8.

[^14]: (107:6) A personification of the Av. mithaokhta, ‘false-spoken,’ of Yas. LIX, 8, Vend. XIX, 146, Visp. XXIII, 9, Zamyâd Yt. 96.

[^15]: (107:7) TD has drû<i>g</i> gûmânîkîh, ‘the fiend of scepticism.’

[^16]: (107:8) Av. araska of Yas. IX, 18, Râm Yt. 16, personified.

[^17]: (107:9) The word hômanam in K20 is a false Huzvâri<i>s</i> reading of ham, owing to the copyist reading am, ‘I am;’ TD has hamafzâr, ‘having like means.’

[^18]: (107:10) Or Khashm, ‘wrath;’ so written in K20, but it is usually p. 108 Aêshm elsewhere; the Av. aêshma of Vend. IX, 37, X, 23, 27, &c. The Asmodeus of the Book of Tobit appears to be the Av. Aêshmô daêvô, ‘demon of wrath.’

[^19]: (108:1) TD has ‘there were seven powers of Aêshm.’

[^20]: (108:2) TD has ‘six,’ which looks like an unlucky attempt to amend a correct text. Tradition tells us that only five Kayâns reigned (see Chap. XXXIV, 7), and the Shâhnâmah also mentions Sîyâwush (Pahl. Kaî-Sîyâvakhsh), who did not reign; but eight Kayâns, besides Lôharâsp and Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, who were of collateral descent (see Chap. XXXI, 28), are mentioned in the Avesta, whence the author of the Bundahi<i>s</i> would obtain much of his information (see Fravardîn Yt. 132, Zamyâd Yt. 71, 74).

[^21]: (108:3) The phrase in brackets occurs only in TD.

[^22]: (108:4) Reading bunak as in TD; K20 has ‘sends down a root.’

[^23]: (108:5) So in TD; K20 has ‘where Aeshm keeps on.’

[^24]: (108:6) That is, ‘many foreign customs.’

[^25]: (108:7) The word vêsh, ‘most,’ is only in TD.

[^26]: (108:8) So in TD; K20 has Vi<i>g</i>êsh. He is the Av. Vîzaresha of Vend. XIX, 94, who is said to convey the souls of the departed to the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge.

[^27]: (109:1) TD has ‘those three nights,’ referring to the period that the soul is said to remain hovering about the body after death (see Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask, ed. Haug, II, 1-18, III, 1-17).

[^28]: (109:2) So in K20; TD has Aû<i>d</i>ak (see Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 70).

[^29]: (109:3) TD has merely ‘strikes a slipper (pa<i>d</i>în-pôsh) spiritually,’ that is, invisibly, for the purpose of startling the man.

[^30]: (109:4) The short phrases in brackets are taken from TD to supply words torn off from K20, which passes on to Chap. XXIX at this point, but TD supplies a continuation of Chap. XXVIII, which is added here, and enclosed in brackets.

[^31]: (109:5) The Av. Akatasha of Vend. X, 23 Sp., XIX, 43 W.

[^32]: (109:6) See Pahlavi Vend. XVIII, 5, 6.

[^33]: (110:1) A personification of the Av. zaurva of Vend. XIX, 43 W., Yas. IX, 18 Sp., Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 10, Râm Yt. 16.

[^34]: (110:2) The reading of this name is uncertain.

[^35]: (110:3) The small whirlwinds, which usually precede a change of wind in India, are commonly known by the name of shaîTân, which indicates that such whirling columns of dust are popularly attributed to demoniacal agency.

[^36]: (110:4) A personification of Av. varena, ‘desire,’ in an evil sense.

[^37]: (110:5) Av. Bûshyãsta of Vend. XI, 28, 29, 36, 37, XVIII, 38, &c. The names of the three demons in this sentence are Persian words for ‘sloth,’ ‘trouble,’ and ‘want.’

[^38]: (110:6) Av. Âzi of Vend. XVIII, 45, 50, Yas. XVII, 46, LXVII, 22, Â<i>s</i>tâd Yt. 1.

[^39]: (110:7) Compare Pers. payû<i>s</i>, ‘covetous,’ and piyûs, ‘avarice.’ Pû<i>s</i> is evidently the demon of misers, and Âz that of the selfish.

[^40]: (111:1) Av. Nasu of Vend, V, 85-106, VI, 65, 72, 74, 79, VII, 2-27, 70, VIII, 46, 48, 132-228, IX, 49-1 7, &c.

[^41]: (111:2) Av. spazga of Ardabahi<i>s</i>t Yt. 8, 11, 15.

[^42]: (111:3) Always written like anâst.

[^43]: (111:4) Av. aghashi of Vend. XX, 14, 20, 24, which appears to be ‘the evil eye;’ but see § 36.

[^44]: (111:5) Av. Bûiti of Vend. XIX, 4, 6, 140, who must be identified with Pers. but, ‘an idol,’ Sans. bhûta, ‘a goblin,’ and not with Buddha.

[^45]: (111:6) Reading afa<i>s</i> vakhsh pavan bûtîhâ mâhmânŏ, <i>k</i>îgûn bût asp parastê<i>d</i>ŏ, which evidently admits of many variations, but the meaning is rather obscure.

[^46]: (111:7) Here written Astî-vîdâ<i>d</i> (see Chap. III, 21). Vend. V, 25, 31 says, ‘Astô-vîdhôtu binds him (the dying, man); Vayô (the flying demon) conveys him bound;’ from which it would appear that Astî-vîdâ<i>d</i> and ‘the evil flyer’ were originally considered as distinct demons.

[^47]: (112:1) Av. Apaosha of Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 21, 22, 27, 28, Â<i>s</i>tâd Yt. 2, 6; see also Chap. VII, 8, 10, 12.

[^48]: (112:2) Here written Aspen<i>g</i>arôgâ, but see Chaps. VII, 12, XVII, 1. He is the Av. Spen<i>g</i>aghra of Vend. XIX, 135, and, being a demon, is not to be confounded with the demon-worshipper, Spi<i>n</i><i>g</i>auru<i>s</i>ka, of Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 31, Ashi Yt. 51.

[^49]: (112:3) The ‘evil spirit,’ Ganrâk-maînôk, seems to be here treated as a demon distinct from Aharman, which is inconsistent with what is stated in §§ 1-6, and is contrary to general opinion. This inconsistency would indicate the possibility of this continuation of Chap. XXVIII in TD, or a portion of it, having been added by an editor in later times (although it is difficult to discover any difference of style in the language), if we did not find a similar confusion of the two names in Chap. XXX, 29, 30.

[^50]: (113:1) Compare Mkh. XL, 24-28: ‘The one wish that Hôrmezd, the lord, desires from men is this, that “ye shall understand me (Hôrmezd), since every one who shall understand me comes after me, and strives for my satisfaction.” And the one wish that Aharman desires from men is this, that “ye shall not understand me (Aharman), since whoever shall understand me wicked, _his_ actions proceed not after me, and, moreover, no advantage and friendship come to me from that man.”’

[^51]: (113:2) The sentence is rather obscure, but it seems to imply that such cries keep the evil spirit at a distance; it is, however, just possible that it means that the cry of the evil spirit can be heard as far as such cries.

[^52]: (113:3) Av. Kunda of Vend. XI, 28, 36, XIX, 138.

[^53]: (113:4) TD has Gôk-<i>k</i>ihar and Mû<i>s</i>\-parîk here, but see Chap. V, 1, where these beings are included among the seven planetary leaders, and not counted in addition to them. This is another inconsistency which leads to the suspicion that this continuation of the chapter may have been written by a later hand. According to this later view, the sun and moon must be included among those malevolent orbs, the planets.

[^54]: (114:1) Compare Mkh. VII, 31: ‘and always their darkness is suchlike as though it be possible to grasp with the hand.’

[^55]: (114:2) Compare Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf-nâmak (LIV, 5-8): '_As close_ as the ear to the eye, and as many as the hairs on the mane of a horse, so _close and_ many in number, the souls of the wicked stand, but they see not, and hear no sound, one from the other; every one thinks thus, “I am alone.”.

[^56]: (114:3) Or, ‘with more cold than Saturn.’
