## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. On the chieftainship of men and animals _and_ every single thing it says in revelation, that first of the human species Gâyômar<i>d</i> was produced, brilliant and white, with eyes which looked out for the great _one_, him who _was_ here the Zaratû<i>s</i>trôtûm (chief high-priest); the chieftainship of all things was from Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^1]. 2. The white ass-goat [^2], which holds _its_ head down, is the chief of goats, the first of those species created [^3]. 3. The black sheep which is fat and white-jawed is the chief of sheep; it was the first of those species created [^3]. 4. The camel with white-haired knees _and_ two humps is the chief of camels. 5. First the black-haired ox with yellow knees was created; he is the chief of oxen. 6. First the dazzling white (arûs) horse, with yellow ears, glossy hair, _and_ white eyes, was produced; he is the chief of horses. 7. The white, cat-footed [^4] ass is the chief of asses. 8. First of dogs the fair (arûs) dog with yellow hair was produced; he is the chief of dogs. 9. The hare was produced brown <span id="p89"><sup><small>[ p. 89 ]</small></sup></span> (bûr); he is the chief of the wide-travellers. 10. Those beasts which have no dread whatever of the hand are evil. 11. First of birds the griffon of three natures [^5] was created, not for here (this world), for the Kar<i>s</i>ipt [^6] is the chief, which they call the falcon (<i>k</i>ark), that which revelation says was brought to the enclosure formed by Yim. 12. First of fur animals the white ermine was produced; he is the chief of fur animals; as it says that _it is_ the white ermine which came unto the assembly of the archangels. 13. The Kar-fish, _or_ Ari<i>z</i> [^7], is the chief of the water-creatures. 14. The Dâîtîk [^8] river is the chief of streams. 15. The Dâra<i>g</i>a [^9] river is the chief of exalted rivers, for the dwelling of the father of Zaratû<i>s</i>t was on its banks [^10], _and_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t was born there. 16. The hoary forest [^11] is the chief of forests. 17. Hûgar the lofty [^12], on which the water of Arêdvîvsûr flows _and_ leaps, is the chief of summits, since _it is that_ above which is the revolution of the constellation Satavês [^13], the chief of <span id="p90"><sup><small>[ p. 90 ]</small></sup></span> reservoirs [^14]. 18. The Hôm which is out-squeezed is the chief of medicinal plants [^15]. 19. Wheat is the chief of large-seeded [^16] grains. 20. The desert wormwood is the chief of unmedicinal [^17] _plants_. 21. The summer vetch, which they also call ‘pag’ (gâvirs), is the chief of small-seeded grains [^18]. 22. The Kûstîk (sacred thread-girdle) is the chief of clothes. 23. The Bâzâyvâna [^19] is the chief of seas. 24. Of two men, when they come forward together, the wiser and more truthful is chief.

25\. This, too, it says in revelation, that Aûharmazd created the whole material world one abode, so that all may be one; for there is much splendour and glory of industry in the world. 26. Whatsoever he performs, who practises that which is good, is the value of the water of life [^20]; since water is not created alike [^21] in value, for the undefiled water of Arêdvîvsûr is worth the whole water of the sky and earth of Khvanîras [^22], except the Arag river [^23], created by Aûharmazd. 27. Of trees the myrtle _and_ date, <span id="p91"><sup><small>[ p. 91 ]</small></sup></span> on which _model_, it is said, trees were formed, are worth all the trees of Khvanîras, except the Gôkar<i>d</i> tree [^24] with which they restore the dead.

28\. Of mountains Mount Apârsên's beginning is _in_ Sagastân _and_ end in Khû<i>g</i>îstân, some say _it is_ all the mountains of Pârs, _and_ is chief of all mountains except Albûr<i>z</i>. 29. Of birds <i>K</i>amrô<i>s</i> [^25] is chief, who is worth all the birds in Khvanîras, except the griffon of three natures. 30. The conclusion is this, that every one who performs a great duty has then much value.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (88:1) So in all MSS., but by reading mûn, ‘who,’ instead of min, ‘from,’ we should have, ‘him who was here the chief high-priest and chieftainship of all things, who was Zaratû<i>s</i>t.’ The Pahlavi Visp. I. 1, gives the following list of chiefs: ‘The chief of spirits is Aûharmazd, the chief of worldly existences is Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the chief of water-creatures is the Kar-fish, the chief of _land_\-animals is the ermine, the chief of flying-creatures is the Kar<i>s</i>ipt, the chief of the wide-travellers is the . . . , the chief of those suitable for grazing is the ass-goat.’

[^2]: (88:2) See Chap. XIV, 14.

[^3]: (88:3) It is doubtful whether the phrase, ‘the first of those species created,’ belongs to this sentence or the following one.

[^4]: (88:4) Or, ‘cat-legged.’

[^5]: (89:1) The Sîmurgh (see § 29 and Chap. XIV, 11, 23, 24). In Mkh. LXII, 37-39, it is mentioned as follows: ‘And Sînamrû’s resting-place is on the tree which is opposed to harm, of all seeds; and always when he rises aloft a thousand twigs will shoot forth from that tree; and when he alights he will break off the thousand twigs, and he sheds their seed therefrom.'

[^6]: (89:2) See Chap. XIX, 16. In § 29 <i>K</i>amrô<i>s</i> is said to be the chief.

[^7]: (89:3) See Chaps. XIV, 12, 26, XVIII, 3-6.

[^8]: (89:4) See Chap. XX, 13

[^9]: (89:5) See Chap. XX, 32.

[^10]: (89:6) The MSS. have ‘in Balkh’ instead of ‘on the banks.’

[^11]: (89:7) The arûs-i razur is the Av. spaêtitem razurem of Râm Yt. 31.

[^12]: (89:8) See Chap. XII, 5.

[^13]: (89:9) See Chap. II, 7.

[^14]: (90:1) The meaning of Pâz. gobarâ is doubtful, but it is here taken as standing for Pahl. gôbalân, equivalent to the plural of Pers. gôl or kôl, ‘a reservoir;’ Satavês being a specially ‘watery’ constellation (see Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 0). Justi traces gobarân to Av. gufra, and translates it by ‘protecting _stars_.’

[^15]: (90:2) Pâz. khvad and ba<i>k</i>agâ evidently stand for Pahl. hû<i>d</i> (Av. huta) and be<i>z</i>ashk.

[^16]: (90:3) Compare Av. as-dânunãm-<i>k</i>a yavananãm (Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 29).

[^17]: (90:4) Pâz. aba<i>k</i>agâ stands for Pahl. abe<i>z</i>ashk.

[^18]: (90:5) Compare Av. kasu-dânunãm-<i>k</i>a vâstranãm (Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 29).

[^19]: (90:6) Justi identifies this with Lake Van, but perhaps Lake Sevan may be meant.

[^20]: (90:7) Or, ‘its value is water.’ K20 omits the word ‘water.’

[^21]: (90:8) Reading ham instead of hamâk, ‘all.’

[^22]: (90:9) See Chap. XI, 2-6.

[^23]: (90:10) See Chap. XX, 8.

[^24]: (91:1) See Chap. XVIII, 1-4.

[^25]: (91:2) See Chap. XIX, 115, where it is written <i>K</i>âmrô<i>s</i>. This § is at variance with § 11, which gives the chieftainship to Kar<i>s</i>ipt.
