## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXII.

1\. On the nature of lakes it says in revelation, that thus many fountains of waters have come into notice, which they call lakes (var); counterparts of the eyes (<i>k</i>ashm) of men are those fountains (<i>k</i>ashmak) of waters; such as Lake <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast, Lake Sôvbar, Lake Khvâri<i>z</i>em [^1], Lake Frazdân, Lake Zarînmand, Lake Âsvast, Lake Husru, Lake Satavês, Lake Urvis.

2\. I _will_ mention them also a second time: Lake <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast [^2] is in Âtarô-pâtakân, warm is the water _and_ opposed to harm, so that nothing whatever is living in _it_; and its source is connected with the wide-formed ocean [^3]. 3. Lake Sôvbar is in the upper district and country on the summit of the mountain of Tûs [^4]; as it says, that the Sû<i>d</i>\-bâhar [^5] (‘share of benefit’) is propitious and good from which abounding <span id="p86"><sup><small>[ p. 86 ]</small></sup></span> liberality is produced. 4. Regarding Lake Khvâri<i>z</i>em [^6] it says that excellent benefit is produced from it, _that is_, Arshi<i>s</i>ang [^7] the rich in wealth, the well-portioned _with_ abounding pleasure. 5. Lake Frazdân [^8] is in Sagastân; they say, where a generous man, _who is_ righteous, throws anything into it, it receives _it_; when not righteous, it throws _it_ out again; its source also is connected with the wide-formed _ocean_. 6. Lake Zarînmand is in Hama<i>d</i>ân [^9]. 7. Regarding Lake Âsvast it is declared that the undefiled [^10] water which it contains is always constantly flowing into the sea, so bright and copious [^11] that _one_ might say that the sun had come into it _and_ looked at Lake Âsvast, into that water which is requisite for restoring the dead in the renovation _of the universe_. 8. Lake Husru [^12] is within fifty [^13]

<span id="p87"><sup><small>[ p. 87 ]</small></sup></span>

leagues (parasang). of Lake <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast. 9. Lake (or, rather, Gulf) Satavês [^14] is that _already_ written _about_, between the wide-formed ocean _and_ the Pûtîk. 10. It is said that in Kamîndân is an abyss (zafar), from which everything they throw in always comes _back_, and it _will_ not receive it unless alive (<i>g</i>ânvar); when they throw a living creature into it, it carries _it_ down; men say that a fountain from hell is in it. 11. Lake Urvis is on Hûgar the lofty [^15].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (85:3) Pâz. Khvârazm both here and in § 4.

[^2]: (85:4) Av. <i>K</i>aê<i>k</i>asta of Âbân Yt. 49, Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 18, 21, 22, Ashi Yt. 38, 41, Sîrôz. 9. The present Lake Urumiyah in Âdarbî<i>g</i>ân, which is called Khe<i>g</i>est, or <i>K</i>e<i>g</i>est, by ’Hamdu-l-lâh Mustaûfî.

[^3]: (85:5) Implying that the water is salt.

[^4]: (85:6) The Kôndrâsp mountain (see Chap. XII, 24). This lake is probably a small sheet of water on the mountains near Meshhed.

[^5]: (85:7) Evidently a punning etymology of the name of this lake.

[^6]: (86:1) The province of Khvâri<i>z</i>em was between the Aral and Caspian, along the ancient course of the Oxus (see Chap. XVII, 5). This lake has been identified with the Aral.

[^7]: (86:2) Av. ashi<i>s</i> vanguhi, ‘good rectitude,’ personified as a female angel whose praises are celebrated in the Ashi Ya<i>s</i>t; in later times she has been considered as the angel dispensing wealth and possessions. She is also called Ar<i>d</i> (Av. areta, which is synonymous with asha), see Chap. XXVII, 24.

[^8]: (86:3) The ‘Frazdânava water’ of Âbân Yt. 108 and Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk, p. 17. Justi identifies it with the Âb-istâdah (‘standing water’) lake, south of Ghaznî. It is here represented as a salt lake.

[^9]: (86:4) K20 adds, ‘they say.’ This lake cannot be the spring Zarînmand of Chap. XX, 34.

[^10]: (86:5) Pâz. avnasti transcribed into Pahlavi is avinastag, ‘unspoiled,’ the equivalent of Av. anâhita in Yas. LXIV, 1, 16, Visp. I, 18.

[^11]: (86:6) K20 has ‘glorious’ as a gloss to ‘copious.’

[^12]: (86:7) The Av. Haosravangha of Sîroz. 9, ‘the lake which is named Husrav<i>a</i>u’ of Zamyâd Yt. 56. It may be either Lake Van or Lake Sevan, which are nearly equidistant from Lake Urumiyah.

[^13]: (86:8) M6 has ‘four leagues.’

[^14]: (87:1) See Chap. XIII, 9-13.

[^15]: (87:2) See Chaps. XII, 5, XIII, 4.
