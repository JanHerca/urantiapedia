## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXXII [^1]

1\. On the kindred of Pôrûshasp [^2], _son_ of Paîtirâsp [^3], _son_ of Aurvadasp [^4], _son_ of Hâê<i>k</i>a<i>d</i>âsp [^5], _son_ of <span id="p141"><sup><small>[ p. 141 ]</small></sup></span> <i>K</i>akhshnû<i>s</i> [^6], _son_ of Pâîtîrasp, _son_ of Hardar<i>s</i>n [^7], _son_ of Hardâr [^8], _son_ of Spîtâmân [^9], _son_ of Vîda<i>s</i>t [^10], _son_ of Ayazem, _son_ of Ra<i>g</i>an [^11], _son_ of Dûrâsrôb [^12], _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^13]. 2. As Paîtirâsp _had_ two sons, one Pôrûshasp _and_ one Ârâsti [^14], by Pôrûshasp was Zaratû<i>s</i>t begotten for a sanctuary of good religion [^15], _and_ by Ârâsti was Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh [^16] begotten. 3. Zaratû<i>s</i>t, when he brought the religion, first celebrated <span id="p142"><sup><small>[ p. 142 ]</small></sup></span> worship [^17] _and_ expounded in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, and Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh received the religion from him. 4. The Môbads [^18] of Pârs are all _traced_ back to this race of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar.

5\. Again, I say, by Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^19] _were_ begotten three sons and three daughters [^20]; one _son was_ Isa<i>d</i>vâstar [^21], one Aûrvata<i>d</i>\-nar [^22], _and_ one Khûrshê<i>d</i>\-<i>k</i>îhar [^23]; as Isa<i>d</i>vâstar _was_ chief of the priests he became the Môbad of Môbads, _and_ passed away in the hundredth year of the religion; Aûrvata<i>d</i>\-nar _was_ an agriculturist, _and_ the chief of the enclosure formed by Yim [^24], which is below the earth; Khûrshê<i>d</i>\-<i>k</i>îhar _was_ a warrior, commander of the army of Pêshyôtanû, _son_ of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, _and_ dwells in Kangde<i>z</i> [^24]; _and_ of the three daughters the name of one was Frên, of one Srît, _and_ of one Pôru<i>k</i>îst [^25]. 6. Aûrvata<i>d</i>\-nar and Khûrshê<i>d</i>\-<i>k</i>îhar were from a serving (<i>k</i>akar) wife [^26], the rest were from a privileged (pâ<i>d</i>akhshah) wife. <span id="p143"><sup><small>[ p. 143 ]</small></sup></span> 7 [^27]. By Isa<i>d</i>vâstar was begotten a son _whose_ name was Ururvi<i>g</i>a [^28], and they call him Aran<i>g</i>\-i Bîrâ<i>d</i>ân [^29] (‘fore-arm of brothers’) for this reason, that, as they <span id="p144"><sup><small>[ p. 144 ]</small></sup></span> were from a serving wife, _she_ then delivered them over to Isa<i>d</i>vâstar through adoption. 8. This, too, _one_ knows, that three sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _namely_, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh [^30], and Sôshyans [^31], were from Hvôv [^32]; as it says, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t went near unto Hvôv three times, _and_ each time the seed went to the ground; the angel Nêryôsang [^33] received the brilliance and strength of that seed, delivered _it_ with care to the angel Anâhî<i>d</i> [^34], _and_ in time will blend _it_ with a mother. 9. Nine thousand, nine hundred, and ninety-nine, and nine myriads [^35] of the guardian spirits of the righteous are intrusted with _its_ protection, so that the demons may not injure _it_ [^36].

10\. The name of the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t was Dughdâ [^37], _and_ the name of the father of the mother, of Zaratû<i>s</i>t was Frahimravâ [^38].

[^3]: (140:8) K20 has Pâz. Spitarsp, and M6 has Pâz. Piruasp (see note on Chap. XXXIII, 1). The reading in the text is doubtful.

[^4]: (140:9) Omitted in K20 and TD.

[^5]: (140:10) Av. Haê<i>k</i>a<i>d</i>aspa of Yas. XLI, 15, LII, 3.

[^6]: (141:1) Windischmann suggests Av. <i>K</i>âkhshnôi<i>s</i> (gen.) of Fravardîn Yt. 114.

[^7]: (141:2) K20 has Pâz. Har<i>s</i>n and TD has Harakî<i>d</i>ârsnŏ.

[^8]: (141:3) TD has Harâî<i>d</i>âr, or Arâî<i>d</i>âr.

[^9]: (141:4) Or Spîtâm (as the last syllable is the patronymical suffix), Av. Spitâma, the usual patronymic of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

[^10]: (141:5) May be read Vâdi<i>s</i>t in TD.

[^11]: (141:6) Possibly the same person as Râk in Chap. XXXI, 31; but see XXXIII, 3.

[^12]: (141:7) So in TD, but Pâz. Durâsrun in K20, M6.

[^13]: (141:8) This genealogy is somewhat differently given in the Va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>\-i Dînîk (pp. 28, 29), as published in Bombay by Dastur Peshotanji Behramji Sanjânâ in 1848; and is extended back, through the generations mentioned in Chap. XXXI, 1, 2, 7, 14, to Gâyômar<i>d</i>, as follows: ‘Pôrûshâspô _son_ of Paîtîrâsp, _and_ Arâspô son of Paîtîrâsp, Urva<i>n</i>dasp, Haê<i>k</i>a<i>d</i>asp, <i>K</i>ikhshnu<i>s</i>, Paêtirasp, Hardr<i>s</i>n, Haridâr, Spîtâmânŏ, Vaêdi<i>s</i>t, Nayâzem, Ra<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>n, Dûrâsrôb, Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar sovereign of Iran, Mânu<i>s</i>\-khûrnar, Mânu<i>s</i>\-khûrnâk, Nêryôsang, Var<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>\-dîn, Vîzak, Airyak, Aithritak, Ibitak, Frazî<i>s</i>ak, Zi<i>s</i>ak, Frasizak, Izak, Aîrî<i>k</i>, Frê<i>d</i>ûn lord of Khvanîras, Pûr-tôrâ the Âspîkân, Nêvak-tôrâ the Âspîkân, Sôg-tôrâ the Âspîkân, Gêfar-tôrâ the Âspîkân, Vanô-i-fravi<i>s</i>n the Âspîkân, Yim lord of the seven regions, Vîvanghâû, Ayangha<i>d</i>, Anangha<i>d</i>, Takhmôrup, Hôshâng the Pê<i>s</i>dâ<i>d</i>, lord of the seven regions, Fravâk, Sîyâmak, Mashyô whose wife was Mashyãk, Gâyôkmar<i>d</i> the first man, and father of all mankind in the material world.’

[^14]: (141:9) Av. Âkrâstaya of Fravardîn Yt. 95; TD has Ârâstih.

[^15]: (141:10) The Pâzand words dargâ hidaini<i>s</i> appear to be merely a misreading of Pahl. dargâs-i hûdînôîh.

[^16]: (141:11) Av. Maidhyô-m<i>a</i>ungha of Yas. L, 19, Fravardîn Yt. 95, 106. He is said to have been Zaratû<i>s</i>t's first disciple.

[^17]: (142:1) Reading frâ<i>g</i> ya<i>s</i>t; but it may be frâ<i>g</i> ga<i>s</i>t, ‘wandered forth.’

[^18]: (142:2) The class of priests whose special duty is to perform all religious rites and ceremonies.

[^19]: (142:3) This paragraph is quoted, with a few alterations, in the Va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>\-i Dînîk, pp. 21-23.

[^20]: (142:4) K20 omits the ‘three daughters’ here, by mistake.

[^21]: (142:5) Av. Isa<i>d</i>\-vâstra of Yas. XXIII, 4, XXVI, 17, Fravardîn Yt. 98.

[^22]: (142:6) Av. Urvata<i>d</i>\-nara of Vend. II, 143, Fravardîn Yt. 98. K20 and A16 have Aûrvarta<i>d</i>\-nar, and TD has Aûrvâta<i>d</i>\-nar.

[^23]: (142:7) Av. Hvare-<i>k</i>ithra of Fravardîn Yt. 98; TD has Khûr-<i>k</i>îhar.

[^24]: (142:8) See Chap. XXIX, 5. Windischmann and Justi consider the clause about Pêshyôtanû as inserted by mistake, and it is omitted in the Va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>\-i Dînîk (p. 21); it is found, however, in all MSS. of the Bundahi<i>s</i>.

[^25]: (142:9) These daughters are the Av. Fr<i>e</i>ni, Thriti, and Pouru-<i>k</i>ista of Fravardîn Yt. 139; the last is also mentioned in Yas. LII, 3.

[^26]: (142:10) The following is a summary of the Persian descriptions of the five kinds of marriage, as given in the Rivâyats:—
  A pâdshâh (‘ruling, or privileged’) wife is when a man marries, p. 143 with the parents' consent, an unbetrothed maiden out of a family, and she and her children remain his in both worlds.
  A yûkan or ayûk (‘only child’) wife is an only child, married with the parents’ consent, and her first child belongs to them; after its birth she becomes a pâdshâh wife. She is entitled to one-third of her parents' property for giving up the child.
  A satar (‘adopted’) wife is when a man over fifteen years of age dies childless and unmarried, and his relatives provide a maiden with a dowry, and marry her to another man; when half her children belong to, the dead man, and half to the living, and she herself is the dead man's wife in the other world.
  A <i>k</i>akar or <i>k</i>âkar (‘serving’) wife is a widow who marries again; if she had no children by her first husband she is acting as a satar wife, and half her children by her second husband belong to her first one; and she herself, in any case, belongs to her first husband in the other world.
  A khûd-<i>s</i>arâî or khûd-sarâî (‘self-disposing’) wife is one who marries without her parents’ consent; she inherits no property from her parents until her eldest son has given her as a pâdshâh wife to his father.

[^27]: (143:1) Instead of this sentence the Va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>\-i Dînîk (pp. 21, 22) has the following, which appears to rest upon a misinterpretation of the text:—
  ‘And Zaratû<i>s</i>t the righteous had three wives; all three were in the lifetime of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and all three wives were living throughout the lifetime of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; the name of one was Hvôv, of the second Urvi<i>g</i>, of the third Arni<i>g</i>\-baredâ. And from Urvi<i>g</i>, who was a privileged wife, four children were born; one was the son Isa<i>d</i>vâstar, and the three daughters, namely, Frên, Srîtak, and Pôru<i>k</i>ist; these four were from Urvi<i>g</i>. And from the wife Arni<i>g</i>\-baredâ two sons were born, one Aûrvart-nar, and the second Khûrshêd-<i>k</i>îhar; and Arni<i>g</i>\-baredâ was a serving wife, and the name of the former husband of Arni<i>g</i>\-baredâ was Mitrô-ayâr. And from Hvôv, who was a privileged wife, _were_ three sons, namely, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, and Sôshâns, as it says,’ &c. (as in § 8).

[^28]: (143:2) TD has Pahl. Aûrvarvî<i>g</i>ak or Khûrûrûpak.

[^29]: (143:3) So in TD.

[^30]: (144:1) Av. Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-ereta and Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-nemangh of Fravardîn Yt. 128.

[^31]: (144:2) Av. Saoshyãs of Vend. XIX, 18, Fravardîn Yt. 129, &c. See Chaps. XI, 6, XXIX, 6, XXX, 3, 4, 7, 17, 25, 27.

[^32]: (144:3) Av. Hvôvi of Fravardîn Yt. 139, Dîn Yt. 15; the Pahlavi form of the name, as given once in TD, is Hûvâôbŏ.

[^33]: (144:4) See Chap. XV, 1.

[^34]: (144:5) Av. anâhita of Âbân Yt. 1, &c.; a female personification of ‘unsullied’ water, known generally by the epithet ardvî sûra (the Arêdvîvsûr of Chap. XIII), and whose name is also applied to the planet Venus (see Chap. V, 1).

[^35]: (144:6) So in M6; other MSS. have ‘9,999 myriads,’ but see Fravardîn Yt. 62.

[^36]: (144:7) This last phrase, about the demons, is omitted in TD and the Va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>\-i Dînîk.

[^37]: (144:8) The Avesta word for ‘daughter.’

[^38]: (144:9) TD has Pâz. Fereâhimruvânâ.
