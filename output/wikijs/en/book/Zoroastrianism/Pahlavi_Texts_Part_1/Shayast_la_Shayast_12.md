## SHAYÂST LA-SHAYÂST. CHAPTER XII.

1\. The rule is this, that when one's _form of_ worship (ya<i>s</i>t) [^4] is performed, and it is not possible for him to prepare _it_, the practice of those of the primitive faith [^5] is, when the girdle (aîpiyâûng) is twined about a _sacred_ twig-bundle (baresôm) [^6] of seven twigs (tâk), to consecrate a sacred cake (drônô) thrice, which becomes his _form of_ worship that is performed one degree better through the sacred cake; and of the merit of a threefold _consecration_ <span id="p339"><sup><small>[ p. 339 ]</small></sup></span> _of the_ sacred cake the high-priests _have_ specially taught, in the Hûspâram _Nask_ [^1], that _it_ is as much as _that_ of a lesser _form of_ worship.

2\. The rule is this, that he who is himself more acquainted with religion is he who considers him who is more acquainted with religion than himself as high-priest, and considers _him_ as high-priest [^2] so that he may not destroy the bridge of the soul [^3]; as it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm _Nask_ [^4] that no one of them, that is an inattentive (asrûshdâr) man who has no high-priest, attains to the best existence [^5], not though his recitations should be so many that they have made his duty and good works as much as the verdure (sapdak) of the plants when it shoots forth in spring, the verdure which Aûharmazd _has_ given abundantly.

3\. The rule is this, that they keep a fire [^6] in the house, because, from not keeping the fire properly, _there_ arise less pregnancy of women and a weeping (â<i>v</i>\-dî<i>d</i>anŏ) for the loss of strength (tanû) of men [^7]; and the chilled charcoal (angi<i>s</i>t) and the rest which are without advantage (bar) are to be <span id="p340"><sup><small>[ p. 340 ]</small></sup></span> carried away from the fire; and in the Spend _Nask_ [^1] _it_ is revealed that a fire, when they shall make it quite clean from its chilled charcoal, _has_ as much comfort as a man whose clothing they should make clean.

4\. The rule is this, that when any one passes away it is proper to render useless [^2] as much as the smallest mouth-veil [^3], for it says, in the Vendidad [^4] that ‘if even those Mazdayasnians should leave on him who is dead, in parting with him, as much as that which a damsel would leave in parting with the _food_\-bowl (pa<i>d</i>mânakŏ)—that is, a bag (anbânakŏ-hanâ) [^5]’—the decree is this, that _it_ is a Tanâpûhar <span id="p341"><sup><small>[ p. 341 ]</small></sup></span> _sin_ [^1] at root, which is hell; _and_ in the Vendidad [^2] it says that the clothing of the charitable (dahi<i>s</i>n-hômand) soul, and even the clothing which they will give _it_, are out of almsgivings (dâsarân) [^3].

5\. The rule is this, that when any one passes away after keeping fasting the three _nights_ [^4], still the presentation of holy-water (zôhar) to the fire is to be performed, which is the presenting of the holy-water to the nearest fire; for in the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> _Nask_ [^5] _it_ is revealed that when they sever (tebrûnd) the consciousness of men it goes out to the nearest fire, then out to the stars, then out to the <span id="p342"><sup><small>[ p. 342 ]</small></sup></span> moon, and then out to the sun [^1]; and _it_ is needful that the nearest fire, which is that to which it _has_ come out, should become stronger (zôr-hômand-tar) [^2].

6\. The rule is this, that they should not leave a nail-_paring_ unprayed over (anâfsû<i>d</i>ak), for if it be not prayed over (afsând) [^3] it turns into the arms _and_ equipments of the Mâzanân demons [^4]; _this_ is explicitly shown in the Vendidad [^5].

7\. The rule is this, that the labour of child-birth [^6] is not to be accomplished at night, except while with the light of a fire, or the stars and moon, upon _it_; for great opposition is connected with it, and in the twentieth of the Hûspâram _Nask_ [^7] it is shown _that_ over the soul of him who works in the dark _there is_ more predominance of the evil spirit.

8\. The rule is this, that they should allow the egg and other food [^8] for those gifts _and_ favours of the <span id="p343"><sup><small>[ p. 343 ]</small></sup></span> sovereign moon (mâh-i khû<i>d</i>âî) and the other angels; if so, it is to be allowed by them thus: ‘I will consecrate so much food for such an angel,’ and not thus: ‘One sacred cake (drônô) in so much food.’ 9. And the reason of it is this, that _they_ who shall allow thus: ‘One sacred cake out of so much food,’ and of which _it_ is one thing less, even though _one_ shall consecrate _it_ many times, still then he _has_ not repaid; and _they_ who should allow thus: ‘I will consecrate so much food for such an angel,’ though _one_ shall reverence _him_ with many sacred cakes, it is proper. 10. And in the twenty-two _sections_ of the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm _Nask_ [^1] grievous things are shown about those who do not make offerings (aûstôfrî<i>d</i>) unto the angels.

11\. The rule is this, that when a woman becomes pregnant, as long as it is possible, a fire _one_ cares for well is to be maintained in the house, because it is revealed [^2] in the Spend Nask that _to_ Dûkdâv [^3], the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, when she was pregnant with Zaratû<i>s</i>t, for three nights, every night a leader (shâh) [^4] with a hundred and fifty demons came for the destruction of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and yet, owing to the existence of the fire in the dwelling, they knew no means _for it_.

<span id="p344"><sup><small>[ p. 344 ]</small></sup></span>

12\. The rule is this, where a child is born, _during_ three days, for protection from demons, wizards, and witches, a fire is to be made at night until day_light_, and is to be maintained there in the day, and pure incense is to be put upon it, as is revealed in the thirtieth of the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm _Nask_ [^1].

13\. The rule is this [^2], that from a toothpick the bark [^3] is to be well cut off, for there are _some_ of those of the primitive faith [^4] who _have_ said that, when [^5] they shall make it for the teeth _with_ the bark on, and they throw _it_ away, a pregnant woman, who puts a foot upon it, is doubtful about _its_ being dead matter.

14\. The rule is this, that _it_ is well _if any one of_ those who have their handmaid (<i>k</i>akar) in cohabitation (zanîh), and offspring is born of her, shall accept all those who are male as sons; _but_ those who are female are no advantage, because an adopted _son_ (satôr) is requisite, and in the fourteenth of the Hûspâram _Nask_ [^6] the high-priests <span id="p345"><sup><small>[ p. 345 ]</small></sup></span> _have_ taught thus: ‘My son is suitable also as thy son, _but_ my daughter is not suitable also as thy daughter;’ and _there_ are many who [^1] do not appoint an adopted _son with_ this idea, that: ‘The child of a handmaid may be accepted by us as a son.’

15\. The rule is this, that _one is_ to persevere much in the begetting of offspring, since _it is_ for the acquisition [^2] of many good works at once; because in the Spend [^3] and Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm Nasks [^4] the high-priests _have_ taught that the duty and good works which a son performs are as much the father‘s as though they had been done by his own hand; and in the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> _Nask_ [^5], it is revealed thus: ’Likewise, too, the good works, _in_ like manner, which come _to_ the father as his own.'

18\. The rule is this, that what they shall give to the worthy is as much as is proper and beyond, for eating _and_ accumulating; because in the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm _Nask_ [^6] the high-priests _have_ taught thus: ‘When a man gives bread to a man, even though that man _has_ too much bread, all the good works, which he shall perform through that superabundance, become as much his _who gave it_ as though they had been done by his own hand.’

17\. The rule is this, that in the night water is <span id="p346"><sup><small>[ p. 346 ]</small></sup></span> not to be drawn [^1] from a well, as in the Bâg-yasnô [^2] notice is given about the uncleanness (ayo<i>s</i>dâsarîh) of well-water at night.

18\. The rule is this, that in the night anything eatable is not to be cast away to the north, because a fiend _will_ become pregnant; and when it is cast away one Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^3] is to be uttered. 19. Those of the primitive faith [^4] who _used_ to act more orthodoxically (hû-rastakîhâtar), when food _was_ eaten by them in the night, for the sake of preservation from sin owing to the coming of strainings _and_ sprinklings _on_ to the ground, directed a man to chant the Ahunavar [^5] from the beginning of the feast <span id="p347"><sup><small>[ p. 347 ]</small></sup></span> (myazd) unto the end, more especially at the feast of the season-festivals; as it says in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht _Nask_ [^1], that of the sayings which are spoken out the Ahunavar is that _which is_ most triumphant.

20\. The rule is this, that when _one_ sees a hedgehog he takes _it_ back to the plain, and its own place is to be preserved free from danger; for in the Vendidad the high-priests _have_ taught, that every day, when the hedgehog voids urine into an ant's nest, a thousand ants will die [^2].

21\. The rule is this, that some who are of the good religion _say_, where _one_ is washing _his_ face, one Ashem-vohû [^3] is always to be uttered, _and_ that Ashem-vohû is to be uttered before the _washing_; for when he utters _it_ while washing _his_ face, _he_ is doubtful (var-hômand) about the water coming to _his_ mouth.

22\. The rule is this, that they select from the purifiers [^4]—when their business (mindavam) is as important (rabâ) as purity and impurity—_him_ with whom the control [^5] of ablution (pâ<i>d</i>îyâ<i>v</i>îh) [^6], and non-ablution is connected; they select _him_ especially <span id="p348"><sup><small>[ p. 348 ]</small></sup></span> with regard to the good disposition and truthful speaking of the man, and _to_ the particular work; and on account of _his being_, in innocence _he_ is to be considered more righteous. 23. As in the Vendidad [^1] it says, about the two shares of righteousness, how _one_ should tell that _he is_ ‘a righteous man, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! who is a purifier, who should be a speaker that speaks truly, an enquirer of the _sacred_ texts—that is, he has performed his ritual (ya<i>s</i>t)—a righteous _one_ who specially understands purification from the religion of the Mazdayasnians, that is, he understands its _religious_ formulas (nîrang).’ 24. When _it_ is so that the control of their ablution is connected with him, so that they consider what _pertains_ to the _purifying_ bowl (zak-i tâ<i>s</i>tîk) as his, and ever abstain from it, though the angels hear and consider _them_ as clean, and they select for him those who consecrate the water and bull's urine (gômê<i>z</i>) on account of _their_ control, of purification (yô<i>s</i>dâsarkarîh), _and it_ is to be performed very observantly by the consecrators at the place which is to be measured with a measure and very exactly (khûptar) [^2]. 25. And the purifier is so much the better when washed again, and when _it is_ by some one through whose periodic (zamânîk) <span id="p349"><sup><small>[ p. 349 ]</small></sup></span> care _he_ is thus done; for in the periodic interval many secret [^1] kinds of pollution are produced. 26. Of the celebrators of the Vendidad the good are _they_ who shall again perform the Navashâ<i>d</i>ar rite [^2]; for, on account of the same nicety (nâ<i>z</i>ûkîh) which is written above by me, _and_ on account of much also _that is_ secret, which has happened _and_ mostly arises about it, _there_ is no harm from performing _it_. 27: And _any one_ of those who shall receive the water and bull‘s urine _it_ is very important to wash beforehand (pavan pê<i>s</i>) [^3]; because, if _there_ be impurity _about_ him [^4], _and_ he puts a hand to the cup (<i>g</i>âmak), the water, _and_ the bull’s urine, _they_ are unclean (apâ<i>d</i>â<i>v</i>ŏ) [^5]; when _it is_ so that _there_ be some one, when so, _it_ is better _that_ they always wash his eyelids (môyak gâs), and to wash them by the clean is good.

28\. The rule is this, that thou shouldst not consider even any one hopeless (anâîmê<i>d</i>) of heaven, <span id="p350"><sup><small>[ p. 350 ]</small></sup></span> and they should not set _their_ minds steadfastly on hell; thereby much sinfulness for which _there_ is a desire would be undesirable, because _there_ is nothing which is a sin _in_ my religion for which _there_ is no retribution, as it says in the Gâthas [^1] thus:—‘Of those who are aware that thou art, O Aûharmazd! is even he who is infamous (raspakŏ); and they know the punishment of him even who is very sinful.’ 29. And _as to_ him even who is a very sinful person, through the desire [^2] of good works which is entertained by him, _there_ then comes more fully to him the joy of a soul newly worthy (nuk shâya<i>d</i>); as in the Spend _Nask_ [^3] _it_ was shown to Zaratû<i>s</i>t about one man, that all _his_ limbs were in torment, and one foot was outside; _and_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûharmazd about the reason _of it; and_ Aûharmazd said that he was a man, Davâns [^4] by name; he was ruler over thirty-three [^5] districts, and he never practised <span id="p351"><sup><small>[ p. 351 ]</small></sup></span> any good work, except one time when fodder _was_ conveyed by him to a sheep with that one foot.

30\. The rule is this, that when a man has performed his _form of_ worship (ya<i>s</i>t), and his wife has not performed _it, it_ is extremely necessary to perform the suitable _form of_ worship, or to order a Gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> [^1], so that they may become such as are dwelling more closely _together_ in the spiritual _existence_ than in the world; and in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht _Nask_ [^2] it says that a woman (nâîrîk) who shall be reverent (tarsak) is to be considered as much as she who is suitable (zîyâk).

31\. The rule is this, that these five ceremonies (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n), when they shall perform _them_, are good works [^3]; when _one_ does not perform _them_, and the time is manifest to him, and when he shall set _them_ aside to perform _them_ out of the proper time, they shall go to the bridge [^4] _as_ sin; the ceremonies which go to the bridge are these, and in the Hûspâram _Nask_ [^5] it says that _they are_ the non-celebration of the rites (lâ ya<i>s</i>tanŏ) of the season-festivals [^6], the <span id="p352"><sup><small>[ p. 352 ]</small></sup></span> Rapîtvîn [^1], the three _nights_ [^2] _after a death_, the _days devoted_ to the guardian spirits [^3], and the sun and moon [^4].

32\. The rule is this, that at every one of these three things, _which_ come through hungry living, that is, sneezing, yawning, and sighing, _one_ is to speak out a Yathâ-ahû-vairyô and one Ashem-vohû [^5]; and also when _one_ hears the sneezing of any one, to speak _in_ like manner is so considered as an action of the good [^6]; _and_ in the Stû<i>d</i>gar _Nask_ [^7] it says thus: ‘“What prepares sneezing? that is, through what process (kâr) does it come?” And Aûharmazd said thus: “Hungry living, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! because the remedy for its existence is the Ahunavar, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _and_ righteousness [^8].”’

## Footnotes

[^4]: (338:4) A Ya<i>s</i>t is a formula of praise in honour of the sun, moon, water, fire, or some other angel, as well as a term for prayers and worship in general.

[^5]: (338:5) See Chap. I, 3.

[^6]: (338:6) See Chap. III, 32, note.

[^1]: (339:1) See Chap. X, 21. The passage mentioned in the text was probably in the section called Nîrangistân.

[^2]: (339:2) K20 omits this repetition.

[^3]: (339:3) That is, may not render the passage of his soul to heaven, over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge (see Bund. XII, 7), impossible, owing to the sin of arrogance in this world.

[^4]: (339:4) See Chap. X, 25; the passage alluded to was probably at the beginning of the Nask, which treated of ‘the reward of the precepts of religion, and the bridge of the destroyers of good preceptors, adapted to their destruction.’

[^5]: (339:5) See Chap. VI, 3.

[^6]: (339:6) K20 has ‘that a fire is to be properly kept.’

[^7]: (339:7) K20 has ‘and a loss of the strength and wealth of men.’

[^1]: (340:1) See Chap. X, 4; the passage mentioned was probably in that part of the Nask which described the protection afforded by the fire to the new-born Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

[^2]: (340:2) Probably a negative is omitted, or akârînî<i>d</i>anŏ should be translated ‘to make no use of.’

[^3]: (340:3) See Chap. X, 40. K20 has ‘garment.’

[^4]: (340:4) Always written Vadîkdâ<i>d</i> in this second part of Sls., except in Chap. XIII, 7; whereas in the first part it is written in its uncorrupted form <i>G</i>avî<i>d</i>\-dêf-dâ<i>d</i> or <i>G</i>avî<i>d</i>\-<i>s</i>êdâ-dâ<i>d</i>, ‘the law opposed to the demons.’ The passage here quoted is Pahl. Vend. V, 171, 172, with one or two verbal variations.

[^5]: (340:5) Standing for anbânak-aê, which is corrupted in the Vendidad MSS. into the unintelligible form andanakŏ-1, so that this old quotation throws a rather unexpected light upon a passage in the Vendidad which translators would be almost certain to misunderstand. The allusion is to the bags used by a menstruous woman, when eating, to prevent contamination of the food. The Persian Rivâyats state that three bags (kîsah) are made of two thicknesses of strong linen, one bag to wear on each hand, and the third, which is larger, to hold the metal food-bowl and water-goblet. After thoroughly washing her hands and face, she puts the two bags on her hands, taking care that they do not touch her food, or clothes, or any other part of her body. She then feeds herself with a metal spoon, which must not touch her nose; and when the meal p. 341 is finished the food-bowl and water-goblet are placed on the large bag, and the two smaller bags inside it, till wanted again.

[^1]: (341:1) See Chap. I, 1, 2.

[^2]: (341:2) This passage does not appear to be now extant in the Vendidad, and it is possible to read Nask Dâ<i>d</i> instead of Vadîkdâ<i>d</i>. The Dâ<i>d</i>î or Dâ<i>d</i>ak Nask was the eleventh nask or ‘book’ of the complete Mazdayasnian literature, according to the Dînkar<i>d</i>, which merely says that its ‘Avesta and Zand are not communicated to us by the high-priest.’ According to the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>, which calls it Khûstô and the Rivâyats, which call it Kha<i>s</i>t, it was the twelfth Nask, and they give its contents in more detail than usual (see Haug's Essays, pp. 130, 131).

[^3]: (341:3) Meaning that the dead require no clothing, as their future bodies will be clothed out of the garments they have given away in charity. The resemblance of this statement to that contained in Bund. XXX, 28, which must have been abridged from the Dâmdâd Nask (see SZS. IX, 1), renders it possible that it may have been taken from that Nask.

[^4]: (341:4) No fresh meat is to be cooked or eaten for the first three days after a death in the house, according to the Sad-dar Bundahi<i>s</i>, LXXVIII (compare Chap. XVII, 1-3).

[^5]: (341:5) See SZS. IX, 1. The passage here quoted may perhaps be found in the complete text of the Bundahi<i>s</i>, as given in TD (Chap. 37; see Introduction, [p. xxxvii](sbe0504_htm.html)).

[^1]: (342:1) A righteous soul is supposed to step out first to the star station, then to the moon station, and then to the sun station, on its way to Garô<i>d</i>mân, the highest heaven; but if its righteousness is imperfect it has to stop at one of these three stations, which are the three lower grades of heaven (see note on pâhlûm ahvân, Chap. VI, 3).

[^2]: (342:2) Or ‘more provided with zôr,’ which may mean ‘holy-water,’ as the two words zôr and zôhar are occasionally confounded.

[^3]: (342:3) Or, perhaps, ‘if they shall not pray over _it_.’

[^4]: (342:4) See Bund. III, 20, XIX, 19, 20.

[^5]: (342:5) Vend. XVII, 29.

[^6]: (342:6) Barman-zerkhûni<i>s</i>nîh may also mean ‘begetting a son.’

[^7]: (342:7) See Chap. X, 21. The word ‘twentieth’ appears to refer to the second group of twenty sections, one of which treated of the begetting, birth, and treatment of children.

[^8]: (342:8) Referring to the egg, drôns, frasasts, and gâu<i>s</i> hudh<i>a</i>u or ‘meat-offering’ (which may be either butter or meat, see Chap. XI, 4) that are used in the drôn ceremony, or consecration of the sacred cakes (see note on drôn, Chap. III, 32). The object of p. 343 this paragraph is, evidently to reprove niggardliness in such offerings, and to prevent their being mere pretexts for feasting.

[^1]: (343:1) See Chap. X, 25., The passage alluded to here was probably in that section, of the last twenty-two, which treated of the spirits of the earthly existences, one portion of which was ‘about preparing offerings (aûstôfrîtô) to the angels.’

[^2]: (343:2) M6 has ‘the fire of Aûharmazd is to be fully maintained, _and_ it is revealed,’ &c. This section is a repetition of Chap. X, 4, with a few variations.

[^3]: (343:3) Here written Dû<i>d</i>kâv.

[^4]: (343:4) Or it may be read <i>s</i>êdâ, ‘a demon’, meaning, an ‘arch-fiend.’

[^1]: (344:1) That is, in the first thirty sections of the Nask (see Chap. X, 25); the passage alluded to must have been, in that portion which treated of new-born infants and their proper treatment.

[^2]: (344:2) §§ 13-16 are a repetition of Chap. X, 20-23, with a few variations.

[^3]: (344:3) The word appears to be tôpŏ or tûfŏ, which would rather mean ‘scum’ or ‘gum’ (see Bund. XXVII, 19), unless it be considered a miswriting of tô<i>g</i>ŏ or tô<i>z</i>ŏ, which would mean ‘thin bark’ or ‘bast.’ It can also be read tûpar, ‘a leather bag,’ and the sentence can be so translated as to imply that a toothpick should be cut out of a leather bag, an alternative similar to that suggested by the text of Chap. X, 20.

[^4]: (344:4) See Chap. I, 3.

[^5]: (344:5) Reading amat, ‘when,’ instead of mûn, ‘who’ (see Bund. I, 7, note).

[^6]: (344:6) See Chap. X, 21.

[^1]: (345:1) The writer of M6 evidently found his original illegible at this place, as he wrote . . . maman instead of mûn denman.

[^2]: (345:2) M6 has ‘performance,’ which is probably a misreading, due to the original of that MS. being partially illegible.

[^3]: (345:3) See Chap. X, 4. This Nask is not mentioned in Chap. X, 22, and the passage here alluded to is not to be traced in any of the short accounts of its contents.

[^4]: (345:4) See Chap. X, 3, 22.

[^5]: (345:5) See SZS. IX, 1, and Chap. X, 22.

[^6]: (345:6) See Chap. X, 3, 23.

[^1]: (346:1) K20 has ‘that water is not to be drawn on foot.’

[^2]: (346:2) Probably the Bakân-yastô is meant, which was the fourteenth nask or ‘book’ of the complete Mazdayasnian literature, according to the Dînkar<i>d</i>; but according to the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i> and the Rivâyats it was the fifteenth nask, called Baghân-ya<i>s</i>t. For its contents, as given by the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>, see Haug's Essays, p. 132. The following is the account of it given in the eighth book of the Dînka<i>r</i>d:—
  ‘The Bakân-yastô is a treatise, first, on the worship (yastô) of Aûharmazd, the most pre-eminent of divinities (bakân a<i>v</i>artûm), and, secondly, the worship of the angels of the other invisible and visible worldly existences, out of whom are even the names of the days, and the glory, power, triumph, and miraculousness of their life also is extreme; the angels who are invoked by name in their worship, and the attention _and_ salutation _due_ to them; the worthiness _and_ dispensation of favour for worshippers, _and_ the business of their many separate recitations unto the angels; the business of unlimited acquaintance with knowledge about the promoters of the treasures of the period, unto whom the creator Aûharmazd _is_ to intrust them, _and_ they remain to cause industry. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.’

[^3]: (346:3) See Bund. I, 21. This section is a repetition of Chap. X, 7, with a few variations.

[^4]: (346:4) See Chap. I, 3.

[^5]: (346:5) That is, the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô (see Bund. I, 21).

[^1]: (347:1) See B. Yt. III, 25. The passage here quoted must have been in the first division of the Nask.

[^2]: (347:2) This section is a repetition of Chap. X, 31.

[^3]: (347:3) See Bund. XX, 2.

[^4]: (347:4) The yô<i>s</i>dâsarân, ‘purifiers’ (Av. yao<i>z</i>dâthrya), are those priests who retain so much of the purifying effect of the Bareshnûm ceremony (see Chap. II, 6) as to be able to assist in purifying others by means of the same ceremony. When that effect has passed away a priest can no longer perform the sacred rites, until he has again undergone the nine nights’ purification of the Bareshnûm.

[^5]: (347:5) Reading band, but it may he bôd, ‘vitality, essence.’

[^6]: (347:6) See Chap. II, 52.

[^1]: (348:1) The passage here quoted is from Pahl. Vend. IX, 4-6.

[^2]: (348:2) Referring to the Bareshnûm-gah, or place prepared for the Bareshnûm ceremony of purification with bull's urine and water, which are handed to the person undergoing purification by an officiating priest (see Chap. II, 6). The place is marked out with furrows in the ground, and furnished with stones (magh) to squat upon during the ablutions (see B. Yt. II. 36). The construction of this paragraph is very obscure in many places, and its proper division into sentences is, therefore, uncertain.

[^1]: (349:1) Reading nihân, but we might perhaps read ‘causes (vahân) of pollution of many kinds.’ The meaning of the section is, that it is necessary for the purifying priest to maintain his own purity by frequently undergoing the Bareshnûm ceremony himself.

[^2]: (349:2) Ya<i>s</i>t-i Navashâ<i>d</i>ar in all MSS., but the latter word is most probably a corruption of Av. navakhshapara, ‘a period of nine nights,’ for which length of time the Bareshnûm ceremony must be continued (see Vend. IX, 144, XIX, 80). The ‘Navashâ<i>d</i>ar rite’ is, therefore, ‘the ceremony of the nine nights,’ which should be frequently undergone by the priests who celebrate the Vendidad ceremonial.

[^3]: (349:3) M6 has pavan pî<i>s</i>ak, ‘with ceremony.’

[^4]: (349:4) M6 has ‘them.’

[^5]: (349:5) M6 has ‘_one_ knows it is unto the cup and bull’s urine;' but as M6 was evidently copied from a MS. already nearly illegible in some places, it is generally safer to follow K20, except when M6 supplies words omitted by the more careless writer of K20.

[^1]: (350:1) The passage here quoted from the Gâthas will be found in Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 7.

[^2]: (350:2) M6 has merely ‘through the good works which are practised by him;’ but K20 has ‘1 hamak’ inserted at this point, which seems to indicate the existence of the nearly identical Pahlavi letters kâmak, ‘desire,’ in the original from which it was copied.

[^3]: (350:3) See Chap. X, 4. The passage here quoted was no doubt contained in that part of the Nask which treated of the exhibition of heaven and hell to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, which must have been very similar to the Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf-nâmak, in which most of the details of this story about Davâns are given (see AV. XXXII).

[^4]: (350:4) This is, no doubt, the Av. davãs of Yas. XXXI, 10, which may be translated ‘hypocrite.’ The Pahlavi translation of the line in which the word occurs is thus rendered in Haug‘s Essays (p. 351): ’Aûharmazd does not allot to him who is an idler, the infidel who is any hypocrite (davãs) in the sacred recitations. In the good religion it is asserted that even as much reward as they give to the hypocrite they, do not give to the infidel.'

[^5]: (350:5) K20 has ‘thirty-four.’

[^1]: (351:1) Here written gêtôk-kharî<i>d</i>, but see Chap. V, 6, and Bund. XXX, 28.

[^2]: (351:2) See B. Yt. III, 25; but the passage here quoted is not clearly indicated in the accounts we have of the contents of this Nask.

[^3]: (351:3) The distinction between these ceremonies and those whose values as good works are given in Chap. XVI, 6, appears to be that any omission in performing these five at their proper times amounts; to an absolute sin, whereas the others are not so indispensable.

[^4]: (351:4) That is, they will be taken into account at the judgment on the soul's actions at the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge (see Bund. XII, 7).

[^5]: (351:5) See Chap. X, 21. The passage here quoted was probably in the section called Nîrangistân.

[^6]: (351:6) The Gâsânbârs or Gâhanbârs (see Bund. XXV, 1-6).

[^1]: (352:1) The midday period (see Bund. II, 8; 9, XXV, 9-14).

[^2]: (352:2) See Chap. VIII, 6.

[^3]: (352:3) See Chap. X, 2.

[^4]: (352:4) See Chap. VII, 1-5.

[^5]: (352:5) See Bund. I, 21, XX, 2.

[^6]: (352:6) That is, it is commendable, though not obligatory. The practice of uttering a blessing on hearing a sneeze is still common in many parts of Europe.

[^7]: (352:7) See B. Yt. I, 1. The passage here quoted is not to be traced in any of the accounts of this Nask.

[^8]: (352:8) ‘The Ahunavar and praise of righteousness’ would be a Pahlavi equivalent for ‘the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô and Ashem-vohû.’
