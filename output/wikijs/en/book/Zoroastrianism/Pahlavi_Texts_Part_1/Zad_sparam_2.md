## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER II.

On the coming in of Aharman to the creatures it is thus declared in revelation, that _in_ the month Fravar<i>d</i>în _and_ the day Aûharmazd, at noon [^1], he came forth to the frontier of the sky. 2. The sky sees _him_ and, on account of _his_ nature, fears as much as a sheep trembles at a wolf; _and_ Aharman came on, scorching _and_ burning into it. 3. Then he came to the water which was arranged below the earth [^2], and darkness without an eyelid was brought on by him; and he came on, through the middle of the earth, as a snake all-leaping comes on out of a hole; and he stayed within the whole earth. 4. The passage where he came on is his own, the way to hell, through which the demons make the wicked run.

5\. Afterwards, he came to a tree, such as was of a single root, the height of which _was_ several feet, and _it was_ without branches and without bark, juicy _and_ sweet; and to keep the strength of. all kinds of trees in its race, it was in the vicinity of the-middle of the earth; and at the self-same time _it became_ quite withered [^3].

6\. Afterwards, he came to the ox, the sole-created [^4], as it stood as high as Gâyômar<i>d</i> on the <span id="p162"><sup><small>[ p. 162 ]</small></sup></span> bank of the water of Dâîtih [^5] _in_ the middle of the earth; and its distance from Gâyômar<i>d</i> being as much as its own height, it was also distant from the bank of the water of Dâîtih by the same measure; and it was a female, white _and_ brilliant as the moon. 7. As the adversary came upon _it_ Aûharmazd gave _it_ a narcotic, which is also called ‘bang,’ to eat, and to rub the ‘bang’ before the eye [^6], so that the annoyance from the assault of crimes may be less; it became lean and ill, _and_ fell upon its right breast [^7] trembling.

8\. Before the advance to Gâyômar<i>d</i>, who was then about one-third the height of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ was brilliant as the sun; Aûharmazd forms, from the sweat [^8] on the man, a figure of fifteen years, radiant _and_ tall, and sends it on to Gâyômar<i>d</i>; and, he also brings his sweat [^9] on to him as long as one Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^10] is _being_ recited. 9. When he issued from the sweat, and raised his eyes, he saw. the world when it was dark as night [^11]; on the whole earth were the snake, the scorpion, the lizard (vazak), and noxious creatures of many kinds; _and_ so the other kinds of quadrupeds stood among the <span id="p163"><sup><small>[ p. 163 ]</small></sup></span> reptiles; every approach of the whole earth was as though not as much as a needle's point remained, in which there was no rush of noxious creatures. 10. _There were_ the coming of a planetary _star_ into planetary conjunction, and the moon and planets at sixes and sevens [^12]; many dark forms with the face and curls of A<i>z</i>\-i Dahâk suffered punishment in company with certain non-Iranians; _and_ he was amazed at calling the wicked out from the righteous.

11\. Lastly, he (Aharman) came up to the fire, and mingled darkness and smoke with it [^13].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (161:1) Bund. III, 12.

[^2]: (161:2) Bund. III, 13.

[^3]: (161:3) Bund. III, 14, 16.

[^4]: (161:4) The primeval ox, or first-created representative of animals, as Gâyômar<i>d</i> was of mankind; from which two representatives all mankind and animals are said to have been afterwards developed. There seems to have been some doubt as to the sex of this mythological ox; here it is distinctly stated to have been a female, but from Bund. X, 1, 2, XIV, 3, it would appear to have been a male, and this seems to be admitted by Dâ<i>d</i>\-sparam himself, in Chap. IX, 7.

[^5]: (162:1) The Dâîtîk river (see Bund. XX, 13).

[^6]: (162:2) This is a misunderstanding of the corresponding phrase in Bund. III, 18. The narcotic here mentioned is usually prepared from the hemp plant, and is well known in India and the neighbouring countries.

[^7]: (162:3) See Bund. IV, 1.

[^8]: (162:4) The word which, as it stands in the MS., looks like hômanâe, is here taken as a transposition of min khvâe, in accordance with Bund. III, 19; but it may be a variant of anumâe, ‘embryo,’ in which case the translation should be, ‘forms an embryo into the shape of a man of fifteen years.’

[^9]: (162:5) Or it may be ‘sleep,’ both here and in § 9.

[^10]: (162:6) See Bund. I, 21.

[^11]: (162:7) Bund. III, 20.

[^12]: (163:1) Literally, ‘in fours and fives.’

[^13]: (163:2) Bund. III, 24.
