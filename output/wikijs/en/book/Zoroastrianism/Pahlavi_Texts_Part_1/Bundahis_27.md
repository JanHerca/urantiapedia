## BUNDAHI<i>S</i>. CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. On the nature of plants it says in revelation, that, before the coming of the destroyer, vegetation had no thorn and bark about it; and, afterwards, when the destroyer came, it became coated with bark _and_ thorny [^1], for antagonism mingled with every single thing; owing to that cause vegetation is also much mixed with poison, like Bi<i>s</i> the height of hemp (kand) [^2], that is poisonous, for men when they eat _it_ die.

2\. In like manner even as the animals, with grain of fifty and five species _and_ twelve species of medicinal plants, have arisen from the primeval ox [^3], ten thousand [^4] species among the species of principal <span id="p100"><sup><small>[ p. 100 ]</small></sup></span> plants, _and_ a hundred thousand species among _ordinary_ plants have grown from all these seeds of the tree opposed to harm [^1], the many-seeded, _which_ has grown in the wide-formed ocean. 3. When the seeds of all these plants, with those from the primeval ox, have arisen upon it, every year the bird [^2] strips that tree _and_ mingles all the seeds in the water; Tî<i>s</i>tar seizes _them_ with the rain-water and rains _them on_ to _all_ regions. 4. Near to that tree the white Hôm, the healing and undefiled, has grown at the source of the water of Arêdvîvsûr [^3]; every one who eats _it_ becomes immortal, and they call it the Gôkar<i>d</i> [^4] tree, as it is said that Hôm is expelling death [^5]; also in the renovation _of the universe_ they prepare its immortality therefrom [^6]; _and_ it is the chief of plants [^7].

5\. These are as many genera of plants as exist: trees and shrubs, fruit-_trees_, corn, flowers, aromatic herbs, salads, spices, grass, wild plants, medicinal <span id="p101"><sup><small>[ p. 101 ]</small></sup></span> _plants_, gum _plants_, and all producing [^1] oil, dyes, _and_ clothing. 6. I _will_ mention them also a second time: all whose fruit is not welcome as food of men, _and_ are perennial (sâlvâr), as the cypress, the plane, the white poplar, the box, and others of this genus, they call trees and shrubs (dâr va dirakht). 7. The produce of everything welcome as food of men, _that_ is perennial, as the date, the myrtle, the lote-plum [^2], the grape, the quince, the apple, the citron, the pomegranate, the peach, the fig, the walnut, the almond, _and_ others in this genus, they call fruit (mîvak). 8. Whatever requires labour with the spade [^3], _and_ is perennial, they call a shrub (dirakht). 9. Whatever requires that they take its crop through labour, _and its_ root withers away, such as wheat, barley, grain, various kinds [^4] of pulse, vetches, _and_ others of this genus, they call corn (<i>g</i>ûr<i>d</i>âk). 10. Every _plant with_ fragrant leaves, _which_ is cultivated by the hand-labour of men, _and_ is perennial (hamvâr), they call an aromatic herb (siparam). 11. Whatever sweet-scented blossom arises _at_ various seasons through the hand-labour of men, or has a perennial root _and_ blossoms in _its_ season _with_ new shoots _and_ sweet-scented blossoms, as the rose, the narcissus, the jasmine, the dog-rose (nêstarûn), <span id="p102"><sup><small>[ p. 102 ]</small></sup></span> the tulip, the colocynth (kavastîk), the pandanus (kêdi), the <i>k</i>amba, the ox-eye (hêri), the crocus, the swallow-wort (zarda), the violet, the kârda, _and_ others of this genus, they call a flower (gûl). 12. Everything whose sweet-scented fruit, or sweet-scented blossom, arises in _its_ season, without the hand-labour of men, they call a wild plant (vahâr or nihâl). 13. Whatever is welcome as food of cattle and beasts _of burden_, they call grass (giyâh). 14. Whatever enters into cakes (pê<i>s</i>\-pârakîhâ) they call spices (âvzârîhâ). 15. Whatever is welcome in eating of bread, as torn shoots [^1] of the coriander, water-cress (kakî<i>g</i>), the leek, _and_ others of this genus, they call salad (têrak) [^2]. 16. Whatever is like spinning [^3] cotton, _and_ others of this genus, they call clothing _plants_ (<i>g</i>âmak). 17. Whatever lentil [^4] is greasy, as sesame, dûshdâng, hemp, zandak [^5], and others of this genus, they call an oil-_seed_ (rôkanô). 18. Whatever _one_ can dye clothing with, as saffron, sapan-wood, za<i>k</i>ava, vaha, _and_ others of this genus, they call a dye-_plant_ (rag). 19. Whatever root, or gum [^6], or wood <span id="p103"><sup><small>[ p. 103 ]</small></sup></span> is scented, as frankincense [^1], varâ<i>s</i>t [^2], kust, sandalwood, cardamom [^3], camphor, orange-scented mint, _and_ others of this genus, they call a scent (bôd). 20. Whatever stickiness comes out from plants [^4] they call gummy (za<i>d</i>ak). 21. The timber which proceeds, from the trees, when it is either dry or wet, they call wood (<i>k</i>îbâ). 22. Every one of all these plants which is so, they call medicinal (dârûk) [^5].

23\. The principal fruits are _of_ thirty kinds (khadûînak), and ten species (sar<i>d</i>ak) of them are fit to eat inside and outside, as the fig, the apple, the quince, the citron, the grape, the mulberry, the pear, _and_ others of this kind; ten are fit to eat outside, _but_ not fit to eat inside, as the date, the peach, the white apricot, _and_ others of this kind; those which are fit to eat inside, _but_ not fit to eat outside, are the walnut, the almond, the pomegranate, the cocoanut [^6], the filbert [^7], the chesnut [^8], the pistachio nut, the vargân, _and_ whatever else of this description are very remarkable.

24 [^9]. This, too, it says, that every single flower is appropriate to an angel (ameshôspend) [^10], as the <span id="p104"><sup><small>[ p. 104 ]</small></sup></span> white [^1] jasmine (saman) is for Vohûman, the myrtle _and_ jasmine (yâsmin) are Aûharmazd‘s own, the mouse-ear (or sweet marjoram) is Ashavahi<i>s</i>t’s [^2] own, the basil-royal is Shatvaîrô‘s own, the musk flower is Spendarma<i>d</i>’s, the lily is Horvada<i>d</i>‘s, the <i>k</i>amba is Amerôda<i>d</i>’s, Dîn-_pavan-Âtarô_ _has_ the orange-scented mint (vâ<i>d</i>rang-bôd), Âtarô _has_ the marigold [^3] (âdargun), the water-lily is Âvân‘s, the white marv is Khtûrshê<i>d</i>’s, the ranges [^4] is Mâh‘s, the violet is Tîr’s, the mêren [^5] is Gô<i>s</i>‘s, the kârda is Dîn-pavan-Mitrô’s, all violets are Mitrô‘s, the red chrysanthemum (khêr) is Srôsh’s, the dog-rose (nestran) is Rashnû‘s, the cockscomb is Fravar<i>d</i>în’s, the sisebar is Vâhrâm‘s, the yellow chrysanthemum is Râm’s, the orange-scented mint is Vâ<i>d</i>‘s [^6], the trigonella is Dîn-pavan-Dîn’s, the hundred-petalled rose is Dîn‘s, all kinds of wild flowers (vahâr) are Ar<i>d</i>’s [^7], Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i> _has_ all the white Hôm [^8], the bread-baker‘s basil is Asmân’s, Zamyâ<i>d</i> _has_ the crocus, Mâraspend _has the flower_ [^9] of Ardashîr, <span id="p105"><sup><small>[ p. 105 ]</small></sup></span> Anîrân _has_ this Hôm of the angel Hôm [^1], of three kinds.

25\. It is concerning plants that every single kind _with_ a drop of water on a twig (teh) they should hold four finger-breadths in front of the fire [^2]; Most of all it is the lotos (kûnâr) they speak of.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (99:1) M6 has ‘poisonous,’ but is evidently copied from an original almost illegible in some places.

[^2]: (99:2) Perhaps ‘hemp the height of Bî<i>s</i>’ would better express the Pahlavi words, but Bî<i>s</i> (Napellus Moysis) is often mentioned as a poisonous plant. The phrase may also be translated ‘like Bî<i>s</i> _and_ tall hemp.’

[^3]: (99:3) See Chap. XIV, 1.

[^4]: (99:4) M6 has ‘a thousand,’ but marks an omission. See Chap. IX. 4.

[^1]: (100:1) See Chaps. IX, 5, XVIII, 9, XXIX, 5.

[^2]: (100:2) The apparently contradictory account in Chap. IX, 2, refers only to the first production of material plants from their spiritual or ideal representative. The bird here mentioned is <i>K</i>amrô<i>s</i> (see Chaps. XIX, 15, XXIV, 29), as appears from the following passage (Mkh. LXII, 40-42): ‘And the bird <i>K</i>amrô<i>s</i> for ever sits _in_ that vicinity; and his work is this, that he collects that seed which sheds from the tree of all seeds, which is opposed to harm, and conveys _it_ there where Tî<i>s</i>tar seizes the water, so that Tî<i>s</i>tar may seize the water with that seed of all kinds, and may rain _it_ on the world with the rain.’

[^3]: (100:3) See Chaps. XII, 5, XIII, 3-5.

[^4]: (100:4) Here written Gôkarn in all MSS. See Chaps. IX, 6, XVIII, I, 2.

[^5]: (100:5) That is, in Yas. IX, where Haoma is entitled dûraosha.

[^6]: (100:6) See Chap. XXIV, 27.

[^7]: (100:7) See Chap. XXIV, 18.

[^1]: (101:1) Comparing this list with the subsequent repetition it appears probable that hamâk barâ is a corruption of aesam bôd (see §§ 19, 21), and that we ought to read ‘gum _plants_, woods, scents, _and plants_ for oil, dyes, _and_ clothing.’ M6 has ‘oil _and_ dyes for clothing.’

[^2]: (101:2) The kûnâr (see Chap. XV, 13).

[^3]: (101:3) The Pâz. pêhani (which is omitted in K20) is evidently a misreading of Pahl. pashang, ‘a hoe-like spade.’

[^4]: (101:4) M6 adds Pâz. gavina (Pahl. gûnak) to gvî<i>d</i> gvî<i>d</i> mungân, without altering the meaning materially.

[^1]: (102:1) Reading stâk darî<i>d</i>; Justi has ‘baked shoots;’ Anquetil has ‘the three following;’ M6 has stâk va karafs, ‘shoots and parsley.’

[^2]: (102:2) Or târak in § 5, Pers. tarah.

[^3]: (102:3) Reading Huz. neskhunân, ‘twisting,’ but the word is doubtful. Justi has ‘sitting _on the plant_,’ which is a rather singular description for cotton.

[^4]: (102:4) Reading ma<i>k</i>ag; Anquetil, Windischmann, and Justi read mazg, ‘marrow,’ but this is usually written otherwise.

[^5]: (102:5) Perhaps for zêtô, ‘olive,’ as Anquetil supposes, and Justi assumes.

[^6]: (102:6) Reading tûf (compare Pers. tuf, ‘saliva’).

[^1]: (103:1) Pâz. kendri for Pahl. kundur probably.

[^2]: (103:2) Justi compares Pers. bargha<i>s</i>t.

[^3]: (103:3) Pâz. kâkura may be equivalent to Pers. qaqulah, ‘cardamoms,’ or to Pers. kâkul or kâkûl, ‘marjoram.’

[^4]: (103:4) K20 omits a line, from here to the word ‘either.’

[^5]: (103:5) The line which contained this sentence is torn off in K20.

[^6]: (103:6) Pâz. anârsar is a misreading of Pahl. anârgîl (Pers. nârgîl, ‘cocoa-nut’).

[^7]: (103:7) Pâz. pendak, a misreading of Pahl. funduk.

[^8]: (103:8) Pâz. shahbrôd, a misreading of Pahl. shahbalût; omitted in M6.

[^9]: (103:9) M6 begins a new chapter here.

[^10]: (103:10) These are the thirty archangels and angels whose names are applied to the thirty days of the Parsi month, in the order in p. 104 which they are mentioned here, except that Aûharmazd is the first day, and Vohûman is the second.

[^1]: (104:1) M6 has ‘yellow.’

[^2]: (104:2) Synonymous with the Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t of Chap. I, 26.

[^3]: (104:3) Anquetil, Windischmann, and Justi have ‘the poppy.’

[^4]: (104:4) M6 has Pâz. lg as only the first part of the word, and Justi translates it by ‘red lac,’ which is not a plant. Transcribing the Pâzand into Pahlavi, perhaps the nearest probable word is rand, ‘laurel.’

[^5]: (104:5) M6 has Pâz. mênr; Anquetil has ‘vine blossom,’ and is followed by Windischmann and Justi, but the word is very uncertain.

[^6]: (104:6) The remainder of this chapter is lost from K20.

[^7]: (104:7) This female angel is also called Arshi<i>s</i>ang (see Chap. XXII, 4).

[^8]: (104:8) See § 4.

[^9]: (104:9) M6 leaves a blank space for the name of the flower; perhaps it is the marv-i Ardashîrân.

[^1]: (105:1) Reading, in Pahlavi, Hôm yêdatô aê hôm.

[^2]: (105:2) See Chap. XXI, 1. Referring to the necessity of drying firewood before putting it on the fire. The kûnâr is specially mentioned, as one of the first fire-woods used by mankind, in Chap. XV, 13.
