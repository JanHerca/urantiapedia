## SHAYÂST LA-SHAYÂST. CHAPTER V.

1\. Of unseasonable chatter [^1] that of children of five years of age has no root; and from five years till seven years, when _one_ is under the tuition of his <span id="p291"><sup><small>[ p. 291 ]</small></sup></span> father _and_ innocent [^2], it has no root _in_ him, and when sinful it has root _in_ the father [^3]. 2. And from eight years till _they are_ man and woman of fifteen years, if even _one_ is innocent during the performance of the ritual (ya<i>s</i>tô), but is able to say its Ithâ and Ashem-vohû [^4], and does not say _them, it_ is the root of unseasonable chatter for him [^5]; and when _he_ is able to perform _his_ ritual by heart (narm), and says _only_ the Ithâ and Ashem-vohû, some _have_ said that such is as when his ritual is not performed _and there_ is no offering (yastôfrî<i>d</i>), and some _have_ said that it is not unseasonable chatter.

3\. Unseasonable chatter _may_ occur at every ceremonial (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ); _for_ him who has performed the ritual it is a Tanâpûhar _sin [^6]; for_ him who has not performed the ritual _it_ is less, some _have_ said three Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâms [^7]. 4. The measure of unseasonable chatter is a Tanâpûhar _sin_; this is where every ceremony, or every morsel, or every _drop of_ urine is not completed [^8]. 5. Of the unseasonable chatter of <span id="p292"><sup><small>[ p. 292 ]</small></sup></span> him who has not performed the ritual Afarg [^9] said this degree is slighter; Mê<i>d</i>ôk-mâh [^9] said both are alike, and he spoke further of this, since for him who has not performed the ritual, and does not attend to [^10] saying its Ithâ and Ashem-vohû, it is more severe than for him who has performed the ritual, and does not attend to consecrating its sacred cake (drôn). 6. Mê<i>d</i>ôk-mâh said that it (the ceremonial) [^11] does not become Gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> [^12]; Afarg said that it amounts to an offering (yastôfrî<i>d</i>) [^13] for every one, except for that person who _knows_ the ritual by heart, and through sinfulness will not perform _it;_ and it becomes _his_ at the time when, during his life _and_ by his command, it is recited with this intention, namely: ‘I wish to do _it_, my faith (astôbânîh) is in the religion [^14].’

7\. The deaf and dumb when it is not possible for him to say an Ashem does not commit unseasonable chatter [^15]; and when it is possible for him to say an Ashem he shall three times say of it, ‘Ashem, ashem, ashem;’ and if it be possible for him to say <span id="p293"><sup><small>[ p. 293 ]</small></sup></span> ‘ithâ’ and ‘ashem-vohû’ it is well, and when it is only possible for him to say ‘ithâ’ it matters not [^16].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (290:2) See Chap. IV, 9.

[^2]: (291:1) That is, intending no harm, as contrasted with sinful or wilful chatter in defiance of instruction.

[^3]: (291:2) Because the father is supposed to be responsible, in the next world, for the sins of the child, even as he will profit by its good works (see, Chaps. X, 22, XII, 15).

[^4]: (291:3) See Chap. III, 35.

[^5]: (291:4) Inattention to prayers evinced by improper silence is thus put upon the same footing as inattention evinced by improper talking. This portion of the sentence is omitted in K20.

[^6]: (291:5) See Chap. I, 1, 2. It is a greater sin in the officiating priests than in the other persons present at the ceremony.

[^7]: (291:6) Probably a Farmân sin (see Chap. IV, 14, note).

[^8]: (291:7) Referring to the three principal occasions when a prayer (vâ<i>g</i>), is taken inwardly and retained until the completion of the action; during which time it is unlawful to say anything but the prescribed prayers (see Chap. III, 6, note).

[^9]: (292:1) See Chap. I, 3.

[^10]: (292:2) Literally, ‘believe or trust to.’

[^11]: (292:3) During which unseasonable chatter occurs.

[^12]: (292:4) Generally written Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i> (see Bund. XXX, 28); but, perhaps, we should here read yastôfrî<i>d</i>, ‘offering,’ though gêtôk-kharî<i>d</i> occurs in Chap. XII, 30.

[^13]: (292:5) The MSS. have merely stôfrî<i>d</i>, which differs from the foregoing gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> only in one Pahlavi letter, so we should probably read the same word in both cases, but which of them it ought to be is uncertain.

[^14]: (292:6) Meaning, apparently, that he can obtain the benefit of any past ceremony, forfeited by wilful negligence, by repentance and a repetition of the ceremony during his lifetime.

[^15]: (292:7) By omitting to say it (see § 2). This clause of the sentence is omitted in K20.

[^16]: (293:1) That is, any one barely able to speak must repeat so much of the indispensable prayers as he is able to pronounce, otherwise he will commit sin.
