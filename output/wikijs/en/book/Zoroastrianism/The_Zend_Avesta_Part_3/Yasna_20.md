1\. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the best; there is weal, there is weal to this man when the Right (helps) the Righteousness best, (when the pious man serves it in truth [^1135]). Ahura Mazda spake forth: Ashem vohû vahi_s_tem asti. To this Asha, the holy ritual sanctity, one attributes the <span id="p267">[<sup><small>p. 267</small></sup>]</span> qualities of ‘good’ and ‘best,’ as one attributes property to an owner; thus this sentence vohû vahi_s_tem asti is substantiated (at once [^1136]).

2\. U_s_tâ asti u_s_tâ ahmâi; by this attribution of blessedness (the praiser) assigns every person (or thing) of a sacred nature to every holy person, and as one usually (?) and regularly (?) [^1137] assigns every person or thing (?) [^1138] that is holy to every holy man.

3\. Yya_t_ ashâi vahi_s_tai [^1139]; by these words the worshipper ascribes the entire Mãthra (to Asha Vahi_s_ta), and ascribes all to the Mãthra, as one ascribes the kingdom to Righteousness, and as one ascribes righteousness to the invoking saint; yea, as one ascribes righteousness to us who are the prophets (who shall help and bless the people). The three maxims of the sentences (are thus fulfilled). And every word (in its detail), and the entire utterance in its proclamation, is the word of Ahura Mazda.

CATECHETICAL ADDITION [^1140].

4\. Mazda has made a proclamation. (Question.) Whom did He announce? (Answer.) That holy one who is both heavenly and earthly. (Question.) Of what character is He who has thus announced Him? (Answer.) He is the best, and the one who is exercising sovereign power. (Question.) Of what character is the man whom He announced? (Answer.) <span id="p268">[<sup><small>p. 268</small></sup>]</span> The holy and the best, the one who rules with no capricious tyranny.

We sacrifice to the (several) part(s) of the Asha Vahi_s_ta (prayer). We sacrifice to the heard-recital of the Asha Vahi_s_ta, to its memorising, its chanting, and its sacrificial use [^1141]!

## Footnotes

[^1144]: 266:5 Elsewhere verbally different; ‘when Asha is for A.V.’

[^1145]: 267:1 It is carried into effect; possibly ‘rendered fit for praising’(?).

[^1146]: 267:2 The Pahlavi indicates nâ stâitya (?).

[^1147]: 267:3 Ashavanem here and in Y. XIX, 19 might be a neuter from a transition, or addition.

[^1148]: 267:4 ‘Ashem.’

[^1149]: 267:5 This Catechetical addition is identical with that in Y. XIX. The wording alone is slightly altered in the translation to relieve the sameness.

[^1150]: 268:1 The YêNhê hâtãm follows.
