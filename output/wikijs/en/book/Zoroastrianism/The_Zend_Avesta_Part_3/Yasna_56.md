## Footnotes

[^1243]: 296:1 One might be inclined to render ‘who are so desired by us for our souls.’ But I think that the words are Pâzand to the preceding.

[^1244]: 296:2 Or, ‘endowed with recompense.’

[^1245]: 297:1 Of the female (feminine) names.

[^1246]: 297:2 Or, ‘give to us.’ The Ahuna and Ashem Vohû follow here.

[^1247]: 297:3 The YêNhê hâtãm, &c. follows.
