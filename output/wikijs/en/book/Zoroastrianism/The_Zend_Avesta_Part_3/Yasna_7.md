27\. (To that one) of beings do we sacrifice whose superior (fidelity) in the sacrifice Ahura Mazda knows through his Righteousness (within him, yea, even to those female saints do we sacrifice) whose (superior sanctity is thus known. We sacrifice to all) both males and females whose (superiority is such). (The Ratu speaks.) As an Ahû (revered and) to be chosen, he who is the Zaotar speaks forth to me.

(The Zaotar.) So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned, speak forth!

## Footnotes

[^946]: 222:1 With Ashi; possibly ‘for a blessing,’ as Ashi often has the sense of ‘reward,’ but scrupulous sanctity and completeness seem to be the sense here. (Expressions here are as usual varied.)
