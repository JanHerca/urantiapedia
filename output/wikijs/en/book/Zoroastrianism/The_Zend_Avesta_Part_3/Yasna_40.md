## YASNA XL. PRAYERS FOR HELPERS.

1\. And now in these Thy dispensations, O Ahura Mazda! do Thou wisely [^1201] act for us, and with abundance <span id="p289"><sup><small>[ p. 289 ]</small></sup></span> with Thy bounty and Thy tenderness [^1202] as touching us; and grant that reward which Thou hast appointed to our souls, O Ahura Mazda! 2. Of this do Thou Thyself bestow upon us for this world and the spiritual; and now as part thereof (do Thou grant) that we may attain to fellowship with Thee, and Thy Righteousness for all duration.

3\. And do Thou grant us, O Ahura! men who are righteous, and both lovers and producers of the Right as well. And give us trained beasts for the pastures, broken in for riding [^1203], and for bearing, (that they may be) in helpful [^1204] companionship with us, and as a source of long enduring vigour, and a means of rejoicing grace to us for this [^1205].

4\. So let there be a kinsman lord for us, with the labourers of the village, and so likewise let there be the clients (or the peers [^1206]). And by the help of those may we arise.

So may we be to You, O Mazda Ahura! holy and true [^1207], and with free giving of our gifts.
