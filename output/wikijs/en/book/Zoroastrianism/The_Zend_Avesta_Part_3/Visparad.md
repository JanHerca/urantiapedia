## VISPARAD XII (SP. XIV) 

[^1450].

1\. For the offered Haomas which have been offered in libation to that lofty Lord Ahura Mazda and to the holy Zarathu_s_tra Spitama (produce) abundance in cattle and in men; and this [^1451] abundance is (as) the good Sraosha, who accompanies (us) with the great <span id="p354">[<sup><small>p. 354</small></sup>]</span> splendour of sanctity, and may he [^1452] be here with energetic effort (to aid us in our worship).

2\. We offer the wise offerings of the Ahuna-vairya intoned with sanctity and yet to be intoned, possessing their many teachings of religious wisdom (as they do), and those of the two mortars which pour the Haomas out, and which are pushed forward with precision [^1453], and are now in the course of being thus advanced once more [^1454]. 3. (And so we teach as well the many teachings of the religious wisdom) contained in the words correctly spoken, in the Zarathu_s_trian utterances [^1455], and in the ceremonies correctly practised, and the Baresmans spread exactly, and the Haomas pressed correctly, and the praise, Yasnas, and the doctrines of the Mazdayasnian Religion with their recitations, and their movements. 4. For thus they may become to us more full of devices and of wisdom, and so we offer these wise ritual deeds in the creation, so we impart them with their many points of meaning while we (ourselves) still ponder them as those which Ahura Mazda, the holy One, delivered, which have (as if) their nourishment from Vohu Manah [^1456] and their growth from the Righteous Order, which are the greatest of all beings, the best, and the most beautiful for thus shall these be to us the more full of wisest meaning, and more full of incitation [^1457], and may we be among those (who are) of Spe_n_ta Mainyu's world in that we are imparting (to the chosen) these <span id="p355">[<sup><small>p. 355</small></sup>]</span> precepts of the wisest meaning and these incitations which are contained therein. 5. And full of wisest meaning be ye two to us, O (thou) stone mortar, and (thou) the iron one, as ye are now turned, and as ye are now being advanced [^1458], ye two mortars of the house, \[and of the village, of the tribe, and of the province, and ye who are in this house (itself), this village, tribe, and province\]; yea, in those which are ours, Mazdayasnians, who are steadfast in our worship, who appear with our wood-billets and our perfumes, and with our supplicated blessings \[(Pâzand) for so may they be to us, the more full of wisest teaching\].

<a id="v13"></a>

## VISPARAD XIII (SP. XV) 

[^1459].

1\. According to the ritual we worship Ahura Mazda; according to the ritual we worship the Bountiful Immortals; and we sacrifice to the sacrificial word correctly spoken, and to every Mãthra (as to a sacred word of reason). And we sacrifice to Zarathu_s_tra, him who is especially the possessor of the Mãthra [^1460]; and we sacrifice to the ‘blessings for the saints’ [^1461]; and we worship the ‘hail’ [^1462] addressed to the Bountiful Immortals.

2\. Also we worship the three principal (chapters) uttered (in the Yasna) without addition or omission [^1463]; <span id="p356">[<sup><small>p. 356</small></sup>]</span> and we worship the three principal ones without addition or omission; we worship the three commencing ones entire without addition or omission [^1464]. And we worship the entirety [^1465] of the three principal ones without addition or omission; and their Hâs, their metrical lines, their words, and their word-structure \[and their recital, memorising, chanting, and their steadfast offering\].


<a id="v14"></a>

## VISPARAD XIV (SP. XVI) 

[^1466].

1\. (We worship Ahura Mazda, the holy Lord of the ritual order [^1467]; and we sacrifice to the Gâtha Ahunavaiti) with its measures, and word-structure, and its Zand, with its questions and counter-questions, with its words and its metric feet. And we sacrifice to these as well-recited, and now in the course of being recited; as well-worshipped, and now in the course of being used in worship [^1468]. 2. (Yea, we sacrifice to it) in <span id="p357">[<sup><small>p. 357</small></sup>]</span> its own ‘wisdom’ [^1469], in its own ‘clearness’ [^1470], in its own ‘loving intention’ [^1470], in its sovereignty, and its own ritual order, and its ‘acquired boon’ [^1470], which is also that given by Ahura Mazda for the promotion of piety, for that thought which originates from the ‘heart-devoted self’ [^1470].

3\. (Sp. Chapter XVII.) Also we worship the Ahuna-vairya, the holy lord of the ritual order, the holy lord with its Ahû and its Ratu \[^1471]\]. 4. And we sacrifice to the constituent parts of the Gâtha Ahunavaiti, to its chapters, and its metrical lines, its words, and word-structure, \[and to its heard-recital, and memorised recital, its continuous and its steadfast offering\].

<a id="v15"></a>

## VISPARAD XV (SP. XVIII) 

[^1472].

1\. Hold your feet in readiness, and your two hands, and your understandings [^1473], O ye Zarathu_s_trian Mazdayasnians! for the well-doing of lawful deeds in accordance with the sacred Order, and for the avoidance of the unlawful and evil deeds which are contrary to the ritual. Let the good deeds for the furtherance of husbandry be done [^1474] here. Render ye the needy rich [^1475]. 2. Let Sraosha (Obedience) be present here for the worship of Ahura Mazda, <span id="p358">[<sup><small>p. 358</small></sup>]</span> the most helpful, and the holy, who is so desired by us in the pronunciation, and for the service, and the pondering [^1476] of the Yasna Haptanghâiti, for the heart's devotion to it, for its memorisation, and its victorious and holy recital (or for the victorious saint), without addition or omission, (3) which has been intoned, and which shall yet be uttered as great, powerful, smiting with victory, separate from harmful malice, for the pronunciation of victorious words for Ahura Mazda's Fire. (4, 5 are identical with Visp. I X, 6, 7.)

<a id="v16"></a>


## VISPARAD XVI (SP. XIX) 

[^1477].

1\. And we worship the Fire here, Ahura Mazda's son, and the Yazads having the seed of fire in them, and the Rashnus having the seed of fire [^1478] in them; and we worship the Fravashis of the saints. And we worship Sraosha who smites with victory, and the holy man, and the entire creation of the holy (and the clean). 2. And we worship the Blessedness and the Fravashi of Zarathu_s_tra Spitâma, the saint. And we worship the saints and their blessed Fravashis (as of one). And we worship all their Fravashis (as considered each apart), and those of the saints within the Province, and those of the saints without the Province; yea, we worship the Fravashis of holy men and holy women (wherever they may be, those devoted to the Order of the Faith). And we sacrifice to those whose (service) <span id="p359">[<sup><small>p. 359</small></sup>]</span> for us in the Yasna Ahura Mazda, the holy, has known as the better [^1479], and of these Zarathu_s_tra is the living chief [^1480] and master. And we sacrifice to the fields and the waters, the lands and the plants, and to the constituent parts of the Yasna Haptanghâiti, its chapters, its metred lines, its words, and word-structure.

<a id="v17"></a>

## VISPARAD XVII (SP. XX) 

[^1481].

And we strive after the good thoughts, words, and deeds inculcated in the Yasna Haptanghâiti. A blessing is the Right (called) the Best, (there is) weal; (there is) weal for this (man) when toward Righteousness Best (there is) right.

<a id="v18"></a>

## VISPARAD XVIII (SP. XXI) 

[^1482].

1\. We worship Ahura Mazda with the u_s_ta [^1483]. And we worship the Amesha Spe_n_ta with the u_s_ta, and the holy man, the saint. And we worship the prior world of the holy (and of the clean) with an u_s_ta, and the state of weal and salvation for the holy man (the saint). 2. And we worship that life-long state of blessedness (for the holy) which is the evil man's calamity [^1484]; yea, we worship his eternal [^1485] salvation, and with the salvation prayer. And we sacrifice to every saint who <span id="p360">[<sup><small>p. 360</small></sup>]</span> exists, who is now coming into existence, and who shall exist in future.

<a id="v19"></a>

## VISPARAD XIX (SP. XXII) 

[^1486].

1\. We worship Ahura Mazda the bountiful; and we worship the Bountiful Immortals (saying the Spe_n_ta). And we sacrifice to the bountiful saint, and to the bountiful anticipative understanding [^1487]. Also we sacrifice to the good and bountiful Âramaiti (the ready mind). And we worship her together with [^1488] the bountiful creatures in the creation of the pure. And we sacrifice to the holy creatures who have intelligence as their first [^1489], (to those foremost in their mind). And we worship the omniscient understanding, and Him who is Ahura Mazda (Himself). 2. And we sacrifice to the shining sun, which is the highest of the high; yea, we worship the sun together with the Bountiful Immortals, and the Mãthras with their good ceremonies [^1490]. Also we sacrifice to the glorious achievements, and to this glory (which we have gained). And we sacrifice to the herds which have the Fire and its blessings [^1491]. Also we worship the holy benefit which is so widely <span id="p361">[<sup><small>p. 361</small></sup>]</span> diffused [^1492], and that wisdom which is the bounteous Âramaiti, whose are the laws [^1493] of the Righteous Order, and of those holy creatures who have Righteousness as their first.

<a id="v20"></a>

## VISPARAD XX (SP. XXIII) 

[^1494].

1\. (Homage to the Gâtha Vohu-khshathra [^1495]! We sacrifice to the Vohu-khshathra), (the good kingdom) even the Khshathra-vairya, the kingdom to be desired; and we sacrifice to the iron-founding [^1496], and to the (sacrificial) words [^1497] correctly spoken which smite (the foe) with victory, and which hold the Daêvas subject.

And we worship that reward and that health, that healing and that progress, that growth and that victorious smiting [^1498] (2) which are between the Vohu-khshathra and the Vahi_s_tôi_s_ti [^1499], (and which are acquired by us) by the memorised recital of the good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, for the withstanding of evil thoughts, and words, and deeds; yea, for the undoing of all treacherous thoughts (directed) against me, and of all false words, and unfair deeds. 3. \[^1500], (and which as it recurs becomes) the holy ritual chief.\]

<a id="v21"></a>

<span id="p362">[<sup><small>p. 362</small></sup>]</span>

## VISPARAD XXI (SP. XXIV).

1\. We strive earnestly, and we take up our Yasna and our homage to the good waters, and to the fertile fruit-trees (which bear as of themselves), and to the Fravashis of the saints; yea, we take up our Yasna, and our homage earnestly to those beings which are (so) good, the waters, and the trees, and the Fravashis of the saints, (2) and to the Kine, and to Gaya (Maretan), and to the Mãthra Spe_n_ta (the bounteous word-of-reason), the holy, which works (within and for us with effect), to these we take up our Yasnas and our homage with earnest zeal, and to Thee, O Ahura Mazda! and to thee, O Zarathu_s_tra, we do the same; and to thee, O lofty lord (the Apãm-napâ_t_), and to the Bountiful Immortals. 3. And we sacrifice to the listening (that hears our prayers) and to that mercy, and to the hearing of (our spoken) homage, and to that mercy which is (shown in response to our offered) praise. And we sacrifice to the frârâiti vîdushê, which is contained in the piece _h__v_âdaênâi_s_ ashaonis; and we sacrifice to ‘the good praise which is without hypocrisy, and which has no malice (as its end)’; and we sacrifice to the later Yasna and to its offering; and we sacrifice to the chapters of the later Yasna, and to its metrical lines, its words, and word-structure.

<a id="v22"></a>

## VISPARAD XXII (SP. XXV).

With this chant (fully) chanted, and which is for the Bountiful Immortals and the holy Saoshya_n_ts (who are the prophets who shall serve us), and by means of these (ceremonial) actions, which are (of all) <span id="p363">[<sup><small>p. 363</small></sup>]</span> the best, we desire to utter our supplications for the Kine. It is that chant which the saint has recognised as good and fruitful of blessed gifts, and which the sinner does not know [^1501]. May we never reach that (ill-luck that the sinner) may outstrip us (in our chanting), not in the matter of a plan (thought out), or of words (delivered), or ceremonies (done [^1502]), nor yet in any offering whatever when he (?) approaches (us for harm).

<a id="v23"></a>

## VISPARAD XXIII (SP. XXVI) 

[^1503].

1\. We worship Ahura Mazda as the best [^1504] (worship to be offered in our gifts). We worship the Amesha Spe_n_ta (once more, and as) the best. We worship Asha Vahi_s_ta (who is Righteousness the Best). And we sacrifice to those (prayers) which are evident as the best; that is, the Praises of the Yasnas.

Also we sacrifice to that best wish, which is that of Asha Vahi_s_ta, and we worship Heaven, which is the best world of the saints, bright and all-glorious; and we sacrifice likewise to that best approach which leads to [^1505] it. 2. And we sacrifice to that reward, <span id="p364">[<sup><small>p. 364</small></sup>]</span> health, healing, furtherance, and increase, and to that victory which is within [^1506] the two, the Ahuna-vairya and the Airy_e_mâ-ishyô, through the memorised recital of the good thoughts, words, and deeds. (which they enjoin).

## Footnotes

[^1394]: 335:1 This Visparad consists of additions to various portions of the Yasna; and its several chapters generally follow the corresponding portions of the Yasna in the Vendîdâd Sâdah. The word Visparad means ‘all the chiefs,’ referring to the ‘lords of the ritual.’ Chapter I should be read immediately after Yasna I, 9.

[^1395]: 335:2 Or, ‘I invite.’

[^1397]: 335:3 Lords because ruling as chief objects of attention during their mention in the course of the sacrifice, also, as in this case, genii guarding over all of their class.

[^1398]: 335:4 So De Harlez, admirably following the Pahl. sardîk (sic).

[^1399]: 335:5 Pavan yazi_s_n kar_d_arîh.

[^1400]: 336:1 _A_unghairyô, a collective, or zîzanen, a participle.

[^1401]: 336:2 Here is praise to a part of the Yasna itself, although not yet recited in the V.S.

[^1402]: 336:3 Its chief word is yazamaidê, it is ‘the well-sacrificed,’ the word often occurring.

[^1403]: 336:4 Or, ‘to him who is devoted to the Ahuna, with its Ahû and Ratu (?).’

[^1404]: 336:5 Observe the priority of the Haptanghâiti; it should be read first.

[^1405]: 336:6 Interpolated.

[^1406]: 337:1 This sense is most obvious.

[^1407]: 337:2 The ‘fiend-smiting’ is the common meaning of v_ri_trahâ´; but verethra is clearly ‘victory’ in Zend; v_ri_trâ´ also equals defensive valour.

[^1408]: 337:3 Can dahmahê_k_a mean ‘the departed saint’ here?

[^1409]: 337:4 A lost part of the Avesta, two fragments of which only survive.

[^1410]: 338:1 Comp. Y. XXIX, 2. Y. I, 10-23 follows.

[^1411]: 338:2 Visparad II should be read after Yasna II, 8, of which it is an extension.

[^1412]: 339:1 It is certainly not impossible that the idea of ‘invoking the approach of Ahura’ was meant, but ‘approaching him’ is more natural.

[^1413]: 339:2 Ahûm_k_a ratûm_k_a, applied to the same person, the usage arising from an erroneous rendering of the Ahuna-vairya; see Y. XIX, 12.

[^1414]: 339:3 Yô, with K7b, K11, daretem, passive form; or, ‘who (has) the Mãthra held.’ The text must, however, be in disorder.

[^1415]: 339:4 In the Ashem Vohû.

[^1416]: 340:1 So the Pahlavi.

[^1417]: 340:2 Erroneous Pâzand.

[^1418]: 340:3 This sentence affords support to my rendering of âyêsê, as expressing a desire to approach, rather than one for the approach of (the Genius of) the Mountain; at the same time the latter idea may very possibly be the correct one. (Expressions are curtailed.)

[^1419]: 341:1 Y. II, 10 follows Visparad II, 11.

[^1420]: 341:2 This chapter 1-5 follows Y. XI, 1-8 in the Vendîdâd Sâdah; so, appropriately.

[^1421]: 341:3 The Ratu answers for all according to the rubric printed by Westergaard, but of later origin than the text. It arose from the fact that the several offices were later united in that of the Ratu. Originally the corresponding official answered to his title. The Hâvanan was the Mobad who pounded the Haoma in the mortar.

[^1422]: 341:4 The Mobad who fed the Fire.

[^1423]: 341:5 The Mobad who aided the presentations.

[^1424]: 341:6 The water carrier.

[^1425]: 342:1 The washer.

[^1426]: 342:2 The mixer (?), or the Mobad who attended to disinfections.

[^1427]: 342:3 The Mobad who attended to penance.

[^1428]: 342:4 The typical layman.

[^1429]: 342:5 This important custom was fully treated in the lost Nask, No. 16 (or No. 18, by another reckoning).

[^1430]: 342:6 So the most, but ratukhshathra means elsewhere ‘ruling in the ritual as supreme.’

[^1431]: 343:1 This section follows Y. XI, 9-15 in the V.S., preceding a section described as Y. XI, 59, 60, in the B.V.S.

[^1433]: 343:2 Probably in an imperative sense, or, with some, an infinitive.

[^1434]: 343:3 Read Zaotasti which contains sandhi. It seems a gloss to explain the Âthraom (sic). It is zaotâ asti.

[^1435]: 343:4 This section, preceding Y. XI, closed in the B.V.S., seems to me p. 344 to belong properly after Yasna VIII, and the Myazda offering with the Ratufrîti.

[^1436]: 344:1 Pâzand.

[^1437]: 344:2 This piece should be read after Yasna XIV, with which it is nearly identical. The language of the translation is slightly varied to relieve the effect of sameness.

[^1438]: 345:1 Nearly identical with Yasna XV.

[^1439]: 345:2 This chapter should be read after Yasna XVII, which it appropriately follows in the Vendîdâd Sâdah.

[^1440]: 345:3 Possibly ‘the best (better) course of that best world.’

[^1441]: 346:1 One might consider, ‘virile power which has men and heroes in the mind beforehand;’ but vareti = gûrdîh.

[^1442]: 346:2 Âsyay_a_u (sic) and takhmôtã_s_yay_a_u (sic) agree with feminines; possibly because of the male qualities referred to. They might be said to be in apposition lather than in agreement with the feminine.

[^1443]: 346:3 Sleep is elsewhere an evil; a Demon, Bûshyãsta, rules it; but this is untimely sleep; see, on the other hand, Y. XLIV, 5.

[^1444]: 347:1 ‘Mediated’ (?), or ‘known,’ madhayangha (-uha).

[^1445]: 347:2 See Y. XXXV, 5.

[^1446]: 347:3 This section should be read before Y. XXII.

[^1447]: 347:4 Supplied necessarily from Visp. X, 2; see its genitive.

[^1449]: 347:5 Or, ‘sciences’ (in some cases medical).

[^1450]: 348:1 Having a Ya_s_t.

[^1451]: 348:2 Here is an instance where _h__v_âthra may mean ‘comfort.’

[^1452]: 349:1 Perhaps ‘the Ya_s_ts in the Yasna,’ otherwise the latter portion of the Yasna.

[^1453]: 349:2 This section follows Y. XXII.

[^1454]: 349:3 The varesa consists (as used at present) of three, five, or seven hairs from the tail of a white bull, which are tied to a gold, silver, copper, or brass ring. This can be used as long as the bull lives, but as often as it is used it must be reconsecrated. (Haug.)

[^1455]: 349:4 The wording is purposely varied în the renderings to avoid sameness.

[^1456]: 350:1 To the soul of the person who may be reciting.

[^1457]: 350:2 Zâiri with K4.

[^1458]: 351:1 Here, erroneously, a proper name as in Ya_s_t XIII. Possibly of that Zarathu_s_trian world (period) which loved righteousness; the word occurs after the name of Z. I think that ‘y’ should be ‘v.’

[^1459]: 352:1 Vohu Manah certainly appears the most prominent here. They arose from the ‘good thought’ of Ahura.

[^1460]: 352:2 This office was celebrated in private houses by itinerant priests.

[^1461]: 352:3 YêNhê aêm might be a citation from some lost prayer. The singular aêm may, however, be taken collectively, as families are spoken of.

[^1462]: 353:1 Âvista probably = Avesta; compare Veda. The moral and ceremonial laws.

[^1463]: 353:2 Avestic.

[^1464]: 353:3 Follows Y. XXVII.

[^1465]: 353:4 Hâ seems to have a certain conjunctive force like sa in composition, ‘And thereto the good Sraosha;’ or is it an interjection?

[^1466]: 354:1 Recall h_e__k_â of Y. XLVI, I.

[^1467]: 354:2 With punctilious sanctity.

[^1468]: 354:3 The Parsi priests at present make appropriate manipulations here.

[^1469]: 354:4 In the now ancient Gâthas, &c.

[^1470]: 354:5 Compare gaêth_a_u vîsp_a_u y_a_u vohû thrao_s_tâ mananghâ.

[^1471]: 354:6 Or, ‘may we be more zealous than any who are in the creation of the bounteous spirit.’

[^1472]: 355:1 Referring to manipulations.

[^1473]: 355:2 This fragment follows Y. XXX in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, and was written in allusion to Y. XXVIII, Y. XXIX, and Y. XXX.

[^1474]: 355:3 Referring to mãthra srevaêmâ in Yasna XXVIII, 8.

[^1475]: 355:4 Referring to the words sava_k_â ashavabyô in Yasna XXX, 11.

[^1476]: 355:5 Referring to the word u_s_tâ in Yasna XXX, 11.

[^1477]: 355:6 The three first chapters XXVIII-XXX; the text has bad grammar, or broken connection.

[^1478]: 356:1 It is difficult to see how anapishûtâ can mean ‘without retrenchment,’ but the context seems to require it, and the Pahlavi translation bears evidence to it. Perhaps read anapashûtâ.

[^1479]: 356:2 ‘The whole three first.’ Some suppose the three prayers to be intended (the Ahuna-vairya, the Ashem Vohû, and the YêNhê hâtãm). I think that the three chapters XXVIII-XXX are meant. As the piece follows those three chapters in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, so its expressions indicate a reference to them. This might tend to show that the Ahunavaiti was at one time, if not originally, divided at this place.

[^1480]: 356:3 This fragment was written in evident allusion to the entire Ahunavaiti, which it follows in the Vendîdâd Sâdah. It expresses the veneration acquired by the first Gâtha long after its composition.

[^1481]: 356:4 From the Vendîdâd Sâdah.

[^1482]: 356:5 Frâyaze_n_tãm may be a metaplasm; otherwise ‘of the sacrificers.’

[^1483]: 357:1 Dãmi with K4. Possibly in their own house (dãmi = dani).

[^1487]: 357:2 These words probably allude severally, say, to dãm in Y. XXXI, 7, _k_ithrâ in Y. XXXI, 22, zaoshê in Y. XXXIII, 2, 10, âyaptâ in Y. XXVIII, 8, to zarzd_a_u in Y. XXXI, 1.

[^1488]: 357:3 Erroneous.

[^1489]: 357:4 This piece is a later composed prelude to the Haptanghâiti, which it precedes in the Vendîdâd Sâdah.

[^1490]: 357:5 Sursum corda!

[^1491]: 357:6 Comp. gavôi verezyâtãm, Y. XLVIII, 5.

[^1492]: 357:7 ‘Place the needy with those without need.’

[^1493]: 358:1 Possibly mãzdâtaê_k_a.

[^1494]: 358:2 This piece follows the Haptanghâiti in the Vendîdâd Sâdah; it was intended as a sequel to it.

[^1495]: 358:3 Having the power to propagate its worship, maintaining it unextinguished. De Harlez makes the admirable suggestion, ‘bright as flame’; but the Pahlavi renders tokhmak.

[^1496]: 359:1 Comp. Y. LI, 22.

[^1497]: 359:2 Anghu_s__k_a ratu_s__k_a here referred to the same person; comp. ahû.

[^1498]: 359:3 An addition to chapter XVI.

[^1499]: 359:4 This piece having reference to various expressions in the Gâtha U_s_tavaiti, follows it in the Vendîdâd Sâdah.

[^1500]: 359:5 Referring to u_s_ta in Y. XLIII, 1.

[^1501]: 359:6 See Y. XLV, 7.

[^1502]: 359:7 Akaranem = the eternal thing; otherwise an adjective of two terminations; or, finally, read -ãm.

[^1503]: 360:1 The word spe_n_ta throughout alludes to the Gâtha Spe_n_tâ-mainyu, but it is of course not without grammatical application.

[^1504]: 360:2 In the Bundahi_s_ especially referred to Ahura.

[^1505]: 360:3 Or, ‘together with the bountiful creatures we worship the holy creatures.’

[^1506]: 360:4 This expression may have been accidentally determined by the position of the word manô in the Ahuna-vairya formula; see Y: XIX, 12.

[^1507]: 360:5 Or, ‘the well-fulfilled.’

[^1508]: 360:6 ‘Fire-made’ is unintelligible; ‘fire gifts-having’ may refer to the flocks and herds, as expressing the source of that prosperity which is represented by the holy Fire.

[^1509]: 361:1 Pahl. fravaft sû_d_.

[^1510]: 361:2 Dâthra with K4.

[^1511]: 361:3 This piece from the later Avesta follows Y. LI, in the Vendîdâd Sâdah.

[^1512]: 361:4 From the Vendîdâd Sâdah.

[^1513]: 361:5 Associated with this Gâtha from Y. LI, 9.

[^1514]: 361:6 Compare Y. LI, 3.

[^1515]: 361:7 Y. LI, 9; also perhaps Y. LIII, 8, 9.

[^1516]: 361:8 Between; that is, described in the space between the Vohu-khshathra and the Vahi_s_tôi_s_ti, i.e. in Y. LII. See hamist_e_ê in Y. LII, 4, and paiti_s_tât_e_ê in Visp. XX, 2.

[^1517]: 361:9 This would seem misplaced; perhaps Y. XLII is meant, which follows the Haptanghâiti.

[^1518]: 363:1 The parties are divided by knowledge and ignorance (compare the Gnosis). See Y. XXXI, 12

[^1519]: 363:2 Not in thought, word, or deed may we reach (his) priority in progress

[^1520]: 363:3 This piece from the later Avesta follows Y. LIII, in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, and has reference to its expressions.

[^1521]: 363:4 It is an important suggestion which holds vahi_s_tem as equal to ‘saying vahi_s_tem,’ in allusion to the Vahi_s_ta î_s_ti_s_; but as the word is inflected further on (see vahi_s_tahê), and as it moreover once applies to Asha, as Asha Vahi_s_ta, it is better to render it as having adjective application throughout, being none the less, of course, an intentional echo of the first word of Y. LIII, 1.

[^1522]: 363:5 Or, ‘of it.’

[^1523]: 364:1 Possibly ‘between them,’ meaning the Gâthas which are so placed.
