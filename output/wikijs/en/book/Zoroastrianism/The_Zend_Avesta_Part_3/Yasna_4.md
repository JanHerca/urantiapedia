## Footnotes

[^941]: 213:2 The fact that somewhat of a more technical sumatí, sûktá, suk<i>ri</i>tá adheres to these expressions in this place must not for a moment induce us to suppose that their deeper meaning was lost. All good thoughts, words, and deeds culminated in the ritual, as in an enlightened high ecclesiasticism. They were nourished by it, and not lest in it. (Expressions are here varied.)

[^943]: 213:3 The prominence and supremacy of each deity, or genius, while he is especially the object of worship in the ritual order, the expressions being taken from the Ahuna-vairya.

[^944]: 214:1 Vohu Manah, Asha, and Khshathra.

[^945]: 214:2 Âramaiti, Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, and Ameretatâ<i>t</i>.

[^946]: 214:3 It would seem that the Yasna must have been at the time celebrated in the houses of the worshippers. Hence perhaps some of the priests were pairi<i>g</i>athans.

[^947]: 215:1 Dahyuma.

[^948]: 215:2 Aibigaya.

[^949]: 217:1 Unseized (?).

[^950]: 218:1 Elsewhere with slight verbal change.
