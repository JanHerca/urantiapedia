## THE GÂHS.

THE Gâhs are the five divisions of the day. The Hâvani from 6 to 10 A.M., the Rapithwina from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M., the Uzayêirina from 3 to 6 P.M., the Aiwisrûthrima from 6 to 12 P.M., the Ushahina from 12 P.M. to 6 A.M. The Gâhs here following are prayers which must be recited at the Gâhs of the day; hence their name [^1534].

<a id="1"></a>

## I. THE GÂH HÂVAN 

[^1535].

Unto Ahura Mazda be propitiation. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best—.

1\. I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper, of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra's order, a foe to the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for the holy Hâvani, regulator of the ritual order, for its sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise, and for Sâvanghi and Vîsya, the righteous regulator(s) of the ritual order, for their homage, sacrifice, propitiation, and praise, and for those of the Asnya, the day-lords during daylight, and the Ayara, lords of the days in their length, and for the Mâhya, the month-lords, and the Yâirya, year-lords, and for those of the especial seasons.

2\. And to Mithra of the wide pastures, of the thousand ears, of the myriad eyes, the Yazad of the spoken name [^1536], be sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise, and to Râman <i>H</i><i>v</i>âstra.

3, 4. And we sacrifice to Ahura Mazda the holy <span id="p380">[<sup><small>p. 380</small></sup>]</span> lord of the ritual Order, and to Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, and to the Fravashi of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, the saint. And we sacrifice to the Bounteous Immortals, (the guardians) of the saints, and to the good, heroic, and bounteous Fravashis of the saints (of the living and of the dead), of the bodily, and of those in heaven. And we sacrifice to the highest of the lords, the one that most attains its ends; and we sacrifice to the most strenuous of the Yazads, the most satisfying of the lords of the ritual order, the one who reaches (what he seeks), the most infallibly of those who have as yet approached the nearest in the ritual, even to the timely prayer of the saint who rules in the ritual order. 5. And we sacrifice to the Hâvani, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the Universal Weal, the holy, ruling in the ritual order, and to Deathlessness, the holy, ruling in the ritual order. And we sacrifice to the question and lore of the holy lord of the ritual. And we sacrifice to that heroic mighty Yasna, the Haptanghâiti, the lord of the ritual order. 6. And we sacrifice to Sâvanghi and Vîsya, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order; and we sacrifice to the Airy<i>e</i>mâ-ishyô [^1537], the holy lord of the ritual order, the powerful, victoriously smiting, that which no hate can reach, which overwhelms all torments, and which passes over all torments with victory, which is the uppermost, and the middle, and the foremost, for the effective invocation of that surpassing Mãthra, the five Gâthas.

7, 8. And we sacrifice to Mithra of the wide pastures—, and to Râman <i>H</i><i>v</i>âstra, for the worship and exaltation of Vîsya, the chief. And we sacrifice to <span id="p381">[<sup><small>p. 381</small></sup>]</span> Vîsya, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to Mithra, and to Râman <i>H</i><i>v</i>âstra—.

9-11. And we sacrifice to thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son, the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice to this Baresman which has the Zaothra with it, and the girdle with it, and which is spread with exact sanctity, itself the holy lord. And we sacrifice to the Apãm-napâ<i>t</i>, and to Nairya-sangha, and to that Yazad, the swift curse of the wise. And we sacrifice to the souls of the dead, \[which are the Fravashis of the saints\]. And we worship that exalted Lord who is Ahura Mazda, the highest object of the ritual order, who is the one who has attained the most to homage in the ritual. And we sacrifice to all the words which Zarathu<i>s</i>tra spake, and to all the deeds well done, and to those which shall yet be done in days to come. (And) we sacrifice to that male one of beings whose (gift) in the offering Ahura doth know to be better, and of female saints, the same. As the Ahû is to be (revered and) chosen, so (is) the Ratu, one who rules from the Righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness, and of life's actions done for Mazda, and the Kingdom (is) to Ahura, which to the poor shall offer a nurturer—.

## II. GÂH RAPITHVIN 

[^1538].

1\. Propitiation to Ahura Mazda. A blessing is Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta. I confess as a Mazda-worshipper, and of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra's order—for Rapithwina, the holy lord of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and for praise, and for Frâda<i>t</i>\-fshu and Za<i>n</i>tuma, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, <span id="p382">[<sup><small>p. 382</small></sup>]</span> propitiation, and for praise. 2. And propitiation be to Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta, and to Ahura Mazda's Fire, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise [^1539]. 3, 4. (See Y. LX XI, 2, 3.)

5\. And we sacrifice to the Rapithwina, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the Gâtha Ahunavaiti, the holy, and ruling in the ritual order; and to the Gâtha U<i>s</i>tavaiti, and to the Gâtha Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyu, and to the Gâtha Vohu-khshathra, and to the Gâtha Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti, holy, and ruling in the ritual order. 6. And we sacrifice to Frâda<i>t</i>\-fshu, and to Za<i>n</i>tuma, and to the Fshûshô-mãthra, even to the word correctly spoken, and we sacrifice to the (many) words correctly spoken, even to the victorious ones which slay the Demon-gods (the Daêvas [^1540]). And we sacrifice to the waters and the lands, and to the plants, and to the heavenly Yazads who are givers of the holy and the good. And we sacrifice to the Bountiful Immortals, (the guardians) of the saints.

7\. And we sacrifice to the good, heroic, bountiful Fravashis of the saints, and to the heights of Asha (called) Vahi<i>s</i>ta, and to the greatest Mãthras as moving us to action, the greatest as teaching faithfulness to holy vows, the greatest as referring to actions which are evidently just, and the greatest for the acquisition of the Mazdayasnian Faith. 8. And we sacrifice to that assembly and reunion which the Bountiful Immortals hold when they gather (?) on the heights of Heaven, for the sacrifice and homage of Za<i>n</i>tuma, the lord.

And we (therefore) sacrifice to Za<i>n</i>tuma (as) the holy lord of the ritual order. 9. And we sacrifice <span id="p383">[<sup><small>p. 383</small></sup>]</span> to Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta (who is Righteousness the Best), and to the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son—. 10. Yea, we sacrifice to Thee, the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son, the holy ritual lord—.

I bless the sacrifice, homage, strength, and swiftness of Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta, and of the Fire, of Ahura Mazda—. And to this one be the glory!

<a id="3"></a>

## III. GÂH UZIREN 

[^1541].

1\. Propitiation to Ahura Mazda! A blessing is Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta—. I confess myself a Mazdayasnian of the order of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, a foe to the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for the Uzayêirina, the holy lord of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise, and for Frâda<i>t</i>\-vîra and Da<i>h</i><i>v</i>yuma, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order, for their sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise. 2. And to that lofty Ahura, Apãm-napâ<i>t</i>, and to the waters which Mazda created be sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise [^1542]! 3, 4. (G. I, 3, 4.) 5. We sacrifice to the Uzayêirina, the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice to the Zaotar, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the Hâvanan, and to the Âtarevakhsha, and to the Frabaretar, and to the Âbere<i>t</i>, and to the Âsnatar, and the Raêthwi<i>s</i>kar, and to the Sraoshâvareza, holy lords of the ritual order. 6.

And we sacrifice to the stars, the moon, and the sun, and to the constellations (?), and we sacrifice to the stars without beginning (to their course?), and to the glory of the doctrinal proclamations <span id="p384">[<sup><small>p. 384</small></sup>]</span> which are the evil man's distress [^1543]. 7. And we sacrifice to the manifest performer of the truth (the correct maintainer of the rites), the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice to the later lore; yea, we sacrifice to the manifest fulfiller of the truth, and to the (entire) creation of the holy (and the clean) by day and by night with Zaothras together with offered prayers, for the sacrifice and homage of Da<i>h</i><i>v</i>yuma, the lord. And we sacrifice to Da<i>h</i><i>v</i>yuma, the holy lord of the ritual order. 8. And we sacrifice to that lofty and royal lord, the brilliant Apãm-napâ<i>t</i> of the fleet horses; and we sacrifice to the water which is Mazda-made and holy. 9, 10. And we sacrifice to thee, the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son [^1544]. 11 [^1545]. And I bless the sacrifice, homage, strength, and swiftness of that lofty Ahura Napâ<i>t</i>\-apãm, and of the water which Mazda created [^1546].
