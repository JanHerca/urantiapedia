## YASNA LXI (SP. LX).

1\. Let us peal [^1308] forth the Ahuna-vairya in our liturgy between the heaven and earth, and let us send forth the Asha Vahi_s_ta in our prayer the same, and the YêNhê hâtãm. And let us send forth in our liturgies between the heaven and earth the pious and good prayer of the pious man for blessings, (2) for the encounter with, and for the displacement of Angra Mainyu with his creatures which are likewise evil as he is, for he is filled with death (for those whom he has made). Aye, let us send that petition forth for the encounter with, and for the dislodgment of the Ka_h__v_aredha [^1309] and of the individual Ka_h__v_aredhas the male, and the female <span id="p313">[<sup><small>p. 313</small></sup>]</span> (to the last individual of each), (3) and for the encounter with, and the dislodgment of the Kayadhas, and of the individual Kayadhians, male and female [^1310], and of the thieves and robbers, of the Zandas [^1311], and the sorcerers, of the covenant breakers, and of those who tamper with the covenants. 4. Yea, we send it forth for the encounter with, and for the overthrow of the murderers of the saints, and of those who hate and torment us for our Faith, and of those who persecute the ritual, and the tyrant full of death. Yea, let us peal them forth for the encounter with, and the overthrow of the wicked, O Zarathu_s_tra Spitama! whoever they may be, whose thoughts, and words, and works are not congenial to the holy ritual laws.

5\. And how shall we drive the Demon of the Lie from hence from us [^1312]? Aye, how shall we, the prophets who are yet to serve and save (thy people), drive the Dru_g_ from hence, so that we, having power over her as being utterly without power, may drive her hence with blow from the seven Karshvars, for the encounter with, and for the dislodgment of the entire evil world [^1313]?
