With a Baresman brought to its appointed place accompanied with the Zaothra at the time of Hâvani, I desire to approach the Myazda-offering with my praise, as it is consumed, and likewise Ameretatâ<i>t</i> [^926] (as the guardian of plants and wood) and Haurvatâ<i>t</i> (who guards the water), with the (fresh) meat [^927], for the propitiation of Ahura Mazda, and of the Bountiful <span id="p208">[<sup><small>p. 208</small></sup>]</span> Immortals, and for the propitiation of Sraosha (who is Obedience) the blessed, who is endowed with sanctity, and who smites with the blow of victory, and causes the settlements to advance.

2\. And I desire to approach Haoma and Parahaoma [^928] with my praise for the propitiation of the Fravashi of Spitâma Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, the saint. And I desire to approach the (sacred) wood with my praise, with the perfume, for the propitiation of thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son!

4\. And I desire to approach this Baresman with the Zaothra with my praise, with its binding [^930] and spread with sanctity for the propitiation of the Bountiful Immortals. And I desire with (?) my voice the thoughts well thought, and the words well spoken, and the deeds well done, and the recital of the Gâthas as they are heard. And I desire to approach the well-said Mãthras with my praise, and this (higher) lordship with this sanctity, and this exact regulation [^931] (of the Ratu), and the reverential prayer for blessings (spoken at the fitting hour); and I desire to approach them for the contentment and propitiation <span id="p209">[<sup><small>p. 209</small></sup>]</span> or the holy Yazads, heavenly and earthly, and for the contentment of each man's soul.

5\. And I desire to approach the Asnya with my praise, the lords of the ritual order, and the Hâvani and Sâvanghi and Vîsya, the holy lords of the ritual order.

20\. And I desire to approach the meat-offering with a Ya<i>s</i>t, and Haurvatâ<i>t</i> (who guards the water), and Ameretatâ<i>t</i> (who guards the plants and wood), with <span id="p212">[<sup><small>p. 212</small></sup>]</span> the Ya<i>s</i>t of the sacred flesh for the propitiation of Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed and the mighty, whose body is the Mãthra, of him of the daring spear, the lordly, the Yazad of the spoken name.

24\. I will confess myself a Mazdayasnian, of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra's order, a foe to the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord for Hâvani, the holy lord of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and for praise, and for Sâvanghi and Vîsya, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order, and for the sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise of the day-lords of the days in their duration, and of the days during daylight, and for the month-regulators, and the year-regulators, and for those of the (several) seasons, for their sacrifice, and homage, their propitiation, and their praise.

(The Zaotar speaks [^934]): As the Ahû to be <span id="p213">[<sup><small>p. 213</small></sup>]</span> (revered and) chosen, let the priest speak [^935] forth to me.

(The Ratu responds): As the Ahû to be (revered and) chosen, let him who is the Zaotar speak [^935] forth to me.

(The Zaotar again): So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned, speak forth!

## Footnotes

[^929]: 207:1 See note on Y. I, 16.

[^930]: 207:2 Spiegel has observed with truth that Ameretatâ<i>t</i> and Haurvatâ<i>t</i> may represent severally all the fruits and the liquids offered.

[^931]: 207:3 The modern Parsis, Haug following, render ‘butter’; but Spiegel is inclined to discredit this later tradition, holding that ‘flesh’ was originally intended; but on its becoming disused in India, milk was substituted, hence the error.
  Gau<i>s</i> hudh<i>a</i>u, in its primary sense, meant of course ‘the Kine of blessed endowment.’ (Repetitions are again curtailed.)

[^932]: 208:1 The Haoma-juice.

[^933]: 208:2 So better than ‘fresh meat.’ Fluids are the chief objects of attention here.

[^934]: 208:3 With its girdle.

[^935]: 208:4 Anghuyãm—rathwãm stand related as ahû and ratu; so also the Pahlavi ahûŏîh and ra<i>d</i>îh, and Ner. svâmitâ<i>m</i><i>k</i>a gurutâ<i>m</i><i>k</i>a.

[^936]: 209:1 Ye<i>s</i>tî seems used of an especial Ya<i>s</i>t here, and subsequently, as genitives intrude among datives, the form possibly taking the place of the words ‘for the propitiation of’; here Ya<i>s</i>t X may be referred to.

[^937]: 209:2 Ya<i>s</i>t XIII.

[^938]: 212:1 So at least the rubric. One would think that the sentence was intended to be dictated to the Ratu to be repeated; that is, if the p. 213 rubric is correct. The sentence as uttered by the priest seems difficult.

[^940]: 213:1 Present, or infin. for imperative (?).
