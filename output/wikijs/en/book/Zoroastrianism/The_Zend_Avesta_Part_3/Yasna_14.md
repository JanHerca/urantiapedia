## YASNA XIV (SP. XV). DEDICATIONS.

1\. I will come to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! as a praiser and a priest, and an invoker and sacrificer, as a memorising reciter and a chanter, for Your sacrifice and homage, which are to be offered to You, the Bountiful Immortals, and for our dedication and sanctification; (yea, for ours) who are the holy prophets (destined to benefit the saints).

2\. And to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals [^1062]! would I dedicate the flesh of my very body [^1063], and all the blessings of a prospered life [^1064].

3\. In this Zaothra with this Baresman, I desire to <span id="p254"><sup><small>[ p. 254 ]</small></sup></span> approach the holy Yazads with my praise [^1065], and all the holy lords of the ritual order at their times, Hâvani at his time, and Sâvanghi and Vîsya at their times. 4. I confess myself a Mazdayasnian, and of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra's order [^1066].

5\. The Zaotar speaks: As an Ahû (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar (?) speaks forth to me (?).

The Ratu speaks: As an Ahû (revered and) to be chosen, the Zaotar speaks forth to me.

The Zaotar: So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned, speak forth!
