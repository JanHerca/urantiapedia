## YASNA LII (SP. LI). A PRAYER FOR SANCTITY AND ITS BENEFITS.

1\. I pray with benedictions for a benefit, and for the good, even for the entire creation of the holy (and the clean); I beseech for them for the (generation which is) now alive, for that which is just coming into life [^1217], and for that which shall be hereafter. And (I pray for that) sanctity which leads to prosperity, and which has long afforded shelter [^1218], which goes on hand in hand with it [^1219], which joins it in its walk, and of itself becoming its close companion as it delivers forth its precepts, (2) bearing every form of healing virtue which comes to us in waters [^1220], appertains to cattle, or is found in plants, and overwhelming all the harmful malice of the Daêvas, (and their servants) who might harm this dwelling [^1221] and its lord, (3) bringing good gifts, and better blessings, given very early, and later (gifts), leading to successes, and for a long time giving shelter [^1222]. And so the greatest, and the best, and most beautiful benefits of sanctity fall likewise to our lot (4) for the sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and the praise of the Bountiful Immortals, for the bringing prosperity to this abode, and for the prosperity of the entire creation of the holy, <span id="p293">[<sup><small>p. 293</small></sup>]</span> and the clean, (and as for this, so) for the opposition of the entire evil creation. (And I pray for this) as I praise through Righteousness, I who am beneficent, chose who are (likewise of a better mind) [^1223]. 5-8. (See Y. VIII, 5-8.) (For Y. LIII, see Gâthas, pp. [190](Gathas_53#p190)\-[194](Gathas_53#p194).)
