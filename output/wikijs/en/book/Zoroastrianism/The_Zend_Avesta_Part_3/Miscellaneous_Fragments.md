## I

1\. (An incitation to the priest or worshipper.) As thou keepest company with the Good Mind, and with Righteousness the Best, and with Khshathra-vairya (the Kingdom to be desired), speak to the male and female disciples of Zarathu_s_tra Spitama the saint, (and declare) the praise which is to be spoken, that of the Yasna, even the words against which no anger [^1561] shall prevail.

2\. And do thou, O Zarathu_s_tra [^1562]! declare our words for sacrifice and worship, ours, the Bountiful Immortals’, that the waters may (thus) be sacrificed to by thee, and the plants, the Fravashis of the saints, and the created Yazads, heavenly and earthly, which are holy and beneficent.

## II

1\. I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper—for the praise of Thraêtaona, the Âthwyan. Let them declare it—Propitiation be to the Fravashi of Thraêtaona, the Âthwyan, the saint. 2. We sacrifice to Thraêtaona, the Âthwyan, the holy lord of the ritual order; and may we be free from the dog Kuro [^1563], and the Tarewani [^1563], and the Karpan, (we who are) of [^1564] those who sacrifice in order. 3. (The Ahuna <span id="p390">[<sup><small>p. 390</small></sup>]</span> follows.) Sacrifice, homage, strength, and swiftness be to the Fravashi of Thraêtaona, the saint. (The Ahem and Ahmâi raê_s__k_a follow.)

## III

1\. All good thoughts, and all good words, and all good deeds are thought, and spoken, and done with intelligence and all evil thoughts, and words, and deeds are thought, and spoken, and done with folly. 2. And let (the men who think, and speak, and do) all good thoughts, and words, and deeds inhabit [^1565] Heaven (as their home). And let those who think, and speak, and do evil thoughts, and words, and deeds abide in Hell. For to all who think good thoughts, speak good words, and do good deeds, Heaven, the best world, belongs. And this is evident, and as of course (?) (or, ‘and therewith their seed’).

## IV

1\. I proclaim the Airy_e_mâ-ishyô as the greatest of all authoritative prayers, O Spitama! as the most influential and helpful for progress; and may the Saoshya_n_ts (who would further us) use it and revere it.

2\. I am speaking in accordance with it, O Spitama! and therefore I shall rule as sovereign over creatures which are mine, I who am Ahura Mazda. Let no one rule as Angra Mainyu [^1566] over realms that are his own, O Zarathu_s_tra Spitama! 3. Let Angra Mainyu be hid beneath the earth [^1567]. Let the Daêvas likewise <span id="p391">[<sup><small>p. 391</small></sup>]</span> disappear. Let the dead arise (unhindered by these foes), and let bodily life be sustained in these now lifeless bodies.

## V

1\. To Ahura Mazda, the radiant, the glorious, to the Bountiful Immortals, to Force well-shaped and stately, to the Blow of Victory, Ahura-given, to the Victorious Ascendency (which it secures), to the path of pleasantness, to the good Zarenuma_n_t [^1568], to the ‘Glowing’ Mountain made by Mazda, and to all the Yazads! 2. We sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the radiant, the glorious, and to the Bountiful Immortals who rule aright, who dispose (of all) aright, and to Force well-shaped and stately, and to the Blow of Victory, and to the Ascendency of Victory, and to the path of pleasantness, and to Zarenuma_n_t, the good, which Mazda created, and to the ‘Glowing’ Mount, and to every saint.

## VI

[^1569].

Propitiation be to the created body of the Kine of blessed endowment, and to the Kine's soul (so, if there is one cow presented [^1570]). Propitiation be to the body and soul of you two (so, if there are two [^1570]).—To your body and soul (if there are three, or the entire herd [^1570]). (The Ahuna follows.)

<span id="p392">[<sup><small>p. 392</small></sup>]</span>

## VII

[^1571].

1\. To the good waters, and to all the waters which Mazda created, and to that lofty lord, Apãm-napâ_t_, and to thee, O Ahurian One of Ahura, that water which Mazda created! be sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise. (The Ahuna follows.) 2. We utter our praises forth to thee, O Ahurian One of Ahura! and we complete good sacrifices, and deeds of adoration, with good gifts of offering, and gifts with praise, which are appropriate to thee among the holy Yazads. I will seek to render thee content. I will pour thee out. \[Let them now recite the lofty Gâthas which belong to the ritual.\]

## VIII

[^1572].

1\. The moons\* of the season will wane. Let the Mazdayasnian (pray) for a smiter who may destroy quickly (the demon who causes their decrease). And quickly indeed may the malignant one die off—. For no one of her adherents can maintain this Dru_g_(k) by prayers.

2\. Smiting fiercely [^1573] with her weapon, she, the Dru_g_(k), goes on, and most mighty she has been. And she wanders on, O Zarathu_s_tra! as mindful of her might, and strong [^1574] in proportion as she advances <span id="p393">[<sup><small>p. 393</small></sup>]</span> as the sinful Dru_g_(k). But may Khshathra [^1575] be with me—, so that . . . . the deadly one may die away, for thereupon the blow of destruction shall come upon the Dru_g_(k) [^1576].

## IX

1\. The Ahuna-vairya is a prayer to be (revered and) chosen as the choice one of Mazda. The Khshathra-vairya is likewise such, and the Yâ daêna [^1577]. They (it) will gain the reward. Yathâ ahû vairyô. It is the word of Mazda. They are the words in season. It is the Mãthra-spe_n_ta word, the unsubdued, the undeceived, the victorious, the opponent of malice, the healing and victorious word of Mazda, which, as it is pronounced [^1578], gives most the victory to him who utters it. 2. I have declared the hymn which is most helpful and victorious against the words of Aêshma, which is health-giving and healing, and conducive to progress, the multiplier, and the furtherer of growth. And let the worshipper present it with a liberal offering . . . . with its pleasing words. Let that be done through veritable grace which helps us on the most [^1579]. The Kingdom (is) to Ahura, which to the poor may grant a nurturer [^1580].

## Footnotes

[^1589]: 389:1 Others ‘the unrestricted words.’

[^1590]: 389:2 Perhaps ‘Zarathu_s_tra’ is here merely the equivalent of priest.

[^1592]: 389:3 Obscure.

[^1593]: 389:4 Awkward formations.
