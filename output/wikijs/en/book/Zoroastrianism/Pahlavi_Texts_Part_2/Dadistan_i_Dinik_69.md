## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXIX.

1\. _As to_ the sixty-eighth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: When _something_ takes hold of the moon _or_ sun what is then its residence (khânŏ), _and_ whence does it always seize upon _it?_

2\. The reply is this, that two dark progeny of the _primeval_ ox [^1] move and are made to revolve from far below the sun and moon, and whenever, during the revolution of the _celestial_ sphere, they make _one_ pass below the sun, or below the moon, it becomes a covering which is spun (ta<i>d</i>) over the sun, _and_ it is so when the sun or moon is not seen. 3. Of each of those two progeny of the _primeval_ ox--one of which is called ‘the head,’ and one ‘the tail’--the motion is specified among astronomers [^2]; but _in_ remaining upon those luminaries, and producing that covering, they do not attain unto those luminaries <span id="p213"><sup><small>[ p. 213 ]</small></sup></span> within that covering. 4. _There_ occurs no difference whatever of the descending _rays_ [^3] from those luminaries into a place of purity and freedom from disturbance far below those luminaries, except this, that the light which they divert to the world, and their activity as regards the _celestial_ spheres are not complete _for_ so much time, _nor_ the coming [^4] of the light to the earth.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (212:1) Supposing the reading should be 2-ân gô<i>k</i>îhar-î târ here, and 2-ân gô<i>k</i>îharân in § 3. Gô<i>k</i>îhar is a supposed planetary (and, therefore, malevolent) body, connected with the sun and moon and having a head and tail, which falls on to the earth at the resurrection (see Bd. V, 1, XXVIII, 44, XXX, 18), and is here described as the cause of eclipses. Its name implies that it sprang from, or contained, the seed of the primeval ox, the supposed source of animal life (see Bd. XIV, 3), and in its Av. form, gao<i>k</i>ithra, it is a common epithet of the moon; in Pers. it has become gôzihr or gava<i>z</i>kihr. As the words stand in K35 they look more like 2 andô<i>g</i> dâlan-î târ, ‘two dark store-lobbies,’ or 2 andô<i>g</i> gâl-î târ, ‘two clusters of dark spiders;’ and in § 3 the word han<i>k</i>înŏ is substituted for the nearly synonymous andô<i>g</i>. In M14 the words seem to be 2 ângûn <i>k</i>îharânŏ-î târ, ‘two such dark faces.’

[^2]: (212:2) M14 has ‘in the calculations of astronomers.’

[^3]: (213:1) Literally ‘fallers.’

[^4]: (213:2) Assuming that mâ<i>d</i>ârîh stands-for ma<i>d</i>ârîh. The meaning is that an eclipse produces no harm beyond a short interruption of the descent of the sun‘s or moon’s rays to the earth.
