## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LI.

1\. The fiftieth question is that which you ask thus: _As to one_ of the good religion who drinks wine immoderately, and loss _and_ injury happen to him owing to that immoderate drinking, what is then the decision about him? 2. And how is the measure of wine-drinking _which_ when they drink is then authorised for them?

3\. The reply is this, that whoever through the influence of opportunity drinks wine immoderately, _and_ is adult and intelligent, through every loss _and_ injury which thereupon come to him from that immoderate drinking, or _which_ occasion anything unto any one, is then his causing such pollution to the creatures, in his own pleasurably [^1] varied modes, that the shame owing to it is a help (dastakîh) out of that affliction. 4. And even _he_ who gives wine authorisedly [^2] unto any one, and he is thereby intoxicated by it, is equally guilty of every sin which that drunkard commits owing to that drunkenness.

5\. And concerning that drunkenness, what is said is that that is to be eaten _through_ which, when _one_ eats _it, one_ thinks better, speaks better, and acts <span id="p179"><sup><small>[ p. 179 ]</small></sup></span> better; and such even is the food _by_ which, through _having_ drunk wine, _one_ becomes more virtuous, or does not become more vicious, in thought, word, and deed. 6. When an experiment as regards its _being_ good is tried, so that _having_ drunk it in that proportion _one_ becomes better, or does not become worse, then it is allowable to drink _it_.

7\. When an untried _person_, for the sake of _being_ tried, _has_ drunk a mingled portion, first of one drinking-cup [^1], secondly of two drinking-cups, _and_ thirdly of three drinking-cups, _and_ through drinking _it_ he becomes more virtuous, or does not become more vicious, in thought [^2], word, _or_ deed, _he_ is to increase the drinking-cups, and the experiment is allowable unto those tested just so far as the proportion is _such_ that he becomes better, or does not become worse. 8. To those tested _it_ is authorisedly _given_ to that amount through which the experimenting that is mentioned _has_ extended; and to _him_ who _it_ is proved will become worse through the drinking of wine, that amount, through the drinking of which, _when_ given [^3] in the experiment, _it was_ seen that he became worse, is not authorisedly given.

9\. In a case of doubt _one_ is to consider _him who is_ orthodox (hû-dînô), who _has_ chanted the _sacred_ hymns, _and is_ of good. repute, whose drunkenness <span id="p180"><sup><small>[ p. 180 ]</small></sup></span> is not manifest, in this _way_, that he drinks as much wine as _was_ tried by him when he became no worse _by_ drinking _it_. 10. It is necessary to consider _him whose_ religion is unseen, whose religion is wrong, and him who is a child furnished even with the realities of religion, in this _way_, that he becomes worse through _having_ drunk wine. 11. When _apart_ from the decision there is no assignable (ban<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nîk) reason as regards _it_, the share of wine which they gave not authorisedly who themselves drank wine, _one_ considers as _some of_ the wine on _its being_ given more authorisedly [^1].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (178:1) K35 has a blank space here for a word, but no word seems really necessary. M14 fills up the blank by changing gvî<i>d</i>ŏ into gar<i>d</i>îni<i>d</i>ŏ, and reads ‘converted unto his own pleasure, and the mode,’ &c.

[^2]: (178:2) M14 has ‘unauthorisedly,’ a very natural emendation of the text as it stands in K35, but it does not appear that the author intended to limit the responsibility of the person giving the wine merely to those cases in which his action would be quite unjustifiable.

[^1]: (179:1) Reading â<i>v</i> <i>g</i>âmakŏ, ‘water-cup;’ but it is written like â<i>v</i> sîmakŏ in the MSS.

[^2]: (179:2) K35 has mân, M14 mîni<i>s</i>nŏ.

[^3]: (179:3) Reading vehabûntŏ instead of the unintelligible <i>g</i>ân bû<i>d</i>ŏ of K35, the alteration being merely lengthening the bottom stroke of the Pahl. b. M14 substitutes ba<i>r</i>â yehevûnê<i>d</i> for bû<i>d</i>ŏ <i>g</i>ân bû<i>d</i>ŏ, which gives the following meaning: ‘through the drinking of which, in the experiment, _it is_ seen that he becomes thoroughly worse.’

[^1]: (180:1) The meaning appears to be that, when there is no special reason to the contrary, the quantity of wine one may have already drunk elsewhere is to be considered as part of one's allowance.
