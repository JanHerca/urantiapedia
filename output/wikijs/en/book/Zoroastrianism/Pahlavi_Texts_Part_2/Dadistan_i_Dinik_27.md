## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. The twenty-sixth question is that which you ask thus: How are the nature of hell, _and_ the pain, discomfort [^1], punishment, and stench of hell?

2\. The reply is this, that _it is_ sunken, deep, and descending, most dark, most stinking, and most terrible, most _supplied with_ wretched existences (anâzî<i>d</i>ântûm), and most bad, the place and cave <span id="p58"><sup><small>[ p. 58 ]</small></sup></span> (grêstakŏ) of the demons and fiends. 3. And in it is no comfort, pleasantness, _or_ joy whatever; _but_ in it are all stench, filth, pain, punishment, distress, profound evil, and discomfort; and _there_ is no resemblance of it whatever _to_ worldly stench, filthiness, pain, and evil. 4. And since _there_ is no resemblance of the mixed evil of the world to that which is its sole-indicating (aê-numâî) good, _there_ is also a deviation (gumi<i>s</i>nŏ) of it from the origin and abode of evil [^2].

5\. And so much more grievous is the evil in hell than even the most grievous evil on earth, as the greatness of the spiritual _existence_ is _more_ than _that of_ the world; and more grievous is the terror of the punishment on the soul than that of the vileness of the demons on the body. 6. And the punishment on the soul is from those whose abode _it has_ become [^3], from the demons and darkness--a likeness of that evil to hell--the head (kamârakŏ) of whom is Aharman the deadly.

7\. And the words of the expressive utterance of the high-priests are these, that where _there_ is a fear of every other thing _it_ is more than the thing itself, _but_ hell is a thing worse than the fear _of it_.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (57:2) Or ‘ingloriousness.’

[^2]: (58:1) Meaning, probably, that the mixture of good and evil in the world is as far removed from heaven as it is from hell. But the words aê-numâî and gumi<i>s</i>nŏ are doubtful both in reading and meaning.

[^3]: (58:2) That is, hell has become; reading man ga<i>s</i>tŏ.
