## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXXVI.

1\. _As to_ the eighty-fifth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: What is possible to become the harm of a gift _that_ is reduced?

2\. The reply is this, that since _those things_ are to be properly given which are for the religious rites of the ceremonial [^1], and are the consideration of the undertakers of all the religious rites, and are also the stipend of some solemnizers, both [^2] are living comfortably _by_ the ceremonial. 3. The sons of the disciples _who_ wanted approval for the words prayed, become so much the more to be ordered _and_ to be accepted; and the ceremonial of all the religious rites becomes more progressive.

4\. So, moreover, when they go to undertake the well-operating activity of the ceremonial for a diminution of remuneration _and_ gift, and owing to undertaking _and_ ordering again [^3], by way of routine (pavan dôr râs), they do not request so much stipend, _it is_ as though they should buy my linen _and_ should sell _it_ again for their own payment (dâ<i>d</i>anŏ). 5. _As to_ the performers of the ceremonial, likewise, who _have_ to acquire approval with much trouble and words prayed, and obtain a remuneration which, _for_ the soul even, is as little for the ceremonial as though _one were_ annoyed—whereby <span id="p249"><sup><small>[ p. 249 ]</small></sup></span> living is difficult—they become sorry for enduring the trouble, owing to lukewarmness (afsur<i>d</i>ŏ-mini<i>s</i>nîh) _in_ the same profession. 6. And even the sons of the disciples shall sell linen for wages, and they rejoice _that_ it is possible to learn other callings _with_ less pains; and thus they make _them_ become lukewarm _and_ meditating retreat (a<i>v</i>â<i>z</i>âhang) from the words of fresh paragraphs continually prayed [^4], from the approval requested of the learned (â<i>z</i>ân), _and_ from all the religious rites they should undertake _for_ the contented.

7\. _As to_ those, moreover, who, through fervent-minded undertaking of _what_ is ordered, request less _for_ all the religious rites, _and have_ not obtained [^5] even that which is due _to them_, it is not even as though they ordered _of them_ for the fiends [^6]. 8. And the disgrace, too, of the orderers of good works of lukewarmness is the exaltation of the profession of the disciples; and its deficient progress becomes the paralysation of the ceremonial of the sacred beings for saving the souls of the good from the deadly _one_ (mar).
