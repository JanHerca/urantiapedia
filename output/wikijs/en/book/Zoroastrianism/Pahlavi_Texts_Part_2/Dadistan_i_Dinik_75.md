## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXV.

1\. _As to_ the seventy-fourth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: Do the angels have _his_ dead _body_ restored, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that _there_ was a high-priest who said that the angels do not have _his_ dead _body_ restored, because of the sin of the mutually-polluting, full of stench, and inglorious victims (khvâpî<i>d</i>ŏân) [^1], the terrible kind of means for the exculpation of creatures [^2], and that practice when males keep specially imperfect in _their_ duty; it _being_ then suitable for mankind to become _free_ from him who--like A<i>z</i>\-î Dahâk [^3], who wanted many most powerful demons--resists _and_ struggles, and is not possessing the perception to extract (patka<i>s</i>istanŏ) a pardon, owing to the course of many demoniacal causes. 3. But innumerable multitudes (amarakânîhâ), happily persevering [^4] in diligence, have with united observation, unanimously, _and_ with mutual assistance (ham-ban<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nîhâ) insisted upon this, that they have the dead _bodies_ of all men restored; for <span id="p223"><sup><small>[ p. 223 ]</small></sup></span> the good creator, granting forgiveness _and_ full of goodness, would not abandon any creature to the fiend [^5]. 4. In revelation (dînô) it is said that every dead _body_ is raised up, both of the righteous and of the wicked [^6]; _there_ is none whom they shall abandon to the fiend.

5\. And this, also, is thus decided by them [^7], that even _as to_ him _who_ is most grievously sinful, when he becomes mentally _seeking_ pardon _and_ repentant of the sin, _and, being_ as much an atoner as _he_ is well able, _has_ delivered _up his_ body _and_ wealth for retribution _and_ punishment, in reliance upon the atonement for sin of the good religion, then it is possible _for_ his soul, also, to come to the place of the righteous [^8].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (222:1) Victims of the deceptions practised by the demons (see Chaps. LXXIII, 3, LXXIV, 3); but the reading is uncertain.

[^2]: (222:2) Probably the punishment of the wicked in hell.

[^3]: (222:3) See Chap. XXXVII, 97.

[^4]: (222:4) Reading farukhvŏ-tûshi<i>s</i>n, but it may be perkhûntŏ dahi<i>s</i>n, ‘_having_ begged the boon;’ and M14 has pôryô<i>d</i>keshânŏ, ‘_of_ those of the primitive faith.’

[^5]: (223:1) Except for temporary punishment in hell. All ideas of the vindictiveness of implacable justice are foreign to the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper's notion of the good creator.

[^6]: (223:2) Compare Bd. XXX, 7.

[^7]: (223:3) Probably by the ‘multitudes’ of § 3.

[^8]: (223:4) By delivering up his body and wealth to the will of the high-priest, as an atonement, and mentally renouncing his sins, he is saved from hell, and the beneficial effect of any good works he may have performed returns to him (see Sls. VIII, 5).
