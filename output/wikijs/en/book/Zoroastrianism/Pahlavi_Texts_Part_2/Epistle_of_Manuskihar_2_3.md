## EPISTLE II. TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER III.

1\. _It_ is disquieting about this, too, which is declared in your writing [^1], as regards _your_ vehement desire and embarrassment (rûzdîh) for a new law, and _your_ wish and longing. for the establishment of the law of the apostles [^2]; as also that which you _have_ done about the gathering of the details of statements from the three teachings [^3], _and_ about <span id="p337"><sup><small>[ p. 337 ]</small></sup></span> causing the rapid bringing of the new law. 2. And on account of your embarrassment and wrong-_doing_ (va<i>d</i>ag) they would give up the Frasnât<i>e</i>ê (‘washing upwards [^4]) and Upasnât<i>e</i>ê (’washing downwards'), to bring the fifteen _times_ which are without ordinance (ba<i>r</i>â âînakŏ), that are after it [^5], back to the fifteen which are a portion of the ordinance (âînakŏ vâî).

3\. _As to_ the three times, each of which times _one_ runs a mile (hâsar) even until he obtains a purifier [^6], since peradventure thy mile (parasang), too, _might_ become more, all the good work is written purposely (a<i>g</i>\-karîhâ) of three miles and more [^7]. 4. And that, too, which the high-priests have so appointed, when _he has_ striven in that manner for three persons [^8], or that sin and retribution of his is apportioned unto them _and_ brought to the balance (san<i>g</i>ag-âînî<i>d</i>ŏ), is because that commission and retribution of sin _might_ now, peradventure, be <span id="p338"><sup><small>[ p. 338 ]</small></sup></span> allotted unto the priest [^9]; for if _he were_ impure (pali<i>s</i>tŏ) there _would_ be no one whatever who would properly perform the purification as it is necessary.

5\. Then it _has_ become indispensable _for_ you to perform the purification, for that operation—so suitable for the discreet where ‘he who _has been_ by the dead [^10],’ so that he has become polluted, and even ‘the stars and moon and sun shine upon his life discontentedly’—is just as fit for the exalted when there is great ‘propitiation of fire, water, earth, cattle, righteous males, and righteous women’ thereby. 6. So great is _its_ value _that_ where there is no purification _of_ the body _it_ is not possible to purify the life _and_ soul; _and_ when there is a man in a realm who is able to perform it, that man is not justifiable except when he shall perform _it_.

7\. Finally, when that pre-eminent operation is _being_ accomplished, over which _there_ is in revelation and the perfect information due to revelation that supreme [^11] control which you are so disputing in the religion—which even through your trifling (khûr<i>d</i>akŏ) in the name of authority is becoming a struggle (patkâr-yehevûn)—then, though it may not be possible for you to perform _it_ yourself, it should thereupon be the duty of some one of your _disciples_ to perform it in your sight, so that you _may_ be aware of the rite, even apart from the great resources in _that_ most learned (â<i>z</i>tûm) acquaintance <span id="p339"><sup><small>[ p. 339 ]</small></sup></span> with revelation which is associated with you [^12]. 8. Also from that which is repeatedly written by you with understanding of the rite, as regards all three teachings [^13], _it_ is manifest those rites are mentioned even _as_ those _which_ are more maintained, _and_ are not those which are unnecessary to perform. 9. You are a something therein that _tends_ to preserve [^14] a little _of_ what it is not possible for thee to attain fully in any mode; when thou shalt obtain the operations of the voice [^15], and the water and bull's urine, as well as the three men [^16], or thou shalt give a man [^17] to wash therein, the intellect of those controlling is then, indeed, not preservative therein.

10\. It is proper also for you to consecrate the water _and_ bull‘s urine by that ritual which is in all three teachings, to prepare your own ritualistic liquid _and_ other _things_ which are approved among you with mutual assistance, _and_ to appoint a purifier who _has_ performed fully acceptably _and_ been wanted. 11. Then, to give _out_ properly to the country that the purification, is according to my order, I always <span id="p340"><sup><small>[ p. 340 ]</small></sup></span> perform _it_ more acceptably than that of other purifiers. 12. For the water _and_ bull’s urine are all consecrated by me, and the three hundred pebbles (sang [^18]) are cast into them (aûba<i>s</i>) by me, just as it is directed; the operation is also directed by me in the three days [^19] when it is performed, and all the customary _parts_ are washed three times by me [^20]; the ablution seats (makŏ) are also arranged by me anew for every single person, and the use of washed seats is not ordered by me therein [^21]; every rite of the washing by the purifier is also so performed by me as all three teachings have mentioned as perfection. 13. You become the best of the district, as regards the minutiae (bârîkî<i>d</i>ôân) of the purification that is within your duty, so long as they excite the sight [^22], _but_ which are curtailed (kazd) by you in the way of washing disclosed to me [^23], while, when it should be performed by you in this manner, your performance would be equally constantly extolled _and_ your writing praised.

14\. When, then, you write of it that they should always perform it just as now, the falsity therein is <span id="p341"><sup><small>[ p. 341 ]</small></sup></span> grievous (yagar), and I know none worse; for this washing and professional purification which _one_ is to keep in operation—as is declared by revelation, the teaching of high-priests, and those of the primitive faith who are esteemable [^24]\—you withdraw (madam dârê<i>d</i>ŏ) from the midst _of us_. 15. That _which_ you understand yourself is that unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the confederate good creatures are as _it were_ defiled _and_ in the eyes of the good _and_ wise _they are_ as _it were_ propitiatory towards the mischievous Vâê [^25]. 16. And your words about it are just as they say concerning a beggar [^26], where a garment is given to him, thus: ‘Wash the dirt (âlûg) on him thoroughly clean;’ _and_ that garment they shall take is put upon the fire _and_ burnt; and he spoke thus: ‘My dirt _was_ a comfort.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (336:3) The decree mentioned in Chap. II, 1.

[^2]: (336:4) That is, the new law which the future apostles, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, and Sôshâns (see Dd. II, 10) are expected to bring, so as to restore the religion in preparation for the resurrection.

[^3]: (336:5) Those of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, Afarg, and Sôshâns (see Ep. I, v, 1, 6).

[^4]: (337:1) These terms are quoted from Vend. VIII, 276, 279 (see App. V), and are thus explained in Pahlavi in Chap. IV, 2.

[^5]: (337:2) Referring, apparently, to the second mention‘ of the fifteen washings, in Pahl. Vend. VIII, 281, which does not occur in the Avesta text (’the ordinance'), but refers to its previous occurrence in § 279 of the Avesta. But, perhaps, the author means that they would confound the final washing appointed in Vend. VIII, 299 with the preliminary washing appointed in the previous § 279.

[^6]: (337:3) See Vend. VIII, 280, 287, 295 (compare App. V and Ep. I, ii, 6, note).

[^7]: (337:4) After the polluted person has thrice run a mile, he is to run further (see Vend. VIII, 294) to some inhabited spot; from which directions the author concludes that any excess of distance is immaterial. K35 and BK have ‘four miles and more,’ but this seems to be a copyist's blunder.

[^8]: (337:5) To purify him, and, if they refuse, they each take a share of his sin (see Vend. VIII, 280-293),

[^9]: (338:1) Who is to purify him finally with the Bareshnûm ceremony.

[^10]: (338:2) Referring to Vend. IX, 161-1 63, quoted at length in Ep. I, iv, 3.

[^11]: (338:3) Reading mahîstô, but it can also be read Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>ayastô, ‘Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping.’

[^12]: (339:1) That is, even when not performing the ceremony himself, his presence would be desirable, for the sake of securing due attention to all the details, with which his superior knowledge must make him better acquainted than his subordinates.

[^13]: (339:2) See § 1.

[^14]: (339:3) Reading bûkhtanŏ; the MSS. divide the word, so as to convert it into ba<i>r</i>â tanû,‘ without a body.’ The meaning is that by his presence he is, at all events, able to secure some efficiency in the ceremony, when he is compelled to intrust its performance to subordinates who are not fully competent.

[^15]: (339:4) In the prayers and exorcisms.

[^16]: (339:5) See § 4.

[^17]: (339:6) That is, one thoroughly qualified (the priest mentioned in § 4) who requires no special supervision.

[^18]: (340:1) See Ep. I, vii, 16.

[^19]: (340:2) The ‘three washings’ mentioned in Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>o</i> (see App. IV); referring probably to those after the third, sixth, and ninth nights (see Vend. IX, 136, 140, 144), that is, on the fourth, seventh, and tenth days of the Bareshnûm ceremony. Most of this clause is omitted in J.

[^20]: (340:3) As said to have been directed by Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh (see Chap. 71, 6, Ep. I, vi, 7), though the extant Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i> (IX, 132, <i>j</i>) attributes the order to Afarg.

[^21]: (340:4) Compare Ep. I, ix, 7, Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, o, s.

[^22]: (340:5) J has ‘so long as they advance the purification as much as possible by a resemblance so approved,’

[^23]: (340:6) In the heretical decree under consideration.

[^24]: (341:1) That is, by the Avesta and Zand.

[^25]: (341:2) Reading anâkŏ Vâê; he is the demon that carries off the soul (see Dd. XXX, 4). Even the best creatures are imperfect in the eyes of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the righteous.

[^26]: (341:3) Reading niyâ<i>z</i>kar, instead of the niyâ<i>z</i>ar, of the MSS.
