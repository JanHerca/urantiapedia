## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXIX.

1\. The twenty-eighth question is that you ask thus: For what reason is it not allowable to perform <span id="p61"><sup><small>[ p. 61 ]</small></sup></span> the ceremony of Srôsh, the living spirit (ahvô) [^1], _along_ with other propitiations (shnûmanŏ) [^2], when they reverence him separately?

2\. The reply is this, that the lord of all _things_ is the creator who is persistent over his own creatures, and a precious work is his own true service [^3] which is given by him to Srôsh the righteous whom, for this reason, _one_ is to reverence separately when even his name is not frequently mentioned, and _one_ is not even to reverence the names of the archangels with him.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (61:1) Probably a miswriting of ashôk, ‘righteous.’

[^2]: (61:2) Short formulas of praise, reciting all the usual titles of the spirits intended to be propitiated by them, which are introduced into a particular part of the liturgy to dedicate the ceremony to the particular spirit in whose honour it is being performed (see Sls. VII, 8).

[^3]: (61:3) Reading bôndakîh; but it may be bûndakîh, ‘completeness, perfection.’
