## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXX.

1\. _As to_ the seventy-ninth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: Concerning him who does not order _ceremonies_ what is then the decision?

2\. The reply is this, that, excepting those. among which is specially the selected religious rite (dînô) of him whose ceremony is not performed—who, even though _having_ many good works, does not afterwards attain unto the supreme heaven, which is determined [^1]\—this, moreover, is thus said, that he who is not able to perform his ritual himself, when he orders a Gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> [^2] _ceremony_ and they shall perform _it_, can become _fit_ for the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânîkŏ); this is greatly to be commended.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (237:1) It is the general opinion that if the proper ceremonies are not performed during the three days after a death (see Chap. XXVIII) the deceased cannot attain to the highest grade of heaven; this is, however, denied by some of the commentators (see Sls. VI, 3-6).

[^2]: (237:2) See Chap. LXXIX, 4 n.
