## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXXII.

1\. _As to_ the eighty-first question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: _As to_ a man who shall order a ceremonial _and_ shall give the money (diram), and the man who shall undertake his ceremonial <span id="p243"><sup><small>[ p. 243 ]</small></sup></span> and shall take his money, _but has_ not performed the ceremonial, what is then the decision and what is then the decision _about_ the man who ordered the ceremonial?

2\. The reply is this, that the merit of a ceremonial not performed is not set going, and does not come to the soul of the undertaker who shall take money for it, _nor_ even _to_ that of the orderer who gave money for it. 3. But, _as to_ him who is the orderer, since his mental meritoriousness is so steadfast that he gave his money, the efficacy (tûban) of the good work, mentally his own, _has_ not stayed _away_ from him, because he gave money authorisedly for the good work; the decision, then, _about_ him is such as _about him_ to whom harm occurs in performing a good work for the religion. 4. It is said that the angels so recompense him that he does not consider it as _any_ other harm; and as much as the good money given [^1] for the sacred feast [^2] _and_ ceremonial is then the pleasure _which_ comes unto his soul, as much as would have been possible to arise in the world from that money.

5\. And he who shall take his money, and did not perform his ceremonial, is just as though he had abstracted from the angels [^3] and the righteous guardian spirits, _and_ destroyed, as much propitiation as would have been possible from that ceremonial; and he is, therefore, overwhelmed by it [^4], and expiates _it_ in the soul.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (243:1) M14 has ‘the money given by him,’ which may be correct.

[^2]: (243:2) See Chap, XLVII, I.

[^3]: (243:3) K35 has ‘the good.’

[^4]: (243:4) Or, we might perhaps read ‘thereby. it is his overwhelming (astarî<i>d</i>ŏ),’ supposing astarî<i>d</i>ŏ to be a technical term implying a p. 244 flogging, as appears probable from a passage in Farh. Okh. p. 34, 11. 1, 2, which, when restored to its form in the oldest MSS., runs as follows:—Astarî<i>d</i>anô â<i>s</i>kârîh astaraspân sna<i>s</i> pavan vinâs, which may be translated ‘the manifestation of “overwhelming” is the blow of horsewhips for sin;’ assuming that astarasp is equivalent to aspô a<i>s</i>tar, the usual translation of Av. aspahê a<i>s</i>traya, ‘with a horsewhip.’
