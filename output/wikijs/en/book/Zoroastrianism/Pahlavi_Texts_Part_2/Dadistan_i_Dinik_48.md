## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XLVIII.

1\. The forty-seventh question is that which you ask thus: How is a liking for the desirableness, joy, and pleasure _arising_ from the sacred ceremony (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n) friendly to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the archangels [^1], and the guardian spirits of the righteous [^2]; in what manner is the perfection of him by whom the ceremony is ordered and the people of the country then exalted by them; and how _and_ in what manner does it become the vexation, defeat, anguish, _and_ discomfort of the evil spirit, the demons, _and_ the fiends? 2. How is the purpose of the ceremony, what is the ceremony, where is the place [^3] when they shall perform _it_, what is good when they shall <span id="p160"><sup><small>[ p. 160 ]</small></sup></span> perform _it, and_ how _is it_ good when they shall perform _it?_ 

3\. The reply is this, that the great satisfaction of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels _arising_ from the sacred ceremony is in the purity of its formulary (nîrang), _and_ also in this, that _it_ is completely fulfilling his own blessed commands; because he ordered that entire goodness for the complete procedure of those of the good religion (bûndakŏ hitdînakânakîh), _as_ the recompense and full allotment of the sure upholder of religion _among_ those who rightly recite _it_. 4. From the performance of the ceremonial of the sacred beings are the propitiation of the good spirits, the destruction (drû<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) of violence, the increase of digestiveness, the growth of plants, the prosperity of the world, _and_ also the proper progress of living beings, even until the movement of the renovation _of the universe and_ the immortality of the creatures arise therefrom. 5. It became _so_, it is expressly said, because the sacred beings are great; and unitedly opposing it the demons are particularly undesirous _of it_, and owing to it their defeat _and_ vexation are severe; its _consecrated_ cup (tâ<i>s</i>tîkŏ) [^4] also becomes the express preservation of the ceremony.

6\. And its purpose enquired about is this, that religion is transmitted clearly to the intelligent, that is, _it is_ not the wisdom whose comprehension _exists_ in worldly beings; and as, moreover, even that which is not understood by worldly wisdom is really the <span id="p161"><sup><small>[ p. 161 ]</small></sup></span> creature of the spirits, that also which is the spiritual formulary (nîrang) is for making _it_ intelligible to worldly beings through the body [^5]. 7. That religion which is comprehensible by the world _and_ authoritative (nikê<i>z</i>akŏ) is rightly connected with that which worldly beings are quite able to understand through worldly wisdom; and the understanding about its evidence as to that which is spiritual _and_ powerful, apart from the worldly evidence of superiors (a<i>v</i>arîkânŏ), is the right way of the intelligent. 8. That proper (kânŏ) purpose—in which, more-over, the ceremonial, owing to timely memory for its own completion, is unique—is this unique exhibition of purity in the pure glorifying of the heavenly angels, as is commanded; just as the purpose of the ceremonial of a season-festival _being_ before the season-festival, _and_ of maintaining (dârân) the exposure of the body of a jackal (<i>s</i>akhâl) [^6] _or_ a man, is to make the body clean from the corrupting (nasû<i>s</i>îkŏ) pollution [^7], _and_ also from outward contamination.

9\. That also which might be written, as to the much retribution appointed as regards washing the limbs outside with clean moisture from clean <span id="p162"><sup><small>[ p. 162 ]</small></sup></span> animals [^8] _and_ plants, and then completely washing the body with the purifying water streaming forth; as to the clean scents among those which they rightly perceive, and making the body _and_ clothing [^9] sweet-scented; _and_ as to the putting on of the white and proper garment of Vohûman [^10], and supposing the power [^11] of avarice _to be_ the sight of distress, is _all_ superfluous. 10. _But it_ is needful still as regards these _matters_, that is, while _engaged_ in the ceremonial _it is_ not to be hurried owing to any hunger _or_ thirst, owing to liability of punishment for religious practices [^12], _or_ even owing to deficiency [^13] of vacant space. 11. And before the ceremonial _one_ is to eat at the appropriate time, and such food, too, as is preparable and _only_ moderately troublesome (navâs); and any of that which _one has_ to perform aloud in leaving the heavenly-minded, yet moderate, duty in the abode of fires [^14]\—which is perpetual light—is proper, pertaining to good works, and good for him, and thereby lodging in _him_. 12. And they, that is, <span id="p163"><sup><small>[ p. 163 ]</small></sup></span> the gloomy ones [^15], thereby see the service (yasâk) for them themselves is short; _and_ good are _they_ [^16] who come into the world glorified by praise.

13\. The position of the _ceremony_\-holders [^17] themselves, that is, the position of the officiating priest (zôtŏ) _and_ his co-operators, is the Aûrvês [^18] place; and, if _it be_ the precinct (dargasîh) of prayers [^19], _one_ should wash _it_ over (madam pasâyâ<i>d</i>) _with_ the water of purification, to make _it_ clean. 14. The apparatus of the ceremonial, _together_ with its own man, who is a solemnizer, and the two creatures _which_ are solid [^20] out of these four: fire, metal, water, and plants, just as _one has_ to bring _them_ together in readiness, the stone Aûrvês, the stone _and_ mortar Khân [^21], _and_ the Hôm-mortar [^22] (hâvanîh), cups, _and_ crescent-shaped (mâh-rûpŏ) stands [^23] set upon _it_, are _all_ ceremoniously washed (pâ<i>d</i>yâ<i>v</i>înî<i>d</i>) with the water of purification. 15. The <span id="p164"><sup><small>[ p. 164 ]</small></sup></span> bright fire on the clean fire-stand (âtî<i>s</i>tŏ) [^24] is increased by the dry firewood delivered _to it_ purified, _and one_ is to put upon _it at_ appropriate times the wholesome perfumes of _various_ kinds of plants; and the water of purification, which is ritualistically produced [^25] by _reciting_ the words of revelation, is in the clean metal cups. 16. The well-grown Hôm [^26] through which the world is possessed of creatures [^27], the Hôm through which the production of Zaratû<i>s</i>t occurred [^28], is a symbol of the white Gôkerânô [^29] as <span id="p165"><sup><small>[ p. 165 ]</small></sup></span> regards the immortality of the renovation _of the universe_ manifest therefrom, and the resting-places of its vengeance [^30] are the various demons; and with it _one_ is to put attentively (<i>s</i>invi<i>s</i>nŏ-dahak) in _its_ appropriate place the pomegranate (hadanapag) [^31] plant of the Aûrvarâm. 17. The vegetable [^32] sacred twigs carefully girded with the vegetable belt (parvand) and girdle, _and_ the metallic [^33] crescent-shaped _stands_\—which are in the position of those who are sovereigns _of_ the worldly creatures who are interpreted _as_ the sacred twigs [^34] of the treatises—are prepared.

18\. _When_ arranged (stôrdŏ) by the bringing together of clean worldly productions, so much the more purely as is possible, the arrival of the pure renders all the symbols reliable. 19. Those celebrators of whom the outside of their own bodies is defiled with their bodily refuse and in clean clothing, and _their_ disposition—if [^35] in the religion of <span id="p166"><sup><small>[ p. 166 ]</small></sup></span> moderate eating in which is a thirst for lawfully drinking—is customarily sleep _and_ lethargy through the tendency (rûnŏ) to falsehood of _their_ wisdom, are to consider, even from _their_ innermost hearts and minds, the retribution of the body of wrath, the falsehood, and bad thoughts in that disposition of infamy, _and_ the recompense of their own renunciation _of it; they_ are to atone for _their_ sinfulness, _and_ to seek great purification of mind. 20. And _having_ acquired eyes speaking [^36] forth, hands in _a state of_ ablution, and every other member of the body—especially there where well-accomplishable—_free_ from its bodily refuse and covered _with_ the clean clothing, the tongue is preserved _and_ guarded _from_ falsehood _and_ the hand from sin, the mind is established _by_ little preparation with good consideration for knowledge of the sacred beings, and even the good are to recite by direction (ra<i>d</i>îhâ) the verbal renunciation _of sin_ [^37].

21\. The officiating priest (zôtŏ), _having_ directed _and_ purified the place [^38] of the fire with liturgical words [^39], is to go _and_ walk unto the place of the officiating priests [^40] while glorifying the sacred beings, <span id="p167"><sup><small>[ p. 167 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ to consider invokable the glory given to the luminaries and the guardian spirits of the good. 22. Of those [^41] also who, co-operatively, conjointly, and interspersed (ham-rê<i>s</i>), _have_ each separately remained in their own places _and_ thought of the sacred beings, with propitiation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _and_ scornful notice (tar dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the evil spirit, the employment stands forth prominently at the ceremonial. 23. _As to_ the position of others co-operating _with_ him who is an officiating priest of good leadership, there are _some_ who are for the Avesta [^42], there is the solitude (khadûî<i>d</i>ârîh) by the fire, there are _some_ who are bringers [^43] forward of water, there are _some_ who are for carriers away, there are _some_ who are solitary ones, there are _some_ who are gregarious ones, there are _some_ who are directors of duties, and their own needful arrangement in the place is arranged in the ceremony.

24\. In cleanliness, purity, _and_ truth, as much as _there is_ in _this_ mingled existence [^44], if _one has_ to commence a ceremony glorifying the sacred beings, <span id="p168"><sup><small>[ p. 168 ]</small></sup></span> when the righteously-disposed temperament is purified _along_ with the apparatus the abundant ritualism (nîrangakîh) of the spirit is a symbol _and_ reminder of the will of the sacred beings, undesired by the fiend [^45], _and_ remains a blessing deservedly unto those come together. 25. Then is explained the text (a<i>v</i>istâk) of that great scripture (naskô) which is called the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht [^46], _that_ is itself the best of the chiefs of the scriptures, _and_ of the sublime Dvâ<i>z</i>dah-hômâst [^47] _that_ is not recited by any voice with falsehood (âkadbâ) [^48], _and_ is called the origin of every truth [^49].'

26\. The pure glorification of the sacred beings is in the light, this is in the morning time (frâyar gâs) [^50]; and even until night the ritualistic _and_ true <span id="p169"><sup><small>[ p. 169 ]</small></sup></span> recitation of revelation (dînô) is unchangeably proceeding, undivided and faultless. 27. This, too, is in benediction of the angels; this, too, is producing restraint of the fiends; this, too, is in praise of the glorious ones, the mighty doers; this, too, is as an admonition. for creatures subject to command; this is in the true words of the ancients who _have_ passed _away_; this, too, is as a suitable servant for the righteous, these good doers; this, too, is to obtain a permanence (patîstân) of requisites; this, too, is suitable for the discreet _and is_ merciful; this, too, is as another way _in_ which the promoters of good (vêh-yâ<i>v</i>kârân) are pardoned, as soon as the Hôm-juice (parâhôm) is digested, through not _having_ eaten from dawn till night during the pure utterance of the pure glorification. 28. And, moreover, _one_ performs no work [^51], nor is even a word uttered; _one_ does not go to sleep, nor should they allow any pollution to the body; the sequence (patîsârîh) of the religious formulas is, likewise, not changed from that ordered, nor is even a detached thought away from that truth _and_ purity; _but_ always _with_ phrases rightly consecutive _and_ properly worded (hû-sakhunagânŏihâ) the Avesta is uttered; and even the manner of response of one's co-operators is _in_ modes contributing to good (hû-pa<i>d</i>âyâkŏ), or they utter the scripture (nask).

29\. Since the production of stench is needing _something_ essentially purifying, many formulas in the ceremonial are tokens _and_ signs which, while they <span id="p170"><sup><small>[ p. 170 ]</small></sup></span> are strongly manifested, are terrifying _and_ vexing to the demons, _and_ inviting _and_ rejoicing to the angels. 30. Such as, indeed, the pure Hôm, which is squeezed out by four applications of holy-water (zôrîh) [^52] with religious formulas, is noted even _as_ a similitude _of_ the understanding [^53] and birth of the four apostles bringing the good religion, who are _he who_ was the blessed Zaratû<i>s</i>t _and they who_ are _to be_ Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, and Sôshâns [^54]. 31. As also the metal mortar (hâvan) which is struck [^55] during the squeezing of the Hôm, and its sound is evoked along with the words of the Avesta, which becomes a reminder of the thoughts, words, and deeds on the coming of those true apostles into the world. 32. As _also_ the proper rite as regards the water, that they should perform three times [^56], which is showing the world the glorious seizing of water [^57] and formation <span id="p171"><sup><small>[ p. 171 ]</small></sup></span> of rain, _and_ the healthfulness of the production of rain [^58]. 33. _And_ as the purification of the milk, by the glorious ritualistic _product_ (nîrang) [^59] taken from the purifying cattle, is divided in two, by means of which the token is that which is great, glorious, _and_ good; one _being_ for the daughter _of_ Pâûrvâ<i>g</i>îryâ [^60] the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper, _and_ from her _was_ Aôshnôr full of wisdom; and one _being_ Farhank, _daughter_ of Vidhirisâ [^61], and from her came Kaî-Kavâ<i>d</i> [^62].

34\. And, as to the high-priests of the glorious religion, it is said many concomitants (pa<i>d</i>vandîhâ) are obtained; such as, much discrimination of scripture (nask), the holy-water which is indispensable as a remedy, the healthfulness which is given in that ceremonial to the sacred fire [^63] which the world destroys, that pre-eminent-strength which is given at the end of the world from the ox Hadhayã<i>s</i> [^64] unto the good _people_ scattered about (fravaftân)—it is <span id="p172"><sup><small>[ p. 172 ]</small></sup></span> mingled with the fire of men's bodies [^65], and they, therefore, become perfect and immortal through it—and there are also other _things_. 35. There are _also_ in the ceremonial many tokens _and_ signs of spiritual mysteries, glorious matters, and habitual practices of which statements _would_ be very tedious.

36\. And if the wish (ayûpŏ) should be this, that they should be _engaged_ in a single ceremony of the length of a day, a man who is righteous in purification, inside and outside the body, should stay away from all _his_ relations and the worldly transaction of business, _from_ malicious actions _and_ covetous practices, separated from all lying _and_ falsehood of relatives; _and his_ words are to be all those which are serving the angels, glorifying, _and_ begging favours. 37. Then, indeed, the way of the spirit and the harmoniousness [^66] of the sacred beings are manifest therefrom; _and_ those which are as much the means due to the primitive good creations as is more purely possible are strengthening as regards the utility (bûn) for offering, encouraging for purity, confounding for the confusers (gûmê<i>g</i>akân), terrifying for the fiends, and propitiating for the sacred beings.

38\. The ceremonial which is good is when they shall perform _it_ for a pure disposition and assured wisdom, a minder of the religion of the sacred beings of the spheres, and _with_ pure thoughts, just thoughts [^67], wise deeds, a purified body, a tongue worthy of good <span id="p173"><sup><small>[ p. 173 ]</small></sup></span> (vêh-sa<i>z</i>âk), a scripture (nask) _made_ easy [^68], a true text (a<i>v</i>istâk), ablutions performed, proper rites, undivided, and faultless. 39. Near which fashion, with like abilities, _and_ innumerable times, it is very purely solemnized in the abode of the ever-growing fire, then in the abode of the other sacred fires [^69], then in the abodes of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers _and_ other good _people, and_ then _in_ other places pronounced clean. 40. That of the three _days_ [^70] is in the abode of the fire-place which is nearest to that of the departed; the ceremony of the guardian spirits of the righteous [^71] is solemnized in purity there where the dwelling is which is nearest that of the departed whose soul is honoured. 41. And that for victories in war is then at its times of battle, the husbandry of Sâm [^72] and other offenders (vinâsagân) who _were_ for keeping away husbandry, the household attendant's place for a warrior of another rank, the occasion of the outcry of those not possessing (adârigân) a lodging, unto the rest of the same temperament (mûnôkŏ), expressly to produce _and_ maintain a proportional resemblance [^73].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (159:2) The archangels are usually reckoned as seven in number, because Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, their creator, is considered as presiding over the six others, whose names are Vohûman, Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t, Shatvaîrô, Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>. Ho<i>r</i>vada<i>d</i>, and Ame<i>r</i>ôda<i>d</i>. These names are merely corruptions of Avesta phrases meaning ‘good thought, perfect rectitude, desirable dominion, bountiful devotion, health, and immortality,’ respectively, and the archangels, or ‘immortal benefactors,’ are personifications of these ideas. They are said to have been the first creatures created, after the guardian spirits or prototypes of creation, the light, and the sky (see Bd. I, 8, 23-26).

[^2]: (159:3) See Chap. II, 5.

[^3]: (159:4) Or gâs may mean ‘time.’

[^4]: (160:1) Referring probably to the cup of Hôm juice, the preparation, consecration, and use of which are essentially characteristic of the Ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n or sacred ceremony, and are, therefore, supposed to be very repulsive to the demons.

[^5]: (161:1) That is, the purpose of the ceremonial is to afford an outward symbol of the spiritual mysteries of the religion.

[^6]: (161:2) This reading is uncertain, but the reference appears to be to the exposure of the dead. M14 has the sentence altered as follows:--‘just as the ceremony of a season-festival is exhibited more royally (or more joyously) before the season-festival, and a man who is a judge is for the purpose of making the body clean from the corrupting pollution, and also from contamination which is even outside the body, as much as is proper.’

[^7]: (161:3) That is, the pollution due to the Nasû<i>s</i>, or fiend of corruption, who is supposed to seize upon all corpses (see Chap. XVII, 7).

[^8]: (162:1) Referring to ceremonial purification by washing with bull's urine.

[^9]: (162:2) Or the clothing of the body.'

[^10]: (162:3) The sacred shirt (see Chaps. XXXIX, 19, XL, 2).

[^11]: (162:4) Reading va zôrîh, but it may be nizôrîh, ‘weakening.’

[^12]: (162:5) This seems to be the meaning of min pâ<i>d</i>afrâhîh-î dinôîkîh. At the time this was written the religion was often persecuted, and its ceremonies were liable to interruption; but even when such a misfortune was apprehended, they were not to be hurried over.

[^13]: (162:6) The word is kamîh in the MSS., but it may possibly have been kâmîh originally, in which case the meaning would be: ‘_or_ even owing to wishing for evacuation.’

[^14]: (162:7) The fire temple, where the sacred fire is kept perpetually burning.

[^15]: (163:1) The demons. In M14 the sentence, already obscure, is altered so as to be unintelligible.

[^16]: (163:2) The angels. The meaning is that, by the utterance of the proper formulas at the proper times, the demons are discouraged, and the angels are induced to come to the ceremony.

[^17]: (163:3) Perhaps we should read sâkhtârân, ‘preparers,’ as in M14, or else ya<i>s</i>târân, ‘solemnizers,’ instead of dâ<i>s</i>târân, ‘holders.’

[^18]: (163:4) This is the name of the consecrated space within which the ceremony is performed. It is often written Arvîs, but is probably to be traced to the Av. urvaêsa, ‘goal.’

[^19]: (163:5) That is, when the place is about to be used for a ceremony.

[^20]: (163:6) Literally ‘material;’ meaning the metallic and vegetable portions of the ceremonial apparatus.

[^21]: (163:7) The slightly raised platform or table upon which all the apparatus, except the fire and unconsecrated water, is placed.

[^22]: (163:8) In which the twigs of Hôm are pounded and mixed with water.

[^23]: (163:9) For the Baresôm or sacred twigs (see Chap. XLIII, 5).

[^24]: (164:1) A small stone platform on which the fire vase is placed, now usually called âdôst.

[^25]: (164:2) Reading nîrangîkîhâ dâ<i>d</i> instead of the unintelligible nîrang ashâyâ<i>d</i> of K35, which is very similarly written in Pahlavi; M14 has ‘which one is to keep pure by the ritual of words of revelation.’

[^26]: (164:3) A plant said to grow among the mountains in southern Persia, which has not yet been botanically identified, but Anquetil Duperron was told that it resembled a vine without fruit. Twigs of this plant are brought to India ‘by traders and are, therefore, considered impure until they have been purified, laid aside for a year, and again purified’ (see Haug's Essays, p. 399). A few fragments of these twigs are pounded and mixed with water in the Hôm-mortar, and the juice is tasted by the priest who performs the ceremony. The Avesta Hôm and the Sanskrit Soma must have been originally the same plant, but both Parsis and Hindus now use plants which are no doubt mere substitutes for that original. In southern and western India the Soma plant now used by the Brahmans is the _Sarcostemma Brevistigma_, a leafless bush of green succulent branches, growing upwards, with flowers like those of an onion; when not in flower it can hardly be distinguished from the _Euphorbia Tirucalli_, or thornless milk-bush, commonly used for hedges in many parts of India.

[^27]: (164:4) Reading dâm-hômand; or it may be <i>s</i>em-hômand, ‘renowned.’

[^28]: (164:5) Zaratû<i>s</i>t is said to have been begotten in consequence of his parents drinking Hôm-juice and cow's milk infused, respectively, with his guardian spirit and glory (see Zs. XI, 10 n). K35 has hôman, and M14 has hômand, instead of hôm, in this clause.

[^29]: (164:6) Av. gaokerena, sometimes called gôkar<i>d</i> in Pahlavi, the p. 165 mythic white Hôm-tree which is said to grow in the wide-formed ocean, and from which the draught of immortality is prepared for mankind at the resurrection (see Vend. XX, 17, Bd. XVIII, 1-4, XXVII, 4, XXX, 25).

[^30]: (165:1) Reading ayêngîh nisîm, but this is uncertain.

[^31]: (165:2) Av. hadhânaêpata, to represent which the Parsis now use a twig of the pomegranate bush, but it must originally have been some sweet-scented plant (see Vend. VIII, 7). The Aûrvarâm (Av. ace. urvarãm) consists of this twig, a small fragment of which is pounded with the Hôm-twigs when preparing the Hôm-juice.

[^32]: (165:3) From this it would appear that the practice of using metal wires, instead of twigs of trees, for the baresôm (see Chap. XLIII, 5) was not in use a thousand years ago.

[^33]: (165:4) Literally ‘Shatvaîrian;’ the archangel Shatvaî<i>r</i>ô (Av. khshathra vairya, ‘desirable dominion’) having special charge of all metals (see Bd. XXX, 19, Sls. XV, 14-19).

[^34]: (165:5) Reading baresom; K35 has basom and M14 bîm-i<i>k</i>.

[^35]: (165:6) M14 substitutes yôshdâsarînî<i>d</i>ŏ for denman hîgarînî<i>d</i>ŏ, p. 166 and pa<i>d</i>mûkht for va khîm hat, so as to read ‘the outside of their own bodies is purified and attired in clean clothing,’ but this can hardly be reconciled with the context. The term hîgar or hîkhar (Av. hikhra), here translated ‘bodily refuse,’ is applied to any refuse or dirt from the living body, or any _liquid_ exudation from a dead one.

[^36]: (166:1) Reading gôvak, but it may be yûvâk, ‘wishing,’ or dûvâk, ‘flowing: M14 alters it to vênâk, ’looking,‘ which suits the eyes well enough, but hardly seems to express the author’s idea.

[^37]: (166:2) See Chap. XLI, 5.

[^38]: (166:3) M14 has ‘having purified around the place.’

[^39]: (166:4) The Âta<i>s</i> Nyâyi<i>s</i> (see Haug's Essays, p. 403).

[^40]: (166:5) This place is at the end of the ceremonial area farthest from p. 167 the fire. Here the priest first invokes the spirits in whose honour the ceremony is about to be performed, by reciting their several propitiatory formulas (see Chap. XXIX, I).

[^41]: (167:1) Referring to any other priests who may be present.

[^42]: (167:2) M14 has ‘for carriers,’ omitting the three clauses about the Avesta, fire, and bringing water.

[^43]: (167:3) Or, perhaps, ‘there is _he_ who may be a bringer;’ and similarly in the following clauses. The plural suffix -îhâ being identical in form with the Pâz. conditional form of the verb ‘to be,’ which seems to be the origin of the adverbial suffix corresponding to -ly in English when added to an adjective; occasionally it is added to a substantive, as is probably the case here, and can then be only translated by ‘may, or would, be’ (see Chap. XLIV, 11).

[^44]: (167:4) This first clause may belong to the preceding section.

[^45]: (168:1) K35 has drôn, ‘sacred cake,’ instead of drû<i>g</i>.

[^46]: (168:2) The twentieth Nask, which is said to have chiefly treated of religious ceremonies and texts (see Byt. III, 25). Two Avesta fragments, published by Westergaard as Yt. XXI and XXII, are traditionally ascribed to this Nask.

[^47]: (168:3) Another name for the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> Nask, from which the Bundahi<i>s</i> appears to have originated (see Zs. IX, 1). The name is also applied to a particular series of ceremonies, continued for twelve successive days in honour of each of the twenty-two sacred beings whose names are given to the 1st-7th, 9th-14th, 16th-22nd, 24th, and 26th days of the month; these ceremonies last, therefore, for 264 days (see Byt. II, 59).

[^48]: (168:4) It can hardly be akadbâ, as that would imply that it ‘is not recited by any undeceitful voice.’ The use of the prefix â- in the sense of ‘with’ is rare, but it occurs in âpastanû, ‘pregnant,’ (whence Pers. âbistan), and is noticed by Dastûr Jâmâspji in his Pahlavi Dictionary, p. 2.

[^49]: (168:5) Reading bun-î ko<i>l</i>â râstîh, apparently a forerunner of the modern name Bundahi<i>s</i>.

[^50]: (168:6) The frâyar period of the day corresponds to the Hâvan Gâh or morning (compare Farh. Okh. p. 42 with Bd. XXV, 9), at which time the Yasna ceremonial should be performed when not accompanied p. 169 by the Vendidâ<i>d</i>; or, according to the text, it must be performed by daylight.

[^51]: (169:1) During the ceremonial.

[^52]: (170:1) In preparing the Hôm juice fresh holy-water (zôr) is added four times to the Hôm-twigs which are each time pounded anew, while reciting the Ahunavar formula, and their liquor strained into a cup (see Haug's Essays, p. 402).

[^53]: (170:2) There is no authority for translating <i>s</i>invi<i>s</i>nŏ by ‘conception,’ otherwise that meaning would suit this sentence better. M14 has yehevûni<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘existence,’ which differs by only one extra stroke of the pen in Pahlavi.

[^54]: (170:3) See Chap. II, 10.

[^55]: (170:4) The word <i>s</i>ikâ<i>v</i>î-aîtŏ really means ‘is split.’ During the pounding of the Hôm-twigs the pestle is struck several times against the sides of the mortar, so as to produce a ringing sound (see Haug's Essays, p. 401).

[^56]: (170:5) Reading vidanâg, instead of gûn-aê, by transposing the first two Pahlavi characters. After the first series of poundings of the Hôm-twigs holy-water is added to them three times while reciting, each time, the Ashem-vohû formula (ibid.).

[^57]: (170:6) The evaporation from the ocean, said to be effected by Tî<i>s</i>tar for the production of rain (see Chap. XCIII, 2, 3).

[^58]: (171:1) The delightfulness of rain after an eight-months' drought cannot be adequately appreciated by a dweller in Europe.

[^59]: (171:2) That is, bull's urine.

[^60]: (171:3) The reading of this name, as well as that of Aôshnôr, is doubtful; but if these names occur at all in the extant Avesta, they may perhaps be found in. the Aoshnara pouru-<i>g</i>îra of Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 131, Âf. Zarat. 2; the epithet pouru-<i>g</i>îra, when it occurs after the name, would naturally be considered a patronymic, whence a father or grandfather could be easily created, if he did not exist already in legendary history.

[^61]: (171:4) This name is written in Pâzand, and is evidently meant for the same person as the Pâz. Vîdharg-âfrâ<i>s</i>taka of Bd. XXXI, 31.

[^62]: (171:5) M14 has ‘from him she came unto Kaî-Kavâ<i>d</i>,’ which would tally better with the statements in Bd. XXXI, 25, 31.

[^63]: (171:6) Literally ‘the fire of Varahrân (Bahrâm).’

[^64]: (171:7) See Chap. XXXVII, 99.

[^65]: (172:1) The vital heat or Vohu-fryãn fire (see Bd. XVII, 1, 2).

[^66]: (172:2) Reading âhankânakîh, as in K35; M14 has khadûkânakîh, ‘unity,’ which is a much commoner word, nearly identical with the other in its Pahlavi form.

[^67]: (172:3) So in the MSS., but it was probably ‘true words’ originally, so as to complete the triad of thought, word, and deed.

[^68]: (173:1) That is, learnt by heart.

[^69]: (173:2) Literally ‘fires of Varahrân.’

[^70]: (173:3) The three days after a death, during which ceremonies are performed in honour of the angel Srôsh, who is supposed to protect the departed soul from the demons during that period, while it is still hovering about the body (see Chap. XXVIII, 6).

[^71]: (173:4) On the fourth day after a death (see Chap. XXVIII, 7).

[^72]: (173:5) That is, Keresâsp the Sâman (see Chap. XVII, 6); having been a famous warrior, his husbandry is said to be battle, the destruction of all ordinary husbandry.

[^73]: (173:6) That is, the ruin of people by war leads them to demand a share of the property of those more fortunate, so as to produce an equality. The whole section seems to be a bitter sarcasm upon the effects of war, representing the generals as cultivators of p. 174 slaughter and rapine, with the soldiers as their domestic servants, driving the people into social democracy.
