## APPENDIX. III. THE MEANING OF KHVÊTÛK-DAS OR KHVÊTÛDÂ<i>D</i>.

THAT the term Khvêtûk-das is applied to marriages between kinsfolk is admitted by the Parsis, but they consider that such marriages were never contracted by their ancestors within the first degree of relationship, because they are not so permitted among themselves at the present day. Any statements of Greek, or other foreign, writers, regarding the marriage of Persians with their mothers, sisters, or daughters, they believe to be simply calumnies due to ignorance, which it is discreditable to Europeans to quote  [^1]. Such statements, they consider, may have referred to the practices of certain heretical sects, but never to those of the orthodox faith.

The Parsis are, no doubt, fully justified in receiving the statements of foreign writers, regarding the customs of their ancestors, with proper caution; a caution which is quite as necessary when the statements are agreeable as when they are disagreeable to present notions. The Greeks, especially, had such a thorough contempt for all foreign customs that differed from their own, that they must have found it quite as difficult to obtain correct information, or to form an impartial opinion, about oriental habits as the average European finds it at the present time. On the other hand, the Parsis have to consider that the ancient Greek writers, whose statements they repudiate, were neither priests nor zealots, whose accounts of religious customs <span id="p390"><sup><small>[ p. 390 ]</small></sup></span> might be distorted by religious prejudices, but historians accustomed to describe facts as impartially as their information and nationality would permit. It is quite possible that these writers may have assumed that such marriages were common among the Persians, merely because they had sometimes occurred among the Persian rulers; but such an assumption would be as erroneous as supposing that the marriage practices of the Israelites were similar to those of their most famous kings, David and Solomon, forgetting that an oriental sovereign is usually considered to be above the law and not subject to it.

Rejecting all statements of foreigners, as liable to suspicion, unless confirmed by better evidence, it seems desirable to ascertain what information can be obtained, on this subject, from the religious books of the Parsis themselves. This matter has hitherto been too much neglected by those best acquainted with the original texts, and must be considered as only partially exhausted in the following pages.

The term Khvêtûk-das [^2] is a Pahlavi transcription of the Avesta word <i>h</i><i>v</i>aêtvadatha, ‘a giving of, to, or by, one’s own,‘ and is sometimes partially translated into the form Khvêtûk-das, or Khvêtûk-da<i>d</i>, in which the syllable dâ<i>d</i>, ’what is given, a gift,' is merely a translation of the syllable das (Av. datha).

The Avesta word <i>h</i><i>v</i>aêtvadatha is not found in any of the Gâthas, or sacred hymns, that are still extant and are usually considered the oldest portion <span id="p391"><sup><small>[ p. 391 ]</small></sup></span> of the Avesta. But its former component, <i>h</i><i>v</i>aêtu, occurs several times therein, with the meaning ‘one’s own, or kinsman,‘ as distinguished from ’friends‘ and ’slaves.'

The earliest occurrence of the complete word is probably in Yas. XIII, 28 [^3], where it is mentioned as follows:--‘I praise . . . . the righteous <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtvadatha, which is the greatest and best and most excellent of things that exist and will exist, which is Ahurian and Zarathu<i>s</i>trian.’ This merely implies that <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtvadatha was a good work of much importance, which is also shown by Visp. III, 18, Gâh IV, 8, and Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Yt. 17, where the <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtvadatha (meaning the man who has accomplished that good work) is associated with youths who are specially righteous for other reasons. But there is nothing in any of these passages to indicate the nature of the good work.

In Vend. VIII, 35, 36 we are told that those who carry the dead must afterwards wash their hair and bodies with the urine ‘of cattle or draught oxen, not of men or women, except the two who are <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtvadatha and <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtvadathi,’ that is, male and female performers of <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtvadatha. This passage, therefore, proves that the good work might be accomplished by both men and women, but it does not absolutely imply that it had any connection with marriage.

Turning to the Pahlavi translations of these passages we find the transcription Khvêtûk-das, Khvêtûk-dat, or Khvêtûk-dasîh, with explanations which add very little to our knowledge of the nature of <span id="p392"><sup><small>[ p. 392 ]</small></sup></span> the good work. Thus, Pahl. Yas. XI II, 28 merely states that it is ‘declared about it that it is requisite to do _it_;’ Pahl. Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Yt. 17 [^4] asserts that ‘the duty of Khvêtûk-das is said _to be_ the greatest good work in the religion, that, owing to it, Aharman, the demon of demons, is becoming hopeless, so that the dissolution of Khvêtûk-das is worthy of death;’ and Pahl. Vend. VIII, 36 speaks of ‘the two who are a Khvêtûk-dat man _and_ woman [^5], that is, it is done by them.’

Another reference to Khvêtûk-das in the Pahlavi translations of the Avesta occurs in Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 4, as follows:--'Thus I proclaim in the world that \[which he who is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> made his own\] best \[Khvêtûk-das\] [^6]. By aid of righteousness Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is aware, who created this _one_ [^7] \[to perform <span id="p393"><sup><small>[ p. 393 ]</small></sup></span> Khvêtûk-das\]. And through fatherhood Vohûman [^8] _was_ cultivated by him, \[that is, for the sake of the proper nurture of the creatures Khvêtûk-das _was_ performed by him.\] So she who is _his_ daughter is acting well, \[who is the fully-mindful\] Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^9], \[that is, she did not shrink from the act of Khvêtûk-das.\] _She_ [^10] _was_ not deceived, \[that is, _she_ did not shrink from the act of Khvêtûk-das, because _she_ is\] an observer of everything \[as regards that which is\] Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>‘s, \[that is, through the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _she_ attains to all duty and law.\]’ The allusions to Khvêtûk-das in this passage are mere interpolations introduced by the Pahlavi translators, for the sake of recommending the practice; they have no existence in the Avesta text, but they show that the Pahlavi translators understood Khvêtûk-das to <span id="p394"><sup><small>[ p. 394 ]</small></sup></span> refer to such relationship as that of father and daughter, as will appear more clearly from further allusions to the same circumstances in passages to be quoted hereafter [^11]. Regarding the age of the Pahlavi translation of the Yasna we only know for certain that it existed in its present form a thousand years ago, because a passage is quoted from it by Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, brother of the author of the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk and Epistles of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, in his Selections [^12], and we know that he was living in A.D. 881 [^13]. But it was probably revised for the last time as early as the reign of Khûsrô Nôshirvân (A.D. 531-579), when the Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i> was also finally revised [^14].

The Pahlavi versions of the lost Nasks must have been nearly of the same age as those of the extant Avesta, but of the contents of these versions we possess only certain statements of later writers. According to some of the modern Persian statements the Dûbâsrû<i>g</i>e<i>d</i> Nask contained many details about Khvêtûk-das, but this is contradicted by the long account of its contents given in the eighth book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, which was written more than a thousand years ago [^15], and in which Khvêtûk-das is not once noticed. The practice is, however, mentioned several times in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, as an important good work noticed in the Nasks, but no details are given, except in the following passages from the ninth book:--

First, regarding the latter part of the eighteenth fargar<i>d</i> of the Vara<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask:--‘And this, too, <span id="p395"><sup><small>[ p. 395 ]</small></sup></span> that thereupon they shall excite a brother _and_ sister with mutual desire, so that they shall perform Khvêtûk-das with unanimity, and before midday are generated a radiance which is sublime, centred in the face, and peeping glances (vênîkŏ Mils); and they make the radiance, _which_ is openly manifest, grow up in altitude the height of three spears of a length of three reeds _each_ [^16]; and after midday they have learned expulsion (rânakîh [^17]), _and_ shall renounce the fiend who is before the destroyer.’ This is clearly an allusion to the Khvêtûk-das of brother and sister, as it can hardly be considered as merely referring to the arrangement of marriages between their children.

Second, regarding the earlier part of the fourteenth fargar<i>d</i> of the Bakô N ask:--‘And this, too, that the performance of whatever would be a causer of procreation for the doers of actions is extolled _as_ the perfect custom of the first Khvêtûk-das; because causing the procreation of the doers of actions is the fatherhood of mankind, the proper fatherhood of mankind is through the proper production of progeny, the proper production of progeny is the cultivation of progeny in one’s own with the inclinations (khîmîhâ) of a first wish [^18], and the cultivation of progeny in one‘s own is Khvêtûk-das. And he who extols the fatherhood of mankind, when _it is_ a causer of the procreation of the doers of actions, has also extolled Khvêtûk-das. And this, too, that the proper nurture for the creatures, by him whose wish is for <span id="p396"><sup><small>[ p. 396 ]</small></sup></span> virtue, has taught _him_ to perform Khvêtûk-das. Virtue is its virtue even for this reason, because, for the sake of maintaining a creature with propriety, he reckons upon the proper disposition of the multitude, that which is generated in the race by innumerable Khvêtûk-dases [^19]. And this, too, that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is taught _as being_ in daughterhood to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by him whose wisdom _consists_ in complete mindfulness. Even on this account, because wisdom _and_ complete mindfulness [^20] are within the limits of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>; wisdom is that which is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>’s, complete mindfulness is that which is Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>‘s, and complete mindfulness is the progeny of wisdom, just as Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. And from this is expressly the announcement that, by him who _has_ connected complete mindfulness with wisdom, Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is taught _as being_ in daughterhood to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. And this, too, the existence of the formation of that daughterhood, is taught by him whose righteousness _consists_ in complete mindfulness.’ This quotation merely shows that Khvêtûk-das referred to connections between near relations, but whether the subsequent allusions to the daughterhood of Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> had reference to the Khvêtûk-das of father and daughter is less certain than in the case of Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 4, previously quoted [^21].

Third, regarding the middle of the twenty-first <span id="p397"><sup><small>[ p. 397 ]</small></sup></span> fargar<i>d</i> of the Bakô Nask:--‘And this, too, that a daughter is given in marriage (nê<i>s</i>manîh) to a father, even so as a woman to another man, by him who teaches the daughter and the other woman the reverence _due_ unto father and husband.’ The reference here to the marriage of father and daughter is too clear to admit of mistake, though the term Khvêtûk-das is not mentioned.

Next in age to the Pahlavi versions of the Avesta we ought perhaps to place the Book of Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf, because we are told (AV. I, 35), regarding Vîrâf, that ‘there are _some_ who call _him by_ the name of Nikhshahpûr,’ and this may have been the celebrated commentator of that name, who was a councillor of king Khûsrô Nôshirvân [^22], so that we cannot safely assume that this book was written earlier than the end of the sixth century. It gives an account of heaven and hell, which Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf is supposed to have visited during the period of a week, while he seemed to be in a trance. In the second grade of heaven, counting upwards, he found the souls of those who had ‘performed no ceremonies, chanted no sacred hymns, and practised no Khvêtûk-das,’ but had come there ‘through other good works;’ and it may be noted that the two upper grades of heaven appear to have been reserved for good sovereigns, chieftains, high-priests, and others specially famous. In hell, also, he saw the soul of a woman suffering grievous punishment because she had ‘violated Khvêtûk-das;’ but this passage occurs in one MS. only. We are also told (AV. II, 1-3, 7-10) that ‘Vîrâf had seven sisters, and all [^23] those seven sisters <span id="p398"><sup><small>[ p. 398 ]</small></sup></span> were as wives of Vîrâf; revelation, also, _was_ easy to them, and the ritual had _been_ performed . . . . they stood up and bowed, and spoke thus: "Do not this thing, ye Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers! for we are seven sisters, and he is an only brother, and we are, all seven sisters, as wives [^24] of that brother."’ This passage, supposing that it really refers to marriage, seems to attribute an exaggerated form of the Khvêtûk-das of brother and sister to Vîrâf, as a proof of his extraordinary sanctity; but it can hardly be considered as a literal statement of facts, any more than the supposed case of a woman having married seven brothers successively, mentioned in Mark xii. 20-22. Luke xx. 29-32.

In another Pahlavi book of about the same age, which is best known by its Pâzand name, Mainyô-i Khar<i>d</i> [^25], we find Khvêtûk-das placed second among <span id="p399"><sup><small>[ p. 399 ]</small></sup></span> seven classes of good works (Mkh. IV, 4), and ninth among thirty-three classes of the same (Mkh. XXXVII, 12); and the dissolution of Khvêtûk-das is mentioned as the fourth in point of heinousness among thirty classes of sin (Mkh. XXXVI, 7).

In the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t, which may have existed in its original Pahlavi form before the Muhammadan conquest of Persia [^26], it is stated that, even in the perplexing time of foreign conquest, the righteous man ‘continues the religious practice of Khvêtûk-das in his family [^27].’

The third book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, which appears to have been compiled by the last editor [^28] of that work, contains a long defence of the practice of Khvêtûk-das, forming its eighty-second [^29] chapter, which may be translated as follows:--

'On a grave attack (hû-girâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) of a Jew upon <span id="p400"><sup><small>[ p. 400 ]</small></sup></span> a priest, which _was_ owing to asking the reason of the custom (âhankŏ) as to Khvêtûk-das; and the reply of the priest to him from the exposition of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion.

‘That is, as _one_ complaining about wounds, damage, _and_ distress comes on, _it_ is lawful to dispute with him in defence begirt with legal opinion (dâ<i>d</i>istânŏ parvand), and the consummation of the accusation of an innocent man is averted; _so_ of the creatures, the invisible connection of their own power to fellow-creations _and_ their own _race_, through the propitiousness of the protection _and_ preserving _influence_ of the sacred beings, is a girdle, _and_ the consummation of the mutual assistance of men is Khvêtûk-das. The name is Khvêtûk-das, which is _used_ when _it is_ “a giving of _one’s_ own” (khvê<i>s</i>\-dahi<i>s</i>nîh), and its office (gâs) is a strong connection with one‘s own _race and_ fellow-creations, through the protection _and_ preserving _influence_ of the sacred beings, which is, according to the treatises, the union of males _and_ females of mankind of one’s own _race_ in preparation for, and connection with, the renovation _of the universe_. That union, for the sake of proceeding incalculably more correctly, is, among the innumerable similar races of mankind, that with near kinsfolk (nabânazdi<i>s</i>tânŏ), _and_, among near kinsfolk, that with those next of kin (nazd-pa<i>d</i>vandânŏ); _and_ the mutual connection of the three kinds of nearest of kin (nazd-pa<i>d</i>vandtar)—which are father and daughter, so and she who bore _him_ [^30], and brother and sister—is the most complete (a<i>v</i>îrtar) that I have considered.

<span id="p401"><sup><small>[ p. 401 ]</small></sup></span>

‘On the same subject the exposition of the obscure statements of the good religion, by a wise high-priest of the religion, is this:--“I assert that God (yêdatŏ) is the being, as regards the creatures, who created _any_ of the creatures there are which are male, and _any_ there are which are female; and that which is male is a son, and, similarly, a daughter is that which is female. The daughter of himself, the father of all, _was_ Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^31], the earth, a female being of the creation; and from her he created the male Gâyômar<i>d</i> [^32], which is explained _as_ the name for him who _was_ specially the first man, since it is Gâyômar<i>d</i> living who is speaking _and_ mortal, a limitation which _was_ specially his, because of these three words—which are ’living, speaking, _and_ mortal‘—two of the limitations, which are ’living and speaking,‘ _were_ through the provision of _his_ father, the creator, and one, which is ’mortal,‘ _was_ proceeding from the destroyer; the same limitation is upon all mankind, who are connected with that man’s lineage, until the renovation _of the universe_. And now I say, if the aid of the father _has_ produced a male from the daughter, it is named a Khvêtûk-das of father _and_ daughter [^33].”

'This, too, is from the exposition of the religion, that the semen of Gâyômar<i>d</i>\—which is called seed—when he passed away, fell _to_ Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^34], the earth, which _was_ his own mother; and, from its being united <span id="p402"><sup><small>[ p. 402 ]</small></sup></span> _there_ with, Mashya _and_ Mashîyôî [^35] _were_ the son and daughter of Gâyômar<i>d</i> and Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, _and_ it is named the Khvêtûk-das of son and mother. And Mashya and Mashîyôî, as male and female, practised the quest of offspring, one with the other, and it is named the Khvêtûk-das of brother and sister. And many couples _were_ begotten by them, _and_ the couples became continually [^36] wife and husband [^37]; and all men, who _have_ been, are, and _will_ be, are from origin the seed of Khvêtûk-das. And this is the reason which is essential for _its_ fulfilment by law, _that_ where _its_ contemplation (andâ<i>g</i>isnŏ) exists _it_ is manifest from the increase of the people of all regions,

'And I assert that the demons are enemies of man, and a non-existence of desire for them consists _in_ striving for it when Khvêtûk-das is practised; it then becomes their [^38] reminder _of_ that original practice of contemplation which is the complete gratitude of men, and _has_ become his [^39] who is inimical to them. Grievous fear, distress, and anguish also come upon them, _their_ power diminishes, and they less understand the purpose of causing the disturbance _and_ ruin of men. And _it_ is certain that making the demons distressed, suffering, frightened, _and_ weakened is thus a good work, and this way of having reward and _of_ recompense is the property of the practisers of such good works.

‘And I assert that the goodness of appearance and growth of body, the display of wisdom, temper, <span id="p403"><sup><small>[ p. 403 ]</small></sup></span> and modesty, the excellence of skill _and_ strength, and also the other qualities of children are so much _the more_ as they are nearer to the original race of the begetter, and they shall receive _them_ more perfectly _and_ more gladly. An example is seen _in_ those who _spring_ from a religious _woman_ who is gentle, believing the spiritual _existence_, acting modestly, of scanty strength, who is a forgiver and reverential, _and from_ a mail-_clad_ (gapar) warrior of worldly religion, who is large-bodied _and_ possessing strength which is stimulating (âgâr) _his_ stout heart while he begets. They [^40] are not completely for war—which is a continuance of lamentation (nâ<i>s</i>\-ravandîh)—and not for carefulness and affection for the soul; as _from_ the dog _and_ wolf—and not the ruin (se<i>g</i>) _of_ the sheep—arises the fox, like the wolf, _but_ not _with_ the strength of the wolf like the dog, and it does not even possess _its_ perfect shape, nor that of the dog. And _they are_ like those which are born from a swift Arab horse and a native _dam_, and are not galloping like the Arab, and not kicking (pa<i>d</i>âyak) like the native. And _they have_ not even the same perfect characteristics  [^41], just as the mule that _springs_ from, the horse and the ass, which is not like unto either’ of them, and even _its_ seed is cut off thereby, _and its_ lineage is not propagated forwards.

'And this is the advantage from the pure preservation of race. I assert that _there_ are three [^42] species <span id="p404"><sup><small>[ p. 404 ]</small></sup></span> (vâg) _and_ kinds of affection of sister _and_ brother for that which shall be born of them:—one is this, where _it is_ the offspring of brother and brother; one is this, where the offspring is that of [^43] brothers [^44] and their sister; and one is this, where _it is_ the offspring of sisters [^45]. And as to the one of these where the offspring is that of [^46] a brother, and for the same reason as applies to all three [^47] species of them, the love, desire, and effort, which arise for the nurture of offspring of the three species, are in hope of benefit. And equally adapted are the offspring to the procreators; and this is the way of the increasing love of children, through the good nurture which is very hopeful.

'And so, also, are those who are born of father and daughter, or son and mother. Light flashed forth (<i>g</i>astŏ) or unflashed (aparvâkhtŏ) is always seen at the time when it is much exposed, and pleased is he who has a child of his child, even when it is from some one of a different race and different <span id="p405"><sup><small>[ p. 405 ]</small></sup></span> country. That, too, _has_ then become much delight (vâyag) _which_ is expedient, that pleasure, sweet ness, and joy which are owing to a son that a man begets from a daughter of his own, who is also a brother _of that_ same mother; and he who is born of a son and mother is also a brother _of that_ same father; this is a way of much pleasure, which is a blessing of the joy, _and_ no harm is therein ordained that is more than the advantage, and no vice that is more than the well-doing (khûp gâr). And if it be said that it is of evil appearance, it should be observed that when [^48] a wound occurs in the sexual part of a mother, or sister, or daughter, and she flees (fravê<i>d</i>) from a medical man, and there is no opportunity for him to apply a seton (palîtŏ), and her father, or son, or brother is instructed in similar surgery, which is more evil _in_ appearance, when they touch the part with the hand, and apply a seton, or _when_ a strange man _does so?_

'And, when _it_ is desirable to effect their union, which is the less remarkable (kam hû-zanâkhîktar) in evil appearance, when they are united (hamdvâ<i>d</i>î-hênd) by them in secret, such as when the hearing of their written _contract_ (nipi<i>s</i>tŏ) of wifehood and husbandhood [^49] is accomplished in the back_ground_ (dar pû<i>s</i>tŏ), or when the sound of drums and trumpets acquaints the whole district, where <span id="p406"><sup><small>[ p. 406 ]</small></sup></span> these people are renowned, that such an Arûman [^50] intends to effect such a purpose with the daughter, sister, or mother of such a Pârsî man?

'On this account of less evil appearance is even the good appearance which is to be mutually practised; and after the mode is seen, even the advantageousness in the accomplishment of the daily duty of concealing disgrace, the mutual desire, the mutual advantage and harm, and the contentment _which arise_ as to whatever has happened are also mutual assistance. Some, with a husband and faint-heartedness, _have_ a disposition (<i>s</i>ânŏ) of incapability, and the diligence which is in their reverence of the husband, who is ruler of the family (bûnag shah), is _due_ even _to_ the supremacy which he would set over them through the severity of a husband. Very many others, too, who are strange women, are not content with a custom (va<i>g</i>) of this description; for they demand even ornaments to cover _and_ clothe the bold _and_ active _ones_, and slaves, dyes, perfumes, extensive preparations, and many other things of house-mistresses which are according to their desire, though _it_ is not possible they should receive _them_. And, if _it_ be not possible, they would not accept retrenchment; and, if they should not accept retrenchment, it hurries _on_ brawling, abuse, and ugly words about this, and even uninterrupted falsehood (avisistak-i<i>k</i> zûr) is diffused as regards it; of the secrets, moreover, _which_ they conceal they preserve night and day a bad representation, and unobservantly. They shall take the bad _wife_ to <span id="p407"><sup><small>[ p. 407 ]</small></sup></span> the house of _her_ father and mother, the husband is dragged to the judges, _and_ they shall form a district assembly (shat<i>r</i>ô angê<i>z</i>ŏ) about it. And lest he _should_ speak thus: “I will release _her_ from wifehood _with_ me [^51],” vice and fraud of many kinds _and_ the misery of deformity are the faults which are also secretly attributed to him.

'A wife of those three classes [^52] is to be provided, since they would not do even one of _these_ things [^53]; on which account, even through advantageousness, virtuous living, precious abundance, dignity, and innocence, mutual labour is manifestly mighty _and_ strong.

‘And if it be said that, “with all this which you explain, there is also, afterwards, a depravity (darvakh) which is hideous,” it should be understood in the mind that hideousness and beauteousness are specially those _things_ which _do_ not _exist_ in themselves, but through some one’s habit of taking _up_ an opinion and belief. The hideous children of many are in the ideas of procreation exceedingly handsome, and the handsome forms of many are in the ideas of a housekeeper (khânŏpânŏ) exceedingly ugly. We consider him also as _one_ of our enemies when any one walks naked in the country, _which_ you consider hideous; _but_ the naked skins of <span id="p408"><sup><small>[ p. 408 ]</small></sup></span> the country call _him_ handsome whose garments, which seem to them hideous, have fallen _off_. And we are _they_ in whose ideas a nose level with the face is ugly, _but they_ who account a prominent nose ugly, and say it is a walling _that_ reaches between the two eyes, remain selecting a handsome _one_ [^54]. And concerning handsomeness and ugliness in themselves, which are only through _having_ taken _up_ an opinion and belief, _there_ is a change even through time and place; for _any_ one of the ancients whose head _was_ shaved was _as it were_ ugly, and it was so settled by law that _it was_ a sin worthy of death for them [^55]; then its habits (<i>s</i>ânŏ) did not direct the customs of the country to shave the head of a man, _but_ now there is a sage who has considered _it_ as handsome _and_ even a good work. Whoever is not clear that _it_ is hideous is to think, about something threatening (girâî), that _it_ is even so not in itself, but through _what is_ taken into themselves they consider that _it_ is hideous.

'Then for us the good work of that thing [^56], _of_ which _it_ is cognizable that it is so ordained by the creator, has _its_ recompense; it is the protector of the race, _and_ the family is more perfect; _its_ nature <span id="p409"><sup><small>[ p. 409 ]</small></sup></span> is without vexation (apî<i>z</i>âr) and gathering affection, an advantage to the child—the lineage _being_ exalted—gathering (a<i>v</i>ar<i>k</i>ûn) hope, offspring, and pleasure _it_ is sweetness _to_ the procreator, and the joy is most complete; less is the harm _and_ more the advantage, little the pretence and much the skill of the graceful blandishments (nâz<i>â</i>nŏ) which are apparent, aiding and procuring assistance (ban<i>g</i>isnŏ), averting disaster, and conducting affairs; less is the fear, through itself is itself illustrious, and the steadfast shall abandon crime (<i>k</i>am). And all our fathers and grandfathers, by whom the same practice _was_ lawfully cherished, maintained _it_ handsomely in _their_ homes; and to think of mankind only as regards some assistance is the enlightenment of the steadfast, a reason which is exhibiting the evidence of wisdom, that no practice of it [^57] is not expedient.

‘And if it be said that the law [^58] _has_ afterwards commanded as regards that _custom_ thus: “Ye shall not practise _it!_” every one who is cognizant of that command is to consider _it_ current; _but_ we are not cognizant of that command, and _by_ an intelligent _person_ (khapârvârakŏ) this should also be seen minutely, through correct observation, that all the knowledge of men has arisen from Khvêtûk-das. For knowledge is generated by the union of instinctive wisdom and acquired wisdom [^59]; instinctive wisdom is the female, _and_ acquired wisdom the male; and on this account, since both are an achievement by the creator, they are sister and brother. And <span id="p410"><sup><small>[ p. 410 ]</small></sup></span> also of everything worldly the existence, maturing, _and_ arrangement are due to union in proportion; water, which is female, and fire, which is male [^60], are accounted sister _and_ brother in combination, and they seem as _though one_ restrains _them_ from Khvêtûk-das, unless, through being dissipated themselves [^61], seed—which is progeny—arises therefrom; _and_ owing to a mutual proportionableness of water and fire is the power in the brain, for if the water be more it rots _it_ away, _and_ if the fire be more it burns _it_ away.’

This elaborate defence of Khvêtûk-das shows clearly that, at the time it was written (about a thousand years ago), that custom was understood to include actual marriages between the nearest relatives, although those between first cousins appear to be also referred to.

In the 195th [^62] chapter of the third book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> we are told that the eighth of the ten admonitions, delivered to mankind by Zaratû<i>s</i>t, was this:--‘For the sake of much terrifying of the demons, and much lodgment of the blessing of the holy [^63] in one’s body, Khvêtûk-das is to be practised.'

And the following chapter informs us, that ‘opposed to that admonition of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t, of practising Khvêtûk-das for the sake of much terrifying <span id="p411"><sup><small>[ p. 411 ]</small></sup></span> of the demons from the body of man, and the lodgment of the blessing of the holy in the body, the wicked wizard Akhtŏ [^64], the enemy of the good _man_ on account of the perplexing living which _would arise_ from his practising Khvêtûk-das, preferred not practising Khvêtûk-das.’

The practice is also mentioned in the 287th chapter of the same book, in the following passage:--‘The welfare of the aggregate of one’s own limb-formations—those which _exist_ through no labour of one‘s own, _and_ have not come to the aid of those not possessing _them_ (anaf<i>s</i>manân) owing to their own want of gratitude—even _one_ of a previous formation _has_ to eulogize suitably; _and_ this which _has_ come, completely establishing (spôr-nih) the Avesta, _one_ calls equally splendid, by the most modestly comprehensive appellation _of_ Khvêtûk-das.’

In the sixth book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, which professes to be a summary of the opinions of those of the primitive faith [^65], we are told that, ‘when the good work of Khvêtûk-das shall diminish, darkness will increase and light will diminish.’

In the seventh book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, which relates the marvels of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, we are informed that it was ‘recounted how—Gâyômar<i>d</i> [^66] _having_ passed _away—it was_ declared secondly, as regards worldly _beings_, to Masyê and Masyâôê [^67], the first progeny of Gâyômar<i>d</i>, by the word of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>\—that is, he spoke to them when they <span id="p412"><sup><small>[ p. 412 ]</small></sup></span> were produced by him—thus: “You are the men I produce, you are the parents of all bodily life, and so you men shall not worship the demons, for the possession of complete mindfulness [^68] _has been_ perfectly supplied to you by me, so that you _may_ quite full-mindfully observe duty and decrees.” And the creativeness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _was_ extolled by them, and they advanced in diligence; they also performed the will of the creator, _they_ carved (parkâvînî<i>d</i>ŏ) advantage _out of_ the many duties of the world, _and_ practised Khvêtûk-das through procreation _and_ the union and complete progress of the creations in the world, which are the best good works of mankind.’

The following passage also occurs in the same book:--‘Then Zaratû<i>s</i>t, on becoming exalted, called out unto the material world of righteousness to extol righteousness and downcast are the demons; and, "homage _being_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the ceremonial and praise of the archangels are the best for you, I assert; and, _as to_ deprecation (aya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîh) of the demons, Khvêtûk-das is even the best intimation, so that, from the information which is given _as to_ the trustworthiness of a good work, the greatest is the most intimate of them, _those of_ father _and_ daughter, son _and_ she who bore _him_ [^69], and brother _and_ sister."_It is_ declared that, upon those words, innumerable demon-worshipping Kîks and Karaps [^70] disputed (sâri<i>s</i>i<i>d</i>ŏ) with Zaratû<i>s</i>t and strove for his death, just like this which revelation states:--"It is then the multitude clamoured (mar ba<i>r</i>â vîrâ<i>d</i>) who are in the vicinity of the seat of Tûr, the <span id="p413"><sup><small>[ p. 413 ]</small></sup></span> well-afflicting [^71] holder of decision; and the shame of the brother of Tûr arose, like _that of_ a man whose shame _was_ that they spoke of his Khvêtûk-das so that he might perform it. This Tûr _was_ Tûr-î Aûrvâîtâ-sang [^72], the little-giving, _who_ was like a great sovereign of that quarter; and he maintained many troops and _much_ power. And the multitude told him they would seize the great _one_ from him who is little [^73]. _But_ Tûr-î Aûrvâîtâ-sang, the little-giving _and_ well-afflicting, _spoke_ thus:--’_Should_ I thereupon smite him, this great _one_ who mingles together those propitious words for us—where we are thus without doubt _as to_ one thing therein, such as Khvêtûk-das, that it is not necessary to perform _it_\—it would make us ever doubtful that it _might_ be necessary to perform it.‘ . . . . And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke to him thus: ’I am not always that reserved speaker, by whom that I _have_ mentioned is the most propitious _thing_ to be obtained; and inward speaking and managing the temper are a Khvêtûk-das [^74], and the high-priest _who has_ performed _it_ is to perform the ceremonial.‘"’ This passage attributes to Zaratû<i>s</i>t himself the enforcement of next-of-kin marriage, but it is hardly necessary to point out that the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> only records a tradition to that effect; which <span id="p414"><sup><small>[ p. 414 ]</small></sup></span> record may be quoted as evidence of the former existence of such a tradition, but not as testimony for its truth. It is also worthy of notice that this tradition clearly shows that such marriages were distasteful to the people in general but this might naturally be inferred from the efforts made by religious writers to assert the extraordinary merit of Khvêtûk-das, because customs which are popular and universal require no such special recommendation from the priesthood.

In the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk (XXXVII, 82, LXIV, 6, LXV, 2, LXXVII, 4, 5) allusions are made to the Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> [^75] of brother and sister, formed by the progenitors of mankind. We are also told that Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> is to be practised till the end of the world, and that to occasion it among others is an effectual atonement for heinous sin [^76] (Dd. LXXVII, 6, 7, LXXVIII, 19); but it is not certain that the term is applied in these latter passages to marriages between the _nearest_ relatives.

For later particulars about Khvêtûk-das we have to descend to the darkest ages of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, those in which the Rivâyats, or records of religious legends, customs, and decisions, began to be compiled. Of the earlier Rivâyats, such as the Shâyast Lâ-shâyast and Vi<i>g</i>irka<i>r</i><i>d</i>\-î Dînîk, which were written in Pahlavi, few remain extant; but the later ones, written in Persian, are more numerous and very voluminous.

A Pahlavi Rivâyat, which precedes the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk in many MSS. of that work, devotes several <span id="p415"><sup><small>[ p. 415 ]</small></sup></span> pages to the subject of Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, which fully confirm the statements of the defender of the practice, quoted above from the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> (III, lxxxii). The age of this Pahlavi Rivâyat is quite uncertain; it is found in MSS. written in the sixteenth century, but, as it does not mention the marriage of first cousins, it was probably compiled at a much earlier period, more especially as it is written in fairly grammatical Pahlavi. The following extracts will be sufficient to show how far it confirms the statements of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>:--

‘Of the good works of an infidel this is the greatest, when he comes out from the habit of infidelity into the good religion; and of _one_ of the good religion, remaining backward (akha<i>r</i>\-mân) _at_ the _time_ when his ritual is performed, this is a great good work, when he performs a Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>; for through that Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, which is so valuable a token of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, is the destruction of demons. And of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _it_ is declared, as regards the performance of Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, that, when Zaratû<i>s</i>t sat before Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^77], and Vohûman, Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t, Shatvaî<i>r</i>ô, Ho<i>r</i>vada<i>d</i>, Ame<i>r</i>ôda<i>d</i>, and Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^78] sat around Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> sat by his side, she had also laid a hand on his neck, _and_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t asked Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> about it thus: "Who is this _that_ sits beside thee, and thou wouldst be such a friend to her, and she also would be such a friend to thee? Thou, who art Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, turnest not _thy_ eyes away from her, and she turns not away <span id="p416"><sup><small>[ p. 416 ]</small></sup></span> from thee; thou, who art Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, dost not release her from _thy_ hand, and she does not release thee from _her_ hand [^79]." And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> said: "This is Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, who is my daughter, the house-mistress of my heaven, and mother of the creatures  [^80]." Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: "When they say, in the world, this is a very perplexing thing, how is it proclaimed by thee—thee who art Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>\—for thee _thyself?_" Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! this should have become the best-enjoyed thing of mankind. When, since my original creation, Mâharîyâ _and_ Mâharîyâôîh [^81] had performed it, you, also, should have performed it; because although mankind _have_ turned away _from_ that thing [^82], yet they should not have turned away. Just as Mâharîyâ _and_ Mâharîyâôîh had performed Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, mankind should have performed it, _and_ all mankind would have known their own lineage and race, _and_ a brother would never be deserted by the affection of his brother, _nor_ a sister _by that_ of her sister. For all nothingness, emptiness [^83], and drought _have_ come unto mankind from the deadly _one_ (mar), when men have come to them from a different country, from a different town, _or_ from a different district, and _have_ married their women; and when they shall have carried away their women, and they have <span id="p417"><sup><small>[ p. 417 ]</small></sup></span> wailed together about this, thus: ’They will always carry our daughters into perversion [^84].'"

'This, too, _is said_, that Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> is so miraculous that _it_ is the preservation of the most grievous sin—such as witchcraft and _that_ worthy of death—from hell. And the want of protection (a<i>v</i>îpâharîh) from hell _of one_ unprotected from Aharman and the demons arises at that time when, owing to what _occurs_ when _he_ is begged by _some_ one to exercise witchcraft, _he_ is made worthy of death. And when they shall perform Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, when the Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> is owing to him [^85], the unprotected _one_ is preserved from the prison of hell, _from_ Aharman _and_ the demons; so miraculous is Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>.

‘_In_ a passage _it_ is declared, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: "These are the best four things: the ceremonial worship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the lord; presenting firewood, incense, and holy-water _to_ the fire; propitiating a righteous man [^86]; and _one_ who performs Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> with her who bore _him_, or a daughter, or with a sister. And of all those he is the greatest, best, and most perfect who shall perform Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>. . . . When Sôshâns comes [^87] all mankind _will_ perform Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, and every fiend will perish through the miracle and power of Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>.’

It is then explained why the several merits of the <span id="p418"><sup><small>[ p. 418 ]</small></sup></span> three classes of Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> are considered to stand in the same order as that in which the classes are mentioned in the preceding paragraph; also that the third class includes the case of half brothers and sisters, and the second that of an illegitimate daughter. After this we find the following legend:--

And Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> is so miraculous, that _it_ is declared, regarding Yim [^88], that, when the glory _of_ his sovereignty had departed from him, he went out to the precincts (var) of the ocean with Yimak, his sister, _in order_ to flee from the people, demons, and witches of the assembly of Dahâk  [^89]. And _they were_ sought by them in hell and not seen; and others sought them among mankind, water, earth, and cattle, among trees, in the mountains, and in the towns, _but they were_ not seen by them. Then Aharman shouted thus: “I think thus, that Yim is travelling in the precincts of the ocean.” And a demon and a witch, _who_ stood among _them, spoke_ thus: “We _will_ go and seek Yim.” And they rushed _off and_ went; and when they came unto those precincts where Yim was—the precincts _where_ the water of Tîr [^90] was—Yim spoke thus: “Who are <span id="p419"><sup><small>[ p. 419 ]</small></sup></span> you?” And they spoke thus: “We are those who are just like thee, who had to flee from the hands of the demons; we, too, have fled away from the demons, and we are alone. Do thou give this sister in marriage to me, while I also give this _one_ unto thee!” And Yim, therefore, when the demons were not recognised by him from mankind, made the witch his own wife, and gave his sister unto the demon _as_ wife. From Yim and that witch were born the bear, the ape, Gandarep [^91], _and_ Gŏsûbar [^92]; _and_ from Yimak and that demon were born the tortoise (gasaf), the cat, the hawk (gavin<i>g</i>), the frog, the weevil (dîvakŏ), and also as many more noxious creatures, until Yimak saw that that demon was evil, and it was necessary to demand a divorce (zan-ta<i>k</i>â) _from_ him. And one day, when Yim _and_ that demon had become drunk with wine, she exchanged her own position and clothing with those of the witch; and when Yim came he was drunk, _and_ unwittingly lay with Yimak, who was his sister, and they came to a decision _as to_ the good work of Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>; many demons were quite crushed _and_ died, and they rushed away at once, and fell back to hell.'

The fact, that the zealous writer felt that he had to force his opinions upon an unwilling people, is betrayed by the exaggerated language he uses in the following statements:--

“This, too, is declared by the Avesta, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: “Many thoughts, many words, _and_ many deeds are mentioned by <span id="p420"><sup><small>[ p. 420 ]</small></sup></span> thee—thee who art Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>\—that it is necessary to think, speak, and do; of all _such_ thoughts, words, _and_ deeds which is the best, when _one_ shall think, speak, _or_ do it?” Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: “Many thoughts, _many_ words, _and_ many deeds should be proclaimed by me, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _but_, of those thoughts, words, _and_ deeds _which_ it is necessary to think, speak, _and_ do, that which is best and most perfect _one_ performs by Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>. For _it_ is declared that, the first time when he goes near to it, a thousand demons will die, and two thousand wizards _and_ witches; when he goes near _to_ it twice, two thousand demons will die, _and_ four thousand wizards and witches; when he goes near to _it_ three times, three thousand demons will die, _and_ six thousand wizards _and_ witches; _and_ when he goes near to it four times _it_ is known _that_ the man and woman become righteous [^93].”

“. . . . Owing to the performance of Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> _there_ arises a destruction of demons equivalent _to_ a stoppage of creation; and though, afterwards, _some_ of those men _and_ women shall become wizards, _or_ unlawfully slaughter a thousand sheep and beasts _of burden_ at one time, _or_ shall present holy-water to the demons, _yet_, on account of that destruction _and_ vexation of the demons, which has occurred to them owing to the Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, it does not become comfortable to them while completed; and _it_ is not believed by them that “the souls of those _people_ will come to us.”

“Whoever keeps one year in a marriage of Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> <span id="p421"><sup><small>[ p. 421 ]</small></sup></span> becomes just as though one-third of all this world, with the water, with the trees, and with the corn, had been given by him, as a righteous gift, unto a righteous man. When he keeps two years in the marriage _it_ is as though two-thirds of this world, with the water, trees, _and_ corn, had been given by him unto a righteous man. When he keeps three years in the marriage _it_ is as though all this world, with the water, with the trees, _and_ with everything, had been given _by him_, as a righteous gift, unto a righteous man. _And_ when he keeps four years in his marriage, and his ritual [^94] is performed, _it_ is known _that his_ soul thereby goes unto the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân); _and_ when _the ritual is_ not _performed_, it goes thereby to _the ordinary_ heaven (vahi<i>s</i>tŏ).

“Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: “_As to_ the man who _practises_ Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, and his ritual is performed, _and_ he also offers a ceremonial (ya<i>z</i><i>i</i><i>s</i>nŏaê), is the good work of it such as _if one_ without Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> _had_ offered _it, or_ which way is it?” Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> said: “_It_ is just as though a hundred men without Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> had offered it.”

“Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired this, also, of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, that is: “How is the benediction (âf_rî_nô) which a man who _practises_ Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> shall offer?” Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: “As though a hundred men without Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> _should_ offer the benediction.”

“And this, too, _was_ asked by him, that is: “_As to_ them who render assistance, _and one_ meditates and attains to Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> _through_ them, _and one_  <span id="p422"><sup><small>[ p. 422 ]</small></sup></span> performs Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> on account of their statements, how is _their_ good work?” Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: “Like _his_ who keeps in food and clothing, _for_ one winter, a hundred priests—each of which priests has a hundred disciples—_such_ is his good work.”

“Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired this, also, of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, that is: “_As to_ them who keep a man back _from_ performing Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, _and_ owing to their statements he shall not perform Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, what is their sin?” _Aûha<i>r</i>ma_zd _spoke_ [^95] thus: “_Their_ place is hell.”

“_In_ a passage _it_ is declared that, wiser than the wise, _and_ more virtuous than the virtuous is _he_ in whose thoughts, words, _and_ deeds the demons are less predominant; _and_ Aharman _and_ the demons are less predominant in the body of him who _practises_ Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, and his ritual [^96] is performed.

“_It_ is declared by revelation that _at_ the _time_ when Zaratû<i>s</i>t came out from the presence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the lord, into a worldly place where he travelled, he spoke this, that is: “Extol the religion! _and_ you should perform Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>. I speak of the good and those existing _in_ the religion; _as to_ the negligent, the vile, and those in perplexity, this is said, that a thing so wondrous _and_ important _as that_ which is in our law _of_ Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> could not be for performance. This is a sublime (kîrag) custom, _and_, as the best of all things, _one_ asserts that it is necessary to perform it. _To_ me, also, this is manifest when, through all faith _in_ the law _of_ those existing _in_ the religion [^97], that which is called by <span id="p423"><sup><small>[ p. 423 ]</small></sup></span> them a very heinous sin, through faith _in_ this law _of_ the good, is that which is called the most perfect _and_ best good work of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship.”

“This, too, is declared by revelation, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: “You should cause the performance of duties _and_ good works.” And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: “Which duty _and_ good work _shall_ I do first?” Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: “Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>; because that duty _and_ good work is to be performed in the foremost place of all, for, in the end, it happens through Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, when all who are in the world attain unto the religion [^98].”

‘This, too, is declared by revelation, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: In my eyes _it_ is an evil (va<i>d</i>ŏ) which is performed, and _it is_ perplexing that I _should_ make Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i> _as it were_ fully current among mankind." Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "In my eyes, also, _it_ is just as _in_ thine; but for this reason—when out of everything perfect _there_ is _some_ miserable evil [^99] for thee—it should not seem _so_. Do thou be diligent in performing Khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>, and others, also, will perform _it_ diligently. ’

The unpopularity of the practice advocated could hardly be more fully admitted than in this last paragraph, nor the objection more irrationally and dogmatically disposed of. As for the numerous quotations, which the compiler of this Pahlavi Rivâyat <span id="p424"><sup><small>[ p. 424 ]</small></sup></span> professes to take from the Parsi scriptures, it is hardly necessary to remark that their authenticity must be accepted with great reserve.

Persian Rivâyats, copied in the seventeenth century, advocate the marriage of first cousins, and allude vaguely to those between nearer relatives as long extinct, though most of their remarks merely recommend the performance of Khêdyôdath [^100], without explaining the meaning of the term. Thus, we are informed that a person worthy of death can perform Khêdyôdath as a good work, but it is better if followed by the Bareshnûm ceremony [^101]. An unclean person can do the same, but the Bareshnûm should precede the performance, so as to avoid sins arising from the uncleanness. The performance also destroys demons, wizards, and witches; and if arranged by any one, at his own expense, for another person, it is as meritorious as if performed by himself. But the following quotations are more descriptive of the practice [^102]:--

'Again, whereas the great wisdom of the king and of the assembly of priests fully understands that the ceremony of all the religious rites [^103] is a great good work, besides that which is called Khêdyôdath, yet, in these days, both have fallen out of _their_ hands; but they will make an endeavour, so that they may form connection with their own, and on account of <span id="p425"><sup><small>[ p. 425 ]</small></sup></span> the Musulmâns the connection is a medium _one_ [^104], better than that of an infidel. And Ormazd has said that _by_ as much as the connection is nearer _it is_ more of a good work; and they display _their_ endeavour and effort, and give the son of a brother and daughter of a brother _to_ each other. And just as this _is said_: I establish the _performer_ of Khêdyôdath, I establish the patrol of the country [^105]," even on this account they certainly display an endeavour.

‘Query:--“How are the connections that relations form?” Reply:--"A brother’s children with a brother‘s children and a sister’s children, and relations with one another form connections, _and_ it is proper for them."

_Kh_êdyôdath is _that_ which is a great good work, and has fallen out of their hands, owing to the reason that there is no king of the good religion; and if it be so they will make an endeavour, and will form connections with their own, and will give the son of a brother and daughter of a brother to each other, and if not it is not proper; and every such connection as is nearer is more of a good work. And the mode they will act who are at first without a king will be an infidel _one_, and to form connections among themselves will be very difficult now he (the king) is a Musulmân, _but_ that which is nearer is better and more of a good work.'

<span id="p426"><sup><small>[ p. 426 ]</small></sup></span>

These quotations indicate that a great change had crept over the meaning of Khvêtûk-das since the dark ages of the Pahlavi Rivâyat, previously quoted, although a tradition of the old meaning still lingered in the minds of the writers. The modern meaning is, however, most completely explained in a passage, appended to a Persian version of Aêshm's complaint to Aharman, regarding the difficulty of destroying the effect of the season-festivals, the sacred feast, and Khvetûk-das (Sls. XVIII). After Aharman has confessed his inability to suggest a means of destroying the merit of the last, the Persian writer adds the following particulars:--

‘Therefore it is necessary to understand, that the chief Khêtvadat is that of a sister’s daughter and brother‘s son; a medium Khêtvadat is that of a brother’s son and a younger brother‘s daughter, or of a sister’s son and a younger sister‘s daughter; and inferior to a medium Khêtvadat is that of a sister’s son and a younger brother‘s daughter. It is necessary to know that any person, who performs Khêtvadat, if _his_ soul be _fit_ for hell, will arrive among the ever-stationary [^106]; if it be _one_ of the ever-stationary it will arrive at heaven. Another particular is to be added: if any one, in departing, settles and strives for the connection of Khêtvadat of a next brother it is a good work of a thousand Tanâpûhars [^107]; if any one strives to break off the connection of Khêtvadat he is worthy of death.’

<span id="p427"><sup><small>[ p. 427 ]</small></sup></span>

With this quotation, which occurs in a MS. [^108] written A.D. 1723, we may conclude our examination of all passages in the Parsi scriptures referring to Khvetûk-das, the result of which may be summarized as follows:

First, the term does not occur at all in the oldest part of the Avesta, and when it is mentioned in the later portion it is noticed merely as a good work which is highly meritorious, without any allusion to its nature; only one passage (Vend. VIII, 36) indicating that both men and women can participate in it. So far, therefore, as can be ascertained from the extant fragments of the Avesta—the only internal authority regarding the ancient practices of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship—the Parsis are perfectly justified in believing that their religion did not originally sanction marriages between those who are next of kin, provided they choose to ignore the statements of foreigners, as based upon imperfect information.

Second, when we descend to the Pahlavi translations and writings of the better class, which, in their present form, probably range from the sixth to the ninth century, we find many allusions to Khvêtûk-das between those next of kin, and only one obscure reference to the marriage of first cousins [^109]. Marriages between the nearest relations are defended chiefly by reference to mythical and metaphorical <span id="p428"><sup><small>[ p. 428 ]</small></sup></span> statements regarding the creation, and to the practice of the progenitors of mankind; they are also advocated with all the warmth and vehemence that usually indicate much difficulty in convincing the laity, and this zealous vehemence increases as we descend to the dark ages of the Pahlavi Rivâyat [^110], the compilation of which may perhaps be attributed to some writer of the thirteenth or fourteenth century. Unless, therefore, the Parsis determine to reject the evidence of such Pahlavi works as the Pahlavi Yasna, the book of Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf, the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, and the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk, or to attribute those books to heretical writers, they must admit that their priests, in the later years of the Sasanian dynasty, and for some centuries subsequently, strongly advocated such next-of-kin marriages, though, probably, with little success. That a practice now reprobated by all Parsis should have been formerly advocated by their priests, as a religious duty, need not excite the surprise of those who consider how slavery has been advocated by many Christians, on scriptural grounds, within the present generation, and how the execution of supposed witches was similarly advocated a few generations ago.

Third, as we come to the modern writings of the Persian Rivâyats, which may have commenced about the fifteenth century, we find the present form of Khvêtûk-das, the marriage of first cousins (which was only slightly mentioned in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> of the ninth century), the only form in use; though obscure allusions are made to the other forms as being long extinct.

<span id="p429"><sup><small>[ p. 429 ]</small></sup></span>

At whatever period the practice of next-of-kin marriage may have originated there were evidently two reasons for its establishment and continuance; one was the indispensable necessity of offspring [^111], unfettered by duties towards any other family, for the purpose of maintaining the necessary periodical ceremonies for the souls of those passed away; the other was the wish of preventing any risk of religious perversion consequent upon marrying into a family of strangers or infidels. Both of these reasons must have become intensified as the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers diminished in numbers, hence the increasing vehemence of priestly advocacy, until the foreign conquerors probably interfered, and put a stop to the practice.

That such marriages were not unusual among other races, in ancient times, we learn from many tales in Greek and Roman mythology, from the usual practice of the Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies in Egypt, and even from the laws prohibiting such connections in Lev. xviii. 6-16, which, as laws are not made to prohibit practices that do not exist, would hardly have been written unless the children of Israel had at one time adopted the custom to some slight extent. That Parsis now deny the existence of such marriages among their ancestors proves that they no longer approve the custom, but does not affect the historical evidence of its former <span id="p430"><sup><small>[ p. 430 ]</small></sup></span> existence. Christians no longer approve the persecution and execution of women for the imaginary crime of witchcraft, but it would be both childish and useless for them to deny that their ancestors committed hundreds of such judicial murders less than two centuries ago.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (389:1) See Dastûr Peshotanji's translation of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, D. 96, note.

[^2]: (390:1) Occasionally written Khvêtûk-dat, as in Pahl. Vend. VIII, 36 (see [p. 392](.)).

[^3]: (391:1) See p. 387, note 3.

[^4]: (392:1) The age of this Pahlavi version of the Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Vast is doubtful, and it is even possible that it may have been composed in India. The only MS. of it that I have seen belongs to Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji, who kindly gave me a copy of it, but seemed doubtful about-the age of the translation. He was aware that his MS. was written some forty years ago, but he did not know from what MS. it was copied. This version is, however, mentioned in the list of Pahlavi works given in the introduction to Dastûr Peshotanji's Pahlavi Grammar, pp. 18, 31, so that another MS. of the Pahlavi text probably exists in the library of the high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay.

[^5]: (392:2) Or, perhaps, ‘man _and_ wife;’ as gab<i>r</i>â, ‘man,’ is occasionally used for ‘husband,’ though shûî is the usual word, and nê<i>s</i>man means both ‘woman’ and ‘wife.’

[^6]: (392:3) Written Khvêtvadas or Khvêtûdas in the very old MS. of Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji, the text of which is followed in this translation. The phrases in brackets have no equivalents in the original Avesta text, and, therefore, merely represent the opinions of the Pahlavi translators.

[^7]: (392:4) Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> apparently, as indicated by the sequel.

[^8]: (393:1) The Pahlavi translator seems here to understand Vohûman not as the archangel (see Dd. III, 3), but as a title (‘good-minded’) of the primeval man, Gâyômar<i>d</i>, who is supposed to have been produced by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> out of the earth (compare Gen. ii. 7), represented by the female archangel Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>. The term vohû-manô is used in Vend. XIX, 69, 76-84 for both a well-intentioned man and his clothing.

[^9]: (393:2) The female archangel, a personification of the Avesta phrase spe<i>n</i>ta ârmaiti, ‘bountiful devotion;’ she has special charge of the earth and virtuous women (see Bd. I, 26, Sls. XV, 20-24). She is called the daughter of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, even as the fire and Vohûman are called his sons, because devotion (representing the earth), fire, and good thought are considered to be his most important creations. And, as the earth is also, metaphorically, the mother of man, and the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is figuratively his father, this unfortunate combination of anthropomorphisms has induced later superstition to take these statements literally, and to quote them as a justification of marriage between father and daughter.

[^10]: (393:3) This seems the most probable nominative to the verbs in this sentence, but it is by no means certain.

[^11]: (394:1) See pp. 396, 401, 416.

[^12]: (394:2) See Zs. V, 4.

[^13]: (394:3) See Ep. III, 2, 17, 21.

[^14]: (394:4) See Ep. I, iv, 17, note.

[^15]: (394:5) This is proved by the long quotation from Dk. VI contained in Dd. XCIV, 1-11.

[^16]: (395:1) A height of about 42 English feet (see Dd. XLIII, 5).

[^17]: (395:2) That is, the capability of expelling the, fiends that try to take possession of man.

[^18]: (395:3) Reading gâm (= kâm), but it may be dâm, 'creature:

[^19]: (396:1) That is, the useful peculiarities of a particular breed of domestic animals are maintained and intensified by keeping up the purity of the race.

[^20]: (396:2) ‘Complete mindfulness’ is the usual Pahlavi explanation of Av. ârmaiti, ‘devotion,’ the latter component of the name Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>.

[^21]: (396:3) See pp. 392, 393.

[^22]: (397:1) See Ep. I, iv, 17.

[^23]: (397:2) The word translated ‘all’ is the ordinary Huz. ko<i>l</i>â, equivalent p. 398 to Pers. har, but a Parsi critic has suggested that it ought to be read kanîk, ‘virgin,’ so as to get rid of the idea that the sisters were married to Vîrâf. This suggestion is ingenious, because the difference between ko<i>l</i>â and kanîk is very slight, when written in Pahlavi characters; but it is not very ingenuous, because the substitution of kanîk for kola, both here and in the similar phrase at the end of the passage quoted in our text, would render the sentences quite ungrammatical, as would be easily seen by any well-educated Parsi who would translate the phrases literally into modern Persian words, which would give him the following text: ân har haft ‘<i>h</i>vâharân Vîrâf <i>k</i>ûn zan bûd and for the first phrase, and har haft ‘<i>h</i>vâhar ân birâdar zanî êm for the second. To substitute any Persian word for ‘virgin’ in place of the pronoun har, in these two phrases, would evidently produce nonsense. The really doubtful point in these phrases is whether zan and zanî are to be understood as ‘wife’ and ‘wifehood,’ or merely as ‘woman’ and ‘womankind;’ but it would be unusual to use such terms for the unmarried female members of a family.

[^24]: (398:1) Or ‘the womankind.’

[^25]: (398:2) From a facsimile of the only known MS. of the original Pahlavi p. 399 text of this work, recently published by Dr. Andreas, it appears that its Pahlavi name was Dînâ-î Mînavad-î Khar<i>d</i> (or Maînôg-î Khir<i>d</i>), ‘the opinions of the spirit of wisdom.’

[^26]: (399:1) See Sacred Books of the East, vol. v, pp. liii-lvi.

[^27]: (399:2) See Byt. II, 57, 61.

[^28]: (399:3) The name of this editor was Âtû<i>r</i>\-pad, son of Hêmî<i>a</i>, as appears from the last chapter (chap. 413) of the same book. He was a contemporary of the author of the Dâ<i>d</i>istan-î Dînîk (see Bd. XXXIII, 11).

[^29]: (399:4) Chap. 80 in the recent edition of Dastûr Peshotanji Behramji, because his numbers do not commence at the beginning of the book. His translation of this chapter (see pp. [90](/en/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_2/Dadistan_i_Dinik_37#p90)\-[102](/en/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_2/Dadistan_i_Dinik_37#p102) of the English translation of his edition) differs considerably from that given in our text. This difference may be partly owing to its being translated from the Gu<i>g</i>arâti translation, and not direct from the original Pahlavi; but it is chiefly due to the inevitable result of attempting a free translation of difficult Pahlavi, without preparing a literal version in the first place. The translation here given is as literal as possible, but the Pahlavi text is too obscure to be yet understood with absolute certainty in some places.

[^30]: (400:1) Literally ‘bearer’ (bûr<i>d</i>âr), which is not the usual word for ‘mother,’ but equivalent to the Av. baretar that is used in that sense.

[^31]: (401:1) See p. 393, note 2.

[^32]: (401:2) See Dd. II, 10, XXXVII, 82, LXIV, 5.

[^33]: (401:3) It is uncertain whether the high-priest's statement continues beyond this point, or not.

[^34]: (401:4) See Bd. XV, 1, 2, Dd. LXIV, 6.

[^35]: (402:1) See Dd. XXXVII, 82, LXIV, 2, LXV, 2, LXXVII, 4, where these names are spelt differently.

[^36]: (402:2) Literally ‘have become and have become.’

[^37]: (402:3) See Bd. XV, 22, 24-26.

[^38]: (402:4) The demons’.

[^39]: (402:5) Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s.

[^40]: (403:1) The offspring of such a match, which the apologist evidently considers an ill-assorted one, as tending to deteriorate the warlike qualities of the warrior's descendants, although he himself is no advocate for war.

[^41]: (403:2) As their parents.

[^42]: (403:3) Dastûr Peshotanji has ‘four,’ because the Pahlavi text seems p. 404 to speak of four species in the next sentence; here it seems to have ‘six’ in ciphers, but the first cipher can also be read aê, the conditional suffix to the verb which immediately precedes the ciphers in the Pahlavi text, and the second cipher is merely ‘three,’ which corresponds to the three possible kinds of first cousins that are about to be detailed in the text.

[^43]: (404:1) Reading zak-î instead of zî<i>s</i> (which might be read zakîh if there were such a word).

[^44]: (404:2) Literally ‘brother.’

[^45]: (404:3) Literally 'sister:

[^46]: (404:4) Reading zak-î instead of zî<i>s</i>, as before. This is Dastûr Peshotanji's fourth species of cousinship, which he understands as meaning second cousins.

[^47]: (404:5) Reading 13, by dividing the Pahlavi cipher for ‘four’ into two parts, both here and near the end of the sentence. This paragraph can hardly be understood otherwise than referring to the present form of Khvêtûk-das, the marriage of first cousins.

[^48]: (405:1) Reading amat instead of mûn, ‘who,’ (see Dd. LXII, 4 n.)

[^49]: (405:2) Showing that the practice advocated was understood to be a regular marriage (performed in private probably on account of the authorities being of a foreign faith) and not any kind of irregular intercourse. It is here approvingly contrasted with the noisy celebration of a marriage with a person of foreign faith, in accordance with foreign customs.

[^50]: (406:1) A native of Asia Minor, or any other part of the eastern empire of the Romans.

[^51]: (407:1) That is, lest he should pronounce her divorce.

[^52]: (407:2) The three nearest degrees of relationship must be meant, as the sequel admits the possibility of the union being considered objectionable; otherwise, the three kinds of first cousins might be understood.

[^53]: (407:3) As a special pleader for marriage between near relations the apologist feels himself bound to argue that all bad wives must have been strangers to the family before marriage.

[^54]: (408:1) That is, those who admire flat noses select their beauties accordingly. Beauty being merely a matter of taste, which varies with the whim of the individual and the fashion of the period.

[^55]: (408:2) This law was evidently becoming obsolete at the time the apologist was writing, and is now wholly forgotten. All Parsi laymen have their heads shaved at the present time, although the priests merely have their hair closely cut. This change of custom, in a matter settled by religious law, should warn the Parsis not to deny the possibility of other complete alterations having taken place in their religious customs.

[^56]: (408:3) Khvêtûk-das.

[^57]: (409:1) Khvêtûk-das.

[^58]: (409:2) Perhaps the law of the foreign conquerors is meant.

[^59]: (409:3) See Dd. XXXVII, 35, XL, 3.

[^60]: (410:1) See Dd. XCIII, 13 n.

[^61]: (410:2) Into the forms of moisture and warmth in the body. Water and fire in their ordinary state being incapable of combination.

[^62]: (410:3) This will be the 193rd chapter in Dastûr Peshotanji's edition, because his numbers do not commence at the beginning of the book. A similar difference will be found in the numbering of all other chapters of the third book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>.

[^63]: (410:4) The technical name of Yas.

[^64]: (411:1) Av. Akhtya of Âbân Yt. 82, who propounded ninety-nine enigmas to Yôi<i>s</i>tô of the Fryâns (see Dd. XC, 3).

[^65]: (411:2) See Dd. XCIV, 1 n.

[^66]: (411:3) The sole-created man (see Dd. II, 10, XXXVII, 82).

[^67]: (411:4) See p. 402, note 1.

[^68]: (412:1) See 396, note 2.

[^69]: (412:2) See 400, note 1.

[^70]: (412:3) See [384](/en/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_2/Appendix_2#p384), note 1.

[^71]: (413:1) The word hû-nô<i>s</i>akŏ is the Pahlavi equivalent of Av. hunu<i>s</i>tâ (Yas. L, 10, b), but the meaning of both words is uncertain. This Tar seems to have been more friendly to Zaratû<i>s</i>t than the Tûrânians were in general, but he appears not to be mentioned in the extant Avesta.

[^72]: (413:2) As this epithet has not been found in the extant Avesta, the reading is uncertain.

[^73]: (413:3) Meaning that they demanded possession of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in an insolent manner.

[^74]: (413:4) In a figurative sense.

[^75]: (414:1) Another form of the word Khvetûk-das (see [p. 390](#p390)).

[^76]: (414:2) This is also stated in Sls. VII, 18.

[^77]: (415:1) As he is said to have done in heaven, when receiving instruction in the religion.

[^78]: (415:2) The archangels (see Dd. XLVIII, i n), of whom Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is said to be a female (see p. 393, note 2).

[^79]: (416:1) This legend is an instance of the close proximity of superstition to profanity, among uneducated and imaginative people.

[^80]: (416:2) She being a representative of the earth.

[^81]: (416:3) See [p. 402](.), note 1.

[^82]: (416:4) That is, from marriage of the nearest relations, which is admitted, throughout these extracts, to be distasteful to the people; hence the vehemence with which it is advocated.

[^83]: (416:5) Literally ‘air-stuffing’ (vâê-âkînîh).

[^84]: (417:1) This fear of perversion to another faith was, no doubt, the real cause of the vehement advocacy of family marriages by the priesthood.

[^85]: (417:2) That is, when he has arranged the next-of-kin marriage of others, before his death.

[^86]: (417:3) That is, a priest.

[^87]: (417:4) Shortly before the resurrection (see Dd. II, 10).

[^88]: (418:1) The third sovereign of the world, after Gâyômar<i>d</i> (see Dd. II, 10). This legend is also mentioned in Bd. XXIII, 1, as explaining the origin of the ape and bear.

[^89]: (418:2) The foreign king, or dynasty, that conquered Vim (see Dd. XXXVII, 97 n).

[^90]: (418:3) Evidently intended for Tî<i>s</i>tar, a personification of the star Sirius, who is supposed to bring the rain from the ocean (see Dd. XCIII, 1-17). Strictly speaking Tîr is the planet Mercury, the opponent of Tî<i>s</i>tar, whose name is given to the fourth month, and thirteenth day of the month, in the Parsi year (see Bd. V, 1, VII, 2, XXVII, 24); but the confusion between the two names is not uncommon in the later books (comp. Sls. XXII, 13 with XXIII, 2).

[^91]: (419:1) See [p. 371](/en/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_2/Appendix_1#p371), note 3.

[^92]: (419:2) Not identified, and the reading is, therefore, uncertain.

[^93]: (420:1) Or, as stated in the Appendix to the Shâyast Lâ-shâyast (Sls. XVIII, 4), they ‘_will_ not become parted from the possession of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels.’

[^94]: (421:1) The proper ceremonies after his death, or for his living soul during his lifetime (see Dd. XXVIII, LXXXI).

[^95]: (422:1) The Pahlavi text is imperfect.

[^96]: (422:2) See [p. 421](#p421), note 1.

[^97]: (422:3) That is, the general law of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, as distinguished from what he is advocating as a peculiarly religious law sanctioned p. 432 by the priests (‘the good’). This is evidently an admission that the practice advocated was contrary to the ordinary laws of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship itself.

[^98]: (423:1) As Pahlavi writers expect them to do before the resurrection.

[^99]: (423:2) Reading va<i>d</i>ŏ-î vêsht; but it may be ‘_something_ is difficult and hard’ (tang va sakht).

[^100]: (424:1) The Persian form of the word Khvetûk-das. It is also written Khetyôdath in some passages, and Khêtvadat in others.

[^101]: (424:2) The great ceremony of purification (see App. IV).

[^102]: (424:3) The Persian Rivâyat from which all this information has been extracted is M10 (fol. 50 a).

[^103]: (424:4) See Dd. XLIV, 2 II.

[^104]: (425:1) This seems to be an allusion to some interference of the Muhammadan government with marriages of those next of kin. A similar allusion occurs in the next paragraph but one, which, with most of this paragraph, is also found in M7, fols. 229 b, 230 a.

[^105]: (425:2) This Avesta quotation, from Visp. III, 18, 19, is as follows ‘<i>h</i><i>v</i>aêtvadathem âstâya, daNhâurvaêsem âstâya;’ and the meaning of the last term is uncertain.

[^106]: (426:1) See Dd. XX, 3.

[^107]: (426:2) See Dd. LXXVIII, 13. Geldner in his Studien zum Avesta, I, pp. 3-12, suggests that the original meaning of Av. tanuperetha and peshôtanu was outcast;‘ but, although these words are translated by Pahl. tanâpûhar, it is doubtful whether this last p. 427 word be a mere transcript of tanuperetha (which ought to have been tanûpûhar), or whether it expresses the different idea of tan-apûhar, ’a person without a bridge _to heaven_,' which might have been that adopted by the Pahlavi translators of the Vendidâ<i>d</i>; an outcast in this world being very liable to be considered as an outcast from the next.

[^108]: (427:1) M5, fols. 54, 55.

[^109]: (427:2) In Dk. III, lxxxii (see [p. 404](.)).

[^110]: (428:1) See pp. 415-423.

[^111]: (429:1) The oriental feeling of such a necessity, for the mere purpose of perpetuating the family, is abundantly manifested in the story of Lot‘s daughters (Gen. xix. 30-38), which is related without reproval by its writer. Also by the exceptional law requiring a man to marry his brother’s wife, when the brother has died childless (Deut. xxv. 5-10).
