## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XCIV.

1\. And [^3] those of the primitive faith, the ancients of those acquainted with the religion [^4], thus considered, _that_ in the _spirit of_ life (ahvô) [^5] there is <span id="p270"><sup><small>[ p. 270 ]</small></sup></span> a thought and one appointed who [^1] holds the position (gâs), _and_ there is a fiend who stops [^2] the way; and in the thought there is a word appointed which holds the position, _and_ there is a fiend who stops the way [^3]. 2. In the _spirit of_ life [^4] is a thought _and_ Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^5] (‘bountiful devotion’) holds the position, _and_ the fiend Tarômat [^6] (‘scornful thought’) stops the way; in the thought is a word _and_ Ar<i>d</i> [^7] (‘the righteous’) holds the position, and Varenô [^8] (‘lust’) stops the way; in the word is a deed _and_ Dînô [^9] (‘religion’), the good, holds the position, and self-conceit <span id="p271"><sup><small>[ p. 271 ]</small></sup></span> (khû<i>d</i>\-dôshagîh)stops the way. 3. We men of all descriptions [^1] have to become very [^2] cautious that, while we do not desist from that way [^3], we do not go on to the way of the demons _and_ fiends [^4]. 4. For the struggling of men [^5] is _in_ these three [^6] ways and paths; _and_ whoever is saved in these three [^6] ways and paths is saved from every place, and whoever is misled there comes into the hands of the demons _and_ fiends [^7], and is thenceforth not master (<i>s</i>alîtâ) of himself, except when he shall do that which the fiends order him [^8].

5\. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that that nature only is good when it [^9] shall not do unto another whatever is not good for its own self [^10]; and that wisdom only is good when it thoroughly [^11] understands _how_ to utilize the advantage [^12] of that happiness which has occurred, _and_ shall [^13] not suffer vexation _on account of_ harm which has not occurred; and that intellect only is good which <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> understands that it does not understand that which it does not understand.

6\. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that _one_ is to become [^1] a friend of every one, and this is thy nature [^2]; also, bring them on into [^3] goodness, and, this is thy wisdom; also, consider them as thine own, and this is thy religion;, also, through them it shall produce [^4] happiness, and this is thy soul [^5].

7\. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that, when [^6] _one_ shall do even that which he knows to be sin [^7], that is disobedience; _and_ disobedience is the nature of the adversary; when _one_ shall not do even that which he knows to be a good work, that is cupidity (varenôîkîh), _and_ cupidity is the wisdom of the adversary [^8]; _and_ when _one_ shall do [^9] even that which he does not know _to be_ a good work or a sin, until it comes fully to [^10] _his_ knowledge, <span id="p273"><sup><small>[ p. 273 ]</small></sup></span> that is self-conceit, and self-conceit is the religion of the adversary [^1].

8\. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that Aharman [^2] would do everything for the injury of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _but_ when it is done by him [^3] _it_ is then an injury of him himself, _and_ an advantage of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> would do everything for his own advantage, _and_ when it is done by him _it_ is then, indeed [^4], an advantage of him himself, _but_ an injury of Aharman [^5]. <span id="p274"><sup><small>[ p. 274 ]</small></sup></span> 9\. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that a person of whatever description is to be kept [^1] in remembrance of the affairs of the spirit at every period and time, and _of_ the happiness of heaven _and_ misery of hell at that period when comfort, happiness, and pleasure have come to him.

10\. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them [^2], that happiness, indeed, would be there, in the heaven of light [^3], when even here _it_ is so happy, though, owing to many _things_ [^4], Aharman--with whom the happiness there is not connected--is even here so happy at the time when distress, vexation, _and_ misery have come hereto; _and_ this, too, _was_ thus considered, that evils, indeed, would be there, in hell, when here is such misery, though even here much _of_ the earthly happiness _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>\-- <span id="p275"><sup><small>[ p. 275 ]</small></sup></span> with whom the misery there is not connected--is here so evil.

11\. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that that person is the more fortunate [^1], in whom the soundness of body, happiness, and energy (râyînisnŏ) [^2]; _who_ has done those things _about_ which the last wish of him who departs from the world is then thus: ‘I _will_ strive to do more;’ _and who_ shall have exercised much complete abstinence from those things _about_ which his last wish, when he departs from the world, is then such as ‘I _will_ strive to do less, and it would have occurred more comfortably for my soul [^3].’

12\. Do you good people of those of the good religion of these countries of Irân keep in use the laws appointed _by_ those of the primitive faith who _were_ high-priests, so that your bodies _may_ become more renowned, _and your_ souls more perfect, in the radiant supreme heaven which [^4] is the seat of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels, _of_ the angels _and_ all the guardian spirits of the righteous. 13. So these are so many answers of the questions provided, and are given explanatorily from the exposition of the religion _and_ the statements of the high-priests _of_  <span id="p276"><sup><small>[ p. 276 ]</small></sup></span> those of the primitive faith, and _are_ the nature of the teachings _that_ Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim [^1], pontiff (ra<i>d</i>ŏ) of Pârs and Kirmân [^2], and director (farmâ<i>d</i>âr) [^3] of the profession of priests, ordered to write.

14\. Steadfast in the propitiation and praise of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is the righteousness of obtainments of prayers, perfect is Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ one _only_ is the way [^4] which righteousness obtains, the others are no ways; homage to the exalted pontiff _sent_ from the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the heavenly, most righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân.

15\. Completed in peace and pleasure, joy _and_ delight;. happy for him who reads, _and_ happier for him who keeps _it_ in use and shall take his duty therefrom [^5], if they exist unto time eternal.

## Footnotes

[^3]: (269:3) The first eleven sections of this chapter are quoted from the beginning of the sixth book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, which commences as follows:--‘The propitiation of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is even in the benedictions of the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship; this, too, was the settled decision of those of the primitive faith. The sixth _book_ is on a compendium (vasang) which _was_ prepared by those of the primitive faith to maintain about the sayings of the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship;’ and then proceeds as in our text, with the variations and additional matter mentioned in the foot-notes. It is hardly probable that these quotations were intended as a conclusion to any reply, the beginning of which may be lost, as they refer to a variety of subjects; but they may have been selected by the author as authoritative opinions sufficiently comprehensive for his general peroration. At any rate they show that the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> must have been in existence in its present form before the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk was written. All the MSS. have this peroration written continuously with the preceding chapter, without stop or break of any kind to indicate a change of subject.

[^4]: (269:4) Dk. has ‘the ancients of the wise.’

[^5]: (269:5) Dk. adds ‘of men.’

[^1]: (270:1) Dk. has ‘which is appointed and,’ &c.

[^2]: (270:2) Literally ‘holds.’

[^3]: (270:3) It is evident from the context that something is omitted here, and Dk. supplies the following:--‘and in the word there is a deed _for_ the appointed position, _and_ there is a fiend who stops the way. And in the _spirit of_ life is a heart (vâlôm) _and_ Vohûman (“good thought”) holds the position, and Akômanô (“evil thought”) stops the way; and in the heart is a will _and_ Srôsh (“attention”) holds the position, and Aeshm (“wrath”) stops the way.’ It seems probable that the author did not mean to quote the latter sentence of this passage.

[^4]: (270:4) Dk. has ‘and in the will.’

[^5]: (270:5) The female archangel, who is a personification of Av. spe<i>n</i>ta ârmaiti, and has special charge of the earth and virtuous women (see Bd. I, 26, Sls. XV, 20-24).

[^6]: (270:6) Here written Tarôkmatŏ (Av. tarômaiti); he is the arch-demon of disobedience, also called Nâûnghas (see Bd. XXVIII, 14, XXX, 29).

[^7]: (270:7) Av. areta, a title of the female angel Arshi<i>s</i>ang or Ashi<i>s</i>ang (Av. ashi<i>s</i> vanguhi, ‘good rectitude’), whose name is given to the 25th day of the Parsi month (see Bd. XXII, 4, XXVII, 24, Sls. XXII, 25, XXIII, 4).

[^8]: (270:8) Av. varena, ‘desire,’ personified as a demon (see Bd. XXVIII, 25).

[^9]: (270:9) Av. daêna personified as an angel whose name is given to the tenth month and 24th day of the month of the Parsi year, and is also coupled with the names of other angels to form appellations p. 271 for the 8th, 15th, and 23rd days (see Bd. XXV, 3, r 1, 20, Sls. XXII, 8, 15, 23, 24, XXIII, 4). Dk. omits the epithet ‘good.’

[^1]: (271:1) Dk. omits the words ‘of all descriptions;’ it also places § 3 after § 4.

[^2]: (271:2) Dk. omits ‘very.’

[^3]: (271:3) Dk. has ‘from the way of the angels.’

[^4]: (271:4) Dk. has ‘go after the fiends.’

[^5]: (271:5) Dk. has ‘and the struggling of the fiend with men,’ and places this section after § 2.

[^6]: (271:6) Dk. has ‘such’ instead of ‘three’ in both places.

[^7]: (271:7) Dk. has ‘comes then to the hands of the fiends.’

[^8]: (271:8) Dk. then proceeds with § 3, ‘and we men have to become cautious,’ &c.

[^9]: (271:9) Dk. has ‘which,’ instead of ‘when it,’ both here and in the next clause.

[^10]: (271:10) Dk. has ‘for itself.’

[^11]: (271:11) Dk. omits ‘thoroughly.’

[^12]: (271:12) Literally ‘to eat the fruit’

[^13]: (271:13) Dk. has ‘does.’

[^1]: (272:1) Dk. has ‘it is the becoming.’

[^2]: (272:2) Dk. has ‘wisdom.’

[^3]: (272:3) Or ‘through.’ Dk. omits this clause, substituting ‘and this, too, _was_ thus considered by them.’

[^4]: (272:4) Dk. has ‘do thou produce.’

[^5]: (272:5) Dk. continues as follows:--‘And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that nature is that which deceives no one, wisdom is that which does not deceive itself, and religion is that which is whatever knows where _one_ should perform good works.’

[^6]: (272:6) Reading amat, instead of mûn, ‘which,’ in all three clauses (see Chap. LXII, 4 n); Dk. omits the word altogether.

[^7]: (272:7) Dk. has ‘shall not do even that which he knows to be a good work,’ as in the second clause which it omits.

[^8]: (272:8) This clause is omitted by M14, J, BK, and the oldest MS. of Dk.; later MSS. of Dk. give it as follows: ‘should they do even that they know to be a sin, that is lustful (varenôîk), and lustful is the wisdom of the adversary.’

[^9]: (272:9) Dk. has ‘does.’

[^10]: (272:10) Dk. has ‘before it comes unto.’

[^1]: (273:1) In Dk. the following is here inserted:--‘And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that in _one’s_ nature there is no wisdom, _but_ in wisdom _there_ is nature, and in religion are both wisdom _and_ nature. It is known _how_ to manage the affairs of the spirit by the nature, they are preserved by wisdom, and the soul is preserved by a union of both. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that shame is that which should not allow _one_ to commit sin, and disgrace is that it would not allow to cause. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that the essential thing of the primitive faith is freedom from sin. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that _one_ becomes diligent about that _with_ which _he_ is conversant. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that the good thoughts that are in the records of the religion of every kind _one should_ always put fully into practice, so far as he understands _them_. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the lord, produced these creatures through _his_ nature, maintains _them_ through wisdom, and forces them back to himself through religion.'

[^2]: (273:2) The evil spirit (see Chaps. II, 11, XIX, 1).

[^3]: (273:3) Or ‘when he has done it,’ which would be expressed by the same words.

[^4]: (273:4) Dk. omits ‘indeed.’

[^5]: (273:5) In Dk. the following is here inserted:--‘And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that people are to keep an eye most diligently on the world _for_ these three things: that which is realisable _by_ a sinner through sin, a follower made famous, _and_ to beg the recompense of good works from the spirits: and keeping their eye on the world is said _to be_ this, that _it is he_ who observes himself, so that _a part_ of whatever he really desires he should always perform. And this, too, _was_ thus considered by them, that three p. 273 things which are very difficult to do are even such as these: one is not to render the sinfulness famous by the sin; one is not to exalt the opinions of the fiend, and the various sovereignties of the evil _one_, for the sake of wealth; and one is to beg the recompense of good works from the spirits, _and_ not from the world.’

[^1]: (274:1) Dk. has merely ‘keeps.’

[^2]: (274:2) Dk. has ‘this, too, is to be considered,’ as a continuation of the preceding section.

[^3]: (274:3) Dk. omits ‘of light.’

[^4]: (274:4) The oldest MS. of Dk. has ‘though _some_ of the much happiness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>,’ &c., as in the latter part of the section, omitting the passage referring to Aharman and hell; later MSS., however, insert a modified version of the omitted passage, and read as follows: ‘When even here _it_ is so happy at the period when it should be distressing _and_ the mischievous vexation of much pain has come; this, too, is to be considered, that misery, indeed, is the calamity (âfatŏ) there in hell, when even here _it_ is so, though _some_ of the much happiness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>,’ &c.. as before. This interpolation in Dk. is evidently modern (as the word âfatŏ is Arabic and not Pahlavi), and was probably composed by a copyist in India who was acquainted with the text of Dk.

[^1]: (275:1) Dk. has ‘that a person is most fortunate in that.’

[^2]: (275:2) M14 and J have ‘are the appearance of health of body and pleasure;’ Dk. has ‘is the appearance of perfection.’

[^3]: (275:3) Dk. concludes as follows: ‘_who has_ done those things which are done, _about_ which _on his_ last day--when the things of the world depart--his wish is then thus, that ’more endeavour should be made by me;‘ _and has exercised_ much abstinence from those things _about_ which his last day’s wish is this, that the endeavour made should not be made.' The quotations from Dk. end at this point.

[^4]: (275:4) Reading mûn, as in M14 and J, instead of amat, ‘when,’ (see Chap. LXII, 4 n.)

[^1]: (276:1) See [p. 3](sbe18009_htm.html), note 2.

[^2]: (276:2) The two southern provinces of Persia, bordering on the Persian Gulf.

[^3]: (276:3) This title seems to be always spelt in Pahlavi with â in the middle syllable, so that the form framaDHâr in Nŏldeke‘s Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 9, must be looked upon as an Arabic corruption, and the idea that it means ’a preceder or one who has precedence‘ can hardly be maintained. It probably stands for farmâî<i>d</i>âr, ’a director or commander,‘ not in a military sense. It occurs also in Bd. XXXIII, 2, where the title ’a great farmâ<i>d</i>âr‘ is evidently equivalent to ’prime minister, or grand vazîr,' but applied to a priest, as farmâ<i>d</i>âr is here and in Chap. XLV, 5.

[^4]: (276:4) Reading râs, as in M14, instead of ra, which is merely an imperfect word. This clause of the sentence is a slight modification of a well-known quotation (said to be taken from the lost part of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask) which is often used in perorations.

[^5]: (276:5) Or ‘who keeps to duty and shall do his duty thereby.’
