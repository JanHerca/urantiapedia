## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XLVII.

1\. _As to_ the forty-sixth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: At a sacred feast (myazd) [^1] of those of the good religion, in which _there_ are fifty or a hundred men, more or less, just as it happens, and seven men who are _engaged_ in the performance of the religious rite (dînô) which is celebrated by them are feasting together with them, of those seven men there are _some_ who are easily [^2] able to pray five sections (vîdak) [^3], and _some_ six subdivisions (vakhshi<i>s</i>nŏ), of the Avesta, _but_ no chapter (fargar<i>d</i>ŏ) [^4] of the commentary (zand) is <span id="p156"><sup><small>[ p. 156 ]</small></sup></span> easy to them; and all seven of them are disputing about the right (râs) to the foremost places. 2. And he to whom thirty chapters in [^5] the commentary are easy speaks thus: ‘The foremost place is mine, and it became my place owing to great retentiveness _of memory_, for I know the commentary well and “the proper _and_ improper [^6];” and my place must be good, for whenever I do not indicate this as the place of religion unto the people I am not in the security of religion; _but_ you should not dispute about my place, for _it_ is not becoming to dispute _it_, because this neglect and outlandishness (an-aîrîh), which _some one_ brings constantly into the religion, is not _due_ to me.’ 3. Those seven men, moreover, speak constantly unto him thus: ‘Our place is _more_ important and must ever be _so_, for every man of us is able to pray several sections in his own officiating priestly duty (zôtîh), _and_ it is ever necessary to consider who is more participating in sharing a reward.’ 4. Then _as to_ those whose Avesta is very easy, or him who knows the commentary _and_ ‘the proper _and_ improper’ well, and _their_ goodness and greatness, as asked by us in this chapter, direct _some one_ to make _them_ clear unto us, for when he demonstrates the littleness and greatness in this <span id="p157"><sup><small>[ p. 157 ]</small></sup></span> subject his great religion is then completely an advantage.

5\. The reply is this, that, as to that which you ask _me_ to write, so that they may decide _whether_ thirty chapters in the commentary are easier, _or_ really the other, be they five _or_ be they six sections of the Avesta, are easier, _there_ is no deciding, because which are the chapters and which the sections? 6. For, as regards more cleverness and less cleverness, it is not clear; there are _some_ of the sections greater than many sections, and there are chapters _as_ great _as_ many chapters, but to understand severally the divisions (buri<i>s</i>) and enumeration of him to whom five sections of the Avesta are easy, _and_ also of him whose thirty chapters in the commentary are easy, it is necessary for making the calculation to consider every single division in the commentary as _equivalent to_ seven _equal_ divisions apart from the commentary [^7]. 7. And it is thereby thus manifest who _has_ skill _in the one_ and who _has_ skill _in the other_ [^8], and whoever _has_ less, when there is nothing in it regarding which _he_ is otherwise _than_ when the superintending command _of_ rulers (khtû<i>d</i>âyân) delivered over to him the place of duty—or on account of a new officiating priestly duty or directorship (ra<i>d</i>îh) of the season festivals [^9], or the <span id="p158"><sup><small>[ p. 158 ]</small></sup></span> foremost places _being_ occupied, or like causes he becomes otherwise—is fit for all the great share _and_ very good estimation of the place of _one_ much more skilful, when their _being_ fitting _and_ skilful, or _their_ excess _or_ deficiency, is not specially manifest from their skill [^10]. 8. And him to whom the commentary is very easy, _having_ prayed much, it _has_ seemed important to consider more thriving proportionable to _his_ eating [^11].

9\. And great and ample respect for both their ways of worthiness is an advantage _and_ fully necessary, skill in the commentary _and_ that in the Avesta _being_ together mutually assisting; for even the solemnizers of the Avesta _have_ need for information from the commentary about the scattered (parvand) ‘proper _and_ improper’ _usages_ of the sacred ceremony. 10. The more efficient information from the commentary is advantageous when the ceremonial is proceeded with by them, and one of those two is one of the skilful, _and_ a friend, provider, glorifier, and aggrandizer for the other; and the friends of religion are good friends and, therefore, also providers of fame for both of them. <span id="p159"><sup><small>[ p. 159 ]</small></sup></span> 11\. When, too, they are publishing accusing statements, one about the other, from necessity, or from the violence which is owing to the adversary [^12], _it_ is important to become an excuser as regards them, and not a diminisher of their share, _nor_ a bringer (âkhtâr) of unhealthiness to _their_ united strength.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (155:3) The sacred feast consists of the consecration of the sacred cakes (see Chap. XXX, r), followed by that of wine and fruit with the recitation of the Âfrîngân or blessings (see Haug's Essays, p. 408), after which the consecrated food and drink are consumed by those present, both priests and laymen.

[^2]: (155:4) That is, they know the prayers by heart, which is necessary in reciting the Avesta.

[^3]: (155:5) Compare Pers. vaî, vîd, vîdâ, ‘part, little,’ <i>g</i>uz, ‘a portion, a bundle of folios.’ M14 has nask, ‘book,’ but this is clearly an unlucky guess.

[^4]: (155:6) The chapters of the Vendidâ<i>d</i> are called fargar<i>d</i>s, as are also p. 156 those of the Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Ya<i>s</i>t and many of the lost Nasks or books. The text here applies the term specially to the chapters of some scripture with commentary, and it may be noted that the thirty; fargar<i>d</i>s, subsequently mentioned, are the exact number contained in the Vendidâ<i>d</i> and Vi<i>s</i>tâsp Vast taken together, the learning of which by heart (as the word ‘easy’ implies) is a very serious task, comparable with learning the whole Greek text of the four Gospels.

[^5]: (156:1) Perhaps ‘with’ is meant, but the word used is pavan.

[^6]: (156:2) See Chap. XLIV, 2.

[^7]: (157:1) The reason for this difference is that it is only necessary to learn the words of the Avesta, without understanding them, whereas a knowledge of the Zand, or commentary, implies understanding both texts as well as knowing the Avesta by heart.

[^8]: (157:2) M14 omits the repetition of the words mûn afzâr, but it seems necessary for the completion of the idiomatic phrase.

[^9]: (157:3) The six Gâsânbârs or Gâhambârs are festivals, each held for five days, and severally ending on the 45th, 205th, 180th, 210th, 290th, and 365th days of the Parsi year. They were probably p. 158 intended originally to celebrate the periods of midspring, midsummer, the beginning of autumn, the beginning of winter, midwinter, and the beginning of spring (see Sls. XVIII, 3), when the Parsi year was fixed to begin at the vernal equinox. In later times they were supposed to commemorate the creations of the sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, and man.

[^10]: (158:1) The meaning, seems to be that a priest once acknowledged as pre-eminent is not to lose his right of precedence merely because others become rather better qualified, so long as he himself does not retrograde, or is not superseded in his official duties. But if through any accidental circumstance he be excluded from the chief seat, he ought not to dispute the matter.

[^11]: (158:2) Or, perhaps, ‘through being moderate in his eating.’

[^12]: (159:1) The evil spirit.
