## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXXI.

1\. _As to_ the eightieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: What is the purpose of this _ceremony for_ the living soul [^3], _and_ why [^4] is it necessary <span id="p238"><sup><small>[ p. 238 ]</small></sup></span> to order _it?_ 2. And, whenever _one_ orders it, how is it necessary then to order it, how is it best when they celebrate _it_, and what is its great advantage _as_ a good work?

3\. The reply is this, that worship with the ceremonial _for_ those newly passed _away, during_ the three days which _they spend_ in the account [^1], is suitable for the discreet, just as the protection with nourishment of those newly born, in their infancy, is also much more suitable for the discreet. 4. He is a truly discreet man through whom _there_ is ceremonial for the three _days_, on account of his own father, and privileged wife, and infant child, _and_ well-behaved servant, on _their_ passing away; and it is indispensable to order the triple ceremonial of the three days.

5\. This, too, is said: where it is not possible to solemnize his three _days_, or they solemnize _them_ afterwards, when information _of the death_ arrives [^2], three days are to be solemnized as a substitute _for_ those three. 6. For the good work of the ceremonial which is ordered by him himself, or bequeathed by him, or is his _through_ consenting to it by design [^3], exists--even though it is thus possible that it will be conducted afterwards--whenever it comes into progress; therefore he is exalted for it at his account <span id="p239"><sup><small>[ p. 239 ]</small></sup></span> in the three _days_, and it comes on for his _being_ exalted. 7. When that which is conducted afterwards comes on for aiding _his being_ exalted in the three _days_ of the account, that which _was_ conducted by him himself beforehand is more hopeful _and_ more certain of being exalted in that position.

8\. On account of there being also a diminution (aîtŏ-<i>k</i> gahî<i>d</i>ârîh) of risk about their own souls, in the event of (min zak aîgh hat) their children not ordering the three _days' ceremonial_, or it not being possible to solemnize _it_ at that time, it is desirable to order, in their own lifetime and _at_ their own convenience, _the ceremony for_ their own living souls, advisedly, without doubt, and _having_ appointed the _mode of_ life of the three _days_, and also to appoint by will him who is to conduct _it_ in the end. 9. And when both are conducted, the increase of good works and exaltation, though the end is not possible, or is not proceeded _with_\--and the previous good works are commendable, and, therefore, preservatory--_has_ reached even unto the most lordly wishes.

10\. _As to_ the man _with_ great _and_ powerful children, to whom the ceremonial of the three _days_ for himself _at_ the final day, _and_ also the progress of many good works _have_ seemed certain, _but_ on account of yet another way to freedom from doubt effectually (frârâstîhâ) existing, he _has_ bequeathed the conduct of the three _days' ceremonial_, and also other good works, unto _his_ children, in order that _the ceremony for_ the living soul _may be_ conducted _at_ the final day, with him the angels are in triumph, the glory of the religion in the most lordly glory, _and_ the solemnizers of ceremonial worship are many. 11. Then, moreover, owing to the contest of the <span id="p240"><sup><small>[ p. 240 ]</small></sup></span> demons--so unjust that _on_ the day of his passing _away it_ is due to the uncleanness (apâ<i>d</i>yâ<i>v</i>îh) which _has_ attained unto _its full_ extent [^1]\--all the solemnizers _in_ the country, of the acts of worship solemnized, _may have_ become thoroughly doubtful of the worship, and until it goes on to the disciples, and the ceremony is prepared, it is not proper to perform the whole ceremonial; in that way is manifested the great advantage _and_ commendableness which _arises_ from that ceremony _for_ his living soul.

12\. The nature of _the ceremony_ ordered _for_ the living soul is a counterpart of the three _days_, so _it_ is needful that _at_ all times of the three days _and_ nights, successively emancipative (avadîgîni<i>s</i>nîk), a ceremonial _in honour_ of Srôsh [^2] _be_ always conducted, and _that_ it proceed; and a fire is lighted in the ceremonial, and the clean ligature of the limbs is to be tied. 13. As a rule it is so considered that [^3] in the three days _there_ are fifteen [^4] ceremonies (ya<i>s</i>tanŏ) _in honour_ of Srôsh, and three sacred cakes (drôn) [^5] which are consecrated in each dawn (bâm-<i>i</i>) with various dedications; and the fourth day they solemnize the Vispara<i>d</i> [^6], the portion [^7] of the righteous guardian spirits (ar<i>d</i>âî fravar<i>d</i>ŏ). 14. And there <span id="p241"><sup><small>[ p. 241 ]</small></sup></span> are fugitives of families of the period, _and_ other still further diminishers [^1] of good works, who _have_ wished to produce the wealth which is necessary to perform advantageously, as a custom of the soul in those three days, one _celebration_ of all the religious rites (hamâk dînô) _in honour_ of Srôsh, _and_ the consecration of three sacred cakes for Srôsh every day; and the third night, at dawn [^2], the consecration of a sacred cake _dedicated in_ three modes. 15. In accomplishing the _consecration of the_ sacred cake specially for the righteous guardian spirits, _on_ the fourth day, _one_ is supposed to order a Dvâ<i>z</i>dah-hômâst [^3] _in honour_ of the righteous guardian spirits, and the rest of the ceremonial.

16\. And _he_ who _has_ intended much more laudably is declared _as_ the more devout and more judicious of worshippers; and for the sake of the ceremonial he is cleansed by the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ [^4], _and_ is to practise other descriptions of cleanliness as regards _his_ body and clothing. 17. While in the performance of the ceremonial, bread _made_ from corn which is ground _by_ those of the good <span id="p242"><sup><small>[ p. 242 ]</small></sup></span> religion, wine from that made _by_ those of the good religion, _and_ meat from the animal [^1] which is slaughtered in the ceremonial are eaten; _and one_ is to proceed into the abode of fires [^2] and of the good, _and_ to abstain from the rest of the other places which are dubious [^3] _and_ food which is dubious. 18. And with that thorough heedfulness _one_ is to conduct and order that ceremonial in the abode of the ever-growing fire, or other fire of Varahrân [^4]; whereby his numerous good works are effectual, _and_ the path of good works [^5] is very broad. 19. Concerning [^6] the suffering of _him_ whose capability in that which is his preserving efficacy [^7] is less, it is thus revealed, that not he who is righteous is overwhelmed, as _it were_ unwilling, by incapability [^8].

## Footnotes

[^3]: (237:3) Dastûr Peshotanji Behramji, the high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay, informs me that every Parsi is bound to perform, or get performed, every year during his or her lifetime, ceremonies for three days in honour of his or her soul, analogous to those performed during the three days after a death These Zindah-ravân, or Srôsh, ceremonies are generally ordered on the first three Fravardîgân holidays, extending from the twenty-sixth to the twenty-eighth day of the last month of the Parsi year.

[^4]: (237:4) Reading maman râî, as in M14; K35 has lâ ‘not,’ instead of râî, ‘for.’

[^1]: (238:1) See Chaps. XXIV, XXV.

[^2]: (238:2) M14 has ‘or they do not solemnize _them_, after which the information arrives,’ which is clearly inconsistent with the context. When a person dies away from home, and the ceremonies are not performed on the spot, they must be performed at his home immediately after information of his death arrives, and the three succeeding days are considered as representing the three days after the death (see Sls. XVII, 6).

[^3]: (238:3) Comp. Chap. VIII, 5.

[^1]: (240:1) The corpse being considered utterly unclean.

[^2]: (240:2) See Chap. XIV, 4.

[^3]: (240:3) The following clause, about the three days, is omitted in M14, which skips from ‘that’ to ‘the fourth day.’

[^4]: (240:4) The Pers. Rivâyats merely say that four priests are employed, two at a time, so as to relieve each other in the continuous series of ceremonies for three days and nights.

[^5]: (240:5) See Chap. XXX, 1.

[^6]: (240:6) Here written Visparê<i>d</i>ŏ (see Chap. XLV, 6).

[^7]: (240:7) Reading bôn, instead of nûb; M14 omits the word.

[^1]: (241:1) M14 has ‘there are ghostly observers of the families of the period, _and_ many other teachers.’ But the original meaning was, no doubt as in K35, that there were many persons at that period who would have been glad to possess the means of ordering even a small portion of the proper rites for the dead.

[^2]: (241:2) That is, at dawn on the fourth day. The rites here mentioned seem to have been considered as the minimum that could be approved.

[^3]: (241:3) See Chap. XLVIII, 25.

[^4]: (241:4) A tedious ceremony of purification, lasting nine nights and detailed in Vend. IX, 1-145 (see App. IV). Its name is the Av. word which commences the instructions for sprinkling the unclean person (Vend. IX, 48), and means ‘the top’ of the head.

[^1]: (242:1) A goat or sheep is meant by gôspend here.

[^2]: (242:2) The fire temple, in, or near, which the priests (‘the good’) reside.

[^3]: (242:3) Or, var-hômand may mean ‘open to choice,’ but it is generally used as the opposite of aêvar, 'certain:

[^4]: (242:4) Sacred fire (see Chap. XXXI, 7).

[^5]: (242:5) Over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge (see Chap. XXI, 5).

[^6]: (242:6) Reading râî, instead of lâ, ‘not,’ here, and _vice versa_ further on in the sentence, as in M14.

[^7]: (242:7) That is, in good works. M14 omits the word ‘less.’

[^8]: (242:8) The construction of this quotation is suggestive of its being a literal translation from the Avesta.
