## EPISTLE II. TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER VIII.

1\. To arrange again for approval the other _matters, of_ which a portion is written _about_ by you, an epistle [^3] is again prepared in advance for Sîrkân, Shirâ<i>z</i>, _and_ other _places_, so as thus to make your decree a writing of bygone offence. 2. Because, if your despatch (firîst) prepared this new .proceeding, and you do not turn away _from_ it, _and_ do not recede through opposition _and_ accumulation of vexation, _and_ these others, too, like thee, shall <span id="p353"><sup><small>[ p. 353 ]</small></sup></span> not now abandon routine of that kind, then _your_ children, your own precious _ones_ who are beloved--_of_ whom I know that you make them love _you_, and do not, moreover, diminish in _your_ protection _of them_\--shall be your accusers; _and_ they shall abandon confidence _in_ me as refuge and guardian, _and_ in the sacred beings, through want of advice _and_ want of guardianship. 3. The fires of the sacred fires whose manager is a guard _and_ protection such as I, lest they _should_ not obtain such an officiating priest (zôtŏ), _will have_ in defence and guardianship of themselves to make back to _their_ Shirâ<i>z</i> abode. 4. And <i>I</i> myself _shall have_ to retire (agvira<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>anŏ) from the countries of Irân, _and_ to wander forth to far distant realms where I _shall_ not hear a rumour about your evil deeds. 5. In _my_ occupation, moreover, my fortune (sukûn) _may be_ to wander forth by water even to China, or by land even to Arûm [^1]; but _to be_ carried off by Vâê [^2], that uplifter, is much more my desire than when I am there where, owing to you, I hear that, as regards the glorifying of the sacred beings, which, because of my reply obtained above, _would_ then _be_ as much as death to me; _it would_ also be the ending of that internal strife, _so_ distasteful (aparvârakŏ) to me, which is like _his_ who _has_ to struggle with his own life.
