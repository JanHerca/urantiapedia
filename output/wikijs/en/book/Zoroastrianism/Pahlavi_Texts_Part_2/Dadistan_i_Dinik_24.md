## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. The twenty-third question is that which you ask thus: When he who is righteous passes away, where is the place the soul sits the first night, the second, and the third; and what does it do?

2\. The reply is this, that thus it is said, that the <span id="p54"><sup><small>[ p. 54 ]</small></sup></span> soul of man, itself the spirit of the body [^1], after passing away, is three nights upon earth, doubtful about its own position (gâs) [^2], and in fear of the account; and it experiences terror, distress (dahyakŏ), and fear through anxiety about the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge [^3]; and as it sits it notices about its own good works _and_ sin. 3. And the soul, which in a manner _belongs_ to _that_ same spirit of the body which is alike experiencing and alike touching it, becomes acquainted by sight with the sin which it _has_ committed, and the good works which it _has_ scantily done.

4\. And the first night from its own good thoughts, the second night from _its_ good words, and the third night from _its_ good deeds it obtains pleasure for the soul; and if also, with the righteousness, there be sin which remains _in it_ as its origin, the first punishment in retribution for the evil deed occurs _that_ same third night. 5. The same third night, on the fresh arrival of a dawn [^4], the treasurer of good works, like a handsome maiden (kanîkŏ) [^5], comes out to meet _it_ with the store of its own good works; and, collected by witches (parîkŏ-<i>k</i>ind), the sin and crime unatoned for (atôkhtŏ) come on to the account _and_ are justly accounted for [^6]. <span id="p55"><sup><small>[ p. 55 ]</small></sup></span> 6\. For the remaining (ketrûn<i>d</i>) sin it undergoes punishment _at_ the bridge, and the evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds are atoned for; and with the. good thoughts, good words, and good deeds of its own commendable and pleasing spirit it steps for-ward unto the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânô) [^7], or to heaven (vahi<i>s</i>tô), or to the ever-stationary (hamîstânagânŏ) of the righteous [^8], there where there is a place for it in righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (54:1) The ‘spirit of the body’ which is to some extent distinguished from the ‘soul,’ both in this chapter and the next, is probably the life, as described in Chap. XXIII, 7.

[^2]: (54:2) That is, its future position, or ‘destination.’

[^3]: (54:3) See Chap. XXI, 2-7

[^4]: (54:4) Reading dên bâm-i nuk ayâftŏ.

[^5]: (54:5) Fully described in Hn. II, 22-32, AV. IV, 18-35, Mkh. II, 125-139

[^6]: (54:6) The author is more practical than most other writers on the same subject, as he assumes that the righteous soul is not absolutely righteous, nor the wicked soul absolutely wicked.

[^7]: (55:1) See Chap. XX, 3.

[^8]: (55:2) There is another place for the ever-stationary of the wicked (see Chap. XXXIII, 2).
