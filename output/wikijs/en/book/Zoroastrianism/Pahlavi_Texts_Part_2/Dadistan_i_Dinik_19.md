## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XIX.

1\. The eighteenth question is that which you ask thus: When the souls of the righteous _and_ the souls of the wicked go out to the spirits, will it then be possible for them to see Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Aharman [^1], or not?

2\. The reply is this, that concerning Aharman it is said that his is no material existence (stîs); _and_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as a spirit among the spirits, is to be heard by those who are material and those also who are spiritual, _but his_ form (kerpô) is not completely visible except through wisdom. 3. And a semblance of _his_ power is seen, as _was_ told unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân when he saw the result (zah) of his handiwork, and he (Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>) spoke thus: 'Grasp the hand of a righteous man! for the kindly operation of my religion through [^2] thee thyself is as <span id="p45"><sup><small>[ p. 45 ]</small></sup></span> much as he shall grasp, and thou mayst see him whose reception (mâhmânîh) of my wisdom and glory is the most.

4\. And about the souls of the righteous and wicked, in the spiritual places they see the throne (gâs), which they deem a sight of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 5. And so also those who are domiciled with (hamnemân) Aharman, through that wisdom with reference to whose creator they shall suffer, will understand minutely as regards Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the nature of Aharman (Aharmanîh). 6. And he who is of the righteous is delighted at escaping from Aharman _and_ coming to the existence pertaining to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and they shall offer homage to the glory [^3] of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 7. And he who is wicked, through being deceived by Aharman, and turning from the direction (pe<i>l</i>ag) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, becomes more vexed _and_ more penitent; the hope (zahî<i>s</i>nŏ) and forgiveness which he possesses, and the retribution _and_ manacling which are his among the fiends _and_ spirits through his own handiwork, are _by_ the permission which comes from the most persistent of the persistent [^4] at the period of the resurrection.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (44:2) The evil spirit (see Chap. II, II), whose nature and powers differ very little from those ascribed to the devil by most Christian writers.

[^2]: (44:3) Or ‘on;’ or, perhaps, it ‘is as much as he shall grasp at thee thyself.’

[^3]: (45:1) The word ‘glory’ is always to be understood in its material sense of ‘radiance, effulgence.’

[^4]: (45:2) That is, from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. The epithet khvâpar, here translated ‘persistent,’ appears to mean ‘self-sustaining’ in the Avesta (see Sls. XXII, 21); traditionally it is supposed to mean ‘protecting, cherishing,’ but this is merely a guess, though it seems related to, Pers. khapârah, ‘active,’ and may, therefore, often mean ‘persevering.’
