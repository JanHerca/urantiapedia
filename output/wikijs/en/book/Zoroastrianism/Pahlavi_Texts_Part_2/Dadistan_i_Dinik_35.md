## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXXV.

1\. The thirty-fourth question is that which you ask thus: Does this world become quite without men [^1], so that _there_ is no bodily existence in _it_ whatever, <span id="p77"><sup><small>[ p. 77 ]</small></sup></span> and then shall they produce the resurrection, or how is it?

2\. The reply is this, that this world, continuously from _its_ immaturity even unto _its_ pure renovation, _has_ never been, and also _will_ not be, without men; and _in_ the evil spirit, the worthless (a<i>s</i>apîr), no stirring desire of this arises. 3. And near to the time of the renovation the bodily existences desist from eating, and live without food (pavan akhûri<i>s</i>nîh) [^2]; and the offspring who are born from them are those of an immortal, for they possess durable and blood-exhausted (khûn-girâî) bodies. 4. Such are _they_ who are the bodily-existing men that are in the world when there are men, passed _away_, who rise again and live again.
