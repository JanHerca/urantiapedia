## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXXVII.

1\. _As to_ the thirty-sixth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: How shall they produce the resurrection, how do they prepare the dead, and when the dead are prepared by them, how are they? 2. When it is produced by them, is an increase in the brilliance of the stars, moon, and sun necessary, _and_ does it arise, or not? are _there_ seas, rivers, _and_ mountains, or not? and is the world just as large as this, or does it become more _so_ and wider?

3\. The reply is this, that the preparation and production of the resurrection are an achievement _connected_ with miracle, a sublimity (rabâîh), and, afterwards, also a wondrous appearance unto the creatures who are uninformed. 4. The secrets and affairs of the persistent creator are like every mystery and secret; excepting himself--he who is _capable_ of all knowledge, the fully-informed, and all in all (vispânŏ vispô)--no one of the worldly beings and imperfect spirits _has_ known them.

5\. A true proverb (gôbi<i>s</i>nŏ-gô) of the intelligent _and_ worldly, which is obvious, is that as it is easier in teaching to teach again learning _already_ taught _and_ forgotten than that which _was_ untaught, and easier to repair again a well-built house, given gratuitously, than that _which_ is not _so_ given, so also the formation _again_ of that which _was_ formed is more excellent (hunîrtar), and the wonder is <span id="p81"><sup><small>[ p. 81 ]</small></sup></span> less, than the creation of creatures. 6. And through the wisdom and glory _of_ the omniscient and omnipotent creator, by whom the saddened (âlîkhtŏ) creatures _were_ created, that which _was_ to perish is produced again anew, _and that which was_ not to perish, except a little, is produced handsome even for a creation of the creator [^1].

7\. He who is a pure, spiritual creature is made unblemished; he, also, who is a worldly creature is immortal and undecaying, hungerless and thirstless, undistressed and painless; while, though he moves (<i>g</i>undê<i>d</i>ŏ) in a gloomy, evil existence, the fiend is rightly judging from _its_ arrangement (min nivâr<i>d</i>ŏ) _that it_ is not the place of a beneficent _being_, but the place of an existence _which_ is deadly, ignorant, deceiving, full of malice, seducing, destroying, causing disgrace; making unobservant (aûbêngar), and full of envy. 8. And his existence is so full of malice, deceit, seductiveness, unobservance, destructiveness, and destruction that _he has_ no voice except for accomplices (ham-bû<i>d</i>îkân) and antagonists, except also for his own _creatures and_ gossips when _their_ hearts are desirous of evil, seducing, destroying, making unobservant, causing malice, and bearing envy. 9. And _he_ is disclosed (vishâ<i>d</i>) from his own origin and abyss full of darkness, unto the limits of darkness _and_ confines of the luminaries; and in his terribleness and demoniacal deliberation he gazes at the unblemished light and creatures of the beneficent Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 10. And through abundant envy and complete maliciousness is his lying; and he mounts (sûbârê<i>d</i>ŏ) to seize, destroy, <span id="p82"><sup><small>[ p. 82 ]</small></sup></span> render unobservant, and cause to perish _these_ same well-formed creatures of the sacred beings. I1. And owing to his observance of falsehood he directed falsehood _and_ lies with avidity (varenô), which were necessary for obtaining his success in his own rendering _others_ unobservant (aûbênŏ); even in the nine thousand winters (hazangrôk zîm) [^2] of falsehood that which is disregarded therein is his own falsity.

12\. He who is the most lordly of the lords of the pre-eminent luminaries, and the most spiritual of spirits, and all _the beings_ of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the creator--who was himself capable of an effectual (tûbânŏ) gain for every scheme of his [^3]\--do not allow that fiend into the interior, into the radiance (farôgî<i>d</i>) of the luminaries. 13. And _they_ [^4] understood through _their_ own universal wisdom that fiend's thoughts [^5] of vileness, and _meditation_ of falsehood <span id="p83"><sup><small>[ p. 83 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ lies, and became aware _of them_ by themselves and through their own intuition, and shall not accept the perdition (aôshîh) of the fiend, _but_ are to be rightly listening to the commands of him [^6] who is worthy. 14. For his [^7] is not the nature of him who is good, _nor_ the wisdom of him who is propitious; and he does not turn from the confines of the shining ones, and the developments pertaining to those of the good _being_ [^8], until he arrives at the creatures; and he struggles in an attempt (aûzmânŏ), spreads forth into the sky, is mobbed (garôhagî-aît) in combats, is completely surrounded, _and_ is tested _with_ perfect appliances. 15: His resources, also, are destroyed, _his_ internal [^9] vigour is subdued, _his_ weapons of falsehood are disregarded, and _his_ means of deceiving shall perish; and with completeness of experience, thorough painfulness, routed troops, broken battle-array, and disarranged means he enjoys on the outside the radiance of the luminaries with the impotence (anaîyyâragîh) of a desire which again returns to him.

16\. And the same well-shining light of all kinds of the creator, when they shall not let in him who is Aharman, shall remain an unlimited time, _while_ the fiend is in household attendance on those of the frontier through not being let in, _and_ constantly troubled at the everlasting creatures. 17. The household attendance of the fiend seemed to it [^10] perpetually afflicting; and also the previous struggle <span id="p84"><sup><small>[ p. 84 ]</small></sup></span> of the fiend when the celestial spirit (ahvô) _pertaining_ to the luminaries _was_ not contended _with_ by him, _his_ defeat (makhîtûntanŏ) when the luminaries _were_ not defeated by him, _his_ infliction of punishment before sin, and _his_ causing hatred before hatred _exists_ are all recounted by it to the justice and judiciousness whose unchangeableness, will, persistence, and freedom from hatred--which is the character of its faithful ones--are not so [^11], to him who is the primeval (pê<i>s</i>akŏ) creator.

18\. The fiend, after _his_ falsity, the struggle--on account of the fighting of the shining ones _and_ the decreed keeping _him_ away which _was_ due to the fighter for the luminaries--_and_ the ill-success of the struggle of himself and army, ordered the beating back of the worthy fighter _against_ destruction, the malicious avenging again of the causer of hatred, _and_ the destroyer's internal vileness and disorganisation anew of his own place. 19. He saw the beneficent actions by which, through the wisdom of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the spiritual wisdom [^12], within the allotted (burîn-hômônd) time, the limited space, the restricted conflict, the moderate trouble, _and_ the definite (far<i>g</i>âm-hômand) labour _existing_, struggles against the fiend, who is the unlawful establisher _of_ the wizard; and he returned inside to fall disarmed (asâmânŏ) _and_ alive, _and_ until he shall be fully tormented (pûr-dar<i>d</i>ag-hâe) and shall be thoroughly experienced, they shall not [^13] let _him_ out again in the allotted time that the fiend ordered _for_ the success of falsehood _and_ lies. 20. <span id="p85"><sup><small>[ p. 85 ]</small></sup></span> And the same fiend _and_ the primeval (kâdmôn) demons are cast out confusedly, irreverently, sorrowfully, disconcertedly, fully afflicting _their_ friends, thoroughly experienced, even with their falsehoods and not inordinate means [^14], with lengthy slumbers, with broken-down (a<i>v</i>asîst) deceits and dissipated resources, confounded and impotent, into the perdition of Aharman, the disappearance of the fiend, the annihilation of the demons, and the non-existence of antagonism.

21\. To make the good creatures again fresh and pure, _and_ to keep _them_ constant and forward in pure and virtuous conduct is to render them immortal; and the not letting in of the co-existent _one_ [^15], owing to the many new assaults (pa<i>d</i><i>g</i>astŏîh) that _occur_ in his perpetual household attendance [^16] of falsity--through which _there_ would have been a constant terror of light for the creatures of the sacred beings--is to maintain a greater advantage. 22. And his (Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s) means are not the not letting in _of the fiend_, but the triumph arranged for him_self_ in the end--the endless [^17], unlimited light _being_ also produced by him, and the constantly-beneficial space [^18] <span id="p86"><sup><small>[ p. 86 ]</small></sup></span> that is self-sustained--which (triumph) is the resource of all natures, races, characters, powers, _and_ duties from the beginning and maturing of those of the good religion and the rushing of the liar and destroyer on to the creatures, which are requisite _for_ the final, legitimate triumph of the well-directing creator, and _for_ the termination of the struggles of all by the protection and recompense of the praises and propitiation performed, which are the healing of the righteous _and_ the restoration of the wicked _at_ the renovation. 23. Even these developments, even these established habits (da<i>d</i>\-<i>s</i>ânîhâ), even these emissions of strength, even these births, even these races, even these townspeople (dihîkŏîhâ), even these characters, even these sciences [^19], even these manageable and managing ones [^20], and even these other, many, special species and manners which at various periods (anbânŏ) of time are in the hope that the quantity and nature of their auxiliaries _may be_ complete, and their coming accomplished and not deficient in success (vakhtŏ), are distributed and made happy by him.

24\. The sky is in three thirds, of which the one at the top is joined to the endless light, in which is the constantly-beneficial space; the one at the <span id="p87"><sup><small>[ p. 87 ]</small></sup></span> bottom reached to the gloomy abyss, in which is the fiend full of evil; and one is between those two thirds _which are_ below and above. 25. And the uppermost third, _which_ is called ‘the rampart of the supreme heaven’ (garô<i>d</i>mânô drupû<i>s</i>tŏ) [^21], _was_ made by him with purity, all splendour, and every pleasure, and no access to it for the fiend. 26. And he provided that third for undisturbedly convoking the pure, the archangels, _and_ the righteous _that have_ offered praises who, as _it were_ unarmed (azenâvar), struggle unprepared and thoroughly in contest _with_ the champions of the co-existent _one_, and they smite the co-existent _one_ and his own progeny (gôhârakŏ) _already_ described, and afford support to the imperishable state [^22], through the help of the archangels and the glory of the creator. 27. And, again also, in their [^23] fearlessness they seek for the destruction of the demons and for the perfection of the creatures of the good _beings_; as _one_ who is fearless, owing to some rampart which is inaccessible _to_ arrows and blows, and shoots arrows at the expanse below, is troubled (bakhsê<i>d</i>ŏ) for friends below.

28\. And he made a distinction in the prescribed splendour and glory for the lowermost third of the sky; and the difference is _that_ it is liable to injury (pavan resh), so that the fiend, who is void of goodness, comes _and_ makes that third full of darkness and full of demons, _and_ shall be able to perplex in that difficulty when the thousand winters occur, and the five detested (lakhsî<i>d</i>akŏ) kinds of the <span id="p88"><sup><small>[ p. 88 ]</small></sup></span> demons of life [^24] have also overwhelmed with sin those of the wicked who are deceived by the demons and _have_ fled from the contest. 29. _But_ they shall not let the fiend fully in, owing to the luminaries of the resplendent _one_, during the allotted time when the demons' punishing and the repentance of the wicked are accomplished.

30\. And he appointed for the middle third the creatures of the world separated [^25] from, the world and the spiritual _existence_; and among those creatures [^26] _were_ produced for them the managing man as a guardian of the creatures, and the deciding wisdom _as_ an appliance of man; _and_ the true religion, the best of knowledge _was_ prepared by him. 31. And that third is for the place of combat and the contest of the two different natures [^27]; and in the uppermost part of the same third is stationed by him the light _of_ the brilliant sun and moon and glorious stars, and _they_ are provided by him that they may watch [^28] the coming of the adversary, and revolve around the creatures. 32. All the _sacred_ ceremonies of the distant earth (bûm), the light, the abundant rains, and the good angels vanquish <span id="p89"><sup><small>[ p. 89 ]</small></sup></span> and smite the wizards _and_ witches who rush _about_ below them [^29], _and_ struggle to perplex by injury to the creatures; they make all such assailants become fugitives [^30]. 33. And through their revolution the ascents and descents, the increase and diminution (narafsi<i>s</i>nŏ), of the creatures [^31] shall occur, the flow and ebb of the seas, and the increase of the dye-like [^32] blood of the inferior creatures [^33]; also owing to them _and_ through _them have_ elapsed the divisions of the days, nights, months, years, periods, _and_ all the millenniums (hazagrôk zîmân) of time.

34\. He also appointed unto _our fore_fathers the equipment which is their own, a material vesture, a sturdy bravery, and the guardian spirits of the righteous; and he provided that they _should_ remain _at_ various times in their own nature [^34], and come into worldly vesture. 35. And those for great hosts _and_ many slaves are born, for the duties of the period, into _some_ tribe; he who has plenty of offspring is like Fravâk [^35], he who is of the early law <span id="p90"><sup><small>[ p. 90 ]</small></sup></span> (pê<i>s</i>dâ<i>d</i>ŏ) like Hôshâng [^36], he who is a smiter of the demon like Tâkhmôrup [^37], he who is full of glory like Yim [^38], he who is full of healing like Frê<i>d</i>ûn, he who has both wisdoms [^39] like the righteous Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^40], he who is full of strength like Keresâsp [^41], he who is of a glorious race like Kai-Kavâ<i>d</i> [^42], he who is full of wisdom like Aôshânar [^43]. 36. He who is noble is like Sîyâvash [^44], he who is an eminent doer (a<i>v</i>arkâr) like Kaî-Khûsrôî [^45], he who is exalted like Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^46], he who is completely good like the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^47], he who arranges the world like Peshyôtanû [^48], he who is over the religion (dînô-a<i>v</i>arag) <span id="p91"><sup><small>[ p. 91 ]</small></sup></span> like Atû<i>r</i>ŏ-pâ<i>d</i> [^49], he who is liturgical like Hûshê<i>d</i>ar [^50], he who is legal like Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, and he who is metrical and concluding like Sôshâns. 37. Among them are many illustrious ones, glorious doers, supporters of the religion, and good managers, who are completely (âpûr) for the smiting of the fiend and the will of the creator.

38\. He also produced the creatures as contenders, and granted assistance (vê<i>d</i>varih), through the great, in the struggle for the perfect happiness from heaven at the renovation [^51] _of the universe_; and he made _them_ universally (vâspôharakânîhâ) contented. 39. A vitiated thought of a living, well-disposed _being_ is a stumble (ni<i>s</i>î<i>v</i>ŏ) which is owing to evil; and these are even those [^52] contented with death, because they know their limit, _and_ it shall be definite (burînŏ-hômônd) and terminable; the evil of the world, in life, is definite, and they shall not make _one_ exist unlimitedly _and_ indefinitely in the evil of the world, through an eternal life with pain.

40\. And through a great mystery, wholly miraculous, he produced a durable immortality for the living a perplexity so long as the best and utmost of it is such an immortality of adversity, for _it_ is <span id="p92"><sup><small>[ p. 92 ]</small></sup></span> ever living molested and eternally suffering. 41. And their development, the strength of lineage obtained, is ever young in succession, and the tender, well-destined _ones_, who are good, are in adversity and perpetuity of life, so that there is a succession of life through their own well-destined offspring [^53]. 42. They become eternally famous, so that they obtain, every one, an old age which is renewed, _free_ from sickness and decay, visibly in their own offspring and family (gôharakŏ) whenever they become complete; and any one of the combative, whose struggle is through the smiting that his fellow-combatant obtains, is of a comfortable disposition at the balance [^54]. 43. This _one_, too, is for stepping forth to heaven, even as that pre-eminent _one_ of the righteous, the greatest of the apostles and the most fortunate of those born, the chief of worldly beings, the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân, when the omniscient wisdom, _as_ a trance (gîp), came upon him from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and he saw him who _was_ immortal _and_ childless, and also him _who was_ mortal _and provided_ with children that perpetual life of the childless then seemed to him terrible, and that succession of mortals _seemed_ commendable [^55]; so that <span id="p93"><sup><small>[ p. 93 ]</small></sup></span> the coming of _his_ assured offspring [^56], Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, _and_ Sôshâns [^57], became more longed for and more desired, _and_ death _more_ than the perpetual life of his own body.

44\. And when he [^58] who is all-watchful and all-knowing had arranged the means of opposing the fiend, _there_ came for destroying, like a general leader (vispvar), that fiend of deceiving nature, the harassing, rushing, evil-wishing, primeval (pê<i>s</i>) contender, _together_ with the demons Akômanô (‘evil thought’) [^59], Aêshm (‘wrath’), Zarmân (‘decrepitude’), Bûshasp (‘lethargy’), craving distress, bygone luck [^60], Vâê [^61], Varenô (‘lust’) [^62], Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> [^63], and Vîzarâsh [^64], and the original, innumerable demons and fiends of Mâzendarân [^65]. 45. And his darkness _and_ gloom, scorpions (kadzûnŏ), porcupines, and vermin, poison <span id="p94"><sup><small>[ p. 94 ]</small></sup></span> and venom, and the mischief originally in the lower-most third of the sky [^66], issue upwards, astute in evil, into the middle third, in which are the agreeable [^67] creatures which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> created.

46\. And he smote the ox [^68], he made Gâyômar<i>d</i> mortal, and he shook the earth; and the land was shattered, creation became dark, and the demons rushed below, above, and on all sides, and they mounted even to the uppermost third of the sky [^69]. 47. And there the barricade (band) and rampart fortifying (vakhshîkŏ) the spiritual world is approached, for which the safeguard (nigâs) of all barricades [^70], that is itself the great glory of the pure religion, solving doubts--which is the safeguard of all barricades--is arrayed. 48. And the splendid, belt-bearing Pleiades [^71], like the star-studded girdle of the spirit-fashioned, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, are so arrayed as luminaries of the fully-glorious ones. 49. And there was no possibility (aîtŏkîh) of any demon or fiend, nor yet even of <span id="p95"><sup><small>[ p. 95 ]</small></sup></span> the demon of demons, the mightiest (mazvantûm) in valour, rushing up across that boundary; they are beaten back now, when _they have_ not reached _it_ from the gloom, at once _and_ finally (yak-vayô akha<i>r</i>).

50\. And the fiend _of_ gloomy race, accustomed to destruction (aôsh-âyin), changed into causes of death the position (gâs) of the brilliant, supreme heaven of the pure, heavenly angels--which he ordained through the power _of_ [^72] Mîtôkht (‘falsehood’)--and the triumph of the glory of the world‘s creatures, _as ordained_ through two decrees (zîkŏ):--one, the destruction of the living by the power [^73] of death; and one causing the manacling of souls by a course of wickedness. 51. And he made _as_ leaders therein that _one_ astute in evil who is _already_ named [^74], and Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> [^75] _who_ is explained _as_ ’the disintegration of material beings;‘ he also intrusted the demon Bûshasp (’lethargy‘) [^75] with the weakening of the breath, the demon Tap (’fever‘) [^76] with stupefying and disordering the understanding, and the demon Â<i>z</i> ( greediness’) [^77] with suggesting cravings and causing drinking before _having_ the thirst of a dog [^78]. 52. Also the demon Zarmân (decrepitude‘) [^79] for injuring the body and abstracting <span id="p96"><sup><small>[ p. 96 ]</small></sup></span> the strength; the bad Vâê’s tearing away the life by stupefying the body; the demon Aêshm e wrath‘) for occasioning trouble by contests, and causing an increase of slaughter; the noxious creatures of gloomy places for producing stinging and causing injury; the demon Zâîrî<i>k</i> [^80] for poisoning eatables and producing causes of death; with Nîyâ<i>z</i> (’want‘) [^81] the stealthily-moving and dreading the light [^82], the fearfulness of Nihîv terror’) chilling the warmth, and many injurious powers and demons of the destroyers were made by him constant assist-ants of Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> in causing death.

53\. Also, for rendering wicked _and_ making _fit_ for hell those whose souls are under the sway of [^83] falsehood (kadbâ), which in religious language is called Mîtôkht--since it is said in revelation that that is as much an evil as all the demons with the demons of demons--there is Akômanô (evil thought‘) [^84], who is with the evil spirit owing to the speaking of Mîtôkht (’falsehood') [^85]. 54. And for his doctrine (dinôîh) of falsehood, and winning the creatures, slander the deceiver, lust the selfish, hatred, and envy, besides the overpowering progress of disgrace (nang), the improper desires of the creatures, indolence in seeking wisdom, quarrelling about that <span id="p97"><sup><small>[ p. 97 ]</small></sup></span> which is no indication of learning, disputing (sitô<i>g</i>) about the nature of a righteous _one_, and many other seductive powers _and_ demons helping to win, _were_ made auxiliary to the doctrine of falsehood in deceiving the creatures.

55\. Also, to turn his disturbance [^86] to creatures of even other kinds, _there_ are demons _and_ fiends of further descriptions (freh-aîtân); and for the assistance of those combatants he established also _those_ afflictions (nîvakân) of many, the witches of natures for gloomy _places_, whose vesture is the radiance of the lights [^87] that fall, _and_ rush, and turn below the luminaries which have to soar (vâ<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîkânŏ) in stopping the way of _any_ little concealment of the spirits _and_ worldly _beings_ [^88]. 56. And they (the witches) overspread the light and glory of those _luminaries_, of whose bestowal of glory and their own diminution _of it_, moreover, for seizing the creatures, consist the pain, death, and original evil of the abode for the demon of demons [^89].

57\. And those demons _and_ original fiends, who are the heads and mighty _ones_ of the demons, injudiciously, prematurely moving, prematurely speaking, not for their own disciplined advantage, <span id="p98"><sup><small>[ p. 98 ]</small></sup></span> but with unbecoming hatred, lawless manner [^90], envy, _and_ spears exposing the body [^91], undesirably struggle together--a perplexing contention of troublers--about the destruction of the luminaries. 58. The army of angels, judiciously and leisurely fighting for the good creatures of the sacred beings, not with premature hatred and forward spears (pê<i>s</i>\-nîzahîh), but by keeping harm away _from_ themselves--the champions' customary mode [^92] of wounding--valiantly, strongly, properly, and completely triumphantly struggle _for_ a victory triumphantly fought. 59. For Aharman the demons are procurers (vashîkânŏ) of success _in_ the contests till the end, when the fiend becomes invisible _and_ the creatures become pure.

60\. Since worldly _beings_ observe, explain, _and_ declare among worldly _beings_ the work of the spirits and knowledge of customs (rîstakŏ),by true observation, through wisdom, _that_ that life (zîk) is proper when _it is_ in the similitude of the true power of wisdom, _and_ the visible life is undiscerning of that which is to come _and_ that which is provided, so also the evidence of a knowledge of the end of the contention is certain _and_ clearly visible. 61. And tokens are discernible and signs apparent which, to the wisdom of the ancients--if it extended, indeed, to a knowledge about this pre-eminent subject--_were_ hidden by the fiends, who are concealers _of them_ from the perception (hâ<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) of worldly _beings_, and also from _their_ coming to the perception of worldly _beings_. <span id="p99"><sup><small>[ p. 99 ]</small></sup></span> 62\. The learned high-priests who _were_ founders (pâyînkânŏ) _of the religion_ knew _it_ (_the evidence_), and those portions of it _were_ transmitted by them to the ancients which the successive realisers of it, for the ages before me (levînam), _have_ possessed. 63. The deceivers [^93] of the transmitters, who have existed _at_ various times, even among those who are blessed [^94], _have_ remained a mass of knowledge for me, by _being_ my reminder of the mature _and_ proper duty of those truly wise (hû-<i>k</i>îragânîkŏ), through the directions issuable by even worldly decision, and of so many of which I have a remembrance [^95], for the writing of which _there would be_ no end. 64. Then the manifest power of the fiend among us below, and the way provided by the creator for _his_ becoming invisible _and his_ impotence are clear; so also the full power of the creator of the army of angels, assuredly the procurers of success _in_ the end, and [^96] the accomplishment all-powerfully--which is his own advantage--of the completely-happy progress, for ever, of all creations which are his creatures, are thereby visible _and_ manifest; _and_ many tokens and signs _thereof_ are manifestly clear.

65\. One is this, that the creator is _in_ his own predestined (bagdâ<i>d</i>akŏ) abode, and the fiend is <span id="p100"><sup><small>[ p. 100 ]</small></sup></span> advancing _and has_ rushed in, and his advancing is for the subjugation of the creation [^97].

66\. One, that the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> are spiritual _and_ also worldly, and that is no world of the fiend, but he gathers an evil spiritual state into the world; _and_ as among so many the greed of success is only in one [^98], so the triumph is manifest of the good spirits _and_ worldly beings over the evil spirits.

67\. One is this, that _his_ defeat in the end is manifest from his contention and aggression (pê<i>s</i>za<i>d</i>ârîh); for the fiend is an aggressor _in_ an unlawful struggle; and leaving the army of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>\--subsequently the lawful defender (lakhvârza<i>d</i>âr)--the fiend of violence is a cause of power among those wholly unrequiting the creator _in_ the world [^99]. 68. If, also, every time that he smites the creatures he is equally _and_ lawfully beaten once again, it is assuredly evident therefrom that, when their beating _and_ being beaten are _on_ an equality together, _at_ first he whose hand _was_ foremost _was_ the smiter, and the backward fighter was beaten; _but at_ last that backward fighter is the smiter, and the foremost fighter becomes beaten [^100]; for when he is <span id="p101"><sup><small>[ p. 101 ]</small></sup></span> beaten _in_ the former combat, _there_ is then a combat again, and his enemy is beaten.

69\. One is this, that when the supply of weapons [^101], the fighting, and the ability of the contenders are equal, the supply of weapons of him who is the beginner (pê<i>s</i>î<i>d</i>âr) has always sooner disappeared, and, _at_ last, he is unarmed and his opponent re-mains armed; _and_ an armed _man_ is known _to be_ [^102] victorious over him _who is_ unarmed, just as _one_ fighting is triumphant over _one_ not fighting [^103]. 70. And a similitude of it, which is _derived_ from the world, is even such as when each ogle of two furious _ones_ (âr<i>d</i>ŏ) of equal strength, in a fight together, has an arrow, and each one is in fear of the other's possession of an arrow; _and_ one of them alone shoots _his_ arrow, and makes _it_ reach _his_ opponent; then he is without an arrow, and his opponent, fully mindful _of it_, has an arrow, and becomes fearless through possession of the arrow, his own intrepidity, _and_ the lack of arrows and complete terror of that earlier shooter. 71. And as regards mighty deeds he is successful; _and_ though _there be_ as much strength for the earlier fighter a successful termination is undiscoverable _for him_; despoiled of possession _by_ him who is later, _and_ ruined in that which is all-powerful, _his_ end _and_ disappearance are undoubted, clear, _and_ manifest [^104]. <span id="p102"><sup><small>[ p. 102 ]</small></sup></span> 72\. One is this, that owing to the previous non-appearance of the fiend, the coming forward of sickness and death unto the creatures of the sacred beings _occurred_ when the fiend rushed _in_, and he rendered the existence of men sickly; he also destroyed _and_ put to death the progeny of animals. 73. Afterwards, through lawfully driving _him_ away, sickness and death _come_ in turn (bârîkîhâ) unto the demons, _and_ the healthiness [^105] of the righteous _and_ perfect life unto the creatures of the sacred beings, as its counterpart is the great healthiness _which_ comes, more rightly rising, unto the creatures advised by the sacred beings, through united arrangement [^106]. 74. And, in the end, a worldly similitude of the sickness and grievous, complete death for the fiends [^107], and of the healthiness _and_ intrinsic (benaf<i>s</i>man-<i>k</i>îgûnîh) life for the creatures of the sacred beings, is that which _occurs_ when one of two litigants (ham-patkâr), prematurely revengeful, gives to _his_ fellow-litigant an irritating poison, _and_ himself eats wholesome flour before the later litigant gives a poison, as an antidote, to the earlier litigant, _and_ himself eats the poison-subduing flour; after which he is cured _by_ the poison, and his enemy is dead through the poison of the later flour [^108]. <span id="p103"><sup><small>[ p. 103 ]</small></sup></span> 75\. One is this, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the creator, is a manager with omniscient wisdom, _and_ the contention of the fiend of scornful looks (tar nigîri<i>s</i>n) is through lust of defilement; of united power is the management of that creator, as existing with (hamzîk) [^109] all the vigilance in the wisdom which is in everything; and that united power is the strength of the management of heaven. 76. And of much power is the contention of the fiend, as _his_ manifold changing of will--which is hostile to the will of even his own creatures, and is through the weakness and exhausted [^110] strength of an evil nature--is the contending power which forms his visible strength [^111].

77\. One is this, that is, on account of the fiend‘s contending ill-advisedly, however strongly the contest is adapted for the damage of his own fiendishness, and regret and bad consequences therefrom are perceptible. 78. Such as the very paralyzing [^112] affliction which _was_ appointed (nîhâ<i>d</i>ŏ) by him <span id="p104"><sup><small>[ p. 104 ]</small></sup></span> for the creatures of the world in putting the living to death, which he ordered with violence and the hope that it _would_ be _his_ greatest triumph. 79. Even that is what is so self-damaging to the same fiend that, when he puts to death him who is wicked, and he who is wicked, who is performing what is desirable for him (the fiend)--that performance of what is desirable _being_ the practice of sin--is useless _and_ goes thither where he is penitent of that seduction, the spirit [^113] of the owner (shah) of the sin, whose soul is wicked [^114], is righteous, in whose worldly body exist the fetters of pain and darkness; and owing to the unfettering of _its_ hands _from_ that pain it (the spirit) is far _away_, and goes to heaven, which is the most fortified of fortresses. 80. Fearlessly it fights for it, even as the guardian spirit of Yim the splendid [^115] kept away all trouble (vê<i>s</i>am), the guardian spirit of Frê<i>d</i>ûn kept away even those active in vexing [^116], _and_ other guardian spirits of those passed away are enumerated as _engaged_ in the defeat of many fiends. <span id="p105"><sup><small>[ p. 105 ]</small></sup></span> 81\. One is this, that the most grievous severance that is owing to him (the fiend) [^117] is the production of the mortality of the creatures, in which the afflicting (nîzgûn), demon Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> [^118] is the head _of_ the many Mâzînîkân _demons_ [^119]. 82. And the propitious creator’s developers _were_ thus unprovoked (anârgônd) when the only person, who is called Gâyômar<i>d</i> [^120], _was_ destroyed by him, and came back to the world _as_ a man and a woman whose names were Marhayâ _and_ Marhîyôih [^121]; and the propagation and connection of races _were_ through their next-of-kin marriage of a sister [^122]. 83. The unlucky [^123] fiend, while he <span id="p106"><sup><small>[ p. 106 ]</small></sup></span> increased offspring and fortune for them through death, so uplifted _his_ voice in _their_ presence, about the death of the living _ones_ of their offspring and lineage; that _together_ with the unmeasured destructiveness of the deadly evil spirit, and the unjust contention of his through death and the conveyer of death [^124], the sting also of birth _was_ owing to death. 84. The repetitions of the cry _were_ many, so that the issue (bâr) of thousands and thousands _of_ myriads from those two persons, and the multitude passed _away_, from a number _which_ is limited and a counterpart (aê<i>d</i>ûnŏîh) of the living people in the world, are apparent; and for the annihilation of many fiends, through death, the propitiousness of the contending power of the creator is clear _and_ manifest.

85\. One is this, that the most steadfast quality of the demon himself is darkness, the evil of which is so complete that they shall call the demons also those of a gloomy race. 86. _But_ such is the power in the arms _and_ resources of the angels, that even the first gloomy darkness in. the world is perpetually subdued by the one power really originating with the sun _and_ suitable _thereto, and_ the world is illuminated [^125].

87\. One is this, that the most mischievous weapon of the demons is the habit of self-deception which, <span id="p107"><sup><small>[ p. 107 ]</small></sup></span> on account of rendering the soul wicked thereby, seemed to them as the greatest triumph for themselves, _and_ a complete disaster for the angels. 88. In the great glory of the pure, true religion of the sacred beings is as much strength as is adapted to the full power of the lawlessness and much opposition of falsehood, _and_ also to the fully accurate (arsî<i>d</i>ŏ) speaking which is in itself an evidence of the true speaking of every proper truth and no truth whatever is perverted by it. 89. And the false sayings are many, and good sayings--_their_ opponents through good statement--do not escape from their imperfect truth [^126]; since a similitude of them is that which _occurs_ when, concerning that which is white-coloured, the whole of the truthful speak about _its_ white colour, _but as to_ the liars there are _some_ who _speak of_ its black colour, some of _its_ mud colour, some of _its_ blue colour, some of _its_ bran [^127] colour, some of _its_ red colour, and some of _its_ yellow colour. 90. And every single statement of each of the truthful is as much evidence, about those several colours of those who are liars, as even the compiled sayings of the Abraham of the Christians [^128], which are the word of _him_ who is also called their Messiah [^129], about the <span id="p108"><sup><small>[ p. 108 ]</small></sup></span> Son of the _Supreme_ Being [^130]; thus, they recount that the Son, who is not less than the Father, is himself He, the Being whom they consider undying. 91. One falsehood they tell about the same Messiah is that he died, and one falsehood they tell is that he did not die; it is a falsehood for those who say he did not die, _and_ for those who say he did die; wherefore did he not die, when _he is_ not dead? _and_ wherefore is it said he did not die, when he is mentioned as dead [^131]? 92. Even the compilation itself is an opponent to its own words, for, though it said _he_ is dead, it spoke unto _one_ not dead; and though _he_ is not dead, it spoke unto _one_ dead. 93. The proper office (gâs) of a compiler and mutilator [^132]\--through whose complete attainments the demons of like power as to the force of truth are strengthened, _and_ the pure, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers is itself dissipated and rendered useless for itself--is a habit (dâ<i>d</i>ŏ) growing with <span id="p109"><sup><small>[ p. 109 ]</small></sup></span> the fiend; and, as he is seen _to be_ victorious who overturns reliance on changeableness and similar powers, the final disruption of forces is a disruption of peculiarities (khû<i>d</i>îh vishôpi<i>s</i>nŏ) [^133].

94: One is this, that is, even that prodigious devastation _of_ which it is declared that it happens through the rain of Malkôs [^134], when, through snow, immoderate cold, _and_ the unproductiveness of the world, most mortals die; _and_ even the _things_ attainable by mortals are _attended_ with threatenings of scarcity. 95. Afterwards--_as_ among the all-wise, preconcerted remedies (pê<i>s</i> <i>k</i>ârîh) of the beneficent spirit [^135] such a remedy _was_ established (and nihâ<i>d</i> <i>k</i>âr) that _there is_ one of the species of lands, that is called 'the enclosure formed by <span id="p110"><sup><small>[ p. 110 ]</small></sup></span> Yim [^136],' through which, by orders issued by Yim the splendid _and_ rich in flocks, the son of Vîvangha [^137], the world is again filled--men of the best races, animals of good breeds, the loftiest trees, _and_ most savoury (khare<i>g</i>istânŏ) foods, _in_ that manner came back miraculously _for_ the restoration of the world; which new men are _substituted_ for the former created beings, which is an upraising of the dead [^138]. 96. Likewise from that miracle is manifested the non-attainment of the evil spirit to the universal control of the glory of the creator for every purpose.

97\. One is this, that--when the heterodox (dû<i>s</i>dînô) Dahâk [^139], on whom most powerful demons and fiends in the shape of serpents are winged [^140], escapes from the fetters of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, and, through witchcraft, remains a demon even to the demons [^141] _and_  <span id="p111"><sup><small>[ p. 111 ]</small></sup></span> a destroyer--a mighty man _who_ is roused [^142] up beforehand from the dead, _and_ is called Keresâsp the Sâmân [^143], crushes that fiendishness with a club _consisting_ of a cypress tree, _and_ brings that Dahâk through wholesome fear to the just law of the sacred beings [^144].

98\. One is this, that these, which are _distinct_ from those born _and_ the men who have laboured together, Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> [^145] _has_ not obtained, nor even _will_ obtain, for death; and through the power of immortals, and the action of the good discourses (hû-sakhunagânîh) [^146], they urge on to the sacred beings _those_ who are inquiring (kâv-hômand), even to the immortality which is the renovation of the other creatures. 99. One, _which is_ where the mingled conflict of the meeting _of good and evil occurs_ [^147], is the glorious good-yielding _one_ of the creator which is guarded by purity, so that the fiend _has_ not attained to injuring _it_, since it is pronounced _to be_ the uninjured ox which is called Hadhayã<i>s</i> [^148]. 100. Also the long life which <span id="p112"><sup><small>[ p. 112 ]</small></sup></span> is through its all-controlling power [^149] until they cause the end to occur, and the devourers of fires are subdued by it--_besides_ the whole strength of the unboasting (a<i>k</i>ûm) creatures of the beneficent spirit, after they live even without eating [^150]\--is because of the Hôm that is white [^151] and the promoter (frâshm) of perfect glory, which possesses the wholesomeness of the elixir of immortality, and through it the living become ever-living. 101. And also as many more specially pure glorious _ones_ whose enumeration _would_ be tedious [^152].

102\. One is this, that the struggle of the evil _one_ and the demons _with_ the creatures is not precisely the existence of _various_ kinds of contest, but <span id="p113"><sup><small>[ p. 113 ]</small></sup></span> by natural operation and through desire of deceit [^153]. 103. And the demon of slander (spazg), whose nature it is to make the indignation (zôhar) of the creatures pour out, one upon the other, about nothing, as he does not succeed in making _it_ pour out among the righteous [^154], he makes the wicked even pour _it_ out upon the wicked; _and_ as he does not succeed even in making _it_ pour out among the wicked, he makes a demon pour _it_ out upon a demon. 104. The impetuous assailant, Wrath (Aeshm), as he does not succeed in causing strife _among_ the righteous, flings discord _and_ strife amid the wicked; _and_ when he does not succeed _as_ to the strife even of the wicked, he makes the demons _and_ fiends fight together. 105. So also the demon of greediness (â<i>z</i>ŏ), when he does not attain, in devouring, to that of the good, mounts [^155] by his own nature unto devouring that of the demons. 106. So also the deadly Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> [^156] is ever an antagonistic operator; when _there_ is no righteous _one_ who is mortal, nor any creatures in the world, the wicked dying _one_ (mîrâk) rides to the fiends through a death which is an antagonism of himself [^157]. <span id="p114"><sup><small>[ p. 114 ]</small></sup></span> 107\. The means of the united forces [^158] are means such as the wise and the high-priests _have_ proclaimed, that is, at the time of the renovation _of the universe_ [^159] _being_ nigh, when completion _has_ come to generation--those who _were_ provided _being_ born--and after they occasion freedom from generation (azerkhûni<i>s</i>nîh), they cause men _and_ animals to exist, though passed _away and_ dead. 108. All men, righteous and wicked, who continue in the world _become_ immortal, the men are righteous whom Astôvîdâ<i>d</i> does not obtain for death by evil noosing (dû<i>s</i>\-vadi<i>s</i>nŏ) [^160] from behind, and _who have_ completely attained to the rules of the sacred beings (yang-î ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân); _and_ the soul of the wicked, which is repentant of deceit, turns back upon the demons and fiends themselves all that previous violence of destruction and perversion, contention and blinding [^161] which is natural to a demon, and they fight, and strike, and tear, and cause to tear, and destroy among themselves (benaf<i>s</i>man va<i>l</i>  <span id="p115"><sup><small>[ p. 115 ]</small></sup></span> benaf<i>s</i>man) so long as they are in hell and numerous.

109\. The wicked who are penitent become courageous anew as to the demon who perverts, the living occasion strength [^162], _and_ the retribution of the hellish existence of the wicked is completed, because the increase of sins [^163], owing to the sin which they committed, ceases. 110. They are let out from hell, though their sins are thus accumulated by the demons; they have also prepared [^164] the spirit of sin by the three days _in_ molten metal [^165], which drives away tears, as its name, is owing to the lessening of tears [^166], which is all [^167] in that which _occurs_ when all the doers of actions for the demon of falsehood [^168] pass through that preparation. 111. And _he_ who, _for_ three days, thus bathes (vushakê<i>d</i>ŏ) his sins which are owing to the fiend, and _has_ destroyed the filth (<i>k</i>akhû) of the accumulated sins, is like _those who_ have passed off _and_ turned over a burden.

112\. And the impotence of sin is owing to the destroyer _of_ the fiend by the perception of light, <span id="p116"><sup><small>[ p. 116 ]</small></sup></span> who was their creator [^169]; they (men) all see all, they all forgive, and they all are powerful as regards all _things_ for the creator. 113. And, moreover, after the three days, when they occur, all the creatures of the good creator are purified _and_ pure by the perfect washing passed through, by the most amazing preparation ordained (bakhtŏ), _and_ by the most complete account they render complete. 114. And they are triumphant _over_ the fiend through their own weapons, through their own driving away _of_ their own littleness (kâsvî<i>d</i>ârîh), and the glory of the creator and that of the angels and since he becomes exhausted in resources (dên <i>k</i>âr) they make _him_ become extinct.

115\. _But_ previously [^170] they are attacked, and dispersed, and subdued, and this even fully painfully and with complete experience; and they aid, through backward goodness, in the antagonism of means which are separated divergently, through scattered resources and subdued strength, like the life from the body of worldly mortals, and this, moreover, confusedly, uselessly, and unmovingly. 116. _But_ the abode [^171] for the essential material existence (stî-î <i>k</i>îharîkŏ), about which _there_ is a seeking for interment [^172], is not powerless, and on enquiring the wishes of such numbers [^173] they have <span id="p117"><sup><small>[ p. 117 ]</small></sup></span> cast _him_ out; and no share whatever, _nor_ fragment of a share, of fiendishness, _nor_ even so much as some morsel of unpardonableness sent by fiendishness, remains in this light.

117\. Those who are righteous, intelligent through their own glory of religion--which is a spirit [^174] in the form of light--are scattered (parvandag-aîtŏ) equally around the sky of skies, when from every single side of it _there_ arises, for the sake of margin, three _times_ as much _space_ as the earth created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, in the preparation of the creatures which _were_ created by him. 118. Through his own will he again constructs the bodies of the evil creation, unlaboriously, easily, and full-gloriously, though their construction is even from the clay of Aûshdâ<i>s</i>târ [^175], and their moisture is from the purified water of Arekdvisûr [^176] the undefiled. 119. And from that which is a good protector _through_ him, and which is also connected _with_ <span id="p118"><sup><small>[ p. 118 ]</small></sup></span> _him_, even from the Hadhayã<i>s</i> ox [^177], is the strength of everlasting welfare (vêhgarîh) _and_ immortality; and the living are again produced for the body, they have immortal life, _and_ they become hungerless _and_ thirstless, undecaying _and_ undying, undistressed and undiseased, ever-living _and_ ever-beneficial.

120\. After the renovation _of the universe there_ is no demon, because _there_ is no deceit; and no fiend, because there is no falsity; _there_ is no evil spirit (angraminô), because there is no destruction; _there_ is no hell, because there is no wickedness; _there_ is no strife, because there is no anger; _there_ is no hatred, because there is no ill-temper (dazîh); _there_ is no pain, because there is no disease. 121. _There_ is also no Dahâk [^178], because there is no fear; _there_ is no want, because there is no greediness; _there_ is no shame, because there is no deformity; _there_ is no falsehood [^179], because there is no desire of falsehood; _there_ is no heterodoxy, because there are no false statements; and _there_ is no tardiness, because _it speaks_ of a dilatory (<i>s</i>ustŏ) race in that which is said thus: ‘_They are_ all those of evil thoughts, of evil words, of evil deeds, a race of all evils to be made to tear by the evil spirit.’

122\. And on his (the demon's) disappearance every evil has disappeared, on the disappearance of evil every good is perfected, and in the time of. complete goodness it is not possible to occasion (andâkhtanŏ) any pain _or_ distress whatever, by any means, to any creature. 123. Those who are present (nunak) sufferers [^180], when _there_ is a blow of <span id="p119"><sup><small>[ p. 119 ]</small></sup></span> a fist on the body, or the point of a nail (têkh bûrâk) is driven into a limb, are pained on account of the combination (ham-dâ<i>d</i>akîh) of a different nature for the purposes of the fiend in the body. 124. _But_ at that time of no complication (aham-yâkhtîh), when a limb is struck upon a limb, or even such _a thing_ as a knife, _or_ sword, _or_ club, _or_ stone, _or_ arrow reaches the body, _there_ is no pain _or_ discomfort whatever corresponding to that present pain. 125. And at that time one consideration (vusî<i>d</i>\-aê) occurs, for now the pain from that beating _and_ striking is always owing to that different nature, and on account of _their being_ suitable _to it_, but at that time everything _being_ of like nature and like formation _there_ is never _any_ distress.

126\. And in that most happy time they let the sun, moon, and luminaries exist, but _there_ is no need for a return of the day and a removal of _its going_ forth (frâshm) [^181], for the world is a dispenser (vakhtâr) of all light, and all creatures, too, are brilliant; those luminaries also become as it were perfectly splendid _for_ them. 127. And every creature, too, is of like will and like power; whichever _were_ mortals, unenvious of the welfare of all creatures, are alike joyous, and that _share_ of their position and pleasure rejoices _them_ which has come to them from the glory of all _the existences and_ capabilities of him, the all-good, who is aware of all of everything through his own perfect persistence _and_ complete resources.

128\. And he allots, to the doers of good works <span id="p120"><sup><small>[ p. 120 ]</small></sup></span> and the suitable ranks, the power of a judge (da<i>d</i>akŏ), wealthiness, goodness, and the directorship (ra<i>d</i>îh) of _what_ is intended. 129. _He is_ the designer of _what_ is intended, as it is said about his creatures and capability that fire is producing wind, fire is producing water, and fire is producing earth; wind is producing fire, wind is producing water, and wind is producing earth; water is producing fire, water is producing wind, and water is producing earth; earth is producing fire, earth is producing wind, and earth is producing water. 130. The spirit is both the cause of spirit and the cause of matter (stî<i>s</i>); and the cause of matter, too, is also the cause of spirit, through that perpetual capability.

131\. And, moreover, all the angels, the souls, and the guardian spirits are attending to the wishes _of_ the glory of the creator and the commands of the creator, without trouble _and_ fully rejoicing, in likeness unto the forms of seas, rivers, mountains, trees, and waters [^182]; and they have comforted and decorated the creation. 132. And the angels, souls, and guardian spirits, themselves also the constituted spirits of a former contact with life, are thereby pleased _and_ rejoiced; eternal _and_ thoroughly prepared they are naturalised in that complete joy.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (81:1) This last clause is omitted in M14 and J.

[^2]: (82:1) The interval between the first appearance and the final disappearance of the evil spirit. Twelve thousand years are supposed to elapse between the first creation and the resurrection; during the first three (about B.C. 8400--5400) the creation remains undisturbed in a spiritual state, during the next three (B.C. 5400--2400) the evil spirit appears, but flies back to hell in confusion, during the next three (B.C. 2400--A.D. 600) he attacks the creation and keeps it in a constant state of tribulation, and during the last three (A.D. 600--3600) his power, having attained its maximum, is gradually weakened till it is finally destroyed at the resurrection (see Bd. I, 8, 18, 20, 22, III, I, XXXIV, I--9, Byt. III, II, 44, 52, 61, 62).

[^3]: (82:2) Probably ‘the fiend,’ but the sentence is by no means clear.

[^4]: (82:3) As the verbs ‘allow’ in § 12 and ‘accept’ in § 13 are both plural we must understand that the opposition to the fiend arises from the spiritual creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and not from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> alone.

[^5]: (82:4) Reading minishnŏ instead of maînôgânŏ, ‘spirits;’ the difference between these words in Pahlavi being only a single stroke.

[^6]: (83:1) Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

[^7]: (83:2) The fiend's.

[^8]: (83:3) Reading vêhîkânakŏ vakhshi<i>s</i>nŏ.

[^9]: (83:4) Assuming that andarmûnîh is a form analogous to pirâmûnîh, and with the meaning of andarûnîh.

[^10]: (83:5) The light.

[^11]: (84:1) That is, they are altogether different from the faults of the fiend, just recounted.

[^12]: (84:2) Perhaps the same as ‘the spirit of wisdom’ of Mkh.

[^13]: (84:3) Reading lâ, ‘not,’ instead of râi, ‘on account of.’

[^14]: (85:1) The words va avi<i>g</i>âftŏ afzârîhâ are omitted in M14 and J.

[^15]: (85:2) The evil, spirit. As the co-existent spirits of good and evil are antagonistic the word ham-bu<i>d</i>ikŏ, ‘co-existent,’ is often supposed to mean ‘antagonistic.’

[^16]: (85:3) See § 16. M14 and J have only ‘that occur through his falsity and the constant terror of light which would have arisen from him.’

[^17]: (85:4) That the term asar has only its etymological meaning ‘endless,’ and not the wider sense of ‘eternal,’ is clear from this phrase. The ‘endless light’ is the phrase used in Pahlavi to express Av. anaghra rao<i>k</i><i>a</i>u, a term implying ‘the fixed stars,’ so the passage in the text is very suggestive of the phrase, ‘he made the stars also’ (Gen. i. 16).

[^18]: (85:5) Instead of gun<i>g</i>, ‘space,’ we might read <i>g</i>an<i>g</i>, ‘treasury,’ p. 87 but it is written gûn<i>g</i> in Chap. XXXI, 24, according to K35, and the meaning ‘space’ is more appropriate to the gâtu<i>s</i> <i>h</i><i>v</i>adhâtô, ‘self-sustained place,’ of Vend. XIX, 122. The epithet ‘constantly-beneficial’ is a Pahl. translation of Av. misvâna, and is evidently applied here to the unlimited heavenly space contained in the endless light' (see § 24) and including the supreme heaven, as appears from the order in which these three existences (the earliest creations of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>) are mentioned in Chap. XXXI, 24.

[^19]: (86:1) M14 and J have ‘separate doers.’

[^20]: (86:2) M14 and J have ‘doers at different times.’

[^21]: (87:1) Bd. III, 26 says that ‘the rampart of the sky was formed so that the adversary should not be able. to mingle with it.’

[^22]: (87:2) Reading âgûra<i>z</i>ênd va<i>l</i> ase<i>g</i> gûn.

[^23]: (87:3) Assuming that va<i>l</i> stands for valman or valman<i>s</i>ân.

[^24]: (88:1) Probably referring to the five fiends, or demonesses, which are the special embodiments of each man‘s evil passions, and are thus detailed in Mkh. XLI, 9-11:--’That man is the stronger who is able to contend with his own fiends, and who keeps these five fiends, in particular, far from _his_ body, which are such as avarice, wrath, lust, disgrace, and discontent.'

[^25]: (88:2) Reading fî<i>s</i>ar<i>d</i>akŏ, but the word is doubtful. This central region of the sky would seem to be the place of the ‘ever-stationary,’ if it do not include the earth itself, which is not quite clear, owing to the obscure style of the author.

[^26]: (88:3) While in the world.

[^27]: (88:4) The beneficent and evil spirits.

[^28]: (88:5) Reading venâpênd, but the word is doubtful.

[^29]: (89:1) Below the sun, moon, and stars which protect the creatures.

[^30]: (89:2) Literally ‘springers back.’

[^31]: (89:3) Reading dâmîkŏ, but the word is unusual; it might be read dahmîkô, ‘of the holy man,’ or be considered a corruption of damîkŏ, ‘earth.’

[^32]: (89:4) Reading rangmânŏ, but the word is doubtful.

[^33]: (89:5) Five folios of text are here interpolated in J, of which four contain the passage (Ep. II, vi, 4--ix, 7) omitted at the end of that MS., and the fifth contains a passage on the same subject as Ep. III, and which may possibly be part of the text missing in Ep. III, r 1.

[^34]: (89:6) Meaning that the unembodied spirits of men should enter upon their worldly existence.

[^35]: (89:7) The great-grandson of the primeval man, Gâyômar<i>d</i>, and the forefather of the fifteen races of undeformed human beings (see Bd. XV, 25-31, XXXI, 1).

[^36]: (90:1) See Chap. II, 10 for this and the following three names.

[^37]: (90:2) He is said to have kept the evil spirit thirty years as a steed (see Râm Yt. 12, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 29, Mkh. XXVII, 22).

[^38]: (90:3) Here written <i>G</i>îm.

[^39]: (90:4) Instinctive wisdom and that acquired by experience (see Chap. XL, 3).

[^40]: (90:5) Av. Manu<i>s</i><i>k</i>ithra; the descendant of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, in the eleventh generation, who overthrew the usurpation of the collateral branches of his family, and restored the Irânian line of the Pê<i>s</i>dâdian dynasty in his own person (see Bd. XXXI, 12-14, XXXIV, 6).

[^41]: (90:6) See Chap. XVII, 6.

[^42]: (90:7) Av. Kavi Kavâta; the first king of the Kayânian dynasty (see Bd. XXXI, 24, 25, XXXIV, 7).

[^43]: (90:8) Probably the Av. Aoshnara, mentioned in Af. Zarat., along with several of the other names, in a passage somewhat similar to that in our text. The name here can also be read Aûsh-khûr.

[^44]: (90:9) Av. Kavi Syâvarshân; the son of king Kaî-Kâûs and father of king Kaî-Khûsrôî, but he did not reign himself. He is said to have formed the settlement of Kangde<i>z</i> (see Chap. XC, 5, Bd. XXXI, 25, Byt. III, 25, 26).

[^45]: (90:10) See Chap. XXXVI, 3.

[^46]: (90:11) Av.. Kavi Vî<i>s</i>tâspa, Pers. Gu<i>s</i>tâsp; the fifth king of the Kayânian dynasty, who received the religion from Zaratû<i>s</i>t. His father, the fourth king, was of collateral descent from the first king (see Bd. XXXI, 28, 29, XXXIV, 7).

[^47]: (90:12) The great apostle of the Parsis (see Chap. II, 10).

[^48]: (90:13) Av. Peshôtanu; a son of Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, who is said to be p. 91 immortal and to live in Kangde<i>z</i>, whence he is to come to restore the religion in the millennium of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar (see Chap. XC, 3, 5, Bd. XXIX, 5, Byt. III, 25-32, 36-38, 41, 42).

[^49]: (91:1) Probably the supreme high-priest and prime minister of the ninth Sasanian king, Shâpûr II (A.D. 309--379; see Bd. XXXIII, 3).

[^50]: (91:2) See Chap. II, 10 for thee, last three names. The terms mânsarîk, ‘liturgical,’ dâ<i>d</i>îk, ‘legal,’ and gâsânîk, ‘metrical,’ are those applied to the three divisions of the twenty-one Nasks, or books of the complete literature of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers.

[^51]: (91:3) M14 and J have merely ‘granted assistance in the struggle at the renovation.’

[^52]: (91:4) Assuming that gha<i>l</i> stands for valman, as it sometimes does.

[^53]: (92:1) M14 and J have merely: ‘are a succession in adversity and perpetuity of life.’

[^54]: (92:2) Assuming that tarâ<i>z</i> stands for tarâ<i>z</i>ûk. The meaning is that any one who has successfully struggled with sin in the world, and leaves offspring behind him, goes to his account, at the balance of the angel Rashnû, with cheerfulness.

[^55]: (92:3) This seems to be a variation of the statement in Byt. II, 13, where Zaratû<i>s</i>t, after asking for immortality, and having had the omniscient wisdom infused into him for a week, describes what he had seen, and amongst other things says: ‘I saw a wealthy _man_ without children, and it did not seem to me commendable; and I p. 93 saw a pauper with many children, and it seemed to me commendable.’

[^56]: (93:1) The Av. âsna frazai<i>n</i>ti<i>s</i>, ‘inherent or natural offspring,’ of Yas. LIX, 14, &c. The Pahl. equivalents âsnû<i>d</i>ak and âsnî<i>d</i>ak can hardly be mere transliterations of âsna, but are more probably translations, formed of â+<i>s</i>unu<i>d</i>ak and <i>s</i>inî<i>d</i>ak, with some such meaning as ‘assured.’

[^57]: (93:2) These three future apostles (see Chap. II, 10) are considered to be sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t (see Bd. XXXII, 8).

[^58]: (93:3) Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

[^59]: (93:4) These first four demons are described in Bd. XXVIII, 7, 15-17, 23, 26.

[^60]: (93:5) The words nîyaî<i>z</i>înâkŏ tangîh bû<i>d</i>ŏ bakhtŏ, here translated, may possibly be a miswriting of five names of demons.

[^61]: (93:6) The bad Vâê (see Chap. XXX, 4).

[^62]: (93:7) See Bd. XXVIII, 25.

[^63]: (93:8) A demon of death (see Chap. XXIII, 3, note, Bd. XXVIII, 35).

[^64]: (93:9) Another demon of death (see Chap. XXXII, 4, 7).

[^65]: (93:10) The mountainous country south of the Caspian, said to be full of demons, the Mâzainya daêva of the Avesta (see Bd. III, Lo, XV, 28). These demons were, no doubt, merely idolators.

[^66]: (94:1) See § 28.

[^67]: (94:2) By omitting a stroke nô<i>s</i>, ‘agreeable,’ would become vêh, ‘good.’

[^68]: (94:3). The sole-created, or primeval ox, whence all animals are said to have sprung. For an account of this incursion of the fiend, see Bd. III, 12-20, VIII, 1, Zs. II, 1-11.

[^69]: (94:4) M14 and J have ‘even to the upper sky of the middle third,’ which means the same thing, as the author's words imply that the demons did not enter the upper third, but only reached its borders (see § 49).

[^70]: (94:5) M14 and J conclude the sentence as follows: ‘the pure religion, solving doubts, is arrayed.’

[^71]: (94:6) Reading vandvar Pêrvakŏ. The author seems to have been thinking of Yas. IX, 81: Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a brought to thee the star-studded, spirit-fashioned girdle (the belt of Orion) leading the Pleiades; the good Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion‘ (Haug’s Essays, p. 182).

[^72]: (95:1) Or, zôharakŏ may mean ‘venomous.’ Mîtôkht was the first demon produced by the evil spirit (see Bd. I, 24, XXVIII, 14, 16) who is supposed to be as much ‘the father of lies’ as his counterpart, the devil of the Christians.

[^73]: (95:2) Or, zôhar may mean ‘venom.’

[^74]: (95:3) Mîtôkht.

[^75]: (95:4) See § 44.

[^76]: (95:5) See Chap. XXIII, 3.

[^77]: (95:6) See Bd. XXVIII, 27.

[^78]: (95:7) Reading pê<i>s</i> ti<i>s</i>nŏ-î sagak nô<i>s</i>ânînî<i>d</i>anŏ, but we might read pê<i>s</i> ti<i>s</i>nŏg sedkûni<i>s</i>nînî<i>d</i>anŏ, ‘causing gnawing before being thirsty.’

[^79]: (95:8) See § 44 for this demon and the next two.

[^80]: (96:1) One of the seven arch-fiends, the Av. Zairi<i>k</i>a, which probably means ‘decay,’ but from the resemblance of his name to zâhar, ‘poison,’ he is called ‘the maker of poison’ (see Bd. I, 27, XXVIII, II).

[^81]: (96:2) See Bd. XXVIII, 26.

[^82]: (96:3) Reading gadman bîm, but it may be yadman bîm, ‘dreading the hand;’ and it is doubtful whether the epithet be applied to Nîyâ<i>z</i>, or to Nihîv.

[^83]: (96:4) Reading î instead of the va, ‘and,’ of the MSS.

[^84]: (96:5) See § 44.

[^85]: (96:6) See § 50.

[^86]: (97:1) Reading paitîyârakŏ, but K35 and J have paîtâ<i>z</i>ârakŏ, which, if it be a real word; would have nearly the same meaning.

[^87]: (97:2) Shooting stars, meteors, and comets, the last of which are apparently intended by the term Mû<i>s</i>par (Av. Mû<i>s</i> pairika, ‘the Mû<i>s</i> witch’) of Bd. V, 1, XXVIII, 44.

[^88]: (97:3) That is, the luminaries which have to prevent these beings from becoming obscured by the darkness produced by the evil spirits.

[^89]: (97:4) By the omission of one loop the MSS. have ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ânŏ, ‘angels,’ instead of shêdânŏ, ‘demons;’ the difference between the two words being very slight in Pahlavi characters.

[^90]: (98:1) Reading an-âyin gun, but this is uncertain.

[^91]: (98:2) Reading <i>k</i>îhar-tanû nîzah; the last word is usually spelt nîzak, but occurs in § 58 in the same form as here.

[^92]: (98:3) Reading nîvîkânmank gûn, but this is uncertain.

[^93]: (99:1) The unorthodox, or those holding erroneous views regarding the traditions handed down by them.

[^94]: (99:2) Reading âf<i>r</i>în.î<i>d</i>ŏ, which K 35 has converted into afgônê<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘casts,’ by inverting the order of the two central characters.

[^95]: (99:3) M14 and J omit the words from ‘through’ to ‘remembrance.’ The author means that he has acquired much information on the subject even from the opinions of the unorthodox judiciously studied.

[^96]: (99:4) M14 has merely the words: ‘and the completely-happy progress,’ &c.

[^97]: (100:1) K35 has altered dakhshakŏ, ‘token,’ into dahi<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘creation,’ by changing one letter, and M14 and J have adopted the wrong reading.

[^98]: (100:2) Reading <i>k</i>îgûn dên hâvandîh <i>k</i>îr â<i>z</i> dên khadûkŏ. The drift of these two first reasons seems to be that the fiend, being an invader and outnumbered, must. be vanquished in the end.

[^99]: (100:3) Reading zak-î zôr drû<i>g</i>ô dên-i dâ<i>d</i>âr ba<i>r</i>â-atô<i>g</i>îgânŏ-î stî<i>s</i> vahânŏ-î nirûkŏ-hômandîh. This phrase seems to have been generally misunderstood by copyists, as both M14 and J have altered it into something like: ‘when the violence of the fiend is in the hand of the creator, yet even if the motive of the army is so much power.’

[^100]: (100:4) M14 and J omit this clause, from ‘but’ to ‘beaten.’

[^101]: (101:1) The term zênô afzâr evidently refers here to the warrior‘s stock of arrows and other missiles which were to be expended in battle, so that it is analogous to the modern term ’ammunition:

[^102]: (101:2) M14 has yehevûnê<i>d</i>, ‘becomes,’ instead of dânôstŏ, ‘known.’

[^103]: (101:3) M14 and J omit these last four words.

[^104]: (101:4) The argument, both in this case and the preceding one, is that even when two combatants are equal in power and resources the hasty aggressor is likely to be beaten in the end, and, therefore, p. 102 the inferiority of the fiend is still more likely to lead to his final defeat.

[^105]: (102:1) M14 begins a fresh argument here, owing to some misunderstanding of the meaning of the sentence.

[^106]: (102:2) That is, the advantage of driving away the fiend in this life is a counterpart of the blessings attained at the resurrection.

[^107]: (102:3) The word drû<i>g</i>ânŏ, ‘fiends,’ is omitted in K35, but is evidently necessary to complete the sentence.

[^108]: (102:4) This appears to be a description of ordeal by poison and the two usual modes of evading its operation: The hasty evader relies upon deceitfully substituting a wholesome, powder for the p. 103 poison he has to take; while the more cautious evader trusts to recognising his adversary's poison by its taste, and selecting another poison as an antidote for both to take, so that the hasty evader suffers through his own deceit in not taking the first poison. Similarly, the fiend is supposed to suffer in the end from the death and destruction which he was the first to introduce into the world.

[^109]: (103:1) By omitting a phrase M14 and J have: ‘and the management of the fiend of scornful looks is as _it were_ existing with,’ &c.

[^110]: (103:2) This is little more than a guess at the meaning of a word which can be read vashakî<i>d</i>ŏ (compare Pers. ga<i>s</i> and ka<i>s</i>îdan). The whole sentence is rather uncertain.

[^111]: (103:3) The argument is that this unstable power of the fiend cannot permanently stand against the consolidated strength of the creator.

[^112]: (103:4) Adopting J‘s reading samakgûntar, but K35 has vasmakgûntar, which may be ’very troublesome,‘ and M14 has samkîntar, probably for sahmgîntar, ’very terrible.'

[^113]: (104:1) That is, the guardian spirit (see Chap. II, 5) which is not rendered wicked by the sin of the soul.

[^114]: (104:2) The phrase mûn rûbân-î zak darvand is ambiguous, as it might mean ‘which is the soul of that wicked one,’ but this is not reconcile able with the context.

[^115]: (104:3) See Chap. II, 10. Yim-î shê<i>d</i>ô is the Yimô khshaêtô of Vend. II, 43, 45, the Jamshêd of the Shâhnâmah. The legends here referred to are mentioned in Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 130-138, where the guardian spirit of Yima is said to withstand the misfortune brought on by the demons, while that of Thraêtaona (Frê<i>d</i>ûn) withstands various diseases, and those of other heroes withstand various other evils and demons.

[^116]: (104:4) Reading pavan bêsh-i<i>k</i> ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>ârân, but for i<i>k</i> we ought probably to read a<i>z</i>, so as to make the phrase correspond to the Av. a<i>z</i>i-kar<i>s</i>tahê <i>d</i>baeshanghô of Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 131.

[^117]: (105:1) Instead of zî<i>s</i> madam, ‘that is owing to him,’ we ought probably to read zî<i>s</i> bar, ‘that is his production;’ the Huz. madam, which is the proper equivalent of the preposition bar, ‘on, according to,’ being wrongly used for the noun bar, ‘produce.’

[^118]: (105:2) See § 44.

[^119]: (105:3) The Mâzainya daêva of the Avesta (see § 44, note).

[^120]: (105:4) The sole-created, or primeval, man from whom the whole human race is said to have sprung (see Chap. II, 10, Bd. III, 14. 77, 19-23, XV, I, 31).

[^121]: (105:5) The progenitors of the undeformed human race, who are said to have grown up, in the manner of a plant, from the seed of the dead Gâyômar<i>d</i> (see Bd. XV, 2-5). Their names are derived from Av. mashya mashyôi, ‘the man and woman,’ but the latter form is no longer extant in the Avesta. From Av. mashya we have the Mashya of Bd. XV, 6, and the Mâshya of Bd. XV, II, 19, 20, 30. From its dialectical variant martiya in ancient Pers., which would be marethya in the Avesta (compare Av. mareta, Pers. mard), we have the Marhayâ of our text. And by transposition of the letters rt = reth = rha in these latter forms, we have the Matrô of Bd. XV, 2 and the Maharîh or Maharyâ of Bd. XV, 22, note. Other forms of these names also occur (see Chaps. LXIV, 2, LXV, 2, LXXVII, 4).

[^122]: (105:6) M14 has ‘of brother and sister,’ but the insertion of the extra word is unnecessary. Regarding khvêtudâ<i>d</i>, or next-of-kin marriage, see Chap. LXV.

[^123]: (105:7) Reading lâ-khâ<i>g</i>astŏ; the fiend is certainly ‘unlucky’ here, p. 106 as by introducing death into the world he merely increases the number of beings who pass into the other world to join his opponents in the end; but the text probably means that he is ‘inauspicious’ and wishes to bring misfortune on mankind.

[^124]: (106:1) Astô-vîdâ<i>d</i> (see § 81).

[^125]: (106:2) The argument is that, as the sun is able to subdue darkness, the most constant quality of the fiend, every day, it is probable that the fiend himself will be entirely subdued in the end.

[^126]: (107:1) Assuming that apûrâstîh stands for apûr râstîh; it may, however, be intended for a<i>v</i>î-râstîh, ‘want of truth.’ The meaning is that even true statements become perverted by inaccurate speakers.

[^127]: (107:2) Perhaps sapû<i>s</i>ag, ‘bran,’ may have originally been sapzag, ‘green.’

[^128]: (107:3) Written Abrêhâm-î Tarsâkîgân.

[^129]: (107:4) The letter <i>s</i> in Ma<i>s</i>îkhâ is here written like âî, but the word is correctly written in § 91.

[^130]: (108:1) The phrase is ba<i>r</i>manŏ-î dâ<i>d</i>, literally ‘son of the created one,’ unless we assume that dâ<i>d</i> is taken as a name of God. It is, however, quite conceivable that a priest would be reluctant to admit that a strange god could be anything better than a created being. That dâ<i>d</i> is here used as a noun, and not with the meaning of ‘gift’ or ‘law,’ appears from the subsequent phrase dâ<i>d</i>ŏ-î amîrâkŏ yakhsenund, ‘the created one whom they consider undying.’

[^131]: (108:2) Owing to the frequent repetitions of the same words in these phrases they are specially liable to corruption by copyists, but as they stand in K35 they can hardly be translated otherwise than as questions. M14 and J have an altered text which may be translated as follows:--‘for whomever he did not die, when dead, he is as dead; for whomever it is said he died, he is so when he is mentioned as dead;’ but this seems no improvement of the text.

[^132]: (108:3) Referring to those who compile commentaries and mutilate texts to suit their own views.

[^133]: (109:1) The argument is that even heterodoxy, ‘the most mischievous weapon’ of the fiend (see § 87), must fail in the end, because, like other revolutions, it relies on constant change, which implies want of permanency.

[^134]: (109:2) Malkôsânâ, ‘of Malkôs,’ is a denominative adjective derived from Chald. ו םַ?Lְ?Q?Wֹסה ‘autumnal rain.’ The deluging rain of Malkôs is supposed to usher in the dreadful winter foretold to Yima in Vend. II, 46-56, when all, or nearly all, living creatures were to perish, a truly glacial epoch. In a Persian paraphrase of the Bahman Vast (see Byt. Introd. p. lix) this period of Malkôs is described as follows:--‘As three hundred years have elapsed from the time of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar (Byt. III, 44-49) the period of Malkôs comes on; and the winter of. Malkôs is, such that, owing to the cold and snow which occur, out of a myriad of men in the world only one will remain, and the trees and shrubs all become withered, and the quadrupeds, whether carrying, walking, leaping, or grazing, will all utterly die. Then, by command of God, they will come from the enclosure formed by Vim, and the men and quadrupeds from that place spread over Irân, and make the world populous a second time, and it is the beginning of the millennium of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar(-mâh).’

[^135]: (109:3) The formation of the enclosure was ordered, as a precaution by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> (see Vend. II, 61-92).

[^136]: (110:1) Reading Yim-ka<i>r</i><i>d</i> var, but these words are corrupted in three different ways in the three MSS. consulted. This enclosure is said to have been in the middle of Pârs in Bd. XXIX, 14.

[^137]: (110:2) Av. Vivangh<i>a</i>u (see Bd. XXXI, 2).

[^138]: (110:3) That is, a type of the resurrection.

[^139]: (110:4) The Av. A<i>z</i>i Dahâka, ‘destructive serpent,’ slain by Thraêtaona. In later times he was converted into a usurping king, or dynasty, the Dha‘h‘hâk of the Shâhnâmah, who conquered Yim (Jamshêd) and, after a reign of a thousand years, was defeated by Frê<i>d</i>ûn (Thraêtaona) and fettered under Mount Dimâvand; whence he is to escape during the millennium of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh to devastate the world, till he is finally slain by the hero Keresâsp, who is revived for the purpose (see Bd. XXIX, 8, g, XXXI, 6, Byt. III, 56-60.

[^140]: (110:5) That is, attached to the shoulders like wings; referring to the serpents said to have grown from the shoulders of Dahâk.

[^141]: (110:6) M14 alters shêdân, ‘demons,’ into gêhân, ‘world,’ so as to read ‘through the demon of witchcraft remains a destroyer unto the world.’ The alteration in the Pahlavi text is small, but seems unnecessary.

[^142]: (111:1) Reading angê<i>z</i>ŏî-aîtŏ, instead of the unintelligible angî<i>d</i>î-aîtŏ.

[^143]: (111:2) See Chap. XVII, 6.

[^144]: (111:3) Dahâk and all other heinous offenders are said to undergo a special punishment for three nights at the resurrection, and are then finally purified by passing through molten metal like the rest of mankind (see Bd. XXX, 16, 20).

[^145]: (111:4) See § 44.

[^146]: (111:5) Perhaps referring to the liturgical recitations.

[^147]: (111:6) In the atmosphere apparently (see Bd. I, 4).

[^148]: (111:7) Written Hadhayãm here, but Hadhayă<i>s</i> in § 119, Chaps. XLVIII, 34, XC, 4, and Hadhayô<i>s</i> or Hadhayâv<i>s</i> in Bd. XIX, 13, XXX, 25, though always in Pâzand. It is also called Sarsaok, or Srisaok, in Bd. XV, 27, XVII, 4, XIX, 13, always in Pâzand, and his name is converted into Pahl. Srûvô in Zs. XI, 10. p. 112 It is said to be an ox which never dies till it is slaughtered at the resurrection, so that its fat may form one of the ingredients of the elixir of immortality which all men have then to taste; it is also said that mankind, in ancient times, crossed the ocean on its back, when going to settle in the other regions of the earth. From what is stated in the text it may be supposed to be some form of cloud myth, but it is not mentioned in the extant portion of the Avesta, unless ‘the ox Hadhayô<i>s</i>’ be taken as a corruption of gâu<i>s</i> hudh<i>a</i>u, ‘the well-yielding ox,’ and Sarsaok as connected with Pers. sri<i>s</i>k,‘ a drop,’ and referring to showers of rain; but this is very uncertain.

[^149]: (112:1) The power of the white Hôm mentioned below.

[^150]: (112:2) As, it is said, they will do for ten years before Sôshâns, the last apostle, appears to prepare for the resurrection (see Chap. XXXV, 3, Bd. XXX, 3).

[^151]: (112:3) A tree said to grow in the ocean, the juice of which is the other ingredient of the elixir of immortality; it is also called Gôkarn, or Gôkar<i>d</i>, Av. gaokerena, and is guarded by ten enormous fish (see Bd. XVIII, 1-3, XXVII, 4, XXX, 25).

[^152]: (112:4) The existence of such immortal creatures; said to be intended for special use at the resurrection, is here taken as a proof of the reality of the resurrection itself. Whether the seven immortals described in Chap. XC are to be included among them is uncertain.

[^153]: (113:1) That is, the demons do not come into personal conflict with material creatures, but are supposed to influence their evil passions and to pervert the original laws of nature.

[^154]: (113:2) M14 omits the passage from this word to the same word in § 104.

[^155]: (113:3) The word sôbârê<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘rides, mounts,’ both here and in § 10b, is possibly only a miswriting of the very similar word dûbârê<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘runs, rushes.’ Several words in this sentence are accidentally omitted in M14.

[^156]: (113:4) See § 44.

[^157]: (113:5) As it is uncertain whether the ‘dying _one_’ is a human being or the demon himself, it is doubtful which of them is here supposed to commit suicide. M14 and J have merely: ‘nor even among the p. 114 creatures of the sacred beings those which are an antagonism of himself;’ apparently connecting this section with the next. This final argument is that, as the demons by their very nature must injure their friends if they fail with their enemies, they contain within themselves the source of their own final destruction. In other words: ‘if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end’ (Mark iii. 26).

[^158]: (114:1) The army of angels of §§ 58, 64. The author, having exhausted his arguments in favour of the final triumph of the good creation, now returns to his description of the issue of the contest, which he was about to commence in § 64.

[^159]: (114:2) M14 and J omit the following words as far as ‘provided.’

[^160]: (114:3) See Chap. XXIII, 3.

[^161]: (114:4) Or, perhaps, ‘concealment,’ as there is some doubt whether aûbênî<i>d</i>ârîh means ‘making unseeing, or making unseen.’

[^162]: (115:1) That is, the wicked who are still living, being penitent, rein-force the host of the righteous.

[^163]: (115:2) Referring probably to the ‘growth of sin’ mentioned in Chaps. XI, 2, XII, 5.

[^164]: (115:3) That is, ‘purified.’

[^165]: (115:4) All men are said to be purified, at the time of the resurrection, by passing through melted metal, which seems like warm milk to the righteous, but is a final torment to the wicked (see Chap. XXXII, 12, 13, Bd. XXX, 19, 20).

[^166]: (115:5) This would seem to allude to some Avesta name of this molten metal, which is no longer extant.

[^167]: (115:6) We should probably read hamâî, ‘ever,’ instead of hamâk, ‘all.’

[^168]: (115:7) Reading zûr, but it may be zôr, ‘violence.’

[^169]: (116:1) That is, the destroyer of the fiend was the creator of the men mentioned in § 10S. The reading sinâ<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘perception,’ is uncertain; perhaps we ought to read ‘in the regions (dîvâgânŏ) of light.’

[^170]: (116:2) That is, before the purification in molten metal.

[^171]: (116:3) The ‘body,’ apparently, but this section is by no means clear.

[^172]: (116:4) This must be on the part of the fiend, as burial is unlawful.

[^173]: (116:5) Perhaps the meaning is that the fiend is at length overcome by the constantly accumulating numbers of the penitent wicked.

[^174]: (117:1) The handsome maiden who is supposed to meet the departed soul, and whose form is an embodiment of its own deeds and religion (see Chaps. XXIV, 5 XLIV, 20). Or, perhaps, the angel of religion (Dîn) itself, which is reverenced for its radiance and glory in Din Yt. 4.

[^175]: (117:2) A mythical mountain (see Chap. XXX, 2).

[^176]: (117:3) The mythical source of pure water which is said to flow from Mount Albûr<i>z</i> into Lake Urvis on the summit of Mount Hûgar, and thence to Mount Aûsîndôm in the wide-formed ocean, whence it partly flows into the ocean, and partly rains upon the earth (see Bd. XIII, 1, 3-5). Much the same account of it is given in Chap. XCII, 5, only the lake is said to be on the summit of Mount Aûsîndôm. It is the Av. Ardvî sûra of the Âbân Yt., and the Pahl. form Arekdvisûr = Aregdvisûr may be explained as a trans-position of Aredgvisûr, an ordinary mispronunciation of Ardvî sûra. Modern Parsis, who consider the Pahl. k as silent (or merely a soft aspirate) after a vowel, would pronounce Aredvisûr.

[^177]: (118:1) See § 99.

[^178]: (118:2) See § 97.

[^179]: (118:3) M14 and J omit what follows, as far as 'heterodoxy.

[^180]: (118:4) Literally ‘attainers to endurance.’

[^181]: (119:1) The ‘going forth’ of the day or the sun means its disappearance or going away, and is an Avesta phrase. The sun is supposed to be ‘forth’ when it is absent, not when it appears.

[^182]: (120:1) All objects being supposed to be represented by guardian spirits in the other world.
