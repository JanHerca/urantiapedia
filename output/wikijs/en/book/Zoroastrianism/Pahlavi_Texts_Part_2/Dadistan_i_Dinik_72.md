## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXII.

1\. _As to_ the seventy-first question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: What are the heinous sins of committing unnatural intercourse, is it proper to order _or_ perform the _sacred_ ceremony for him who shall commit unnatural intercourse, _and_ is it then proper to practise sitting together and eating together with him who shall commit _it_, and shall commit _it with_ a longing for it, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that of the evil Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers [^1]\—who _were_ the seven evil-doers of sin of a heinous kind [^2], whose practice of Aharman's _will was_ as much as an approximation to _that of_  <span id="p217"><sup><small>[ p. 217 ]</small></sup></span> Aharman _himself_\—two are those whom you have mentioned, who are defiled with mutual sin. 3. For, of those seven evil-doers, one _was_ A<i>z</i>\-î Dahâk [^3], by whom witchcraft _was_ first glorified; he exercised the sovereignty of misgovernment, and desired a life of the unintellectual (ahangân khayâ) for the world. 4. One _was_ A<i>z</i>î Sruvar [^4], by whom infesting the highway _in_ terrible modes, frightful watchfulness (vîmag-bî<i>d</i>ârîh) [^5] of the road, and devouring of horse _and_ man _were_ perpetrated. 5. One _was_ Va<i>d</i>ak [^6] the mother of Dahâk, by whom adultery _was_ first committed, and by it all lineage is disturbed, control is put an end to, and without the authority of the husband an intermingling of son with son [^7] occurs. 6. One _was_ the Vîptak [^8] (‘pathic’) <span id="p218"><sup><small>[ p. 218 ]</small></sup></span> _in_ the intercourse of males, the infecundity of which is the desire of men; and by him the intercourse of males _and_ the way of destroying the seed _were_ first shown unto males. 7. One _was_ the Vîpînî<i>d</i>ak [^9] (‘pæderast’), the male by whom the use of females _was_ first brought among the errors (khazdag) of the male, and _was_ despised (dûkhtŏ) by him; he who is a cherisher of seed is delivering _it_ to females, and that which is destroying the seed is the flowing of stenches into the prescribed vessels [^10] for it, the delivering _it_ to males by a demoniacal process, and carrying on a practice which effaces (âhan<i>g</i>ê<i>d</i>ŏ) _and_ conceals the race [^11] of the living. 8. One _was_ Tûr-î Brâ<i>d</i>ar-vakhsh [^12], the Karap _and_ heterodox wizard, by whom the best of men _was_ put to death. 9. And one _was_ he by whom the religions of apostates [^13] _were_ preferred—through the deceitfulness of the perverted text and interpretation [^14] which they themselves utter—to the law which the righteous <span id="p219"><sup><small>[ p. 219 ]</small></sup></span> _has_ praised, that existence _which_ would have procured a complete remedy, _and_ would have become the eternity of the records which bestow salvation, through the good righteousness which is owing to the pure religion, the best of knowledge.

10\. And they who are defiled by a propensity to stench are thereby welcoming the demons _and_ fiends [^15], _and_ are far from good thought [^16] through vexing _it_; and a distance from them is _to be maintained_ of necessity in sitting and eating with _them_, except so far as _it may be_ opportune for the giving of incitement _by_ words for withdrawing (pa<i>d</i>âli<i>s</i>nŏ) from _their_ sinfulness, while converting _them_ from that propensity. 11. _Should one_ die, to order a ceremonial for him is indecorous, and to perform _it_ would be unauthorised; but if _he were_ to do _so_ penitently _one_ would then be authorised to perform his ceremonial after the three _nights_ [^17], for it is the remedy for atonement of sin. 12. And so long as _he_ is living _he_ is in the contingencies (vakhtagânŏ) owing to the sickness through which _he_ is in that way an infamous _one_ (akhamî<i>d</i>âr), and _there_ are no preventives (bôndagânŏ) and medicinal powder for it; these are teachings also for the duty and good works of a ceremonial for the soul [^18].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (216:2) M14 has ‘of a like evil practice, in inclination for sins, were the very heinous in the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers.’

[^2]: (216:3) Reading girâî van vinâs, and assuming that van is a miswriting of gûn.

[^3]: (217:1) See Chap.. XXXVII, 97.

[^4]: (217:2) A personification of Av. a<i>z</i>i srvara, a serpent or dragon thus described in the Hôm Yt. (Yas. IX, 34-39):--‘(Keresâspa) who slew the serpent Srvara which devoured horses and men, which was poisonous and yellow, over which yellow poison flowed a hand’s-breadth (spear‘s-length?) high. On which Keresâspa cooked a beverage in a caldron at the mid-day hour, and the serpent scorched, hissed, sprang forth, away from the caldron, and upset the boiling water; Keresâspa Nareman<i>a</i>u fled aside frightened’ (see Haug's Essays, pp. 178, 179). The same account is given in Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 40.

[^5]: (217:3) M14 has bîmînî<i>d</i>ârîh, ‘terrifying.’

[^6]: (217:4) See Chap. LXXVIII, a. There is possibly some connection between this name and the Av. epithet, Vadhaghana, which is thus mentioned by the evil spirit, speaking to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, in Vend. XIX, 23:--‘Curse the good Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion! and thou shalt obtain fortune such as the Vadhaghana sovereign obtained;’ and Mkh. LVII, 25 calls him ‘the Va<i>d</i>agân sovereign Dahâk.’ The Pahlavi writers seem to have taken this epithet as a matronymic, owing to its form, but whether the mother's name be really traditional, or merely manufactured from the epithet, is doubtful.

[^7]: (217:5) Reading levatman ba<i>r</i>man ba<i>r</i>man, instead of levatman bûm ba<i>r</i>man. M14 omits bûm.

[^8]: (217:6) Av. viptô (p. p. of vip, ‘to sow, to fecundate’), used in the p. 218 sense of ‘a pathic’ in Vend. VIII, 102. This name, as well as the next one, is used here more as representing a class than an individual.

[^9]: (218:1) The p. p. of the causal form of vîptanŏ, ‘to fecundate,’ used as an equivalent of the Av. vaêpayô of Vend. VIII, 102.

[^10]: (218:2) Assuming that pavan pavan mû<i>d</i>ragânŏ stands for pavan farmû<i>d</i> ragânŏ; but there is some doubt as to the correct reading of several words in this section.

[^11]: (218:3) Or ‘seed.’

[^12]: (218:4) The eldest of five brothers who were wizards of the Karap race or caste, and deadly enemies of Zaratû<i>s</i>t (see Byt. II, 3). He is said to have slain Zaratû<i>s</i>t in the end.

[^13]: (218:5) Aharmôkô, Av. ashemaogha, means literally ‘disturbing the right,’ and is a term applied to an ungodly man specially under the influence of the evil spirit, as an apostate is naturally supposed to be.

[^14]: (218:6) The Avesta and Zand.

[^15]: (219:1) Who are supposed to seize upon them and pervade them; hence the necessity of shunning such men, to avoid contamination from the demons who possess them.

[^16]: (219:2) That is, from what is personified in the archangel Vohûman.

[^17]: (219:3) During which the soul is supposed to remain on earth, hovering about the body, after death (see Chaps. XX, 2, XXIV, 2, XXV, 2).

[^18]: (219:4) That is, they are warnings to him to repent.
