## EPISTLE II. TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER VI.

1\. When at _any_ time I write more pleasantly, this directs _you_ to understand that still with the steadfast, are my affection and natural lowly-mindedness; afterwards, too, that which _happens_ when you have kept me wide away from the way of brotherhood, and higher even than a father, master, leader, ruler, _or_ high-priest, is due to the fame and happiness of <span id="p349"><sup><small>[ p. 349 ]</small></sup></span> my body _and_ life, not _to_ affection of character, but the position of religion _and_ the command of the sacred beings. 2. On that account, when you have seen the pure religiousness, the learned knowledge, _and_ the repose-promoting truth of the invisible (avênâpîh) _of_ which my [^1] heart is leaping with evidence, so that you are steadfast even unto the nôi<i>d</i> asta-<i>k</i>a (‘not though the body’) _of_ which Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân spoke [^2]\—and, because, turned by me to the religion which is thy passport (parvânakŏ) to the best existence, you have understood _that_ it is the organizer of the greatest protection, _even_ that is supposed by me—I undergo all the terror of the period in hope of the supreme recompense.

3\. And the position that that religion _has_ given, which on that account is mine, you have that way considered as supremacy [^3]; and if, sent from you or another person, the opposition of _one of_ the same religion is seen _to be_ the dispersion and disruption of the appointed profession, I act against the continuance of the opposition, and as steadfastly as the series (zarah) of submissiveness and gratification of _your_ priestly lordship _has_ done to me. 4. And this _will_ be undoubtedly realised by you, that if you do not turn away from this decree which is not preservative, but, _being_ appointed, I reach out from <span id="p350"><sup><small>[ p. 350 ]</small></sup></span> the country of Irân [^4], then I _shall_ become its greatest attacker of you. 5. And so I consider that from my opposition it is possible _for_ more harm to happen unto you than from many accusers who are like the leader of those of the good religion, the many who are as _it were_ of like fame with me.

6\. And also from my departure, and the non-existence _of one_ that is a friend of yours, who, like me, is less able to be for your harm than he who is _one_ of the many accusers of whom it is I who am the restrainer, you know this, that my coming is on account of the affection of some and the reverence of others. 7. From the exercise of religion I do not at all fall _away_, and for the sake of the position of the religion I am maintaining opposition [^5] to any one; even when he is a friend _who_ is loved by me, I am then his antagonist 8. Fate (zîkŏ) [^6] is the great truth of the vacant, the form (andâm) [^7] which _has_ procured the light of life.
