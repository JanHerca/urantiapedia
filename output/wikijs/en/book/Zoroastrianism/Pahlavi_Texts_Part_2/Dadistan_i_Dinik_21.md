## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXI.

1\. The twentieth question is that which you ask thus: How are the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, the Dâîtih peak (<i>k</i>akâ<i>d</i>), and the path of the righteous and wicked; <span id="p48"><sup><small>[ p. 48 ]</small></sup></span> how _are they_ when _one_ is righteous, and how when _one_ is wicked?

2\. The reply is this, that thus the high-priests _have_ said, that the Dâîtih peak [^1] is in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> [^2], 2, in the middle of the world; reaching unto the vicinity of that peak is that beam-shaped (dâr-kerpô) spirit, the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge [^3], which is thrown _across_ from the Albûr<i>z</i> enclosure (var) back to the Dâîtih peak. 3. As _it were_ that bridge is like a beam of many sides, of whose edges (pô<i>s</i>tŏ) there are _some_ which are broad, and there are _some_ which are thin _and_ sharp; its broad sides (sûkîhâ) are so large that its width is twenty-seven reeds (nâî), and its sharp sides are so contracted (tang) that in thinness _it_ is just like the edge of a razor. 4. And when the' souls of the righteous and wicked arrive it turns to that side which is _suitable to_ their necessities, through the great glory of the creator and the command of him who _takes_ the just account [^4].

5\. Moreover, the bridge becomes a broad bridge for the righteous, as much as the height of nine spears (nî<i>z</i>akŏ)—and the length of those which they carry is each separately three reeds [^5]\--; and <span id="p49"><sup><small>[ p. 49 ]</small></sup></span> it becomes a narrow bridge _for_ the wicked, even unto a resemblance to the edge of a razor. 6. And he who is of the righteous passes over the bridge, and a worldly similitude of the pleasantness of his path upon it is when thou shalt eagerly and unweariedly walk in the golden-coloured spring, and _with_ the gallant (hû-<i>k</i>îr [^6]) body and sweet-scented blossom in the pleasant skin of that maiden [^7] spirit, the price of goodness. 7. He who is of the wicked, as he places a footstep _on_ to the bridge, on account of affliction (siparîh) and _its_ sharpness, falls from the middle of the bridge, and rolls _over_ head-foremost. 8. And the unpleasantness of his path to hell is in similitude such as the worldly _one_ in the midst of that stinking _and_ dying existence (hastân), there where numbers of the sharp-pointed darts (tê<i>z</i>ŏ mûk dû<i>g</i>ŏ) are planted [^8] out inverted and point upwards, and they come unwillingly running; they shall not allow _them_ to stay behind, _or_ to make delay. 9. So much greater _than_ the worldly similitude is that pleasantness and unpleasantness unto the souls, as such as is fit for the spirit is greater than _that_ fit for the world. <span id="p50"><sup><small>[ p. 50 ]</small></sup></span> 1\. The twenty-first question is that which you ask thus: When he who is righteous passes away, who has performed much worship of the sacred beings, and many duties and good works, do the spirit of creation, the spirit of the _sacred_ ceremony (ya<i>z</i>isnŏ) and religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, the water, earth, plants, and animals, make complaint unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, owing to the passing away of him who is righteous, and is it distressing to them when he goes out from the world, or how is it?

2\. The reply is this, that _as to_ him who is of the righteous, in _his_ transit of worldly pain in passing away, and also after passing away to the passage onwards [^9] which is his limit (stâr) still in the perplexing account, and, after the account, in his own joy, and in what _occurs_ when his gossips (hamvâ<i>k</i>ân) in the world—by whom the spiritual beings are also not unrecognised; _nor_ his position unknown—are in worldly demeanour downcast and grieving, _on all these occasions_ [^10] _his_ thoughts, procuring forgiveness, are about the sacred beings. 3. And the spirit of creation, _and_ the good spirit of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, which are in the worldly _existence_\—of which [^11] also, in the world, that righteous _one_ is a praiser, an employer, a manager, a protection, and a forbearing friend—shall make an outcry to <span id="p51"><sup><small>[ p. 51 ]</small></sup></span> the creator about him who is righteous, who is _away_ from worldly protection, _also_ for the granting of a promoter of forbearance, and _for_ a restorer (â<i>v</i>ôr<i>d</i>âr) of what is extorted [^12]; _likewise_ a petition about the compensatory concomitants as to his new protection and disposer.

4\. And the almighty creator responds, _and_ allots a teacher [^13] for smiting the fiend, for the satisfaction of the righteous, _and_ for the protection of the good creatures. 5. As it is said, that in every age a high-priest of the religion and _his_ managing of the creatures are made manifest, in whom, in that age, the protection of the creatures and the will of the sacred beings are progressing.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (48:1) The <i>K</i>akâ<i>d</i>\-i Dâitîk of Bd. XII, 7.

[^2]: (48:2) The primeval home of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship (see Vend. I, 5, 6), which the Bundahi<i>s</i> places ‘in the direction of Âdarbî<i>g</i>ân;’ it is also stated to contain the Dâîtîk or Dâîtih river (which must not be confounded with the Dâîtih peak) and the Dâra<i>g</i>a river (on whose bank Zaratû<i>s</i>t‘s father is said to have dwelt), and to have been the scene of Zaratû<i>s</i>t’s first promulgation of the religion (Bd. XX, 13, 32, XXIX, 12, XXXII, 3). Its winter is likewise described as both long and cold (Vend. I, 8-12, Bd. XXV, 11, 16), which is the case in Âdarbî<i>g</i>ân.

[^3]: (48:3) See Chap. XX, 3.

[^4]: (48:4) The angel Rashnû.

[^5]: (48:5) The nine spears of three reeds each, in length, making up the p. 49 twenty-seven reeds mentioned in § 3. As the reed appears to have been about 4 feet 8 inches (see Chap. XLIII, 5, note), the width of the bridge is supposed to be about 126 feet, and the length of a spear is taken as 14 feet.

[^6]: (49:1) So in the MSS., but hû-<i>k</i>ihar, ‘handsome,’ is more probable.

[^7]: (49:2) Reading kanîkŏ, instead of the kanâkŏ of the MSS., as there can be no allusion to the evil spirit here. The reference is to a good conscience, which is symbolised by the handsome maiden who is supposed to meet the righteous soul on its way to heaven (see Chap. XXIV, 5).

[^8]: (49:3) Assuming that â<i>g</i>zast is equivalent to Pers. â<i>g</i>ast. The allusion seems to be to a form of torturing punishment (running upon ground studded with sharp points) well known to the author.

[^9]: (50:1) The <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, near which the soul's account is rendered.

[^10]: (50:2) The sentence is clear enough in Pahlavi, but too involved to be readily understood in English without these extra words.

[^11]: (50:3) The worldly existences which those spirits represent.

[^12]: (51:1) These latter clauses of the outcry refer to their own wants, and the necessity of providing some one to take the place of the deceased; but the final petition seems to be for the deceased himself.

[^13]: (51:2) The word maybe either farhakhtâkŏ, ‘preparing, educating,’ or firî<i>s</i>tâkŏ, ‘sending, deputing,’ and must be used as a substantive.
