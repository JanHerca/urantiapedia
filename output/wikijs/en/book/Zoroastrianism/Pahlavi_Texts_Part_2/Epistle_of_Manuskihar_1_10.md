## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. CHAPTER X.

1\. And _as to_ the many other _matters to_ which an explicit reply is not written by me—be it the determinableness of it, be it, the flow of _inward_ prayer [^1], be it the pouring of the water, and likewise the rest which is written _to_ me—the statements, when de-liberation and conjecture about such arrangements become needful, are not _to be made_ unto the multitude, but _unto_ the priestly at once [^2]. 2. And this much, also, which is written by me is on this account [^3], _that_ when a writing has come to you which is the purport of my re-explanation, _and it has_ seemed that it is written after _well_\-weighed (sakhtakŏ) observations [^4], even so they _would_ cause _some_ of those of good desires to understand, who are thoughtful friends of the soul _and_ observers of <span id="p317"><sup><small>[ p. 317 ]</small></sup></span> _well_\-weighed _ideas_, in whose heart and mind, owing to that _other_ writing [^5], the existence of doubtfulness may fully remain; and, owing to that, this much re-explanation _has_, indeed, seemed to me good.

3\. And then the desire [^6] to sprinkle [^7] in many modes is also an incorrect presentation [^8], on which same subject there is this in consideration, that afterwards, peradventure, the same priestly man [^9] by whom it is written _may_ come—whose assured wisdom [^10] may the angels make steadfast! _and_ whom my approaching causing a purifier to travel for _various_ quarters _has_ occasioned to write it—so that while they are, therefore, awed by him, and shall provide more completely for use the full measure of water _and_ bull's urine, the complete words of the Avesta, _and_ other proper rites, they shall proceed more approvably. 4. And if _it be_ even not auxiliary for the same purpose (âhanŏ) _that it was_ written by him—except, indeed, through consideration of its details—no reason for a writing of that kind is to be assigned.

5\. But if for the reason _it was_ written by him _it be_ manifest as an existence which is very little threatening, then I consider his opinion, which is in his decree, not so perplexing; and, till [^11] now, the perplexing consideration _was_ more particularly as <span id="p318"><sup><small>[ p. 318 ]</small></sup></span> to that, when, owing to the great learning thereof to be seen by me, this was not doubtful, that _as to_ the great opinion of the world _about_ the existing law of the profession of the priesthood, _and_ the practice of all those of the good religion of the realm, they should make a decree only by the deliberation of me and other priestly men _and_ religious observers [^12]. 6. For if even he retorts a further statement [^13] as to the appointed observance, _its_ origin is then also a propagation from the diverse teachings of those great high-priests of those of the primitive faith, _who_ were they _who_ have been formerly great.

7\. On account of the depth and much intricacy of the religion they mention many opinions _and_ well-considered decrees _which were_ likewise formed devoid of uniformity, _and_ the utterance _of_ the different opinions of the priests is with the reciters of the Nasks; but even among themselves the most supremely just high-priests were of a different opinion, different judgment, different teaching, different interpretation, and different practice only in the peace, mutual friendship, and affection which they had together. 8. Just as that even which was prominent about these chief priests (magôpatânŏ magôpatŏ), whose names _were_ Âtûrŏ-Frôbagvindâ<i>d</i> and Âtûrŏ-bû<i>g</i>êd, who have been, each separately, the high-priest of the realm of the true religion and the scholar of the age. <span id="p319"><sup><small>[ p. 319 ]</small></sup></span> 9\. To many, when an opinion is afterwards so obtained, _pertaining_ to the high-priests _in_ the spiritual _existence_ [^14], _it_ is as is said about Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân, that ‘the first time when the arch-angels are seen by him, the Spîtamân, _it_ is then supposed by him that they are Aîndar, Sârû, Nâki<i>s</i>îyyâ, Tâûîrê<i>v</i>, _and_ Zâîrî<i>k</i> [^15], who are most mighty [^16].’ 10. From such as those the decree and its original perversity (bûn-gâ<i>s</i>tîkŏîh) and scanty preservativeness are so written _and_ prepared, and afterwards, also, your opinion is that way irritated by the habit of good thinking—of which there is so much manifest [^17] from those of the primitive faith and the high-priests—because even its words and those written with _it, and_ the completeness of will _and_ religion which is written, inclined the mind _away_ from the teaching of the high-priests.

11\. But as the same decree, _or_ that which is resembling the same decree [^18], is appointed (vakhtŏ) <span id="p320"><sup><small>[ p. 320 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ specially decided, and is not to be accepted _from_ him, and the operation is not to be performed thereby, its position is then to be considered, _by_ those steadfast _in_ the practice of the pre-eminent religion, with the most advanced understanding and discernment, which are the thought of its true station in the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers. 12. And other religious decrees, intelligently preservative of the soul, which are made known _and_ declared from the teaching of truthful high-priests of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, are to be suitably accepted _and_ fulfilled. 13. And since this opinion (dâstakŏ) of mine is, moreover, from the writing of Afarg, even about the preservation of different interpretations and different teachings, not specially owing to unobtainable statements of this shattered [^19] religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, nor even _to_ distress through simultaneous strife, but owing to the desire of true opinions which _has_ existed, there is safety abundantly, but temporarily, from the scribbling of the opposing, partial, and injurious writing of that priestly man [^20].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (316:2) Reading vâ<i>g</i>\-rê<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏîh; but J omits the first letter, and thereby converts the word into aparda<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîh, ‘want of leisure.’

[^2]: (316:3) J has merely ‘the statements are when deliberation and conjecture become at once needful.’

[^3]: (316:4) Reading hanâ râî, as in J; the other MSS. have hanâ lâ.

[^4]: (316:5) Or, perhaps, ‘strict observations’ here, and ‘strict observers’ further on.

[^5]: (317:1) To which he is replying.

[^6]: (317:2) Reading adîn gâm, but this is doubtful.

[^7]: (317:3) The Huz. verb zerîkûntanŏ, ‘to sprinkle,’ is not found in the glossaries, but is readily traceable to Chald. ו ?Zְ?Rַ?Q.

[^8]: (317:4) Reading arashnîkŏ-<i>k</i>ŏ-dahi<i>s</i>nîh.

[^9]: (317:5) Meaning his brother, Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam.

[^10]: (317:6) The usual Pahlavi phrase for the Av. âsnô khratus or instinctive wisdom (see Dd. XL, 3).

[^11]: (317:7) Assuming that val stands for va<i>l</i>.

[^12]: (318:1) Implying that the more learning there is manifest in an erroneous teaching, the more necessary it is to submit it to careful examination.

[^13]: (318:2) Reading frâ<i>g</i>ŏ va<i>k</i> patŏ-yekavîmûnê<i>d</i>, and assuming that the last word stands for patŏ-îstê<i>d</i>.

[^14]: (319:1) That is, such as have passed away.

[^15]: (319:2) These are the last five of the arch-demons who are the special opponents of the archangels, being corruptions of the Avesta names I<i>n</i>dra, Sauru, N<i>a</i>unghaithya, Tauru, and Zairi<i>k</i>a (see Bd. I, 27). The name of the first arch-demon, Akôman, is omitted here, probably by the mistake of some copyist, as six names are wanted to make up the number of the archangels exclusive of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> himself.

[^16]: (319:3) J continues as follows:--‘“of the demons.” 10. Written with the wretchedness (vakhârîh) and savageness of such as those, the oppressiveness and disaster of a decree of that description, and its original perversity,’ &c. (as in the text).

[^17]: (319:4) In the decree, which was so written as to appear to be directly derived from the teachings of the commentators, but, at the same time, so warped their statements as to lead astray. Hence, it might be compared to the conversion of an archangel into an arch-fiend through a mental hallucination, as mentioned in § 9.

[^18]: (319:5) J omits these last eight words.

[^19]: (320:1) Reading hanâ giring, but it can also be read ân adarog, ‘that undeceitful.’

[^20]: (320:2) Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam.
