## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXI.

1\. _As to_ the seventieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus; Is anything which happens <span id="p215"><sup><small>[ p. 215 ]</small></sup></span> unto men through fate or through action, is exertion destiny _or_ without destiny, _and_ does anything devoid of destiny happen unto men, or what way is it? 2. _As to_ that which they say, that, when a man turns unto sinfulness, they ordain anew a new death [^1]; _as to_ that which they say, _that_ anything which happens unto men is a work of the moon [^2], and every benefit is connected with the moon, and the moon bestows _it_ upon worldly beings; and _as to_ what way the moon _does_ this, and bestows all benefits, order _some one_ to decide the literal explanation of how and what way it is, by the will of the sacred beings.

3\. The reply is this, that the high-priests [^3] have said thus, that there are _some_ things through destiny, and there are _some_ through action; and _it_ is thus fully decided by them, that life, wife, and child, authority and wealth are through destiny, and the righteousness and wickedness of priesthood, warfare, and husbandry are through action. 4. And this, too, is thus said by them, that that which is not <span id="p216"><sup><small>[ p. 216 ]</small></sup></span> destined for a man in the world does not happen; _and_ that which is destined, be it owing to exertion, will come forward, be it through sinfulness _or_ slothfulness he is injured by it. 5. That which will come forward owing to exertion is such as _his_ who goes to a meeting of happiness, or the sickness _of_ a mortal who, owing to sickness, dies early [^4]; _and_ he who through sinfulness and slothfulness is thereby injured is such as _he_ who would wed no wife, _and_ is certain that no child of his is born, _or_ such as he who gives _his_ body unto slaughter, and life is injured by his living.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (215:1) This reference is to a phrase in the Pahl. commentary on Vend. V, 33, which commentary contains a good many of the statements made in this chapter, excepting those relating to the moon. The reading aôsh, ‘death,’ given by K35, is probably more correct than aûba<i>s</i>, ‘for him,’ given by our modern MSS. of the Vendidâ<i>d</i>; but M14 has amended it, and states ‘then many new things are ordained by it for him.’

[^2]: (215:2) Assuming that vidanâg, ‘time,’ stands for bidanâg, the Huz. of mâh, which means both ‘month’ and ‘moon.’ In the following phrases the word mâh is used.

[^3]: (215:3) It may be noted that most Pahlavi writers, when quoting the Pahlavi commentaries on the Vendidâ<i>d</i> (as the author is doing here) or any other Nask, speak of them merely as the utterances of the high-priests, and reserve the term dînô, ‘revelation,’ for the Avesta itself; thus showing that belief in the inspiration of the Pahlavi translations of the Avesta is a very modern idea.

[^4]: (216:1) M14 has ‘which comes forward owing to sickness.’
