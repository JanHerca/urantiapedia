## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XCII.

1\. _As to_ the ninety-first question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: Of waters and rivers, and whatever water is good, is Arekdvisûr [^1] the greatest (mas), or _some_ other water or good river; and, again, where is the place of Arekdvisûr?

2\. The reply is this, that _it is_ the water of Arekdvisûr; and _what has_ gushed from Arekdvisûr is as large a mass as all the water in the world [^2] except the Arvand [^3]; within the wide-formed ocean [^4] _it_ is dominant over the thousand cascades (pashan) _and_ thousand lakes [^5] of the waters, and its place is most _renowned_ throughout the spheres. 3. There flows the water of Arekdvisûr in a forest, the source of all seeds, whereby the species _which_ plants possess are assimilated (aê<i>d</i>ûnagî<i>d</i>ŏ) by it, _and_ healing existences of all kinds are mingled _with it_ from medicinal plants. 4. The abundant power of the <span id="p263"><sup><small>[ p. 263 ]</small></sup></span> coming of healing to the purifying water is like the nature of the existences which it acquires, _and_ then the nature which it thus acquires for its own the water draws up by the power which is drawing water to itself.

5\. The water of Arekdvisûr is on Albûr<i>z</i> [^6], and flows even to the summit of the star station during the coming of the healing of purification, even unto Hûkhîr the lofty [^7], all-gorgeous _and_ brilliant; thence _its_ flowing is effected [^8] into the lake of a summit to Albûr<i>z</i>, Mount [Aûshin<i>d</i>ûm](errata_htm.html) [^9], which is in the middle of the wide-formed ocean. 6. And from that flowing of waters that destined river, the utter destruction of every night, comes on in the light of a dawn; by the sprinkling of spray (pash-pashanŏ) it extends through the seven regions _of the earth_, and from it arise the growth of their plants and the coming of the healing of purification; that which is called a drop (srî<i>s</i>k) of the primeval creatures _being_ a particle (aham) of water of the bulk of a horse [^10].
