## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. The twenty-second question is that which you ask thus: When they shall snatch forth the life from the body of man how does it depart?

2\. The reply is this, that _it_ is said _to be_ in resemblance such as when the redness is drawn up out of a fire; for when the inflammable _material_ of a fire is burnt, _and has_ remained without glowing [^1], <span id="p52"><sup><small>[ p. 52 ]</small></sup></span> and when it does not obtain new inflammable _material_, or extinguishing _matter_ (nî<i>z</i>âyi<i>s</i>nîk) comes upon _it_, its redness _and_ heat then depart from it [^2]; the life, too, on the departure of the breath (vâ<i>d</i>ŏ va<i>s</i>akîh), does not stay in the body, _but in_ like manner departs.

3\. _To_ a like purport the high-priests of the religion _have_ also said this, that mortals _and_ men by listening [^3] perceive the time when the spirits shall put a noose (band) on the neck [^4]; when his time _has_ fully come _one_ then conducts him with a companion (pavan ham-bar) [^5], and at his falling are the place of death [^6] and cause of death; and _having_ made lethargy (bûshâsp) deliver him up, and terrified his fever (tapŏ), death (aôsh) seizes decrepitude (zarmân) _away_ from him [^7].

4\. The strength in those intrusted _with him_, and the good proceedings _and_ pursuit of means which remain behind [^8], giving them strength, are the determination <span id="p53"><sup><small>[ p. 53 ]</small></sup></span> (vi<i>k</i>îr) which is their own inward physician. 5. And should it be a passing _away_ (vi<i>d</i>arg) which obtains no light, and on account of their disquietudes _they have_ gone to the understanders of remedies for strength for the remedial duties, and the way is closed, he proceeds with insufficiency of means [^9]. 6. And the soul of the body, which is the master of _its_ house (ka<i>d</i>ak khû<i>d</i>âî), _along_ with the animating life, _goes_ out of the impotent body to the immortal souls [^10], as a wise master of a house goes out of a foreign (anîrânŏ) house to a residence of the good worship.

7\. _It was_ also told to the ancient learned that life (khayâ) is where there is a living spirit within the soul's body, which is connected with the soul [^11], as much as a development (<i>s</i>arîtûntanŏ) of the body, and is the life (zîvandakîh) of the soul of a body of _one_ passed _away_.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (51:3) Reading abarî<i>s</i> (compare Pers bar<i>z</i>, ‘splendour’), or it may be abarâkh, ‘sparkless,’ if barkh, ‘a spark,’ be a pure Persian word, which is doubtful.

[^2]: (52:1) M14 and J omit the remainder of the sentence.

[^3]: (52:2) Reading <i>s</i>invi<i>s</i>nŏ, but by omitting a stroke we should have dâni<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘knowledge.’

[^4]: (52:3) Of a person at the point of death. The demon of death, Astôvîdâ<i>d</i> is supposed to cast a noose around the necks of the dead to drag them to hell, which only the righteous can throw off (see Bd. III, 21, 22).

[^5]: (52:4) That is, the dying man must be conveyed by more than one person, for fear of such contamination by the demon of corruption (at the time of death) as would require the tedious Bareshnûm ceremonial of purification (see Sls. II, 1, 6-8).

[^6]: (52:5) And, therefore, the place where his body will rise again at the resurrection (see Sls. XVII, 11-14).

[^7]: (52:6) Lethargy, fever, and decrepitude are considered as fiends, but are dispossessed by the mightier demon of death. M14 and J mention ‘lethargy,’ but omit the after part of the sentence.

[^8]: (52:7) Alluding probably to the ceremonies to be ordered and performed by the survivors (see Chap. XXVIII, 6, Sls. XVII, 2-6).

[^9]: (53:1) That is, when there are doubts about the fate of the soul, and the survivors can obtain no satisfactory assurances from the priesthood, the soul has to proceed to the other world without suitable provision for its happiness.

[^10]: (53:2) The MSS. have ‘soul.’

[^11]: (53:3) M14 and J have ‘which is the soul,’ and omit the remainder of the sentence.
