### V. FINDING A CORPSE IN THE WILDERNESS.

THE controversy between Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar and his brother, Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, of. which the Epistles of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar are the only portion extant, turned chiefly upon the meaning to be attached to Vend. VIII, 271-299 [^1], and whether the mode of purification therein detailed was a sufficient substitute, or merely a preparation, for the Bareshnûm ceremony. The following is a translation of the Pahlavi version of this passage [^2]:--

Pahl. Vend. VIII, 271. ‘O creator! how are those men purified, O righteous Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! who shall stand by a corpse, in a distant place, upon a wild spot [^3]?’

272\. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘They are purified, O righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t!’

273\. ‘But when so? \[that is, how will _such a one_ become clean?\]’

274\. ‘If a corpse-eating dog, or a corpse-eating bird, _has_ attacked that corpse, (275) _the man_ shall then purify over his own body with bull’s urine, (276) thirty times by washing forwards \[_with_ the bull's urine\], _and_ thirty times by washing over [^4], \[and <span id="p456"><sup><small>[ p. 456 ]</small></sup></span> _his_ hand shall rub over it.\] 277. Of the topmost _part_ of him is the washing over, \[that is, the washing of his head is that regarding which _there_ is a mention through this study-causing (hûshkar) exclamation.\] [^5]

278\. 'If a corpse-eating dog, or a corpse-eating bird, _has_ not attacked that corpse, (279) _he shall purify_ fifteen times by washing forwards, _and_ fifteen times by washing backwards, \[and _his_ hand shall rub over it:\]

280\. 'He shall run the first mile (hâsar) [^6]. 281: He shall then run forwards, \[when the Pa<i>n</i><i>k</i>adasa (“fifteen _times_”) shall be performed by him.\] 282. _And_ when he shall thus stop opposite any one whomsoever of the material existence [^7], he shall be prepared with a loud issue of words, (283) thus [^8]: “I have thus stood close by the body of him who is dead; I am no wisher _for it_ by thought, I am no wisher _for it_ by word, I am no wisher _for it_ by deed, \[that is, _it_ is not possible for me _to be_ as _though_ washed.\] 284. It demands purification for me, \[that is, wash me thoroughly!\]” 285. When he runs, the first he shall reach, (286) if they do not grant him purification, share one-third of that deed of his, \[that is, of all that sin, not possible for him _to bear_, except when they shall perform _his purification_, one _part_ in three is theirs at _its_ origin.\]

287\. 'He runs the second mile \[while he runs for <span id="p457"><sup><small>[ p. 457 ]</small></sup></span> _it_\]. 288. He runs, _and_ a second time he reaches _people_. 289. If they do not grant him purification, (290) they share a half [^9] of that deed of his, \[that is, of all that sin, not possible for him _to bear_, except when they shall perform _his purification_, as _it were_ a half is even for them at _its_ origin.\]

291\. 'He shall run the third mile \[while he runs for _it_\]. 292. When he runs, the third he shall reach, (293) if they do not grant him purification, share all [^10] that deed of his, \[that is, all that sin which _it_ is not possible for him _to bear_, except when they shall perform _his purification_, is ever _theirs_ at _its_ origin.\]

294\. ‘He shall then run forwards [^11]. 295. He shall thus stop opposite _some people_ of the next house, village, tribe, _or_ district, _and_ he shall be prepared with a loud issue of words, (296) thus: “I have thus stood close by the body of him who is dead; (297) I am no wisher _for it_ by thought, I am no wisher _for it_ by word, I am no wisher _for it_ by deed, \[that is, _it_ is not possible _to bear_ without washing.\] 298. It demands purification for me, \[that is, wash me thoroughly!\]” 299. If they do not grant him purification, he shall then purify over his own body with bull’s urine, _and_ also with water; thus he shall be thoroughly purified over [^12].'

\[<i>a</i>. He shall go three miles; it is not allowable to walk back to _his_ district, until he _has_ fully striven <span id="p458"><sup><small>[ p. 458 ]</small></sup></span> with three persons, and all that sin, not possible for him _to bear_, except when they shall perform _his purification_, is theirs at its origin.

<i>b</i>. When thus thoroughly washed by him_self_, his duty even then is the work frakairi frakerenao<i>d</i>, vâstrê verezyôi<i>d</i> (‘he should accomplish with perseverance, he should cultivate in the pastures [^13]); there are _some_ who would say thus: ’He is always for the performance of work, and abstinence from the ceremonies of others is for him [^14].\]

## Footnotes

[^1]: (455:1) See Sacred Books of the East, vol. iv, pp. 116-118.

[^2]: (455:2) Subject to the same observations as those detailed in p.431 n.

[^3]: (455:3) Reading pavan va<i>s</i>kar, but the MSS., by omitting a stroke, have pavan <i>s</i>ikar,‘ on the chase.’

[^4]: (455:4) So here, but ‘washing backwards’ in § 279; and in Ep. II, iv, a we find ‘upwards’ and ‘downwards,’ instead of forwards‘ and ’backwards.‘ The Pahlavi translators were evidently doubtful whether the Av. upasnât<i>e</i>ê (see Ep. II, iii, 2) meant ’washing over, backwards, or downwards.'

[^5]: (456:1) Implying that the Pahlavi translators had found the use of Av. aghrya for ‘head’ rather perplexing.

[^6]: (456:2) The hâsar was ‘a thousand steps of the two feet’ (see Bd. XXVI, s, note), and was, therefore, about an English mile.

[^7]: (456:3) That is, any human being.

[^8]: (456:4) See Ep. I, ii, 10.

[^9]: (457:1) That is, half of the two-thirds remaining with him, or one-third of the whole original trespass.

[^10]: (457:2) That is, all the remaining one-third of the original trespass.

[^11]: (457:3) See Ep. II, iii, 3.

[^12]: (457:4) What follows is a commentary, by the Pahlavi translators, on the whole passage.

[^13]: (458:1) ‘Quoted from Vend. XIX, 140, where the words ’sheep‘s food _and_ food for oxen’ are added.

[^14]: (458:2) A person so purified by himself, after vainly seeking a proper purifier, is, therefore, only fit for the ordinary labours of life, and must avoid all religious celebrations till properly purified by the Bareshnûm ceremony. This was the opinion of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, but it is based upon a Pahlavi commentary, and not upon the Avesta text, which is not clear upon this point.
