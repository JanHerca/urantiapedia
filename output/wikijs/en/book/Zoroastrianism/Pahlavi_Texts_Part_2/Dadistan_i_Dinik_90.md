## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XC.

1\. _As to_ the eighty-ninth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: Who, and how many are they who are without the religion (adînôîh) _but_ are made immortal, and for what purpose is their immortality? 2. Where is the place they, each one, possess sovereignty, and _in_ the place where they possess sovereignty are _there_ people of the good religion of every kind, or how are they; are _there_ sacred fires [^1] and appointed worship, or how is <span id="p256"><sup><small>[ p. 256 ]</small></sup></span> it; and for what purpose is each one of their sovereignties?

3\. The reply is this, that the immortal rulers of the region of glory, Khvanîras [^2], are said _to be_ seven: one is Yô<i>s</i>tô, son of Fryân  [^3]; the Avesta name of one is Yakhmâyûs<i>a</i><i>d</i> [^4], son of the same Fryân; the name of one is Fradhakh<i>s</i>tŏ, son of the Khumbîks [^5]; the name of one is Ashavazang, son of Pôrûdakhstôîh [^6]; one is the tree opposed to harm [^7]; <span id="p257"><sup><small>[ p. 257 ]</small></sup></span> one is Gôpatshah [^8]; _and_ one is Peshyôtanû [^9], who is called after the <i>K</i>îtravôkŏ-mîyânŏ [^10].

4\. The reign of Gôpatshah is over the land of Gôpatŏ [^11], coterminous with Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> [^12], on the bank (bar) of the water of the Dâîtîh [^13]; _and_ he keeps watch over the ox Hadhayã<i>s</i> [^14], through whom occurs the complete perfection of primitive man [^15]. 5. The reign of Peshyôtanû is in Kangde<i>z</i> [^16], _and_ he resides in the illustrious Kangde<i>z</i> which the noble Sîyâvash [^17] formed through his glory, _he_ who is called the erratic youth [^18] of the illustrious Kayânians. 6. And through his powerful spirit _arose_ increase of cultivation and the ruler Kaî-Khûsrôî [^19] among the highest of the mountains in the countries of <span id="p258"><sup><small>[ p. 258 ]</small></sup></span> Irân _and_ Tûrân; the purity of the sacred fire [^20] of great glory _and_ the recital of the liturgy exist there, _and_ the practice of religious rites (dînô) is provided. 7. The custom, also, of him (Peshyôtanû) and _his_ companions _and_ coadjutors (ham-bâr), in the appointed millenniums, is the great advancement of religion and good works in other quarters likewise [^21].

8\. But, secondly, _as to_ the whereabouts of the places which are theirs--just like his--of which _there_ is no disquisition by me, this also is even owing to _my_ not remembering [^22].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (255:2) Literally ‘fires of Varahrân’ (see Chap. XXXI, 7).

[^2]: (256:1) The central one of the seven regions of the earth, which is supposed to contain all the countries best known to the Iranians, and to be as large as the other six regions put together (see Bd. XI, 2-6). The name is here corrupted into Khvanâîra<i>s</i>.

[^3]: (256:2) Av. Yôi<i>s</i>tô yô Fryananãm of Âbân Yt. 81, Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 120, who had to explain ninety-nine enigmas propounded to him by the evil Akhtya. In Pâz. this name is corrupted into Gô<i>s</i>t-î Fryânô, whose explanation of thirty-three enigmas propounded by Akht the wizard, and proposal of three enigmas in his turn form the subject of a Pahlavi tale published with AV. He is not included among the immortals mentioned in Bd. XXIX, 5, 6, and Dk. (see § 8, note), but is one of those specified in Byt. II, 1.

[^4]: (256:3) No doubt, the Av. Ashem-yahmâi-u<i>s</i>ta (‘righteousness for which be blessing’) who precedes Yôi<i>s</i>tô in Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 120. He is the Asâm-î Yamâhu<i>s</i>t of Bd. XXIX, 5, who is said to reside in the district of the river Nâîvtâk; but he is not mentioned in Dk. The names Yakhmâyûs<i>a</i><i>d</i>, Fradhakh<i>s</i>tŏ, and Ashavazang are written in Pâzand, which accounts for their irregular spelling.

[^5]: (256:4) Av. Fradhâkh<i>s</i>ti Khu<i>n</i>bya of Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 138. In Dk. he is said to be ruler on the Nâîvtâk waters, but in Bd. he is called Par<i>s</i>adgâ <i>H</i><i>v</i>embya residing in the plain of Pê<i>s</i>yânsaî.

[^6]: (256:5) Av. Ashavazdang the Pourudhâkh<i>s</i>tiyan of Âbân Yt. 72, Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 112. He is the Ashavazd son of Pourudhâkh<i>s</i>t in Bd., and is said to rule in the plain of Pê<i>s</i>yânsaî in Dk.

[^7]: (256:6) The many-seeded tree, said to grow in the wide-formed ocean, and also in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, on which the Saêna bird (simurgh) is sup-posed to sit and shake off the seeds, which are then conveyed by the bird <i>K</i>amrô<i>s</i> to the waters gathered by Tî<i>s</i>tar, who rains them down on the earth with the water; hence the growth of fresh vegetation when the rainy season commences (see Rashnu Yt. 17, Bd. XXXVI, 2, XXIX, 5, Mkh. LXII, 37-42).

[^8]: (257:1) Either a title or son of Aghrêra<i>d</i>, brother of Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> of Tûr (see Bd. XXIX, 5, XXXI, 20-22). He is a righteous minotaur according to Mkh. LXII, 31-36.

[^9]: (257:2) Here written Patshâyôtanû, but he is the Peshyôtanû of Chap. XXXVII, 36.

[^10]: (257:3) The <i>K</i>atru-mîyân river in Kangde<i>z</i> (see Bd. XX, 31).

[^11]: (257:4) Which is a non-Aryan country according to Dk., but Bd. (XXIX, 5) calls it ‘the land of the S<i>a</i>ukavastân,’ and Mkh. (XLIV, 24-35, LXII, 31) places Gôpatshah in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>.

[^12]: (257:5) See Chap. XXI, 2.

[^13]: (257:6) Av. Dâitya, a river which flows out of Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> (see Bd. XX, 13).

[^14]: (257:7) See Chap. XXXVII, 99.

[^15]: (257:8) Referring either to the complete peopling of the earth by emigration on the back of this ox in ancient times, or to the immortality produced at the resurrection by tasting an elixir, of which the fat of this ox is one of the ingredients.

[^16]: (257:9) A settlement east of Persia formed, or fortified, by Sîyâvash (see Bd. XXIX, 10, Byt. III, 25).

[^17]: (257:10) See Chap. XXXVII, 36.

[^18]: (257:11) Or kang-î raftâr may mean ‘jaunty youth;’ but it is evidently an attempt to account for the name Kangde<i>z</i> as ‘the fortress of the kang (“youth”).’

[^19]: (257:12) The son of Sîyâvash (see Chap. XXXVI, 3, Bd. XXXI, 25).

[^20]: (258:1) Literally ‘fire of Varahrân.’

[^21]: (258:2) He is expected to be summoned by the angels to restore the religious rites to the world, after the conflict of the nations in a future age (see Byt. III, 25-42).

[^22]: (258:3) In the detailed account of the contents of the Sû<i>d</i>kar (or Stû<i>d</i>gar) Nask, given in the ninth book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, the latter part of its fifteenth fargar<i>d</i> is said to have been ‘on the seven immortal rulers who are produced in the region of Khvanîras, and also about the determination of their glory, and the goodness, too, of _their_ assistants and living sovereignty in both worlds. The tree opposed to harm is on Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> in the place of most excavations (frêh-nigânân?). Gôk-patŏ is in the non-Aryan countries. Peshyôtanû son of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp is in Kangde<i>z</i> of the hundred-ribbed shape (sa<i>d</i>\-dandakŏ kerpîh?), in which a myriad of the exalted, who wear black marten _fur_ (mûn sîyah samûr yakhsenund), are righteous listeners out of the retinue of Peshyôtanû son of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp. Frâ<i>d</i>akh<i>s</i>tŏ son of the mortal Khûmbîks, who is sovereign on the water of Nâîvtâk. Ashavazd son of Pôrû<i>d</i>akh<i>s</i>tŏ, who is sovereign over the most manifest among uplands, the plain, of Pê<i>s</i>inâs. Barâzd the causer of strife. And of the father-in-law’s race (kha<i>s</i>t-tômagag?) of the famous Vi<i>s</i>tâsp is _he_ who is called Kaî-Khûsrôî, who produces even an advance of thy religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, and also understands about _it; and_ who gives my good practices further blessings, so that the world maintains my doings with benedictions. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.'
  In this list of the immortal rulers of ancient times, the names of Barâzd and Kaî-Khûsrôî are substituted for those of Yô<i>s</i>tô and p. 259 Yakhmâyûs<i>a</i><i>d</i> in our text. Barâzd is the Ibairaz of Bd. XXIX, 6, and, possibly, the Av. Berezyar<i>s</i>ti of Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 101.
