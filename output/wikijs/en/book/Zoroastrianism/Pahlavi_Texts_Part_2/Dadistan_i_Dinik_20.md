## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XX.

1\. The nineteenth question is that you ask thus: To what place do the righteous and wicked [^1] go?

2\. The reply is this, that it is thus said that the souls of those passed _away and_ of the dead [^2] are three nights on earth; and the first night satisfaction comes to them from _their_ good thoughts _and_ vexation from _their_ evil thoughts, the second night _come_ pleasure from _their_ good words and discomfort _and_ punishment [^3] from _their_ evil words, and the third night _come_ exaltation from _their_ good deeds _and_ punishment from _their_ evil deeds [^4]. 3. And that third night, in the dawn, they go to the place of account _on_ Albûr<i>z</i> [^5]; the account _being_ rendered they proceed to the bridge [^6], and he who is righteous <span id="p47"><sup><small>[ p. 47 ]</small></sup></span> passes over the bridge on the ascent (lâlâîh), and if belonging to the ever-stationary (hamîstânîkŏ) [^7] he goes thither where their place is, if _along_ with an excess of good works _his_ habits are correct (frârûn-dâ<i>d</i>) _he goes_ even unto heaven (vahi<i>s</i>tô), and if _along_ with an excess of good works _and_ correct habits _he has_ chanted the sacred hymns (gâsânŏ) _he goes_ even unto the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânŏ). 4. He who is of the wicked falls from the lower end (tîh) of the bridge, or from the middle of the bridge; he falls head-foremost to hell, _and_ is precipitated (nikûnî-aîtŏ) unto that grade [^8] which is _suitable for_ his wickedness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (46:1) As K35 inserts the relative î here, some such phrase as ‘who are dead’ has probably dropped out of the Pahlavi text.

[^2]: (46:2) The Parsi books speak of the righteous dead as ‘departed,’ a term very rarely applied to the wicked (see Chap. XXXII, 4), who are nearly always said ‘to die;’ the latter verb is, however, occasionally used when speaking of the righteous. This distinction is made even in the Huzvâri<i>s</i> logograms, which express the death of the righteous by forms allied to Chald.  ?Oֲ?Bַ?R ‘he passed over,’ and the death of the wicked by forms allied to Chald.  םִ?Y?Tה ‘he died.’

[^3]: (46:3) So in all MSS., but the ‘punishment’ seems superfluous here.

[^4]: (46:4) The Avesta merely states that the soul remains three nights near the body, chanting a particular hymn, and experiencing as much pleasure or uneasiness as it had in the world (see Hn. II, 3-17, III, 3-16); and much the same account is given in AV. IV, 9-14, XVII, 2-9, Mkh. II, 114, 158-160.

[^5]: (46:5) The mountain chain which is supposed to surround the world (see Bd. XII, 3); the Av. Hara-berezaiti.

[^6]: (46:6) The <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge (see Chap. XXI, 2-7), which is said to p. 47 rest upon the Dâîtih (‘judicial’) peak, and to ‘pass over to Albûr<i>z</i> (see Bd. XII, 7). According to the Avesta (Vend. XIX, 100, 101, trans. D.) his conscience, in the form of a maiden, ’makes the soul of the righteous one go up above the Hara-berezaiti (Albûr<i>z</i>); above the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge she places it in the presence of the heavenly gods (angels) themselves.' See also AV. V, 1, 2, Mkh. II, 115.

[^7]: (47:1) The intermediate place for those not good enough for heaven and not bad enough for hell, where such souls remain in a passive, immovable state till the resurrection (see Sls. VI, 2). It is divided into two parts, according to the author, one for those nearly righteous (see Chap. XXIV, 6), and one for those nearly wicked (see Chap. XXXIII, 2).

[^8]: (47:2) Four grades of heaven and four of hell are mentioned in AV. and Mkh, (see Sls. VI, 3, note).
