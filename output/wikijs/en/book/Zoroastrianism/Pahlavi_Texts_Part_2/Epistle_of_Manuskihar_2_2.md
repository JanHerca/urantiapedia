## EPISTLE II. TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER II.

1\. I _have_ also examined that writing [^1] in detail, and _it_ is very unprepared for the remarks of the learned and those acquainted with the religion, for the sentences concocted _have_ to be divided, and the slender demonstration is disconnected (aparvandî<i>d</i>ŏ); so I consider that _it_ is not sent to be seen, as regards which such a course _would_, indeed, _be_ a cause of terror to purifiers. 2. _It_ is so written that, while on account of _that_ same terror they are very much alarmed, and are thorough in maintaining the duty of the continuance of care for water and bull's urine [^2], and _of_ the formula of the operation, they shall more fully perform _it_ as a duty provided for high-priests; even from that I am more fully of opinion that your like judgment and own concession _have_ produced this explanation.

3\. When I saw in the decree, such as that which you have written, that each time _one_ comes unto a purifier who washes _in_ such manner as is declared <span id="p332"><sup><small>[ p. 332 ]</small></sup></span> in revelation—which is evident, indeed, from _his_ existence when _he_ is a religious purifier, _and_ also from _your_ priestly lordship's knowledge of the rite; indeed, there is no use of _that_ same decree unless the scripture of revelation, likewise, be so—_he_ is to do _it with_ very strict observation, _now_, since, owing to the reception of terror by the purifiers, that preparation is evidently to produce, as regards their own disposition and movements, much harm _and_ irregularity, _and_ perplexed thoughts _among_ the people, the discredit of the decreer is generated therefrom, and it would have been more reasonable to consider the terror and doubt of the purifiers in another way.

4\. That which is so explained by you as though it would remain accomplished _and_ would be in notice—and this is written by you like as it were from a teaching of _some_ description—is not proper; because, thus, every rite in the performance of the desired operation, even by one _single_ teaching, is suitable, _which_, like the preparation for the statements of lying litigants, is very like, _but_ not correct. 5. For when there are _some_ who _have_ furthered Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh [^3] better than the teaching of Afarg [^3], _it_ is well when every single rite in the teaching is right; and _as to_ his rite _it_ is not very clear that deliverance [^4] is promoted by maintaining _it_. 6. Even on that _occasion_ when Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh _has_ mentioned threefold washing, _and_ Afarg once washing [^5], Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is the after deponent and Afarg the prior <span id="p333"><sup><small>[ p. 333 ]</small></sup></span> deponent [^6]; and, on that account, the statement is to be made as long as Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is preserved, _but_ as regards the opinion of the words of Afarg _it_ is to be maintained in a state of preservation.

7\. _As to_ that which Afarg _has_ said [^7], that ‘two purifiers are requisite,’ Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh _has_ also said that one is plenty; _and_, since the teaching of Sôshâns [^8] is similar evidence to his, as to that which is said by him, they have thus been more unanimous that when there is one it would be proper; _and_ as several high-priests have announced just the same evidence, _and_ Afarg himself _and_ other priests have been of the same opinion where _it_ is the performance of the beginning of the Vîkaya (‘exorcism’) [^9], Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is preserved. 8. Not on this account, that Afarg is more preservative [^10] through once washing, is the operation to be performed according to the teaching of Afarg, but the once washing from Afarg who is the prior deponent, _and_ the one purifier from Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh who is the most corroborated are to be accepted and to be conducted.

9\. And even the computers of the stars would make the position of the stars which exists when that of the sun _and_ moon is from the direction (min zîk) of <i>S</i>atvâharân [^11], that of Saturn from the direction <span id="p334"><sup><small>[ p. 334 ]</small></sup></span> of Avênak, and that of Mars from the direction of Pa<i>d</i>ramgôs, a position _which_ sends much good, _and_ is said _to be_ capable of undoubtedly (anârangak) bringing on maturity of strength. 10. That this is to be seen as an occurrence (<i>g</i>astŏ) is a conjunction (nazdakŏ) which is not possible [^12], because, if the conjunction of Satvâharân _be_ exact, yet, since Saturn _and_ Mars are not at _their_ conjunctions (min nazdak), its effect is not a good configuration (khûp tanû); if the conjunction of Avênak _be_ exact, yet, since the sun, moon [^13], _and_ Mars are not at their conjunctions, its effect is not good; _and_ if the conjunction of Pa<i>d</i>ramgôs be exact, yet, since the sun, moon, and Saturn are not [^14] at their conjunctions, the effect is <span id="p335"><sup><small>[ p. 335 ]</small></sup></span> not good; on account of [^15] which, in any conjunction which is not exact, they believe _it_ possible _for_ a firm mind also to accomplish this auspicious labour (sukh-var<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ), but they say the just and wise should make the decision [^16]. 11. So that this one is a very good position, because that which is truly issuing (râst-ta<i>g</i>) through the conjunction of Satvâharân, is from that mighty Satvâharân [^17], _and_ that of Satvâharân _being_ better through the conjunction of Pa<i>d</i>ramgôs, that is done [^18].

12\. You _should_ understand that of the same kind is the similitude of the three teachings, of which you _have_ written, with this similitude which I _have_ portrayed [^19] _and_ ordered to form _and_ scheme, so that you _may_ look at it more clearly, from a proper regard for your own deliverance [^20], _for_ the sharp <span id="p336"><sup><small>[ p. 336 ]</small></sup></span> intellectuality of the re-explainers of _what is_ not well-considered _in connection_ with _its_ purpose (âhankŏ), _and for_ the accumulation _of opinions_ that is steadfast in the law of the ancients _and_ orders _you_ to heed _it_. 13. For, owing to the miraculousness and pre-eminence of that [^21], he who thinks to restore the good ideas of the ancients does not himself understand the knowledge in that wisdom of the ancients, _and_ does not keep his own presumption (mînîh) lowly and teachable; much, too, which is through his own learning is declared _to be_ out of it (the law), _and_ how he orders _us_ to understand _it_ is _by_ his own opinion [^22].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (331:2) The decree of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam. a copy of which had been sent to him by the people of Sîrkân (see Ep. I, iv, 7).

[^2]: (331:3) The two liquids used in the purifying ceremony of the Bareshnûm (see App. IV).

[^3]: (332:1) See Ep. I, v, 1.

[^4]: (332:2) From pollution.

[^5]: (332:3) In Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>j</i> (see App. IV), where the threefold washing is connected with the name of Afarg, and the once washing with that of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh; but Ep. I, vi, 7—9 agrees with the statement here.

[^6]: (333:1) The words pasîmal, ‘after deponent,’ and pêsmâl, ‘prior deponent,’ are here written alike (see Ep. I, vi, 10, note).

[^7]: (333:2) In Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>b</i> (see App. IV and compare Ep. I, vi, 1-4).

[^8]: (333:3) See Ep. I, v, 1.

[^9]: (333:4) See Ep. I, vi, 6.

[^10]: (333:5) From pollution (see § 6).

[^11]: (333:6) The high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay is of opinion that the names of the three ‘directions’ mentioned in this section are the Pahlavi forms of the names of three of the lunar mansions, whose p. 334 Pâzand appellations are given in Bd. II, 3; and he identifies Satvâharân with Kahtsar, Avênak with Avdem, and Pa<i>d</i>ramgô<i>s</i> with Padêvar. The reading of all these names is, however, very uncertain. <i>S</i>atvâharân is written <i>S</i>atâharân three times out of the five occurrences of the name, and the first syllable might easily be read Gaht = Kaht, so as to correspond with the Pâzand; on the other hand, the reading <i>S</i>at corresponds with <i>S</i>ata-bhisha<i>g</i> or <i>S</i>ata-târakâ, the Sanskrit name of the 25th lunar mansion, Kahtsar. As Pâz. Avdem seems to be merely Pahl. afdûm, ‘last,’ I prefer identifying Avênak (which can also be read Avê<i>r</i>ak) with the ninth lunar mansion, Avra (Avrak in Bd. VII, 1, Avrak in Zs. VI, 1), the Sans. Â<i>s</i>leshâ. Pa<i>d</i>ramgô<i>s</i> is also written Pa<i>d</i>ramgôs twice out of the three occurrences of the name; its identification with Padêvar makes it the first lunar mansion, the Sans. A<i>s</i>vinî. The aspect of the heavens, therefore, which is here mentioned as very auspicious, has the sun and new moon in the latter part of Aquarius, Saturn in the first part of Aries, and Mars in the latter part of Cancer, that is, twice as far from Saturn as the latter is from the sun and moon.

[^12]: (334:1) That is, it very rarely happens; as rarely as the exact agreement of three different commentators, whom these three conjunctions are intended to represent.

[^13]: (334:2) Reading mit<i>r</i>ô mâh, instead of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh.

[^14]: (334:3) The MSS. omit lâ, ‘not,’ by mistake.

[^15]: (335:1) Reading râî, as in J, instead of the lâ, ‘not,’ of K35 and BK.

[^16]: (335:2) That is, the circumstances are too unpropitious for any one to come to a decision without consulting those who are better qualified to judge, as is also the case when commentators disagree.

[^17]: (335:3) Reading min zak rabâ <i>S</i>atvâharân, but this is doubtful, because K35 has min rabâ âharân with zak <i>S</i>at written above min rabâ; BK has min zak <i>S</i>atŏ (or dâ<i>d</i>ŏ) rabâ âharân (or khârân), which is merely reading the same characters in a different order; while J omits most of the doubtful phrase, having merely min zak-î, which, with the alteration of râst-ta<i>g</i> into râsttar, changes the meaning into the following:--‘because that which is through the conjunction of Satvâharân is more correct than that of Satvâharân, _and_ that which is through the conjunction of Pa<i>d</i>ramgo<i>s</i>, that is done.’

[^18]: (335:4) Or ‘that remains the effect.’

[^19]: (335:5) Reading nî<i>s</i>ânînî<i>d</i>ŏ; K35 and BK omit the first letter so as to convert the word into dîhânînî<i>d</i>ŏ, which might mean ‘presented.’

[^20]: (335:6) From pollution. There is some temptation to use the word ‘salvation’ for bû<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>n, but this would introduce ideas that were, no doubt, foreign to the author's mind.

[^21]: (336:1) The ancient law, as contained in the difficult language of the Avesta.

[^22]: (336:2) That is, commentators are apt to attribute to the scriptures many opinions which really originate in themselves.
