## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XLIV.

1\. _As to_ the forty-third question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: _There is_ a man who is super-intending (avar-mândakakŏ) and skilful, in whom great skill as regards religion is provided, and the high-priest‘s duty and officiating priest’s duty (magôpatîh) are performed by him; or they are not performed by him, but in him great skill as regards <span id="p146"><sup><small>[ p. 146 ]</small></sup></span> religion is provided. 2. In a place of _that_ district there is no one who rightly knows the commentary _and_ ‘the proper _and_ improper [^1],’ so that he comes forth into a place of such decay (sapakhân); _and_ the people of the district--who constantly order all the religious rites (dînô [^2]) of many sacred ceremonies from any poor _man_ of the various persons from other districts whose skill and superintending are not _like_ his, but they constantly come _to_ that district--shall constantly receive _from him_ all the many religious rites and many sacred ceremonies. 3. _And_ that man, who is revered and skilful, proceeds not undejectedly (lâ ana<i>s</i>kandîhâ) and bashfully _to_ his own superintending position, the position of the religion and position of the skill which are his; he does not demand any employment in the district or any award (dînâ) from the district, and does not know how to provide any other employment or award, in which there would be _any_ fitness for him, 4. Are the people of the district--on account of the skill and activity which that man has exercised in religion, due to the performance of all the religious rites and sacred ceremonies which they constantly order-- <span id="p147"><sup><small>[ p. 147 ]</small></sup></span> thereupon to prepare that man a stipend (bâhar) [^3], and is it necessary for them to give a stipend to that man, or how is it necessary to act; and is ‘it necessary for them to collect _it_ for him, or not? 5. And of the much advantage of all the religious rites and work is it necessary to speak thus ’Until the _time_ that thou hadst come it was not possible for us to order except of him who is inferior to thee,' or how is _it_ to be done? 6. Is it necessary to collect a stipend for him on account of the benefit and reasoning thought (vîrmatŏ) on other subjects, of which _he was_ the means, or how is it necessary _for_ the superintendent _of_ our people to collect such stipend of skill, position, and religion?

7\. The reply is this, that a man of such description as written _above_, and superintending the exercise of skill and provision of ability, is very worthy of a stipend and courtesy (khûpîh); also, through good management of all religious rites _and_ the ceremony of the sacred beings, _he_ is very confident in any uncertainty. 8. Therefore it is necessary to consider that he manages more openly and better than those whose skill and ability are not _like_ his; and also as regards stipend and reasoning thought, owing to the worthiness of the ceremony of the sacred beings, his are more whose skill, ability, and activity in religion are greater. 9. And _as to_ a man who is as written _above_\--when all those religious rites and ceremonies are well-managed by him, and his repeated direction and right continuance of proper duties are an accumulation of his own reasoning <span id="p148"><sup><small>[ p. 148 ]</small></sup></span> thought and great capability, and are ordered of him with great solicitude--_one_ is also to consider him a stipendiary [^4] thereby, and a thriving acquirement of ample reasoning thought. 10. And _as to_ him, moreover, who is less skilled than he, _and_ of inferior position, by as much as he is not _so_ worthy, _his_ custom is therefore to produce a want of himself again.

II. But he who _has_ much skill should have [^5] a great stipend, and he of medium ability should have [^5] a medium _one_, he _having_ less means of benefiting worthily, maturely, and necessarily. 12. And the value is as it is said in revelation thus: ‘The stipend they should announce to him who is an upholder of religion is two shares, _and_ to him who is mediocre _only_ one, to him whose lot is inferior.’

13\. That man is a master _and_ high-priest [^6] whose usage also (âîn-î<i>k</i>ŏ) is wise, and in ability, goodness, and skill is the best of _those of_ the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, which is the religion of wise upholders. 14. And the exercise of his religious disposition--originally possessing a religious stipend--which they shall order of him in _that_ place, and that _of_ the other worthy _ones and_ applicants in the place and coming applying to the place, as much <span id="p149"><sup><small>[ p. 149 ]</small></sup></span> as it is worth _and_ happens _to be_ their own want, _one_ is to altogether thoroughly well consider for him. 15. Good destiny is not fulfilled by granting _to_ those applying, _but_ through forward ability, the forward, kind-hearted [^7], _and_ extreme skill provided, _and_ grand position he is worthy of much stipend, _and_ it is important to make _them_ stipendiary in their own gradation of applying. 16. For the observance of moderation _and_ the granting of applications are mutually destructive, _and_ it is discriminatively said that the high-priest <i>G</i>âmâsp of the Hvôvas [^8] considered, in that mode, the much skill of that good superintendent _being_ without a stipend _as_ not disproportionate, _but_ most justly very moderate.

17\. Moreover, to collect _for_ all except for one skilful _man_, and to provide a stipend _for_ any other applicants, is not right; and the limits should be [^9] moderate, for each one really shares the moderate apportionments according to his own want, apart even from the sacred ceremony. 18. But to collect for such a man, who _has_ kind-heartedly superintended by rule during reasoning thought, is a greater good work than to approve even him _who_ is superintending much more authoritatively. 19. And he who _has_ himself requested is to obtain everything last; for, except _in_ that _case_ when a virtuous doer _has_ in any <span id="p150"><sup><small>[ p. 150 ]</small></sup></span> mode begged a livelihood [^10] _and_ is not capable _of earning it_\--so that something even of the righteous gifts [^11] of clothing is begged by him--to live in idleness is not the way to be assisted; _but_ he who _has_ not himself requested, and is wise, is to beg a suit of clothes (rakht-hanâ).

20\. They give to the good provider of gifts much praise, _and_ for the preservation of the perfect giver are many religious friends [^12], _and_ the position of the upholders of religion [^13]; so it is necessary to give, _and_ to consider _it_ as provided for the great female whom revelation greatly celebrates [^14], that patron spirit (ahû) connected with religion, as it is said that in the opinion of Hûmân [^15], the high-priest, the propitious religion is, as _it were_, the way of saving their souls [^16]. <span id="p151"><sup><small>[ p. 151 ]</small></sup></span> 21\. About upholders of religion, and a more particular rule how the lawful computation should be for glorifying with moderation, a chief of the priests [^17] _has_ spoken thus: ‘Shouldst thou be our father in wealthiness, I am thy protector in body, _and_ thou becomest thy protector in soul [^18].’

22\. The same collection [^19] is the way of the friends of religion for begging from the upholders of religion the preservation of the soul, _and_ for well considering, extremely gracefully _and_ fully reverently, the advantage _and_ pleasure of the position [^20] of the upholders of religion, so that they shall properly collect for the preservation of souls by the mode of going to collect thoroughly with great gain.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (146:1) From this it would appear that‘ a treatise called ’Shâyast Lâ-shâyast' existed a thousand years ago, which probably bore some resemblance to Sls., the work which now bears the same name.

[^2]: (146:2) The words hamâk dînô, translated ‘all the religious rites’ both here and elsewhere, are a technical term which (as I am informed by Dastûr Peshotanji Behramji, the high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay) is applied to ‘those obligatory religious rites and festivals that every Parsi is bound to observe by performing certain ceremonies, in his or her name, with the assistance of priests engaged for the purpose. These rites and festivals include the Rapithvan, the Gâhâmbârs, the Fravardîgân, the monthly festivals, &c.’

[^3]: (147:1) Literally ‘a share’ of the produce of the district, analogous to tithes.

[^4]: (148:1) Literally ‘a shareholder.’

[^5]: (148:2) Assuming that the adverbial suffix -îhâ may he taken here (as it can be probably in all cases) as the Pâz. conditional form hâê of the verb ‘to be,’ equivalent to the more usual forms aê, âe, and the Huz. hômanâe (see Chap. XLVIII, 23).

[^6]: (148:3) Or, ra<i>d</i> dastôbar may mean ‘an awarding high-priest,’ as he is called ra<i>d</i>, ‘master, chief,’ in virtue of his power of sentencing sinners and governing the religious body, and he is called dastôbar, ‘upholder of customs,’ in virtue of his control over rites and ceremonies.

[^7]: (149:1) Literally ‘good-hearted.’

[^8]: (149:2) The Av. <i>G</i>âmâspa Hvôgva (or Hvôva) of Yas. XLV, 17, L. 18, Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 103. He was high-priest and prime minister of Kai-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp; but probably the opinion of some much later <i>G</i>âmâsp is here erroneously attributed to him, much in the same way as the comparatively modern Book of Enoch is attributed to Enoch, ‘the seventh from Adam,’ in Jude, 14.

[^9]: (149:3) Reading hâê instead of -îhâ, as in § 11.

[^10]: (150:1) M14 has zîvi<i>s</i>nŏ, and K35 has zîvandân.

[^11]: (150:2) Charitable donations given to the priesthood and poor for the purpose of acquiring religious merit on certain solemn occasions; they often consist of clothing, and are then supposed to furnish the giver, or the person in whose name they are given with garments in the other world after the resurrection (see Bd. XXX, 28).

[^12]: (150:3) The angels who assist his soul after death, such as Srôsh, Mit<i>r</i>ô, Rashnû, Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i>, and the good Vâê (see Chaps. XIV, 3, 4, XXX, 2-4).

[^13]: (150:4) That is, he will occupy the same grade in heaven as the priesthood.

[^14]: (150:5) Referring to the maiden spirit supposed to meet the good soul after death and to conduct it over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge to heaven (see Chaps. XXIV, 5, XXXVII, 117). She is described in Vend. XIX, 98-101, and more fully in Hn. II, 22-32 and the later Pahlavi works. Her beauty is said to be proportional to the religious merit of the soul, and she is here identified with the ahû or patron spirit.

[^15]: (150:6) Probably some one nearly contemporary with the author, such as Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i> son of Hêmî<i>d</i> (see Bd. XXXIII, II), who is called hû-manô, ‘well-meaning,’ and styled ‘the leader of the people of the good religion’ in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> (III, ccccxiii).

[^16]: (150:7) The maiden spirit, being developed by religious actions, is p. 151 called the soul‘s ’own religion‘ in AV. IV, 23; it is, therefore, that spirit’s assistance which is probably meant here, when speaking of religion saving the soul.

[^17]: (151:1) A môbad of môbads.

[^18]: (151:2) Meaning that the wealthy man can easily protect his own soul by a proper expenditure of his wealth on good works. The connection of this with the first part of the sentence is rather obscure.

[^19]: (151:3) Mentioned in §§ 17, 18.

[^20]: (151:4) In heaven (see § 20). To induce the laity to collect ample property for paying the priesthood they are promised a share of the priest's happiness in heaven.
