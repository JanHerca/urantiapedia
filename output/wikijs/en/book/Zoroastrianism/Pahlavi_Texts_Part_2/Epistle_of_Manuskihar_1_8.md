## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. CHAPTER VIII.

1\. _As to_ that which is written [^3], that it is declared in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm _Nask_ [^4], that the consecrated bull‘s <span id="p310"><sup><small>[ p. 310 ]</small></sup></span> urine, when it becomes fetid, is to be stirred up (ba<i>r</i>â agâr<i>d</i>ŏîni<i>s</i>nŏ), _and_ they should not carry _it_ forth so to the fire, so that the stench extends to the fire; because, if that stench extends to the fire, on account of the moisture _and_ through carrying bodily refuse (hîgar) [^1] on and forth to the fire, it overwhelms it; that is taught _in_ like manner lest, and owing to what is said, it then seemed to one that the bodily refuse and pollution of fetid bull’s urine is on account of the stench. 2. But it is proper to observe it more fully mindfully, perfectly completely, _and_ with better understanding, because that which is said by it, that the carrying of bodily refuse forth to the fire overwhelms _it_, is not on account of the pollution of the bull‘s urine, but the proportion of the sin through this; so that it becomes the origin of as much sin for him as that pollution of the bull’s urine; but the stench, on account of moisture, is like _him_ even who shall bring clean _and_ purified water into the fire, _and_ thereby becomes sinful [^2] <span id="p311"><sup><small>[ p. 311 ]</small></sup></span> 3\. This, too, is a saying, that the proportion of the sin is mentioned not on account of the pollution of the bull's urine; it is said _to be_ a counterpart even of that _which_ is declared of the care of the _flesh of the_ ass and pig, so that when they shall now carry unto the fire more than the proportion which is ordered, it overwhelms _it_ through carrying bodily refuse forth to the fire, and even then that flesh, investigated as to purity, is mentioned as a supply for the season-festival [^1].

4\. The fetid bull's urine is itself likewise prepared, so that on this account it is ordered that _it_ is to be stirred up, that so long as _it_ is stirred up they _may_ thereupon order the use of it; if then _it_ is to be rendered quite useless, _there_ is afterwards no necessity for stirring it. 5. The stirring is declared a purification as regards polluted _things_, where bodily refuse is only such that _it_ is not endless, and so pure that it purifies even that of another.

6\. When _it_ is written of it itself, that _it_ is thus declared in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm _Nask_, that consecrated bull‘s urine which is fetid is to be stirred up for the fire, _it_ is afterwards declared that _it_ is not speaking _only of_ the bull’s urine _which_ is provided those three days [^2]; but that, too, which is old _and_ consecrated, <span id="p312"><sup><small>[ p. 312 ]</small></sup></span> become fetid _and_ is stirred again, when they keep it in use, is proper. 7. And that which the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm _has_ declared is, specially, that one of the high-priests _has_ individually said: ‘That stench is mentioned with reference to the _occasion_ when a stench reaches it of a different kind _from that_ which exists naturally in it.’

## Footnotes

[^3]: (309:3) In the epistle to which he is replying.

[^4]: (309:4) This was the eighteenth of the lost books of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers (see Sls. X, 25, note). It was one of the seven law books, and treated of many legal matters. Among the contents of its first thirty sections the following items are mentioned by the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, p. 310 and one of these passages probably contained the statement quoted in our text:--‘On carrying forth the holy-water and also the pot (dîgŏ-<i>k</i>) to the fire, that is, _with_ purified _and_ thoroughly-washed hands; _and_ the sin of carrying _them_ forth with unpurified _and_ imperfectly-washed hands. On preserving the pot and the other _things_, whose use is with the fire, from defilement with bodily refuse; when, through want of care, defilement occurs, _and_ any one shall carry _it_ unawares to the fire, he who is careless overwhelms _it_ thereby. . . . On lawfully warming the bull’s urine on the fire, _and_ the sin when _it_ is not _done_ lawfully.'

[^1]: (310:1) See Dd. XLVIII, 19, note.

[^2]: (310:2) The argument is that the urine being a consecrated liquid, its corruption is not contaminating (provided it be not occasioned by foreign matter, as alluded to in § 7); but if the stench be sufficient to extinguish or injure the fire, it is as sinful to expose the fire to its influence as it would be to injure the fire with holy-water.

[^1]: (311:1) So the damage to the fire is not occasioned by any impurity of the flesh of the ass or pig (which could be used for a sacred feast), but by the excessive quantity brought to it. The pig was formerly domesticated by the Parsis (see Sls. II, 58), but they have long since adopted the prejudices of the Hindus and Muhammadans as regards its uncleanness.

[^2]: (311:2) Referring probably to the times of the three washings, subsequent to the chief ceremony, which take place after the third, sixth, and ninth nights, respectively, (see Vend. IX, 136, 140, 144.)
