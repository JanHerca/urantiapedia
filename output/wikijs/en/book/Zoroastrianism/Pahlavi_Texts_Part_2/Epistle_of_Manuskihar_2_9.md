## EPISTLE II. TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER IX.

1\. This, too, this aged _one_ (aûzvâr<i>d</i>ŏ [^1]) orders, that, _as to_ the polluted of the countries of Irân, when they do not obtain another washer, their way is then through thoroughly washing _themselves_ [^2]. 2. For you who are understanding the rite and capable of washing, _and_ are the most forward and intelligent of the religious, so long as your previous washing is a way of no assistance, _there_ is _this_ tediously-worded epistle; moreover, all their sin you assign for your own affliction [^3], whose after-course is thus for their Pa<i>n</i><i>k</i>adasa fifteen fold ‘washing’, _at_ the time they shall abandon, _as_ distasteful, that sin which is a new development by way of Upasnât<i>e</i>ê (‘washing downwards’) [^4]; and the sinfulness is his who established that law for them.

3\. And yours are truly creatures of a fetid pool (gand-â<i>v</i>ŏ), who, as regards my motive, always speak about it just as they spoke thus to a priest [^5]: ‘Why _has_ the savoury meat-offering not become forgotten by thee, _while_ the firewood and incense, because it is not possible to eat _them_ up, are quite <span id="p355"><sup><small>[ p. 355 ]</small></sup></span> forgotten?’ 4. Also, _as_ a similitude of your affairs, they are saying that _it is_ as though the stipend of guardianship _were_ always to be demanded just _in accordance_ with omissions _of duty_ (a<i>v</i>âg mânî<i>d</i>îhâ) [^6]. 5. So that even while the trifle of trifles which exists as an interval from the title of leadership unto _that of_ high-priestship—in which, except a title that is no joy of the strictly religious, there is nothing whatever—is, that way, to prepare a source of dispute as to the work which you do for the guardianship, it should, therefore, be a sufficiency (khvâr-bâr), where your own supreme work is purification itself; and to do either _what_ is taught, or is advantageous, would be withdrawing from the country a demand which _has_ caused disturbance (balûbâkînî<i>d</i>ŏ); to subdue _it_ thou shouldst always so decide the daily allowances [^7].

6\. And, to-day, I _have_, on that account, written everything sternly, because that which another person arranges and speaks so opposed _to me_ in evil appearance—which is little fit _to be_ prepared—when I write seasonably, and with friendly and brotherly exaltation, you direct and persevere more expressly in preparing, so that portion upon portion is thus brought forth. 7. In good old age [^8] the great law of after-restoration is a harsh remedy, and, on that <span id="p356"><sup><small>[ p. 356 ]</small></sup></span> supposition, where _a rule_ is shown to descend from their three teachings [^9], _and_ is itself regarded as true, _and_ the wisdom of the period _as_ impotent (anôzôharîkŏ), you yourself fully imagine (hû-minê<i>d</i>ŏ) [^10] that _further restoration_ is not an important [^11] and foremost thing. 8. Those of different faiths of various kinds _have_ many usages and perplexing kinds of doubt, even about the accomplishment _and_ explanation of the statements of the high-priests [^12], for _on_ this subject, about old age (gûnânîh), _and_ even about sprinkling and about yourself accomplishing the religious _rites_, you are wisely _for_ a preservation of the equally wise experience of the profession; _and as to_ the heterodox, that writing which realised that even now memory is opposing you is itself evil-wishing [^13], and you know _it_ is your own arrangement.

9\. This, too, they [^14] say that, if _it be_ on that account that the purifiers shall not always so perform the purification by all three teachings, or every rite which is proper according to one teaching, it will be necessary _that_ the purifiers shall abandon purification. 10. Then about old age, the performance of the ceremonial [^15], _and_ the many times of this which <span id="p357"><sup><small>[ p. 357 ]</small></sup></span> are mentioned as _though_ this _were_ proper, _it_ is stated as regards how it is proper that, when on account of those of the good religion they always proceed just as is mentioned in the Zand teaching of the Avesta [^16], it will then be necessary _that_ they shall abandon the religion. 11. And many other sayings of things like unto these are scattered about (zerkhûnî-aîtŏ), and are named near Âtû<i>r</i>ŏ-pâ<i>d</i> [^17] _as_ hints from you; for this reason they are reckoned (khaprag-aîtŏ) in the thoughts of men.

12\. And this much is written by me in distressing haste I consider _it_ complete, and _may_ peace and every happiness perpetually become hospitably attainable _and_ accomplishable for you thereby, through the severe anguish _and_ discomfort, _and_ the eternal distress and despondency _of_ the healer of affliction, Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, director of the profession of priests of Pârs and Kirmân [^18].

13\. Written in propitiation, praise, and benediction of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels, all the angels of the spiritual and the angels of the worldly _existences, and_ every guardian spirit of the righteous. 14. Homage to the exalted pontiff (ra<i>d</i>ŏ) _sent_ from the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the most heavenly of the heavenly, Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân. 15. The <span id="p358"><sup><small>[ p. 358 ]</small></sup></span> _most_ prayerful _and_ gainful of things is righteousness; great and good and perfect is Zaratû<i>s</i>t; _and_ one _only_ is the way of righteousness, all the others are no ways [^19].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (354:1) From this it appears clearly that Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar was an aged man when these epistles were written, though not too old to travel. The previous allusion to old age, however, in Chap. I, 9, may not have referred to himself.

[^2]: (354:2) As provided in Vend. VIII, 299 (see App. V).

[^3]: (354:3) omits alag, ‘affliction;’ and in K35 it is doubtful whether it be struck out, or not.

[^4]: (354:4) See Chap. III, 2 for both these terms.

[^5]: (354:5) Implying that the laity were inclined to attribute his own strict enforcement of ceremonies, requiring the employment of the priest hoot, to interested motives.

[^6]: (355:1) That is, the laity attributed his brother's laxity, on the other hand, to sheer neglect of duty, and had, therefore, begun to consider his supervision hardly worth paying for.

[^7]: (355:2) Meaning that by adherence to long-established custom, as regards both priestly work and priestly allowances, the laity would be better satisfied and more easily managed.

[^8]: (355:3) Reading hû-kahôbanîh; J has merely kahôbanîh, ‘old age, antiquity.’ He appears to be referring rather to the antiquity of the Avesta law, than to his own old age.

[^9]: (356:1) See Chap. III, 1, Ep. I, v, 1, 6.

[^10]: (356:2) J has khavîtûnê<i>d</i>, ‘you know.’ He deprecates all further investigation into the meaning of the scriptures, which had already been explained by three old commentators, as he doubted the religious wisdom of the age in which he lived.

[^11]: (356:3) The continuation of the text in J ends at this point.

[^12]: (356:4) The commentators.

[^13]: (356:5) That is, the decree of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, though itself objectionable, was opposed to the heterodox who wished for further innovations.

[^14]: (356:6) The heterodox.

[^15]: (356:7) Referring perhaps to the performance of the Vendidâ<i>d</i> service p. 357(which includes the Yasna ceremonial) as directed in Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>b</i>, <i>o</i> (see App. IV).

[^16]: (357:1) It is possible also to read ‘in the teaching of the Avesta and Zand;’ but this would ignore the fact that the ‘teaching’ is the Zand itself.

[^17]: (357:2) The same rival as is mentioned in Chap. V, 14.

[^18]: (357:3) According to Dd. XLV, g the farmâ<i>d</i>âr or ‘director’ of the profession of priests of Pârs was the pê<i>s</i>ûpâî or ‘leader’ of the religion.

[^19]: (358:1) Compare Dd. XCIV, 14, Ep. III, 23.
