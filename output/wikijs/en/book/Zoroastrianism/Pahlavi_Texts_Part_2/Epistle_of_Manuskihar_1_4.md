## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. CHAPTER IV.

1\. I _have_ also seen the spiritual life [^1] in the writing which is in such statements of incompleteness [^2], _and_ owing to the same reason they should not cease from the operation [^3] of washing you—whom may the angels protect!—with the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ [^4]. 2. Because the ancients have said that, when it shall be discarded from use, every water, fire, plant, righteous man, _and_ animal, and all the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> are afflicted, diminished, and made to leap _away_. 3. As it is said in revelation that, _as to_ him _who_ stands _by_ a dead body upon which the Nasû<i>s</i> [^5] _has_ rushed [^6], ‘anusô zî, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! <span id="p293"><sup><small>[ p. 293 ]</small></sup></span> aêsha yâ [^7] paiti-irista ava<i>d</i> [^8] hvare â-tâpayêiti [^9], anusô hâu m<i>a</i>u, anusô avê stârô [^10]\—discontentedly, moreover, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân! does the sun shine upon him who _has been_ by the dead, so discontentedly \[does the moon\] [^11], thus discontentedly do the stars—khshnâvayêiti zî, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! aêshô nâ yô yao<i>z</i>dâthryô, ya<i>d</i> aêtem [^12] paiti-iristem frâ-nasûm kerenaoiti—the man who is purifying propitiates _them_, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân! when _he operates on_ him _who has been_ by the dead, _on_ whom the Nasû<i>s</i> is put forth, _and_ he has become _parted_ from the sacred twigs [^13]\—he propitiates fire, he propitiates <span id="p294"><sup><small>[ p. 294 ]</small></sup></span> water, he propitiates animals _and_ plants [^14], he propitiates the righteous man [^15], he propitiates the righteous woman, both _of them_,’ as _in_ the Avesta [^16] of it:-—khshnâvayêiti âtarem, &c.

4\. When _there_ is no purifier all the angels of the worldly _existence_ become afflicted _and_ dissatisfied; and religious purifiers who are intelligent are even now not to keep backward the work of purification, just as _it has_ come to them by practice from those of the primitive faith, and are not to diminish it. 5. To change a good work properly appointed they shall not accept a law which is not right, a good work not properly appointed [^17]; not to do the work thereof is accounted very sagacious _and_ perfectly wise; and through your freedom from inferiority [^18] the glorifying, commendation, praise, and blessing are your own. 6. For it is said that in all the work of forming and maintaining the law (dâ<i>d</i>istânŏ) those of the primitive faith _were_ very greatly particular about every single thing; and _as to_ the whole operation of that proceeding into which they _have_ entered, those of the primitive faith have become aware of the power which _resides_ in true authority. 7. But, otherwise [^19], the routine which is brought out <span id="p295"><sup><small>[ p. 295 ]</small></sup></span> from revelation [^20] and the teaching of the high-priests is then not authorisedly changed by that priestly man whose decree of the fifteen [^21] _washings_ is written in _your_ epistle [^22]; because, on account of the whole and any perversion (ga<i>s</i>takîh) of the same writing, not of similar utterance with revelation, before which the custom did not exist, I am without doubt as to that decree.

8\. And in it [^23], moreover, is written, declared, _and_ contained (van<i>g</i>î<i>d</i>ŏ) that once _washing_ is mentioned [^24], until a purifier comes who is acquainted with the ritual, who washes just as declared in revelation. 9. _To be_ so washed I consider just as a thing for which he is even now as _it were_ a purifier who is a good washer [^25], that of which _it_ is written below _and_ clearly realised that it should not be decreed; _and_ through the scanty deliverance written therein [^26] _it_ is manifest it would not be the statement above [^27]. <span id="p296"><sup><small>[ p. 296 ]</small></sup></span> 10\. If learned knowledge, _relating_ both to that about inferior matters (a<i>g</i>îrtarîhâ) and that about superior matters, _be_ [^28] true authority praised _and_ declared by the great primitive faith, former high-priests _and_ those newly arisen (navakgandakânŏ) would be _and_ would have been similarly forward; then, too, it would exist not so much with the priestly men _of_ the time _as with_ the learned officiating priests (magôpatân) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _who_ have been before. 11. And when, moreover, all the Avesta and Zand are easy _to_ a priest [^29], pre-eminently acquainted with the liturgy _and_ a supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _he has_ attained _unto, and_ should remain with, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and [^30] the officiating priestship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the supreme, world-managing, religion-observing (hû-dîn nikah) sovereignty as to _religious_ treatises [^31]. 12. To change then their practice in the law would be entirely an outcry apart from deliberation, and a like violation of the unanimity of the spirits who are the heads _and_ guardians [^32] of the religion, _and of_ the unanimity of the source of opinion of the good themselves, for the sake of _what is_ not acceptable.

13\. But the statement above [^33] is, was, _and will_ be that which remains a good idea well considered by them with the centre of thought, as to _its_ well-operating <span id="p297"><sup><small>[ p. 297 ]</small></sup></span> characteristics, just contention, and complete powerfulness. 14. Also from the teaching of just high-priests, through the preservation of much evidence, and ascertained for the members of the assemblies of various provinces (shat<i>r</i>ô shat<i>r</i>ô), are shown the opinion _and_ experience of most priestly men; and to make the various districts (kûstakŏ kûstakŏ) thrivingly steadfast, an unperverted _one_ should be set up in all four quarters (pâ<i>d</i>kôs) of the same province.

15\. And a semblance of it is apparent even from that which the glorified Nîshahpûhar, the supreme officiating priest [^34], and also other officiating priests of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _have_ said, _that one is_ not to change any teaching of theirs thereon after _it is_ provided, _and_ not to render useless the statements of other authority thereon. 16. But that which they should accept _from_ them as a certainty is to maintain the statements of other high-priests as pre-eminent; _and_ not to change the operation of statements of another description _has_ appeared lawful. 17. Even so it was as that _same_ Nîshahpûhar, in the council of the glorified (anôshakŏ rûbânô) Khûsrô [^35], king of <span id="p298"><sup><small>[ p. 298 ]</small></sup></span> kings _and_ son of Kavâ<i>d</i>,—by preserving old things (ligânŏ)—showed that way on whose thoughts they are established, and wrote them unaltered, so that such thoughts thereon became as _it were_ decided; and their thoughts thereon, after such decree of his, have so become unanimous. 18. Through the importance _of his_ assured rank, and the rest which was said by him in the work of sustaining the faithful, he maintains as much as the other statements, one _by_ one, from the deliberative teaching of those high-priests.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (292:3) Reading dî<i>d</i> ahvôîh; but it can also be read stihânŏîh, in which case the translation would be:--‘And my worldly condition.’

[^2]: (292:4) Meaning the incomplete kind of purification which their statements complained of, or his referred to.

[^3]: (292:5) K35 and BK omit the <i>r</i> in ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>akŏ.

[^4]: (292:6) See App. IV.

[^5]: (292:7) The fiend of corruption (see Dd. XVII, 7).

[^6]: (292:8) The three Avesta passages here quoted, with their ‘Land (Pahlavi translation), are from Vend. IX, 161-163, and are freely translated (trans. D) thus:---’It grieves the sun, indeed, O Spitama p. 293 Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! to shine upon a man defiled by the dead; it grieves the moon, it grieves the stars. That man delights them, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! who cleanses from the Nasu those whom she has defiled; he delights the fire, he delights the water, he delights the earth, he delights the cow, he delights the trees, he delights the faithful, both men and women.' The Avesta text is given according to the standard edition of Westergaard (IX, 41, 42), and all variants of any importance, in the three MSS. here used, are mentioned in the notes. These passages are also referred to in Ep. II, iii, 5.

[^7]: (293:1) K35 and BK insert the last three words, anusô âvâ stârô, here.

[^8]: (293:2) J inserts yâ here.

[^9]: (293:3) J has â-tâpayaêta, but K35 and BK omit the word.

[^10]: (293:4) K35 and BK have khshathrô-chinanghô, ‘of a desire of authority’ (which occurs in Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 112 as the name of a man) instead of avê stârô, which they have inserted earlier. They also leave a blank space for the words maman akhû<i>r</i>sandîhâ, ‘moreover, discontentedly’ (which begin the Pahlavi translation), as if they were descended from a damaged original.

[^11]: (293:5) B All three MSS. omit the words in brackets, which are necessary to complete the Pahlavi version.

[^12]: (293:6) K35 and BK omit aêtem.

[^13]: (293:7) J has ‘who has become polluted,’ which separation from the sacred twigs (see Dd. XLIII, 5), or other ceremonial apparatus, implies. The phrase is omitted in Pahl. Vend. IX, 162.

[^14]: (294:1) J has ‘he propitiates plants,’ as in Pahl. Vend. IX, I63.

[^15]: (294:2) Literally ‘male.’

[^16]: (294:3) The initial words of which here follow their Pahlavi translation, instead of preceding it.

[^17]: (294:4) J omits these six words.

[^18]: (294:5) Reading afrôtarîh, as in BK; K35 had originally a<i>v</i>artarîh, ‘pre-eminence,’ as in J, but the copyist wrote afrô (= aparva) over the a<i>v</i>arta, as a correction, leaving it doubtful whether he meant afrôtarîh or aparvarîh, ‘want of education.’

[^19]: (294:6) That is, unless confirmed by the decisions of the ancients.

[^20]: (295:1) J has ‘which is brought out with knowledge of the _purifying_ cup (tâ<i>s</i>tîk), with preservation of faith, and with manifestation from revelation.’

[^21]: (295:2) All three MSS. have ‘sixteen’ in ciphers, but it is evident that Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam and his erroneous teaching of the sufficiency of fifteen washings (see Ep. III, 1, 2) are here referred to.

[^22]: (295:3) Reading <i>s</i>emag, a Huz. hybrid for nâmak.

[^23]: (295:4) The decree of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, apparently.

[^24]: (295:5) Referring probably to Vend. VIII, 299, which provides a washing for the pointed person by himself, if he can find no one willing to purify him (see App. V).

[^25]: (295:6) That is, for such a purpose any ordinary washer would be sufficient.

[^26]: (295:7) In Pahl Vend. VIII, 299, which states that, although pure enough for ordinary purposes, he must still abstain from engaging in ceremonies for others (see App. V).

[^27]: (295:8) That is, it is very different from the propitiation mentioned in § 3.

[^28]: (296:1) J has ‘because if even for that about superior matters, acquaintance with religion, and learned knowledge there be,’ &c.

[^29]: (296:2) That is, when he knows all the scriptures and commentaries by heart.

[^30]: (296:3) J omits ‘Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and.’

[^31]: (296:4) That is, he has full authority to interpret the scriptures.

[^32]: (296:5) Reading saran sa<i>r</i>dârân, but in K35 the two words overlap, so that sar-sa<i>r</i>dârân, ‘head guardians,’ might be intended.

[^33]: (296:6) Probably referring to the quotation from the Vendidâ<i>d</i> in § 3.

[^34]: (297:1) This môbad of môbads is mentioned in Pahl. Vend. III, 151, V, 112, VI, 71, VIII, 64, XVI, 10, 17, AV. I, 35, and twenty-four times in the Nîrangistân (see Sls. I, 4 n). His name is spelt in various ways.

[^35]: (297:2) King Khûsrô, son of Kavâ<i>d</i>, who is best known by his title Nôshirvân, or Anôshirvân, ‘immortal-soulled,’ reigned A.D. 531-579; and the statement that Nîshahpûhar was one of his councillors (made little more than three centuries after his death, and, therefore, probably correct) is of considerable importance for fixing a limit to the age of those Pahlavi books in which he is mentioned. These books are the Pahlavi Nîrangistân, a late recension of the Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i>, and the Book of Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf, in which last it is p. 298 stated that Vîrâf was called by the name of Nikhshâpûr by some. From the statements made in our text it seems probable that the council was employed in revising the Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i>, in which they were careful not to erase the opinions of older commentators, and thus confirmed their statements by their own authority. It is possible that this council was that mentioned in Byt. I, 7, where the name Nishâpûr also occurs, but whether it refers to a man or a city is not quite certain. This council, which seems to have been summoned for condemning the heresy of Mazdak, was held probably two or three years before Khûsrô came to the throne (see Nŏldeke: Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 465).
