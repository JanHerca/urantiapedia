## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XLVI.

7\. The forty-fifth question is that which you ask thus: Is it allowable _that_ those of the priesthood, when there is no daily livelihood for them from the life of the priesthood, should abandon the priesthood, and _that_ other work _be_ done, or not? <span id="p154"><sup><small>[ p. 154 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. The reply is this, that there is no loss of reputation to priests from priestly duties (aêrpatîh), which are themselves the acquired knowledge _that_ is accumulated _by_ the priestly disposition, care for the soul, _and_ the requisite good works. 3. _And_ there is this advantage, that, through acquaintance with the religion _of_ the sacred beings, _and_ certainty as to the reward of the spirit, they make _them_ become more contented in adversity, more intelligent as regards stability of character in difficulty _and_ restriction, and more through knowledge the abode of hope for those saved. 4. So that it is not fit they should abandon the priesthood, which is both harmless _and_ an employment _with_ advantages _that has_ required much trouble to learn.

5\. But, indeed, when they do not obtain [^1] a daily livelihood from priestly duty, and the good do not give them chosen righteous gifts [^2] for it, and they do not let _them_ obtain _any_ from next of kin _or_ the wicked even by begging, a livelihood _may be_ requested from the paid performance of ceremonies, management of all religious rites (dînô), _and_ other priestly disciple's duty therein [^3]. 6. When even by that they do not obtain _it, they_ are to seek a livelihood by agriculture, sheep-rearing, penmanship, _or_ other proper employment among priests; _and_ when _it_ is not possible for them to live even by these, _they are to seek it_ by bearing arms, hunting, _or_ other proper employment in the profession of a virtuous warrior. 7. And when even it is not <span id="p155"><sup><small>[ p. 155 ]</small></sup></span> possible for them to maintain their own bodies, which are in requisite control, by that which is cravingly digested, _they_ are to beg a righteous gift [^4] authorisedly (dastôbarîhâ) as an effectual remedy; by living idly, or not expending strength, their own bodies, which are in control, are without livelihood, but not authorisedly [^5].
