<span id="p278"><sup><small>[ p. 278 ]</small></sup></span>

## OBSERVATIONS.

1\. For all divisions into chapters and sections the translator is responsible, as the manuscripts are written continuously, with very few stops marked, and even those are often misplaced.

2-6. (The same as on page [2](sbe18008_htm.html).)

7\. The manuscripts mentioned are:--

BK, an old imperfect copy of K35 written in Kirmân, but now in Bombay.

J (about 60 years old), belonging to Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji in Bombay.

K35 (probably written A.D. 1572), No. 35 in the University Library at Kopenhagen; upon the text of which this translation is based.

M10 (about 150 years old), a Persian Rivâyat, No. 10 of the Haug Collection in the State Library at Munich.

## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SÎRKÂN.

THROUGH the name and assistance of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the whole of the sacred beings, all the angels of the spiritual _and_ the angels of the worldly _existences_.

A copy of the epistle of the priest Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^1], son of Yûdân-Yim, which _was_ composed by him for the good _people_ of Sîrkân [^2], on the contents of the precepts (vi<i>g</i>îr-ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>ŏ)) which the priest Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam [^3], son of Yûdân-Yim, prepared.

## CHAPTER I.

1\. _In_ the name of the sacred beings, who sent you a soul with long life, with provision for proper progress, _and_ with the protection of increase of righteousness and wisdom, may such works and <span id="p280"><sup><small>[ p. 280 ]</small></sup></span> mysterious dignity, encompassed with [^1] happiness, now possess increasing prosperity and a complete share of pre-eminent welfare and great exaltation in both worlds.

2\. The epistle [^2] which _was_ wisely, properly, and with religious demeanour ordered by you, _and_ sent by a courier (paîkŏ), _has_ come, and _has_ enveloped _and_ assailed (<i>g</i>astŏ) me, indeed, with appalling intelligence on other subjects; and if even a portion [^3] _of_ the vast importance and great value, as regards your heavenly _concerns_, arrangements, and natural _and_ unpremeditated (avarîk) prodigies [^4], which are for my knowledge, for the sake of courteous (drû<i>d</i>îk) information, _be_ owing to intelligence for which the courteousness _and_ proper courageousness are among you, special pleasure is received _therewith_. 3. And praise is, thereupon, recited by me to the sacred beings, as regards the conflicting affairs even of this disordered (gûmê<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîkŏ) existence; worldly possessions, as much as are suitable for the assistance of wisdom, are proper [^5], and the gift of virtuous pleasure is the gain of the undeserving good work _or_ prayer they (the sacred beings) shall accept; it causes aggrandizement and is as deserving as even that which the decision of <span id="p281"><sup><small>[ p. 281 ]</small></sup></span> the wise has said about _it_, that even from the management of disordered possessions which are impaired _there_ is advantage through the power of wisdom; _and_ they (the sacred beings) select and cleanse and uplift the good works _in_ such manner as a precious stone (sag khêl) from the water, and gold brocade [^1] from the dust.

4\. My pleasure, also, is as much increased through the information clue to the same courtesy, _and I have_ a new _and_ great desire for the arrival of information, continuously from henceforth, about the perfect courageousness, enduring humility, good works; worshipping, favouring position, and eagerness of soul of you who _have_ recounted _your_ great thoughtfulness for religion _and have_ provided good works.

5\. On account of the universal renown (aspôharakânîh) of the good _people_ of Khvanîras [^2], which is yours, owing to the favour that is your complete happiness, ardently _and_ joyfully most desired, and constantly _so_, when _there_ are opportunities of seeing you--though it is supposed _to be_ the advantage of your own religion, joy of soul, courteousness, _and_ proper constancy--since my will _resides_ among you, you make known _and_ command my actions, through the will of the sacred beings.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (279:1) The high-priest of Pârs and Kirmân (see the heading to Dd., p. 3).

[^2]: (279:2) Written Sîrkân once, Sîrkânŏ twice, and Sîrgâno four times, in these epistles. It was a town of considerable importance in former times (see Ouseley's Oriental Geography, pp. 138-145), about thirty parasangs south of Kirmân.

[^3]: (279:3) He was high-priest of Sîrkân and brother of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (as expressly stated in the heading to Ep. II), both being sons of the same father.

[^1]: (280:1) Or, ‘sent down in,’ according as we read parvastŏ or frôstŏ.

[^2]: (280:2) An epistle complaining of certain heretical teachings of their high-priest, Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, which is no longer extant.

[^3]: (280:3) Reading va hat vâhar-i<i>k</i>.

[^4]: (280:4) The epistle which he had received from his brother, Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, some time before, seems also to have mentioned certain omens (see Ep. II, i, 3).

[^5]: (280:5) J omits shâye<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘are proper,’ because it follows the other shâye<i>d</i>, ‘are suitable;’ but it is not always safe to assume that the repetition of a word is a blunder.

[^1]: (281:1) Reading dîpakŏ-î zahabâ.

[^2]: (281:2) The central region of the earth, containing all the lands best known to the Iranians (see Dd. XC, 3).
