## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXVIII.

1\. _As to_ the seventy-seventh question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: _As to_ the nature of the heinousness _and_ sinfulness of committing adultery, _and_ the worldly retribution specified _for it_ in revelation, <span id="p228"><sup><small>[ p. 228 ]</small></sup></span> _will_ you then direct _some one_ to point out to us the modes [^1] of retribution for it?

2\. The reply is this, that it is adultery, heinous _and_ vicious, which first Dahâk _used_ to commit, and _he_ is known by the illicit intercourse which _was_ his desire with Va<i>d</i>ak [^2], who _was his_ mother, in the life-time of Aûrva<i>d</i>âsp [^3], who _was_ his father, without [^4] the authority of Aûrva<i>d</i>âsp, who was the husband of Va<i>d</i>ak whose practising of sin, unauthorisedly _and_ injudiciously, _was_ itself heinous _and_ very frequent. 3. And its modes _of_ theft or spoliation are just as much more heinous than other theft _and_ spoliation as a man _and_ that which arises from his procreation of man are greater than the position of property.

4\. One is this, that _it_ is important to consider with steadfastness the courtezan life of the adulteress _and_ the bad disposition assuredly _and_ undoubtedly therein; she causes pillage unauthorisedly, and in _her_ practice, also, intercourse during menstruation, owing to _its_ resembling the burning of seed, is a frightful kind of handiwork (dastô). <span id="p229"><sup><small>[ p. 229 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. One is this, that it may be _that_ she becomes pregnant by that intercourse, _and has_ to commit on her child [^5] the murdering of progeny.

6\. One is this, that it may be in pregnancy, _by_ her coming to intercourse _with_ another man, _that_ the living child which is in her womb has died through that intercourse.

7\. One is this, that it may he that she becomes pregnant by that intercourse, _and_ the pregnancy _having_ given indications, through shame or fear she swallows a drug [^6] \[and seeks a remedy, and murders the child in _her_ womb.

8\. One is this, that it may\] be that a woman who is foreign or infidel, and becomes pregnant by that intercourse, gives birth to a child, _and_ it has grown up with the child which is known _to belong to_ the husband of the woman, _and_ remains in foreign habits (an-aîrîh) or infidelity. 9. The committer of the illicit intercourse is as unobservant and grievously sinful as _he_ who shall lead _his_ own child from his native habits (aîrîh) and the goad religion into foreign habits and infidelity; as to the sin which that child may commit in childhood _he_ is the sinner, and as to that which it may commit in manhood _he_ is equally sinful with it. 10. Also, if that child be put to death in childhood, _and_ be passed through water, rain, _or_ fire, _or_ be buried in the well-yielding earth [^7], _he_ is an equally vicious murderer, _and_ is defiled thereby through _being_ the invisible causer. <span id="p230"><sup><small>[ p. 230 ]</small></sup></span> 11\. Likewise, if he who is a man of the good religion accustoms a woman to illicit intercourse, _and_ through adultery a child is born and grows up, even then to practise undutifully that which undutifulness committed is to make a wretched _and_ clandestine connection. 12. On account of the birth _having_ occurred through illicit intercourse _it_ is grievously sinful; through propriety _it_ is praise_worthy_, and through falsity _it_ is sinful [^8], _and_ it is said that a bastard is not appointed in superintendence over _any one_. 13. _If_ it be done so that pregnancy does not occur, even then every single time—not to mention the text (a<i>v</i>istâk) _as to_ the matter regarding the destruction of his own living _seed_ [^9]\—_it_ is _a sin of_ two Tanâpûhars, which are six hundred stîrs [^10]; and regarding that emission _it_ is inexpiable (atanâpûhar) [^11]. <span id="p231"><sup><small>[ p. 231 ]</small></sup></span> 14\. As much on account of the conversation as on account of the companionship _of_ the man who goes unto various women, for the sake of a man's sin, and is unatoning, _should_ his own body be also defiled with bodily refuse (hîgar-hômônd) [^12], or _should_ those kinds of harm be not _kept_ away from another [^13], even then every single time of the bodily refuse bringing harm to his own body is _a sin of_ sixty stîrs [^14], and through making his own body defiled with bodily refuse is each _time a sin of_ sixty stîrs; and if he washes with water that defilement with his own bodily refuse, or that which is harmed _thereby_, every single time _it_ is _a sin of_ six hundred [^15] stîrs.

15\. And if it be a foreign or infidel woman, apart from the sinfulness _about_ which _I have_ written, _it_ is a sin of sixty stîrs on account of not controlling the sins _and_ vicious enjoyment of the foreign woman. 16. And, finally, the other various sins which are owing to _this_ sin are very numerous, _and_ grievous to thousands of connections, and _it_ is thereby contaminating to them _in_ a fearful manner.

17\. The retribution is renunciation _of sin_ in procuring pardon; and the renunciation in his turning from equally grievous disobedience [^16], every single <span id="p232"><sup><small>[ p. 232 ]</small></sup></span> time that _he turns_ from similar viciousness, and as an atonement for the sin, is to arrange, or order, four (arbâ) marriages of the next of kin to his own wife, lawfully, authorisedly, and most hopeful of offspring. 18. Through fear of the grievous sinfulness which _I have_ recounted, _in case of_ a child of those of the good religion who has no giver of shame [^17], and to keep lawfully in subjection a child who is under control, he who is unnurtured is lawfully given nurture, _and_ is nominated for lawfully bringing up. 19. And to turn a man _or_ woman of bad disposition, by eulogy and entreaty, or [^18] _by_ distress (fangîm) and fear and other representations, from that bad disposition _and_ vicious habit; to order next-of-kin marriage [^19] and all the religious rites (hamâk dînô), the Dvâ<i>z</i>dah-hômâst [^20], the ceremony _in honour_ of the waters [^21], and the _presentation of_ holy-water to the fires [^22]; to remove the burden of offspring [^23] which is distressing those of the good religion, and to force them from the infidelity acquired, which is a very atoning atonement for such sins, are extremely proper proceedings (a<i>v</i>îr-farhakhtîkîh).

## Footnotes

[^1]: (228:1) M14 has ‘the various modes.’

[^2]: (228:2) This is evidently the name written Udaî in Pâz. in Bd. XXXI, 6, who was, therefore, the _daughter_ of Bayak; the fact of her being the mother of Dahâk is more clearly expressed in the Pahlavi text of Chap. LXXII, 5.

[^3]: (228:3) This is the name written Khrûtâsp in Bd. XXXI, 6, which is a Pâz. reading, though confirmed by the Pahl. form in TD (as Udaî is, to some extent, by the Pahl. Aû<i>d</i> of TD). This Aûrva<i>d</i>âsp, whose name can also be read Khûrûtâsp, must be distinguished from his namesake, the father of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, whose name became corrupted into Lôharâsp (see Bd. XXXI, 28, 29).

[^4]: (228:4) K35 omits a<i>v</i>îk, ‘without,’ here, but has it in Chap. LXXII, 5. Without this particle the meaning would be ‘who _was_ the high-priest of his father, Aûrva<i>d</i>âsp.’

[^5]: (229:1) M14 has ‘_and_ with the assistance of another man _she has_ so to commit on her child of that pregnancy.’ The interpolation is clumsy, and does not make the sentence easier to translate.

[^6]: (229:2) The passage which follows, in brackets, is from M14; there being evidently something omitted from K35 at this point.

[^7]: (229:3) The contamination of water, rain, fire, or earth, by contact with p. 230 a corpse, being considered a heinous sin (see Sls. II, 9, 50, 76, XIII, 19).

[^8]: (230:1) That is, procuring the birth of a legitimate child is highly meritorious, but an illegitimate birth is sinful.

[^9]: (230:2) Referring probably to Vend. VIII, 77-82, which states that the voluntary waste of seed is an inexpiable sin, as mentioned at the end of this section.

[^10]: (230:3) A Tanâpûhar (Av. tanuperetha) sin was originally one that required the sinner to place his body at the disposal of the high-priest, in order to atone for it; but it was not necessarily a sin worthy of death, or mortal sin. At the time when the Vendidâ<i>d</i> was written, such a sin was punished by two hundred lashes of a horse-whip or scourge (see Vend. IV, 72). Subsequently, when the Vendidâ<i>d</i> scale of punishments was converted into a scale of weights, for estimating the amounts of sins and good works, a Tanâpûhar sin was estimated at three hundred stîrs (στατήρ) of four dirhams (δραχμή, ) each (see Sls. I, 1, 2). The weight of 600 stîrs was probably about that of 840 rûpîs, or 21 3/5 lbs. (see Chap. LII, r n).

[^11]: (230:4) That is, a sin which cannot be atoned for even by giving up tae's body for execution. Anâpûhar in Pahl. Vend. VIII, 82.

[^12]: (231:1) See Chap. XLVIII, 19.

[^13]: (231:2) M14 has ‘or he does not wash those harmful kinds of bodily refuse,’ which is inconsistent with what follows.

[^14]: (231:3) This is the estimated weight of a Khôr sin, originally the crime of inflicting a severe hurt, ranging from a bruise to a wound or broken bone not endangering life (see Sls. I, 1, 2). The weight was probably equal to that of 84 rûpîs.

[^15]: (231:4) M14 has ‘three hundred.’

[^16]: (231:5) Reading asrû<i>s</i>tîh as in M14, instead of the aîtrôî<i>s</i>tŏîh of K35. Possibly the latter word might be read 3-trôî<i>s</i>tŏîh, ‘the p. 232 passing away of the three _nights_,’ referring to the Av. phrase thrity<i>a</i>u khshapô thrao<i>s</i>ta, ‘on the passing away of the third night,’ in Hn. II, 18; the three nights are those immediately after death, while the soul is supposed to remain hovering about the body, thinking over its sins, and dreading the approaching judgment of the angel Rashnu; but previous renunciation of sin would relieve it from much of this dread.

[^17]: (232:1) That is, one not born in shame, but a legitimate child. M14 has shîr, ‘milk,’ substituted for sharm, ‘shame.’

[^18]: (232:2) M14 has ‘woman of family with extending sins or bad disposition.’

[^19]: (232:3) See Chap. LXV.

[^20]: (232:4) See Chap. XLVIII, 25.

[^21]: (232:5) Probably the Abân Nyâyi<i>s</i>.

[^22]: (232:6) Probably the Âta<i>s</i> Nyâyi<i>s</i>.

[^23]: (232:7) By assisting in their support.
