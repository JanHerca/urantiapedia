## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XIII.

1\. The twelfth question is that which you ask thus: In the fourth night do they score off (ba<i>r</i>â angârênd) the sin by the good works, and does he go by the residue (bôn); or do they inflict punishment on him for the sin which _has_ happened to him, and give reward _and_ recompense for the good works which he _has_ done?

2\. The reply is this, that at dawn of the third night the account is prepared it is said, and about the sin which he _has_ atoned for, _and_ the good work which is its equivalent (â<i>v</i>âr) _there_ is no need for account, since the account is about the good works which may be appropriated by him _as_ his own, and about the sin which may remain _in_ him as _its_ origin. 3. Because the origin of it (the sin atoned for) remains distinct, and it is cancelled (astar<i>d</i>ŏ) <span id="p32"><sup><small>[ p. 32 ]</small></sup></span> by it (the good work), they balance it therewith; and they weigh the excess and deficiency, as it may be, of the _other_ good works _and_ sin.

4\. Of those living, at the just, impartial (a<i>k</i>afsi<i>s</i>nŏ) balance the _man_ of proper habits (dâ<i>d</i>ŏ), whose good works are more, when sin _has_ happened to him, undergoes a temporary (vidanâîk) punishment and becomes eternally cleansed by the good works; and he of improper habits, of much sin and little good works, attains temporary enjoyment by those good works, _but_ through the sin which they perceive _in_ him he is suffering punishment unto the resurrection.
