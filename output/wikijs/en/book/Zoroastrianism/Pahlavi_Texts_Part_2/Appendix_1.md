## APPENDIX. 1. LEGENDS RELATING TO KERESÂSP.

THE Avesta informs us that Keresâspa was a son of Thrita the Sâman, and the brother of Urvâkhshaya [^1]. From the name of his father‘s family he is sometimes called Sâma Keresâspa [^2], but his more usual title is Nareman<i>a</i>u or Nairiman<i>a</i>u, ’the manly-minded [^3].‘ He is described as ’a youthful hero, wearing side-locks and carrying a club [^4],' to whom the witch Knãthaiti [^5] attached herself; she whom Zaratû<i>s</i>t promised to destroy by means of the apostle Saoshyãs, who is to be born hereafter [^6]. And his body is watched over by 99,999 guardian spirits [^7].

<span id="p370"><sup><small>[ p. 370 ]</small></sup></span>

Of his exploits we are told that he ‘slew the serpent Srvara, which devoured horses and men, which was poisonous and yellow, over which yellow poison flowed a hand’s-breadth high. On which Keresâspa cooked a beverage in a caldron at the midday hour, and the serpent being scorched, hissed, sprang forth, away from the caldron, and upset the boiling water; Keresâsp, the manly-minded, fled aside frightened [^8].' We are further told that he slew the golden-heeled Ga<i>n</i>darewa [^9]; that he smote Hitâspa in revenge for the murder of his brother, Urvâkhshaya [^10]; that he smote the Hunus who are the nine highwaymen, and those descended from Nivika and Dâ<i>s</i>tayâni [^11]; also Vareshava the Dânayan, Pitaona with the many witches, Arezô-shamana, and Snâvidhaka [^12]; and that he withstood many smiters or murderers [^13].

The details of these exploits, still extant in the Avesta, are very scanty; but some of them appear to have been more fully described in a legend about the soul of Keresâspa which formerly constituted the fourteenth fargar<i>d</i> of the Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask, the contents of which are thus summarized in the ninth book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>:--

'The fourteenth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>\-fravakhshî [^14], is about <span id="p371"><sup><small>[ p. 371 ]</small></sup></span> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>‘s showing the terrible state of the soul of Keresâsp [^15] to Zaratû<i>s</i>t; the dismay of Zaratû<i>s</i>t owing to that terrible state; the sorrowful speaking of Keresâsp as regards the slaying of multitudes, for which mankind extol him, whereby abstentions from sin _occurred_; and the recognition of him by the creator, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as extinguishing his fire. The supplication of Keresâsp _for_ the best existence from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> for those exploits when the serpent (gaz) Srôbar [^16] _was_ slain by him, and the violence of that adversary; when Gandarep [^17] with the golden heels _was_ smitten by him, _and_ the marvellousness of that fiend; when the Hunus _of_ Ve<i>s</i>kŏ [^18], who are <span id="p372"><sup><small>[ p. 372 ]</small></sup></span> _descendants_ of Nîvîk _and_ Dâstânîk [^19], _were slain_ by him, _and_ the grievous harm and disaster owing to them; _and_ when the mighty wind [^20] _was_ appeased by him, and brought back from damaging the world to benefiting the creatures; _and_ for that which _happens_ when, owing to confinement [^21], Dahâk becomes eager, rushes on for the destruction of the world, _and_ attempts the annihilation of the creatures; _and_ his being roused to smite him and to tame that powerful fiend for the creatures of the world. The opposition of fire to Keresâsp, through _his_ causing distress to it _and_ keeping away _from it_, which _were_ owing to his seeking hell; _the supplication of_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t to the fire to have compassion upon _him_, which was owing to his sin; the compliance of the fire _with_ that request; and the departure of the soul of Keresâsp to the ever-stationary existence [^22]. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness [^23].’

Although the Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask has long been lost, the legend contained in this fourteenth fargar<i>d</i> still survives in its Pahlavi form, though probably somewhat abridged, and a Persian paraphrase of this Pahlavi version is also to be found in the Persian <span id="p373"><sup><small>[ p. 373 ]</small></sup></span> Rivâyats [^24]. The Pahlavi legend is included among a series of quotations, regarding the importance of fire, contained in a Pahlavi Rivâyat preceding the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk in some manuscripts [^25]; and its close correspondence with the' above summary of the fourteenth fargar<i>d</i> of the Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask will be seen from the following translation of it:--

. . . . ‘And _it_ is declared that fire is so precious that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: "Of whose soul is it _that_ the actions’ [^26], position, consciousness, and guardian spirit seem best when thou shalt behold _it_?"

'And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: "Of him who is Keresâsp."

'Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> summoned the soul of Keresâsp, and the soul of Keresâsp saw [^27] Zaratû<i>s</i>t and, on account of the misery which it had seen in hell, it spoke unto _him_ thus: "I have been a priest of Kâpûl [^28], which should be a power in support of me; and for the sake of begging life I have ever travelled through the world, and the world would have become hideous in my eyes, the world which should have feared my splendour [^29]."

<span id="p374"><sup><small>[ p. 374 ]</small></sup></span>

'And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "Stand off, _thou_ soul of Keresâsp! for thou shouldst be hideous in my eyes, because the fire, which is my son [^30], _was_ extinguished by thee, and no care _of it was_ provided by thee."

And the soul of Keresâsp spoke thus: "Forgive me, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! and grant me the best existence! grant me the supreme heaven! The serpent (a<i>z</i>ŏ) Srôvbar [^31] is slain outright, which _was_ swallowing horses _and_ swallowing men, and its teeth were as long as my arm, its ear was as large as fourteen blankets (nama<i>d</i>ŏ), its eye was as large as a wheel, and its horn was as much as Dahâk [^32] in height. And I was running as much as half a day on _its_ back, till _its_ head _was_ smitten by me at the neck _with_ a club made for _my_ hand, and _it was_ slain outright by me [^33]. And if that serpent had not been slain by me, all thy creatures would have _been_ completely annihilated by it, and thou wouldst never have known a remedy _for_ Aharman."

'Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "Stand off! for the fire, which is my son, _was_ extinguished by thee."

‘Keresâsp spoke thus: "Grant me, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! that best existence, the supreme heaven! for by me Gandarep [^34] _was_ slain outright, by whom twelve <span id="p375"><sup><small>[ p. 375 ]</small></sup></span> districts _were_ devoured at once. When I looked among the teeth of Gandarep, dead men [^35] were sticking among his teeth; and my beard _was_ seized by him, and I dragged him out of the sea [^36]; nine days and nights the conflict _was_ maintained by us in the sea, and then I became more powerful than Gandarep. The sole of Gandarep’s foot _was_ also seized by me, and the skin _was_ flayed off up to _his_ head, and with it the hands and feet of Gandarep _were_ bound; _he was_ also dragged by me out to the shore of the sea, and _was_ delivered by. me over _to_ Âkhrûtrag [^37]; and he slaughtered _and_ ate my fifteen horses. I also fell down in a dense thicket (aî<i>s</i>akŏ), and Gandarep carried off _my_ friend Âkhrûtrag, and she who was my wife _was_ carried off by him [^38], and my father _and_ nurse (dâyakŏ) _were_ carried off by him. And I took under _my_ protection (dinhârîgînî<i>d</i>ŏ) and raised all the people _of_ our pleasant _place_, and every single step I sprang forward a thousand steps, and fire fell into everything which _was_ struck by my foot _as_ it sprang forward [^39]; I went out to the sea, and they were brought back by me, <span id="p376"><sup><small>[ p. 376 ]</small></sup></span> and Gandarep _was_ taken and slain by me [^40]. And if he had not been slain by me, Aharman would have become predominant over thy creatures."

'Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "Stand off! for _thou art_ hideous in my eyes, because the fire, which is my son, _was_ extinguished by thee."

‘Keresâsp spoke thus: "Grant _me_, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! heaven _or_ the supreme heaven! for I have slain the highwaymen [^41] who were so big in body that, when they were walking, people considered in this _way_, that ’below them are the stars and moon, and below them moves the sun _at_ dawn, and the water of the sea reaches up to their knees.' And I reached up to their legs, and they _were_ smitten on the legs by me; they fell, and the hills on the earth _were_ shattered by them [^42]. And if those fallen [^43] highwaymen _had_ not been slain by me, Aharman would have become predominant over thy creatures."

'Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. spoke thus: "Stand off! for thou shouldst be hideous in my eyes, because the fire, which is my son, _was_ extinguished by thee."

‘Keresâsp spoke thus: "Grant me, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! heaven _or_ the supreme heaven! When the wind _was_ weakened (rakhtŏ) and paralysed by me, the <span id="p377"><sup><small>[ p. 377 ]</small></sup></span> demons deceived the wind, and they spoke unto the wind thus: ’_He_ is more resisting thee than all the creatures and creation, and thou shouldst think of him thus, that “there is no one walks upon this earth more resistant of me _than_ Keresâsp;” he despises demons _and_ men, and thee, too, who shouldst be the wind, _even_ thee he despises.‘ And the wind, when those words _were_ heard by it, came on so strongly that every tree and shrub which was in its path _was_ uprooted, and the whole earth which was in its path _was_ reduced to powder (payan<i>g</i>ânŏîaîtŏ ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>ŏ), and darkness arose. And when it came to me, who am Keresâsp, it was not possible for it to lift my foot from the ground; and I arose and sallied forth (ba<i>r</i>â yehabûn<i>d</i>) upon the earth, and I stood _upon_ it, with both feet on an equality (mirîh), until a rampart (pû<i>s</i>tŏ) of it _was_ completed, so that I _might_ go again below the earth; that which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> ordered thus: ’Should I appoint a keeper of the earth and sky, they would not forsake me [^44].' And if that thing had not been done by me, Aharman would have become predominant over thy creatures."

'Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "Stand off! for thou shouldst be hideous in my eyes, because the fire, which is my son, _was_ smitten by thee."

Keresâsp spoke thus: "Grant _me_, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! heaven _or_ the supreme heaven! for _it_ is thus <span id="p378"><sup><small>[ p. 378 ]</small></sup></span> declared by revelation, that, when Dahâk has escaped from confinement [^45], no one is able to seek _any_ other remedy _against_ him but me; on that account grant me heaven _or_ the supreme heaven! And if it be not possible to grant me heaven _or_ the supreme heaven, give me again the strength and success which were mine during life! for when thou shalt give me again so much strength and success _as_ were mine when I was produced alive, I _will_ slay Aharman with the demons, I will eradicate darkness from hell, I will complete the beautiful light, and within its sole existence (tang-aê) [^46] you _shall_ sit and move [^47]."

'Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "This I _will_ not give thee, _thou_ soul of Keresâsp! because men shall commit sin; and until men commit no more sin, it is not possible to make thee alive again, and thou wouldst also not be able to make other men alive again, for they produce the resurrection thus, when all men become quite innocent. When men shall die, and their souls are wicked, all comfort shall forsake them, and all the misery and discomfort occasioned by them _shall_ remain."

'When Keresâsp _and_ his exploits were spoken of in this manner, the angels of the spiritual _and_ the angels of the worldly _existences_ wept aloud, and <span id="p379"><sup><small>[ p. 379 ]</small></sup></span> Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân wept aloud [^48] _and_ spoke thus: "Though _there_ should be no deceiver, I would be the deceiver in _thy_ eyes [^49], O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! as regards the soul of Keresâsp; for when Keresâsp should not have existed as a bodily and living _existence, there_ would have been no remnant of anything whatever, or of creature of thine, in the world [^50]."

'When Zaratû<i>s</i>t had become silent therewith, the _angel of_ fire [^51] stood upon _his_ feet [^52], and the sinfulness of Keresâsp unto himself _was_ fully mentioned by him, and he spoke thus: "I shall not let him into heaven."

'And the _angel_ of fire, _having_ spoken thus many <span id="p380"><sup><small>[ p. 380 ]</small></sup></span> words, desisted; and the angel Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan [^53] stood upon _her_ feet, and spoke thus: "I shall not let _him_ into hell, for the benefit produced by him for me _was_ manifold,"

‘Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan, _having_ spoken thus many words, desisted [^54]; _and_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t stood upon _his_ feet, and homage _was_ offered by him unto the fire, and he spoke thus: “I shall provide care for thee, and shall speak of thy exploits in the world, and I shall speak to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^55] and <i>G</i>âmâsp [^56] thus ’Observe fully that a place is made _for_ the fire as _it were_ at once!‘ when Keresâsp _has_ engaged in renunciation _of sin_, and you shall forgive him [^57].”’

The Pahlavi legend breaks off at this point, leaving <span id="p381"><sup><small>[ p. 381 ]</small></sup></span> the reader to infer that Zaratû<i>s</i>t's request was granted. It is succeeded, however, by the following further remarks about Keresâsp, which are evidently connected with the same legend:--

'Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus [^58]: "Whose is the first dead _body_ thou shalt unite (varâ<i>z</i>ês)?"

'And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus [^58]: "_His_ who is Keresâsp [^59]."

'And it seemed grievous _to_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and he spoke unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: "When the business of Keresâsp was the slaughter of men, why is his the first dead _body_ thou wilt prepare?"

‘Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "Let it not seem grievous to thee, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! for if Keresâsp had not existed, and thus much work had not been done by him, which _has_ been stated, _there_ would have been no remains of thee, nor of any creature of mine."’

Besides the Persian paraphrase of this legend, in prose, the Persian Rivâyats contain another version in metre, which consists of 173 couplets [^60]. The exploits of Keresâsp are also mentioned in the Mainyô-i Khar<i>d</i> (XXV II, 49-53) as follows:--

‘And from Sâm the advantage was this, that by him the serpent Sruvar, the wolf Kapô<i>d</i> which they also call P<i>e</i>han [^61], the water-demon Ga<i>n</i>darfi, the bird Kamak [^62], and the bewildering [^63] demon _were_ slain. <span id="p382"><sup><small>[ p. 382 ]</small></sup></span> And also many other great actions, that _were_ more valuable, he performed; and he kept back much disturbance from the world, of which, if one of those special disturbances had remained behind, it would not have been possible to effect the resurrection and the future existence.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (369:1) See Yas. IX, 30, 31.

[^2]: (369:2) See Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 61, 136. Hence he is often called Sâm in Pahlavi works (see Bd. XXIX, 7, 9, Byt. III, 60, 61); and, in a passage interpolated in some manuscripts of the Shâhnâmah, we are informed that Gar<i>s</i>âsp was son of Atrat, son of Sam, which is evidently a reminiscence of Keresâsp being. a son of Thrita the Sâman (see also Bd. XXXI, 26, 27).

[^3]: (369:3) See Âbân Yt. 37, Râm Yt. 27, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 38, 40, 44. Hence we have Sâm, son of Narîmân, as the grandfather of Rustam in the Shâhnâmah.

[^4]: (369:4) See Yas. IX, 33. M. de Harlez converts the side-locks into some weapon called gaêsu<i>s</i>, but this word still survives in Pers. gês or gêsû, ‘ringlet, side-lock.’

[^5]: (369:5) See Vend. I, 36. Or it may be ‘the witch whom one destroys, or to whom one prays,’ if we translate the name.

[^6]: (369:6) See Vend. XIX, 18.

[^7]: (369:7) See Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 61. For the reason of this watchfulness, see Dd. XVII, 6 n.

[^8]: (370:1) See Yas. IX, 34—39, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 40 (translated in Haug's Essays, pp. 78, 179).

[^9]: (370:2) See Âbân Yt. 38, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 41. A monster in the wide-shored ocean, who is also mentioned in Râm Yt. 28.

[^10]: (370:3) See Râm Yt. 28, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 41.

[^11]: (370:4) See Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 41. For ‘Hunus’ some read 'sons:

[^12]: (370:5) See Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 41-44.

[^13]: (370:6) See Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 136.

[^14]: (370:7) The name of Yas. XLIV, being the first two words, a<i>d</i> fravakhshyâ, of that chapter of the Gâthas. In the detailed account of the contents of each fargar<i>d</i> of the first three Nasks, given in the ninth book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, each fargar<i>d</i> is distinguished p. 371 by the name of some section of the Gâthas. The names thus employed are composed of the first one, two, or three words of the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô, the Ashem-vohû, the YêNhê-hâtãm, Yas. XXVIII-XXXIV, the Yasna haptanghâiti, Yas. XLII-L, LII, LIII, which supply the twenty-two names required. When the Nask contains twenty-three fargar<i>d</i>s, as in the case of the Var<i>s</i>tmânsar, the first fargar<i>d</i> remains unnamed. Whether these words were used merely as names, or whether their insertion implies that the fargar<i>d</i>s of these Nasks used to be recited (somewhat like those of the Vendidâ<i>d</i>) alternately with the sections of the Gâthas, can hardly be determined from our present information. It may be noted that the three Nasks (Sû<i>d</i>kar, Var<i>s</i>tmânsar, and Bakô), whose contents are thus detailed in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, all belong to the so-called gâsânîk or Gâtha class of Nasks; but whether that term implies that they were metrical, or merely that they were connected in some way with the Gâthas, is also uncertain.

[^15]: (371:1) Written Kerê<i>s</i>âspô, or Gerê<i>s</i>âspô, throughout the Pahlavi text of this paragraph.

[^16]: (371:2) The Srvara of Yas. IX, 34, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 40.

[^17]: (371:3) The Ga<i>n</i>darewa of Âbân Yt. 38, Râm Yt. 28, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 41.

[^18]: (371:4) Reading Hunû Ve<i>s</i>kŏ, but it is also possible to read khûnŏ-dâkŏ, ‘blood-producing,’ which is fully applicable to these highway-robbers. The ‘Hunus in Vaêska’ are mentioned in Âbân Yt. 54, 57 as opponents of the warrior Tusa, but the Hunus in Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 41 have no country assigned to them.

[^19]: (372:1) The Nivika and Dâ<i>s</i>tayâni of Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 41.

[^20]: (372:2) The wind (vâ<i>d</i>ŏ), though an angel when moderate and useful, is supposed to become a demon in a gale or hurricane; and is mentioned as such in Vend. X, 24.

[^21]: (372:3) In the volcano, Mount Dimâvand (see Bd. XII, 31, XXIX, 9, Byt. III, 55-6 r). This exploit is expected to be performed hereafter.

[^22]: (372:4) The hamîstîkŏ ahvânŏ, intermediate between heaven and hell (see Dd. XX, 3).

[^23]: (372:5) The Pahlavi equivalent of the Av. ashem vohû, here translated, follows each summary of the contents of a fargar<i>d</i> or Nask in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, in the same way as ashem vohû follows each fargar<i>d</i> of the Vendidâ<i>d</i> and each section of the Gâthas in the Vendidâ<i>d</i> sâdah or liturgy.

[^24]: (373:1) In B29, fols. 167-169, where it is quoted from a work called the Sad-darband-i Hûsh.

[^25]: (373:2) In BK and J; but in K35 this portion of the Rivâyat has been lost, with the first 71 folios of that MS.; it also appears to have been similarly lost from the older MS. belonging to Mr. Tehmuras Dinshawji Anklesaria.

[^26]: (373:3) J omits this word.

[^27]: (373:4) J omits the seeing.

[^28]: (373:5) Kâbul. One of the three most sacred fires, the Frôbak fire, is said to have been removed by Vi<i>s</i>tâsp from Khvâri<i>z</i>em to Kâvulistân (see Bd. XVII, 6). The Persian version has ‘would to God (kâ<i>s</i>kê) I were a priest!’ and alters the rest of the sentence to correspond.

[^29]: (373:6) Reading rê-î li; J has 100 var, ‘a hundred lakes (or ordeals or results).’

[^30]: (374:1) Fire is often called ‘the son of Ahura-mazda’ in the Avesta, as in Yas: II, 18, Vend. V, 9, &c.

[^31]: (374:2) The Srvara of Yas. IX, 34, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 40. The Persian version has merely azdahâ, ‘a dragon.’

[^32]: (374:3) Or it may be shâk, ‘a bough.’ The Persian version has ‘eighty cubits.’

[^33]: (374:4) The Persian version adds ‘and as I looked into its mouth, men were still hanging about its teeth;’ which was evidently suggested by what is stated in the account of the next exploit.

[^34]: (374:5) See [p. 371](.), note 3.

[^35]: (375:1) The Persian version says ‘horses and asses.’

[^36]: (375:2) For this clause the Persian version substitutes ‘the sea was up to his knee, and his head up to the sun.’

[^37]: (375:3) This is merely a guess. The word can also be read khârvarag, ‘thorny, or a thorny brake;’ but it seems to be the name of some person, being followed by the word dôstŏ, ‘friend,’ in the next sentence. Âkhrûra, son of Haosravangh, is mentioned in Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 137, next after Sâma Keresâspa, as ‘withstanding Hashi-dava (or daêva), the wicked and covetous one destroying the world.’ The Persian version omits from the dragging out of the sea in this sentence to the slaying in the next (p. 376, line 1).

[^38]: (375:4) BK has ‘by me,’ which must be a blunder.

[^39]: (375:5) J omits these last seven words.

[^40]: (376:1) The Persian version says, ‘I slew him, and as he fell down many villages and places became desolate.’

[^41]: (376:2) The ‘nine highwaymen’ of Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 41. The Persian version says ‘seven.’ BK has ‘walked,’ instead of ‘slain.’

[^42]: (376:3) Instead of this sentence the Persian version has ‘through fear of them people could not go on any journey, and every one whom they might see, on the road that he went, they would instantly eat up; and in three years they reckoned three hundred thousand men they had slain and destroyed. And I fought with them and slew all the seven.’

[^43]: (376:4) J omits the word ‘fallen.’

[^44]: (377:1) The Persian version has ‘and as it arrived near me, it was not able to bear my foot from the spot; and I seized the spirit of the wind, and overthrew him with my own strength, until he made a promise thus: “I _will_ go again below the earth.” And I did not keep back my hand _from_ that work less than Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels ordered me.’

[^45]: (378:1) See Byt. III, 55-61. The Persian version substitutes a legend about the gigantic bird Kamak (also mentioned in Mkh. XXVII, 50) which overshadowed the earth, and kept off the rain till the rivers dried up; it also ate up men and animals as if they were grains of corn, until Keresâsp killed it by shooting it with arrows continuously for seven days and nights.

[^46]: (378:2) That is, when there is only light, and no darkness.

[^47]: (378:3) J has ‘I will sit and move alone within it;’ and the Persian version has ‘I will sit alone in that place.’

[^48]: (379:1) The Persian version does not mention the angels and the weeping.

[^49]: (379:2) This can also be translated thus: ‘Though thou shouldst be no deceiver, thou wouldst be a deceiver in _my_ eyes;’ the words hômanâye, ‘would be,’ and hômanê<i>s</i>, ‘thou wouldst be,’ being written alike.

[^50]: (379:3) The Persian version of this speech is, ‘O good creator! I know that hatred and anger are not in thy path, and when any one indulges in hatred of another, there is no acquiescence of thine therein, yet now I see this matter as though some one maintained hatred against another.’

[^51]: (379:4) The Persian version says ‘the archangel Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t,’ who is the protector of fire (see Sls. XV, 5, 12, 13).

[^52]: (379:5) The Persian version proceeds, and concludes the sentence, as follows: ‘and Keresâsp groaned unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân, and Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, said: "’O Zaratu<i>s</i>t! thou dost not know what Keresâsp has done unto me; that in the world, formerly, my custom and habit would have been so, that, as they would place firewood under a caldron, I would send the fire, until that caldron should be boiled, and their work should be completed, _and_ then it would have come back to its own place. As that serpent that he speaks of _was_ slain he became hungry, and because the fire fell one moment later upon the firewood which he had placed below the caldron, he smote the fire _with_ a club and scattered the fire, _and_ now I _will_ not pass the soul of Keresâsp to heaven."'

[^53]: (380:1) Av. g<i>e</i>u<i>s</i> urva, ‘the soul of the ox,’ that is, of the primeval ox, from which all the lower animals are supposed to have been developed. This angel, who is usually called Gô<i>s</i>, is said to be a female, and is the protectress of cattle (see Bd. IV, 2-5); in this capacity she is supposed to be friendly to Keresâsp, whose exploits had chiefly consisted in slaying the destroyers of animal life.

[^54]: (380:2) The Persian version omits these words, and the preceding paragraph, proceeding in continuation of note 5, p. 379, as follows: ‘And as Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, spoke these words, the soul of Keresâsp wept and said: "Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, speaks truly; I committed sin and I repent." And he touched the skirt of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _with his_ hand, and said: "Of mankind no one has obtained the eminence, rank, and dignity that thou obtainedst; now, through this grandeur and glory which is thine, do thou entreat and make intercession of Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, for me! so that it may be that I obtain liberation from this distress and torment."’

[^55]: (380:3) See Dd. XXXVII, 36.

[^56]: (380:4) See Dd. XLIV, r6.

[^57]: (380:5) The Persian version continues as follows: ‘And as Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân made intercession, Ardîbahi<i>s</i>t, the archangel, said: “Thy reputation is immense, and thy will is great.” And after that he made no opposition to the soul of Keresâsp, but pardoned _it_ for Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân; and the soul of Keresâsp obtained liberation from that discomfort.’ This version then concludes with an admonition as to the necessity of treating fire with proper respect.

[^58]: (381:1) J omits the following words as far as the next ‘thus.’

[^59]: (381:2) Referring to the revival of Keresâsp from his trance, in order to destroy Dahâk, which is expected to take place before the general resurrection (see Bd. XXIX, 8, Byt. III, 59—61).

[^60]: (381:3) In B29, fols. 169-171, it is quoted from ‘the book of Bahirâm Fîrûz.’

[^61]: (381:4) Written Pêhînŏ, or Pa<i>s</i>înŏ, in the Pahlavi text.

[^62]: (381:5) See p. 378, note 1.

[^63]: (381:6) Or ‘seducing,’ or ‘desolating.’
