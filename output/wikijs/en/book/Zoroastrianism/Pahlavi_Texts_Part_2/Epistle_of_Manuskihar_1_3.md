## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. CHAPTER III.

1\. This, too, I am begging of you, that _you_ may be desiring the truth, and _that_ Vohûman [^2], who, <span id="p287"><sup><small>[ p. 287 ]</small></sup></span> when a ruler (shah) of yours, is an interpreter (pâ<i>k</i>ûkŏ) about the writing which [^1] I write, _may_ as regardfully _and_ accommodatingly observe _and_ direct as the variety of dispositions _permits_. 2. For you are of like opinion with me, to inform again the most initiated [^2]; so that I am more steadfastly-determined (aûstîkânŏ-mini<i>s</i>ntar) thereon. 3. And if there be _anything_ that seems to you otherwise, direct _some one_ to point _it_ out again, with the reason _for_ maintaining _it_ which occurs to you, just as a household companion is a responder _and_ has spoken again for the sake of pointing out again; for there are many reasons, on account of which your kindly-regardful observation is needful, which are to be written about.

4\. The first is this, that the penmanship of the spirits is not the profession of me and others [^3]; _and as to_ him by whom a theory (farhâng) not universally operating is disseminated, which is _distinct_ from his more indispensable occupation, _there_ is then no command for his teaching _and_ apostleship therein. 5. On that account, too, the wise _and_ the seekers for truth uphold the' body of opinion about the statements of the writing of the spirits [^4], and, therefore, direct less of the ingenuity of preparing again the penmanship of various tidings.

6\. The second is this, that, in the distress (dahyakŏ) of this grievous time, he to whom <span id="p288"><sup><small>[ p. 288 ]</small></sup></span> adherence _and_ much indebtedness even as to his _fore_fathers _have_ remained, is well-lamenting, owing to the proposals (dâ<i>d</i>anŏ) of the unfriendly, and much harm has occurred through the conflicting (âr<i>d</i>îkŏ) offer of remedies _and_ lawful provision of means, full of trouble, except, indeed, to the upholder of religion who is more worldly-managing and investigation by opponents is grievous danger full of things inopportune _and_ unnecessary for accomplishment [^1].

7\. The third is this, that a wise _man_ who is a high-priest of the spirit-retaining [^2] religion _and_ acquainted with opinions, when also himself properly humble, fearless, and benedictive in the world, is then even, owing to his estimating [^3] pardonings _and_ long-_continued_ dexterity (dêr zîva<i>k</i>akîh), united with the good creations in affliction _and_ vexation. 8. And, on account of information about the worldly _and_ spiritual misery of former evils of many kinds--always as much in the religion, _and_ in the thoughts of others [^4], as _one_ delivers up his heart to ingenious verbiage and for the preparation of phrases--he speaks as in the question in revelation, thus [^5]: ‘“Who in the bodily existence <span id="p289"><sup><small>[ p. 289 ]</small></sup></span> is more quickly fortunate?” _and_ it is answered thus: "“The youth who is observant _and_ humble, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! who, as regards both that which has happened and that _which_ happens, also sees that which is evil and good with gratitude, just like that also which _happens_ unto another;”"’ because he knows this, that from this is a benefit, for he knows happiness and also misery [^1]. 9. The glorified leader of those of the good religion, Hêr-Frôvag [^2], son of Farukhûzâ<i>d</i>, wrote: ‘It is he understands the consequence of his own action; and _it_ is his great household attendant, and the worldly desire provided at the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge [^3] becomes less watchful.’

10\. The fourth is this, that I _am_ more universally hoping about the property of the profession _and_ the much duty fit for the truly wise, _in_ such manner as even that _in_ which the glorified and greatly-learned leader of those of the good religion, Yûdân-Yim [^4], son of Shahpûhar, always urged on a priestly man with many sons _and_ equally clever [^5] discourse. <span id="p290"><sup><small>[ p. 290 ]</small></sup></span> 11\. That _was_ through my instigation, alone and with little assistance, in the beginning; and, on account of the deficiency of warriors [^1], the abundance of opponents, the very rapid arrival of disturbance, _and_ the fourfold supplication for keeping away the ruin _or_ hasty unlawful maintenance _of_ the fires _of_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, my constant distress is such that most of my time speaks of the same subject [^2]. 12. They may leave the abundance of despondency and thoughtfulness of the bodily existence to such remedial writing of his, unto whom the pleasantly comfortable thought of an evaded (vîrikhtô) seizure is requisite, but _there_ is little worldly leisure for me for writing more _in_ this direction (hanâ-runtar). 13. And specially in this passing _time_\--when, alike limited by the coming of the period of giving daily _supplies_ to the performers of worship, _and by_ the ever-triumphant fire and _its_ produce [^3], it was necessary for me to go to Shirâ<i>z</i> [^4] on account of some indispensable provision of means--the work was much _and_ the leisure little. <span id="p291"><sup><small>[ p. 291 ]</small></sup></span> 14\. The fifth is this, that the custom of providing for all the duties even of the _sacred_ fire (âtû<i>r</i>) by me, and my own desire [^1], trained hand [^2], unhardened mind, and unhardened heart _for_ managing many _things_ should have become the joy of _my_ mind. 15. Then, too, from _having_ read such writing _and_ such news the healer of distress would be thoroughly connected with my heart and mind, _owing_ to which my intellect would have become quickly fatigued (mândakŏ) by a limited preparation of phrases.

16\. The sixth is this, that even he who is a rescued [^3] _and_ better-operating (hû-dâgtar) man--when, owing to the writing of a learned _man_ of the realm who is desiring the truth, _he_ is so perplexed [^4] on account of a doubt of increasing the after-tearing of the same perplexity--_has_ no doubt of the falsity and little training existent in the worldly.

17\. The seventh is this, that if none of these six _of_ which I _have_ written should exist, even then your approved cleverness (<i>s</i>îvagdârîh), extolled freedom from strife, hereafter-discerning and complete mindfulness, <span id="p292"><sup><small>[ p. 292 ]</small></sup></span> practised [^1] attention to the good, and much affection [^2] for the faithful--so kindly regarding, truly judging, _and_ with a liking for praising (srî<i>d</i>anŏ), as regards whatever I write truly _and_ with true conviction--are, I consider, to make provision, and _have_ realised a preparation striven for.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (286:2) The archangel personifying ‘good thought’ (see Dd. III, 13).

[^1]: (287:1) Reading î instead of va, ‘and.’

[^2]: (287:2) That is, to severely admonish their high-priest, as he does in Ep. II.

[^3]: (287:3) That is, he disclaims all pretensions to inspiration on the part of himself and his contemporaries.

[^4]: (287:4) The inspired scriptures.

[^1]: (288:1) Referring to the risk of unfriendly and destructive criticism of the scriptures.

[^2]: (288:2) J has ‘spirit-observing,’ by changing gîri<i>s</i>nŏ into nigîri<i>s</i>nŏ.

[^3]: (288:3) Reading andasîh; the reference being to the sympathy acquired by a high-priest through performing his duty of appointing atonements for sins confessed to him.

[^4]: (288:4) Assuming that aî<i>s</i>anŏ stands for aî<i>s</i>ânŏ.

[^5]: (288:5) J. has only ‘as _one_ speaks out his heart for ingenious verbiage and phrases, thus.’ The question and reply here quoted seen to be no longer extant in the Avesta.

[^1]: (289:1) It is doubtful whether this last clause be a portion of the quotation, or not.

[^2]: (289:2) This name is corrupted into Hê-Fôrvag in the MSS., but Âtûr-Frôbag is probably intended. He was the compiler of a great part of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, and is also mentioned in Dd. LXXXVIII, 8. The names Atûr and Hêr are synonymous, both meaning ‘fire.’ The passage quoted in the text has the same form (beginning with the word hôman<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘it is’) as nearly all the sections of the third book of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, but it has not yet been discovered among them.

[^3]: (289:3) Here written <i>K</i>i<i>s</i>\-vi<i>d</i>arg (see Dd. XX, 3).

[^4]: (289:4) So written in J, but K35 and BK have the syllable din somewhat corrupted. The person meant, both here and in Chap. VII, 5, was probably the author's father, though Bd. XXXIII, 11 seems to make Yûdân-Yim the son of Vâhrâm-shâ<i>d</i>.

[^5]: (289:5) Reading ham-gôkŏ, but J has ham-dû<i>d</i>akŏ, ‘of the same family;’ it also omits several other words by mistake.

[^1]: (290:1) From this and Ep. II, v, 14 it would appear that the priests at that time maintained a body of troops for the protection of their followers.

[^2]: (290:2) That is, regarding the proper maintenance of the priesthood, which had already engaged his anxious attention during the life-time of his father.

[^3]: (290:3) The word var may either mean ‘ashes’ (see Sls. II, 49), alluding to clearing out, the fire, or it may mean ‘ordeal’ (see Sls. XIII, 17).

[^4]: (290:4) See Dd. I, 17. This name is written Shirâ<i>z</i>ŏ once, Sîrâ<i>z</i>ŏ thrice, and Sirâ<i>z</i>ŏ four times in K35. Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar appears to have come to Shirâ<i>z</i> on this occasion to hold a general assembly of the priests and leading members of the community, and he wrote this epistle from that city (see Ep: II, i, 11;. v, 10).

[^1]: (291:1) Reading kâmakŏ, instead of the unintelligible kâmûn.

[^2]: (291:2) The MSS. omit the last letter of yadman.

[^3]: (291:3) That is, delivered from contamination or sin; virikhtô is probably to be traced to Av. vi+irikhta, rather than to vi+rikhta (Pers. gurêkht).

[^4]: (291:4) K35 has a blank space here, and again a few words further on, but it is doubtful if any words be missing, The spaces are filled up in J and BK, apparently by guess, as follows: J has ‘he sees so perplexing a chance, concerning which, owing to the increase of after-tearing of the same perplexity and the arrival of evil, _he_ is doubtful, _has_ no doubt,’ &e. And BK has ‘_he_ is so perplexed on account of no doubt of the falsity _and_ little training _that_ existed in the worldly for increasing the after-tearing of the same perplexity, _has_ no doubt, &c.’

[^1]: (292:1) J has bûr<i>z</i>îdakŏ, ‘extolled,’ instead of var<i>z</i>îdakŏ, ‘practised.’

[^2]: (292:2) Reading dûkhsharmîh as in J; the other MSS. have m instead. of û.
