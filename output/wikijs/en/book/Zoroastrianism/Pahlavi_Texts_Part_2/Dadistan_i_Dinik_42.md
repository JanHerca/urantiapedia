## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XLII.

1\. _As to_ the forty-first question and reply, that which you ask is thus: _As to_ him who remains in the good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, _whom_ men shall make the protection and assistance of the good religion [^1], _who_ shall save men from a foreign faith and irreligion (akdînôîh), and then holds back _some_ of those who have the idea that they should go over to a foreign faith and irreligion, _and_ they do not go over to the foreign faith, _but_ become steadfast in the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, what is then [^2] the <span id="p140"><sup><small>[ p. 140 ]</small></sup></span> nature of the decision of the angels _about_ him, and what is the nature of their (the men's) good works _and_ sin?

2\. The reply is this, that _he_ is much extolled, happy, exalted, of great good works _and_ abundant recompense, and the path to the best existence, prepared (frârâstŏ) by his righteousness, is wide [^3]; the delight of _his_ soul becomes complete, _and its_ hope [^4] is great. 3. And every good work that is manifested in the good religion by those who are transferred by him from a foreign faith and irreligion, and _which_ they shall do thereafter—when, through the perseverance _and_ praise exercised by him who is protected by the religion, they are saved _from_ irreligion—becomes his as much as though it had been set going by him himself, and _he has_ the same praise and the same good works with them. 4. Of the extent (sâmânŏ) _and_ amount of such good works _there_ is no writing a second time, unless _his_ acquaintance with the full computation of the good works due to _their_ number is continuous [^5]; but when _in_ the same way they are practising and steadfast in sin it shall not be assigned _to him_ [^6]. 5. Then his position in <span id="p141"><sup><small>[ p. 141 ]</small></sup></span> righteousness [^7] is very grand, and in the world he has himself great eminence, applause, _and_ dignity.

6\. And as much as that which is an improper law _and_ a law worthy of death is a punishing of the soul, and the disconnected [^8] words and perversion (va<i>s</i>takîh), due also to the perfidy (rangi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the fiend _who has_ come, are such that in his time the religious rites (dînô) performed are rites of grievous vexation _and_ fear, _so_ that which is a proper law, like the great glorification in spirit and the connected words of the high-priests, is the arrival of the good spirit as much as a virtue worthy of recompense _and_ full of hope. 7. Even as that which is said thus: ‘Of men who are practisers of good deeds the manifestation is then in their children.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (139:4) Some one placed in authority, such as a high-priest or judge, is evidently meant.

[^2]: (139:5) Reading êdîna<i>s</i>, ‘then of him,’ instead of ayûf, ‘or;’ the p. 140 two words being alike in Pahlavi except in the latter part of the last letter.

[^3]: (140:1) That is, his path to heaven over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge is rendered wide and easy by his good deeds (see Chap. XXI, 5).

[^4]: (140:2) Reading aîmê<i>d</i>; M14 has khîm, ‘disposition,’ and K35 has khimâ<i>d</i>, which suggests ‘shall be greatly celebrated’ as a possible translation.

[^5]: (140:3) The meaning appears to be that their good works are imputed to him only so long as he continues to exercise some control over them.

[^6]: (140:4) That is, their sins will not be imputed to him in the same way as their good works.

[^7]: (141:1) Or, perhaps, aharûbŏîh may here mean ‘the righteous existence’ or heaven.

[^8]: (141:2) Reading apa<i>d</i>vand, instead of va pa<i>d</i>vand.
