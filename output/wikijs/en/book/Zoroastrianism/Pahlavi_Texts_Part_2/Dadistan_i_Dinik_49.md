### Chapter XLIX.

1\. _As to_ the forty-eighth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: _As to them_ who shall buy corn and keep _it_ in store until it shall become dear, _and_ shall then sell it at a high price (pavan girânŏîh), what is the nature of the decision?

2\. The reply is this, that when there is nothing therein on account of which I _should_ so deem [^1] _it_ otherwise than due to the eating of the requisite amount (a<i>v</i>âyi<i>s</i>n) of food for one's self, that which is his controlling impulse (sa<i>r</i>dârîh), and not the teachings of the worthy _and_ good, is the internal instruction which a time of scarcity _has_ taught by means of the occurrences during that time [^2]; but clamorous worldly profit is want of diligence (akhapârakânîh), for they would buy to make people distressed, and in order that they may sell again dearer. 3. Moreover, the store _one_ keeps, and keeps as closed even unto the good as unto the bad—_and_ though it be necessary for a man of the good _and_ worthy, and they beg for _some_ of the food, they shall not sell at the price it is worth at that time, on account of _its_ becoming dearer—_one_ keeps in store unauthorisedly _and_ grievously sinfully, _and_ every calamity _of_ those good people they shall suffer who would not sell it at the price they beg. <span id="p175"><sup><small>[ p. 175 ]</small></sup></span> 4\. On account of that non-obtainment of corn, or that unlawfully heinous sin, and because of dearness of price it is not proper to give _it_ for that non-distribution (an-af<i>s</i>ânŏîh) unto _him_ himself, or those under _his_ control, or the poor to whom it would be given by him [^3]; and the distribution (reshi<i>s</i>nŏ) _which_ occurs is then retaliative upon him. 5. And if the corn be spoiled [^4], through keeping too long a time in store, _he_ is suffering assault from the hungry _man_ (gûr<i>s</i>nŏ) who is injured even by that damaging (bô<i>d</i>yôzê<i>d</i>îh) [^5] of the corn; if through that un-lawful want of preservation (adâri<i>s</i>nŏîh) noxious creatures are associated with the corn, he is overwhelmed also by that heinous sin; _and_, through the profit of improper diligence _he_ is unworthy.

6\. But if it be necessary for their own people who are under their control, on account of the fear _of_ a time of scarcity, they should buy at their own suitable time, and should afford protection. 7. Or, because of the teachings of the good _and_ worthy, they should buy corn at a cheap price from a place where the corn is more than the requirements of the eaters, _and_ they should bring _it_ unto there where corn is scarce, provided (va hatŏ) the good _and_ those requiring corn are sufficient (vasân). 8. So that, while their information of a scarcity of corn is even <span id="p176"><sup><small>[ p. 176 ]</small></sup></span> from him himself to whom the price would become profit [^6], or _is_ the persistence of _these_ same teachings of the good—so that it may become more abundant unto them than unto the bad, even in the time of scarcity _when_ it is very much raised in price [^7]\—they should buy corn _at_ a cheap price during an excess of corn, so that _one_ may keep _it_ until the time of a period of scarcity. 9. When _there_ occurs a necessity for it _among_ the good he sells _it_ at _such_ price as _one_ buys it at that time, that is, the market price (ar<i>g</i>\-î shat<i>r</i>ôîk) [^8]; by that means, in a season of scarcity, much more is obtained in price, _and_ it becomes more plentiful among the good; then a more invigorating (pa<i>d</i>îkhûînagtar) praise of him is commendable.

10\. And, yet, as regards that which is suitable profit—and also apart from the eating of corn, _from_ anything eatable for the maintenance of life, _from_ medicine and remedies for the healthfulness of life, and _from_ whatever is for the preservation of life—it is allowable _that_ they shall buy _and_ shall sell dear [^9].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (174:1) K35 has a blank space for this word, but it is given in M14, and also occurs in a similar phrase in Chap. LIV, 6.

[^2]: (174:2) That is, so long as one does not lay in a store more than sufficient for one's own requirements, it is only an act of prudence taught by former experience,

[^3]: (175:1) That is, corn is not to be sold to a man who keeps it in store for the purpose of raising the price, nor to his people, nor is it even to be given to the poor whom he relieves, so that he may be compelled to support them out of his own stores, as a penalty.

[^4]: (175:2) Reading tapâhî-aît, as in M14.

[^5]: (175:3) Literally ‘destroying the consciousness,’ or ‘injuring the existence.’ Bô<i>d</i>yôzê<i>d</i> is a technical name for sins whereby animals are ill-treated, or useful property injured (see Sls. II, 39).

[^6]: (176:1) And, therefore, likely to be correct, as it is given in opposition to his own interest.

[^7]: (176:2) M14 has ‘begged at a price,’ by inserting a stroke.

[^8]: (176:3) Without holding it back for an exorbitant rise in prices.

[^9]: (176:4) That is, there is no harm in speculating upon prices, except in the case of necessaries of life.
