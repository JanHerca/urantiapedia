## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXXVIII.

1\. _As to_ the eighty-seventh question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: _As_ family householders we of the good religion of Irân, before each _celebration of_ all the religious rites with holy-water [^1] which they have provided in the land [^2] of Pârs, have then always given for it a gift of 400 dirhams, _or_ 350 dirhams [^3] _at_ least. 2. And now if _we_ should be needy, when we deduct something from the 400 dirhams, or from the 350 dirhams, of the gift for them, they would then not accept _it_ from us, and speak thus: ‘Less than 400, or than 350, dirhams we do not [^4] accept.’ 3. _But_ there are needy _men_  <span id="p251"><sup><small>[ p. 251 ]</small></sup></span> who always come to us themselves and speak thus: ‘For 350 dirhams we will always twice conduct all the religious rites _and_ ceremonial with holy-water such as _those_ which you have always ordered before for 400; only order us.’ 4. Would a needy _one, apart_ from the priestly men _who_ always say that they are not, be authorised, or not?

5\. The reply is this, that the priest _to whom your_ predecessors _have_ given a gift of 400 or 350 _dirhams_, for all the religious rites with holy-water, it is proper to consider particularly virtuous _and_ faithful, when there is nothing else _about_ him, on account of which he is otherwise: 6. A _celebration of_ all the religious rites with holy-water, in which they shall use four pure animals [^5]\--_and_ just according to the teaching of the high-priests they present _to_ every single fire from one animal _and_ one holy-water--and the offering of holy-water unto the fire whose holy-water _it is_, and bringing it on to another fire _apart_ from that holy-water, and the _ceremonial_ cleansing of the holy-water they maintain by agreement in thy name, the superiors solemnize with approval, faithfully, and attentively; _and_ the remuneration of 350 dirhams would be a balancing of when they conduct the religious rite _at_ the place of undertaking _it, and_ when _it_ is undertaken as regards a distant district [^6].

7\. In A<i>r</i>takhshatar-gadman [^7], within my memory, <span id="p252"><sup><small>[ p. 252 ]</small></sup></span> they who would accept less than 300 dirhams [^8] for it made a memorandum (farhâng), to keep in remembrance _that_ 350 dirhams for all the religious rites performed _was_ to be the rule declared by those of the religion _in_ A<i>r</i>takhshatar-gadman. 8. Likewise, the glorified Atû<i>r</i>\-frôbag [^9], _son_ of Farâkhûzâ<i>d</i>, who was the pre-eminent leader of those of the good religion, decided _in_ the same manner.

9\. And now, too, they always conduct those _rites_ which are without holy-water for 150 dirhams, _or_ even for 120 dirhams [^10]; and the reason of it is the neediness of the disciples who, owing to that need, _and_ in hope of obtaining more employment, always diminish _their demands, and_ through deficient remuneration always become more needy, more importunate, and more moderate in desiring remuneration; and, in the course _of_ the employment of resources and requesting _the charge of_ all the religious rites, the labour and endurance of discipleship are exhausted.

10\. And _as to_ him who undertakes to conduct all the religious rites twice for 350 dirhams, if _he be_ properly working _and_ thoroughly reliable _for_ the 350 dirhams _which_ are always given him for the ceremonial of all the religious rites--just like those who would always undertake _them_ once--and all the religious rites are conducted _and_ secured twice, on <span id="p253"><sup><small>[ p. 253 ]</small></sup></span> account of the merit due to the continuous ceremonial of the sacred beings it is more authorisedly ordered of those who solemnize all the religious rites twice [^11]. 11. But _as_ to _him_ who would under-take all the religious rites twice for 350 dirhams, _but_ is not able to conduct _them_ unless he puts to it _some_ of his own wealth, so that the progress _may be_ acceptable to him as they conduct _them_ through repetition, he should not undertake _them_ owing to the reasons written in another chapter of ours [^12], since _it tends_ much more to neediness.

12\. And more like unto the ancient sceptics (vimânakŏ) _have_ become the disciples, among whom disagreement _and_ enmity are produced, as is written in the same writing (khadû-gûn nâmakŏ) [^13]; _and_, owing to admonishing words, these _become_ enviousness and maliciousness unto the disciples, _and_ trouble _and_ disagreement less becoming among you and more contentious about you. 13. And at the time _in_ which a great stipend existed, _they_ contended with him through whose greatness _and_ abundance of stipend their conflict was caused, one with the other, through envy; and now, too, they [always](errata_htm.html) squabble _about_ his deficient stipend, by which they will tempt them, on account of _its_ inadequacy, for the sake of a way for preserving life, as was shown by my metaphor in the other chapter [^14]. 14. When those who, through need of _employment in the rites_ of religion, or the recitations [^15] <span id="p254"><sup><small>[ p. 254 ]</small></sup></span> which are its wisdom, would at once produce enmity, and the friends of religion, are for each _of_ two sides, _it_ is important to look to the procuring of forgiveness, kind regards, and the progress of the elect (pasandakânŏ) in the duty of the faithful.
