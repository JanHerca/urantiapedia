## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LIII.

1\. _As to_ the fifty-second question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: _If_ people of the good religion, in _their_ country _or_ out of _their_ country, shall buy _and_ sell with those of a different religion as regards cattle, _or_ shall lay hold of traders (vanîkgarân) and shall sell to them, what is then the decision about it? 2. When _those of_ the good religion shall not buy, as they have not come _up to_ the price, but _the orthodox dealers_ shall sell to traders _and_ those of a different religion, what is then the decision about it? 3. _And_ about him, of whom the means of existence (zîvi<i>s</i>nŏ mindavam) are such, what is then the decision?

4\. The reply is this, that it would be very grievously sinful, and it would be an evil occupation to transact such business through the influence of opportunity, _and_ to seek profit unauthorisedly in that manner. 5. But if _it be_ the means of existence _of_ those of the good religion _of_ whom _you have_ written, and _they_ are not able to seek _it_ in any other business _and_ proper occupation which _would be_ a less sinful meant of existence, complete [^1] purchasers who _have_ acquired <span id="p183"><sup><small>[ p. 183 ]</small></sup></span> the good religion shall sell unto those of the good religion [^2]; because it is possible for him _to be_ less sinful _to_ whom _it_ is allowable to beg the life of a comrade, for still the rule _of_ a righteous man, with the righteous who are in his guardianship, is to live. 6. So it is possible, when they shall sell cattle for slaughter _and_ foreign eating, many cattle--amounting even to a diminution of the maintenance of Irân--are more wretched than a righteous man forced to kill _them_ through a living becoming unobtainable _and_ the fear of death.
