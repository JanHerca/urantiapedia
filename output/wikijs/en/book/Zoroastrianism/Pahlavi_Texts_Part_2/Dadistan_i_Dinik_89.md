## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXXIX.

1\. _As to_ the eighty-eighth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: When a man resolves within himself thus: ‘_In_ the summer [^1] time I _will_ go into Pârs, and will give so much money for the high-priesthood, on account of the fires _and_ other matters which are as greatly advantageous,’ though he himself does not come into Pârs, _but_ sends the money according to his intention, _or_ in excess of it, unto the high-priests--so that he is like the great _who_ send in excess of that unto the high-priests [^2]\--that, as the benefit is greater which is more maintained, they may provide for the fires of every kind _and_ other matters, is then his proceeding of sending to Pârs, for that purpose, a sin, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that if his coming be indispensable for the design he would undertake, then it is indispensable for him to accomplish his own mental undertaking; but in suffering which is excited _and_ not avoidable, when _there_ is really no possibility <span id="p255"><sup><small>[ p. 255 ]</small></sup></span> of his travelling himself, any one whom he sends in his place, more particularly on _that_ account, is not acceptable by the approval of the angels who _have_ realized the affliction in _his_ good thought, but the good work is to be eagerly well-considered. 3. Good gifts, and every office (gâs) about good works which it is possible to perform, are what are commendable _in_ the well-housed _man_ that is not able to work _himself_ [^3]_; they are_ avoidable by him when not of good race, and are not indispensable for him whenever the good work is not announced. 4. When able to manage _it_ himself _it_ is better; and when otherwise, his appointment of a faithful _person_ over _its_ preparation, and _his_ accomplishment of the work of selector are expedient.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (254:1) Assuming that hâmân stands for hâmînô.

[^2]: (254:2) M14 omits this phrase.

[^3]: (255:1) M14 adds, ‘he longs for good giving and good consideration; important and virtuous is he when able to do it;’ but the sentence is hardly grammatical.
