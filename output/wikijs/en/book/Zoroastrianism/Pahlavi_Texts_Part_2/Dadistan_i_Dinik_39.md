## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXXIX.

1\. _As to_ the thirty-eighth question and reply, that which you ask is thus What are the reason and cause of tying _on_ the _sacred thread_\-girdle (kûstîkŏ) [^1] which, when they shall tie _it_ on is said _to be_ so greatly valuable, and when they shall not tie _it_ the sin is so grievous?

2\. The reply is this, that the all-good, most spiritual of spirits, and most ruling of rulers is the creator, and there is no need of troubles for men of the poor as to any wealth _or_ anything, for all are his own. 3. And through his will _as_ ruler, and all-powerful, he demands this of men, to remain properly <span id="p123"><sup><small>[ p. 123 ]</small></sup></span> skirted [^2] as a true servant not even bound—which is due to that service, and also the indication of a servant—as is seen _and_ clearly declared in the ever-fixed (hamâî-dâ<i>d</i>ŏ) religion and belief.

4\. Formerly men paid homage through the will and worship, as _it were_ more effectually, more essentially, _and_ more suitably for the discreet; and every day _spent_ in worship offered and homage paid they account as _of_ the greatest use, particularly for observing the world, and understanding _its_ character. 5. And _as to him_ of whose offering of homage no worldly advantage whatever is apparent—as fruit is apparent from trees, flavour from foods, fragrance from aromatic herbs, tint (bâm) from colours, the good quality of spears from the forest, health from the patient (môlvarakân), and decision from words—but, audibly speaking, _his_ head is lowered in sign of humility—as though the head, which is uppermost in the body and in the most pre-eminent _position_, and is lowered as far even as the sole of the foot, which is lowermost in the body, salutes [^3] _and_ is placed on the ground in thought about worship _and_ desire of paying homage—and the appearance which exists as regards himself through _that_ lowliest (kîhastŏ) servitude is _in accordance_ with that which is apparent from trees, food, and the many other worldly advantages _before_ recited—whoever _has_ offered homage and such advantageous (vê<i>s</i>i<i>s</i>nakŏ) appearance <span id="p124"><sup><small>[ p. 124 ]</small></sup></span> is manifest—even then that sign of humility _and_ servitude is _what_ great multitudes consider the offering of homage of a man more essential for hypocrisy (shêdŏ) [^4].

6\. _But_ owing to that which _happens_ when they plant a tree in the name of a sacred being [^5] and eat the produce, and practise other worldly labour of worldly advantage, owing also to work of this kind through the doing of which they preserve all the growing _crops_ of the whole world, and through tillage and multitudinous cultivated plots (khûstakîhâ) _it_ is manifest that they should meditate inwardly (dên mînŏyên) [^6]. 7. A token _and_ sign of worship is _of_ great use, and a great assistance (ban<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) therein is this belt (band), which is called the Kûstîk, that is tied on the middle of the body.

8\. The reasons of the assistance are numerous; and its first assistance is this, that _as to_ him who—_as_ a worshipper of the sacred beings, owing to the undeceitful (akadbâ) religion whose indication is sagaciously propitiating with the _purifying_ cup [^7]\—wears upon the body that spiritual, customary, and <span id="p125"><sup><small>[ p. 125 ]</small></sup></span> doctrinal indication of the sacred beings with a wisdom which is truly religion, _his_ steadfastness and religious service of the sacred beings are audibly spoken thereby; even for the religious _it_ is commanded, because _it_ is an assisting motive of beneficial high-priests and such-like submitters _to_ the commands of the religion of the sacred beings.

9\. One is this, that, as the lowliest servant and greatest lord are steadily agreed, and _it is_ beneficial [^8] when they (the servants) wear a belt upon the body _as_ a sign of service—because _it_ is not the custom to grant that little at any time without guardianship—the lapse of which service is also not a beneficial lapse, then those unbound are without a token of the lord's service.

10\. One is this, that it is commanded in revelation to keep thought, word, and deed confined from sin by a belt, and just like a servant; for the sake of confinement of sins from purity of thought, whose dwelling is the heart, _one_ is to wear the same belt, which is the token of a servant, _on_ the middle of the body and before the heart; and the periodical (hangâmîkânŏ) sight of the token and sign of confined sins, and of the constant reminder for _one's_ own mind, is the necessity of wearing _it_ as a belt which is very restraining from the sin in thought, word, and deed that is manifest even in experience; which wearing of the same belt is as a reason and cause of much remembrance of much sin, that in the same way is therefore a restraint of it.

II. One is this, that the ancients acquainted with religion _have_ communicated these tidings (srôbŏ) <span id="p126"><sup><small>[ p. 126 ]</small></sup></span> unto our ancestors _and_ to us:--‘When the destroyer came upon the creatures, the demons and witches (parîkŏ) especially rushed up in the earth and atmosphere, and even to _just_ below the position of the stars; and they saw multitudes of luminaries, and also the barricade _and_ rampart [^9] of the glory of the religion, and the girdle (parvand) [^10] of the wishes _and_ good works of all, when [^11] it is arrayed like a brilliant _thread_\-girdle (kûstîk), and all its luminaries are girded (parvastŏ) by the girdle as the girdle of the omniscient wisdom has girded the all-intelligent angels.’ 12. That great glory of the pure religion, solving doubts, became as beautiful and far-adorning as is stated in the liturgy (mânsar) thus: ‘The star-studded girdle (ayî<i>v</i>yahângânŏ) of the spirit-fashioned, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers [^12].’ 13. All the demons and fiends _were_ terrified by the great glory of the religion, _and it is_ said that, by the recital, practice, _and_ promulgation of the whole routine of the enlightened religion, all those fiends are subdued, _and_ the renovation _of the universe_ is produced by the will of the patron spirits (ahvân). 14. Likewise, on account of that terror, none of the demons and fiends, who are the mightiest of the demons, rushed upon the creatures of that uppermost third _of the sky_ [^13], who are in purity and indestructibility. <span id="p127"><sup><small>[ p. 127 ]</small></sup></span> 15. And it (the girdle) is commanded in revelation for men, more particularly for upholders of the religion [^14], _to be_ within the middle third _and_ near to the uppermost third of the body [^15].

16\. _One is_ this, that Yim the splendid, _son_ of Vîvangha [^16], who in _his_ worldly career was most prosperous in worldly affairs, a keeper away of all agitations of temper [^17] _and_ all death, _and_ a provider of freedom from decay _and_ exemption from death, when he was deceived by the fiend _was_ thereby made eager for supreme sovereignty instead of the service of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 17. And about his administration (dâ<i>d</i>ârîh) of the creatures _it_ is said he himself became cut [^18] away from radiant glory by that fiendishness [^19], and their cause of wandering <span id="p128"><sup><small>[ p. 128 ]</small></sup></span> (garîni<i>s</i>nŏ) is the demon, and mankind perishes in that wandering from plain and hill-side [^20]. 18. And his pardon originated from the fully-persistent creator; therefore he spoke _and_ gave advice unto his successors as to the retribution of those _who_ shall abandon the service of the creator; and therein is explained about the fortress of the angels [^21], with the many proper actions which are the strength of the fortress, and about the proportional way it is strengthened when a belt worn on the waist is ordered for men _by_ him—the fully glorious ruler who was lord of the world, and also in gloriousness well-betokening the good creation—_and_ they [^22] likewise order _it_.

19\. One is this, that just as through that reason [^23], which is an appointment (pa<i>d</i>ŏ-dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) that the sacred beings decreed, the _sacred thread_\-girdle _was_ worn even before the coming of Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân, _so_ after _the coming of_ that messenger (vakh<i>s</i>var) of the sacred beings, the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t—who enjoined the commands of the good spirits _and_ the exposition of the religion, with discourse praising the sacred beings and scriptures (a<i>v</i>îstâkŏ) about steadfastness in the good religion—the same religious girdle is put on, with a religious formula [^24], around <span id="p129"><sup><small>[ p. 129 ]</small></sup></span> the body, over the garment of Vohûman [^25]. 20. Because the same intimation, relative to girding (parvandi<i>s</i>nîk) is wisdom for which the race of the religion is so justly famed that innumerable people, with the same customs _and_ equally proper girding, wear the _sacred thread_\-girdle, the ceremonial belt of the religion _and_ indication of the creator, on the middle of the body; _and_ it becomes more destructive of the power of destruction [^26], more obstructive of the way to sin, and more contesting (kastaktar) the will of the demons.

21\. One is this, that _he_ is unwise that _has_ not worn _it_ when that _man has_ arrived in whose law no belting and no girdling [^27] are ordered, and more perplexing and more grievous destruction is so manifested at the time, that _it_ is similar evidence to that exposition of revelation, the purport (aêvâ<i>z</i>) of _whose_ question _and_ reply is spoken thus [^28]:--‘“O creator! in whom is the manifestation of secretly-progressing destruction, that is, in whom is its progress [^29]?” And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: “In him who is the guide of a vile religion; whoever it is who puts on a girdle <span id="p130"><sup><small>[ p. 130 ]</small></sup></span> at most thrice (3-tûmak) in a year [^30], that is, he does not wear a _sacred_ shirt and _thread_\-girdle, and his law also is this, that it is not necessary to wear _them_”’—and when the law of no belting is so grievous that, when that law shall be accepted, it is observed _that_ destruction is strengthened.

22\. The same belt, kept on after the command of Yim, _was_ the first token as regards which an annihilator of destruction is mentioned _and_ established by law; _and on_ both occasions [^31] destruction is more grievously manifest. 23. That which is more particularly important is such as the destroyer of destruction, Yim the splendid, advised, which the high-priest of the good, Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân, mentioned thus:--‘The _sacred thread_\-girdle is as a sign of the service of the sacred beings, a token of sin ended, and a presage of beneficence; _and one is_ to put _it_ on _and_ to gird _it_, in the neighbourhood of the heart and _on_ the middle of the body, with the religious formula accompanying the glorious scripture.’ 24. That is also betokened by _its_ equally-dividing (hambûr) position and determining fashion; for, as a wise man becomes a discriminator between benefit _and_ injury, between good and evil, so also the place of the _sacred thread_\-girdle is between below and above. 25. With a low _sacred_ girdle there is a passage for one‘s want of openness (avîshô<i>d</i>anŏ) and secret ruin, and also a shutting up [^32] of life; with a high _sacred_  <span id="p131"><sup><small>[ p. 131 ]</small></sup></span> girdle there is a way _for_ thought, word, and deed, and no confinement (agîri<i>s</i>nŏkârîh) of life; and tying the _sacred_ girdle with a religious rite (hamdînŏ) is like a glory amid the glories _of_ the angels, for it is itself through the aid of the patron spirit (ahvô). 26. And from the heart, which is the place of thought and dwelling of life, on the upper side (lâlâîh) are the eye, ear, tongue, _and_ brain, which are the dwellings of sight, hearing, speech, understanding, and intellect; and on its lower side (frô<i>d</i>îh) [^33] is the abode of a father’s generativeness.

27\. When this _sacred thread_\-girdle, whose token, sign, and presage are such [^34], is tied, it is girded on with this glorious rite [^35] of the glorious ones, the custom of the learned, the command of rulers, and the decree of apostles.

28\. That secretly-progressing destruction [^36], which _arises_ from the fiend of insubordination (asa<i>r</i>dârîh) [^37] who _was_ much afraid of Yim, _and_ which is averse to the labour of men _and_ the service of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is a demon and irreligious (dû<i>s</i>\-dînô), who is full of fear of the girdles (parvandîhâ) of the glory of <span id="p132"><sup><small>[ p. 132 ]</small></sup></span> religion, _with_ which both angels _and_ also worldlings _have_ become belted _and_ diligent.

29\. Then, because the glory for this belt of ours, which is called the Kûstîk and is worn on the middle of the body, remains unreleased (a<i>v</i>î-vûkht) from the angels, who are givers of glory, _and from_ men who are glorious—which is explained as a similitude _and_ sample of fortunes (bâharakŏîhâ) among worldlings, even those _who are_ actually primitive creatures likewise [^38]\—it _has_, therefore, seemed comely and desirable. 30. And their heart, will, knowledge, and purpose are as much for it as that which is perceptible where, even apart from those of the good religion who shall tie the _sacred thread_\-girdle with the scripture formula, _some_ of the faiths of all countries, except those who are unbelted, possess the religious custom [^39]. 31. Also outside the seat of the existence of faith [^40] all men have the waist, or the palms of the hands [^41], or similar joints for a girdle (kûstîkŏ); _and_ it is deemed comely, desirable, and convenient for work to wear _it_. 32. And _it_ is manifestly the lot (dakŏ) of the thoroughly-praising one whose own desire is truth and the enjoyment of welfare, _it is_ a token of the service of the sacred beings, and a sign of walking _in_ the commands of religion, <span id="p133"><sup><small>[ p. 133 ]</small></sup></span> which they shall tie on account of the superior beings (pâshûmân) with the proper formula, more particularly _with_ that which _one_ utters when _there is_ reliance _upon_ the scripture itself.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (122:1) The Kûstîk (Pers. kustî) consists of a string, about the size of a stay-lace, which is first passed twice round the waist very loosely, over the sacred shirt (see Chap. XL, 2), and tied in front with a loose double knot (right-handed and left-handed), and the long ends are then passed a third time round the waist and tied again behind with a similar double knot. This string contains six strands, each consisting of twelve very fine, white, woollen threads twisted together, or seventy-two threads in all. Near each end the six strands are braided together, instead of being twisted, and for the last inch they are braided into three separate string-ends of two strands each; these string-ends, therefore, contain twenty-four threads each, and form a kind of fringed end to the string. This fringe is a sort of remembrancer, as its six strands are supposed to symbolize the six Gâhanbârs or season-festivals, the twelve threads in each strand symbolize the twelve months, the twenty-four threads in each string-end symbolize the twenty-four kar<i>d</i>aks or sections of the Vispara<i>d</i>, and the seventy-two threads in the whole string symbolize the seventy-two his or chapters of the Yasna. The girdle has to be re-tied every time the hands have been washed, which, in order to comply with the ceremonial laws, occurs many times in the day; and each time it has to be done with ceremony and a particular formula of prayer (see § 27).

[^2]: (123:1) That is, fully clad, as going about uncovered is a sin (see Chap. XL, 4). On occasions of ceremony, and for the purpose of showing extraordinary respect, the Parsis wear an extra long-skirted robe.

[^3]: (123:2) Reading d<i>r</i>û<i>d</i>ŏê<i>d</i>, but the orthography is unusual and the word, therefore, uncertain.

[^4]: (124:1) The author is here adopting his most involved style of writing, which, in the original Pahlavi, is often hardly intelligible, and particularly apt to be misunderstood; but the object of this section seems to be to deprecate the Muhammadan practice of frequent prostrations during prayer, which are in marked contrast to the slight obeisances made by the Parsis.

[^5]: (124:2) Whether yêdatô means ‘an angel,’ or ‘God,’ is here uncertain.

[^6]: (124:3) The argument is that the growth of plants is so obviously occasioned by some unseen power that it naturally leads to meditation, and then to prayer.

[^7]: (124:4) The words dâni<i>s</i>nîkŏ levatman-tâ<i>s</i>tîk-shnâyîn seem to refer to the Bareshnûm ceremony of purification, described in Vend. IX, 1-145 (see App. IV), which is a rite eminently characteristic of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship.

[^8]: (125:1) Reading spenâk, but it may be sa<i>z</i>ŏâk, ‘seemly.’

[^9]: (126:1) See Chap. XXXVII, 47.

[^10]: (126:2) It is not certain that parvand signifies ‘a girdle,’ or that parvastanŏ means ‘to gird,’ but they seem to be used in that sense here. The former word translates Av. paurvanîm, ‘leading the Pleiades’ (Haug's Essays, p. 182), in Yas. IX, 81, an epithet applied to the belt of Orion.

[^11]: (126:3) M14 has ‘which.’

[^12]: (126:4) Quoted from Pahl. Yas. IX, 81 (see Chap. XXXVII, 48).

[^13]: (126:5) See Chap. XXXVII, 24-27.

[^14]: (127:1) M14 continues as follows:--‘through that girdle (parvand) of the religion, _and_ a _thread_\-girdle (kûstîkŏ), from the region of the world and religious _in character_, is put on within the middle third,’ &c.

[^15]: (127:2) Some words are evidently here missing in the Pahl. text, including the first word of the next section. The reason here given for the girdle being worn round the waist, just below the uppermost third of the body, is that the impregnable barrier of heaven (of which the girdle is a counterpart) is said to be just below the uppermost third of the sky.

[^16]: (127:3) See Chap. XXXVII, 80, 95.

[^17]: (127:4) Reading vispŏ khôî-<i>s</i>ôrân, but we might perhaps read vispŏân sahôrân, ‘all oppressors,’ assuming that sahôr stands for Av. sâthra, a term applied to some particular tribe of another religion which was under the rule of Yim and his two predecessors (see Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 26, 28, 31). Another possible reading is vispŏân yêkhvarân, ‘all frosts.’

[^18]: (127:5) Assuming that khvû<i>d</i>akŏ stands for khû<i>d</i>akŏ, but the word is uncertain.

[^19]: (127:6) The particular kind of fiendishness that led Yim astray in his old age (like Solomon) was lying, that is, denial of the truth of his religion. In consequence of this apostasy the royal glory departed from him, and he allied himself to the demons in the p. 128 617th year of his reign, and remained in their power for most of the remaining century of his life (see Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 31-38, Bd. XVIII, 1, XXXIV, 4).

[^20]: (128:1) Assuming that dastŏ stands for Pers. da<i>s</i>t, and varî<i>v</i>akŏ, for Pers. garîvah; otherwise, we may read ‘from dignity and the hovel (varî<i>k</i>akŏ),’ meaning that they perish from all ranks; instead of all places.

[^21]: (128:2) The rampart of heaven (see § 11).

[^22]: (128:3) His successors.

[^23]: (128:4) As detailed in § 18.

[^24]: (128:5) The Nîrang-i Kustî (see § 27).

[^25]: (129:1) The sacred shirt (see Chap. XL, 2). The garment of a purified man is called Vohûman in Vend. XIX, 76—78, 81—83 (trans. D.).

[^26]: (129:2) The term se<i>g</i> or sê<i>g</i>, used for ‘destruction’ here. and in §§ 21—23, is the name of ‘the fiend who causes annihilation’ (see Bd. XXVIII, 26).

[^27]: (129:3) It is possible that an-ayî<i>v</i>yâgânîh may mean ‘no garmenting,’ and refer to the sacred shirt, as the previous term a<i>v</i>îbandîh, ‘no belting,’ refers to the sacred thread-girdle.

[^28]: (129:4) In Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 21-23, with some variations (see Haug's Essays, p. 367).

[^29]: (129:5) Instead of rûbâkîh, ‘progress,’ K35 has rûbânîh, which might mean ‘soul-state,’ but is probably a clerical blunder.

[^30]: (130:1) In the Vendidad it is he who does not put one on for three years.

[^31]: (130:2) Both when ordered by Vim and when confirmed by Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

[^32]: (130:3) Reading a<i>v</i>ar-vadi<i>s</i>nŏih (the first nasal in bandi<i>s</i>n = vandi<i>s</i>n being often omitted); it can hardly be afrandi<i>s</i>nŏîh, ‘magnificence,’ because the latter abstract suffix, -îh, would be p. 131 ungrammatical after the former, -i<i>s</i>nŏ, in an uncompounded verbal noun. Some of the other words are also uncertain.

[^33]: (131:1) The MSS. have merely rô<i>d</i>ih.

[^34]: (131:2) As stated in § 23.

[^35]: (131:3) This is the Nîrang-i Kustî, or girdle formula, that has to be performed every time the girdle is re-tied, which happens several times a day. It is fully detailed in Appendix II, at the end of this volume.

[^36]: (131:4) See § 21; the first letter of nîhân, ‘secretly,’ is omitted by K35 in both places.

[^37]: (131:5) Sê<i>g</i>, the fiend of destruction, is connected with the demon Bût in Vend. XIX, 4, 6; but the characteristic of ‘insubordination’ is more applicable to the demon Tarômat, ‘the disobedient’ (see Bd. XXVIII, 14, 26, 34).

[^38]: (132:1) The precise meaning is not very clear.

[^39]: (132:2) Alluding probably to the Brahmanical thread which is worn by the higher castes of Hindus diagonally, over one shoulder and below the other arm, and is so far analogous to the Parsi thread-girdle that it is a religious symbol put on with a religious rite.

[^40]: (132:3) Reading varôyi<i>s</i>nŏ ahû gâs, but K35 has rôyi<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘growth,’ instead of ‘faith.’

[^41]: (132:4) Reading kafihâ, or kafagîh. Perhaps the allusion is to a rosary which is held in the hands, or worn on the wrists, by people of many religions.
