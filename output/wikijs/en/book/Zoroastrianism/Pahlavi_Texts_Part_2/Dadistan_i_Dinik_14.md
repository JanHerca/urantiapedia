## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XIV.

1\. The thirteenth question is that which you ask thus: 'Who should prepare the account of the soul as to sin and good works, and in what place should they make it up? _And_ when punishment is inflicted by them, where is their place then?

2\. The reply is this, that the account about the doers of actions, as to good works _and_ sin, three times every day whilst the doer of the actions is living, Vohûman the archangel should prepare; because taking account of the thoughts, words, and deeds of all material existences is among his duties. 3. And about the sin which _affects_ accusers [^1], which <span id="p33"><sup><small>[ p. 33 ]</small></sup></span> is committed by (va<i>l</i>) breakers of promises, even in the world Mit<i>r</i>ô [^1] is said _to be_ over the bodies, words, and fortunes (hû-bakhtakŏ) of the promise-breakers; _and_ as to the amount, and also as to _being_ more than the stipulation when _there is_ a period of time [^2], Mit<i>r</i>ô is the account-keeper. 4. In the three _nights' account_ (satûîh) Srôsh the righteous _and_ Rashnû the just [^3] are over the estimate of the limits of the good works _and_ sin of righteousness and wickedness. 5. In the future existence, on the completion of every account, the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> himself takes account [^4], by whom both the former account of the three _nights_ and all the thoughts, words, and deeds of the creatures are known through his omniscient wisdom.

6\. The punishment for a soul of the sinners comes from that spirit [^5] with _whom_ the sin, which was committed by it, is connected; fostered by the iniquity practised, that punishment comes upon the souls of the sinful and wicked, first on earth, afterwards in hell, _and_ lastly at the organisation of the <span id="p34"><sup><small>[ p. 34 ]</small></sup></span> future existence [1](sbe18023_htm.html). 7. When the punishment of the three _nights_ is undergone [2](sbe18023_htm.html) the soul of the righteous attains to heaven _and_ the best existence, _and_ the soul of the wicked to hell and the worst existence. 8. When they have undergone their punishment at the renovation _of the universe_ they attain, by complete purification from every sin, unto the everlasting progress, happy progress, _and_ perfect progress of the best _and_ undisturbed existence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (32:1) Sins are divided into two classes, hamêmâlân or those which affect ‘accusers,’ and rûbânîk or those which affect only one‘s own soul. In the first class are included all evil actions which injure our fellow-creatures or any good animal or thing, and for which the injured party (the ’accuser') must receive satisfaction before the sinner can be pardoned (see Sls. VIII, I).

[^1]: (33:1) The angel of the sun's light; he is a personification of friendship and good faith, and is, therefore, specially aggrieved by breaches of promise and fraudulent debtors, but assists righteous souls in their passage to the other world (see AV. V, 3, Mkh. II, 118).

[^2]: (33:2) Referring to debts and promises to pay.

[^3]: (33:3) The angels of obedience and justice; the duty of the former is to protect the righteous, and that of the latter is to weigh the good works and sins in his golden scales, when the soul's account is balanced after the third night after death (see AV. V, 2-5, Mkh. II, 115-122).

[^4]: (33:4) Referring, perhaps, to the future temporary separation of the wicked from the righteous, after the assembly of the Sa<i>d</i>vâstarân (see Bd. XXX, 10-16).

[^5]: (33:5) The demon who is supposed to have occasioned the sin.
