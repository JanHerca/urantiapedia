P. [66](sbe18038_htm.html), line 15; [p. 67](sbe18038_htm.html), l. 7; for ‘Mitrô,’ read ‘Mit<i>r</i>ô.’

P. [198](sbe18071_htm.html), lines 1, 3, for ‘the Supreme Being’ and ‘the Being’ read ‘God (yêdatô),’ and cancel note 1.

P. [109](sbe18044_htm.html), note 2, add ‘Malkôs has also been read Markûs and traced to Av. mahrkû<i>s</i>ô (see Fragment VIII, 2 in Westergaard’s Zend-Avesta, p. 334), which appears to be the title of some demon, regarding whom very little can be ascertained from the text that mentions him.'

P. [143](sbe18050_htm.html), l. 12; [145](sbe18050_htm.html), l. 6; [150](sbe18051_htm.html), note 6; [252](sbe18095_htm.html), l. 6; [289](sbe18104_htm.html), note 2; [318](sbe18111_htm.html), ll. 26, 27; [346](sbe18117_htm.html), l. 24; for ‘Âtûr’ and ‘Âtûrŏ’ read ‘Âtû<i>r</i>’ and ‘Âtû<i>r</i>ŏ.’

The following emendations depend upon the meaning to be attached to the word vâspôharak, or vâspûharak, which in Mkh. I, 7 was traced to Pers. bâ, ‘with,’ and sipihrah, ‘sphere, world, universe,’ and supposed to mean ‘world-renowned,’ being rendered by vikhyâtimat in Sanskrit. The objections to this etymology are that Pers. bâ is Pahl. a<i>v</i>âk (not vâ), which is nearly always replaced by Huz. levatman, and that vâspûhar appears to be the correct form of the word vaspûr, which explains the Huz. barbêtâ, literally ‘son of the house’ in the Pahlavi Farhang (p. 9, ed. H.); the latter word having been the highest title of the Persian nobility, probably confined to the heads of seven families (see Nŏldeke‘s Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, pp. 71, 501). Such nobles are called barbêtân in the Hâ<i>g</i>îâbâd inscription, line 6, and vâspûharakan in the Naq<i>s</i>\-i Rustam inscription, line 6; they may perhaps be styled ’princes,‘ and their title, vâspûhar, may be traced to the ancient Persian equivalent of Av. vîsô puthra (Vend. VII, 114), literally ’son of the village or borough.‘ It may be noted, however, that the word ’sphere‘ does really occur in a form very similar to this title, in the word aspiharakânîkîhâ, ’as regards the spheres,' in Dd. 88, 4.

P. [78](sbe18043_htm.html), ll. 11-13, read ‘But those who are the more princely (vâspûharakânîktar) producers of the renovation are said to be seven . . .’

P. [91](sbe18044_htm.html), ll. 11, 12, read ‘. . . and he made the princes (vâspûharakânîhâ) contented.’

<span id="p480"><sup><small>[ p. 480 ]</small></sup></span>

P. [172](sbe18055_htm.html), ll. 26, 27, read ‘. . . a minder of the princes of the religion (dînvâspûharakânŏ), the angels, and _with_ pure thoughts . . .’

P. [262](sbe18098_htm.html), ll. 15, 16, read ‘. . . and its position is most princely (vâspûharakânîktar).’

P. [282](sbe18103_htm.html), ll. 17, 18, read ‘On account of the princeliness (vâspûharakânîh) of the good _people_ of Khvanîras . . .’

P. [289](sbe18104_htm.html), ll. 14, 15, read ‘. . . I _am_ more applauding the princes (vâspûharakânŏ-zâhtar) about the property of the profession . . .’

P. [306](sbe18108_htm.html), ll. 23, 24, read ‘. . . to keep in use the equal measure _which is_ more _the custom_ of his own superiors (naf<i>s</i>man vâspûharakântar).’
