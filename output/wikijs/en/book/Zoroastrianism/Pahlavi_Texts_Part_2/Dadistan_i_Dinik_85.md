## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXXV.

1\. _As to_ the eighty-fourth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: _As to_ a gift for the ceremonial _which_ they do not reduce, and while they give _it_ in excess, in what manner is then its great advantage, _and_ how _and_ in how many modes is it possible to occur?

2\. The reply is this, that the advancement of the ceremonial of the sacred beings is by so much as the gift is more fully given; and the great advantage of the good work is more, and its reasons many, therefrom. 3. The desire of this wealth, which _has_ come for the sake of the good work, is an experience <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> of the comfortable living of the angels, by whom the solemnizers are aggrandized, and is proper apart from _its_ great judiciousness; to diminish _it_ is improper.

4\. When the gift _for_ the ceremonial is abundantly given, the performers of the ceremonial, who, with much trouble annoying them, _have_ solemnized the Avesta _and_ chanted the hymns (Gâthas), and obtain the stipend of their solemnizing from the remuneration _of_ the solemnization, are living comfortably, thriving, and blessed. 5. And also the undertakers of all the religious rites who, by means of the hope of rightful religion, render _one_ certain as to the way _to_ the distant awful place [^1], and tempt the longers for righteousness into the religion [^2], undertake all the religious rites _and_ ceremonial _of_ the sacred beings for the sake of the stipend of proper diligence.

6\. And reasoning thought is cognizant as regards the advantageousness due to the undertakers and solemnizers of all the religious rites, and a great stipend is more obtained and observed _for them_ than for _any_ other profession. 7. The sons, too, of priests and disciples strive for the words prayed [^3], and are more eager for their. prayers; and many, likewise, shall engage for all the religious rites, and become more diffusive of the religion (dînô bâli<i>s</i>nîktar); and, in like, manner, the proper, more attainable, _and_ more propitious path of the good for saving the soul becomes wider [^4].
