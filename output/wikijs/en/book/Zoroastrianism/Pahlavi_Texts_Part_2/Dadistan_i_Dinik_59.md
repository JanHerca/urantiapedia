## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LIX.

1\. _As to_ the fifty-eighth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: For how much property is it then necessary to appoint an adopted son?

2\. The reply is this, that when the property which _has_ remained his for whom it is necessary to appoint an adopted son is as much as sixty stîrs [^1] of income, _it_ is then indispensable to appoint an adopted son for him. 3. Even when _it_ is less they should recognise him whose adoption is needful, _and who_ conducts an adopted son's duty; and, similarly, an adoption is to be appointed for him, though it may not come as a possession unto him who is fittest for adoption.
