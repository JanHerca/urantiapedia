## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. CHAPTER IX.

1\. And _as to_ that which is written [^1], that ‘_the teachings of_ Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, Afarg, and Sôshâns [^2] have all three come _and_ remained, and, on that account, whoever _has_ washed just as they always wash therein is certain that he is worthy.’ 2. Also, ‘should it have been as _it were_ proper to them, would Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh have said that “not even the purifier is single?”’ 3. _And_ the rest as written an that subject, which, on account of its acute observation, _has_ seemed _to be_ from their statements; they, however, _have_ not decided it so by the teaching which is in their names, as _was_ indicated by me before [^3].

4\. But I do not so understand that ‘if those should have been all the particulars of the peculiarity of all three teachings, would _the teachings_ of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh and Sôshâns have said, concerning any one who should have so washed that the purifier was single, that it is suitable, because the high-priests have been thus very unanimous that when <span id="p313"><sup><small>[ p. 313 ]</small></sup></span> there is one he is unsuitable [^4]? 5. And when it should be to them as _it were_ proper that, apart from the hands, the other [^5] customary _parts_ (pî<i>s</i>akŏ) _should be_ washed once by them, would Afarg have said it is proper [^6], because washing them three times is not mentioned in the Avesta? 6. And when it would have been as _it were_ proper that the three hundred pebbles (sang) _should_ not _be_ cast _into_ the water and bull’s urine, _would_ Afarg‘s _teaching have_ said that it is proper [^7], because there is not a single use for a pebble (sagî<i>k</i>akŏ)? 7. And when it would be as _it were_ proper that _he who_ is washed at the ablution seats (mak) at which any one _has been_ washed _during_ the length of a year, is not injured thereby—only they shall take them away _and they_ are again deposited [^8]\—would Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh’s _teaching_ have said that it is proper, because, when the stones (sagŏ) are again deposited by one, _it_ is to effect the cleansing (vistari<i>s</i>nŏ) of some one, <span id="p314"><sup><small>[ p. 314 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ when a _shower of_ rain occurs thereon so _that_ the whole place shall be thoroughly wetted, inside _and_ outside, it is proper? 8. And if some one says that this is the case of a rite by a teaching of authority, and the rule is by a teaching of private authority, is not the whole rite by any teaching proper, that _consists_ in this washing which is thoroughly preserved as they keep _it_ in practice [^9]?'

9\. The reply is even this, that every rite (nîrông) is to be performed _in_ such manner as _that_ which is said _to be_ most preservative, and most connected with the declaration of revelation _and_ the testimony of the high-priests _concerning_ it. 10. And not for the reason that Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh‘s _teaching_ is more preservative [^10] as to one rite, and after that some-thing of Afarg is more preservative, is the operation to be performed by the statement of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh; _but_ whatever is the more preservative of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh’s is collected from Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, all the more preservative of Afarg from Afarg, _and_ that which is the more preservative of _any_ other high-priest from that which _has_ the most preservative approval of the high-priest. 11. That which those high-priests _have_ said, which they decide by just authority, is the commandment of the learned of the realm, which has lawfully arisen over the provinces (shôhârânŏ); but even that statement opposing it _which_ is much testified _and_ manifestly more of a deliverance, or which is declared _as_ an exposition <span id="p315"><sup><small>[ p. 315 ]</small></sup></span> of the teaching of high-priests of the religion in a dissimilar case, they shall then [^11] wholly accept, and _they_ are to perform the operation authorisedly _and_ preservatively thereby.

12\. This, too, I so consider, _that_ even if each separate teaching should be as _it were_ proper, it would then not be determined by them as to the impropriety of the _purifying_ cup, for Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh _has_ stated, only as _it was_ apparent to him, that every single customary _part_ is to be washed for three times [^12], _and has_ not specifically determined that when all shall be _so_ once it is not proper. 13. By the special teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh and the washing which is in the law that says—concerning those interpreting revelation—that whoever becomes quite polluted shall thoroughly wash by that law, so that his _being_ washed is to be considered as _being_ washed, it (the rite) is not performed by me if, also, that other high-priest _has_ said, that every one who becomes quite polluted, _and_ washes not by the law of the primitive faith, is not to be considered as washed. 14. Then, too, in the special teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh _it_ is not said, _of_ that washing which is washed by the law of those of a portion of the religion (pârak-dînôân), that it is note proper.

15\. He who washes by the law of those of the primitive faith, which many high-priests maintain as excellent, because it is suitable, _and_ imagines that regarding the threefold washing it should be said that it is not proper, even he—when he also <span id="p316"><sup><small>[ p. 316 ]</small></sup></span> _has_ become of the same opinion as to this, that the statements of the high-priests are on an equality, and the most evidence of the high-priests is the _right_ course—would have attained to confidence about this, that in a doubtful matter _there_ should be a high-priest [^13], and also that _of_ which Afarg and Sôshâns _have_ alike understood a similar thing is proper.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (312:1) In the epistle to which he is replying.

[^2]: (312:2) See Chap. V, 1.

[^3]: (312:3) See Chap. VI, 2-4.

[^4]: (313:1) The writer says he does not understand this argument of his correspondents, because it differs from the view he takes in Chap. VI, 2, but it must be confessed that the meaning of the passage in dispute (Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, b) is not very clear, as the word ashâye<i>d</i>, ‘he is unsuitable,’ can also. be read ae shâye<i>d</i>, ‘he would be suitable,’ both there and in our text.

[^5]: (313:2) K35 has one line blank here, but this was probably owing to the state of the paper, or some inadvertence of the copyist; as it is evident that none of the text is omitted.

[^6]: (313:3) Compare Chap. VI, 9-I1.

[^7]: (313:4) Compare Chap. VII, 16-18.

[^8]: (313:5) This shows that the places for ablution during the Bareshnûm ceremony were, a thousand years ago, the same as now, namely, stones deposited on the ground, not holes dug in the ground, as directed in Vend. IX, 13, 14, 16. They are, in fact, the stones or hard material directed to be deposited at the holes in Vend. IX, 29, 30, but they go by the old name for the holes (magh).

[^9]: (314:1) This string of arguments appears to be quoted from the epistle to which the writer is replying, but as they are separated from their context it is difficult to understand the exact line of argument. or to be sure that they are translated correctly.

[^10]: (314:2) From pollution or sin.

[^11]: (315:1) That is, when the dissimilar case arises, or when it is manifestly more efficient.

[^12]: (315:2) See Chap. VI, 7.

[^13]: (316:1) To consult about the matters in doubt.
