## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XVI.

1\. The fifteenth question is that which you ask thus: When the dogs and birds tear it (the corpse) does the soul know _it_, and does it occur uncomfortably _for_ it, or how is it?

2\. The reply is this, that the pain _occasioned_ by the tearing and gnawing so galls (mâlê<i>d</i>ŏ) the body of men that, though the soul _were_ abiding with the body, such soul; which _one_ knows is happy and immortal, _would_ then depart from the body, _along_ with the animating life, the informing (sinâyinâkŏ) consciousness, _and_ the remaining resources of life. 3. The body is inert, unmoving, and not to be galled; and at last no pain whatever galls _it_, nor is it perceived; and the soul, with the life, is outside of the body, and is not unsafe as regards its gnawing, but through the spiritual perception [^1] it sees _and_ knows _it_.

4\. That which is wicked is then again desirous of its bodily existence [^2], when it sees them thus; the wonderfully-constructed body which was its <span id="p37"><sup><small>[ p. 37 ]</small></sup></span> vesture, _and_ is dispersed, and that spiritual life (hûkŏ) which was with its heart, and is even on account of this—that is: ‘Because in my bodily existence and worldly progress _there was_ no atonement for sin and no accumulation of righteousness’—also in mourning about it thus: ‘In the prosperity which this body of mine had, it would have been possible for me to atone for sin _and_ to save the soul, _but_ now I am separated from every one and _from_ the joy of the world, which is great hope of spiritual _life_; and I have attained to the perplexing account and more serious danger.’ 5. And the gnawing becomes as grievous to it, on account of that body, as a closely-shut arsenal (afzâr bêtâ-î badtûm) and a concealed innermost garment are useless among those with limbs _provided_ with weapons and accoutrements, and are destroyed.

6\. And of that, too, which is righteous and _filled_ with the great joy that _arises_ from _being_ really certain of the best existence, then also the spiritual life which was with its body, on account of the great righteousness, _fit_ for the exalted (fîrâkhtagânîk), which _was_ ever accumulated by it with the body, is well developed (madam hû-tâshî<i>d</i>ŏ), _and_ the wonderfully-constructed body is destroyed in the manner of a garment, particularly when its dispersion (apâsi<i>s</i>nŏ) occurs thereby.

7\. And the consciousness of men, as it sits three nights outside of the body, in the vicinity of the body, _has_ to remember and expect that _which_ is truly fear and trouble (khâr) unto the demons, _and_ reward, peace, and glad tidings (nôvîk) unto the spirits of the good; and, on account of the dispersion and injuring of the body, it utters a cry spiritually, <span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span> thus: ‘Why do the dogs and birds gnaw this organised body, when still at last the body and life unite together at the raising of the dead?’ 8. And this is the reminding of the resurrection _and_ liberation, and it becomes the happiness and hope of the spirit of the body _and_ the other good spirits, and the fear _and_ vexation of the demons and fiends.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (36:1) Supposing that sinâ<i>s</i>nŏ stands for <i>s</i>inâyi<i>s</i>nŏ; otherwise we must read ‘in the spiritual places (dîvâgânŏ).’

[^2]: (36:2) This section is made still more complicated in the Pahlavi text by the division of this first phrase; half of it being placed at the beginning, and the other half at the extreme end of the sentence.
