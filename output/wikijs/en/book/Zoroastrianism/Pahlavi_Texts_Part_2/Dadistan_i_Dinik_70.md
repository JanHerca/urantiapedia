## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXX.

1\. _As to_ the sixty-ninth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: What are these river-beds [^3], and what is the cause of them; whence do they always arise, _and_ why is _there_ not a river-bed every-where _and in_ every place where _there_ is no mountain?

2\. The reply is this, that any place where a mountain is not discernible and a river-bed exists _it_ is a fissure (a<i>s</i>kûpŏ); and it is declared as clear that, even before the growth of the mountains, when the earth was all a plain, _by_ the shaking of the world the whole world became rent (zandakŏ) [^4]. 3. Even <span id="p214"><sup><small>[ p. 214 ]</small></sup></span> Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> of Tûr [^1] _was_ specially mighty by causing the construction of channels (vi<i>d</i>arg) there where _it_ is mountainous, _and_ also _in_ low-lands [^2], in which there is no mountain, and the shaking in its creation _was_ the formation of great sunken [^3] springs and river-beds. 4. And if it has been prepared _in, or_ if _it be_ in a ravine (<i>s</i>ikaftŏ) of, the mountains, the cause, too, of the contraction, thundering, and tearing of a river, if _its_ confinement _be_ in the earth, is the resistance which it _meets_ in seeking a passage; and as it is a spring of the waters of the earth, so also it is in the earth, whose contraction _and_ panting are mighty _and_ full of strength. 5. And when _it is_ a time that they would make a constructed channel at the outside of its ravine, as regards the contraction which is within it, the resistance by which it is contracted at the outside of the ravine is the ground  [^4].

## Footnotes

[^3]: (213:3) There is some doubt as to whether the word should be read zôgakŏ (comp. Pers. zô_gh_, ‘a river’), or zandakŏ (comp. Pers. <i>z</i>andah, ‘fissured’), but the meaning is tolerably certain from the context.

[^4]: (213:4) When the evil spirit rushed into the earth it is said to have shaken, and the mountains began to grow (see Bd. VIII, 1-5); and at the resurrection it is expected that the earth will recover its original perfect state of a level plain (see Bd. XXX, 33).

[^1]: (214:1) Frangrasyan, the Tûryan, in the Avesta; called Afrâsiyâb in the Shâhnâmah (see Bd. XXXI, x4). He is often mentioned as constructing canals (see Bd. XX, 17, 34, XXI, 6), but being a foreign conqueror he was considered as specially wicked by the Irânians.

[^2]: (214:2) Assuming that <i>s</i>îtân is a miswriting of <i>s</i>îpŏân, occasioned by joining two of the letters, just as harvispŏ, ‘all,’ is often written harvist.

[^3]: (214:3) Or, perhaps, ‘hidden.’

[^4]: (214:4) That is, a watercourse which is confined by its natural rocky channel in the mountains, when carried across the plain in a canal, is confined only, by softer soil.
