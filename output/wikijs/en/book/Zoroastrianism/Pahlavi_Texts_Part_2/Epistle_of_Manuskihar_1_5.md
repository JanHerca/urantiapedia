## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. CHAPTER V.

1\. That writing which comes amid the writing of your epistle is a correct fragment [^1] as regards the nothing in which _one_ is to change the operation properly maintainable, and it is becoming; because, if it be even for him, by whom it is written from the <span id="p299"><sup><small>[ p. 299 ]</small></sup></span> statements of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, Afarg, and Sôshâns [^1], the several statements _and_ teachings of the same high-priests, yet then the elaboration _and_ publication thereof are not such as that which is sent down by his further elaboration [^2]. 2. And thereby it _has_ seemed manifest _that it_ is sent so that a wish for the spirit _may_ proceed from the truth of _its_ minister (pa<i>d</i>ŏ), or _from_ his thought for the desired decision; or his understanding _may_ be of that kind which is warped (vukô<i>s</i>tŏ), as though he believed it as other than the exposition of the religion _and_ the teaching of the high-priests. 3. But until the unparalleled arrival of Sôshâns [^3] any one not sharing in complete knowledge is not appointed unto a patron spirit (ahvŏ), _and_ the fiend specially contends more experimentally with the thoughts of the high-priests of the religion for a religious decision.

4\. And even the recompense of community [^4] of property is that when _one_ gladly observes pure thoughts; _and_ the swift action of voluble (pûr) speakers and kind regard of religious characters for deliverance [^5] _and_ for the noticeable undeceitfulness of the same spirit [^6]\--which is itself the desire of settled observation that is in it for the sake of the <span id="p300"><sup><small>[ p. 300 ]</small></sup></span> same kind of full religious diffusion--are the swift action of the patron spirit, which, for the sake of preparing him for a deliverance that is not falsifying revelation _and is_ without disputants, is a kind regard for the deliverance itself of _him_ whose spiritual life (hûkŏ) it is.

5\. _As to_ that which is thought by him [^1] of those deliverances sent down, completed, _and_ announced, I consider more particularly about the meaning of one thing, which is their solemnized observance. 6. The solemnized observance of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is in the teaching [^2] of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, and those of Afarg and Sôshâns are each one meditated _and_ indicated in a teaching; and the pointedly superior position of each one of them is mentioned by him in _his_ statement of any teaching and _of_ the decision set up. 7. Also with a kind regard for his own choice he _has_ thought it (the former teaching) imperfect, and, on account of _what_ was not attained by it--which _was_ a re-explainer of the same good ideas provided--_its_ dissimilarity to it is not unnoticed [^3]. 8. _But_ when _one_ hears the re-explainers of a true reply he is well protected (hû-zinharî<i>d</i>ŏ) by complete mindfulness [^4], _and_ is himself confident that the teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is not the whole statement of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, for there are many opinions of <span id="p301"><sup><small>[ p. 301 ]</small></sup></span> Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh [^1] _which_ have decided _in_ another manner; not _that_ whatever Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh said is not good, _but_ in the teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh _it_ is certain that even _what_ is not proper is mentioned many _times_ as a possibility [^2].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (298:1) Reading ban<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nîh, but it may be bû<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nîh, ‘deliverance from contamination.’ The reference is to the decree of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam mentioned in Chap. IV, 7, the ‘writing’ alluded to in Ep. II, ii, 1; iii, 1.

[^1]: (299:1) The names of three of the commentators whose opinions are most frequently quoted in the Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i> (see Sls. I, 3). Each of them appears to have written a complete ‘teaching’ or dissertation upon the ceremonial laws, from which the quotations are taken (see § 6).

[^2]: (299:2) That is, in collecting the opinions of the ancients, he has twisted them so as to suit his own views.

[^3]: (299:3) The last of the future apostles (see Dd. II, 10), not the commentator of the same name mentioned in § 1.

[^4]: (299:4) Literally ‘fraternity.’

[^5]: (299:5) From pollution or sin.

[^6]: (299:6) See § 2.

[^1]: (300:1) Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam the writer of the decree mentioned in § 1.

[^2]: (300:2) The word <i>k</i>â<i>s</i>takŏ means usually a written course of teaching or exposition, a commentary, dissertation, or manual of instruction.

[^3]: (300:3) Implying that Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam had been more inclined to enforce his own opinions than to examine those of the commentators.

[^4]: (300:4) The Pahl. translation of Av. ârmaiti, ‘devotion,’ which is usually personified as a female archangel protecting the earth.

[^1]: (301:1) J inserts ‘rules which are mentioned in the special teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh.’ It appears probable that the author had access to much more complete commentaries than the fragments now extant in the Pahlavi version of the Vendidâ<i>d</i>.

[^2]: (301:2) Meaning, probably, that Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh was disposed to relax the rigid enforcement of the law in cases of doubt or difficulty, as the Avesta itself does in several cases.
