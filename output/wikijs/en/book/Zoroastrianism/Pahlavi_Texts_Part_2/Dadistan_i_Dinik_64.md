## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXIV.

1\. _As to_ the sixty-third question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: Whence _was_ the first creation of mankind, and how was the formation of the original race of men? 2. What issued from Gâyômar<i>d</i> [^1], _and_ what did it really become; and from what have Mashyâîh _and_ Mashyâyôîh [^2] arisen?

3\. The reply is this, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the all <span id="p198"><sup><small>[ p. 198 ]</small></sup></span> ruling, produced from the endless light the shape of a fire-priest (âsrûkŏ) whose name _was_ that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and _its_ brilliance that of fire; _its_ incombustibility was like _that_ inside the light, _and its_ expansion like the western (khûrbarag) land. 4. And in the shape of the fire-priest _was_ created by him the material existence (stih) _that_ is called man, _and for_ three thousand years [^3], when it did not progress and did not eat, it did not speak; likewise, it did not utter, but it thought of, the righteousness of the perfect _and_ true religion, the desire for the pure glorification of the creator.

5\. Afterwards, the contentious promise-breaker [^4] injured the life of it, _and_ produced a burdensome mortality; and the mortality is _clear_ from the appellation, Gâyômar<i>d</i> [^5], of the nature produced. 6. The seed which _was_ the essence of the life of the leader (mîrakŏ) of life, who _was_ Gâyômar<i>d</i>, flowed forth on _his_ passing away, came on to the earth of the beneficent angel [^6], _and_ is preserved in the earth until, through the protection of the angels, a brother and <span id="p199"><sup><small>[ p. 199 ]</small></sup></span> sister of mankind [^7], connected together, have grown from it, _have_ attained to movement _and_ walking upon the earth, _and_ have advanced even to intercourse and also procreation.

7\. The ground where the life of Gâyômar<i>d</i> departed is gold, _and_ from the other land, where the dissolution of _his_ various members occurred, as many kinds of decorative metals flowed forth it is said [^8].

[^3]: (198:1) This is the second of the four periods of three thousand years of which time is said to be composed (see Chap. XXXVII, 11 n). The ‘shape of the fire-priest’ is one of the spiritual creations of the first period, in which shape man was created during the second period, and this primeval man became Gâyômar<i>d</i> (that is, ‘a living mortal’) through the persecution of the evil spirit (see § 5) at the commencement of the third period. The first two steps of this creation are not described to the text of the Bundahi<i>s</i> known to Europeans.

[^4]: (198:2) The evil spirit, who is said to be the origin of falsehood (see Chap. XXXVII, 17).

[^5]: (198:3) Which means ‘the living mortal,’ or ‘the mortal living one.’

[^6]: (198:4) The female archangel Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, who has special charge of the earth. Or the phrase may be ‘came on to the earth which the beneficent spirit produced.’

[^7]: (199:1) The Mashyâîh and Mashyâyôîh, or man and woman, of § 2, who are said to have grown up, in the course of forty years, connected together in the shape of a plant; but, after a breathing soul had entered them, they became human beings, and fifty. years later they began to be the progenitors of mankind (see Bd. XV, 1-30).

[^8]: (199:2) Zs. X, 2 states that eight kinds of metal arose from the various members of the dead Gâyômar<i>d</i>, namely, gold, silver, iron, brass, tin, lead, quicksilver, and adamant.
