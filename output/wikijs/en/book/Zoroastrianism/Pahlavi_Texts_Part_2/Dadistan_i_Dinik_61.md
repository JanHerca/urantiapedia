## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXI.

1\. _As to_ the sixtieth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: What is the propriety _and_ impropriety, the merit _and_ demerit, of family guardianship?

2\. The reply is this, that the merit is the appointment _and_ recognition of him who accomplishes more worthily the greater benefit; the demerit is _as to_  <span id="p194"><sup><small>[ p. 194 ]</small></sup></span> him who is unworthy, or him whose worthiness is not appointed to avert a lesser benefit and the ruining of a worthy adoption. 3. Nearer details (khûr<i>d</i>akŏ) of the family guardianship which is proper _and_ which is not proper for an adopted son's duty, of the child of good religion with whose business _it_ is connected, _and_ of the fathers for whom a family guardian is to be appointed, are _in_ the recital of five chapters (fragar<i>d</i>ŏ) of the Hûspârûm _Nask_ [^1], and _in_ the abstracts (giriftakŏîhâ) of the good ideas in various scriptures (naskô) in which many decisions are together.
