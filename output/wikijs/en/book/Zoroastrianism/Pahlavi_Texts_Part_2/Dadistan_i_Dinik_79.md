## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXIX.

1\. _As to_ the seventy-eighth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: What is the decision _about_ water _with_ the _word_ Ithâ [^1] and _him who_ shall drink it? 2. When a man _has_ performed his ritual _and_ does not take the prayer (vâ<i>g</i>ŏ) _inwardly, but_ drinks water with the _word_ Ithâ, what is the decision _about_ this efficacy [^2] of which he takes up one half _and_ abandons one half, how is it necessary, or not, to consider _it_, and what is the sin of it? 3. _As to him_ who performs half, _or_ less than half, of the efficacy, _and_ drinks water with the _word_ Ithâ, what is the retribution for this sin when he shall commit _it_ occasionally, _and_ what is good _in order_ that this sin, when he shall commit _it_, may depart from _its_ source? <span id="p234"><sup><small>[ p. 234 ]</small></sup></span> 4\. _As to him_ who _has_ performed his Nâbar [^1] ritual, _and_ drinks water with the _word_ Ithâ, not muttering (andâkŏ) the _inward_ prayer (vâ<i>g</i>ŏ), and performs a ceremony (ya<i>s</i>tô), though he does not order a ceremony of Gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> [^2] for himself, is the decision then _about_ him anything better, or not; _and_ does the good work of this ceremony of Gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> become just the same as _that_ of the Nâbar ceremony, or not? 5. _As to him_ who orders a ceremony of Gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> for [^3] himself, what is then his good work, and what is the value [^4] of his worthiness when he does not himself perform because he orders that they should perform for him? 6. And _as to_ him who has not performed his ceremony, _and_ is fifteen years _old_, what is then the decision _about_ him?

7\. The reply is this:--When a man _who has_ chanted the Gâthas (‘hymns’) [^5] drinks water with the _word_ Ithâ, if, moreover, _being_ preservable _from_ suffering [^6], he be not a righteous _one_ overwhelmed by impotence, it is thus said that, when _in order_ to consecrate the sacred cake (drônô) [^7] it is not possible <span id="p235"><sup><small>[ p. 235 ]</small></sup></span> to take the prayer _inwardly_, and _there_ are no presentations of it for the tasting of the virtuous _with inward_ prayer [^1] or for the sake of relieving the sickness of a righteous person, which has come severely, when it is possible for him _to say_ ‘Ithâ’ _and_ one ‘Ashem-vohû [^2],’ or it is possible for him to say ‘Ashem,’ _he_ is to recite that which it is possible for him to speak, and _he_ is to drink or eat [^3] the water, or food, or medicine which is discreetly his, and may be the custom of his body and life [^4].

8\. But the sinfulness of _him_ who _has_ drunk water with the _word_ Ithâ, not owing to suffering, is much the most sinful, except this efficacy of which _you have_ written that, _having_ taken up [^5] one half, they shall abandon one half; for, when in eating the efficacy is possessed in that manner, _it_ is then a chattering meal which is a very grievous sin [^6]. 9. Every single drop (pashan) [^7] which in that manner comes to the <span id="p236"><sup><small>[ p. 236 ]</small></sup></span> mouth _as_ a new taste is _a sin of_ three stîrs [^1], and every single _thing_ which is spoken like that word [^2] is a sin of three stîrs, which is mentioned as the minimum.

10\. The retribution is that way well perfected when, in renunciation of that sin which attacks, a proper efficacy is prepared _and_ becomes a vestige (vûnakŏ) of the sin of the performer. 11. Whoever is not able to arrange it in this manner is to entreat the prayers of three men with a donation of wealth, and is to solemnize his Nônâbar _ceremony_ [^3], _or he_ is to consecrate a sacred cake every day in the ceremonial place, to eat food lawfully, _and_ to order the proper maintenance of the efficacy. 12. The assistance of performing the proper rituals through ordering the Nâbar _ceremony_, and the helping existence of discharging the burden of the trouble of a populous household seem to me suitable for the atonement of such-like sin, through the will of the sacred beings.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (233:1) The first word of Yas. V, 1, 2 which forms the first portion (after the invocation) of the inward prayer, or grace, to be muttered before eating or drinking. This first portion may be translated as follows: ‘Here then we praise Ahura-mazda, who gave (or created) both cattle and righteousness, he gave both water and good plants, he gave both the luminaries and the earth, and everything good.’ This is followed by three Ashem-vohûs, each meaning as follows: ‘Righteousness is the best good, a blessing it is; a blessing be to that which is righteousness to _the angel of_ perfect rectitude.’ After muttering these formulas, or ‘taking’ them inwardly as a protective spell, the mutterer can eat or drink, and after washing his mouth he ‘speaks out’ the spell or vâ<i>g</i> by reciting certain other formulas aloud. This chapter refers to those who mutilate the vâ<i>g</i> by muttering only its first word or words, which matter is also treated in Sls. V.

[^2]: (233:2) Supposing that this word, which may be twice read mâânâê and four times mâânâê, represents the Ar. ma’hni, but this is by no means certain.

[^1]: (234:1) The initiatory ceremony of a young priest, written nâîbar or nâgbar in this chapter, and sometimes nônâbar (Pahl. navak nâîbar).

[^2]: (234:2) This ceremony, which means ‘the world-purchased,’ and by which, according to the Sad-dar Bundahi<i>s</i>, ‘heaven is purchased in the world, and one’s own place brought to hand in heaven,‘ lasts three days, and is performed by two priests; the first day’s ceremonies are those of the Nônâbar, those of the second are of the angel Srôsh, and those of the third are of the Sîrôzah, or angels of the thirty days of the month (see Bd. XXX, 28 n).

[^3]: (234:3) Reading râî instead of lâ, ‘not’

[^4]: (234:4) Reading va<i>r</i>kâ, instead of va neked, ‘female,’ which is much like it in Pahl. letters.

[^5]: (234:5) And is, therefore, an initiated. priest.

[^6]: (234:6) M14 has ‘from impotent suffering.’

[^7]: (234:7) See Chap. XXX, I.

[^1]: (235:1) Reading vâ<i>g</i>ŏ atôfdâ<i>d</i>agân-î nadûgânŏ, which M14 has altered to mean ‘and if in his state of hunger and thirst.’

[^2]: (235:2) Merely the first words of the two formulas which constitute the inward prayer, or vâ<i>g</i> (see § i n).

[^3]: (235:3) M14 has only ‘_he_ is to eat.’

[^4]: (235:4) M14 has ‘and is authorisedly to preserve his own body.’

[^5]: (235:5) Reading f<i>r</i>âg, as in M14 and § 2, instead of pavan, ‘in;’ though the reading ‘in taking up’ is quite possible.

[^6]: (235:6) The sin of drâyân-<i>g</i>ûyi<i>s</i>nîh, ‘eagerness for chattering,’ which arises from talking while eating, praying, or at any other time when a prayer (vâ<i>g</i>) has been taken inwardly and is not yet spoken out. The sin arises from breaking the spell of the inward prayer (see Sts. V).

[^7]: (235:7) Comp. Av. parshuya and Pers. pashang, bashang. This word has been misread ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n, ‘ceremony,’ in Sls. V, 3, 4, which ought to stand as follows:--‘It is unseasonable chatter for every single drop; _for_ him who has performed the ritual _it_ is a Tanâpûhar sin; _for_ him who has not performed the ritual _it_ is less, p. 136 some _have_ said three Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâms. The measure of unseasonable chatter is a Tanâpûhar _sin_; this is where every single drop, or every single morsel, or every single taste is not completed.’

[^1]: (236:1) The stîr is evidently taken here as equivalent to the Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâm of Sls. V, 3 (see the last note). A sin of three Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâms, ‘lashes with a scourge,’ is called a Farmân, and is usually the least degree of sin of which notice is taken; its amount is variously estimated (see Sls. IV, 14, X, 24, XI, 2, XVI, 1, 5), but the value given here, in the text, is very likely correct, and is equivalent to about 4 1/5 rûpîs, either in weight or amount (see Chap. LII, r n).

[^2]: (236:2) The word Ithâ. M14 has ‘every single time it is spoken in tasting with an efficacy like that word,’ but the meaning of this is not clear.

[^3]: (236:3) See § 4.
