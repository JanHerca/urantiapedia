## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER VI.

1\. The fifth question is that you ask thus: Why does evil always happen more _to_ the good than to the bad?

2\. The reply is this, that not _at_ every time and every place, _and_ not _to_ all the good, does evil happen more—for the spiritual welfare of the good is certainly more—but in the world it is very much more manifest [^1]. 3. And the reasons for it are many; one which is conclusive is even this, that the modes <span id="p24"><sup><small>[ p. 24 ]</small></sup></span> and causes of _its_ occurrence are more; for the occurrence of evil is more particularly appointed (vakhtŏ) by two modes, one by the demons, the appointers of evil, _and_ one by the vile, the doers of evil; even to the vileness of creation and the vile they cause vexation. 4. Moreover, incalculable is the evil which happens to the vile from the demons, and that to the good from the demons and also from the vile, and the mode of its occurrence is in the same way without a demon.

5\. This, too, is more particularly such as the ancients _have_ said, that the labour and trouble of the good are much more in the world, and their reward _and_ recompense are more certain in the spiritual _existence_; and the comfort and pleasure of the vile are more in the world, and their pain _and_ punishment in the spiritual _existence_ are more severe. 6. And this, too, is _the case_, that the good; through fear of the pain and punishment of hell, should forsake the comfort and ease in the world, and should not think, speak, _or_ do anything improper whatever. 7. And through hope for the comfort and pleasure in heaven they should accept willingly, for the neck [^2], much trouble _and_ fear in the practice of virtue in thought, word, _and_ deed.

8\. The vile, through provision with temporary enjoyment [^3]\—even that enjoyment of improprieties for which eventually there is hell—then enjoy themselves <span id="p25"><sup><small>[ p. 25 ]</small></sup></span> therein temporarily, and lustfully on account of selfishness; those various actions also, through which _there_ would be a way to heaven, they do not trouble themselves with.

9\. And in this way, in the world, the comfort and pleasure of the vile are more, and the anxiety, vexation, despondency, and distress of the good _have_ become more; the reason is revealed by the stars [^4].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (23:1) M14 and J have ‘but the worldly evil and bondage are in-calculably more manifest about the good, much more in the season (zêmânîh) of Srôsh.’ The ‘season of Srôsh’ may perhaps mean the night-time, or the three nights after death, when the protection of the angel Srôsh is most wanted; but Dastûr Peshotanji Behramji, the high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay, prefers reading zîmânash (with a double pronominal suffix), and has favoured me with the following free translation of the whole passage:--‘At every time and every place much evil does not happen _to_ all the good; for the good, after having been separated from this world, receive (as a reward for their suffering evil) much goodness in the next world, which goodness is (regarded as) of a very high degree in religious doctrines (srôsh).’ Perhaps, after all, Srôsh is a miswriting of saryâ, ‘bad, evil.’

[^2]: (24:1) The word can be read either garêvan, ‘collar,’ or gardûn, ‘neck,’ and is the usual Pâz. of the Huz. <i>k</i>avarman (Chald.  ?Cַ?W.ַ?Rָ?A), ‘the neck,’ though ‘neck’, is often expressed by gar<i>d</i>ûn. The meaning is that the yoke of trouble and fear should be accepted.

[^3]: (24:2) M14 and J have ‘through provision with the enjoyment of improprieties which is temporarily theirs.’

[^4]: (25:1) That is, it is dependent upon destiny.
