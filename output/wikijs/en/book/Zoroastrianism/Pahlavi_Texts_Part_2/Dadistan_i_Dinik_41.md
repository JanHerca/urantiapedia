## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XLI.

1\. _As to_ the fortieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: Of those whose decision is this, that it is not necessary to be steadfast in the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers—by _which_ decision this is asserted, _that_ they should abandon the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers—_some one_ disparages the religion _and_ goes over to a foreign faith (an-aîrîh), then of what nature is his sin <span id="p137"><sup><small>[ p. 137 ]</small></sup></span> owing thereto, _and_ what does the sin owing thereto, as regards those of the same foreign religion, amount to? 2. Or order _some one_ then to tell us clearly concerning it, how it is, and how is the disobedience due to this sin.

3\. The reply is this, that an adult is worthy of death [^1] on account of the good religion they [^2] would abandon, on account also of the adopted law of the foreign faith _he_ is worthy of death, in whose reliance upon the improper law is also the sin which they [^3] maintain _and_ practise by law, and through _being_ in the same law _he_ is equally sinful with them. 4. And also when any one is on that course, and his wish is _for_ the same protection, of which a similitude is _in_ the enduring words of that good law they would forsake, and he adopts that which is vile [^4], even through that impropriety _he_ is equally sinful.

5\. When he dies, without renunciation [^5] _of that sin_ and impenitently, in that improperly-constituted law, the position of his soul is then in the worst <span id="p138"><sup><small>[ p. 138 ]</small></sup></span> existence [^6], and his punishment is that of many _sins_ worthy of death; from the demons also _there_ come grievously, hand in hand, pain and suffering, gnawing and stench of many kinds, stinging, tearing, and lacerating, primary evil and discomfort. 6. And through their [^7] law and faith his distress in that worst existence is thus until the last change of existence, when the renovation _of the universe_ is produced by will among living beings.

7\. But reality (aîtŏîh), as regards living, arises from renunciation of that disobedience; it makes those attract to the good law who seduced him to that evil law, that which established him improperly in the law it eradicates from _his_ conduct (rûbâkîh), advancing sins it again restrains, and whatever _has_ advanced it repairs again anew through the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, _and_ he becomes thoughtful, constant, and steadfast. 8. The sin which he set going he restrains and atones for by wealth, trouble, and authorising [^8] commands; even in the body he also undergoes punishment in the three _nights_ (satûîh) [^9]; he then obtains forgiveness, and his soul is saved.

9\. And as _it_ is said in the persistent law of the sacred beings [^10], that ‘the good religion of the sacred beings, who are the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping superiors, <span id="p139"><sup><small>[ p. 139 ]</small></sup></span> ordains _it_ as retribution,’ so that the sin it takes away (spayêiti) [^11] may not exist in him, his retribution is declared by revelation. 10. And by the same witness _it_ is said, that all of the primitive faith have been quite of the same opinion about this, that from the good religion except by [^12] the way of renunciation _of sin_ there is none unless to hell; but that renunciation _should_ be during life, for it is said that ‘whoever _when_ living does not become righteous, that is, does not fully atone for sin, _for_ him _when_ dead _there_ is no grant of [^13] the best existence.’ 11. To commit no sin is better than retribution _and_ renunciation of sin.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (137:1) That is, he commits a mortal sin, for which he could have formerly been condemned to death- by the high-priest (see Sls. VIII, 2, 5-7, 21).

[^2]: (137:2) The teachers of infidelity.

[^3]: (137:3) The foreigners.

[^4]: (137:4) The probable meaning is that if he conforms to the foreign faith merely from politic motives, while retaining a belief in his own religion, he is still equally sinful.

[^5]: (137:5) This renunciation is effected by the recitation of a particular formula called the Patit, in which every imaginable sin is mentioned with a declaration of repentance of any such sins as the reciter may have committed. But this formal renunciation must. be accompanied by atonement and true repentance; and in order to ascertain the proper atonement all serious sins must be confessed to the high-priest (see Sls. IV, 14, VIII, 1, 2, 8-10).

[^6]: (138:1) See Chap. XXXIII, 3.

[^7]: (138:2) The ‘foreigners’.

[^8]: (138:3) Or, tûbânkâr, may mean ‘lavish.’ The ordering of religious ceremonies, as good works in atonement for sin, is probably in-tended; and these always imply a lavish expenditure upon the priesthood.

[^9]: (138:4) Referring to the three nights' punishment after the resurrection of the body, which is specially reserved for mortal sinners (see Bd. XXX, 10).

[^10]: (138:5) Quoting, with some alteration, from Pahl. Vend. III, 151.

[^11]: (139:1) The Avesta verb spayêiti, here used as a technical term, occurs frequently in Vend. III, 142.-148.

[^12]: (139:2) Assuming that ba<i>r</i>â, ‘indeed,’ stands for pavan, ‘by,’ (see Chap. VII, 2 n.)

[^13]: (139:3) Reading bakhshi<i>s</i>n-î, but it may be a corruption of bakhshând,‘ they shall grant,’ as assumed in M14. This passage is quoted from Pahl. Vend. V, 173.
