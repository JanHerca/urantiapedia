## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XV.

1\. The fourteenth question is that which you ask thus: Is the eradication of life the gnawing of dogs and birds upon the corpse? And does the sin of those who suppose _it_ [^1] a sin proceed from _that_ origin, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that the decrease of sin and increase of good works, owing to good thoughts, good words, _and_ good deeds, arise really from the effort and disquietude which come on by means of the religion the soul practises, _and_ through the strength in effort, steadfastness of religion, and <span id="p35"><sup><small>[ p. 35 ]</small></sup></span> protection of soul _which_ the faithful possess. 3. That evil which _occurs_ when doing good works, which is the one (hand,) when doing iniquity, and when one strives _it_ is the one when he does not strive, the one when content and the one when not content, and after _it is_ undesired, and no cause of good works is with it, it occurs just as undesired, for the sake of favour and reward, is the certain eradication of life. 4. It happens once only (aêtûm) unto the righteous and the wicked, every one _who_ may have received the reward—that reward is living until the time of passing _away_\—but the gnawing of dogs and birds does not happen unto every one and every body. 5. It is necessary _for those_ to act very differently [^2] whose understanding of good works is owing to proper heed of dead matter; and, on account of the rapid change (var<i>d</i>î-hastanŏ) of that pollution, and a desire of atonement for sin, they should carry the body of _one_ passed _away_ out to a mountain-spur (kôf vakhsh), _or_ a place of _that_ description, enjoining unanimously that the dogs and birds may gnaw it, owing to the position of the appointed place [^3]. 6. Therefore, as owing to that fear [^4], the commands of religion, and progressive <span id="p36"><sup><small>[ p. 36 ]</small></sup></span> desire _it_ is accepted strenuously for the wicked himself, his own recompense is therein, and it happens to him in that way for the removal (narafsi<i>s</i>nŏ) of sin _and_ for the gratification of _his_ soul.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (34:3) The exposure of the dead, apparently; but the construction of this question and its relation to the reply are by no means clear at first sight. From §§ 2, 5, 6 we have to infer that the exposure is a meritorious action rather than a sin; and from §§ 3, 4 we have to gather that as loss of life occurs to every one, and exposure of the corpse only to some, the former cannot be caused by the latter.

[^2]: (35:1) Differently from others.

[^3]: (35:2) The dead must be deposited upon some dry and barren spot, remote from habitations and water, and, if possible, upon the summit of a hill (see Chap. XVII, 17, and Vend. VI, 93). From the mention of dogs gnawing the corpse it would appear that the depositories for the dead were less enclosed when this work was written than they are at present; and in ancient times both enclosed and unenclosed depositories seem to have been used (see Vend. VI, 92-106). For a description of the present form of such depositories see Sls. II, 6, note.

[^4]: (35:3) Fear of pollution from the dead.
