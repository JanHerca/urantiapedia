## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXVIII.

1\. _As to_ the sixty-seventh question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: What is this which, when the sun and moon _have_ both come up, is something [^1] <span id="p211"><sup><small>[ p. 211 ]</small></sup></span> come, _and_ comes on as _it were_ anew when it (the moon) becomes new, _and_ men want the thing to go down from the place _where it_ is becoming apparent? 2. When it _has_ been several times, what is then the thing _which_ comes up _and_ exists, and how is its motion by night and day?

3\. The reply is this, that the sun and moon are always seen [^2] there where they stand, and they exist for men and the creatures. 4. The sun is swifter-moving [^3] than the moon, _and_ every day becomes a little in advance; at the new moon the sun is shining, and the moon owing to diminution backwards, on account of the slenderness of the moon by much travelling [^4], and on account of the brilliance of the sun, is not apparent. 5. As the sun goes down a light which is not very apparent is the moon, and not _having_ gone down the moon is seen [^5]; and each day the moon increases, comes up more behind the sun, _and_ goes down more behind, _and_ is, therefore, more seen. 6. When increased to the utmost, which is approaching a likeness of the sun, it comes spherical (aspiharakŏ), and is seen the whole night; to diminish anew it comes back to the companionship of the sun, and goes into the splendour of the sun.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (210:4) The only probable reading for this word is mindavam, ‘a thing;’ it occurs three times in this question, but is a very vague term for the phases of the moon, probably referring to a supposed body covering the dark part of the moon's disc.

[^2]: (211:1) The MSS. have astî-hênd, ‘have remained,’ instead of khadîtunî-hênd, ‘are seen;’ but the difference between these words in Pahlavi letters is merely a medial stroke.

[^3]: (211:2) Apparently so, as the moon rises and sets about 48 minutes later every day, on the average.

[^4]: (211:3) A very anthropomorphic mode of accounting for the waning of the moon into a slender crescent.

[^5]: (211:4) Most Orientals consider the day of the new moon to be that in the evening of which it is first possible to see the moon; this is usually the first, but sometimes the second, day after the actual change of the moon according to European ideas.
