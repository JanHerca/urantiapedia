## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXVI.

1\. _As to_ the seventy-fifth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: _As to_ him who shall slay those who shall commit unnatural intercourse, how is then his account as to good works and crime?

2\. The reply is this, that the high-priests, in _their_ decision, _have_ thus specially said, that all worthy of death are _so_ by the decision of judges and the <span id="p224"><sup><small>[ p. 224 ]</small></sup></span> command of kings, whose business is execution. 3. Whoever shall slay him who _has_ heinous sins [^1] after controversies three times with him, about the decision of those acquainted with the religion _and about_ the command of kings, when he _has_ thus remained in the sin in defiance of his own relations--and not inimically to the man _and_ injuriously to the religion, but inimically to the sin _and_ in order to keep away intercourse with demons--is to consider _it_ as a great good work. 4. No command is given about the decision of _what one_ is to do _in_ the same matter, more heedfully and more authorisedly in _cases of_ doubtful attention, for the good work exists undoubtedly more _and_ more abundantly [^2].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (224:1) Reading vinâsânŏ, as in M14, instead of the doubtful word vashki<i>s</i>n, which might perhaps be compared with Pers. buzhi<i>s</i>, ‘opposition.’

[^2]: (224:2) The meaning is that no one is bound to put such sinners to death until they are condemned by the authorities, but should one do so upon his own responsibility, entirely for the good of the faith, and certain of the impenitence of the sinners, he is not only free from blame, but has done a meritorious deed.
