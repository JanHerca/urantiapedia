## EPISTLE II. TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER IV.

1\. _It_ [^1] is both explained again _and_ summarized _thus_:—If the decree be from a law of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, is it so decreed as he spoke it? and if they should never perform by that, do not bring the Avesta _and its_ exposition into the midst _of it_. 2. For the fifteen times _of_ which you _have_ written, if from the revelation of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, are his mode of _washing_ fifteen times upwards and fifteen times downwards [^2], a rule <span id="p342"><sup><small>[ p. 342 ]</small></sup></span> which is fulfilled. 3. _It_ is said, if _one's defilement be_ owing to depositing any bodily refuse (higar-1), then nothing of this is ever necessary for him, for one reckoning (mar-1) [^3] will smite that which he takes hold of with a finger and _it_ is clean, or it will smite a golden yellow clean, or whatever [^4] it shall smite is clean; but nothing _merely_ clean is purified, unless a demon be clean [^5].

4\. And this, too, is very amazing to me, that when this is not taken into account by you, that when there should be, _and one_ should obtain, no purifier [^6] it would then be necessary for him to operate himself [^7], how then is this knowledge obtained by you, on which information (âgahîh) _has_ reached you, that the purifying of all the purifiers of the country of Irân is just as they should always perform _it_. 5. When, as I consider, there is then no complete acquaintance _with_ the management of a house in you, its own master, in what manner then is our account of the gossip [^8], _and your_ information, about all the purifiers of the country of Irân <span id="p343"><sup><small>[ p. 343 ]</small></sup></span> obtained? 6. If your _people_ should abandon that _which is_ most indispensable, and your account of the gossip, as regards that which the whole realm _has_ done, _be_ not according to the commands of religion and to sound wisdom; _and_ if it has not come completely to your knowledge as the washing of the purifiers of the country of Irân—because, when you do not fix the number even of their footsteps [^9], _it_ is certain that _your_ understanding of their disposition _and_ virtuous practice is even less—then it was necessary for you to determine the reason that all the purifiers in the country of Irân always wash that way that is declared as improper, with whatever certainty _it be_ uttered _or_ written.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (341:4) His own line of argument.

[^2]: (341:5) See Chap. III, 2.

[^3]: (342:1) That is, a single washing, which is sufficient for ordinary defilements unconnected with the dead.

[^4]: (342:2) This is doubtful; the word seems to be <i>k</i>îkê in Pâzand, but, as the Av. î and û are much alike in Iranian MSS., it may be read <i>k</i>ûk-ê, and the phrase would then be ‘or it will smite a penis clean.’

[^5]: (342:3) That is, cleanliness can no more be considered purification than a demon, who is supposed to be an embodiment of impurity, can be considered clean.

[^6]: (342:4) J has ‘when there should be no purifier it would be necessary to beg the help of a chief of the religion, and when _one_ should not obtain _that_.’

[^7]: (342:5) As directed in Vend. VIII, 299 (see App. V).

[^8]: (342:6) Reading va<i>k</i> sakhûn, but this is uncertain.

[^9]: (343:1) Referring probably either to the distance of the Bareshnûm place from pure objects, or to the distances between the holes or ablution seats, and from them to the furrows, mentioned in Vend. IX, 12, 24, 18, 22 (see App. IV).
