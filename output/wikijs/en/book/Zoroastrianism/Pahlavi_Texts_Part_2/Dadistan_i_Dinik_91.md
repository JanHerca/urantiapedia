## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XCI.

1\. _As to_ the ninetieth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: From what is the sky made, _and_ with what is it prepared?

2\. The reply is this, that the sky is a dome (gardûn), wide _and_ lofty; its inside and whole width and boundaries (âkhyakîhâ), besides its material existence, are the stone of light, of all stones the hardest [^1] _and_ most beautiful; and the grandeur of its spirit _and_ even _its_ internal bow [^2] are like _those of_ mighty warriors arrayed. 3. And that material of the sky reached unto the place _where_ promise-breaking words exist [^3], _and_ was without need of preparation; _as_ it is said _of_ places such as those—where wisdom is a witness about _them_\—that _that_ which is not even itself a place, and its place does not yet exist, is without need of any preparing [^4].

4\. The light is for existing things, and they cherish a faculty (nîyûîh) of motion also of two <span id="p260"><sup><small>[ p. 260 ]</small></sup></span> kinds, _that_ causing motion _and that_ of movables [^5]; as mobility is mentioned about thought [^6] and immobility about material things. 5. Immovables are not moved, while movables are moved by their power of movement; and those movables, that way causing motion, are afterwards themselves a moving secret cause of motion, and then a cause of motion is not moving the movable, since _it_ is not incapable of causing motion secretly by movement of itself. 6. Just as the force (kûni<i>s</i>nŏ) of a movement exists _and_ does not become a force; only then it is declared by wisdom, that the causers of motion have been the causing of motion by force before movement, _and, being_ unmoved, they are subsequently made to move by the force; later on, the causers of motion _have_ to cause motion, by their power of causing motion, _in_ the non-causers of motion, from which it is certain though the force of a movement exists it does not become a force; but, finally, that _which is_ prepared with a source of activity [^7], before force, becomes unmoved.

7\. Natures without need of the trouble of a preparer are distinguished from such; where movement occurs through every force, the championship of a position (gâh) not made to move—except, indeed, _of that_ whose force, when it is unmoved by other force, is its own—is unmoving and thirstless [^8]. 8. _It_ <span id="p261"><sup><small>[ p. 261 ]</small></sup></span> _was_ restored immovably when _there was_ an approach to the sky of that actual contender for the place, the fiend, and the sky _was_ shaken by him; for connected with the sky _were_ arranged so many possessors of all resources, dignified (afrankî<i>d</i>) by their. own all-powerful position and that well-operating, mighty, undrawn bow [^9], righteous _and_ well-discoursing (hûfravakhsh), and many good spirits, gloriously co-operating for the preparation of the sky. 9. For that which _was_ not even itself a place [^10], when _it_ is thus henceforth really a place, is _in_ want of preparing; _and_, in the preparation _of_ that visible [^11] place, with the material of the sky is mingled that triumphing, powerful spirit who made its existence a seeking for principle _and_ seeking for intention, drawing up from below _and_ drawing down from above, so that through that seeking for principle it becomes a concord, the resting-place of united champions, and unadmonishable through that power of seeking for intention; such as this _it is_ if, indeed, _it be_ the will of him, the creator of all goodness.

10\. And it is said summarily that the sky was shaken in the _period of_ disturbance and restored _with_ trouble; and, if the guardian spirits are in freedom from disturbance through the glory _of_ the creator, when there is not even a place for it prepared by themselves [^12], and _their_ nature and own <span id="p262"><sup><small>[ p. 262 ]</small></sup></span> strength are approving the trouble of preparation, it is not moved [^13], except by the creatures of _his_ will, a will which is subduing.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (259:1) The same notion as that indicated in Genesis by the word ‘firmament.’

[^2]: (259:2) The rainbow.

[^3]: (259:3) Probably meaning that the sky extends downwards, below the horizon, as far as the second grade of hell, that for ‘evil words,’ Du<i>s</i>\-hûkht (see Sls. VI, 3, note).

[^4]: (259:4) The word dîvâk, ‘place’ (zîvâk in the Sasanian inscription of Naq<i>s</i>\-i Rustam, but traditionally pronounced <i>g</i>înâk), seems to be here taken in the etymological sense of zîvâk, that is, ‘a living-place.’ The text refers to the period, in the beginning, when the sky was indefinite space unprepared for the residence of creatures and merely a region of light (see Bd. I, 2), the light mentioned in § 4. Its preparation is referred to in §§ 8, 9.

[^5]: (260:1) M14 has ‘movables _and_ immovables’ instead of this clause.

[^6]: (260:2) Perhaps we should read ‘the spirits,’ by inserting an additional medial stroke in the Pahlavi word.

[^7]: (260:3) Reading tûkhshînîkîhâ, instead of the unintelligible tûkhshtîkîhâ'. The author has so nearly lost sight of his argument in the mazes of his verbiage that there is some uncertainty about the translation of this paragraph.

[^8]: (260:4) That is, the guardians of a place exposed to all attacks (as p. 261 the sky is supposed to be), unless it is a stronghold in itself, must be always on the alert.

[^9]: (261:1) The rainbow; reading atan<i>g</i> darûn.

[^10]: (261:2) That is, ‘a living-place’ (see § 3 n).

[^11]: (261:3) Reading dî<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘seen;’ but it may be stô for stî, ‘material.’

[^12]: (261:4) That is, while the sky was still indefinite space, the region of light, but, no dwelling-place; although the guardian spirits had p. 261 been created as representatives of the creatures, both spiritual and material, which were to be afterwards produced (see Bd. I, 8).

[^13]: (262:1) That is, when afterwards prepared as a dwelling-place the sky remains unmoved by evil beings.
