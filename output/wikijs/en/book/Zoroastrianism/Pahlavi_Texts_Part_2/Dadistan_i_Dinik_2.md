## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER II.

1\. First you ask thus: Why is a righteous man created better than the stars and moon _and_ sun and fire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and is called in revelation greater and better than the spiritual creation, _and_ also than that which is worldly?

2\. The reply is this, that the greatness and goodness of advance in wisdom and just judgment over the creatures arise from proficiency (hûnar). 3. Justice is the one good proficiency over the creatures, the means of wisdom are great, and praise bestowed is the most effectual performance <span id="p12"><sup><small>[ p. 12 ]</small></sup></span> of what is desirable (kâmi<i>s</i>n-karîh). 4. For all three are mutually connected together; since the manifestation of justice is through wisdom, and its advantage is the performance of what is desirable for the creator; wisdom is the performance of what is desirable for the requirements of the creator, and its weapon (zênô) is justice; and the desire of the creator, which is progress, is in wisdom with justice. 5. All three are great among the creatures, and their lodgment in the superior beings and righteous men is spiritual, in the spirit which is the pure guardian angel [^1], _in_ the understanding for encountering, averting, smiting, and prostrating (khvâpâk) the fiend, _in_ the army of angels, and in the sovereignty of the far-seeing (dûr-vênâko) [^2] spirit, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and, materially, in the worldly equipment and mutual connection of body _and_ life. 6. And their appliances are the wisdom and worldly efficacy of treatises on the wise adoption of good thoughts, good words, _and_ good deeds, _and_ the relinquishment _and_ discontinuance of evil thoughts, evil words, _and_ evil deeds. 7. And their acquirer is the worldly ruler who is providing for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and approving and stimulating the pure religion, a praiser of the good and pure creator, and a director of persistence in destruction of the fiend. 8. And in the promulgation <span id="p13"><sup><small>[ p. 13 ]</small></sup></span> (rûbâkŏ-dahi<i>s</i>nîh) of the good and religious liturgy (mânsar), the coming of the good cause of the resurrection, and the production of the renovation _of the universe_ [^1] are _his_ cŏoperation and his own thanksgiving; and over the creatures of _this_ prior world _he_ is a guardian, defender, and manager.

9\. And _such rulers_ are great and pre-eminent; yet every man is not for that greatness, but it is mentioned as to superior beings _and_ concerning righteous men, in whom it _has_ arisen, and the best are the three who are the beginning, middle, _and_ end of the creation. 10. One is the pure man, Gâyômar<i>d</i>, who was its first rational praiser; he in whose keeping _was_ the whole creation of the sacred beings, from _its_ beginning and immaturity unto the final completion of the worldly creatures, over which _was_ the exercise of goodness of his well-destined progeny, such as Hôshâng, Tâkhmôrup, Yim, and Frê<i>d</i>ûn [^2], such as the apostles of the religion, like Zaratû<i>s</i>t, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, and Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh [^3], and the producers of the renovation _of the universe_, like Sôshâns [^4], Rôshanô-<i>k</i>ashm, and <span id="p14"><sup><small>[ p. 14 ]</small></sup></span> Khûr-<i>k</i>ashm [^1]. 11. The approver [^2] of the enterprises (rûbâk-dahi<i>s</i>nîhâ) of cŏoperators, the purely-praising and just worshipper of the sacred beings through the strength of the spirit, the disabler of the worldly activity of the fiend as regards worldly bodies, and the one of pure religion--which is his charge (spôr) [^3], the revelation of the place of the beneficent spirit and of the destruction of the depravity of the evil spirit [^4], the subjugation (khvâpi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the fiend, the completion of the triumph of the creator, and the unlimited progress of the creatures--is the upholder of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship. 12. And likewise through the goodness of Gâyômar<i>d</i>, which is the begetting of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _he_ is also just; likewise through the goodness of Sôshâns, by which he is the progeny of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _he_ is also progressive in every good thought, good word, _and_ good deed, _more_ than the creatures which are produced with a hope of the religion, and equally thankful. 13. And one is the producer of bodies [^5], <span id="p15"><sup><small>[ p. 15 ]</small></sup></span> the renovator (frashagar) Sôshâns, who is the putter down, with complete subjugation from the world, of the glorification of fiends _and_ demons, and of the contention with angels in apostasy and heterodoxy of various kinds and unatoned for; and the completer of the renovation through the full continuance of the glorification of the angels, and the perfect continuance of the pure religion.

14\. And through that excellent, unblemished, brotherly work [^1] _such a ruler_ may be seen above the sun with swift horses, the primeval luminaries, and all removal of darkness, the advance of illumination which is the display (tô<i>g</i>isnŏ) of the days _and_ nights of the world [^2]. 15. Regarding the same completion of the renovation _of the universe_ it is said in the revelation of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, that this great light is the vesture of the like righteous men.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (12:1) The fravâhar or fravashi, which is the prototype or spiritual counterpart supposed to have been created in the beginning for each good creature and creation afterwards produced, whether material or immaterial, and whose duty is to represent the creature and watch over its interests in the spiritual world.

[^2]: (12:2) This word is badly written in K35, so that it has become zôrînâk in later MSS., which might perhaps mean ‘strength--exerting.’

[^1]: (13:1) Which is expected to take place about the time of the resurrection (see Bd. XXX, 32).

[^2]: (13:2) The first four rulers of the world (omitting the usurper Dahâk) after Gâyômar<i>d</i> (see Bd. XXXI, 1-3, 7). The five names of these primeval sovereigns are corruptions of the Avesta names, Gaya-maretan, Haoshyangha, Takhmô-urupa, Yima, and Thraêtaona. The third name is always written Tâkhmôrî<i>d</i>ŏ in Dd.

[^3]: (13:3) Corruptions of Av. Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-ereta, and Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-nemangh. The last two are future apostles still expected by the Parsis to restore their religion to its original purity, in preparation for the resurrection (see Bd. XXXII, 2-10, Byt. III, 13, 43-48, 52, 53).

[^4]: (13:4) Av. Saoshyãs. The last of the future apostles, in whose p. 14 time the universe is expected to be renovated and the resurrection to take place (see Bd. XXX, 4-27, XXXII, 8, Byt. III, 62).

[^1]: (14:1) These two names, which mean ‘bright-eyed’ and ‘sunny-eyed,’ are the Av. Rao<i>k</i>as-<i>k</i>aêshman and Hvare-<i>k</i>aêshman of Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 128 (see also Chap. XXXVI, 4).

[^2]: (14:2) This is Zaratû<i>s</i>t (see § 12), the righteous apostle of the middle portion of the history of creation referred to in § 9.

[^3]: (14:3) Or ‘which is wholly his.’

[^4]: (14:4) These two spirits are supposed to be the authors of all the good and evil, respectively, that exists in creation. They appear, originally, to have been both supposed to spring from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, who speaks of ‘the more beneficent of my two spirits’ in Yas. XIX, 21; but in later times, and throughout the Pahlavi literature, the beneficent spirit is identified with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the origin of the evil spirit is left in obscurity.

[^5]: (14:5) The renovated bodies of the future existence which are prepared for mankind at the resurrection (see Bd. XXX, 4, 7, 25-27).

[^1]: (15:1) Mentioned in §§ 7, 8.

[^2]: (15:2) M14 and J have ‘_such rulers_’ own praise is above the sun with swift horses, the primeval luminaries, and all good creatures; for that, too, which may be seen when the light of the sun is owing to the removal of darkness, and the removal is the advance of illumination of the world, is the display of days _and_ nights.'
