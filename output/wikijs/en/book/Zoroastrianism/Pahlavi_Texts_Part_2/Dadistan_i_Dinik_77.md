## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXXVII.

1\. _As to_ the seventy-sixth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: Will you direct _some one_ then to make the heinousness of this sin of unnatural intercourse clear to us?

2\. The reply is this, that the first material creature _was_ the righteous man, the smiter of the fiend, the righteous propitiator; so, also, in the world _he_ is more recognising the sacred beings, more completely (hamâktar) for the production of creatures, <span id="p225"><sup><small>[ p. 225 ]</small></sup></span> and with more provision for the creatures [^1]. 3. And with the manifestation of knowledge the best duty is that which _exists_ in lawfully practising procreation, _and_ the complete progression of righteous men arose therefrom.

4\. In like manner he who is the omniscient creator formed mankind in the first pair, who were brother and sister, _and_ became Mashyâîh and Mashyâyôîh [^2], and all races of material life _exist_ by means of acquiring sons and _his_ omnisciently causing procreation. 5. The man and woman _were_ also made to lust (gâmîni<i>d</i>ŏ) by him, and thereby _became_ the father and mother of material men; and he naturalized among primitive man the qualities of a desire (âlû<i>d</i>anŏ) for acquiring sons together through glorifying. 6. And the law _and_ religion authorised it as a proper wish, so long as _they proceed_ from those who are their own _relations_, not from those who are not their own; and with those whom next-of-kin marriages [^3], original duties, and desires for other sons have formed, complete progress in the world is connected, and even unto the time of the renovation _of the universe_ [^4], it is to arise therefrom. 7. And the birth of many glorious practisers of the religion, those confident in spirit, organizers of the realm, arrangers of the country, _and_ even accomplishers <span id="p226"><sup><small>[ p. 226 ]</small></sup></span> of the renovation _of the universe_, which _arises_ from _those_ same _to_ whom that practice shall be law--and when it occurs lawfully--is a miracle and benefit of the world, the will of the sacred beings and the utmost good work discernible, because the complete progress of the righteous arises therefrom, and the great female faculty (nekedîh) is manifested.

8\. So when the opponent of the same, by whom the source _of_ seed _and_ procreation is spoiled, is intent upon a way for the death of progeny--and the intention is certain--_its_ annihilation is owing to him [^5]; and he is the devastating fiend [^6], whose will is a desire of depopulation and ruin, and by the power of his Nîyâ<i>z</i> (_demon of_ ‘want’) [^7] he turns imperceptibly the esteem of the very indispensable production of men from the position of wishing for sons to a creature [^8] who is opposed to it, through whom have arisen its ruin _and_ corruption. 9. And the nature and power which are his cherishing of progeny are not suitable for receiving seed, and misrepresented (drôkînî<i>d</i>ŏ) by him is the accompanying evil intercourse, so that emitting the seed (shûdak), in delivering _it_ at that time into that burning place, full of stench, is to produce _its_ death, _and_ no procreation occurs.

10\. The dupes [^9] turn the living seed from mingling with women _and_ seeking for births, just as in the like vice of any demon, connected with a longing <span id="p227"><sup><small>[ p. 227 ]</small></sup></span> for the dupes [^10], they shall abandon that advantage of the world, the delights (vâyagânŏ) of a son [^11]. 11. He who is wasting seed makes a practice of causing the death of progeny; when the custom is completely continuous, which produces an evil [^12] stoppage of the progress of the race, the creatures _have_ become annihilated; _and_ certainly, that action, from which, when it is universally proceeding, the depopulation of the world must arise, _has_ become and furthered (frârâstŏ) the greatest wish of Aharman [^13]. 12. Such a practiser is the greatest wish of Aharman, through the demon's excretion [^14] of doubt _in_ the practice, owing to intercourse with the emitter, _which_ is most filthy and most fetid, and the emitting member, which is causing death; and the demoniacal practice [^15] is perceptible even from the same practice, and whatever is the heinousness _of_ the sinfulness is clear to observers of the dead _body_.
