## EPISTLE III. TO ALL OF THE GOOD RELIGION IN IRAN.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

_In_ the name of the sacred beings.

A copy of the notification (vishâ<i>d</i>akŏ') of _his_ priestly lordship Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, regarding the grievous sinfulness of _assuming_ the propriety of washing for fifteen times.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

_In_ the name of the sacred beings.

1\. It _has_ come unto the ears (va<i>s</i>ammûni<i>s</i>nŏ) of me, Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, pontiff (ra<i>d</i>) of Pârs _and_ Kirmân [^1], that, in some quarters of the country of Irân, they whose chance happens _to be_ so much [^2] pollution, such as is decreed unto so much washing of the customary _parts_ (pî<i>s</i>akŏ), always wash _themselves_ fifteen times with bull's urine and once with water, consider themselves as clean [^3], and go to water, fire, and _ceremonial_ ablution, the ablution <span id="p360"><sup><small>[ p. 360 ]</small></sup></span> of the sacred twigs. 2. Such--although [^1] they say that Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam [^2], son of Yûdân-Yim, _has_ ordered, _and_ the high-priests _have_ appointed, washing of this kind--_has_ appeared to my well-reflecting (hû-min) opinion, apprehension, and appreciation very marvellous _and_ grave, and _merely_ a rumour. 3. And _it_ is needful for me to keep those of the good religion in _all_ quarters of the country of Irân informed concerning the placing reliance upon their washing with the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ [^3], _and_ to make my own opinion clear also as regards the writings collected.

4\. And, first of all, about the indispensability of the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ I write several such copies of a well-matured writing of mine [^4] as may even be new light to the intelligent. 5. That my opinion of the information provided by revelation, the decisions _of_ high-priests, _and_ the teachings _of_ those of the primitive faith is thus, that washing by the polluted with water is pollution for the life and spiritual life (ahvô) [^5]; they render the material _body_ clean thereby, _but_ that which is known as the handiwork [^6] of the immortals, and is also professionally called the Bareshnûm, when _there is_ the protection of a ritual of _various_ kinds, shall make the body clean from endless worldly attacks.

6\. It is in the nine ablution seats (magakŏ) [^7] and the furrow [^8], even with prayer, bull's urine, water, <span id="p361"><sup><small>[ p. 361 ]</small></sup></span> and other appliances, and the ritual which is such as is declared in the teaching of revelation; and even now the purifiers, who are just as written _about_ below, keep _it_ in use. 7. When there is a washing they wash just as in the well-teaching statements which are known as _those_ of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, of Afarg, and of Sôshâns [^1], or _in_ the statement of one of those three teachings, or in the statement of one of the high-priests _by_ whom those three teachings are declared as propriety, or has come unto me as the practice of those same three teachings _by_ those of the primitive faith.

8\. I deem _this_ deliverance [^2] one wholly approvable, and the washer _in_ a washing of that kind, with the Bareshnûm _ceremony_\--which is lawfully _of_ that description--I consider as a purifier who is approvable. 9. And the polluted of every description, as _above_ written, who _have_ obtained, for any indispensable reason whatever, a purifier, as _above_ written, whom even now various districts _and_ various places have appointed _and_ approved, are able to wash with the Bareshnûm ceremony as _above_ written. 10. Then their washing fifteen times is no deliverance in any way, and to wash them quickly with the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ as _above_ written is indispensable.

11\. Owing to a washing of the same kind through the Bareshnûm _ceremony_, as is intended, water, fire, and other _things_, not to provide care for which is un [^3] . . . . . . . . . . authorisedly is grievously sinful. <span id="p362"><sup><small>[ p. 362 ]</small></sup></span> 12. When, on account of a cleansing through another washing, distinct from the Bareshnûm ceremony, <span id="p363"><sup><small>[ p. 363 ]</small></sup></span> they consider themselves as clean _it_ is more grievously sinful; just as when they do not wash with the Bareshnûm, as _above_ written, _but_ consider themselves as clean through _washing_ fifteen times, as _above_ written, or on account of any washing whatever distinct from the Bareshnûm, _it_ is more grievously sinful; because, when they do not wash with a Bareshnûm, as _above_ written, _but_ wash for fifteen times, as _above_ written, or any washing whatever distinct from the Bareshnûm, as _above_ written, they do not become clean, through the professional washing which is decreed, from that pollution which remains [^1].

13\. When without similar trouble _and_ great judiciousness they go unto water _and_ fire, the sin is grievous; and when they go to the bowl (pa<i>d</i>mânŏ) for ablution of the sacred twigs [^2] _it_ is non-ablution advisedly, _and_ to perform the ceremonial therewith would not be authorised. 14. And, _in_ like manner, the washing of polluted Hôm _twigs_ [^3], for any indispensable purpose, with the Bareshnûm _ceremony_, as _above_ written, is not possible.

15\. Therefore, so that we _may_ obtain as _it were_ a remedy for it, I wash with the Bareshnûm _ceremony_, as _above_ written; to keep the mind steadfast _and_ to attain to a remedy I wash with the Bareshnûm, as _above_ written; _and_ to bestow the indispensable, comprehensive Bareshnûm, as _above_ written, is indeed a good work suitable for the discreet _and_ liberated <span id="p364"><sup><small>[ p. 364 ]</small></sup></span> from bonds, and the purification of body _and_ soul is connected with it.

16\. These _things_ those of the primitive faith, who provided for the moderns, _have_ communicated, whose position _was_ above us moderns who are now the law (gûn) of others, and are teachers and rulers; our station as regards them is the position (gâsîh) of disciples _to spiritual_ masters, _that of_ listeners _and_ servitors to form _and_ hold the opinion, about the same and other _things_, which those of the primitive faith formed; _and_ the teaching of even one of those high-priests is greater _and_ higher than our sayings and decisions.

17\. And _as to_ every custom there may be in the country of Irân, about casting away the Bareshnûm _ceremony_, as written by me, and about all the polluted, as _above_ written--whom _it_ is possible to wash, for any indispensable reason whatever, with the Bareshnûm as written by me, _and_ one does not wash with the Bareshnûm as _written_ by me, _but_ is ordered to wash for fifteen times, as written by me, _and_ to pronounce as clean--and _which_ is established as a rule _one_ is urged to practise, if Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam or any one else _has_ ordered, said, or decided in the name of authority _that one_ is to do _so, or has_ established _it_ as a rule, _or_ set _it_ going, this is to give authoritatively my opinion, decision, and enactment upon it likewise. 18. That _those_ same sayings are short-sighted (aê-vênakŏ), _that_ same order is unlawfully _given, that_ same decision is false teaching, _that_ same rule is vicious, _that_ same setting going is grievously sinful, and _that_ same authority is not to be accepted; _it_ is a practice, therefore, not to be performed, _and_ whoever _has_ performed it, is to <span id="p365"><sup><small>[ p. 365 ]</small></sup></span> engage quickly _in_ renunciation of it. 19. And he who _has_ decreed in the country of Irân, in the name of authority, washing of _other_ kinds _as_ all-remedial for the polluted, as _above_ written, _and has_ established a rule of that description is to be considered as a heretic (aharmôkô) deserving death.

20\. So, when through his wilfulness that kind of injury without enlightenment (bâm) is decreed, _and_ a rule of that description is established, as _above_ written, _and one_ rendered polluted is washed fifteen times with bull's urine _and_ once with water, or _in_ whatever other mode that is distinct from the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ as written by me, _though_ it is possible to wash him, for any indispensable reason whatever, with the Bareshnûm as _above_ written, then, his renunciation _of sin being_ accomplished, _he_ is to be washed again at the nine ablution seats (magh) [^1] with the Bareshnûm as written by me; _and_ until washed again, as written by me, _he_ is not to go to water and fire _and_ the bowl for ablution.

21\. And this epistle is written by me, in my own _hand_\-writing, for the sake of _all_ members whatever of the good religion of the country of Irân becoming aware of the opinion, apprehension, _and_ appreciation of the commands of religion _entertained by_ me, Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim; _and_ several copies are finished _in_ the month of the triumphant Ho<i>r</i>vada<i>d</i> of the year 250 of Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>aka<i>r</i><i>d</i> [^2].

22\. In trustfulness and gratitude to the sacred beings, _and_ homage to the exalted pontiff _sent_ from [^3] <span id="p366"><sup><small>[ p. 366 ]</small></sup></span> the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the heavenly, most righteous, _and_ glorified Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân. 23. For the sake of obtainments of prayers the one thing is the righteousness of the Spîtamân; great, good, _and_ perfect is Zaratû<i>s</i>t; one _only_ is the way of perfect righteousness, which is the way of those of the primitive faith; all the others, appointed afresh, are no ways [^1].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (359:1) See Dd. XCIV, 13.

[^2]: (359:2) Reading hâvan; but it may be ‘pollution of the spiritual life (ahvô),’ though this is hardly possible in the next phrase, where the same word occurs.

[^3]: (359:3) By confounding the preliminary washing appointed in Vend. VIII, 279 with the final washing appointed in Vend. VIII, 299 (see App. V, and compare Ep. II, iii, 2, ix, 2).

[^1]: (360:1) Reading amat, instead of the very similar word hamâî, ‘ever.’

[^2]: (360:2) See the headings to Eps. I, II.

[^3]: (360:3) See App. IV.

[^4]: (360:4) Meaning this epistle.

[^5]: (360:5) Because it pollutes pure water, which is considered a sin.

[^6]: (360:6) Reading yadman; but it may be gadman, ‘glory,’ which is written in precisely the same manner.

[^7]: (360:7) See Ep. I, ix, 7.

[^8]: (360:8) See Vend. IX, 21-28 (App. IV)

[^1]: (361:1) See Ep. I, v, 1.

[^2]: (361:2) From pollution.

[^3]: (361:3) At this point there is a blank page in K35, and also in the MS. belonging to Mr. Tehmuras Dinshawji, which is supposed to be older; and one line is left blank in BK. It is not, however, p. 362 quite certain that any text is really missing, as this section can be read continuously and translated as follows, without much difficulty:--‘_Apart_ from a washing of the same kind through the Bareshnûm _ceremony_, as is intended, _there_ would be a grievous sin _against_ water, fire, and other _things_, not to provide care for which would be unauthorised.’
  If some folios of text are missing, as seems quite possible from the terms applied to this epistle in § 4, the question arises whether a portion of the missing text may be contained in the following fragment on the subject of the Bareshnûm, which is appended to the passage (Ep. II, vi, 2-ix, 7) interpolated in Dd. XXXVII, 33 in the MS. J:--
  ‘As it is declared in revelation that, if a man who _has_ chanted comes upon a corpse, _whether_ a dog, or a fox, or a wolf, or a male, or a female, or any _creature_ on whose corpse it is possible _that_ he _may_ come, that good man becomes so that a man _may_ become defiled by him, _and_ it is necessary to wash the polluted _one_, so that it _may_ not make him a sinner. In order that they _may_ act _so_ to the polluted _one_ it is necessary to wash _him_, it is necessary to perform that Bareshnûm _ceremony_ of the nine nights. If the man that is spoken of _has_ worked about carrying the dead and contact with dead matter (nôsâ hamâlih), so that they know about his defilement to whom he comes, then he _who has_ done this work _in_ contact with dead matter becomes afterwards disabled _for_ that worship of the sacred beings which they perform. So, also, _some one_ says (compare Vend. VIII, 271-299), where in a wilderness (vyâvân) are several priests (âsrûvô) _and_ a man lies _on_ the road, there he _who_ carries the dead _body_ of the man who passes away--as those others remain _and_ stand away helpless, without offerings of _inward_ prayer (vâ<i>g</i>ŏ vakhtagân) over that person (kerpô) according to the religious way--_having_ washed his body, comes into the town and performs the nine nights’ Bareshnûm _ceremony_ twice; afterwards, his Gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> _ceremonies_ (see Dd. LXXIX, 4) are performed, _and_ he has acted well according to the religious way; then he comes into the ceremonial of the sacred beings. “How are those men purified, O righteous _one!_ who shall stand up by a corpse _which is_ very dry _and_ dead a year?” (See Pahl. Vend. VIII, 107, 108.) The reply is this, that “those men are purified; p. 363 for _it_ is not _to_ the dry from that dryness--that is, it would not act from this polluted _thing--that_ the existence _of_ dry diffusion _has_ arisen.”'

[^1]: (363:1) Even after the best ordinary washing.

[^2]: (363:2) See Dd. XLIII, 5.

[^3]: (363:3) See Dd. XLVIII, 16.

[^1]: (365:1) See §6.

[^2]: (365:2) The third month of the Parsi year 250, which corresponded to the interval between the 14th June and 13th July, 88 r.

[^3]: (365:3) Reading min, as in Ep. II, ix, 14, instead of mûn,‘ who.’

[^1]: (366:1) Compare Dd. XCIV, 14, Ep. II, ix, 15. This epistle is followed, in K35, by the Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, of which the first portion is translated in the fifth volume of the Sacred Books of the East.
