## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. CHAPTER XI.

1\. For completion little is observed by me; and a man of my own, _in_ a position of authority (sông gâh), comes with a second epistle [^1] for that priestly man, opposing, disputing, showing the harm, making <span id="p321"><sup><small>[ p. 321 ]</small></sup></span> aware of the deliverance [^2], and applying for arrangement. 2. And the man who comes as a co-operator is announced by me, _and_ the rite which is accomplished by him is _so_ till further _notice_, which is for my further epistle [^3]; because a double elucidation about that which it is necessary to arrange from afar is a custom more suitable for the discreet.

3\. If _that_ same priestly _man_ [^4] should have been in the vicinity, then interviews _with_ me, with a few words, _would have been_ more preservative than _trying_ to convert that wretchedness (vakhâr) into that which is customary (pî<i>s</i>akŏ) even by further writing and much information. 4. And even now my prospect is a well-considering demand for explanation, so that, if the duties which are suitable for the discreet _be_ really disposable for it, it is proper so to arrange what it is possible for me to complete _for_ three months; _and_ I _may_ go myself into the presence of _that_ same priestly _man_ for the arrangement of the indispensable duties, and _may_ diffuse this arrangement properly [^5]. 5. _But_ there are many reasons for private reflection (nâhî<i>d</i>ŏ) on account of which a descent from position is an evil resource; and _this_ once a temporary epistle is written by me to him, and comes with this epistle [^6]. 6. And <span id="p322"><sup><small>[ p. 322 ]</small></sup></span> Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân-pânak [^7], a man who is instructed [^8], shall come to him, _who_ is friendly to custom (âînag-îyâr), _and_ of like rank with his own man who is faithful; _and_ I _will_ write further _and_ more controversially to him, and give the information advisedly with which I _shall_ acquaint him, so that _it may be_ more explanatory to him.

7\. But if through this which is written by me, or _through_ myself [^9], he _should_ come immediately (di<i>g</i>andyî<i>s</i>) unto Pârs, I _shall_ then be seeking an opportunity even for the retirement of him himself; I do not abominate _it_ (madam lâ man<i>s</i>ôm) when it is necessary for them _and_ private, as is better.

8\. As to these other diffusions of arrangements which are pre-eminently the resources of that priestly man, and the acquaintance with revelation which is sought by him, for the sake of the advantage of the religion they should not be molested before [^10].

9\. May the arrangement and restoration and benediction of the revelation (dîn 6) of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion reach a climax! and may the <span id="p323"><sup><small>[ p. 323 ]</small></sup></span> eminence of you listeners [^11] to the primeval religion consist in long-continued, supreme prosperity, through all happiness! then, through such thoughtful friends, the acquaintance _with_ its difficult teaching and mighty words, which is to increase that gratitude of yours to me for my decisions, is made a blessing to you, if you observe therein a good idea which seems to you important, when it reaches your sight.

10\. The correct writer _and_ scribe is ordered that he do not alter _any_ of [^12] the words (mârîk), while he writes a fair copy of this epistle of mine, which is written by me to you, and he orders _some one_ to give _it_ to _that_ same man, Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân-pânak, _along_ with that epistle, so that it _may_ come to him [^13], for there are _times_ when I seem aware that _it_ is better _so_. 11. And may the angels increase _and_ enlarge your many new _things_ with full measure and complete exaltation! the pleasure, peace [^14], righteousness, prosperity, commendation, _and_ happiness _of_ the powerful [^15] who are all-controlling _and_ happy-ending.

12\. Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, _has_ written _it in_ the day _and_ month _of_ Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^16], in the <span id="p324"><sup><small>[ p. 324 ]</small></sup></span> enjoyment of righteousness, the glorification of the religion, trustfulness to the angels, and gratitude unto the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the archangels, _and_ all the angels of the spiritual _and_ the angels of the worldly _existences_. 13. Praise to the month (mâh) of like kind which is exalted in its name with this.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (320:3) Not Ep. II, but one which preceded it (see § 5, note).

[^2]: (321:1) From pollution, by means of the Bareshnûm ceremony.

[^3]: (321:2) Probably referring to Ep. II, till the arrival of which (or that of Ep. III) they were to act as directed by the priest he sends with this epistle.

[^4]: (321:3) His brother Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam.

[^5]: (321:4) This intended visit to Sîrkân is also mentioned in Ep. II, v, 5; vi, 4, 6; vii, 3.

[^6]: (321:5) Being apprehensive that personal interference might lead to altercations derogatory to his dignity, he prefers trying the effect of writing in the first place. The temporary epistle, here referred to, p. 322 could not have been Ep. II, as that was written after Ep. III, and was the further epistle promised in § 6.

[^7]: (322:1) Or, perhaps, Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân-pahnak. This was a common Parsi name in former times, as it is found in two of the Pahlavi inscriptions in the Kanheri caves, dated A.D. 1009 (see Indian Antiquary, vol. ix, pp. 266, 267), and the very similar name, Yazd-panâh, occurs as the name of a Parsi convert to Christianity who was put to death about A.D. 541 (see Hoffmann's Auszüge aus syrischen Akten persischer Märtyrer, p. 87).

[^8]: (322:2) Assuming that dinhâr<i>d</i>ŏ stands for zinhârî<i>d</i>ŏ.

[^9]: (322:3) If I should come personally.

[^10]: (322:4) Referring probably to further matters of complaint, which he did not think it advisable to notice seriously until the present controversy was settled.

[^11]: (323:1) Reading nyôkhshî<i>d</i>ârânŏ, as in J, instead of avakhshî<i>d</i>ârânŏ.

[^12]: (323:2) Reading min, instead of mûn, ‘who.’

[^13]: (323:3) To Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam. This copy was that mentioned in Ep. II, vii, I.

[^14]: (323:4) Reading slam, as in J; the other MSS. have shnuman, ‘propitiation,’ the two words being nearly alike in Pahlavi letters.

[^15]: (323:5) Reading patûgânŏ; J has pa<i>d</i>vandânŏ, ‘connections,’ by inserting a stroke.

[^16]: (323:6) The fifth day of the twelfth month of the Parsi year; and, as Ep. III (which was evidently written after further consideration) is dated in the third month of A. Y. 250, this must have been written in A.Y. 249. The date of this epistle, therefore, corresponds to the 15th March, 881.
