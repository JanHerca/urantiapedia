## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXVI.

1\. _As to_ the sixty-fifth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: _There is_ a man of wealth of the good religion who fully intends to order a _celebration of_ all _the rites_ of his religion; and a priest of it, to whom the five chapters (fragar<i>d</i>ŏ) of the Avesta (‘text’) of the correct law of the Nîrangistân (‘religious-formula code’) [^1] are easy through the Zand commentary, is ever progressing in priestly manhood (magôî-gab<i>r</i>âîh). 2. And he (the man) goes unto him, and he (the priest) speaks thus: ’All the religious rites are _performed_ for 350 _dirhams_ [^2], as a gift always given beforehand by them _who_ give the order unto me, so that I _may_ come to _them_.'

3\. A man of the disciples [^3], to whom the five <span id="p202"><sup><small>[ p. 202 ]</small></sup></span> sections (vîdag) of the Avesta are easy, and no-thing whatever of its Zand is easy [^4], then says unto him—unto that man who intends to order all the religious rites—thus: ‘For this gift I will conduct all the religious rites for thee twice, with the appliances in the land of Pârs [^5], shouldst thou give the order unto me. 4. For it is quite possible for me to pray so many sections through my own exertion (dastŏ), _but_ for him [^6] it is necessary to order again of an officiating priest (pavan zôtakŏ), who is himself not able to pray any section, _or_ does not himself pray; and it is not necessary for him to go for the control (parvâr) [^7] of all the religious rites when a stipend (bâhar) is the one consideration within him, _and_ the matter is _that_ he [^8] _may_ receive again. 5. _He_ who _has_ always himself prayed is better than he who shall accept readily _and_ orders _the work_ again, and is not able to pray it himself, when a fulfilment is tedious to him; when _it_ is I who [^9] receive, I always pray myself better than he who would accept readily _and_ orders again, and it brings on my business to a _closing_ point.’

6\. The priestly man speaks thus: ‘The consideration <span id="p203"><sup><small>[ p. 203 ]</small></sup></span> of stipend is more necessary to arise _with_ me than [^10] other men, owing to the position of religion, not the other portion (<i>s</i>ânŏ) of all religious rites; therefore, it is more authorisedly received _and_ conducted by me when I accept readily and again intrust _the work_; but I direct so that they pray thoroughly, and it brings on much business to its _closing_ point; moreover, _if_ I seize upon it, even then I should be authorised, for this is the stipend of religion.’

7\. Should they seize this that is authorisedly theirs, or not? _And_ is _it_ the custom of a man who is frequently ordering all the religious rites to reduce his gift for the ceremonial, or not?

8\. Order _some one_ to decide for us clearly, when they do not dispute the gift _for_ the ceremonial, or _when_ they do dispute _it_, how is then its great advantage; _and_ the harmfulness that exists therein, in many ways _and_ many modes, when they give an insufficient gift for the ceremonial. 9. Is the property which is given up as a gift for the ceremonial—so long as it thus becomes the remuneration which _one_ gives to a receiver of remuneration (mozdô-bar)—that property which they can seize? 10. And is the work which is done, _or_ deputed, and its great advantage, more than they would perform when, in the period of the evil millenniums [^11], they diminish the gift for the ceremonial; _and_ in how many modes <span id="p204"><sup><small>[ p. 204 ]</small></sup></span> does its harm then proceed therefrom? 11. Of whom are all the religious rites always more authorisedly ordered; of that priestly man, or of that disciple? 12. _For_ what reason, also, is it proper to diminish the gift for all the religious rites of him who is a priestly man, or to give _it_ in excess? 13. When they do not diminish the gift for the ceremonial, and _it_ is given in excess, in what manner does its great advantage then arise therefrom; _and_ why _and_ through what source (bêkh) is it possible _for_ advantage to arise therefrom? 14. When they diminish the gift what harm to it (the ceremonial) is then possible to arise therefrom, _and_ how is _it_ better when they give the gift for the ceremonial?

15\. For when the family householders, with those of the good religion of Irân, are early (pê<i>s</i>) _with_ every single _celebration of_ all the religious rites with holy-water, in the land of Pârs, unless they are in distress, their gift is then 400 dirhams [^12]; and we have given more than this, _even_ 450 dirhams [^13], for it. 16. And now should it be needful, when we diminish anything from the 400 dirhams, or from the 450 [^14] dirhams, of their gift, they would then not accept _it_ from us, _and_ they speak thus: ‘For 400 dirhams, or _at_ least for 350 dirhams [^15]; nothing less do we <span id="p205"><sup><small>[ p. 205 ]</small></sup></span> accept.’ 17. _But_ there are needy _men_ [^16] who always come to us _and_ speak thus: ‘For 350 dirhams we will twice conduct all the religious rites with holy-water [^17], as you have always ordered us before for 400 dirhams; order _it_ only of us, _for_ shouldst thou have _it_ managed by priestly men, they always say that they should always perform a curtailment (kâstârîh) of the religious rites and ceremonies of the sacred beings, _and_ that all the religious rites are not authorisedly ordered except of them.’

18\. Although a priest (aêrpatŏ) who becomes a ruler of the ceremonial should be doubly a decider, yet order _some one_ to explain to us clearly concerning these questions, as asked by us.

19\. The reply is this, that the _man_ of the good religion who intended to order all the religious rites is he whose desire is goodness, and he should be a decider of questions about it.

20\. _As to_ the priest who spoke thus:--‘Thou shouldst order _it_ of me for 350 [^18] dirhams, as you have always given before your business _was arranged_; _and_ it becomes your own non-religious share of the duty, to be authorisedly given, because you have proceeded with the alleged demeanour of the country, _and_ for the purpose of intercession; and all the <span id="p206"><sup><small>[ p. 206 ]</small></sup></span> religious rites with holy-water are such as they solemnize repeatedly (pavan dôr), among which there are many in which [^19] I _act_ and _am_ very well performing’—the gift of 350 dirhams is then not excessive remuneration for him.

21\. _As to_ the disciple who spoke thus:--‘For 350 dirhams I will _twice_ [^20] conduct all the religious rites in the land [^21] of Pârs’—such of them as they then conduct repeatedly are not many in the aggregate (<i>k</i>înakŏ), and they certainly damage his (the man's) property, and all the religious rites of fire, through that deficiency. 22. And they would accept it on this account, that through a love of righteousness they might cause an advantage (khan<i>g</i>înakŏ) unto all those religious rites by their own inferior eminence [^22]. 23. And he extends _and_ impels the ceremonial of the sacred beings into much progress who promotes it through that eminence which is owing to his own wealth, _and_ which is thus more possessed of a share (bôn) of the ceremonial of the sacred beings and of the good work of praise—except, indeed, a like good work of praise of his—when they shall cause that manifestation of eminence [^23]. 24. So that the orderer of the good work understands that that which is diminished by him [^24] is the eminence <span id="p207"><sup><small>[ p. 207 ]</small></sup></span> of the disciple, which his own wealth _has_ to order for those who are not able to give wealth which is their own property for it; _and_ he makes no curtailment (ban<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) of those scanty remunerations.

25\. And if that disciple should accept as remuneration less than is the custom _for_ all the religious rites, _the orderer_ is not undiminished in wealth [^25], for the reason that the good effect owing to the advantage of holy-water is such as _when_ they conduct _them_ repeatedly, unless it be necessary to conduct _them_ in a manner as _if_ unpaid (pavan aga<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>). 26. That curtailment of the good effect is not afterwards demandable (pasîn-sakhunîkŏ), if it _has_ to be accepted by him; _and_ if that acceptance of less remuneration by him be an opposing of him to the malice and ill-temper (vushâî) of the priests, this also is not _the way_ that they should cause progress as regards their own _business_.

27\. And the proximity (nazdîh) of a master of the house [^26] _who_ keeps away from all the religious rites requested _and_ accepted—more particularly when the accepter accepts all the religious rites of the requester for that remuneration—is itself necessary; he may not be of a religious disposition, but it is yet requisite _for him_ to be where this is requested <span id="p208"><sup><small>[ p. 208 ]</small></sup></span> and accepted for that scanty remuneration of his, owing to the extent and impetus of _his_ share of the duty.

28\. Moreover, it is perceived by us in Pârs _that_ they who would accept the work for half the remuneration which was requisite as profit for it formerly would seize the remuneration. 29. And the reason of it is this:—The peasants relied upon the corn of the field (khânŏ) _which_ has not come, _and they_ said: ‘We are hurried; we never obtain _anything_ even on a single one of various debts, and by this payment we _shall_ save _our_ lives for the time; so we calculate that whatever we seize in the manner of a debt or two, when the corn arrives _and_ we sell the corn, we _shall_ make _as_ profit on that business [^27];’—and it seemed to me very desirable _for_ such a man.

30\. If, also, they should approve that scanty remuneration of that disciple, it is an injury of all the religious rites, of which the forgivers  [^28] _have_ to cast the consideration of the unequally-shared advantage out of the body [^29]. 31. All the religious rites ordered of him who is a better performer, owing to not diminishing the proper remuneration, _having_ proceeded unaltered, the remuneration of righteousness _one_ does not approve is important as regards such as they solemnize and conduct in the period [^30]. <span id="p209"><sup><small>[ p. 209 ]</small></sup></span> 32\. Since, for the 350 dirhams, all the religious rites which they conduct once with holy-water are, it is affirmed, all the religious rites caused to be conducted twice with holy-water in that same place _and with_ the same good effect, it is more important to order of _them_ who shall allow all the religious rites twice; for, with as much wealth, as much efficiency, and as much good effect, more ceremonial is good.

33\. The worthiness of the disciple, which is owing to himself, is the preparation; _and_ the priest is worthy, of whose performance in the religion _you have_ spoken [^31]; therefore, supreme worthiness is unattainable by either of them; so it is more significant when the disciple is the preparer, _and_ the priest, _as_ director, becomes a demander of good effect; both strive for good progress, _and_ through many kinds of participation they may be worthy. 34. And both of them, praising together—whereby the participation is brought _to_ an end—may authorisedly seize [^32]; but that worthiness of theirs is owing to the duty and the praise therein—this _one_ in preparing, _and_ this _one_ in superintendence (a<i>v</i>ar-ma<i>d</i>îh) of the recital—_and_ the after discourse and petitioning, _and_ other good done.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (201:3) This was the name of one of the first thirty sections of the Hûspârûm Nask (see Chap. LXI, 3), and a portion of it, containing the Pahlavi commentary (or Zand) of three chapters, with many Avesta quotations, is still extant.

[^2]: (201:4) The word <i>g</i>û<i>g</i>anŏ, ‘dirham,’ is here omitted, but occurs in §§ 16, 20. The sum of 350 dirhams would be about 122½ rûpîs (see Chap. LII, 1 n).

[^3]: (201:5) That is, those who are still learning their priestly duties (see Chap. XLV).

[^4]: (202:1) It being far easier to learn the Avesta by heart than to understand its meaning by aid of the Pahlavi commentary; a competent knowledge of the latter being sought only by advanced disciples, and rarely attained by any but the most learned priests.

[^5]: (202:2) Reading pavan bûm-i Pârs, as in § 15; K35 has here pavan bûn-frâs, ‘for opening the beginning,’ which might be understood to refer to the preliminary ceremonies for preparing. the ceremonial apparatus, if the phrase were not otherwise written elsewhere. In § 21 K35 has pavan bûn-î Pârs.

[^6]: (202:3) K35 omits the last letter of valman.

[^7]: (202:4) Or, it may be ‘to the precincts.’

[^8]: (202:5) Literally ‘I.’

[^9]: (202:6) Reading li mûn, instead of lanman, ‘we.’

[^10]: (203:1) Reading li min, instead of the imperfect word lanm.

[^11]: (203:2) Of the twelve millenniums of time, mentioned in Chap. XXXVII, 11 n, the most evil one is said to have been that in which the author lived, the millennium of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar (about A.D. 600-1600 according to the chronology of Bund. and Byt.), for ‘mankind become most perplexed in that perplexing time’ (see Byt, II, 62, 63), a period of great tribulation for the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers.

[^12]: (204:1) About 140 rûpîs (see Chap. LII, 1 n). M14 has 300 dirhams.

[^13]: (204:2) About 157½ rûpîs. M14 has 350 dirhams. The actual value of all these sums depends upon the cost of the necessaries of life in Pârs in the ninth century.

[^14]: (204:3) M14 has ‘350.’

[^15]: (204:4) About 122½ rûpîs. K35 has ângûn, ‘so,’ instead of <i>g</i>û<i>g</i>anŏ, ‘dirham’ (the two words being nearly alike in Pahl. letters); this would alter the phrase as follows:--‘or less; as to 350, so paltry a thing we do not accept.’

[^16]: (205:1) The disciples, who are represented as applicants for employment.

[^17]: (205:2) That is, in the most solemn manner, and with all appliances. It appears from Chap. LXXXVIII, 9, that the religious rites without holy-water were then performed for 120 to 150 dirhams, or little more than one-third the fee demanded for those with holy-water; whereas the merit of some rites with holy-water is said to be a hundred times as great as that of the same rites without holy-water (see Sls. XVI, 6).

[^18]: (205:3) M14 has ‘400’ here, but see § 2.

[^19]: (206:1) Reading mûn, ‘which,’ instead of amat, ‘when’ (see Chap. LXII, 4 n).

[^20]: (206:2) The cipher ‘2’ is omitted in the Pahl. text here, but see §§ 3, 17.

[^21]: (206:3) K35 has bûn, instead of bûm (see § 3).

[^22]: (206:4) Or, it may be ‘by the eminence of their own wealth,’ as air, ‘inferior,’ and khêl, ‘wealth, property,’ are alike in Pahlavi; but neither reading is quite satisfactory here.

[^23]: (206:5) By a proper disbursement of wealth.

[^24]: (206:6) When he diminishes his payment.

[^25]: (207:1) M14 has ‘_it_ is not eminence in wealth;’ but the meaning is evidently that there is no real saving when the expenditure is reduced, because the good effect of the rites is also diminished when they are insufficiently paid for.

[^26]: (207:2) Or, khânŏpânŏ may mean ‘a keeper of the sacred table,’ or low stone platform on which the ceremonial vessels are placed, which is often called khân. In either case the orderer of the ceremony is meant, and the author evidently contemplates the probability of the order being given as a mere formal matter of duty, without any really religious feeling.

[^27]: (208:1) This parable justifies the taking of religious stipends by force, in cases of necessity, by a practical appeal to the sympathies of the enquirers; but it really evades the question proposed in § 7, which refers to seizures not justified by necessity.

[^28]: (208:2) Probably the priests who appoint atonements for sins confessed and renounced (see Sls. VIII, I, 2, 5, 6).

[^29]: (208:3) Of those who have obtained a disproportionate share of the profit of the good works by not paying properly for them.

[^30]: (208:4) There are several doubtful points in the construction of this section.

[^31]: (209:1) See § 1.

[^32]: (209:2) Probably the remuneration, if it be withheld; provided always they do their duty thoroughly, as mentioned in the concluding clause.
