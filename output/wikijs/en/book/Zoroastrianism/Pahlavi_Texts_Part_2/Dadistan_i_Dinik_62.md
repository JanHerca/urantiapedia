## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXII.

1\. _As to_ the sixty-first question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: How stand the shares in the inheritance (mîrâtŏ) of property among those of the good religion, and how is it necessary for them to stand therein?

2\. The reply is this, that in the possession of wealth the wealth reaches higher _or_ lower, just like water when it goes in a stream on a declivity, but when the passage shall be closed at the bottom it goes back on the running water (pûy-â<i>v</i>ŏ), _and_ then it does not go to its after-_course_ [^1]. <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> 3\. When there is nothing _otherwise_ in the will and private [^2], property _goes_ to a wife _or_ daughter [^3] who is privileged; if _one_ gives her anything by will then she does not obtain the share (dâ<i>s</i>) _pertaining_ to her [^4]. 4. Whenever [^5] a share for a son is not provided by it, every one _has_ so much and the wife who may be a privileged _one has_ twice as much; and the share of that _one_ of the sons [^6], _or_ even the wife of a son, who is blind in both eyes, or crippled [^7] in both feet, or maimed in both his hands, is twice as much as that _of one_ who is sound.

5\. And _it_ is needful _that_ he who was in the father's guardianship _shall_ remain in guardianship, as when a father or mother is decrepit and causing awe (<i>k</i>agarîn), or _of_ a nurture different from that of the guardian [^8]\--or a child of his brother or sister, or a father, or _one_ [^9] without nurture apart from him, is <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> without a guardian--the ready guardianship of a capable man, and the shelter _and_ nourishment _that_ have become inadequate [^10] are as indispensably forth_coming_ [^11] from the possessors of wealth, of those who _have_ taken the property, as that _taking_ was indispensable [^12].

6\. If _there_ be no son of that _man_, but there be a daughter or wife of his, and if _some_ of the _affairs_ [^13] of the man are such as render a woman not suitable for the guardianship, it is necessary to appoint a family guardian; if there be, moreover, no wife _or_ daughter of his it is necessary to appoint an adopted son. 7. This--that is, when it is necessary to appoint a family guardian _and_ who is the fittest, _and_ when it is necessary to appoint an adopted son _and_ which is the fittest--is written in the chapters _on_ the question [^14].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (194:2) This metaphor seems to mean that property, like water, always p. 195 descends until it meets with an obstruction to its downward progress in the shape of the nearest descendants, but, when once in their possession, it can again ascend (like the dammed stream) for the support of the survivors of an older generation (see § 5).

[^2]: (195:1) Or, it may be ‘in the provisions (vûyagân) of the will;’ or, by omitting two strokes, we have simply ‘otherwise (hân) in the will.’

[^3]: (195:2) That is, they have a share of the property when there are other next of kin. M14 adds, ‘and they should provide a living son as father and husband unless privileged,’ referring to the necessity of adoption when there is no son and the wife is not a privileged one.

[^4]: (195:3) It being assumed that the will provides as much as is intended for any one whom it mentions.

[^5]: (195:4) Reading amat, ‘when,’ instead of mûn, 'who; which words are often confounded because their Pâz. equivalents are nearly identical.

[^6]: (195:5) M14 has ‘daughters.’

[^7]: (195:6) Armê<i>s</i>t probably means literally ‘most immovable.’

[^8]: (195:7) M14 omits this last clause.

[^9]: (195:8) M14 has ‘mother.’

[^10]: (196:1) Literally ‘not issuing.’

[^11]: (196:2) M14 has ‘are thus forth_coming_’

[^12]: (196:3) M14 has ‘or _have_ become indispensable to it.’

[^13]: (196:4) Or, it may be ‘_dependents_;’ the text is merely va hatŏ min zak-î gab<i>r</i>â.

[^14]: (196:5) See Chaps. LVI-LIX.
