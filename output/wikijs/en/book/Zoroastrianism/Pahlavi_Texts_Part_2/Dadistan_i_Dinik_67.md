## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXVII.

1\. _As to_ the sixty-sixth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: What is this appearance [^1] which is girded on the sky?

2\. The reply is this, that _it is_ a mingling of the brilliance of the sun with mist and cloud that is seen, of which _it_ is _at_ all times and seasons, moreover, a characteristic appearance, whereby _it has_ become their sign above from spiritual to earthly beings.

3\. That which is earthly is the water above to which its brilliance is acceptable; and the many brilliant colours (gunakân) which are formed from that much mingling [^2] of brilliance and water, and are depicted (mânâkî-aîtŏ), are the one portion for appearing [^3].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (210:1) Reading dî<i>d</i>anŏîh; but the word can also be read sa<i>d</i>\-vanîh, which might stand for sa<i>d</i>\-gûnîh,‘ a hundred-coloured existence,’ a possible term for the rainbow, but the Persian dictionaries give no nearer term than sadkas, or sadkês.

[^2]: (210:2) M14 has ‘that mingling of many portions and few portions.’

[^3]: (210:3) Reading dî<i>d</i>anŏkŏ; but it can also be read sa<i>d</i>\-vanakŏ, a similar alternative to that in § 1.
