## EPISTLE II. TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER VII.

1\. A well-reflecting _person_, moreover, is able to understand that which is written by me, in private, in writing unto the good _people_ of Sîrkân, as perhaps a legitimate copy [^5] of a writing of that kind from <span id="p351"><sup><small>[ p. 351 ]</small></sup></span> me _may be_ near you; and it was like the production of some one for the tearing and rending of his own limbs, and for the purpose of bringing on that remedy--the burning, torturing medicine that is religious [^1]\--whose purpose is to remain _away_ from the steadfast while _abiding_ by the commands of religion. 2. This _same_ epistle [^2], which _was_ one of very great incompleteness, and one as _it were_ thinking very severely, _was_ similar to the decision (azad [^3]) _to_ which I _have_ come on the same subject, _which is_ written _of_ below and again; and accompanying this epistle _was_ a man of my own with a further epistle [^4]. 3. I am discharging (vi<i>g</i>ârakŏ) my own _duty_ as regards it [^5], where I so arrange affairs of every kind which _it_ is possible for me to complete _for_ a _period_ of three months [^6], _and_ come myself to _where_ you are, and that mastery (<i>k</i>îrîh) which is prepared is again arranged when it is wanted by them [^7].

4\. You _have_ already become a reserver (khamo-<i>s</i>î<i>d</i>âr) and rapid preparer of the adaptation of words in which cogency _exists_, and _have_ clearly explained <span id="p352"><sup><small>[ p. 352 ]</small></sup></span> as much as is in sight about the reason of altering that decree, concerning which your opinion is written with great judiciousness. 5. But _as to_ the understanding which prompted you to write properly, and not to alter the rites _and_ purifications of the Avesta, and about the duty of purifying the purifiers [^1], such as _has_ entered into the practice of the good, the propriety is declared in the teaching of the high-priests; _and_ to do _it_ better, so far as is possible, is to strive forwards in goodness.

6\. Also, as regards changing the law of the fifteen times _washing_ [^2], just as _it is_ for Irân _in_ which purifiers are to be found, it is ordered for _places_ to be found without purifiers; _and it is_ in the countries of Irân that the order is given regarding purifiers not thus appointed for the work.
