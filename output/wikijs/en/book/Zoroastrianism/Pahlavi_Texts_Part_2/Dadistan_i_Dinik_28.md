## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER XXVIII.

1\. The twenty-seventh question is that which you ask thus: Why and what is _the ceremony of_  <span id="p59"><sup><small>[ p. 59 ]</small></sup></span> the three _nights_ (satûîh), when during three days they order and perform the sacred-cake ceremony (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ drônô) of Srôsh [^1]?

2\. The reply is this, that the life and soul, when from the realm of the spirit of air [^2] they attain unto worldly attire, and have passed into its pain and misfortune, are more sensitive (nâ<i>z</i>ûktar); owing to their nurture, birth, _and_ mission, protection and defence are more desirable and more suitable for the discreet (hû-<i>k</i>îragânîktar); and milk food, and renewed (navagûnak) and constant attention to the fire are requisite  [^3]. 3. So also when they are ousted from bodily existence, and pain and the eradication of life have come upon them, _they_ are _in_ like manner more sensitive, and sending them protection and defence from spirits _and_ worldly existences is more desirable. 4. And on account of their spiritual character the offering (firî<i>s</i>ti<i>s</i>nŏ) of gifts _for_ the angels, fit for the ritual of a spirit (maînôk nîrangîk), is more presentable; and also a fire newly tended (nôgônd) is that which is more the custom in the _sacred_ ceremony (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ).

5\. _For_ the same reason _in_ the three days when in connection with the soul the _sacred_ ceremony, the burning of fire, _its_ cleanly clearance (gôndi<i>s</i>nŏ), <span id="p60"><sup><small>[ p. 60 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ other religious _and_ ritualistic defence, feeding on milk _and_ eating with a spoon [^4] are ordered, because—as the _sacred_ ceremony, the defence and protection of the worldly existences, is, by order of the creator, the business of Srôsh the righteous [^5], and _he_ is also one of _those_ taking the account in the three _nights_ [^6]\—Srôsh the righteous gives the soul, _for_ three days and nights, the place of the spirit of air in the world, and protection. 6. And because of the protectiveness of Srôsh, and _that one_ is assisted likewise by Srôsh's taking the account, and for that purpose, are the manifest reasons for performing _and_ ordering the ceremony of Srôsh _for_ three days and nights [^7].

7\. And the fourth day the ordering and performing the ceremony of the righteous guardian spirit (ar<i>d</i>âî fravar<i>d</i>ŏ) [^8] are _for_ the same soul and the remaining righteous guardian spirits of those who are _and_ were _and will_ be, from Gâyômar<i>d</i> the propitious to Sôshâns the triumphant [^9].
