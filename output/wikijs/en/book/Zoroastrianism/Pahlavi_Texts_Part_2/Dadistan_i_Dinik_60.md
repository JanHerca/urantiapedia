## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LX.

1\. _As to_ the fifty-ninth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: What is the sin owing to not appointing _an adopted son?_ 

2\. The reply is this, that _for the man_ himself _it_ is allowable when he gives up all the property in <span id="p193"><sup><small>[ p. 193 ]</small></sup></span> righteous gifts, _and_ when he has no property they should not provide an adopted-sonship for him, _and_ his relations are innocent as regards it. 3. But should they recognise him who has the adopted-sonship of the deceased, or has accepted the position of his adopted-sonship [^1], _or_ should they have seized the property for the adopted-sonship _in order_ to appoint an acting adopted son (satôrgar), _and_ he conducts the adopted-sonship, and throws away _both_ the portion (bôn) provided for disbursement (vishôpŏ) and the entirety, and quite destroys the property, and thoroughly ruins the adopted-sonship, though, on account of not restraining him, it is said _to be_ a sin worthy of death for _every_ single dirham, it is not said _they are_ killed outright [^2].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (193:1) M14 has ‘or any one who has accepted the adoption as an adoption.’

[^2]: (193:2) The meaning appears to be that, though, owing to their misplaced confidence and neglect, they have been guilty of many mortal sins they are not liable to capital punishment. It is evident that the writer had no apprehension that any property would lie neglected through want of administration, but that he had considerable doubts of the prudence and honesty of administrators.
