## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LII.

1\. _As to_ the fifty-first question _and_ reply, that _which_ you ask is thus: _There is_ a man who hands over a dirham [^2] as regards five bushels (kafî<i>z</i>) of <span id="p181"><sup><small>[ p. 181 ]</small></sup></span> wheat, thus: ‘I give this to thee as an instalment (bôn-ae) [^1] of five bushels of wheat at the end of a month;’ and during the month, _and_ at _its_ end, those five bushels of wheat become five _times_ the price; would they authorisedly seize the five bushels of wheat _when_ winnowed (pêkhtŏ ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>ŏ) by him, through that instalment which he handed over, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that when they who shall take his dirham _have_ to intrust the five bushels of wheat, unsuspiciously _and_ by their own will, _to him_ to winnow, even so as _they_ are advisedly _and_ unsuspiciously winnowed by him they should take _them_ just as winnowed; _this_ is the decision authorisedly given. 3. But when _it_ is winnowed by him on account of very grievous necessity for payment, _it_ is more suitable for the soul to beg the giver of the money, who is the purchasing payer [^2], for _some_ of that excess of undivided (apâr) profit. 4. For _he has_ to consider the profit of _his_ successors as among the profit of money on the spot [^3]\--_when_ more than <span id="p182"><sup><small>[ p. 182 ]</small></sup></span> such instalment demanded--_and_ not as a fresh carrying off of a gift [^1].

## Footnotes

[^2]: (180:2) The dirham (δραχμή) is a weight, and also a silver coin of that weight, but its amount is rather uncertain. According to the Pers. MS. M5 (fol. 55), written A.D. 1723, the proper dowry for a ‘privileged’ wife is 2000 dirhams of white-silver, or 2300 rûpîs, and 2 dirhams of red gold, or 2¼ tolas. The rûpîs formerly current in Gu<i>g</i>arât were less in value than the present Indian coinage, but the tola, which is the weight of the present rûpî, was probably much the same as it is now, or 180 grains; the statement in M5 is, therefore, equivalent to saying that the dirham contained 202 grains of pure silver. This is so much more than the amount deducible from other authorities that it might be supposed that the stîr (στατήρ) or tetradrachm was meant, if it were not confirmed, to some extent, by the Pers. Rivâyats, which state the dowry at 2000 dirhams of pure white silver and 2 dînârs of red gold of the Nîshâpûr currency; the dînâr being a gold coin containing a dirham weight of pure p. 181 gold. It is safer, however, to rely upon the average weight of the Sasanian dirham coins, which, according to Dr. Mordtmann‘s statement in ZDMG. vol. xii, pp. 44, 45, is about 63 grains, or 5 3/5 annas’ worth of silver; so that the stîr would be 252 grains or 22 3/5 annas. But the actual value of such coins of former times can be ascertained only from the quantity of corn! or other well-defined necessary of life, which they would purchase.

[^1]: (181:1) K35 has vaban twice in this sentence, but bôn in § 4. M14 alters this word and others, so as to make the chapter unintelligible. The money is supposed to be given merely as a deposit, in acknowledgment of a bargain to be carried out after the corn is ready for delivery.

[^2]: (181:2) Reading zednunand dûkhtâr, but, perhaps, this is a corruption of zednûnînî<i>d</i>âr, ‘a causer of purchase, a broker.’

[^3]: (181:3) That is, ‘ready money.’

[^1]: (182:1) That is, having made a bargain, he is not to be aggrieved at any unexpected excess of profit made in good faith by the other parties to the bargain; a rather high standard of commercial morality.
