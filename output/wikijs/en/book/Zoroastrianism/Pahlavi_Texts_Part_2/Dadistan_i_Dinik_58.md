## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LVIII.

1\. The fifty-seventh question is that which you ask thus: How many kinds of family guardianship and adoption are _there?_

2\. The reply is this, that it is said _there_ are three kinds, which are the existent, the provided, and the appointed. 3. An adopted son who is existent is such as a wife who may be privileged, _or_ an only daughter is a kind of adopted son owing to confidence in herself, such as happens when there is no wife, _and_ a daughter for whom there is no husband, _and_ none is provided, is the one _that_ has remained.

4\. An adopted son _who_ is provided is such _as_ a son that is acknowledged, who is accepted by one's self [^1], and _free_ from _being_ appointed, or _from_ necessity [^2].

5\. And an adopted son who is appointed is he who is to be appointed among the relations who are suitable for adoption--and are nearest to him who is to be appointed _as_ adopted son--and the ministers (pa<i>d</i>ân) of religion, _and_ he performs the duty of <span id="p192"><sup><small>[ p. 192 ]</small></sup></span> family guardianship [^3]; he who is the appointed _one_ is he who is appointed by the men _who are_ the nearest relations (nabânazdi<i>s</i>tânŏ) on account of proximity.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (191:1) That is, adopted during the man's lifetime.

[^2]: (191:2) Reading ayûf nîyâ<i>z</i>ŏ, but it may be ayûfŏ êyâ<i>v</i>ŏ, ‘or _from_ discovery.’

[^3]: (192:1) M14 has ‘an existent family guardianship is _in_ the son of him appointed, and a provided _one_ is that when he himself performs the duty in the guardianship;’ but the phrase interpolated is hardly grammatical.
