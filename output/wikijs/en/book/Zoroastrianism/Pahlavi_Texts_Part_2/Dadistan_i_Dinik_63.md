## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXIII.

1\. The sixty-second question is that which you ask thus: Would they authorisedly carry off any property whatever from foreigners and infidels, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that wealth and property and anything that foreigners (an-aîrânŏ) possess and is carried off by them from the good with violence, _and which through_ obstinacy they do not give back <span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span> when it is proper, it is well allowable in _that_ case that they should seize from the foreigners. 3. So long as _it_ is the lawful order of the procurator of its owners [^1] _it_ is allowable for a just decider to consider properly, and to demand authoritatively the sending of interest (sû<i>d</i>ŏ) thereon for himself. 4. But _if_ they proceed in their obstinacy _he_ is sent to come _up_ with them in obstinacy, not to dissemble with them [^2].

5\. _It is_ the custom to give an infidel (ak-dînô), who is not a foreigner, food, clothing, _and_ medicine, when his renunciation (vâ<i>z</i>) has come, for keeping away matters (<i>k</i>isânŏ) of death and sickness owing to hunger _and_ thirst, cold and heat; but wealth, horses, accoutrements, wine, _and_ land are not given authorisedly, it is said, unto foreigners _and_ idolators [^3].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (197:1) Reading vad zak amata<i>s</i> khû<i>d</i>âyân ayâ<i>v</i>î-aîtâr farmân-î dâ<i>d</i>îk. The form of ayâ<i>v</i>î-aîtâr has not yet been met with elsewhere, but it seems to mean ‘one who holds the obtainment,’ though whether as agent or officer of justice is uncertain.

[^2]: (197:2) M14 has merely ‘but should they proceed in their obstinacy, to come with them is not to dissemble.’

[^3]: (197:3) Literally ‘demon-worshippers.’
