## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER IX.

1\. The eighth question is that which you ask thus: Of him who, out of his _own_ wealth, himself directed others thus: ‘Let them act advantageously (khan<i>g</i>înakŏ) for my soul,’ is it so that what others may do for him out of that wealth _and that_ done by his own toil are very different, one from the other, or not? <span id="p29"><sup><small>[ p. 29 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. The reply is this, that _they_ are very different, one from the other; for that which he orders out of his own wealth is more effectual than that which others may do for him without order. 3. And among the kinds of good work, that is more effectual which _one_ practises himself and with his own toil; then that _which one_ sets going out of whatever is his own by his own order, regarding which he [^1] afterwards bequeaths _and_ orders out of his own _property and_ it comes into progress; and, lastly, that which others may do for him.

4\. Since thus his own _and_ that which is his by design, when any one manages for him and in his life_time_, aggrandize his position then, _and his_ soul is preserved, when he manages for him thereafter the enjoyment then reaches unto his soul. 5. When not consenting as to the good work, and _it is_ not his by design, even though others may do _it_ for him it does not then come into his possession.
