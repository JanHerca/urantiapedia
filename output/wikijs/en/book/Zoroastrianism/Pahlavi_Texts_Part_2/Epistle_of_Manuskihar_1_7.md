## EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ<i>S</i><i>K</i>ÎHAR. EPISTLE I. CHAPTER VII.

1\. And _as to_ that which is written [^1], that ‘in the teaching of Afarg _it_ is thus declared, that “for every single person, at the least [^2], one cup of water _and_  <span id="p305"><sup><small>[ p. 305 ]</small></sup></span> one cup of bull’s urine, which are well alike (vêhmâl) [^3], are requisite;” _and in_ the same manner it is said in the teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, that “the water and bull‘s urine, when it is possible, are all to be thoroughly consecrated; when not--and, at the lowest, one cup of water and one cup of bull’s urine, which are well alike, for every single person--_they_ are to be set down _in_ that place, and are afterwards to be mingled together [^4].” 2. And since two teachings have so stated, are _we_ to perform the operation more preservatively [^5] and according to a more correct opinion than this?'

3\. Also, ‘a correct apportionment is not understood by us, and clear reasons _have_ not come to _our_ knowledge that a less measure of the thing is proper.’ [^6]. But I well imagine (hû-minam) this. is not the operation of the _purifying_ cup (tâ<i>s</i>tîkŏ), where a less thing is not proper, because the information with which they have existed--owing to that information of theirs, of which a former high-priest and deliberator _was_ the communicator--is that which _was_ heard by me, that there are _some_ who, for the sake of diminishing the measure _of_ water _and_ bull‘s urine, speak of this apportionment thus: ’Vî<i>k</i>ithr<i>e</i><i>k</i>i<i>d</i>‘, in everything the operation <span id="p306"><sup><small>[ p. 306 ]</small></sup></span> which accomplishes this, that is, when _there is_ as much as is discernible from his body [^7], is proper.’ 5. And the saying is not perceived by me _as_ a correct apportioning, because the judgment of the greatly-learned leader of those of the good religion, the glorified Yûdân-Yim [^8], and of other deliberators, the opinion of good thinkers, was thus, that that saying is spoken about that of which the measure is not declared as the least by the high-priests' teaching of revelation. 6. Finally, when it is really of the same origin _and_ suitable, then less than the least of that, of which the measure is declared as the least, is not proper, if, owing to much evidence in the teaching which has mentioned _it_ as suitable, _it be_ more of a blessing, and the operation performed thereby _be_ more legitimate; because that teaching is for confessing that the statements of high-priests are most evidence of the practice.

7\. This is that which is equally perpetual: it is very important _for_ the purifiers to keep the intellect of life in operation, _and for_ the good to become mentally a powerful giver of aid to them; and now, too, a purifier is ordered to keep in use his own most universal equal measure. 8. That which is perceived by me, and _has_ come to my knowledge, more particularly when washed by myself, is the keeping in use an equal measure [^9]. 9. And even if there be a purifier who does not completely keep in use the <span id="p307"><sup><small>[ p. 307 ]</small></sup></span> consecrated water and bull's urine, still then _it_ is not worse than when it does not really arise _from_ the same origin [^10], and its religious rite also does not take place.

10\. Also the words of both the solemnization of the Vendidâ<i>d</i> and the recitation of the Avesta are likewise to be uttered by him; because [^11] ‘Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _about_ it thus: "How _shall_ I purify [^12] where he does not attain unto the Airy<i>e</i>mâ [^13]\--there are _some_ who say _where_ everything is anusô (’discontented') [^14]? 11. How as to the fire, how as to the water, how as to the earth, how as to animals, how as to plants, how as to the righteous man, how as to the righteous woman, how as to the stars, how as to the moon, how as to the sun, how as to the endless light, how as to the independent light [^15], how as to all the prosperity, created by <span id="p308"><sup><small>[ p. 308 ]</small></sup></span> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^16], which is a manifestation of righteousness?" 12. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to him thus: "Thou shalt chant the purification _liturgy_, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t!--that is, fully solemnize a Vendidâ<i>d</i> _service_\--then he becomes purified, &c.,"' as mentioned by me _above_ [^17]. 13. Where they do not make _them_ solemnize a Vendidâ<i>d</i> so that they keep in operation that which is written of it as a rite, this does not drive _pollution_ from any _one_; and then, too, they should abandon the commands of a decree of leaders who are not over _them_ [^18].

14\. Keep the Bareshnûm _ceremony_ [^19] in operation, so that the consecrated water and bull's urine are in the proportion _which_ is taught by the high-priests of the religion, unless a scarcity occurs as regards these. 15. Then _together_ with it, also, this is _to be observed_, that what is mentioned in two teachings is certainly more correct; afterwards, too, where a possibility for it is not obtained by them, _there_ is _what_ is mentioned as suitable by one teaching, and I do not decide _that it_ is not an expediency.

16\. And _as to_ that, also, _which_ is written concerning the three hundred pebbles [^20] that, sprinkled <span id="p309"><sup><small>[ p. 309 ]</small></sup></span> in _ceremonial_ ablution (pâ<i>d</i>yâ<i>v</i>ŏ), are cast into (va<i>l</i>) the bull's urine and water, that is taught even _in_ the same manner; the _inward_ prayer (vâ<i>g</i>ŏ) [^21], even for when _one_ does not cast _them_, is in the existing teaching, which is proper. 17. Then, too, on account of the cheapness [^22] and harmlessness of the pebbles the purifiers are less curtailing as to them, _and_ to drink the thing so is well-curative in performance. 18. In the existing teaching of imperfect purifiers it should be very advantageous to maintain it as easy; moreover, it is not said of it _that it_ is not suitable, and in the teaching of Afarg it is said that it is proper.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (304:4) In the epistle to which he is replying.

[^2]: (304:5) The words pavan kâmîstîh, both here and in §§ 5, 6, would be better translated as ‘a desideratum, or desired quantity;’ but in p. 305 Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>c</i> the phrase is pavan kamistîh, which can mean only ‘at the minimum, or least.’

[^3]: (305:1) In Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>c</i>, where this statement occurs, the first letter of this word is omitted, which converts it into shumâr, 'alike: Either word may be correct, but vêh-mâl occurs twice in this section.

[^4]: (305:2) This statement of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh seems no longer extant in the Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i>.

[^5]: (305:3) That is, in a way more delivering from pollution and sin.

[^6]: (305:4) This word, which probably means ‘in whatever is varied,’ was p. 306 evidently the beginning of an Avesta phrase whose Pahlavi translation concludes the sentence. The phrase does not appear to be extant elsewhere.

[^7]: (306:1) That is, just sufficient to wet the body.

[^8]: (306:2) His father (see Chap. III, 10).

[^9]: (306:3) That is, the two liquids should he provided in equal quantities, p. 307 which differs from the present practice, as stated in the Persian Rivâyats; thus, M10, fol. 104 a, mentions 3¼ mans of water and 1¼ man of bull's urine as suitable quantities to be provided. This section is omitted in J, probably by mistake.

[^10]: (307:1) Apparently deprecating the use of mingled liquids derived from various sources.

[^11]: (307:2) The passage quoted here is from Pahl. Vend. XI, 1-6, with a few variations.

[^12]: (307:3) Pahl. Vend. inserts ‘as to the abode.’

[^13]: (307:4) The Airy<i>e</i>mâ (written Airyêmê in the MSS.) is Yas. LIII, which commences with the words ‘â airy<i>e</i>mâ ishyô,’ and is the last of the Gâtha spells mentioned, in Vend. X, 22, as having to be recited four times in order to exorcise the fiend. The meaning of the question in the text, therefore, is: how is the purification to be effected when all the spells are not recited?

[^14]: (307:5) Referring to Vend. IX, 161--163 (see Chap. IV, 3).

[^15]: (307:6) This clause is omitted in Pahl. Vend., being merely a repetition of the preceding one, the Av. anaghra rao<i>k</i><i>a</i>u being first translated by asarag rôshanŏîh, and then partially transliterated by p. 308 anagrag rŏshanŏ. As sar means ‘head, end’ in Pahlavi (hardly ever ‘beginning’), the only meaning common to the two terms asarag and anagrag seems to be ‘without a head or superior, independent,’ that is, in this case, independent of the light of other luminaries.

[^16]: (308:1) K35 has ‘righteousness, created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>,’ but this is evidently a mistake, as ‘righteousness’ does not translate the original Av. vohû.

[^17]: (308:2) That is, as to the fire, &c. mentioned in § 11.

[^18]: (308:3) Referring to the heretical decree about which he is writing.

[^19]: (308:4) See App. IV.

[^20]: (308:5) See also Ep. II, iii, 12. The word generally used in these p. 309 epistles is sang, ‘stone,’ but Chap. IX, 6 has sagî<i>k</i>akŏ, and Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>c</i> mentions sag<i>k</i>ak, ‘a pebble,’ as being cast into (dên) the consecrated water and bull‘s urine, without specifying any number. The practice appears not to be mentioned in the Persian Rivâyats, and seems now obsolete; the addition of a small quantity of the ashes of the sacred fire to the bull’s urine, which is tasted at the beginning of the rite, is, however, mentioned in the Rivâyats.

[^21]: (309:1) See Dd. LXXIX, 2. The prayer or grace has to be taken inwardly, that is, murmured, before the drinking mentioned in § 17. According to this text provision seems to have been made for not using the pebbles, by means of a special prayer.

[^22]: (309:2) Or ‘value,’ as ar<i>g</i>ânîh means both.
