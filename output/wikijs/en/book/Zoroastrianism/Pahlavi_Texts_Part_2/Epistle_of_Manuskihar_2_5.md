## EPISTLE II. TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER V.

1\. If this which is said by you be a knowledge that is replete (a<i>v</i>kâr) with advantage, why was it then necessary for you to keep _it_ as _it were_ concealed [^1] from me, when I thus consider that, if a knowledge should be rightly obtained by you, it should then have been needful for you to report unto me on the first rumour [^2] from every _one_ who is well-enlightened (hû-bâm)? 2. If this decree <span id="p344"><sup><small>[ p. 344 ]</small></sup></span> seemed so to you before, between when you have been in Pârs and this _time_ when in Sîrkân, _it was_ not well considered with those acquainted with the religion, the wise _and_ the high-priests, _and_ not even reported. 3. If not conceived by you before, then what learned acquaintance with the religion _was_ acquired by you in Sarakhs [^3] _and_ Shirâ<i>z</i>, about which you are enlightened? 4. And before it was to be well considered amid observation _and_ meditation [^4] what high-priest _was_ obtained by you in Shirâ<i>z</i>, who, when it was well considered with him, in completely securing himself, kept you _away_ from deliberation to be decided with me _and_ other priestly _men_ and high-priests?

5\. If not decided by you in Pârs on account of breaking _away_ from me, that is _as_ though you yourself understand that I _am_ to keep, _in_ my own person, not even in the rank of discipleship unto you, but in that which is like servitude; and my coming [^5], which is on your account, is even an accumulation of harm _and_ distrust (tars) which you _have_ amassed for yourself by _having_ written _and_ acted, _and_ has made _me_ suffer sorrow (vî<i>d</i>varînî<i>d</i>ŏ) in my own person. 6. If it had been shown to me by you _that_ it would be the preservation of the religion, it would then have incited me to accept _it_ steadfastly. 7. If, <span id="p345"><sup><small>[ p. 345 ]</small></sup></span> for the sake of co-operation with me, a lawful decree had been even more privately propagated by you, and if the religious demonstration about it _were_ conservative _and_ correct, it would then have been less vexatious for you to explain _it_ to me than to others who _have_ less acquaintance with the decrees _and_ declaration of revelation; _and_ if a difference had arisen thereon, a correct reply would then have come to you more fully from me. 8. And if you conceive that it is not necessary to demonstrate _it_ to me through the declaration in revelation, that deliverance which it is not necessary to announce is not to be so decreed, even in another place. 9. And, just as even in Pârs, _if it_ were not decreed by you in Sîrkân on that account, when your conception was that they would not accept _it_ from you, it _was_ necessary for you to know that, because it was not possible for you to provide much interval for demonstration.

10\. If _its_ purport _be_ now considered by you, when you are moving as to the writing from Shirâ<i>z</i> [^6]\--which writes fully _of_ your acquirement and interpretation of it, and _of_ a mutilated deliverance [^7]\--the arrangements for iniquity on this subject are many. 11. And one of them is the erroneous writing [^8] which is with me, for you conceive that they would accept from me your _view_, as _it were_ swearing (sôkandîkŏ) that it does not go to the filth accumulated for [^9] <span id="p346"><sup><small>[ p. 346 ]</small></sup></span> Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and does not contend with him; _and that_ the opposition (hamêmalîh) does not strive _for_ a new law, _and_ does not increase the evil of the spirit _and_ the world, since it labours _for_ the hoard of the soul.

12\. And, persistently concealed, that _was_ done by thee, owing to which is the anguish of my life; for _it_ is annoying when a wound of the soul is not actually realised by means of the decree; but if, too, it should be really avoidable, _it_ is then even said _that_ ignorance itself would be regenerative (navazû<i>d</i>ârîhâ), since _it_ is not dubious to me, unless a matured knowledge of creation and some of that even _of_ the angels should be in sight [^10]. 13. Also through their much talking, which is like Vîsari<i>s</i> [^11], and much affliction, which is like the eradication of life, _there_ is a perpetual demonstration then _in_ every place of the country of Irân, where this information _about_ its religion shall arrive, _that_ they then consider thee as an apostate and an enemy of the religion.

14\. And through this eager procedure of yours many troops in the provinces, who _have_ to horse (aspînî<i>d</i>anŏ) themselves, _have_ joined Âtûrŏ-pâ<i>d</i> [^12]; <span id="p347"><sup><small>[ p. 347 ]</small></sup></span> for, inasmuch as those most mounted on horses [^13] are the washers [^14] _of_ Sîrkân, who would have always thought about their abundance which is due to the archangels, they have spoken with opponents about this interpretation of the section _of scripture_ (vîdak) [^15], _and_ so become similarly testifying [^16], thus: ‘We do not conceive it is necessary to demand thy reason _for_ this most grievous disaster [^17], a thing which is more complete through your elucidation of doubt and the power of the enemy, owing to this way which is appointed by thee.’ 15. And on that account, too, _it_ is more disquieting unto me, when I am aware both of the origin _of_ this perplexity _and_ the surpassing contamination which is possible to arise from it.

16\. And you always so observe as not to leap (la aîyyûkhtanŏ) without looking before; but temporary observation is nothing really of that _which_, by a well-stinging similitude, is what _one_ observes, with the eyesight looking well forward, _when_ dust of many kinds is domesticated with the sight of the <span id="p348"><sup><small>[ p. 348 ]</small></sup></span> eye; and if his intellect be not judicious he is wonderfully deceived by it; and _should_ it be even when he mentions the existence of two moons, _has it_ become more proved thereby? 17. _It is_ a custom of the most provoking in itself, and presented disquietingly when I, who believe with a fervent mind, _would have_ delivered the life even of _my_ body over to the perplexing bridge [^18] for your happiness _and_ enjoyment. 18. Also, on account of my want of leisure, even the information which is presented, asking peace, is information I believe with a generous mind; and _being_ aware regarding my want of leisure is both an advantage and harmful, and the heart to write of them [^19] is, therefore, miraculous. 19. Then it is always necessary for me, who _am_ in want of leisure, to write unto you so much writing of the harassing of annoyers _and_ against disputes, of whose end there is no conception in my heart.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (343:2) Reading nîhânŏ, as in J, but K35 and BK omit the first letter.

[^2]: (343:3) Assuming that mayâg is a pseudo-Huzvâri<i>s</i> equivalent of â<i>v</i>âg (Pers. âvâ); mayâ being the true Huzvâri<i>s</i> of â<i>v</i>, ‘water.’

[^3]: (344:1) A town in the extreme north-east of Khurâsân, between Nîshahpûhar and Marv, but nearer the latter city. When in this town Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam probably came in contact with the Tughazghuz mentioned in Chap. I, 12.

[^4]: (344:2) J inserts the words ‘by you, and through your good consideration it was more properly undeceiving, if done, then.’

[^5]: (344:3) Referring to his intended visit to Sîrkân, mentioned in Chaps. VI, 4, 6, VII, 3, Ep. I, xi, 4.

[^6]: (345:1) Referring probably to Ep. I, which appears to have been written from Shirâ<i>z</i> after holding as general assembly (see Chap. I, x, Ep. I, iii, 13); but this epistle, judging from the remark in the text, was probably written after Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar had left Shirâ<i>z</i>, as was also Ep. III (see Chap. VIII, 1).

[^7]: (345:2) From pollution.

[^8]: (345:3) See Chap. II, 1.

[^9]: (345:4) Assuming that the Pâz. p<i>g</i>sâhu stands for pa<i>z</i> sâkh-î: but, p. 346 as Av. <i>g</i> and <i>d</i> are much alike, it may be p<i>d</i>sâhu, which, when written in Pahlavi letters, can also be read pa<i>d</i> gêhan, ‘protector of the world;’ or p<i>d</i>sâhu may be merely a corruption of pa<i>d</i>shâh = pâ<i>d</i>akhshah, ‘sovereign.’

[^10]: (346:1) Meaning that he should have preferred being ignorant of such a decree, unless it exhibited far more knowledge of the truth than it actually did.

[^11]: (346:2) So written here in Pâzand; but, no doubt, the demon Vîzaresha (the Vîzarâsh of Dd. XXXII, 4, XXXVII, 44), who carries off the souls of the wicked, is meant.

[^12]: (346:3) The name, apparently, of some rival of his in authority, who is also mentioned in Chap. IX, 11.

[^13]: (347:1) Reading asp-vârakântûm, and this meaning tallies well with the previous mention of troops horsing themselves; but J, by pre-fixing a stroke, changes the word into vâspôharakântûm, ‘those most _renowned_ among the spheres.’

[^14]: (347:2) The ceremonial washers or priests.

[^15]: (347:3) The term vîdak is applied to sections or chapters of the Avesta in Dd. XLVII, 1, 5, 6, LXVI, 4; and here it must be applied to the Avesta of Vend. VIII or IX, to which the misinterpretations of. Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam specially referred.

[^16]: (347:4) J has ‘_and_ so given similar testimony, which is written by them of a priest of your fame, and written by them to me.’

[^17]: (347:5) The diminution of their means of livelihood by the decrease of ceremonial washing, more than their apprehension of the sinfulness of such decrease.

[^18]: (348:1) The <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, or passage to heaven (see Dd. XX, 3); meaning that he would have been ready to lose his life for the sake of his brother.

[^19]: (348:2) The heart to write of the ‘happiness and enjoyment’ of § 17.
