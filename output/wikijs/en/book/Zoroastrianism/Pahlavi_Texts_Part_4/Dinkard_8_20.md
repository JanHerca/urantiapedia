138\. About the obviousness of a minor adjudication from that which is greater. 139. About the extreme benefit _and_ peace, even in _this_ world, through a wife and children _and_ grandchildren, and also the prosperity, as regards produce and even wealth thereby, taking away the disputes that arise. 140. About the grievous sinfulness of wealth _acquired_ through unnatural intercourse [^1], the annihilation of the spiritual faculties (maînôgânŏ). 141. About a decree in which the decision is of three descriptions, about three persons. 142. About a tree which, when stolen away, is the death-blow (mât) of a hundred pure birds (vâê), _and_ a thousand birds arise.

143\. About a sin which, owing to deceiving previously, _has_ to increase (f<i>r</i><i>â</i><i>z</i> mastanŏ) _its_ extent, and to fully taste the extremest crime of a dagger <span id="p72"><sup><small>[ p. 72 ]</small></sup></span> (dahrakŏ) of several _of_ the smallest finger [_breadths_](errata_htm.html). 144.

This, too, that, when they encounter an apostate _and_ it is necessary to hold a controversy, though _there be_ danger for the hands or feet, _or_ though even for the head, _there is to be_ no refraining from asserting that which is true. <span id="p73"><sup><small>[ p. 73 ]</small></sup></span> 155. This, too, that he who does not assert, on account of fondness for wealth, or dislike for his own _people_, vexes water and fire and the righteous man, and disturbs even the reposing archangels from _their_ thrones.

156\. About the grievous sinfulness of making the righteous dissevered (aûsk<i>â</i>ftakŏ). 157.

164\. About property of seven kinds, of which _one_ says that _it_ is not allowable to take _it_ as security for other property. 165. About ten friends with different assertions on the same subject.

166\. And about the apportionment of this discourse _there are_ complete decisions of several other kinds, and into those, too, it advances and thereby introduces much adjudication which takes heed, in every one, of words and deeds of many kinds, and is specifically _and_ also intelligibly apportioned.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (53:1) It is not clear whether these twenty-four particulars are to be sought in the details of § 1, or in the whole chapter, or some portion of it.

[^2]: (53:2) Merely a guess.

[^1]: (54:1) Compare Pers. bi<i>s</i>ing, Av. fshaoni. In some cases it might perhaps be read pîkhvô, and be traced to Av. pithwa. The word often occurs, as in § 11, Chaps. XXIII, 3, 15, XXVI, 10, XXVII, 4, 6, XXXI, 25, 36, XXXVII, 5, 7, 22, XLI, 19, 23, XLIII, 19, and its meaning, ‘provision, or nourishment,’ is well ascertained.

[^1]: (55:1) One married to her husband with the parents’ consent, and never betrothed to another, so that she and her children belong to him in both worlds (see Bd. XXXII, 6 n).

[^1]: (56:1) The relative lengths of these five measures of distance are stated in Farh. Oîm, p. 41, ll. 9-11, as follows:—‘So much as two Dashmêst (Av. dakhshmaiti) is as much as a Yû<i>g</i>yast (Av. yu<i>g</i>yasti); so much as two Agoyôhast is as much as a Dashmêst; so much as two Ta<i>k</i>ar is as much as an Agoyôhast; _and_ so much as two Hâsar (Av. hâthra) is as much as a Ta<i>k</i>ar (Av. ta<i>k</i>ara).’ As the average Hâsar is a Roman mile (see Chap. XIX, 54 n), the Ta<i>k</i>ar (‘run?’) is two, the Agoyôst or Agoyôhast (‘cattle-run?’ p. 57 Av. gaoyaoiti?) is four, the Dashmêst (‘distance-mark?’) is eight, and the Yû<i>g</i>yâst (‘stage?’) is sixteen miles. This series of distances is analogous to the Sanskrit series, but more elaborate; the Hâsar is best compared with the Kro<i>s</i>a as the commonest unit of moderate distance, though less than half its usual length; the Agoyôst is nearly the same as the Gavyûta; and the Yû<i>g</i>yâst is analogous to the Yo<i>g</i>ana, though nearly double its length.

[^1]: (57:1) That is, on the first or second day of the Parsi month; and to the other on the third day.

[^1]: (58:1) See § 11 n.

[^2]: (58:2) A slave no doubt.

[^3]: (58:3) This is the technical term for legal seizure, or sequestration (see Chap. XXXIX).

[^1]: (59:1) See Chap. XVII, 6.

[^1]: (60:1) Or it may be ‘to provide supplies.’

[^2]: (60:2) See Chap. XIX, 47.

[^1]: (61:1) Pâz. aôganghen for Av. aoganghem = ao<i>g</i>anghem (see also Chap. XLI, 17, 18).

[^1]: (62:1) The decision announced at the <i>K</i>înva<i>d</i> bridge (see Chap. XIV, 8), as to the fate of the soul until the renovation of the universe, after the account of its good works and sins has been accurately balanced.

[^2]: (62:2) Farh. Oîm, p. 36, ll. 6, 7, has ‘when through sinfulness one lays a weapon upon a sinner, the name is Aredû<i>s</i>.’

[^3]: (62:3) See Chaps. XVII, 6, XIX, 1.

[^4]: (62:4) Whereby a person becomes an outcast and worthy of death. According to Vend. IV, 67-72, 75-78, 81-84, this occurs on the eighth committal of an Âgêreptŏ, on the seventh of an Avôîri<i>s</i>tŏ, and on the sixth of an Aredû<i>s</i>; or on the first committal of any of the three, if the criminal refuses to atone for it.

[^1]: (63:1) Eighty minutes on the average (see Chap. XIX, 54 n), but varying from one hour to two, according to the duration of daylight.

[^2]: (63:2) That is, from the scriptural law and its commentary.

[^3]: (63:3) That is, according to precedents recorded by the priesthood.

[^1]: (64:1) This term is explained in an extract from some Nask (compare Chap. XLIII, 9) quoted in Farh. Oîm, pp. 17, l. 9-18, l. 5, as follows:—‘_Av_. kô asti <i>d</i>kaêshô vivi<i>s</i>dâtô, which is the judge who is acquainted with the law? _Av_. yô aêta pairi arethra frazânaiti, he who thoroughly understands the adjudication from the statements \[even though he does not easily understand many of the statements, and though _it be_ not easy as regards the statements which are not numerous, is an official who is acquainted with the law (ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>âr-î âkâs-dâ<i>d</i>); _and he_ who does not thoroughly understand the adjudication from the statements, even though the statements are not numerous, and _it be_ not easy _for him_ as regards _them_, is to be still considered as unacquainted with the law (anâkâs-dâ<i>d</i>)\].’

[^2]: (64:2) Compare § 115.

[^1]: (65:1) The minimum and maximum grades of value mentioned in Chap. XIX, 47. Here it is evident that mîdat and mozd are synonyms, the former being, no doubt, the Zvâri<i>s</i>, or Semitic, equivalent of the latter, compare Chald. מִדַּה.

[^2]: (65:2) Pahl. khâkûnîhâ, literally ‘through making a dust.’

[^3]: (65:3) Or it may be ‘of a man _and_ a woman who is domineeringly plundered.’

[^1]: (66:1) That is, in some very easy way. The intention was probably to discourage petty disputes between man and wife, by not interfering with the stronger party when aggrieved.

[^1]: (67:1) See Chap. XVII, 6.

[^2]: (67:2) See § 65.

[^3]: (67:3) Reading dêv-vi<i>g</i>în which is miswritten ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg).

[^4]: (67:4) See Chap. XIX, 54 n.

[^5]: (67:5) A distance of four Hâsars (Bd. XVI, 7), or as far as a far-seeing man can distinguish a black ox from a white one (Bd. XXVI, 2). It is usually from 3½ to 4 English miles, but in Pahlavi texts it often stands for a Hâsar, or Roman mile, both being measures for long distances.

[^6]: (67:6) Or ‘rations’ (vâyagân).

[^1]: (68:1) Compare § 79.

[^1]: (69:1) In hell (compare AV. XL, 7).

[^2]: (69:2) Pahl. mar’<i>z</i>ânân, which might be supposed to be a defective writing of margar’<i>g</i>ânân, ‘those worthy of death’ (the two letters equivalent to rga being omitted), but see Chap. XXI, 13.

[^3]: (69:3) The MS. pâk is evidently a defective writing for na<i>v</i>âk which is written correctly in the next clause of this section.

[^1]: (70:1) The Persian monarch.

[^1]: (71:1) Vâmkûnîh, compare Pers. bâmûn. It cannot be ‘making loans, or money-lending,’ because that would be spelt <i>â</i><i>v</i>âmkûnîh.

[^1]: (72:1) The angel of justice who weighs the good works of the departed soul against its sins, in order to decide its fate till the end of time.

[^1]: (73:1) Here written Hâ<i>d</i>ôîtô; the name of the twentieth Nask (see Chap. XLV).

[^1]: (74:1) The name of the eleventh Nask (see Chap. XII).
