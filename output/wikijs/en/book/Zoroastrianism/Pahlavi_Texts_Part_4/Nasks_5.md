## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK III. CHAPTER CLXV.

1\. About the purport of the evidence _of_ the three codes of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, one as regards the other, there is verbal evidence of the Gâthic from the Hadha-mãthric and the Law, and about the Hadha-mãthric and the Law from the Gâthas. 2. The purport, too, of the statement _that_ occurs is this of a ruler putting aside the commands of an enemy—which are declared, _in_ many passages (dîvâk) of the Hadha-mãthric and even of the Legal, _to be_ worthiness of death—the purport _being_ in the words of a Gâthic phrase (nisang) _that_ is <span id="p409"><sup><small>[ p. 409 ]</small></sup></span> even this:—‘He who is a good ruler is a desire _and_ bringing on of fortune for me (va<i>l</i>am) [^1].’ 3. All rulers also for the world have arisen _for_ their own, and for maintaining him who is high-priest; they are submissive, and _any one_ accomplishing their commands—which are putting aside the commands of their enemy—is, owing to their submissiveness, authorisedly maintaining his own person and wealth _in_ the world thereby, _and_ in the world there is no place, _nor_ yet a share of anything therefrom, on account of which he becomes offended by the world.

4 The evidence of the Hadha-mãthric and of the Legal about a Gâthic statement is the purport _of_ these words in a Gâthic phrase, that ‘not _for_ him who is rightly proceeding is _there_ further ruin [^2];’ _and_ the evidence from the Hadha-mãthric is even this which states that ‘rectitude assists a man like a regiment a thousand strong [^3];’ also for the proportion of rectitude in _his_ possession there is no disturbance whatever, and from the hurtful (vinâsîgânŏ) from without _he_ is thus protected, because fully-worshipping (pûr-y<i>a</i><i>z</i>ân) performance is freedom from danger from the want of freedom from wickedness (<i>a</i>\-adarvandîh) of the enemy, as regards benefit, through the doing of injury by him.

5\. And on account of the superior knowledge of the spiritual _existence_, moreover, for the Gâthas, above the intermediate Hadha-mãthric _and_ the lower knowledge of the Law, the purpose of the Gâthic _was_ for the statements of the Legal _and_ the _Hadha-_mãthric, and the provision of the Hadha-mãthric <span id="p410"><sup><small>[ p. 410 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ the Legal was evidently for the statements of the Gâthas.

6\. One [^1] is _that_, on account of him who gave the Legal, and is <i>a</i>lso the protector of a priestly master who is given over to the Hadha-mãthric, and the Gâthic, through which the purity of the good creations arises, _one_ is more steadfastly to aggrandise and develope _them_.     .     .     .     .     .     .

[408:1](sbe37122_htm.html) See [p. 407](sbe37121_htm.html), n. [2](sbe37122_htm.html).

[408:2](sbe37122_htm.html) Compare Dk. VIII, Chap. I, 13, 14.

[^1]: (409:1) Pahl. Yas. L, 1 a.

[^2]: (409:2) Pahl. Yas. XXIX, 5 C.

[^3]: (409:3) Dk. IX, Chap. XX, 4.

[^1]: (410:1) This is the fourth of ‘the ten admonitions of the righteous <i>S</i>ênôv about the law of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion.’ In the seventh book of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> it is stated that as regards the high-priests this, too, is said on the subject of <i>S</i>ênôv, that one hundred years of the religion elapse when <i>S</i>ênôv is born, and two hundred years when he passes away; he was also the first Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper with a life of a hundred years (100 khayâ), and who walks forth upon this earth with a hundred disciples.' This last clause clearly identifies him with the ‘Saêna, _son_ of Ahûm-stu<i>d</i>, who first appeared upon this earth with a hundred pupils,’ as stated in Yt. XIII, 97 (see Darmesteter, _Textes pehlvis relatifs au Judaisme_, première partie, p. 3, n. 2).
