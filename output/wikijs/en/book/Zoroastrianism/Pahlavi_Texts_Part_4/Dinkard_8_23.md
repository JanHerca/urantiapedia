## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XXIII.

_Ganabâ-sar-ni<i>g</i>a_d _Nask_.

1\. One section of _the next_ twelve is the Pasû<i>s</i>\-haûrvastân ('_shepherd's-dog code_'), about the shepherd who is selecting a shepherd's dog for the sheep, and the shepherd with various shepherd's dogs; about the shepherd's comprehension of their serviceableness, one with the other, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 2. The extent of authorised efficiency (<i>s</i>alît-gârîkîh) accomplished by the shepherd's-dog nature of a shepherd's dog, after his _being_ appointed by the shepherd.

3\. About the shepherd's preparing the means of bedding [^1] for the shepherd's dog, giving the amount of the price of the daily _food_ of a shepherd's dog, provisions for the dog in the winter, and the preparation of a fire beforehand which it is necessary to make in the sheepfold (pâh-hastŏ). 4. About the mode of preparing the appointed _fire_place _of_ the sheepfold, the position of the shepherd's dog and the dog's fire, the means of lodging _and_ provisioning the shepherd's dog in the sheepfold, the sin owing to _the occasions_ when _one_ proceeds to provide _another_ mode, _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

5\. About the diligence of the shepherd's dog, and about _his_ being guardian _of_ the sheep asleep at night <span id="p82"><sup><small>[ p. 82 ]</small></sup></span> in flocks [^1] dreading distress; the dog, _their_ protection, is not provided with bedding, _nor_ with pillow, and they are happy; every night _he has_ to come out, through the whole flock, three times, besides when one of the guards (pa<i>d</i>ânŏ), who is apprehensive, counts _them, who_, every day _at_ dawn, _has_ to walk out among the sheep, with good words, to inspect _them_, to apply remedies properly _to_ the sheep that are sick, wounded, bruised, _or_ defective, _and_ to be _their_ guardian; _also_ the sin owing to worrying _them, and_ whatever is on the same subject. 6. About that which is to be done by him as regards the breeding of the sheep, _and_ likewise for the sake of the young ones; _and_ the sin when _he does_ not _do it_, or shall act otherwise. 7. About his fully understanding where _and_ which is the sheep for _each_ young one. 8. About his habit and means of keeping away the thief _and_ the wolf from the sheep, _and_ the preservation of the sheep thereby when an awful cloud and wind and rain arise, _or_ when the position of those distressed ones, at the fords of rivers, comes opposite a locality (nisi<i>s</i>no) of bad footing; when it is not possible for him _to save_ all, _he has_ to save the greater in value, or the more in number.

9\. About his _having_ guarded a sheep from the pasture of others _and_ the retribution for the, sin of not _having_ guarded as to the eating _and_ damaging of the corn and pasture of others by the sheep. 10. About the extent of preservation by the shepherd's dog's driving the sheep from the corn and pasture _of_ others of various species, such as that which _one_ calls the very stupid (gôltar) pig; there is, moreover, <span id="p83"><sup><small>[ p. 83 ]</small></sup></span> the specified pasture as regards those sheep, _but_ the pig, which feeds upon its own predecessors, is also that _which_ may commit another sin, for it feeds upon even _its_ progeny at birth.

11\. About the indication of an assembly place (garang) for the sheep, in a warm _or_ cool locality, by the shepherd's dog. 12. About the characteristics of sheep from one to four years _of age_. 13. About the village (vîs) of the shepherd, where the shepherd's dog is known when he arrives; how it is when a sheep _has_ to be kept out of the sheepfold _by_ the shepherd's dog, _and_ how _it is_ when it has to be driven by him to the village of the heedful shepherd. 14. About the coming of the shepherd unto a sheep, _and_ the path from the village which the shepherd _has_ provided for [^1] the flock.

15\. About a shepherd when he withholds the daily _food_ of a shepherd's dog, and the exhaustion of life thereby; after the fourth deprival of food (atapak-dâ<i>d</i>ŏ) [^2] _it_ is allowable for the shepherd's dog to kill a sheep for nourishment. 16. About a sheep, _which_ comes astray into the flock to be slaughtered, _being_ the perquisite of the butcher (bâhar-î kû<i>s</i>târ), and that of the shepherd's dog _being_ its dog [^3] and the appointed number of one sheep. 17. About _their_ extent of movement, and their pregnancy and growing old (bâr va-khasân). 18. About the sin of the shepherd, as regards the shepherd's dog, through injustice as to work, <span id="p84"><sup><small>[ p. 84 ]</small></sup></span> reward, _and_ chastisement; _and of_ the shepherd's dog, as regards the shepherd, through improperly tending a sheep, _or_ worrying _it_ by exertion; also his chastisement, and the payment that occurs for the incompetence _and_ unworthiness therein; _besides_ adjudications between the shepherd _and_ shepherd's dog.

19\. About the instruction which the shepherd _gives_ to the shepherd's dog, through reminders (pavan ayâ<i>d</i>îhâ), to control a sheep, when, the shepherd's dog _having_ heard _some musical_ notes (srû<i>d</i>ŏ gâsânŏ), the instruction took place in the form of words; and, when the notes _were_ not heard, even by a blow (zatam), the means of that instructor _being_ a blow. 20. About the peculiarity of the shepherd's dog as regards _its_ employment (rô<i>g</i>kâr) at the periods of satisfying menstrual excitement, solemnizing the season-festivals, _and_ other important good works.
