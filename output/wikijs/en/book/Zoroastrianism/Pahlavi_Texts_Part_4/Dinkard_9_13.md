## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XIII.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The twelfth fargar<i>d</i>, U<i>s</i>tavaiti [^1], is about the exaltation of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through the satisfaction of water, and the hope of all creatures for him. 2. And about the impure recitation of a text, when [^2] the text is not uttered by a high-priest. 3. This, too, that the text which a man who is corrupted may <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> offer is an impropriety (adînâîh) for that which is an uncorrupted place. 4. This, too, is declared, that a greedy man whose belly is filled by accumulation—and the end of every sin is, to him, only for the gratification of the body—_one_ considers just like a gallows to which _there_ is a foundation (<i>s</i>îpŏ) of every impurity. 5. This, too, that a bird (vâê) practises that habit (<i>s</i>ân) even that it kills those outright which have become large in _our_ midst, which are the serpents produced by the demons. 6. This, too, that _for_ invocation (azbâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the sacred beings thinking with speaking, speaking with acting, and acting without deceitfulness are effectual.

7\. About the pure goodness of the archangels, and the union of their thoughts, words, _and_ deeds together; their bountifulness, nurturing, and protection are the cause [^3] of the prosperity of the world. 8. About the production of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> with a goodness like his own. 9. This, too, that whoever gives anything to the disciples of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, his reward and recompense are just as though the thing had been given by him to Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^4].

10\. It is perfect excellence _that is_ righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (195:2) The appellation of the first hâ of the second Gâtha (Yas. XLIII) which begins with the words u<i>s</i>tâ ahmâi yahmâi u<i>s</i>tâ; it is here written aû<i>s</i>tavâîtŏ in Pahlavi.

[^2]: (195:3) Assuming that mûn, ‘which,’ stands for amat; the Pâzand of both words being practically the same. Or, it may be, ‘also him who does not utter the text through a high-priest.’

[^3]: (196:1) B omits sân, ‘the cause of.’

[^4]: (196:2) Compare:—‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.’ (Matthew XXV. 40.)
