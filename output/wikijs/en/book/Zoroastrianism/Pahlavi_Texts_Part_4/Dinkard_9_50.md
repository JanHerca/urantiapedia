## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER L.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. Propitiation _for_ the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and a scornful dole _for_ the evil spirit.

2\. The fourth fargar<i>d</i> is the Yânîm-manô [^1] of the Bakŏ, about the praise of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, that is, his jurisdiction, invocation of blessing (yânŏ) [^2], and speaking _in_ reply were such as are declared by the _sacred_ text. 3. This, too, that that jurisdiction of his arose before the blessing, that is, this one decision is made by him about his own, that his own person is first made deserving by him through virtue, and then virtue is prayed for by him [^3].

4\. This, too, that he has attributed the source _and_ result to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, who gives joy to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; for the source and result of various advantages _and_ various joys are desirable for joy itself, as joy is the acme (rôê<i>s</i>man) of every happiness _of him_ whose joy _has_ made an offering (aûstôfrî<i>d</i>ŏ) to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, because his decision is this, that by him whose joy arises from that thing which is the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, its source _and_ result are attributed to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 5. This, too, that the good work, which is a gratification _by_ lawful gratifiers [^4], becomes appropriated by him who shall perform that which is truly reverent; even for this reason, because he who is a lawful gratifier of others, through true reverence, _has_ intended to gratify through the practice of his reverence, and, when thus the gratifier of those persons, the good work of gratification <span id="p312"><sup><small>[ p. 312 ]</small></sup></span> _by_ lawful gratifiers becomes appropriated. 6. This, too, that the wisdom of Vohûman [^5] is advanced by him who utters a discourse through Vohûman; for this reason, because the wisdom of Vohûman and its advancement are mostly through discourse. 7. This, too, that the plentifulness and satisfaction of cattle [^5] are taught by him who properly maintains the cattle which are in his possession; even for this reason, owing to the multitudes thus _belonging_ to _him_ who properly maintains the cattle which are in his possession, he gains his profit _and_ pleasure therefrom, _and_ others, who see that gain, are instructed, even as much as he, about the proper maintenance of cattle for their own profit _and_ pleasure.

8\. This, too, that benefit [^6] _being_ given for the benefit _of_ the worthy _man_ is taught by him who keeps the benefit that is his as the property _of_ the sacred beings; even for this reason, because he gives the benefit that is his unto the worthy _man_ for the purpose of keeping _it_ for the advantage of the sacred beings, and others are instructed about it. 9. This, too, that prosperity [^7] _being_ given, in both existences [^6], to him who is generous _and_ worthy is taught by him who gives benefit to a worthy _man_ possessing body and life; even for this reason, because a worldly _existence_ and a spiritual _one_ are both his, also his worldly _existence_ is in this existence, _and_ the spiritual _one_ in that existence wherefrom satisfaction _for_ the giving of benefit arrives. 10. This, too, that by him who shall cause reverence [^8] of the good, even this is taught, that the sacred <span id="p313"><sup><small>[ p. 313 ]</small></sup></span> beings gratify him who is practising their will; even for this reason, because good for him, by whom the reverence is practised, becomes the reply of satisfaction, _and_ the throne of the sacred beings is certain.

11\. This, too, that _he_ who _was_ at first has taught even this to mankind, that supplicants [^9] _for_ the favour of the sacred beings gratify the sacred beings by being contented (pa<i>d</i>v<i>â</i><i>z</i>); even for this reason, because the welcome of a sacred being, supplied by command from the religion, is a virtuousness in the world distinct from that, and the production of a course of generosity, from the sacred beings to mankind, arises really through the contentment of the favoured; _and_ mankind thereby become freer from doubt, and believe more in the sacred beings. 12. This, too, that his soul is delivered, _or will_ be delivered, into the supreme heaven [^10], who _has_ given something to him who praises the sacred beings _and_ the good; even for this reason, because even through liberality as to wealth, and the production of a way to the supreme heaven, _it_ is manifest _that_ anything given to the praisers of the sacred beings _and_ the good is a greater liberality. 13. This, too, that the reverence [^11] of those needing reverence is occasioned by him who teaches the _sacred_ word (v<i>â</i><i>k</i>akŏ) to the good; even for this reason, because he who is a good teacher of revelation (dênô) can bring _it_ into use for the reverence, advantage, _and_ joy of the sacred beings _and_ the good.

14\. This, too, that acquaintance with the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^11] is disclosed to his own by him who loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because true <span id="p314"><sup><small>[ p. 314 ]</small></sup></span> knowledge arises from the discrimination of pure wisdom, and the pure attainment of the most discriminative spiritual lord (ahvô) to the mind, through the purity that constitutes the way within the mind of a spiritual lord, the purity which becomes that way through the lodgment of Vohûman there. 15. This, too, that righteousness is taught [^12] _by him_ who keeps _his_ mind connected with righteousness; even for this reason, because his mind attains to an effort for authority, and, ridden by the effort, _attains_ to _its_ acquisition. 16. This, too, that by him who gives commands about the progress of the concerns of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, this is also taught to mankind, namely, when _one_ sees the throne of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^13]; even for this reason, because it is possible to see that throne through the complete progress _of_ the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in the world; _and_ whoever gives commands about the progress of the concerns of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is necessary in him, the progressive share of those concerns for the people of the world _being_ shown, which is seen even through that foundation, of completeness that becomes the throne of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _for_ mankind.

i7. This, too, that by him who welcomes Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in _him_self [^14], matters only known by even a high-priest are then taught to mankind; even for this reason, because instruction and knowledge are mostly those through a high-priest, and by him who welcomes Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in _him_self, a spiritual lord is then prayed for, who becomes glorious and praised for that which is to be taught, and mankind are taught by him. 18. This, too, that by any one good, who <span id="p315"><sup><small>[ p. 315 ]</small></sup></span> is a servant _and_ pleaser of a good ruler, a good person may be brought forward, to him who is the ruler, for benefit [^15]; even for this reason, because a good _man_ associates other good people with him in the benefit that happens to him, and _his_ character, temper, _and_ disposition are thus due to that; but when bringing himself forward to rulers, through reverence _and_ gratification _of_ the rulers, other good people may also be brought forward by him for that benefit. 19. This, too, that by him _who_ shall virtuously make an accumulation, the way of prosperity [^16] from the sacred beings is disclosed to his own; even for this reason, because virtuous accumulation is provided through unnumbered (<i>a</i>pênavâ<i>d</i>ŏ) grants of a decider, and, when _it is_ so, he becomes the treasurer of the sacred beings.

20\. This, too, that by him who produces advantage for the archangels, the gift of him who is suitable for the sovereignty [^17] of the immature (khâm) world is solicited; even for this reason, because the advantage which is produced for the archangels _being_ for the sake of his own, the advantage of the immature creation solicited—the supreme advantage of the primitive good creations—becomes a virtuous ruler. 21. This, too, that by him who is a praiser [^17] of an archangel, the good religion is praised; even for this reason, because the good religion is praise of the archangels, _and_ the praise of the archangels is the good religion. 22. This, too, that the religion of the sacred beings is made progressive [^17] by him who shall make an offering (aûstôfrî<i>d</i>ŏ) _to_ the <span id="p316"><sup><small>[ p. 316 ]</small></sup></span> sacred beings; even for this reason, because making an offering _to_ the sacred beings strengthens the upholders of religion, and the progress of religion occurs through upholders of religion.

23\. This, too, that by him who shall make mankind quite zealous (garemôkŏ) for doing good works, the reward of the good works is also made liberal for mankind; even for this reason, because the producer of the origin is also the producer of the result. 24. This, too, that above the multitude is the praise of the man who is assisting those of virtuous will, who is also the nourishment of the creatures through virtuousness, and whose accumulation is also owing to virtuousness; even for this reason, because whoever is assisting those of virtuous will is an increaser of virtuousness in the world, whoever is the nourishment of the creatures through virtuousness is a producer of the paternity of creatures, _and he_ whose accumulation is owing to virtuousness becomes an improver of the world. 25. This, too, that by him who assists him who is ignorant (kha<i>s</i>t), is given _and_ taught to supplicants that which is suitable for them. 26. To assist him who is ignorant is this, such as forming the province, district, domain, _and_ family; maintaining the abode _and_ house of a follower of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp (Vi<i>s</i>tâs<i>p</i>anŏ), the fortress _and_ stronghold, and the homestead (khân) of the agricultural peasant; repairing a rugged road; building bridges over rivers; managing a river, aqueduct, or brook; populating desolate places; _and_ doing other things, owing to which any retention (gîrift-aê) of the comfort and advantage of mankind in the world occurs. 27. And by him who shall do these things, the assistance even of him who is born afterwards, <span id="p317"><sup><small>[ p. 317 ]</small></sup></span> the making of that which is a very advantageous thing suitable _for_ mankind, and also the doing _of this_ for others, are taught.

28\. This, too, that it is revealed (<i>k</i>âshtô) of the spiritual existence _that_ that which is wisdom is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, for him who is wisdom—that is, it teaches _that_ acquired _wisdom_ is for him whose innate wisdom is good—even for this reason, because the spirit, this that has come into his possession, which is acquired wisdom, is given by it to the progeny of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, which is innate wisdom, to increase _it; and_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is gratified thereby.

29\. Of a summary about the continuance _that_ was, the progress of the material _existence, and_ the continuance _that will_ be [^18], _there_ is also this:—about the continuance _that_ was, which is the beginning, _there are_ the essential thought _and_ beneficent production of the good and evil material _existence_ of its good goodness, and that of _its_ evil vileness; about the progress of the material _existence_, which is intermediate, _there are_ the dutiful doing of good works, righteousness, and having reward, the committal of crime, wickedness, _and_ having the bridge _penalty; and_ about the continuance _that will_ be, which is the last, _there are_ the government, with wisdom, of that supremely good _one_ who is the origin of all the multitudinous _creatures_ (vasîkân), the triumph of goodness over vileness, the admissibility _of_ the good, the inadmissibility of the bad, _and_ the purity of the restoration of the good creatures.

30\. Of righteousness perfect is the excellence.
