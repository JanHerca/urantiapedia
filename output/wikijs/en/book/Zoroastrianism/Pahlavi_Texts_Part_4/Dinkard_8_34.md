About the impoverishment owing to the completion of the possessions given, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 4. About a father who _has_ sons, and _for_ which _of them_ a wife is to be earlier sought. 5. _Also_ about which of _his_ daughters is to be given away to a husband, and whatever is on the same subject.

6\. About the progressive meritoriousness of a righteous gift for a woman, _and_ the grievous sinfulness owing to _its being_ dissipated. 7.

About a foreigner when an Irânian asks _him_ for a reward for assistance in battle with his fellow-tribesmen, _and_ the foreigner does not become generous, though the recompense is for the generosity of the Irânians.

9\. About the offering up (madam dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) of water; that which is an appointed indicator (numû<i>d</i>âr), and that which is no indicator; that which is an indicator of complete presentation, _and_ that of partial presentation; that water which is continually producing the offering up (û<i>z</i>dahînâk), in like manner, of something of the things of a righteous gift, through the moistened peculiarity and distinction [^1] of an offering-producing gift of a male from _that of_ a female; and that which is an indicator both male and female, and a voice producing offerings, is animate, _or_ inanimate, _or derived_ from the inanimate; that which is an indicator is a germ (tôkhmakŏ-1), that which is in a germ is of one species, that which is in a species is of one form, _and_ the proportion that is appointed is completed, _though_ the purpose for which _it_ is appointed _has_ not arisen; _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

10\. About the five best and five worst actions, the seven [^2] heinous sins, _and_ the three sins that are very ill-atoned for. 11. About the sin of staining with bodily refuse, injuring the existence [^3], _and_ of a <span id="p108"><sup><small>[ p. 108 ]</small></sup></span> death-producing formation _as to_ clothing. 12. About the sin owing to idleness when, moreover, that which they might do is good. 13. About a decision as to the justifiableness of clothing, arms, equipments, and _other_ things _being_ given to foreigners, besides promoting their service and business, and _giving them_ any assistance whatever, _or_ listening to that which relates to assistance; likewise listening to drunkards. 14. About unlawfully destroying _and_ cutting plants, _with_ a decision about it.

15\. About the sin of digging a grave [^1] for burying a corpse, _whether_ of the idolators (dêvîyastân) _or_ non-idolators, and _of supplying_ clothing for the corpse of a dead _one_ of the idolators. 16. About him who threw bodily refuse [^2] _on_ to fire _or_ water, _or_ _any_ place _or_ garment _on_ which _it_ is not authorisedly _cast_, to make Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers polluted; _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

17\. An account of water as regards the description _and_ extent of moisture of the land. 18. About the sin owing to rendering anything useless through water _or_ fire. 19. About carrying off two-thirds _of_ the misery from the world, by eradicating _it_ from the creatures through all the illumination of fires; _and_ carrying off all adversity from the period of the creatures, through the freedom from malice of mankind, one as regards the other, _and_ through _their_ perfect sympathy together.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (107:1) The Pahl. text is pavan mamanîh va-ka<i>d</i>âmîh-i namî<i>d</i>ŏ. Possibly namî<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘moistened,’ may stand for numû<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘indicated;’ but the whole sentence is more or less obscure.

[^2]: (107:2) Written 4 + 2 (= six) in the MS., but this is a most unusual way of writing ‘six;’ it is more probable that we ought to read 4 + 3, the usual mode of writing ‘seven.’ ‘Seven evil-doers of sin of a heinous kind’ are detailed in Dd. LXXII, 2-9.

[^3]: (107:3) Pahl. bâîô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i>ŏ, see Chap. XIX, 1 n.

[^1]: (108:1) Assuming that gôbar _kh<i>e</i>k_îrûntanŏ stands for gôbar (Pers. gôr) _kh_efrûntanŏ.

[^2]: (108:2) See Chap. XIX, 3.
