## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXXIII.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The tenth fargar<i>d</i>, Yathâi<i>s</i> [^3], is about the renovation _of the universe_ in the words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, thus: ‘I _have_ produced the effecter of the renovation, the causer of righteousness, Sôshâns, _of_ whom mankind say that he does not come; and _yet_ he _will_ come, for the righteous, with that glory _which_ becomes all-brilliance.’

2\. About the scrutiny and consideration for moderation in a high-priest's performance _of_ every <span id="p261"><sup><small>[ p. 261 ]</small></sup></span> duty _there_ is this, too, that the desire of that non-assailant, who is a producer of benefit among kinsmen, among confederates, _and_ among serfs [^1], as regards anything whatever, is accomplishing the will, and is a friend, of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and the spirit lodging in him is not deceived by him. 3. And advice about distance from him in whom similarity of disposition _to_ the fiend and arrogance are oppressive, _and who_ is scorning kinsmen, a sharp liar with serfs [^2], giving offence (vêshîn-dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) _to_ confederates, careless of cattle [^3], _and_ unfriendly _to_ the wretched.

4\. About the bridge on which _there_ is access to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^4], _and_ he who reaches the best existence is visibly, _or_ invisibly, proceeding _while_ offering up (aû<i>z</i>dahân-sagîtûn). 5. And the teaching of the primitive faith to Zaratû<i>s</i>t _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _who_ remained embodying the Ahunavair (ahûnavair-tanû) _as_ the Zôti [^5] of the world; _and_ at the time of the renovation Zaratû<i>s</i>t, who _was_ from the sons of Aêzemnô, is in the position of Zôti [^6] of the whole <span id="p262"><sup><small>[ p. 262 ]</small></sup></span> world; Vohûvastŏ, _son_ of Snôê [^1], from the countries of those of the religion, in the post of Hâvanân [^2]; Îsvand, son of Var<i>â</i><i>z</i>, from the countries of Tûrân, in the post of Âtarevakhsh; <i>S</i>ênô, son of Hûmstûv, from the countries of the Sênân [^3], in the post of Frabar<i>d</i>âr; and Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, who _was_ from the sons of Nô<i>d</i>ar [^4], in the post of Srôshâvar’<i>z</i>. 6. About the power and triumph which that ceremonial becomes, even through the all-brilliance of the immortal renovation of the whole creation in that existence.

7\. This, too, that the evil spirit [^5]. . . . . . . . . . . .

## Footnotes

[^3]: (260:3) See Chap. X, 1 n; it is here written yasââî<i>s</i> in Pahlavi.

[^1]: (261:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXIII, 3 a, b.

[^2]: (261:2) Ibid. 4 b.

[^3]: (261:3) Ibid. 4 c.

[^4]: (261:4) Ibid. 5 c.

[^5]: (261:5) Ibid. 6 a. It is said, in Bd. XXX, 30, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> comes to the world as Zôti, or chief officiating priest, with Srôsh as assistant priest, just before the renovation. Here it is not absolutely certain whether Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, or Zaratû<i>s</i>t, is meant as Zôti on this first occurrence of the word.

[^6]: (261:6) Reading min A<i>ê</i>\-zemnôân pavan zôt gâs; Ayazem being an ancestor of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, eleven generations back, the grandfather of Spitama, and the name being variously written Aiazemn, Ayâzem, Nayâzem, and Aizim in different MSS. Another reading is min 3 zamôn khûpŏ zôt gâs, ‘from three-fold _procreation, has_ the happy position of Zôti,’ referring to the legendary account of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's origin, as detailed in the seventh book of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>. The position of the Zôti is at the north end of the ceremonial area.

[^1]: (262:1) This and the two following persons are the Vohvasti _son_ of Snaoya, Isva<i>d</i> _son_ of Varâza, and Saêna _son_ of Ahûm-stû<i>d</i>, of Yt. XIII, 96, 97.

[^2]: (262:2) In the great ceremonies of ancient times the Hâvanân appears to have been the priest who attended to the Hôm-mortar, and his position was near the north-west corner of the ceremonial area; the Âtarevakhsh was the priest who fed the fire, and his position was near the south-west corner; the Frabar<i>d</i>âr was the priest who brought the necessary utensils, and his position was near the northeast corner; and the Srôshâvar’<i>z</i> was the priest who kept general order, his position being at the south end, facing the Zôti at the north end. Besides these five priests, mentioned in our text, there were three others enumerated in Vîsp. III, 1; Vend. V, 58, VII, 17, 18, the water-bringer near the south-east corner, the washer on the west side, and the cleanser on the east side. In modern times the Zôti retains his ancient duties of chief priest, while the Râspî (Bk. VIII, Chap. VII, 5, 9) combines the duties of the seven others, being called by the Zôti (in Vîsp. III, 1) to take the place of each of them in succession.

[^3]: (262:3) Av. Sâininãm of Yt. XIII, 144, probably the people about Samarkand (see Bd. XII, 13 n, XV, 29).

[^4]: (262:4) See Yt. V, 98.

[^5]: (262:5) One folio of B is here lost, containing the end of this chapter and the beginning of the next. The passage missing was equivalent to about 100 lines of this translation, of which perhaps one-fourth belonged to this chapter and three-fourths to the next.
