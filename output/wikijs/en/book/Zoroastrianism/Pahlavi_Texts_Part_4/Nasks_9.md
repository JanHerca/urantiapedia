## III. FROM THE RIVÂYAT OF NARÊMÂN HÔSHANG [^3]

1\. Again, that which is in Pahlavi characters is clear _in_ that manner, that in the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô there are twenty-one vocables, that is, twenty-one words, and beneath each word there is an equivalent meaning; it is also known to the devout _that_ there are twenty-one Nasks of the Avesta.

2\. The first Nask is of thirty-three subdivisions, that is, it is of thirty-three compilations, and its name is Stôd-ya<i>s</i>t, that is, ‘producing the praise of the sacred beings;’ and the words of the book _have_ come down for the majesty of the sacred beings and angels, and they recite _them_ in that manner; and _in_ the presence of every high-priest of the pure ritual, who rightly understands its Avesta and Zand, <span id="p429"><sup><small>[ p. 429 ]</small></sup></span> as he recites _them_ correctly on three occasions, the angels come down; of this there is no doubt.

3\. The name of the second is Istûdgar, and it is of twenty-two subdivisions; its statements are for the admonition of the people.

4\. The name of the third Nask is Vahi<i>s</i>t-mânthrah, and it is of twenty-two subdivisions; its purport is to bring confirmation of the religion.

5\. The name of the fourth is Bagh, and this is of twenty-one subdivisions; its explanation is about heedfulness.

6\. The name of the fifth is Dvâzdah-hâmâst, and it is of thirty-two subdivisions; its explanation is in remembrance of the upper world, and about the lower world.

7\. The name of the sixth is Nâdar, and that is of thirty-five compilations; its explanation is about the interpretation of the world of the stars, the planets and constellations, and understanding the arrangement of the sky.

8\. The seventh is the Pâ<i>g</i>am; this Nask is of twenty-two subdivisions, and its explanation is with regard to lawful and unlawful animals, whenever they slaughter _them_ for the sake of solemnizing a season-festival; and, again, whatever is manifold reward and good work; also about the reason of the five days of the guardian spirits, which they call the select, _and_ wherefore they are appointed.

9\. The name of the eighth is Ratu<i>s</i>tâyî, and it is of fifty subdivisions, of which, after _the time of_ Alexander, they preserved and found no more _than_ thirteen subdivisions; its explanation is about maintaining devotion, and _of_ obedience to kings, high-priests, and governors. <span id="p430"><sup><small>[ p. 430 ]</small></sup></span> 10\. The name of the ninth is Bari<i>s</i>, and this Nask was of sixty subdivisions, _but_ after _the time of_ Alexander they found no more _than_ twelve subdivisions; its explanation is _of_ those who are kings and high-priests, leaders and princes, judges and messengers, what is the nature of the authority of peasants and princes, and what kind of towns they possess.

11\. The name of the tenth is Ka<i>s</i>srôb, and this Nask has been of sixty subdivisions, _but_ after _the time of_ Alexander they found again no more _than_ fifteen subdivisions; its explanation is about the distinction of natural wisdom and knowledge from acquired knowledge; that which makes mankind pure from defilement, and the usage that maintains the proceedings of mankind.

12\. The eleventh is the Nask of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp-shâh, and it has been of sixty subdivisions, _but_ after _the time of_ Alexander they found again no more _than_ ten subdivisions, and _their_ statements are with regard to king Gu<i>s</i>tâsp making the religion current.

13\. The name of the twelfth is ‘<i>H</i>a<i>s</i>t, and it is of twenty-two subdivisions; its explanation is about enquiry of wisdom, maintaining devotion in the world, _and_ the punishment for every sin _such_ as they supply _it_.

14\. The name of the thirteenth is Sfend, and it is of sixty subdivisions; its explanation is _of_ that which they demonstrate _as_ miracles from this Nask, that every requirement comes to pass _which_ every high-priest—_who_ shall recite this Nask for several days with seven_fold_ voice, according to that which has been written—shall solicit for the world.

15\. The name of the fourteenth is <i>G</i>ira<i>s</i>t, and <span id="p431"><sup><small>[ p. 431 ]</small></sup></span> this is of twenty-two subdivisions, its explanation is about the creation of the people of mankind in the day of the Eternal, until the last day of the resurrection occurs; their becoming manifest in the mother's womb, _and_ why some die in the womb and some are born, some are kings and some are peasants.

16\. The name of the fifteenth is Baghân-ya<i>s</i>t, _and_ this is of seventeen subdivisions; its explanation is about the praise of the angels admitted, and, _as to_ the servants of the Most Glorious, _at_ what period they each become manifest, and what duty they perform, till the resurrection.

17\. The name of the sixteenth is Niyâram, and this is of fifty-four subdivisions; its explanation is about decrees _as to_ traders, covenants and decisions, that is, awards with regard to the creatures _and_ how they act.

18\. The name of the seventeenth is Aspâram, and this is of sixty-four subdivisions; its explanation in these is well-directed and a good _thing;_ and whatever remains therein.

19\. The eighteenth is the Duvâsarô<i>g</i>ad, and it is of sixty-five subdivisions; its explanation is that which is a statement on the subject of Khêdyôdath, that is, forming a union with each other _by_ relations and those next _one another_.

20\. The name of the nineteenth is Askâram, and it is of fifty-two subdivisions; its explanation is about the occurrence of the production of the renovation _of the universe_, up to the resurrection _and_ future existence which are the converting of the dead alive, Aharman _and_ the demons becoming extinct, and the circumstances of those _events_. <span id="p432"><sup><small>[ p. 432 ]</small></sup></span> 21\. The name of the twentieth is <i>G</i>ud-dêv-dâd [^1], and that is of twenty-two subdivisions; its explanation is of causing the abstinence of mankind from pollution, that is, from defilement, and the assault of evil peculiarly owing to the great; _from_ the sight of a menstruous woman, and the like of these, whenever harm and injury happen to the creation.

22\. The name of the twenty-first is Hâdokht, and this is a book of thirty subdivisions; its explanation is such that the accursed devil goes far from every one _who_ shall recite this book together with the Ya<i>s</i>t, and this person becomes near unto the sacred being, the praiseworthy _and_ exalted, and in such manner as _he is_ near the sacred being in like manner he obtains rank.

23\. And the purpose of this _being_ written is so, that it is known to these humble individuals [^2] in this manner, that these books are of those tendencies, and it has been written _by_ those devout _ones_ [^3] in such manner that ‘among us no one is able to read the Pahlavi characters, and the interpretation of these Nasks is in Pahlavi; any one who does not know the Pahlavi characters is high-priest and is not able to demonstrate the miracles of the religion, nor that which was written with regard to the commentary of these Nasks.’
