## EXTANT FRAGMENTS. XIII. SPEND NASK [^1].

Dk. VIII, Chap. XIV, 1, probably refers to the passage that contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. X, 4, XII, 11:—‘_It is_ revealed in the Spend that _towards_ Dûkdâv, the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, when she was pregnant with Zaratû<i>s</i>t, every night _for_ three nights a leader with a hundred and fifty demons rushed (_or_ came) for the destruction of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, yet, owing to the existence of the fire in the dwelling, they knew no means of accomplishing _it_.’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XIV, 8, probably refers to the passage that contained the statement alluded to in AV. XXXII and thus quoted in Sls. XII, 29:—‘As in the Spend _it was_ shown to Zaratû<i>s</i>t about one man, that all _his_ limbs were in torment, _but_ one foot was outside; _and_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> about the cause _of it;_ and Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> said that he was a man, Davâns [^2] _by_ name; he was a ruler over thirty-three districts, and no good work _was_ ever practised by him, except one time when fodder _was_ conveyed by him to a sheep with that one foot.’

No allusion to the following two passages, quoted from the Spend, has been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chap. XIV:—

In Sls. XII, 3, it is said that ‘in the Spend _it_ is revealed that a fire, when they shall make it quite clean from its chilled charcoal, _has_ as much comfort as a man whose clothing they shall make clean.’

In Sls. XII, 15, it is said that ‘in the Spend and Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm the high-priests _have_ taught that the duty and good works which a son performs become as much the father's as though they had been done by his own hand.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (469:1) The short account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains 347 Pahlavi words, which would represent about 20,500 words of Pahlavi version, according to the proportion guessed in the case of Nask XII. But, this being a Gâthic Nask, the proportion of Avesta to Pahlavi ought to be that calculated for the Gâthic Nasks I, II, III, XXI, which would give about 9,900 words of Avesta text for this Nask. The seventh book of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, whose contents are very similar to those attributed to the Spend Nask, contains about 16,000 Pahlavi words.

[^2]: (469:2) A personification of the Av. davãs of Yas. XXXI, 10 c.
