## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER IV.

1\. The Bakŏ [^1] _contains_ particulars about the division of the recital of the first saying of revelation [^2], the first creature [^3] _in_ that saying, the first occurrence of it, the adaptation of the creature, and the greatness _of_ that saying which is incorporating the creature, owing thereto; also, especially, the intermingling of thought (mê<i>d</i>) [^4] with it. 2. Very comprehensive knowledge about everything, each separately its own offspring, and many an appendage as much connected with it as that which is said concerning the Bakŏ [^5], that ‘the Bakŏ of the community (dâhmân) is heard where it is spoken for the community,’ that is, whoever shall do this good work, for him this good work _will_ be done.

3\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.
