1\. The second section is miscellaneous (hamdâ<i>d</i>akŏ): about the authority for the enquiry (khvâst-ra<i>d</i>akîh) of a father into the sin of a grown-up son, when unaware of the sin of his son at the time it is committed; that _of_ a son into that of a father, _and of_ others grown-up, as to one another, when they are not abettors of the sin; and that of a husband into the sin of a wife, when not _and_ when [^2] co-operating and unrestraining. 2. About arrival _at_ the period for the teaching of children by a guardian _or_ father, and the mode of his teaching; the period at which the sin of a child _has_ reached a beginning, the extent of the sin of childhood, the retribution in childhood, and that also at maturity; the sin due to not teaching a child who is to be taught, _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

3\. About the freedom from slaughter which is to <span id="p78"><sup><small>[ p. 78 ]</small></sup></span> keep away the destruction _of_ the world; and what is the mode of distributing the property of a man of the valiant after _his_ slaughter. 4. About the sin of _having_ given implements of slaughter to a woman, a child, _or_ a foreigner. 5. About a woman who, as regards two men worthy of death, demands the head of the one, _and_ is seeking a son in the _other_ one.

6\. About a warrior, without provisions (atû<i>s</i>akŏ), who, on the march, _has_ come upon pasture, corn, and sheep whose shepherd [^1] is a stranger to him, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 7. About considering property inexpedient, and the decision thereon.

8\. About the amount of delay of a judge on _becoming_ aware that the plaintiff is falsely petitioning _and_ the defendant is falsely confessing. 9. About the amount of delay of the judge, and in the court of justice (dâ<i>d</i> gas); and whatever is on the same <span id="p79"><sup><small>[ p. 79 ]</small></sup></span> subject. 10. About a decision regarding a judge who explained a doubtful opinion as a certainty, _and_ that _which_ is certain as a doubtful decision, _and_ would make an undecided _matter_ decided. 11. About the opinion as to certainty and that as to doubtfulness, making a decision, and whatever is on the same subject.

12\. About the business _of_ commissioned judges, from him who is lowest _to_ him who is highest, one above the _other_ one. 13. Decisions about adjudication; that which is legal _when_ two _judges_ are together, that which is legal with _either one_ judge _or_ two judges together, and whatever is on the same subject. 14. About the statements of a decision regarding interpretations (pâ<i>d</i>ŏ-khânânŏ) [^1], _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 15. About the proportion of the time of judges for decision, that for summoning witnesses to the judges, _and_ that for the proceedings (s<i>a</i><i>k</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ). 16. About the judge who is doubly satisfied [^2], _and_ him who is not doubly satisfied; _also_ the time from a judge's not _being_ doubly satisfied till his _being_ doubly satisfied. 17. About a judge of four customs, and _his_ decision thereon; one who knows the decree _and_ would act to effect _it_, and one who knows _it_ and would not act. 18. About the supremacy of a judge as to adjudication so far as _there_ is a false decision therein; how it is when _he is_ at a distance (pavan hâsar), and how it is when he is on the spot; he who is at a <span id="p80"><sup><small>[ p. 80 ]</small></sup></span> distance becomes a superior therein, when he comes back to the _place of_ justice before the end of a Hâsar [^1]. 19. About other false teaching of a judge which is manifest therefrom, _and_ the retribution for the false teaching; the false summoning, false investigation, and false evidence _of_ the complainant (mûst-hômŏnd) _having_ been his own, and a separate atonement unto the afflicted _one has_ to atone for the affair; _it having_ been mitigated by no good work. 20. About the trouble of adjudication to the priestly authorities (ra<i>d</i>ân). 21. About the proficiency _of_ a woman _or_ child who is acquainted with the law [^2], for a judgeship, _being_ above _that of_ a full-grown man unacquainted with the law.

22\. About assisting the want of one's own disciple for a master for the recited law, _and_ the sin due to not assisting, such as that when, wanting assistance, _it_ is allowable _for_ the afflicted _one_ to beg an assistant from foreigners, and according to his petition is the bringing _of_ a foreigner for assistance; _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 23. About the supremacy of Rashnû [^3] the righteous.

24\. About several persons who are _engaged_ in legal proceedings about the keeping _and_ non-division of property not their own, and the decision as regards for whom _one_ has in keeping that property which is not his own. 25. About actions which are not inconsistent and those which are inconsistent. 26. About the decision _of_ a judge of congregational actions.

27\. About the offence which accusers would commit, as regards the law, by means of the law, _it being_ <span id="p81"><sup><small>[ p. 81 ]</small></sup></span> not allowable to commit _it_ with their own hands; also _as regards_ any one's property, about which _there_ is a dispute, even though with a certainty as to its ownership.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (77:2) Perhaps the repetition of the word amat, ‘_and_ when’ is a blunder of the copyist.

[^1]: (78:1) The Pahlavi word is written ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) twenty-four times, and ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) once, in this Book, but its reading is not quite certain. It means ‘shepherd’ throughout Chaps. XXIII, XXXIX, and in XXXI, 17, 31, XL, 3; but is used for ‘herdsman’ in XXXIX, 3, and for ‘follower’ in XXXI, 2. This last meaning is strongly in favour of the reading pasîg, for pasîk, ‘following,’ an adjectival form derived from pas, ‘after,’ which, when used as a noun, would imply ‘one who follows,’ as drovers and shepherds are accustomed to do, with a few local exceptions. The Pahlavi spelling of the word is uniformly inconsistent with the reading pâs, ‘guard, protector;’ and it seems hazardous to trace it to a possible Avesta adjective pasvya, from pasu, ‘a sheep,’ because the latter word becomes pâh in Pahlavi. The word also occurs in Pahl. Vend. XV, 116; it is a transcript of Av. fsh<i>e</i>nghî and fsh<i>e</i>nghyô in Yas. XXXI, 10 b, XLIX, 9 a, and of fshê in Vend. XIII, 10, 11; so that it may perhaps be read fsheg, or fshê, as a mere transcript from the Avesta.

[^1]: (79:1) Pahl. pâ<i>d</i>ŏ-khân = Pers. pâî‘<i>h</i>vân.

[^2]: (79:2) Pâz. vayôzu<i>s</i>t, Av. vayôzu<i>s</i>tô = dvayôzu<i>s</i>tô. Farh. Oîm, p. 43, ll. 10-12, has ‘the Vayôzu<i>s</i>tô, who is a judge, explains this, so that the petitioner who is doubtful is a hearer of certainty; it is, as _one_ says, deliberately weighed.’

[^1]: (80:1) See Chap. XX, 68.

[^2]: (80:2) See Chap. XX, 74.

[^3]: (80:3) See Chap. XX, 153.
