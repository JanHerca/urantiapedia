## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LII.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The sixth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>\-tâ-vakhshyâ [^3], is this, that by him who is a wise upholder of the dignity <span id="p323"><sup><small>[ p. 323 ]</small></sup></span> of a priest's leadership, the priestly assembly [^1] wanted for performing religious rites (dênô) is enlarged; for this reason, because the nature of the person, whose resources are bounty for the needy, eagerly becomes a causer of exertion for the teaching (âmûkŏ) of accomplishments. 2. This, too, that by him whose habits are virtuous the glorification of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^2] is accomplished and taught; even on this account, for the sake of whatever advantage _and_ pleasure are due to virtue, they, indeed, whose habits are virtuous, glorify him, moreover, who is the creator of those virtuous habits, who is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> himself. 3. This, too, that by him who speaks virtuous words the performance even of the worship of Vohûman [^2] is also taught; even on this account, because of the comeliness and desirableness of virtue, the good make it an example and speak virtuous words, _and_ virtuous speaking is the worship of Vohûman. 4. This, too, that the ceremonial which he whose way is virtuous shall accomplish becomes greater [^3] thereby; even for this reason, because the sacred beings come more particularly to the ceremonial of those of pure dispositions _and_ virtuous ways, and accept _it_.

5\. This, too, that he who is a producer of benefit for promoters of good works becomes an extender [^4] of the teaching of religion; even for this reason, because from producing benefit for promoters of good works _arises_ an increase of good works, from an increase of good works _arises_ further progress of the will of the sacred beings, from further progress of the will of the sacred beings _arises_ more progress <span id="p324"><sup><small>[ p. 324 ]</small></sup></span> of the good religion, _and_ from more progress _of_ the good religion arises an extension of the teaching of the good religion in the world. 6. This, too, that by him who possesses authority through virtue, discrimination [^1] as to the regulation of duties is taught to mankind; even for this reason, because the possessor of authority through virtue is a man who becomes a decider _and_ ruler, _and_ mankind learn and practise to exercise the disposition, habits, and custom of rulers.

7\. This, too, that _he_ who is a giver of the needful _to_ his own needy ones has given himself to Zaratû<i>s</i>t; even for this reason, because the needful _being_ given _to_ one's own needy ones is the existence of true liberality, which is a compendium of the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; by him who is thereby ennobled (vâs<i>p</i>ûharakânî-aîtŏ) the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is then put on, and whoever _has_ put on the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t \[has given himself to Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 8. This, too, that by him who\] [^2] gives the leadership \[to him who is suitable for the leadership\] [^2] even the wisdom _of_ that man is increased; for this reason, because even the wisdom of the suitable, through which they accomplish that leadership, when the leadership comes to them, grows further with the glory of that duty.

9\. This, too, that he who _has_ to select the better of two ways, which are good and bad [^3], is assisted <span id="p325"><sup><small>[ p. 325 ]</small></sup></span> to do _so_ by the benefiters’ ordeal of fire and ore; even for this reason, because that is discrimination by the eye of wisdom, which is the way of good intention, _and_ the benefiters are decisive declarers of acquittal and incrimination through fire and metal, the two good discriminators; and when the business _is of_ a different kind, even then both _are_ associates in discriminating, and are powerful connections of one another. 10. This, too, that he who shall do that thing from _which_ advantage of the sacred beings _arises_, is empowered to discriminate truly that which is sagacious [^1] in thought, word, _and_ deed; even for this reason, because from doing anything for the advantage of the sacred beings _arises_ the reign of the will of the sacred beings in the world, from the reign of the will of the sacred beings in the world _arises_ the freedom from danger _of_ the temporal existence of the world, _and_ the freedom from danger of the temporal existence of the world contributes also to the power of him who is sagacious in discriminating truly as to thought, word, _and_ deed.

11\. This, too, that by him who thinks of the affairs of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the eternity (hamâyîkîh) _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^2] and also the consideration of his own eternity _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> are thought of; even on this account, because mankind mind and serve Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> for the sake of even the hope [^2] of eternal benefit from him; _and_ they who think of him, through the eternal benefit due to him, are themselves increasing that benefit which is eternal, and it is thought eternal by him that thinks of that eternal _thing_ his own eternity. 12. This, too, that <span id="p326"><sup><small>[ p. 326 ]</small></sup></span> _he_ who restrains a person from reverence of the demons, has diverted him from making the world sickly; even for this reason, because whoever _has_ restrained a person from reverence of the demons, has diverted a demon from making the world anarchical _and_ from making the world sickly. 13. This, too, that by him who shall practise liberality benefit for the sun is caused, and by him who shall cause benefit for the sun benefit is caused also for the nature of the body of mankind; even for this reason, because _it is_ declared _that_ the sun _has_ progressed through the radiance and glory of the liberal, and the nature of the body of mankind is preserved by the sun.

14\. This, too, that by him whose desire is for anything virtuous, and who possesses authority through virtue, mankind are controlled to persist (mânînî<i>d</i>anŏ) in virtue for receiving a reward [^1]; even for this reason, because _he_ whose desire is virtuous seeks happiness for every one—a pre-eminent desire for the happiness of human existence _being_ the desire of mankind for virtue—and by him who requires that, _and_ strives for _it_ fully, so far as possible for him, any one whatever is brought to persist in virtue and to constrain the spirit for reward; and by him who possesses authority through virtue the continuance of mankind in authority _and their_ persistence _and_ instruction in virtue are attached to good works and are brought to reward. 15. This, too, that by him who possesses happiness through appropriation of the sacred beings mankind are attached to the sacred beings for receiving a reward [^2]; even for this reason, because, on account of the possession of <span id="p327"><sup><small>[ p. 327 ]</small></sup></span> happiness through appropriation of the sacred beings, he possesses _it_ through the assistance and gratification of the good, and mankind shall therefore make him an example; it also becomes a good work for them, _and_ they adhere to the sacred beings for receiving a reward.

16\. This, too, that by him who produces the benediction _of_ him that is a conductor of investigation _and_ a righteous judge, and who shall also occasion the reverence of the good, the teaching of the advantage of the righteous [^1] is likewise performed; even for this reason, because the essentials (mâ<i>d</i>îgân) of the advantage of the world are two—one owing to justice, _and_ one owing to generosity—and it is declared _that_ the advantage of _him_ who possesses the blessings of the judges is owing to the justice of the judges, and the advantage of _him_ who is reverent _to_ the good is owing to the generosity of the good in developing the world, and the righteous teach about _it_.

17\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.
