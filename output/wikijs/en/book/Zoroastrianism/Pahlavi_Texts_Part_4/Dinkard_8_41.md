## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XLI.

_Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm Nask_.

1\. One section of the last twenty-two is the Vakhshistân (‘_increase code_’), particulars about the progress of increase. 2. About atonement, surrender, and compensation _for_ anything, through dispelling _it_ by compensating, atoning, _and_ surrendering to _him_ whose own _it is;_ the period thereof not _being_ appointed. 3. When he, whose origination of compensation, atonement, _and_ surrender is his own, has appointed the period thereof, the growing of the sin actively, after the appointed time, is increase.

4\. About increase [^1] which is active (ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>akŏ), and that which is existent (zîstakŏ); how it is when the existent becomes quite active, and how it is when both are suppressed (armê<i>s</i>tî-aît). 5. About the extraction of increase upon increases which they may occasion _up_ to an equality; where _and_ which _it is_. 6. About a righteous gift; that is, how it is when overwhelmed by impoverishment, _and_ how it is when its increase still proceeds.

7\. About the progress of interest (vakhsh) upon effective wealth, when there is interest for it, and the interest thereon accumulates; also that which does not progress; how it is when the debtor (<i>â</i><i>v</i>âm-hômônd), even on bringing back the wealth, is opulent, _and_ the lender (<i>â</i><i>v</i>âm naf<i>s</i>man) is opulent on asking for _it_; how it is when each is not opulent, _and_ the debtor _was_ not opulent on asking for _it; and_ how it is when the lender (<i>â</i><i>v</i>âm khvê<i>s</i>) <span id="p139"><sup><small>[ p. 139 ]</small></sup></span> is opulent on asking for _it, and_ the debtor is not opulent through the wealth.

8\. About where _and_ when the life (zîstanŏ) of the lender has once passed _away_, how _it is_ when _the loan_ is to be issued anew at the end of the issue (zihî<i>s</i>nŏ), and how it is when _it has_ existed in force, through the one issue _by_ the deceased, _and_ the interest accrues. 9. When the debtor passes away, how it is when he puts the interest into the property of any one through adoption, _and_ how _it is_ when it is the interest of the possessor of the wealth in both worlds.

10\. About the peculiarity _of_ retribution, the self-retribution of _one_ liable to retribution for others, _and_ the limit of one's own retribution. 11. About the penalty (tâvân) of him who, purchasing _animals_ for impregnation, gives each a bad male; when _they are_ not pregnant, _and_ when they may produce; and whatever is on the same subject. 12. About the time of allowing the admission of the male _to_ the beast _of_ burden, sheep, and camel, and the time of consignment _to_ each separate male for whom reception remains; the _case_ when _it is_ the time for admission of the male (gû<i>s</i>n-hilîh), _and_ the _case_ when _it is_ such a consignment as when the period, which is really originating with the admission of the male, has continued. 13. When, on account of no consignment _to_ the male at the _proper_ time, the female goes on unimpregnated, _and there_ is no pregnancy of the cow, mare, camel, sheep, goat, _or_ pig, each separately, how much the penalty is; _also_ the sin they commit.

14\. About the camel, mare, cow, _or_ sheep, unto whom _there_ is damaged milk, void of butter (akarag), owing to the appointed time _one_ postpones; also the <span id="p140"><sup><small>[ p. 140 ]</small></sup></span> average _and_ least milk of the mare, cow, goat, and sheep, that is, the measure of their one milking, each separately. 15. About the camel, that is, how much is its production of hair in a year, _and_ the extent that the camel is surpassing therein among cattle; of them is also the ass that they allow to be seized upon for as much value as that _of_ the oxen, and the mode of beating them up. 16. Where _and_ how it is when the females of the camel and horse are a multiplying (<i>a</i>fzûnŏ) _tending_ to dissatisfaction; the increase even of increases of the ox, sheep, and goat progresses, _and_ of them how much less is the multiplying of the female—which is an increase of increases _tending_ to dissatisfaction, where _it is_ extending over them—to be produced than that of the male.

17\. The camel which is injured _on_ the road, beyond the end of the appointed time, when they keep it _at_ work unlawfully and the road is bad, when _at_ work unlawfully _and_ the road is good, _and_ when comfortable at pasture, where seizing upon it becomes _tending_ to dissatisfaction in several _ways_, and they are severally buying _it_ when really invigorated [^2], or _at_ a price.

18\. For how much increase of increases he stands up who is buying also an invigorated dog, _or_ pig, at a price; and when _it is that_ the increase and increase of increases remain undeveloped in them, as it _does_ whenever property, _on_ which the interest of the residue and income accumulates, is still for the children _of_ the well-destined. <span id="p141"><sup><small>[ p. 141 ]</small></sup></span> 19\. About _him_ whose supplies some one is silently (agôpŏ) buying up, and the seller and important holder is quite bereaved, so that the bereaver _has_ plenty for _one_ deprived of food _on_ a summer's day, and plenty for him who is _so_ also _on_ a winter's _day_ (dim-i<i>k</i>îk); _also_ the supplying of mankind and fire lawfully, in the beginning, for a summer's day and night, _and_ that for a winter's one [^3]. 20. About clothing when _it_ is _that_ which _one_ strips off for donation. 21. About the penalty for a first deprival of food, _and_ the sin of it; _also_ the penalty of the second and third, up to the tenth.

22\. About a plaint and defence as regards a debt and its interest, and the decision thereon; also how _it is_ when, for keeping up the repayment, debts upon debts are cancelled so far as the continuance of interest; _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 23. About the uselessness of supplies which are not authorised _by_ the religion. 24. About buying a slaughtered [^4] sheep when the seller is bereaved by the delivery; _also_ to how many sheep, in the two previous years, the increase and increase of increases thereof _had_ specially to attain. 25. About where _and_ what is that which would not conduce to increase, _and_ what is that which _would_. 26. About the special sin and offence, the use of the milk, heart [^5], and wool, the spreading about _which tends_ to dissatisfaction, the increase of increases, and the good <span id="p142"><sup><small>[ p. 142 ]</small></sup></span> figure of any one sheep, and the regulation of every one.

27\. About how the debtor _has_ to announce the nature of the loan, _which_ the lender, through irritation, does not approve; and, when the debtor has provided for a triple issue, when for a double issue, _and_ even when he has for a single issue, the first year is _free_ from begging his own time. 28. About the debtor _and_ what [^6] he repays, when each year is announced _and_ he does not assent; _and_ how it happens, as regards the debtor, through many repayments, and all the postponements of the lender [^7].

29\. About causing the confiscation (pâ<i>d</i>îrângarîh) of a human being (gerpîh) [^8], and _its_ cessation [^9] owing to worldly work, where _it is_ for one month, _or_, thence onwards, for a second, a third, a sixth, a ninth, _or_ a year at worldly work, _and_ where _it is_ regarding several human beings; the production of gain which accrues upon that single human being; _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 30. About the confiscation of a cloak (gudâd) in the winter, _and of_ a skin-bag for holding water (ma<i>s</i>kŏ-î <i>â</i><i>v</i>dânŏ) in the summer; about whom _they are_ appertaining to, on the passing by of the first ten nights, where _it is_ after the bringing out of the cloak at the beginning of winter, _and of_ the water-skin at the beginning of summer; _or_ prior to the length of a month previous, <span id="p143"><sup><small>[ p. 143 ]</small></sup></span> severally, _to_ the end of the winter _as regards_ the cloak, _and to_ the end of the summer _as regards_ the water-skin; that is, _for_ how much gain upon that one cloak, _or_ water-skin, is the retribution of the confiscator to whom _it is_ appertaining [^10]; _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

31\. About the increase of grains, _and_ that of sheep _with_ the progeny, milk, and wool that they may severally produce. 32. About the confiscation of clothes and implements by delivering _them_ back to _him_ who specially reckons many _as_ his own [^11]; that is, how the produce (vakhsh) increases when he orders _their_ use imperfectly, how it _does_ when _he does so_ not imperfectly, _and_ how it _does_ when he keeps _them_ in inactivity. 33. About the produce of land on which grain is cast, and _of_ that on which _it is_ not cast (va-zak-î an-madam ramîtuntô) [^12], when by delivery thereof _it_ is self-exhausted. 34. And so also the produce _of_ ornaments of gold and silver, and of red-coloured things, with many regulations on the same subject _and_ what is connected therewith.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (138:1) As this word is written vakhs (= nâs) it is doubtful whether vakhsh, ‘increase,’ or vinâs, ‘sin,’ is intended; and the context is insufficient to solve the doubt.

[^2]: (140:1) Pâz. aôsanghen, both here and in § 18, no doubt for Av. aoganghem, as in Chap. XX, 58, the Av. ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) g and ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) s being much alike.

[^3]: (141:1) See Farh. Oîm, p. 38, ll. 4-8, and compare Chap. XXXVIII, 13.

[^4]: (141:2) Reading ba<i>r</i>â-zegtalûntakŏ, which word has been corrupted by the repairer of the MS.

[^5]: (141:3) Reading dîl, but the word can also be read sar, ‘head.’

[^6]: (142:1) Supposing that madam stands for maman; the two words being sometimes confounded.

[^7]: (142:2) Who allows the debtor a longer time for repayment.

[^8]: (142:3) Literally ‘bodily form.’ The seizure of a slave of the debtor to work off the amount of the debt is evidently meant.

[^9]: (142:4) Reading va-s<i>a</i><i>k</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ instead of the very similarly-written nik<i>ê</i><i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘explanation,’ of the MS.

[^10]: (143:1) This seems the more probable meaning if we are to understand that the confiscation has been actually carried out at an improper season; but, if we suppose that it is avoided on account of the season, it would be better to translate as follows:—‘_For_ how much gain upon that one cloak, _or_ water-skin, is the confiscator, to whom _it is_ appertaining, to be compensated.’

[^11]: (143:2) Possibly referring to the seizure of articles sold by a dealer, but not paid for.

[^12]: (143:3) The form an of the negative prefix is here used because the Zvâri<i>s</i> an-madam is replaced by the Pâz. an-<i>a</i><i>v</i>ar in pronunciation.
