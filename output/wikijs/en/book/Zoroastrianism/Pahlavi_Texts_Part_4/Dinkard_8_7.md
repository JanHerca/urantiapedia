## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER VII.

1\. The Pâ<i>g</i>ag [^1] _contains_ particulars about lawfully slaughtering a sheep, for the ceremonial of fires, waters, _and_ holy-water, in aid of a season-festival [^2] _of_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers; besides this, namely, in what are the skill, and the means for selection, of a man for such work, and the formula (nîrang) of the ceremony. 2. And this, namely, from which limb of the sheep species is the <span id="p16"><sup><small>[ p. 16 ]</small></sup></span> share _of_ the fires and waters to be taken [^3], _and_ how is the preparation which is to be carried on, _and_ with what Avesta. 3. And whatever is about a season-festival; where the appointed place is, when one celebrates _it, and_ when it has fully elapsed; the assembly of the season-festival, and the donation for the feast; where and when the celebration is possible, in what proportion the provisions are to be given out, _and_ when to be prepared _and_ divided; where its advantage is, _and_ what benefit _there_ is from it to the good creations both spiritually and materially.

4\. And this, namely, what skill is more suitable for the sacerdotal (ra<i>d</i>\-pî<i>s</i>ag) leadership _and_ other priestly authority (ra<i>d</i>îh) each separately. 5. About the business _of_ the sacerdotal leadership, where _it is_ owing to _having_ appointed the place and _having_ gone forth to the assembly of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, _and_ when _they are_ to be made aware that that assembly is more particularly for the arrangement of renunciation of vice and retribution for sin; the needful supply of things for the feast; the selection of the men for the Zôti duty _and_ Râspî duty before the day [^4]; the Zôtis, Râspîs, and others who put in action the work for the preparation _and_ giving of the portions; _and_ the cleansing of the body-clothing. 6. _As to_ the selection _of_ the president (pê<i>s</i>\-gâs) of the feast _there_ is this, namely, what ability is requisite for that presidentship. 7. The allotment of the portions, and giving _them_ sooner to _those_ who are sooner in need _of them_. 8. Scoffing before <span id="p17"><sup><small>[ p. 17 ]</small></sup></span> priestly authorities, _who are_ great _and_ good, _and_ when they do not give a portion to the authorities are _cases when_ the season-festivals are not to be considered as celebrated. 9. This, too, that the Zôtis and Râspîs are for the Zôti duty _and_ Râspî duty, _and_ the other priestly authorities for the control of sin and computation (<i>â</i><i>v</i>âr) of the portions; and more on the same subject.

10\. About the rotation of the day-watches (gâs), days, months, and seasons of the year—which are when _it_ is summer _and_ winter—and the appearances (sahî<i>s</i>nŏ) therein which are owing to the motion of the constellations [^5]. 11. Where the coming of the righteous guardian spirits (fravâhar) into the worldly _existence occurs_, in those ten days which are the end of the winter _and_ termination of the year, because the five Gâthic days [^6], among them, are for that purpose; the cessation of that same, as well as its continuance. 12. The great needfulness _of_ the guardian spirits of the righteous in the ceremonial _and_ obeisance of those ten days, _and_ their abundant gratification therefrom; their vexation from <span id="p18"><sup><small>[ p. 18 ]</small></sup></span> want of welcome and want of obeisance; and _their_ ascent from the worldly existences. 13. The extreme importance (fr<i>ê</i><i>v</i>ŏânîkîh) _of_ liberality and bounty at that season; and the proper duty _of_ the priestly authority of a district (shat<i>r</i>ô) in assisting and interceding for the poor, for the sake of teaching, from the days devoted to the guardian spirits, _proper_ actions among those having guardian spit its.

14\. About the period for taking medicinal plants, and whatever is on the same subject. 15. About where _there_ is a household, village, communal, _or_ provincial petitioning _for_ the royal chastisement _of_ sins affecting the soul, each separately; _and_ for whom is the atonement. 16. About the advantage owing to disposal of sin and infliction of chastisement, and the harm owing to not disposing of sin and neglecting the chastisement inflicted.

17\. About the first thirty-three chieftainships (ra<i>d</i>îh), around _and_ concealed; that is, which _and_ how many are spiritual, _and_ how many worldly; and which is the second, and which the third, of the spiritual _and_ worldly _existences_. 18. About the admirableness and great meritoriousness _of_ public observances, and the awfulness and grievous sinfulness _of_ apostasy. 19. And also this, that is, when any one is doubtful, through apostasy, which is the law from the sacred beings in elucidation, and which of the sacred beings is to be entreated for assistance. 20. About this, namely, _for_ which of the women the bringing of a handful of anything, from the property _of her_ husband, _to be_ given away is allowable, in what proportion, and how, _and_ for whom; and for whom, when she gives _it_ away, _it_ is allowable _for_ the husband to bring _it_ back. <span id="p19"><sup><small>[ p. 19 ]</small></sup></span> 21\. About this, namely, when summer comes on, where does winter run to; and when winter comes on, where does summer go to? 22. About the amount of disaster [^7] _that_ has passed by in one century, and the duration of _its_ passing; everything which is connected with the disaster, and whatever is on the same subject. 23. Where _and_ how many months are of such a kind [^8] _and_ how many of such a kind [^8]; as well as the religious names of the twelve months, and the reason of the name of each one of them, that is, to which of the sacred beings, in the ceremonial, each one of these twelve months is predominantly appertaining; so also of the thirty days which are in every month, and so also of the five Gâthas in every _year_—that is, the five Gâthic days at the end of the year [^9]—all the sacred beings _to whom they are_ appertaining, and when the righteous guardian spirits (ar<i>d</i>âî fravar<i>d</i>ŏ) are reverenced.

24\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (15:2) Corresponding to the sixth word, ashâ<i>d</i>, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the seventh Nask in other Rivâyats. Pâ<i>g</i>ag probably means ‘cooking,’ with reference to the preparations for the sacred feasts; it is called Pâ<i>g</i>am, Pâ<i>k</i>am, or Pâzûn in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained twenty-two kardah, or subdivisions.

[^2]: (15:3) The six Gâhanbârs or season-festivals are held on the five days ending, respectively, with the 45th, 105th, 180th, 210th, 290th, and 365th days of the Parsi year (see Sls. XVIII, 3 n).

[^3]: (16:1) The heart for the fires, and the fore-legs for the waters, according to Sls. XI, 4.

[^4]: (16:2) The Zôti is the chief officiating priest in the ceremonial, and the Râspî is the assistant priest.

[^5]: (17:1) That is, the _apparent_ motions of the akhtarân, or signs of the zodiac.

[^6]: (17:2) The five supplementary days, named after the five Gâthas, which are added to the twelfth month of thirty days to complete the 365 days of the year. They are also called fravar<i>d</i>îkân, or ‘those devoted to the Fravar<i>d</i>s,’ or Fravashis, the guardian spirits, or prototypes, of created beings, who are supposed to revisit their old haunts on earth during those days. The last five days of the twelfth month are also considered a part of the same festival of ten days, which would have terminated at the vernal equinox, as indicated in the text, about A.D. 1000 if the ordinary receding calendar of the Irânian Parsis were used; but it seems probable, from Bd. XXV, that the calendar in those times was fixed for the new year to begin at the vernal equinox.

[^7]: (19:1) Pâz. vôighn.

[^8]: (19:2) Reading hamgûn in both places; but the two words may be hamînô, ‘summer,’ and khamînô, ‘wet weather.’

[^9]: (19:3) The five supplementary days mentioned in § 11.
