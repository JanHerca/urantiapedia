## EXTANT FRAGMENTS. XVII. HÛSPÂRAM NASK [^1].

A small portion of this Nask is still preserved and known by the name of Nîrangistân. The last seven-eighths of this text corresponds with the description of the Nîrangistân section of the Hûspâram,  given in Dk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 1-17, although a few folios of its commencement are probably lost. And <span id="p477"><sup><small>[ p. 477 ]</small></sup></span> the earlier portion of the text begins with a fragment of a passage; which appears to correspond with part of the description of the Aêrpatistân section, given in Chap. XXVIII, 1; but also contains passages that are difficult to trace in any part of that description. The Nîrangistân portion of this text is divided into three fargar<i>d</i>s, and Dd. LXVI, 1 mentions ‘five fargar<i>d</i>s _of_ the Avesta of the correct law of the Nîrangistân, _which are_ easy through the Zand;’ so that the missing portion of this section of the Nask, described in Chap. XXIX, 18-25, must have contained two fargar<i>d</i>s. With regard to the unidentified passages, preceding the Nîrangistân portion of the extant text, it may be remarked that they include several of the statements about ‘unseasonable chatter’ contained in Sls. V, 3-6, where they are differently arranged.

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 2, refers to a passage which may have contained the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XII, I:—‘Of the merit of a threefold _consecration of the_ sacred cake the high-priests _have_ specially taught in the Hûspâram that _it is_ as much as _that of_ a lesser _form of_ worship.’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 8, refers to the passage which probably contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. XII, 31:—‘Of the ceremonies which go to the bridge _as sin_ it says this in the Hûspâram, that _they are_ the non-celebration of the rites of the season-festivals, the Rapît<i>v</i>în, the three nights _after a death, the days of_ the guardian spirits, and the sun. and moon.’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXII, 1, refers to the passage which must have contained the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XIII, 17:—‘The six hot ordeals <span id="p478"><sup><small>[ p. 478 ]</small></sup></span> which, in the Hûspâram, are effected by <i>k</i>athrayâim âthraiãm [^2].’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXIII, 4, refers to the passage which must have contained the statement thus mentioned in Pahl. Vend. XV, 67:—‘What is as to the sick _dog in_ the Hûspâram is, “_when_ several doors are together, _it is_ just _if_ the nourishment _at_ each one _be_ only _for_ three nights, and then, when opulence is manifest, the delivery _be_ unto that opulent _one_, and when not, the delivery _be_ unto him _who is_ good.”’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXV, 2, probably refers to the passage which contained the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XII, 7:—‘In the twentieth [^3] of the Hûspâram it is shown _that_ over the soul of him who works in the dark _there is_ more predominance of the evil spirit.’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVI, 7, or 13, probably refers to the passage thus mentioned in Dd. LXI, 3:—'Nearer details of the family guardianship which is proper _and_ which is not proper for an adopted son's duty, of the child of the good religion with whose business _it_ is connected, _and_ of the fathers for whom a family guardian is to be appointed, are _in_ the recital of five fargar<i>d</i>s [^4] of the Hûspâram.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVI, 8-12, probably refers to the passage which contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. X, 21, XII, 14:—‘In the fourteenth [^5] <span id="p479"><sup><small>[ p. 479 ]</small></sup></span> of the Hûspâram Nask the high-priests _have_ taught thus: “My son is suitable even _as_ thy son, _but_ my daughter is not suitable even _as_ thy daughter.”’

No allusion has been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chaps. XXVIII-XXXVII, to the two passages in Pahl. Vend. IV, 35, V, 73, referring to this Nask, which have been already quoted as also referring to Nask XV.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (476:3) As the 212 Pahlavi words in Dk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 1-17, represent about 2,722 words of the original Avesta text of this Nask, with 24,472 of its Pahlavi version, it may be fairly assumed that the 3,496 Pahlavi words of the whole account of the Nask in Chaps. XXVIII-XXXVII, must represent about 44,900 Avesta and 403,600 Pahlavi words of original text. And the same proportion probably holds good with regard to the other Legal Nasks, XV, XVI, XVIII, of which very long accounts are given.

[^2]: (478:1) This corrupt Avesta means probably ‘fourfold fire.’

[^3]: (478:2) The first section mentioned of these twenty is that described in Chap. XXXII.

[^4]: (478:3) See Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVI, 1 n.

[^5]: (478:4) That is, in one of the last fourteen sections of the Nask. If it were not for this number, and the fact that the passage is understood to apply to the children of a concubine, it might be connected with Chap. XXXIV, 4, 5.
