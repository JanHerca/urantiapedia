## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXII.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The twenty-first fargar<i>d</i>, Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti [^1], is about where the best prayers [^2] of the good religion _are:_ unto Mit<i>r</i>ô [^3] once every night for dismissing and lessening Wrath _in_ the whole world, _and_ a second time _for doing so with_ Lethargy; a third _unto_ Srôsh [^4] the righteous, and the fourth is the Dâhmân _Â<i>f</i>rî_n [^5] for further gifts and increasing gifts; and the most <span id="p220"><sup><small>[ p. 220 ]</small></sup></span> preservative of them was the Dâhmân _Â<i>f</i>rî_n. 2. And this, too, that the most admirable of shapes of women _was_ Hûmâî [^6] of the noble family of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, of horses the splendid horse of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, of oxen the male ox Barmâyûn [^7], of sheep the very much celebrated [^8] sheep that is fat, white-jawed, _and_ star-spotted, _with its_ upper half in a manufacture (pa<i>s</i>akhtakŏ) embroidered with gold and the topmost part yellow; and yet not one of them attains an equality to even a single thousandth _part_ of the glory of a righteous man, a member of the community, by whom the Dâhmân _Â<i>f</i>rî_n of the good _is uttered_. 3. And this, too, as much as _its_ goodness for the man and _his_ wife is _its_ evil _for_ a villain and _his_ paramour [^9].

4\. About the exercise of sovereignty _by_ Kâî-Ûs [^10], with triumph, over the earth of seven _regions;_ the advancement of his commands, by the people of the creation [^11], more swiftly than a wave of the hands; the construction of his seven dwellings (mân) [^12] in the midst of Albûr’<i>z</i> [^13], one of gold, two of silver, two <span id="p221"><sup><small>[ p. 221 ]</small></sup></span> of steel, and two of crystal (<i>â</i><i>v</i>gînakînŏ); the restraining of the many Mâzônîk demons [^14] who are the ruin of the world, and confining _them_ to their own duty; the arrival at those dwellings of his, and the swift winding (v<i>â</i>fînî<i>d</i>anŏ) around those dwellings, of a person whose strength is overpowered by decrepitude, and the approach of _whose_ life to departure from the body _has_ taken place; the reduction (khûsânî-hastanŏ) of the decrepitude thereby, and the return of his strength and manhood, that is, a command is given by him thus: ‘Keep no people away at the door!’ and he might make a domestic of fifteen years _of age_.

5\. Afterwards, the consultation of the demons about the death of Kâî-Ûs, and the coming of Aeshm [^15] to Kâî-Ûs, approving his death, and, therefore, making _him_ wretched in his mind _about_ the great sovereignty which _was_ possessed by him over the seven lands, and causing him to long for the sovereignty _of_ the heavenly region (asâmânŏ gâs) of the archangels [^16]. 6. And, owing to the seductiveness of Aeshm, and the other demons who remained his co-operators for that undoing, Kâî-Ûs _was_ even _engaged_ in opposing and molesting the sacred beings. 7. Also his not returning across Albûr’<i>z</i>, _but_ rushing upwards, with many demons and wicked people, unto the _outer_ edge of darkness [^17]; <span id="p222"><sup><small>[ p. 222 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ the reason _of_ the glory of the Kayâns [^18] becoming a figure of clay on that border. 8. The previous separation (madam rê<i>g</i>î-hastanŏ) of Kâî-Ûs from the troops, and _his_ not turning from that ill-advisedness even on renewed strife aloft [^19] _with_ the supreme sacred beings. 9. Afterwards, the creator's calling back the glory of the Kayâns to himself, the falling of the troops of Kâî-Ûs to the earth from that height, and the flying of Kâî-Ûs to the wide-formed ocean [^20].

10\. This, too, it says, that, besides him, some one [^21] flew behind him, thus associated with him; _and_ after him flew Nêryôsang [^22], the promoter (frê<i>h</i>\-dâ<i>d</i>âr) of the world, for diverting that person _from_ him. 11. And the cry of him, the unborn Khûsrôî, who _was_ thus associated with him, like that of a regiment (s<i>i</i>pâh) a thousand _strong, was_ thus: ‘Thou shouldst not smite him, <i>O</i> Nêryôsang, promoter _of_ the world! for if thou shouldst smite this man, <i>O</i> Nêryôsang, promoter _of_ the world! _there will_ not be afterwards obtained, for acquirement, a <span id="p223"><sup><small>[ p. 223 ]</small></sup></span> thorough destroyer _of_ the high-priest of Tûrân [^23]; because owing to this man _will_ be born _him whose_ name is Sîyâvakhsh [^24], and owing to Sîyâvakhsh I _shall_ be born, who am the Khûsrôî who _will_ entice the most heroic [^25] _one_ of Tûrân—who is mostly the destruction of champions and troops—to the numerous heroes of the religion, so that I _may_ accomplish the destruction of his champions and troops, when [^26] I would occasion a distant flight of the sovereign of Tûrân.’ 12. Through these words the guardian spirit of Khûsrôî delighted Nêryôsang, the promoter _of_ the world; and, on these words, _the latter was_ releasing him and that Kâî-Ûs who thereby became discreet.

13\. Perfect is the excellence _of_ righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (219:3) The appellation of the fifth Gâtha (Yas. LIII) which begins with the words vahi<i>s</i>tâ î<i>s</i>ti<i>s</i>; it is here written vahi<i>s</i>tôk-î<i>s</i>tŏ in Pahlavi.

[^2]: (219:4) The Pahlavi explanation of Av. vahi<i>s</i>tâ î<i>s</i>ti<i>s</i>.

[^3]: (219:5) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XLIV, 16.

[^4]: (219:6) See Bk. VIII, Chap. IX, 3.

[^5]: (219:7) ‘The blessing of members of the community.’ The Dahmân Âfrînagân consists of Yas. LX, 2-7 with Âf. I, 14-18; but the Âf_rî_n is another formula, otherwise called ‘the Âf_rî_n of the seven Ameshâspends,’ and it is uncertain which of the two is meant here.

[^6]: (220:1) Av. (gen.) Humay<i>a</i>u of Yt. XIII, 139.

[^7]: (220:2) See Chap. XXI, 22.

[^8]: (220:3) Reading frêh-ôkhtar (for frêh-ôkhttar), as Bd. XXIV, 3 states that ‘the black sheep which is fat and white-jawed is the chief of sheep.’ It might be ‘the sheep of Frashôkhtar,’ and this name might be a miswriting of Frashô<i>s</i>tar, but we have no record of any such sheep of his.

[^9]: (220:4) It is easy to trace a connection between §§ 1, 2 and Yas. LIII, 1, and between § 3 and the Pahl. version of Yas. LIII, 6 a.

[^10]: (220:5) Av. Kava Usa (see Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 13).

[^11]: (220:6) K has ‘by demons and men.’

[^12]: (220:7) Probably the origin of the legends of the seven halting-places of Rustam and Isfendiyâr in the Shâhnâmah.

[^13]: (220:8) Here meaning the mountain-range south of the Caspian (see Chap. XX, 3).

[^14]: (221:1) Av. Mâzainya daêva, the idolators of Mâzendarân.

[^15]: (221:2) The demon of wrath (see Bk. VIII, Chap. IX, 3 n).

[^16]: (221:3) §§ 5-9 are evidently a summary of the original form of the legend of Kâvûs's attempt to reach the sky, otherwise described in the Shâhnâmah.

[^17]: (221:4) Where the endless light commences. Reading par-i tom; or it might be ‘to the utmost,’ if we read frêtum as equivalent to frêhtûm.

[^18]: (222:1) K omits ‘of the Kayâns.’ It is the royal glory of Yt. XIX, which descended from heaven and accompanies the faithful rulers and champions of the religion, successively (see Chap. XXIV, 3).

[^19]: (222:2) B has ‘pitying strife;’ khv<i>â</i>parîk being written instead of <i>a</i><i>v</i>arîk.

[^20]: (222:3) Meaning the Caspian, as in Chap. XXI, 17.

[^21]: (222:4) It will be seen, from what follows, that this was the fravashi, or guardian spirit, of his future grandson, Kaî-Khûsrôî. Every being and object belonging to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s creation is supposed to have its spiritual representative, created before the universe and perpetually existing (see Bd. I, 8; Mkh. XLIX, 23).

[^22]: (222:5) Av. Nairyôsangha, an angel who is supposed to be the usual messenger of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to mankind (see Byt. III, 25, 26, 59, 60). K has only ‘besides him _and_ behind him flew Nêryôsang.’

[^23]: (223:1) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 15.

[^24]: (223:2) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 14.

[^25]: (223:3) A single particular hero appears to be meant, although this is not quite certain.

[^26]: (223:4) Assuming that mûn, ‘who,’ stands for amat, as in Chap. XIII, 2.
