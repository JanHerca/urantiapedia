## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XI.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The tenth fargar<i>d</i>, Yâ-<i>s</i><i>h</i>yaothanâ [^1], is about the complaint of the spirit of fires to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> owing to seven descriptions of people. 2. First, owing to domestics considering _it_ as contemptible and _in_ an unresisting state (a<i>g</i>angîh), molesting _it_ immoderately, and making use of it with unwashed hands; also the damsel who _has_ introduced fire into the sole of _her_ foot, and the bursting of the blister (âvilag); and a weapon brought out into _its_ splendour. Second, the complaint owing to the carriers of fire from that abode \[where the provision of care for fire is as a law to them, to that abode\] [^2] where the provision of care for fire is not as a law to them. 4. And there, owing to the arrival and preparation of the demons, it lay stupefied, like a powerful youth _who is_ feverish and in a languid state; and its cure from that sickness (ayôyakîh) was by bringing forward to it their pure sandalwood, or benzoin, or aloe-wood, or pomegranate [^3], or <span id="p187"><sup><small>[ p. 187 ]</small></sup></span> whatever _there_ was of the most odoriferous of plants. 5. Third, the complaint owing to the hussy [^1] unto whom it happens, through menstruation, _that_ the stench and filth owing to the menstruation is brought to it (_the fire_); and _its_ sickness and stupefaction owing thereto are as written above. 6. Fourth, the complaint owing to the hussy who, dropping _her_ knee on to the fire-stand, arranged _her_ curls; the falling of damp and moisture from _her_ head, with the hair and filth therefrom, into the fire; the consumption _of it_ discontentedly, _and_ the sickness and stupefaction owing thereto. 7. Fifth, the complaint owing to the father, _or_ guardian, of a child for not keeping the child away from the fire; and the bodily refuse and other unlawfulness that come upon it from such children. 8. Sixth, the complaint owing to the adversity which the unpurified infidel (agdênô) may bring upon it, by blowing the breath of _his_ mouth upon it in directing _its_ use, _and_ it becomes incalculable. 9. Seventh, the complaint—which, _one_ says, is more awful and more grievous—owing to those who use it as an ordeal for a falsehood, and, when it is made evident thereby as to the acquitted and convicted, they become of a different opinion about it.

10\. At the place of complaint that which is polluted is put forward together with that which is pure, and the increase of it (_the fire_) is through lawful and unlawful operation; _its_ burning alone <span id="p188"><sup><small>[ p. 188 ]</small></sup></span> and increasing are such as when both would be as a necessity for it, and undesired and rapid burning and increasing [^1] are those which are polluted by burning _and_ insatiably consuming; and in that which is an operation unlawfully—the burning alone _and_ increasing _being_ \[such as when\] [^2] both would be as a necessity \[for it\]—the increase is troubled.

11\. This, too, he [^3] says: ‘I am not _of the world_ here, and from here I _will_ extricate _myself_, from the earth up to the sky; I am also thy son [^4], more to thee [^5] than any of the other creatures.’ 12. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to him thus: ‘So thou shouldst stand over the fire, in thy proper duty as \[a spirit [^6]\], carrying that club; \[it is a substantial means, because I produce it, through which\] thou turnest off \[the whole bodily existence\], some to the endless light, and some to the endless darkness.’

13\. This, too, that _he_ who shall provide care for, fire has paid the greatest reverence unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 14. The propitiation of the righteous is the best _thing_, and their vexation is the worst; when pleased they favour one, _and it is_ the law of the sacred beings that they promote; \[when vexed they wound, _and it_ is the demon that they restrict.

15\. It is righteousness _that is_ perfect excellence.\] [^6]

## Footnotes

[^1]: (186:1) The first two words of the seventh, and last, hâ of the first Gâtha (Yas. XXXIV, 1), here written yâ-shyâôsnŏ in Pahlavi in both MSS. This fargar<i>d</i> may perhaps be considered as a homily upon Yas. XXXIV, 4.

[^2]: (186:2) The words in brackets are omitted in B by mistake.

[^3]: (186:3) The traditional equivalents of the four sweet-scented vegetable substances, Av. urvâsna, vohû-gaona, vohû-kereti, and hadhâ-naêpata, which are mentioned in Vend. VIII, 2, 79, IX, 32, XIV, 3, p. 187 XVIII, 71 as acceptable fuel for the sacred fire, or scent for fumigation; their Pahlavi names are merely corruptions of these Avesta words.

[^1]: (187:1) The word <i>g</i>êh, ‘courtezan,’ is used here and in § 6 merely as a general opprobrious term for a woman.

[^1]: (188:1) As in the case of a destructive conflagration.

[^2]: (188:2) The words in brackets are supplied by guess, to fill up a blank space left by the repairer of B on one of his patches. In K the passage is shorter, and stands as follows:—‘and in that which is unlawful operation _it is_ troubled by the increase.’

[^3]: (188:3) The spirit of fires mentioned in § 1. This dialogue seems to be a quotation from the original Pahlavi version of the Nask.

[^4]: (188:4) Fire being called ‘the son of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.’

[^5]: (188:5) Both MSS. have ‘me’ by mistake.

[^6]: (188:6) The passages in brackets are omitted in B, evidently by mistake.
