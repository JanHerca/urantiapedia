## Footnotes

[^1]: (44:1) Pahl. aharûbŏkîh (= Av. ashavagha) must not be confounded with aharûbŏîh, ‘righteousness,’ for which aharâyîh is more commonly used.

[^2]: (44:2) These two kinds of injury, usually written bâîô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i>ŏ and kâîtyôk-<i>g</i>a<i>d</i>ŏ in the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, are mentioned in Farh. Oîm, pp. 32, l. 8-34, l. 2, as follows:—‘_Av_. baodha<i>g</i>a<i>d</i> = _Pahl_. bô<i>d</i>ô-zê<i>d</i> _and_ _Av_. baodhô-var<i>s</i>tahê = _Pahl_. bô<i>d</i>ôk-var<i>s</i>t are as _it were_ “observantly assaulted,” and _one_ mentions _them_ most about the assault and injury of anything which is noticeable. Through falsehood other noticeable sin is small, _and_ is subdued through _being_ devoid of an injurer, as the assault _and_ injury of anything through wear is a small sin. Kâîtyô-ge<i>d</i> is a sin for mankind, which is a degree of Bô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i>, _but_ less; so also the decree (dastînak) is different from Bô<i>d</i>ôk-var<i>s</i>t. The principal Bô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i>, that of animals with observance, the Bô<i>d</i>ôk-zê<i>d</i> through wear, _and_ the Kâîtyôk-zê<i>d</i> sin towards people are sins which are hamêmâlân (“affecting accusers”). The dissipating weapon for sin dissipates the sinfulness of the other sin, which is called rûbânîk (“affecting the soul”).’

[^3]: (44:3) These two terms are âgêreptŏ and avôîri<i>s</i>tŏ (Av. âgereptem and avaoiri<i>s</i>tem) which are thus described in Farh. Oîm, p. 36, ll. 4-6: ‘âgerept, “seized,” is that when they shall take up a weapon for smiting an innocent _person_; avoîri<i>s</i>t, “turning,” is that when _one_ turns the weapon upon an innocent _person_.’

[^4]: (44:4) See Chap. XVII, 6, for some of these terms.

[^5]: (44:5) Pahl. handerêtŏ which is thus described in Farh. Oîm, pp. 34, l. 8-35, l. 1: ‘_Av_. ha<i>n</i>dereiti, _Pahl_. handeretŏ, is that when, owing to negligence, _one_ keeps any one exhausted; when _one_ would make him fallen who is of the ruined, or him who is a master of arms, and _has_ imprisoned him, the causing of much anguish thereby is the committal of incarceration.’ See also § 44.

[^6]: (45:1) Pâz. knîn (= knûn).

[^7]: (45:2) Of which the details are not mentioned.

[^8]: (45:3) Pahl. hîkhar (Av. hikhra) is any refuse or dirt from the living body, or any liquid exudation from a corpse.

[^9]: (47:1) Doubtful: the word can be read freh-gasîgân on its first occurrence, and freh-ga<i>s</i>îgânŏ on its last; but both reading and meaning are very uncertain.

[^10]: (48:1) It might be ‘inevitability,’ but this would render the ordeal unnecessary.

[^11]: (49:1) The fact of the wound being sufficient to prove the unlawfulness of using the weapon.

[^12]: (49:2) According to Vend. IV, 35, if a man wounds another so that the blood comes, and does this for the _fourth_ time, he becomes an outcast and receives the maximum punishment. Also, when a person walks without the sacred girdle or shirt (Vend. XVIII, 59), it is at the _fourth_ step that the demons possess him.

[^13]: (50:1) See Chap. XVII, 6.

[^14]: (50:2) Pahl. Av. as<i>p</i>erenô (=Pahl. anas<i>p</i>ôrîk) ‘imperfect, immature;’ an epithet for a lamb or kid.

[^15]: (50:3) Pahl. anûmôyê (Av. anumaya), probably ‘bleater,’ an epithet for a sheep or goat.

[^16]: (50:4) These four grades of value are mentioned in Vend. IV, 48.

[^17]: (50:5) See § 1.

[^18]: (51:1) A Hâsar (Av. hâthra) is a measure of distance, as well as of time. This is stated in Farh. Oîm, pp. 41, l. 11-42, l. 3, thus:—‘Of the Hâsar there are also several kinds that express measurement. A medium Hâsar on the ground, which they call also a Parasang, is a thousand steps of two feet which have to walk. With the lapse of time of a medium Hâsar the day and night are computed.’ Again, p. 43, ll. 1-3 state that ‘of twelve Hâsars is the longest day; that day and night in which is the longest day are twelve of the longest Hâsars, eighteen of the medium, and twenty-four of the least.’ From this it appears that an average Hâsar of distance is a thousand paces, or Roman mile; and an average Hâsar of time is one hour and twenty minutes.

[^19]: (52:1) Possibly hûmat, hûkht, hûvarst, ‘good thoughts, good words, and good deeds,’ which would be accepted as a sign of repentance.
