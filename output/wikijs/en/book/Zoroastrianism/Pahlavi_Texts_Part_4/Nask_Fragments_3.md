## EXTANT FRAGMENTS. III. BAKÖ NASK [^1].

Dk. IX, Chaps. X LVII-XLIX, describe the contents of the first three fargar<i>d</i>s of this Nask, which are still extant in the Avesta text of Yas. XIX—XXI, whose Pahlavi version may be translated as follows:—

### Pahl. Yas. XIX = Bakŏ I.

The beginning of the Ahunavair of the Bakân [^2].

1\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: 'O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, [^3] propitious spirit, creator of the world of embodied existences, _and_ righteous [^4]! (2) which were those words, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! that _were_ spoken by thee for me, (3) before the sky, before the water, before the earth, before the (well-yielding) cattle, before the plants, before the fire which is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s <span id="p454"><sup><small>[ p. 454 ]</small></sup></span> son, before the righteous man (Gâyômar<i>d</i>), before the demons, (who remain) noxious creatures [^5], and mankind, before, all embodied existence (the creation of sovereignty), _and_ before all the excellence created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (which is owing to) the manifestation of righteousness?'

4\. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘They were the apportionment of the Ahunavair, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! (that spirit who would make the religion current, who has formed that religion from the Ahunavair) which was spoken out by me for thee; (5) (that is,) before the sky, (_&c., as in_ § 3).

6\. ‘Whoever chants that apportionment of the Ahunavair, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! without talking (that is, he does not speak out in the middle of any of its difficult Avesta [^6]) _and_ not without anxiety (that he _may_ slumber), (7) _it is_ like a hundred above any other authority of those of the Gâthas, when _one_ chants _them_ without talking, _or_ not without anxiety [^7]; (thus it becomes _fit_ for the ceremonial). 8. Whoever chants _it_ while talking, _or_ without anxiety, (thus it becomes _fit_ for the ceremonial,) _it is_ like ten above any other authority of those of the Gâthas.

9\. ‘Whoever in that embodied existence of mine, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! recalls the apportionment of <span id="p455"><sup><small>[ p. 455 ]</small></sup></span> the Ahunavair, (that is, seeks for _it_,) and, further, mutters that which he recalls, (that is, shall accomplish _it_ easily,) and, further, chants that which he mutters, (that is, fully understands its ritual,) and, further, reverences that which is chanted, (that is, shall celebrate the ceremony,) (10) his soul I pass on to the best existence, three times over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, I who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that is, on that day _in_ which he shall faithfully  [^8] provide the ceremony, it shall [^9] lead his soul three times unto _the world_ yonder, and shall [^9] cause its happiness therein) (11) to the best existence, the best righteousness, and the best light. 12. Also whoever in that embodied existence of mine, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! mutters the apportionment of the Ahunavair, (that is, shall accomplish _it_ easily,) _and_ drops [^10], (that is, cuts off [^11]) (13) either [^12] as much as a half, or as much as a third, or as much as a fourth, or as much as a fifth, (at a fifth the foundation _of the sin_ is laid, at a half it becomes quite complete, and when he shall cut off the whole _it is_ a Tanâpûhar [^13] _sin_,) (14) I twirl [^14] away the soul of him, I who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, from the best existence, (that is, I. would put it out;) (15) to such an extent and width is the twirling away as _that of_ this earth, _and_ even so the extent of this earth is as much as its width.’

16\. This saying is proclaimed (a revelation) possessing <span id="p456"><sup><small>[ p. 456 ]</small></sup></span> an Ahu _and_ possessing a Ratu, (from which this is manifest, namely, the possession of a ruler and high-priest. 17. This, too, is said, that it was) before that sky _was_ created, before the water, before the earth, before the plants, (18) before the creation of the four-legged ox (which _was_ the sole-created ox), (19) before the creation of the two-legged righteous man (who _was_ Gâyômar<i>d</i>), (20) _and_ before that sun of definite form (the body of the sun) _was_ created as an acquirement of the archangels. 21. It _was_ (likewise) proclaimed to me by the spirituality of propitiousness, (it likewise became possible for the spirituality of propitiousness to say (22) _what was_ said [^15] to Zaratû<i>s</i>t,) concerning the whole material existence of the righteous who are, who have been, and who _will_ arise, (23) as to the progress of work, (that is, while they shall perform for it that which is specified by it, and good works shall arise through them,) _that_ this work, among the living, is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that is, that which they may perform, suitable for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, they shall so perform as is declared by this fargar<i>d</i>).

24\. This, too, is the most expressive (most in effect) of those statements which _were_ ever spoken forth (till now), _or which one_ speaks forth (at present) [^16], _or shall_ speak forth [^17] (even henceforth); (25) for it is _through_ such a statement (such in effect) as that, _if_ the whole embodied existence (26) learnt it _and_, having learnt [^18], (that is, they shall accomplish _it_ easily,) they retain _it_, (that is, they <span id="p457"><sup><small>[ p. 457 ]</small></sup></span> should rely upon it,) abstinence from passing _away_ would be quite masterful, (that is, they become immortal). 27. This, too, is our saying spoken forth, (preserved [^19] among the revelation mentioned <i>n</i> this [^20] fargar<i>d</i>,) which is learnt, (that is, they shall accomplish it easily,) and _one_ recites, (that is, he utters it in a ceremonial,) thus _for_ any one whatever of the beings whose righteousness is best, (that is, should he do it for a ceremonial, he becomes _fit_ for it; it is when he utters this in a ceremonial _that_ his soul becomes immortal).

28\. As _it is_ here spoken forth, (that a ruler and high-priest are to be maintained; as these things are so spoken, _and_ as this law is so) (29) even when it gives him an Ahu and a Ratu, (that is, it gives up _his_ person to the priestly assembly,) so it is thereby taught to him _that_ the thought of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is the creature _with_ the first thinking, (that is, the Gâthic lore is set going by him ) (30) whatever teaches [^21] this (is the person of him who is king of kings, who) is the greatest (of men) of every description [^22], (that is, it possesses [^21] a person in the king of kings ) _and_ so it is taught _that_ the creatures [^23] are for him, (where the Gâthic lore is set going by him).

31\. Whatever is a good emanation for [^21] Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that is, has an origin in his personality,) is through _the word_ vangh<i>e</i>u<i>s</i>, (which in the division becomes the beginning of) the third assertion here, whose recital is ‘he gives through Vohûman,’ (that is, the recitation which he utters properly is accomplished by him,) and, besides, here is that which <span id="p458"><sup><small>[ p. 458 ]</small></sup></span> Vohûman has taught, (that is, the reward and recompense which they give Vohûman, they attribute also to him;) (32) whatever [^24] is a further indication by Vohûman, (that is, anything which he may accomplish [^24] properly as a token, and is performed by him,) became so through this summing up (that is, its end occurred) in <i>s</i><i>h</i>yaothananãm; (33) here among the existences was the summing up [^25], (that is, it was its end).

34\. What it teaches to the creatures [^26] of him who is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is thus: he _who is_ like him is he who is his own creature [^26], (that is, even these people it tells something so, _and_ thus [^24] they attain again, through purity, to the possession of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, just as Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> produced _them_ through purity). 35. _By_ ‘the dominion is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>’ it has taught, that he has made Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> his ruler [^27], over his own person, (who shall perform that which is revealed by the Avesta ) and this is taught, _that_ through him is the ministration of the poor, (that is, happiness is thereby caused by him,) (36) which is friendship _for_ the Spîtâmân; (and the religion of the Spîtâmân became) _these_ five assertions, (that is, the decrees in it were five,) (37) _which_ were the <span id="p459"><sup><small>[ p. 459 ]</small></sup></span> whole enunciation of the saying, _and_ the whole saying was that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^28].

38\. For the sake of development Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (for cherishing the creatures,) pronounced the Ahunavair, and in its development _there_ was a summing up, (that is, its end occurred). 39. Quickly, when [^29] destruction arose, (that is [^30], the destroyer,) _and_ rushed in, even among the wicked he uttered (as resistance) (40) this interdict:—(41) ‘Neither our thoughts, nor [^30] teachings, (_as_ I have not taught that which thou hast taught,) nor wisdoms, (for I consider wisdom as virtuousness, and thou considerest _it_ as viciousness,) (42) nor wills, (for my will is a virtuous wish, and thine a vicious _one_,) nor words, (for I speak that which is virtuous, and thou speakest that which is vicious) nor actions, (for my actions are virtuous, and thine are vicious,) (43) nor religions, (for my religion is the Gâthic lore, and thine is witchcraft,) nor souls are themselves in unison, (for _as to_ those who rely upon my things, and those who rely upon thy things, their souls are not in one place;’ he who said this, that even their souls exist, must thus say that _they are_ not souls in unison _with_ ours).

44\. Also this saying, which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> uttered, _has_ the three degrees, the four classes, (priest, warrior, husbandman, and artisan) the five chieftainships, (house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, province-ruler, <span id="p460"><sup><small>[ p. 460 ]</small></sup></span> and supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t,) and its summing up is with liberality, (thus it is possible to make _it_ completely for their own, when they deliver themselves up to the priests). 45. Which are the degrees of it? Good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; (they are [^31], indeed, virtuous among the degrees of religion). 46. Which are the classes? The priest, warrior, husbandman, and artisan, (47) who are the whole day _and_ night with a righteous man, who are thinking rightly, speaking rightly, and acting rightly, (48) who _have_ recognised a priestly authority, (that is, possess a high-priest,) who _have_ taught the religion, (that is, have provided a ceremony,) (49) _and_ who, through their actions, are a furtherance of the world of righteousness, (owing to the work they accomplish). 50. Which are the chiefs? The house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, province-ruler, and the Zaratû<i>s</i>t is the fifth (51) _in_ those provinces which are other than the Ragha [^32] of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; _with_ four chieftainships is the Ragha of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 52. Which are the chiefs of that? The house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, and the Zaratû<i>s</i>t is the fourth; (that is, when he was in his own province, he also produced its period _of prosperity_, who arises fourth).

53\. How _was it_ when through good thought, (that is, the religion remained in the degree of good thought)? When it arose first in a righteous thinker, (it arose in Gâyômar<i>d</i>, and he thought for it). 54. How, when through good words? When _it was_ the bounteous text, (doing good). 55. How, <span id="p461"><sup><small>[ p. 461 ]</small></sup></span> when through good deeds? When _it was_ the praise even of righteousness _by_ the first creature, (that is, they shall perform the ceremonial, and also other good works, through the Gâtha lore).

56\. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> proclaimed; for what _was it_ proclaimed by him? For the righteous spiritual and worldly _existence_, (_for_ the benefit of the spiritual and worldly _existence_). 57. Owing to what desire (owing to what necessity) _was_ the said announcement proclaimed [^33] by him? (So that he shall become) the privileged developer, (he who is a resolute ruler). 58. For how many righteous (is it requisite to utter it)? (So that _one may_ become) a developer, (even he who may be) an irresolute ruler [^34], (to whom they reveal these words. So that the glory of the Kayâns, such as _it is_ with good rulers, should be even so with evil rulers; with good rulers for this purpose, that so they shall produce more benefit; and with evil rulers for this purpose, that so they shall produce less harm) [^35].

### Pahl. Yas. XX = Bakŏ II.

The beginning of the second subdivision [^36].

1\. It was a proclamation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the Ashem vohû vahi<i>s</i>tem astî [^37]; besides perfect excellence is taught by it to him, (that is, benefit is <span id="p462"><sup><small>[ p. 462 ]</small></sup></span> produced by it for him,) who shall make self-progress his own, (that is, shall produce that which is necessary to produce,) through vohû vahi<i>s</i>tem astî [^38], thus become the summing up of the assertion, (that is, it became its end). 2. U<i>s</i>tâ astî, u<i>s</i>tâ ahmâi [^39] has, besides, taught the righteous of every kind the happy progress which is necessary to arise for the righteous of every kind, (so that [^40] happiness _may_ be caused thereby); whatever endurance of man (_or_ diligence) it is necessary for the righteous of every kind to occasion is, besides, taught to the righteous of [^41] every kind, (so that one's happiness _may_ be caused thereby). 3. Hya<i>d</i> ashâi vahi<i>s</i>tâi ashem [^39] has, besides, taught _that_ all (the duty and good works which are revealed in the text are the whole text (for him whose Avesta and Zand are easy, so that, through _its_ Avesta and Zand, he can make manifest all the duty and good works of that whole text) (4) which teaches [^42] _that_ the dominion is for righteousness [^43], (so that, _one_ may exercise authority through virtuousness, that is, it should be the opinion that it teaches a dominion through virtuousness, so that _one may_ possess authority through virtuousness ) (5) which also teaches the truth to that righteous invoker, (so that he may make a true decision;) (6) _and_ which also teaches the truth to you that are <span id="p463"><sup><small>[ p. 463 ]</small></sup></span> fraught with advantage, (so that it may produce true judgment). _These_ were the three assertions, (that is, three decrees were in it,) (7) _and_ the whole saying was a proclamation, the whole saying was that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

8\. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> proclaimed; (_&c., as in Pahl. Yas. XIX_, 56-58).

### Pahl. Yas. XXI = Bakŏ III.

#### The beginning of the third subdivision [^44].

1\. A saying of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t, to be reverenced, was: ‘Whoever of those existing is thus in worship as regards _the good_ [^45]’: Here what is taught by it is the worship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that _it is_ that which _one_ should provide for,) which is the law of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that is, his virtuous law,) whereby the reverence _of_ existence is taught, (that is, that which he would most occasion, which is the ever-asking for progeny _by_ mankind; and he mentions that thing to them,) _through_ which _it_ is possible for them to live well. 2. Here, besides, the reverence of those males _and_ females of the righteous, through complete devotion [^46] who _was_ the first, is taught by it, (3) which is the obeisance _for_ the archangels, (that is, it would occasion the propitiation of the archangels). _These_ were the three assertions, (that is, three decrees were in it,) _and_ it was _in_ every way a saying to be reverenced. _Unto_ whom was the reverence? Unto the archangels in that worship.

4\. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Happy is he <span id="p464"><sup><small>[ p. 464 ]</small></sup></span> whose happiness is the happiness of any one whatever, (5) and _may_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> grant it, through predominance of will, (through his requirement) [^47].’ 6. What reply did he speak through that utterance of words, (what _was_ the thing he spoke about [^48])? 7. He spoke the reply of happy progress, the happy progress of the righteous of every kind, who are, who have been, and who _will_ arise. 8. The developer told (that man, as) the development, _in_ reply; _and_ (the reward as) the development that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> mentioned _in_ reply _was_: ‘That development [^49] (I call) righteous, (which) is a development for the righteous.’

Dk. IX, Chap. XLVII, 11, refers to Pahl. Yas. XIX, 12-15, which is thus quoted in Sls. X, 26, in a shorter and altered form:—‘As it says in the Bak thus: "Whoever shall mutter, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! my apportionment of the Ahunavair, (that is, shall softly take _it inwardly_) _and_ shall let _it_ escape [^50] again, (that is, shall utter _it aloud_) so much as a half, or a third, or a fourth, or a fifth, his soul will I shield [^51], I who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, from the best existence, (that is, I _will_ keep it away,) by such an extent as the width of this earth."’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (453:1) As the detailed account of the first three fargar<i>d</i>s of this Nask, in Dk. IX, contains about 840 Pahlavi words, and represents about 730 words of the original Avesta text in Yas. XIX—XXI, with 1630 in its Pahlavi version, it may be assumed that the detailed account of the whole Nask, extending to nearly 11,000 words, indicates about 9,500 words of Avesta text and 21,200 of Pahlavi version as the total extent of this Nask.

[^2]: (453:2) The heading of this first hâ is given in 32, Pt4, Mf4 which have been consulted by the translator in addition to Spiegel's text representing K5. The division into sections is that adopted by Spiegel, and the passages in parentheses have no equivalents in the Avesta text.

[^3]: (453:3) Sp., J2 insert ‘good _and_.’

[^4]: (453:4) J2 adds ‘(this is, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the creator is righteous; the rest is through the praise which says the creator is righteous);’ compare Pahl. Vend. II, 1.

[^5]: (454:1) Assuming that the khr<i>a</i>fstar<i>d</i>ŏ, or khr<i>a</i>fôstar<i>d</i>ŏ, of Pt4, Mf4, stands for khrafstarânŏ, as required by the Avesta text. Sp., J2 have ‘who were confounded by wisdom.’

[^6]: (454:2) So in Pt4, Mf4; but Sp., J2 may mean ‘he strictly does not speak out in the middle of its Avesta.’

[^7]: (454:3) All the MSS. have ‘while talking, _or_ without anxiety,’ as in § 8; but this does not correspond with the Avesta text. The repetition of the parenthetical clause, about the ceremonial, which also occurs in § 8, is likewise suspicious.

[^8]: (455:1) Pt4, Mf4 vâvar; Sp., J2 have va-aêvar, ‘and certainly.’

[^9]: (455:2) So in Pt4, Mf4; Sp., J2 have ‘I would,’ which may be right.

[^10]: (455:3) Pt4, Mf4 aparôdînê<i>d</i>; Sp., J2 have ba<i>r</i>â âpahlûkinê<i>d</i>, ‘puts quite aside.’

[^11]: (455:4) Pahl. ba<i>r</i>â yangê<i>d</i> (Pers. yan<i>g</i>ad).

[^12]: (455:5) Only in J2.

[^13]: (455:6) See Dk. VIII, Chap. XX, 65.

[^14]: (455:7) Pahl. tanôm (Pers. tanam).

[^15]: (456:1) J2 omits gûftŏ, ‘_what was_ said.’

[^16]: (456:2) Pahl. avŏ kevan in Pt4.

[^17]: (456:3) ‘_Or_ is spoken forth’ in Pt4, Mf4.

[^18]: (456:4) ‘Have learnt that which they should have learnt’ in Pt4, Mf4.

[^19]: (457:1) J2 has ‘given.’

[^20]: (457:2) Pt4, Mf4 insert ‘very.’

[^21]: (457:3) So in J2, Pt4, Mf4.

[^22]: (457:4) Pt4, Mf4, ‘the greatest of all men.’

[^23]: (457:5) See [p. 458](.), n. [^3].

[^24]: (458:1) So in J2, Pt4, Mf4.

[^25]: (458:2) Sp., J2 add ‘of the sacred beings.’

[^26]: (458:3) Only here, and in § 30, dâhm, ‘a member of the community,’ is substituted for the usual dâm, ‘a creature.’ Either meaning might suit the context, but the Avesta text clearly has ‘creature,’ and would require more alteration, to suit it to the Pahlavi version, than _vice versa_. Dk. IX, Chap. XLVII, affords no assistance, as it does not allude to this passage.

[^27]: (458:4) The Pahlavi version of the Av. ta<i>d</i> mazdâ tavâ khshathrem quoted in Dk. IX, Chap. XLVII, 17.

[^28]: (459:1) As the Pahlavi text of the foregoing interpretation is a commentary upon an Avesta commentary on an obscure Avesta text, it must be expected to be difficult to translate with certainty.

[^29]: (459:2) Pt4, Mf4 omit ‘when;’ but the speaker of the interdict is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 2 c-e.

[^30]: (459:3) So in J2, Pt4, Mf4.

[^31]: (460:1) J2, Pt4, Mf4 indicate hômant (= aît).

[^32]: (460:2) The ancient city of Raî which stood not far from Teheran.

[^33]: (461:1) Pt4, Mf4 have f<i>r</i><i>â</i><i>z</i> gûftŏ, as in Pahl. Yas. XX, 9.

[^34]: (461:2) Quoted in Dk. IX, Chap. LXIX, 45.

[^35]: (461:3) §§ 56-58 are repeated at the end of Pahl. Yas. XX, with reference to the Ashem.

[^36]: (461:4) So in Pt4, Mf4.

[^37]: (461:5) This Avesta is quoted as part of the Pahlavi version, and is translated, in Pt4, Mf4, by the usual Pahlavi for ‘righteousness is perfect excellence.’

[^38]: (462:1) So in Pt4, Mf4; J2 has ‘through one vohû vahi<i>s</i>tem; and vahi<i>s</i>tem astî.’

[^39]: (462:2) This phrase of the Ashem, which begins the Avesta of this section, must also be understood as beginning its Pahlavi version.

[^40]: (462:3) Only Sp. adds 'one's' here.

[^41]: (462:4) Only Sp. has ‘the righteous of,’ but it is in the Avesta text.

[^42]: (462:5) So in Pt4, Mf4.

[^43]: (462:6) Just as the Ahunavair states that ‘the dominion is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>’ (see Pahl. Yas. XIX, 35).

[^44]: (463:1) So in Pt4, Mf4.

[^45]: (463:2) The beginning of the YêNhê-hâtãm (see Dk. IX, Chap. IV, 1 n).

[^46]: (463:3) The archangel Ârmaiti, or Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>.

[^47]: (464:1) Quoted from Pahl. Yas. XLII, 1 a, b.

[^48]: (464:2) Pt4, Mf4 have madam in place of maman.

[^49]: (464:3) So in Pt4, Mf4.

[^50]: (464:4) Pahl. rahôînê<i>d</i>, or rânînê<i>d</i>, ‘reject.’ It is the alteration in this verb that changes the meaning of the original text; as the preceding and following verbs, vakhdûnê<i>d</i> and gôyê<i>d</i>, do not differ in Pahlavi writing from the vadîdûnê<i>d</i> and yangê<i>d</i> of Pahl. Yas. XIX, 12.

[^51]: (464:5) Pahl. netrûnam.
