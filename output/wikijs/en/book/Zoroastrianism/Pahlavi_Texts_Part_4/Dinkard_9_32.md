## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXXII.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The ninth fargar<i>d</i>, <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaiti [^1], is about the coming of three deceitful demons, and _their_ making supplication (lâ<i>g</i>ak-karîh) _to_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^2], so that he should consider and reward those aggrieved by him, and it would amount to strength for them in destroying the creatures. 2. The disgorging (akhvâr<i>d</i>anŏ) of supplication _by_ those demons clamorously upwards from an abyss, _and_ the statement of one that _he is_ [^3] the kindred that is undeceitful, of _another_ one that _he is_ the serfdom that is undeceitful, _and_ of _the third_ one that he is the confederacy that is undeceitful, _was_ in these _words_, namely: ‘We are those spirits when the kinsman, confederate, and serf [^2] do not break promises, one with the other; we are not really these that are no implements of thine, _but_ our religion _and_ law are thine, and we do thy will; we become assistants of _him_ who is thy friend, and injurers of _him_ who is thy enemy [^4]; _and_ from thee we beg a position in the existence that is best, the reward that is a reward _of_ the worthy.’

3\. The reply of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to them _was_ thus: ‘You rush out, astute in evil, to the extremity (bûn) of that horrible gloom [^5]; so you are all from the demon, your race is really from Evil Thought, that <span id="p253"><sup><small>[ p. 253 ]</small></sup></span> is, your race is from there where Evil Thought [^6], as well as Lust the destroyer and also Greed the well-accumulating, _resides_, and _where_, moreover, Îndar the fighter is the spirit of the religion of apostasy and further deceives the worldly _existence_ of mankind, as to proper living and immortal progress [^7], and first confines their thoughts. 4. He shall first do this, so that he _may_ restrain the thoughts of men from virtuous things [^8], and their further words and perverted further deeds from the ceremonial of us who are archangels; they further lose _their_ wisdom [^9], and further consider even as perfect righteousness that which is loved _by_ the demons; they utter the false words and consecrate with the worse deeds of mankind; _and_ with the holy-water which _one_ consecrates most _to_ you, more falsely _and_ more arrogantly [^10] than that falsity and arrogance, do they enhance the greatest ceremonial, so that they shall make more of the most. 5. Owing to discord, through that love of you who are demons, they smite with destruction _him_ who shall not be a satisfaction to you in the presidency; _and_ the leader they take (girênd) becomes a destroyer, so in the sequel, too, there is _some one_ that smites _him_; even though they <span id="p254"><sup><small>[ p. 254 ]</small></sup></span> consider _him_ as your follower, they shall occasion _his_ destruction. 6. You are evil demons for a congregation when they speak of avoiding you, and worse for the ceremonial, _or_ obeisance, when it occurs; that which becomes all clearness _to_ the utterer of righteousness, in _this_ existence, you utterly destroy; _and_ the lodgment of complete mindfulness in the body is for admonition to human beings about abstaining from the demons.’

7\. This, too, _is stated_, namely: ‘Evil _are_ you _who_ are wicked _and_ worship the demons with good holy-water _and_ with words; through them the holy-water obtains evil recompense, even the hell that is horrible.’ 8. This, too, _he spoke_, namely: ‘Concerning those malicious demons [^11] I _will_ first mention intelligibly to thee when they have come to the world, that is, first when they have rushed in, how their jurisdiction arose. 9. _For_ thirty centuries [^12] those of my world were immortal _and_ undecaying, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _but_ when the thirtieth century was accomplished [^13], <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! the sweat (khvâe) produced by the demons then came on to my Gâyômar<i>d</i> [^14], for his affliction, so long a time as a man speaks forth these words _of_ the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^15], relating to the spiritual lord and priestly master. 10. And when he issued from that sweat he was shadowless, that is, darkness had entered [^16]; and the words of the formula (âyîn) relating to the spiritual lord and priestly master _were_ spoken forth by me, and when <span id="p255"><sup><small>[ p. 255 ]</small></sup></span> vâstârem [^17] was uttered by me the demons then fell [^18] into the gloom.’

11\. About the harm owing to the demons this, too, _he spoke_, namely: ‘The destructiveness _of_ the evil spirit is _his_ evil teaching _by_ statements [^19] _to_ my creatures; and my riches (î<i>s</i>tŏ) plundered by him are the proportion of the production _and_ possession of wealth _for_ which a desire exists through Good Thought; that is, when they possess _it_ with propriety _it is_ desirable [^20]. 12. And mankind _were_ gratified by that son of Vîvangh<i>a</i>u who was Yim [^21], and cattle _were_ gratified by him, producing thus _the phrase_ “you are mankind” in words, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! when he spoke to mankind thus: "You are the mankind for cattle, that is, you _who_ are mankind eat meat of your own subdivision, and through subdivision by you there is a superabundant occurrence of meat [^22]; you are mankind, neither for Greed (<i>â</i><i>z</i>ŏ), nor for Envy (arêshkŏ) [^23], do thou throw away the warm entrails (taftôg rû<i>d</i>îk), nor do thou throw _them_ away warm on account of custom (pî<i>s</i>akŏ), now you slay for slaughtering, so that thus _it may be_ beneficial for you and your servant."’

13\. This, too, _is stated_, namely: ‘Even that man <span id="p256"><sup><small>[ p. 256 ]</small></sup></span> is produced for the destruction of mine [^24], who is possessed _by_ the wicked evil spirit; the want of discernment of that man is a tedious life, in which the utterance of the praise of righteousness is the want of ceremonial of which a righteous man spoke _thus:_ “At _the place_ where their pasture is you are the mankind, the all-producer that fully developes _them, and_ the all-collector that would thoroughly set _them_ moving; in their pasture you are the mankind, _and_ they all remain [^25]; with hospitality _for_ the body they remain on account of their pasture, _and_ in fighting they strike _their_ heads together; you are the mankind of their pasture, it is expedient and you deprive _it_ of moisture [^26] through fire; as to other things, it was also you that made one altogether believe that untrue statement which is a lie—the possession of material _existence by_ life—owing to external seduction by the fiend who has come chiefly to you.”’

14\. About the harm owing to the demons this, too, _is stated_, namely: ‘Their accomplishment of arrogance over these creatures of mine, _and_ also the unfitness for heaven (avahi<i>s</i>tîh-i<i>k</i>) of a righteous man, _and_ that, too, of a valiant _one_, are _due to_ the burial of a corpse.’ 15. This, too, namely: ‘They who drag away a corpse [^27] are most hurtful for men, as regards the wealth of the religion in this world, _and_ as regards sheep and beasts _of burden_.’ 16. This, too, namely: ‘_As to_ the people, assisted _by_ <span id="p257"><sup><small>[ p. 257 ]</small></sup></span> _one_ living _in_ terrible difficulty, who deliver the corpse of a dead _person_, on a sheep _or_ beast _of burden_, at a village where they shall convey _it_, they distress the fire and also the water flowing _from_ the hills [^28], likewise those liquids of the body which are ten [^29], and those saps (aêvanŏ) _of plants_ which are fourfold in thousands, that is, they come out a thousand at one time.’

17\. ‘They are giving more assistance when [^30] _it is_ the corpse _of_ a wicked _person;_ concerning them, too, I tell thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! that they _shall_ arrive in the ninth and tenth centuries [^31] who are the spawn of the fiend (drû<i>g</i>ô hûnôyâkŏ) and the cesspool (rîkhdâr) of the evil spirit; even one of them is more to be destroyed than ten idolators (dêvîyastô) _by_ him they shall make pure, that is, _the people_ shall make him quite void of wealth who is a priest without recitation _and_ commendation. 18. And they, who _will be_ full <span id="p258"><sup><small>[ p. 258 ]</small></sup></span> many in the future, shall bring prostration upon him who is an innocent person, the husbandman who watches the frog of the ditch (zak-î gîlûgŏ vazagh) so that he may keep it away from mankind; and they execute ill-contrived commands. 19. They also produce destruction for these of mine, and speak of the living state, to these of my religion, thus: “When living is an expediency it is in our way;” they are wicked, they dwindle through greatness and even terror, that is, they shall commit sin through leadership and vassalage [^32] who are smiting thee, and they speak folly who are smiting this pure religion of thine, O Spîtâmân!’

20\. ‘They, too, who recite this thy revelation of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, say that the distinction (nî<i>s</i>ôn) of those others from those who are thine, even those whom they hurt, is this, that they plunder, they also think scornfully of this thy ceremonial, and think scornfully of the obeisances (nîyâyisnŏ) and of both those blessings from me, the Avesta and Zand which I, who am the most propitious of spirits, spoke forth to thee. 21. They also injure the ceremonial of him who is perfectly righteous [^33], even the obeisance arisen from a disciple of Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân; and they chant that which is a settled effusion (ba<i>r</i>â-hankhetûntô rêgîh) that is very evil, as a perfect deed for mankind [^34], which those of very evil deeds call joy [^35].’ <span id="p259"><sup><small>[ p. 259 ]</small></sup></span> 22\. ‘They seek sovereignty as a devouring (grehmakŏ), that is, they seek privilege for a bribe, and in their abode is he who is very evil in thought, that is, they seek with this design, that, _for_ the hundred which another gives up, they _may_ take two hundred away _from_ the other [^36]; they destroy the best existence [^37], they destroy their own souls, _and_ they destroy the world of material beings. 23. Then they who are privileged shall convey that sovereignty _of_ the Kîk and Karap [^38], even those that are the worst-ruling who are in the country, unto him who is best-ruling in house, village, community, _and_ province; _and_ then both shall keep up an uproar, he who is well-ruling and also he who is ill-ruling, and he who is ill-ruling is beaten, and he is delivered up to the best-ruling ruler. 24. _And_ then, among them, _he_ who seeks for a devouring (grehmakŏ) of all that which is animate, as well as that which is inanimate, is _he_ who is desirous of assault and complaint; _and he_ who fears him who is a righteous man of mine allots _him_ comfort, and is _he_ who watches those who are an exposition of righteousness [^39], and who would be wizards _or_ witches, so that _the authorities_ shall inflict punishment _upon_ them.’

25\. And this, too, _is stated_, namely: ‘The malice of many malicious _ones_ demands that they shall inflict punishment _on_ sinners [^40] when they put (pa<i>d</i>\-mû<i>g</i>ênd) life into the body, that is, they give life <span id="p260"><sup><small>[ p. 260 ]</small></sup></span> back to the body; but _for_ that purpose the metal, melted forth, arises full upon the earth, which does not wreak vengeance _on_ him who is righteous, and does wreak vengeance _on_ him who is wicked, _when_ I, who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, produce the renovation among the existences [^41]. 26. Thus, too, that _which_ becomes a healthful world—a healthful one that is thus mine—never first becomes that further sick _one_ which, apart from me, is even now the immortal _and_ manifest place _where_ vengeance exists [^42]; and they become also aware, through that sovereignty of mine, that, apart from me, even now immortal is the material world of righteousness.’

27\. Excellence _that is_ perfect is righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (252:1) See Chap. IX, 1 n.

[^2]: (252:2) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 1 a.

[^3]: (252:3) Literally ‘I am.’

[^4]: (252:4) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 1 c.

[^5]: (252:5) Compare Pahl. Vend. XIX, 147.

[^6]: (253:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 3 a. For the demons here mentioned, Akômanô, Varenô, and _Â_<i>z</i>ŏ, see Bk. VIII, Chaps. IX, 3, XXXI, 44; Îndar is the same as Andar (in Chap. IX, 1), the arch-demon who perverts from virtue and despises the sacred shirt and girdle (Bd. I, 27, XXVIII, 8). With reference to the good old schism-hypothesis, that identified the Av. daêva I<i>n</i>dra, or Andra, with the Sans. deva Indra, it is worthy of note that he is here represented as the pervading spirit of an apostate religion, and is termed the kûshî<i>d</i>âr, ‘fighter, slayer.’

[^7]: (253:2) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 5 a.

[^8]: (253:3) See Bd. XXVIII, 8.

[^9]: (253:4) See Pahl. Yas. XXX, 4 c.

[^10]: (253:5) Ibid. 3 b.

[^11]: (254:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 7 a, 8 a.

[^12]: (254:2) See Bd. I, 20, 21. But from § 10 it appears more probable that these are the three millenniums mentioned in Bd. I, 8.

[^13]: (254:3) Bd. III, 3.

[^14]: (254:4) Ibid. 19.

[^15]: (254:5) See Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7 n.

[^16]: (254:6) Bd. III, 20.

[^17]: (255:1) The last word of the formula. In Bd. I, 21, 22 this utterance seems to be placed before the attack upon Gâyômar<i>d</i>, but until the complete text of the Irânian Bundahi<i>s</i> has been examined, some doubt as to the exact sequence of its statements may be entertained.

[^18]: (255:2) Pahl. zîflûnî<i>d</i>, for yîflûnî<i>d</i>, formed from the aorist of Ch. נְפַל; instead of the usual neflûnast, formed from the preterit.

[^19]: (255:3) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 9 a.

[^20]: (255:4) Ibid. 9b. Instead of <i>a</i><i>v</i>ôrdŏ, ‘plundered,’ B has the miswriting s<i>p</i>ôrdŏ, ‘consigned.’

[^21]: (255:5) Ibid. 8 a and Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 6.

[^22]: (255:6) Ibid. 8 b.

[^23]: (255:7) Alluding, perhaps, to the legend detailed in Bd. XV, 18, 19.

[^24]: (256:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 10 a.

[^25]: (256:2) Or, perhaps, ‘and they remain astonished,’ (va-s<i>î</i>pŏ mânênd).

[^26]: (256:3) Pahl. vîy<i>â</i><i>v</i>ânînê<i>d</i> which, with vâstar, ‘pasture,’ occurs in Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 10 c.

[^27]: (256:4) They who carry a corpse alone, like the iristô-kasha of Vend. III, 15.

[^28]: (257:1) Pahl. gêrân-ta<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ = Av. h<i>e</i>bvai<i>n</i>ti in Yas. XXXVIII, 3 and Av. thraotô-stâ<i>d</i> in Yas. LXVIII, 6, &c. It is the second species of liquid in Bd. XXI, 1.

[^29]: (257:2) Only nine are mentioned in Bd. XXI, 1, namely: semen, urine, sweat, skin-fluid, tears, blood, oil, saliva, and milk.

[^30]: (257:3) Assuming that mûn stands for amat as in Bk. VIII, Chap. XXI, 10.

[^31]: (257:4) If these centuries are dated from ‘the coming of the religion,’ according to the incorrect Arabian chronology of the Bundahi<i>s</i>, they extended from A.D. 393 or 435 to 593 or 635 (see Byt. III, 11 n). In the ninth century lived king Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>aka<i>r</i><i>d</i> (A.D. 399-420), surnamed ‘the sinner’ by the priesthood because he tolerated other religions, and the heretic Mazdak who was put to death in A.D. 528. In the tenth century the Muhammadan religion arose, and the Sasanian dynasty tottered to its fall. If it were not for the manifest errors in the Bundahi<i>s</i> chronology, this passage in our text might be important for fixing the age of the Pahlavi version of this Nask.

[^32]: (258:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 11 a.

[^33]: (258:2) Ibid. 11 c.

[^34]: (258:3) Ibid. 12 a, which has corrupted rêgîh into rêsh; the former, corresponding better with the original Av. r<i>a</i>unghayen, can be compared with Pers. rîhîdan, rêzîdan; or it might mean ‘imposture,’ compare Pers. rîgan.

[^35]: (258:4) Ibid. 12 b.

[^36]: (259:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 13 a; the exact meaning of grehmakŏ (Av. ger<i>e</i>hma) is uncertain, and the last verb is literally ‘I _may_ take.’

[^37]: (259:2) Ibid. 13 b.

[^38]: (259:3) Ibid. 14 a, 15 a, and Bk. VIII, Chap. XXXV, 13 n.

[^39]: (259:4) Ibid. 13 c.

[^40]: (259:5) Ibid. 16 c.

[^41]: (260:1) At the resurrection all men are said to be purified in melted metal which hurts only those who have been wicked (see Bd. XXX, 19, 20).

[^42]: (260:2) That is, the earth never becomes hell.
