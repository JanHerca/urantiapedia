## EXTANT FRAGMENTS. VI. PÂ<i>G</i>AG NASK [^1].

Dk. VIII, Chap. VII, 4, or 5, probably refers to the passage which contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. IX, 9, 10:—‘In a passage of the fifth fargar<i>d</i> of the Pâ<i>g</i>ôn it is declared that _one_ mentions these characteristics of four kinds of worship of the sacred beings:—one is that whose Avesta is correct, _but_ the man is bad; the second is that whose Avesta is faulty, _but_ the man is good; the third is that whose Avesta is correct, _and_ the man is good; _and_ the fourth is that whose Avesta is faulty, _and_ the man is bad. _That_ whose Avesta is correct, _but_ the man bad, the archangels will approach and will listen to, <span id="p467"><sup><small>[ p. 467 ]</small></sup></span> _but_ do not accept; _that_ whose Avesta is faulty, _but_ the man good, the archangels _and_ sacred being will approach, _but_ do not listen to, _and_ will accept; _that_ whose Avesta is correct, _and_ the man good, the archangels _and_ sacred being will approach, will come to, will listen to, and will accept; _and that_ whose Avesta is faulty, _and_ the man bad, they do not approach, do not listen to, and do not accept.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (466:2) The account of this Nask in Dk. VIII (like those of Nasks VIII, XII, XIII, XX), though four or five times as long as the very short accounts, is still short, and the data for estimating the original extent of these five Nasks are very inadequate. We may, perhaps, guess that the two Nasks VI, VIII were together equal to half the length of the four other Hadha-mãthric Nasks IV, VII, IX, X, and then proceed to apportion the extent, thus guessed, between the two in proportion to the number of Pahlavi words in the short account of each. In this way we shall find that the 505 Pahlavi words in the short account of the Pâ<i>g</i>ag may indicate about 9,100 words of Avesta text and 29,800 of Pahlavi version.
