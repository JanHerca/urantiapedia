## IV. FROM THE RIVÂYAT OF DASTÛR BARZÛ QIYÂMU-D-DÎN [^1].

1\. The reply about the Nasks of the Avesta. The Yathâ-ahû-vairyô is _of_ twenty-one words, and the Avesta is similarly _of_ twenty-one Nasks.

2\. The name of the first Nask is Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t, and that book is of thirty-three compilations, that is, it is of thirty-three subdivisions, and the description of the Lord and the angels is in it.

3\. The name of the second Nask is Stûdgar, and that is of twenty-two subdivisions; its description is about prayer, virtuous authority, and intercession.

4, The third Nask is the Vahi<i>s</i>t-mânthrah, and that is of twenty-two subdivisions about faith and heedfulness; and _one_ is reminded \[_&c., very nearly the same as in II_, 3\],

5\. The fourth Nask is the Bagh, and that is of twenty-one subdivisions; its explanation is about the religion and _its_ intention, and whatever the Lord _has_ made incumbent on mankind as to devotion and heedfulness; also about closing the path of Satan to oneself, and approaching the last abode.

6\. The name of the fifth book is Dvâzdah-hâmâst, and that is of thirty-two subdivisions in remembrance of the beginning \[_&c., very nearly the same as in II_, 5\].

7\. The name of the sixth Nask is Nâdar, _and_ that is of thirty-five compilations about the stars <span id="p434"><sup><small>[ p. 434 ]</small></sup></span> and the disposition and life of the sky. \[_&c., very nearly the same as in II_, 6 _to_\] Bavaf<i>t</i>âl, and in Persian the name of that book is Favâmsa'hân, that is, instruction arises therefrom for the moderns.

8\. The name of the seventh Nask is Pâ<i>g</i>am, _and_ that is of twenty-two subdivisions; its description is about quadrupeds _and_ how _they are_ made lawful, which is lawful \[_&c., as in II_, 7, _to_\] for the sake of a season-festival, and how it is necessary to perform whatever is in a season-festival; the expense of a season-festival \[_&c., as in II_, 7, _to_\] high-priests, and a description of the clothing _for_ a righteous gift, so that they _may_ obtain recompense in the end from heaven.

9\. The eighth Nask is the Ratu<i>s</i>tâyî, _and_ that is of fifty subdivisions; its purport is about the affairs of the king and obedience, cities constructed and made magnificent, birds, animals, and fish, and whatever is Ormazd's, besides the creatures of Aharman; \[_&c., as in II_, 8\].

10\. The name of the ninth book is Bari<i>s</i>, _and_ that is of sixty subdivisions, and about descriptions of kings and judges, and an investigation of their authority; also the relations of a peasant \[_&c., as in II_, 9, _to_\] deceit, and telling lies.

11\. The name of the tenth book is Ka<i>s</i>kanîz, _and_ that is of sixty subdivisions, about the advantage (faʓl) of natural wisdom and knowledge _as distinguished_ from acquired knowledge, that is, the knowledge born from the mother, and the knowledge which they learn _by_ instruction; doctrine about purity and truth, and anything \[_&c., as in II_, 10, _to_\] how it occurs.

12\. The name of the eleventh Nask is Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, <span id="p435"><sup><small>[ p. 435 ]</small></sup></span> and that is of sixty compilations, _but_ after the calamity of Alexander, when they sought _them_ again, they found no more _than_ eight subdivisions, and those are about Gu<i>s</i>tâsp's acceptance \[_&c., as in II_, 11\].

13\. The name of the twelfth book is ‘<i>H</i>as t, _and_ that is of twenty-two fargar<i>d</i>s in six portions. The first portion is about knowing the Lord, may he be honoured and glorified! and faith in the mission of Zaratu<i>s</i>t and any duties which are ordered in a book of the religion. The second portion is about the obedience of kings, the truth of the religion, and complying _with_ commands. The third portion is about the promise _to_ benefactors and their recompense, the punishment of evildoers, and escaping from hell. The fourth portion is about the mansions of the world, agriculture and trimming trees, the power of mankind and quadrupeds arisen therefrom, the obedience they exercise, and whatever duty they perform for the high-priests of the religion. The fifth portion \[_&c., as in II_, 12, _to_\] the obeisances, so that they obtain great rewards in the end.

14\. The name of the thirteenth book is Sfend, _and_ that is of sixty subdivisions, for the information of people who are in want of it, and for their knowledge; also for any persons who become covetous as to virtuous actions, _and_ proceed after the footsteps of the learned and people of religion, and receive advantage therefrom; and as reminders of the celestial sphere that there is advantage from the daily practice of them. Also about the accounts of the evil of mankind, by the apostle Zaratu<i>s</i>t, about the false speaking \[_&c., as in II_, 13\].

15\. The fourteenth Nask is the <i>G</i>ira<i>s</i>t, _and_ that <span id="p436"><sup><small>[ p. 436 ]</small></sup></span> is of twenty-two subdivisions, for the understanding of the causes of mankind \[_&c., as in II_, 14.\].

16\. The name of the fifteenth book is Baghân-ya<i>s</i>t, and that is of seventeen subdivisions, in praise of the Lord, the praiseworthy _and_ exalted, and the admitted angels; also thanksgiving _for_ the favours due to that which he makes expedient in the religion, and the thanksgiving _for_ his favour _lasts_ until _one_ obtains _it_ back in the end; likewise the appearance of the angels, and these are nobles for the praise of the sacred being.

17\. The name of the sixteenth book is Niyâram, and that is of fifty-four subdivisions, about decrees _as to_ riches, bringing abroad, and whatever is made lawful; obtaining deliverance from hell, performing service, slavery, and the nature of wayfarers; whatever is in the thoughts of mankind, and whatever is in the bodies of mankind.

18\. The name of the seventeenth book is Aspâram, and that is of sixty subdivisions about rituals \[_&c., very nearly the same as in II_, 17\].

19\. The name of the eighteenth Nask is Duvâsrôb, and that is of sixty-five subdivisions, about robbers (duvâyân?) of human beings \[_&c., very nearly the same as in II_, 18\].

20\. The name of the nineteenth Nask is Askâram, and that is of fifty-two fargar<i>d</i>s \[_&c., very nearly the same as in II_, 19\].

21\. The name of the twentieth Nask is Vîndâd, _and_ that is of twenty-two subdivisions \[_&c., very nearly the same as in II_, 20\]. And _as to_ this book Vîndâd, which is the twentieth book of the Nasks, out of the twenty-one Nasks of the Avesta, we and you are now using _it_ in the ceremonial, and when, <span id="p437"><sup><small>[ p. 437 ]</small></sup></span> after the calamity of Alexander, they sought for the books again, they found a portion of each Nask, _but_ did not find any Nask in completeness except the Vîndâd which they found complete.

22\. The name of the twenty-first Nask is Hâdokht, _and_ that is of thirty subdivisions, about the manner of bringing together and the many miracles, and _their_ excellences _and_ connections; and in this book the accursed devil becomes cursed and becomes annihilated.

23\. At present, since the Nasks _have_ not remained perfect in the midst _of us_, it is not possible to solemnize _them_, because Alexander the Rûman [^2] carried off a rough draft, in Rûman characters, of those of the twenty-one Nasks of the Avesta which were _about_ the stars and medicine, and repeatedly burnt the books of the Avesta, so that the soul of Alexander burns in hell; and after his calamity, every one of the high-priests, in council together, preserved something of the Avesta in _his_ mind, _and_ the aggregate _has_ disclosed the books of the Yasna (ya<i>s</i>t), Vîsperad, Vendîdâd, Fravash, Khûrdah Avesta, Darûn, Âfrîngân, <i>K</i>îdah Va<i>g</i>arkardan, and Bundahi<i>s</i>, _which_ they wrote correctly; _as to_ the remainder (tatammah) which they did not write, it was on this account, that they did not preserve _it_ correctly in _their_ minds. And the expectation, descended from the midst _of them_ in the court of Ormazd and the archangels, is thus, that Var<i>g</i>âvand, Peshôtan, and Hushêdar [^3] _will_ arrive in haste _for_ the manifestation of the religion, and the goodness <span id="p438"><sup><small>[ p. 438 ]</small></sup></span> of the religion again assumes splendour from a new head; the good and those of the good religion become cheerful and happy, and the bad and wicked become extinct and disappearing. Amen.
