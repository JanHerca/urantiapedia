## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XX.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The nineteenth fargar<i>d</i>, Ka<i>d</i>\-môi-urvâ [^1], is about where the souls, when they come together, extol the soul of him who _was_ a virtuous high-priest, a friend of the soul, because he did not injure it, _and_ guarded _it_ from hell.

2\. About the darkness, the intensity (bûr’<i>z</i>vŏ-hômandîh) and far-reaching bottomlessness of the blackness, and the absence of goodness _in_ hell; and the proximity to stenches, close concealment [^2], sleet-pelted clambering (pî<i>s</i>nakŏ-bâlînîh), frozen advancing, <span id="p210"><sup><small>[ p. 210 ]</small></sup></span> painful condition, distressed state, and awful fear of those in hell. 3. This, too, that is thrown open (lakhvâr ramîtun<i>d</i>) over it, from the Dâîtî peak [^3], which is in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, to Albûr’<i>z</i> [^4], and below the middle of which is the gate of hell, is the <i>K</i>înva<i>d</i> bridge [^5] which is the route (vi<i>d</i>âr) of every one, righteous _or_ wicked; the width across the route of the righteous is a breadth of nine spears, each one the length of three reeds, _but_ the route for the wicked becomes like the edge of a razor.

4\. ‘Thus say I [^6] unto thee, O Spîtâmân! that the man of truth steps forward over the <i>K</i>înva<i>d</i> pass, even the far-famed happy bridge; for Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i> [^7], the good promoter of the world, and Mit<i>r</i>ô [^8] of the vast cattle-pastures save only the man possessing truth from that distress, as though they _were_ a regiment (si<i>p</i>âh) a thousand strong. 5. So I say unto thee, O Spîtâmân! that thou shouldst not become a liar unto Mit<i>r</i>ô, neither when thou wouldst converse with the wicked, nor when _thou wouldst_ with those of thine own religion who are righteous; for both _of_ those are promises, both _with_ the wicked and the righteous; there is a promise, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! even _of_ a wolf with young animals, _but_ that which is a <span id="p211"><sup><small>[ p. 211 ]</small></sup></span> lascivious (<i>g</i>êhîk) promise is more awful, O Spîtâmân! 6. So I say unto thee, O Spîtâmân! that thou shouldst not seize a wanton (<i>g</i>êhîk) for use—that is, do not make her _thy_ wife—and with compulsion (ûpayami<i>s</i>nîh) of her [^9]—that is, do not let _thyself_ lie with her. 7. And if thou shouldst seize a courtezan for use, and with compulsion _of_ her, thou mayst not dismiss _her_ afterwards, neither in adversity, nor in prosperity, neither on account of fondness for self, nor _for_ life; because _he_ who seizes a courtezan for use, and with compulsion, and shall dismiss her on account of fondness for self, or _for_ life, becomes thereby a breaker of promises _to_ the house, village, community, _or_ province, _that_ gives her life (valman zîvînê<i>d</i>ŏ), _and to_ the soul _that_ animates her [^10].’

8\. So breaking the promise comes upon the children that are theirs, through evil teaching; _and_ he who is wicked is lying down without children at the bottom of hell. 9. _That_ is, there is nothing whatever _of_ [^11] happiness _for_ the wicked, that happiness which is produced abundantly by him _who is_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

10\. Perfect righteousness is excellence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (209:2) The first three words of the fourth, and last, hâ of the third Gâtha (Yas. L, 1), here written ka<i>d</i>\-môk-ravakŏ in Pahlavi.

[^2]: (209:3) Compare AV. LIV, 5-8:—‘As close as (tang-i<i>k</i>) from the ear to the eye, and as many as the hairs a horse has in his mane, so many in number the souls of the wicked stand, but they do not see, nor do they hear a sound, one from the other, and every one, therefore, thinks that he is alone.’ For a description of hell see also Dd. XXVII.

[^3]: (210:1) Or <i>K</i>akâ<i>d</i>\-î Dâîtî (see Pahl. Vend. XIX, 101; Bd. XII, 7).

[^4]: (210:2) Av. hara berezaiti, the range of lofty mountains supposed to surround the world (see Bd. V, 3-5).

[^5]: (210:3) Here called <i>K</i>înakŏ-pûhal, and <i>K</i>î<i>s</i>\-vi<i>d</i>arg in § 4; for a fuller description of it see Dd. XXI, 2-7. Allusion is made to it in Yas. L, 7.

[^6]: (210:4) Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, speaking to Zaratû<i>s</i>t. The whole of this paragraph appears to be quoted verbatim from the original Pahlavi text of the Nask.

[^7]: (210:5) See Chap. IX, 6.

[^8]: (210:6) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XLIV, 16.

[^9]: (211:1) Or, perhaps, ‘with approach to her’ (see Chap. XIX, 3 n). If ûpadami<i>s</i>nîh were read, it might mean ‘aspiration, or attachment’ for her.

[^10]: (211:2) This implies that the woman, being a notorious sinner, cannot reasonably complain of bodily injury on being dismissed; but her soul and the community are grievously injured by her being thus driven into further sin, and for this injury the man's soul will be made responsible.

[^11]: (211:3) K has ‘none even of this.’
