## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXXVIII.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The fifteenth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>\-fravakhshyâ [^1], is about the seven [^2] perfections of the admonitions of the religion. 2. First, association with the beneficent spirit of the creator, through hearing [^3], learning, _and_ practising his religion; _and_ this, too, that thereby arises the preservation _of_ the good creation when the destroyer is separated (van<i>g</i>î<i>d</i>). 3. Second, about separation from the destructive evil spirit [^4], _and_ the contempt which is due to his arrogance and falsehood, the chief of all his vice. 4. Third, governing the temper [^5] by good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; and this, that, whoever _of_ you does not so use this liturgy as thought and word [^6], they _will_ not allot him light, they _will_ not allot _him_ the best existence, _and_ he is miserable up to the last [^7]. 5. Fourth, about the perfection _of_ the nature of next-of-kin marriage [^8], which is when _it is_ a giving of one's own (khû<i>d</i>îh-dahi<i>s</i>nîh); and the decision <span id="p274"><sup><small>[ p. 274 ]</small></sup></span> given _about_ it, which is the goodness of one's own progeny for the manifestation of progeny; also the relationship, sturdiness, effectiveness, advantageousness, ownership, and giving in next-of-kin marriage. 6. _Its_ first accomplishment _was by_ the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in the fatherhood _of_ Vohûman [^1] who _was_ the first progeny, and from that arising of the practice (var’<i>z</i>\-yehevûnîh) _came_ the progress of the spiritual and worldly creatures and much connected _therewith_, such as the arising of splendour from light, radiance from splendour, _and_ lustrousness from radiance, _and_ the fully progressive diffusion and succession _of_ mankind till the renovation _of the universe;_ also, through spiritual and worldly passing on in the spiritual and worldly _existences_, Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>'s [^2] acceptance of the motherly glory _was_ an ennoblement. 7. Fifth, about providing _and_ maintaining the high-priests [^3] who are provided with a spiritual lord and possessing priestly instruction; the listening of his authorities of every kind to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the reward of the beneficent good works [^4] of the high-priesthood, _are_ authority for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; _and_ the reward of the good works of the high-priesthood is _their_ relation _to_ the best existence. 8. Sixth, about the praise, obeisance, _and_ ceremonial [^5] _for_ the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and this, too, that further conference _with_ Vohûman [^6] arises, and wisdom _and_ advantage [^7] are taught by <span id="p275"><sup><small>[ p. 275 ]</small></sup></span> him thus: ‘Thou shouldst be a supplicant for the immortal progress of the soul [^1], O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! so that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _may be_ lord of the creatures [^2], and the practice of propitiation _by_ mankind _may be_ that _for_ him, also a proportion of the ordering of obeisance [^3].’ 9. About the sovereignty of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^4]—even through the reward given _at_ the bridge _of judgment_—which is in his good assemblies [^5], those of the restorer of the world, the destroyer of the evil _one, and_ the benefiter.

10\. This, too, _is said_, namely: ‘Thou becomest, through complete mindfulness, O Spîtâmân! a perpetual adopter (giriftâr) of this ceremonial of mine [^6].’

11\. About Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _having_ given power [^7] to the creatures, the preparation [^8] of the power, and the contempt [^9] _for_ the evil spirit and his appliances; Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the creations gave that contempt back to the evil spirit and the primary (kâdmon) demons who are those produced by the demons.

12\. About the glorification of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _there is_ <span id="p276"><sup><small>[ p. 276 ]</small></sup></span> this, too, namely: ‘Thou art beneficial, thou art high-priest and master, and through thee exists the religion which is propitious [^1]; thou art brother and companion _of_ all the benefiters, and thus thy friend [^2] is Vohûman.’

13\. Perfect _is_ the excellence _of_ righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (273:1) See Chap. XV, 1 n; it is here written a<i>d</i>\-fravakhshê in Pahlavi.

[^2]: (273:2) Only six are numbered in our text, but the seventh seems to be detailed in § 9.

[^3]: (273:3) See Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 1 a.

[^4]: (273:4) Ibid. 1 d, e.

[^5]: (273:5) Ibid. 3 a.

[^6]: (273:6) Ibid. 3 c, d.

[^7]: (273:7) Ibid. 3 e.

[^8]: (273:8) Ibid. 4 a. There is nothing whatever about next-of-kin marriage in the original Avesta text of this Gâtha, but the Pahlavi translators (in order to interpolate authority for such marriages) took advantage of the Avesta speaking metaphorically of Mazda as being father of Good Thought (Vohûman), and of Bountiful Devotion (Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>) as being Mazda's daughter; while they ignored the old tradition that Vohûman was created _before_ Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> (see Bd. I, 23, 26). A translation of the Pahlavi version of this Gâtha passage is given in S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 392, 393.

[^1]: (274:1) See Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 4 c.

[^2]: (274:2) Ibid. 4 d.

[^3]: (274:3) Ibid. 5 a.

[^4]: (274:4) Rather doubtful, as the repairer of the MS. has omitted the first two Pahlavi letters of ki<i>r</i>fakŏ, ‘good works,’ when writing the word on a patch.

[^5]: (274:5) See Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 6 a, b, d.

[^6]: (274:6) Ibid. 6 d.

[^7]: (274:7) Ibid. 6 e, 7 a.

[^1]: (275:1) See Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 7 c.

[^2]: (275:2) Ibid. 7 e.

[^3]: (275:3) Ibid. 8 a.

[^4]: (275:4) Ibid. 9c. This appears to be the seventh ‘perfection’ mentioned in § 1.

[^5]: (275:5) Assuming that hû-hambâmîhâ stands for hû-hangâmîhâ, just as hanbâm is a common variant of hangâm. It might also mean ‘good times,’ but it seems to represent the incorrect word amâvandîh in Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 9 e, which each of the four MS. authorities spells differently. Mf4 has hû-dandîh which, no doubt, stands for an original hû-zandîh, ‘good community,’ a fair translation of Av. haozãthwa, and well expressed by ‘good assemblies.’

[^6]: (275:6) See Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 10 a.

[^7]: (275:7) Ibid. 10 e, in which zakŏ-î ought to be zôr-î according to Pt4, Mf4, with which J2 partly agrees.

[^8]: (275:8) Assuming that nîvârûnŏ stands for nîvâr<i>d</i>anŏ.

[^9]: (275:9) See Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 11 b.

[^1]: (276:1) See Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 11 d.

[^2]: (276:2) Ibid. 11 e.
