## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XVIII.

_Nîkâ<i>d</i>ûm Nask_.

1\. The third section is the Rêshistân (‘_wound code_’), particulars about cutting, tearing, cleaving, <span id="p42"><sup><small>[ p. 42 ]</small></sup></span> disembowelling, stabbing, gnawing [^1], rupturing, hacking, mutilating, and withering [^2]; such as are all called wounds. 2. The upheaving circular movement of a certain serpent-scourge [^3], the throwing down of the person, and the flow of blood from the bodies of the people.

3\. How the various members are divided into seventy-six that are more particularly called principal, which are comprised in two classes; two of these, which are clothed _and_ different, one from the other, are female, and _some_ out of the surrounding parts (girvôgânîh), which are _apart_ from eight of the principal, that are comprised in the members of the two classes _and_ among those seventy-six—_and_ which, in like manner, are different one from the other—are female, and are _of_ different purpose and different design, one from the other.

4\. These, too, namely, when any one, through an assault, produces, for any other, stupefaction, swelling, or leanness, blackness [^4], or paleness, shortness, or tallness, want of intelligence, much eating, little eating, or moderate eating, indolence, or diligence, or dulness of hearing; or he wishes to speak _some_ words, and they strike him in return; or _one_ altogether diminishes _any_ one's speech, sight, _or_ hearing, <span id="p43"><sup><small>[ p. 43 ]</small></sup></span> wisdom, strength, _or_ semen, milk, _or_ pregnancy; _or_ when _one_ destroys the spleen (s<i>p</i>ur) or milk of females, or, in revenge (gî<i>f</i>ar), kills _his_ son outright; _or_ when they would inflict a wound upon a wound, and one's blood goes streaming forth.

5\. Also about an assault with one, two, or three weapons, or more, in conjunction; or they may commit _it_ on the spot, or in confederacy, or as a first offence [^5]. 6. About the measure of a wound when a two-edged sword (dôbarakŏ) plunges down, the area (sarâî), walls, and surroundings, and the shape which is plunged; that _which_ is hacked, or cleft, or mutilated, or a torrent _of_ blood streaming; the affliction (vamang) of the furious serpent-scourge (mârvanô) [^6], and the length, glitter, and weight of the weapon.

7\. The ritual for the departure of a wound and the departure of pain, watching over _it for_ the duration of three nights _or_ a year, _its_ greater wretchedness _or_ less wretchedness, _its_ cure (s<i>p</i>ôrîkîh) or incurableness, and whatever is on the same subject. 8. Trivial enumerations, and decisions upon each separately.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (42:1) Or, perhaps, khvâyi<i>s</i>nŏ (compare Pers. ‘<i>h</i>âyîdan) may mean ‘biting.’

[^2]: (42:2) The last four terms are, in Pahlavi: <i>s</i>kôni<i>s</i>nŏ, khûr<i>d</i>ŏ ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>anŏ, tâshî<i>d</i>anô, and khû<i>s</i>înî<i>d</i>anô.

[^3]: (42:3) The mâr-ganô (Av. khrafstraghna), we are told in Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 6, ‘may be _made_ of anything, _but_ a leathern _one_ is good’ (see also Bd. XXVIII, 22). Intended as a snake-killer, it was misused as a scourge for human beings.

[^4]: (42:4) Assuming that vê<i>s</i>îh, ‘excess,’ is a miswriting of siyahîh.

[^5]: (43:1) These three modes are expressed by Pâz. ithrih, hidhih, and apavarâvar<i>s</i>tih, which stand evidently for the original Avesta words ithra, hadha, and apaurvavar<i>s</i>ta (see Chap. XXI, 6).

[^6]: (43:2) See § 2.
