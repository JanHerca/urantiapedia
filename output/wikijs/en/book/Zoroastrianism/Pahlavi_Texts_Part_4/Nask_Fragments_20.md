## EXTANT FRAGMENTS. XX. HÂ<i>D</i>ÔKHT NASK [^1].

It is doubtful how much of this Nask is still extant. Traditionally, the two fragments published by Westergaard as Yt. XXI, XXII (excepting XXII, 37-42), and by Haug as Hn. I, II, III, are said to belong to this Nask; but no allusion to Hn. II, III can be found in the account given in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, and Hn. I can be traced in that account only by assuming that the Ahunavair is therein mentioned (in § 1) instead of its accompanying Ashem-vohû, as it appears to be in Hn. I, 4. In Yt. XI we also appear to have a form of the Srôsh Ya<i>s</i>t derived from the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask, or used in the liturgy when that Nask was recited, and this Ya<i>s</i>t likewise refers (in § 3) to the Ahunavair in similar terms to those used in Hn. I, 4.

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 1, refers to the passage which contained the statement about the Ahunavair already mentioned and also thus quoted in Sls. <span id="p483"><sup><small>[ p. 483 ]</small></sup></span> XII, 19:—‘It says in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht that of the sayings which are spoken out the Ahunavair is that _which is_ most triumphant.’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 4, refers to the passage which probably contained the statements thus quoted in the _Â<i>f</i>rî_n-i Gahanbâr, 14-19 (Sp.), concerning the righteous gifts to be given away, for the sake of the soul, at each of the six season-festivals:—‘There is an Avesta witness manifest in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht from the passage (_in the case of the Maidhyô-zaremaya festival_): "Hazangrem maêshinãm daênunãm paitiputhranãm narãm ashaonãm ashaya vanghuya urunê para-daithyâ<i>d</i>, aêvahê hâtãm <i>k</i>inmânahê ya<i>d</i> ashahê vahi<i>s</i>tahê."’ During the other five festivals the gifts, instead of ewes, are to be cows, mares, camels, and all kinds of herds and seeds, respectively, as appears from the corresponding passages. All six passages, mingled with further Avesta text, occur in several MSS. of the Âfrîngân-i Gahanbâr (see the earlier part of each section of Af. Gab. 7-12, ed. Geldner).

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 9, probably refers to the passage which contained the statement thus quoted in Sd. XL, 4:—‘In the commentary of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht it says:—"Mâ âzârayôi<i>s</i>, Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! mâ Pourushaspem, mâ Dughdhovãm [^1], mâ aêthrapaiti<i>s</i>:—It is not desirable that thou, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _shouldst_ distress _thy_ father, _or_ mother, _or_ priest."’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 10, may possibly refer to <span id="p484"><sup><small>[ p. 484 ]</small></sup></span> the passage which contained a statement that is often partially quoted in Pahlavi colophons, and the Avesta text of which constitutes Yas. LXXII, (Gld.); the first part of the statement, with a translation of its Pahlavi version, is here quoted from Mit<i>r</i>ô-<i>â</i>pân's colophon to a volume of miscellaneous Pahlavi texts, usually called the Vi<i>s</i>tâsp-shâhnâmak from the subject of its first text, and written A.D. 1322, in which the writer mentions the source from which he quotes; and the second part is taken from the same writer's colophon to the Yasna MS. K5, written thirteen months later, which is the only known authority for this part of the text:—‘In one passage of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht it is declared that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus:—"Aêvô pa<i>n</i>t<i>a</i>u yô ashahê vispê anyaêshãm apantãm:—one only is the way of righteousness, all those are no ways:—angrahê mainy<i>e</i>us nasi<i>s</i>tãm [^1] daênãm daêvayasnanãm parâ<i>g</i>îtîm ma<i>s</i><i>h</i>yânãm [^2] frâkereitîm:—which the evil spirit of the heretical demon-worshippers, the wizard, has forced on to mankind."’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 13, must refer to the passage which contained the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XIII, 10:—‘The fifteen stanzas of Yâ-<i>s</i><i>h</i>yaothanâ [^3] are for this reason, because it is given for the destruction of those fifteen fiends who are declared in the medical part of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht.’

No allusion to the following seven passages, quoted from this Nask, has been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV:—

In Sls. XII, 30, it is stated that ‘in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht <span id="p485"><sup><small>[ p. 485 ]</small></sup></span> it says that a woman who shall be reverent is to be considered as much as she who is suitable.’

In Sls. XIII, 6, it is said that ‘the twenty-two stanzas of Tâ-v<i>e</i>\-urvâtâ [^1] are the twenty-two judgments of which it speaks in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht thus: “Anaomô mananghê daya vîspâi kva, kva parô?—Lodging in the judge, that while _he has_ twenty-two judgments _he may be_ more just.”’

In Sd. XXII, 3, 4, it is stated that ‘in the commentary of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht it says, that every one who performs intercession, and extracts anything from a person on their account, and conveys _it_ to them is as much without dishonesty towards them, as he who may have given to them out of his own property. And _in_ the spiritual _existence_ they take account of that profit for him, and just as they make _out_ the account of the good work of that person who may have given _it_, even so much is his good work.’

In Vi<i>g</i>. p. 12, it is said, with reference to Aharman, ‘_that_ he is a creature _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is manifest from the Avesta _of_ the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht: "Dâta, Ahura spe<i>n</i>ta! Mazd<i>a</i>u."’

In Vi<i>g</i>. pp. 23-25, it is said that, 'if any one passes away from the bodily existence, as much of his wealth comes to his son, wife, and daughter as is declared by the Avesta _of_ the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht [^2]:—"Âa<i>d</i> yêzi avi hê anguhê astvai<i>n</i>ti, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!—So if in that bodily existence, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t!—narãm vâ nâirinãm vâ para-irithyâ<i>d</i>,—_of_ males or <span id="p486"><sup><small>[ p. 486 ]</small></sup></span> females _one_ expires,—<i>k</i>va<i>d</i> aêtaêshãm y<i>a</i>unghuyanãm avaretanãm maêthananãm<i>k</i>a vastranãm paiti-raê<i>k</i>yâ<i>d</i>,—however much of their wealth and things, houses and clothing he abandons (that is, he leaves such in this world)—avatha hê <i>h</i><i>v</i>atô puthrem angha<i>d</i>, aêvôbaghem ha<i>k</i>a avaretanãm nisrinuyâ<i>d</i>; âa<i>d</i> yêzi hvãm nâirika bavaiti, aêvô-baghem paiti-nidadhâiti; yêzi dughdhrãm he<i>n</i>ti, naêmem baghem fra<i>g</i>asâ<i>d</i>:—in such _a case, should_ there be a son of his, himself, _one_ delivers up _to him_ one share of the property; if the wife herself (that is, his privileged wife) exists, _one_ gives up _to_ her one _share_ in it; if there are daughters, a half-share comes on to _each of_ them. Âa<i>d</i> yêzi<i>k</i>a hê narô irista hva hizva ukhdhem vâ<i>k</i>em nazdas<i>k</i>a narô danghrem paiti-dyaêti, vîspanãm va<i>k</i>ãm ukhdhanãm<i>k</i>a avi yãm astvaitîm gaêthãm harethrem frabarâ<i>d</i>;—So also, if that dead man gives over a verbal statement by his own tongue _to_ the nearest wise man (that is, speaks his own will), all his words and statements, when in control of _his_ bodily existence, _one_ carries out (that is, _one_ shall confer authority on his words);—yêzi nôid harethrem baraiti anâperetha ha<i>k</i>a <i>s</i><i>h</i>yaothana:—if _one_ shall not confer the authority, he becomes an unpardonable _sinner_ (owing to doing this deed; that is, the person who, when _there_ is a will, does not carry it out).—Ava<i>d</i> ya<i>d</i> hê narô irista aputhrâi angha<i>d</i>, upa hê puthrem fradadhâ<i>d</i>, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! yahma<i>d</i> ha<i>k</i>a puthrô haom urvânem <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> peretûm vîdhârya<i>d</i>:—So when that dead man is without a son (that is, there is no son of his), _one_ gives forth _the share_ over _to_ the son, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! by whom, _as_ a son (that is, an adopted son), they pass on _the man's_ own soul from that <span id="p487"><sup><small>[ p. 487 ]</small></sup></span> <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge (that is, it departs _by_ the passage of the bridge)."'

In Vi;. p. 83, it is said that ‘hair from an ox _or_ a horse is suitable, as _it_ is declared by the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht: "G<i>e</i>us vâ aspahê vâ varesa."’

In Vi<i>g</i>. pp. 144, 145, it is said, with reference to announcing the name of the deceased during the celebration of the Srôsh Ya<i>s</i>t after a death, that ‘_it is_ declared by the Avesta of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht: "Yêzi narô mazdayasnô ha<i>k</i>a gaêthâbyô parairithyêiti, âa<i>d</i> hê nãma hadha pitô frag<i>e</i>urvayâ<i>d</i>; yêzi nâirika para-irithyêiti, âa<i>d</i> ya<i>d</i> hê nãma hadha pathanô uzg<i>e</i>urvayâ<i>d</i>, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! aêtem vâ<i>k</i>em nî a<i>n</i>tare mazdayasnanãm frasastayâ<i>d</i>:—If a man who is a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper passes away from the worldly _existence_, in such _a case one_ holds out his name with _that of_ his father; and if _it be_ a woman who passes away, in such _a case one_ upholds whatever is her name with _that of_ her husband, O Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _one_ shall further bless this statement (that is, _its being_ reverenced is important) among the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, (do thou proclaim and further bless this statement)."’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (482:1) The short account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains 295 Pahlavi words which, according to the proportions adopted in the case of Nask XIII, would represent about 8,400 Avesta and 17,400 Pahlavi words of original text.

[^1]: (483:1) The orthography of these three Avesta names has been amended in accordance with the Persian version accompanying them, but all the four MSS. consulted have the first two in the genitive, and one MS. uses a masculine genitive form also for the third name.

[^1]: (484:1) Only the first and last letters of this word are clearly legible.

[^2]: (484:2) The first syllable is illegible.

[^3]: (484:3) Yas. XXXIV.

[^1]: (485:1) Yas. XXXI.

[^2]: (485:2) It is perhaps necessary to repeat that no attempt is made to correct the Avesta orthography, except in the case of a few obvious misprints.
