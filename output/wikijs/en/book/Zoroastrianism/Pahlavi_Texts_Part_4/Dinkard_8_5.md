## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER V.

1\. Amid the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> [^1] are particulars about the maintenance of action and the production of the <span id="p14"><sup><small>[ p. 14 ]</small></sup></span> beneficial creatures. 2. First, as to the spiritual existence, and how much _and_ how is the maintenance in the spiritual _existence_; and the production of the worldly _existence_ therefrom, qualified _and_ constructed for descending (fitô<i>d</i>anŏ) into the combat with the destroyer, and accomplishing the associated necessity for the end and circumvention (garang) of destructiveness.

3\. The manner _and_ species _of_ the creation of the creatures; also their material _existence_, and the character and use of the races and species; and whatever is on the same subject. 4. The reason for _their_ creation, and for _their_ perfection at last. 5. About the adversity, injury, and misery of those creatures, and their secret (nîhônŏ) resources _and_ means of attacking _and_ annihilating _them; with_ the preservation _or_ disablement (<i>a</i>p<i>î</i><i>k</i>ârînî<i>d</i>anŏ) of the creatures thereby [^2].

6\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect excellence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (13:6) Corresponding to the fourth word, athâ, in the Ahunavair, p. 14 according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the fifth Nask in other Rivâyats. Dâmdâ<i>d</i> means ‘the creatures produced,’ and it is called Dvâzdah-hâmâst (or humâst) in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained thirty-two kardah, or subdivisions. No further particulars of this and the subsequent Nasks are given by the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, beyond the contents of this eighth Book.

[^2]: (14:1) So far as this brief account of the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> goes, it corresponds very well with much of the contents of the Bundahi<i>s</i>. Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, in his Selections, IX, 1, 16, also quotes the Dâmdâ<i>d</i> as the authority for certain details contained in the Bundahish, which work must therefore be considered as derived from this Nask. It is very probable, however, that the Nask contained much more information than is here hinted, because the author's usual plan, in these brief summaries, is evidently to confine his remarks to a few of the details near the beginning of each Nask.
