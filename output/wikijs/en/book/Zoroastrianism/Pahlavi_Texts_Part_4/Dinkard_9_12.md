## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XII.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The eleventh fargar<i>d</i>, the Yasna [^1], is about the assembly of the angels of the spiritual _existences_ on account of the complaint of fire; and the complaint of fire in the assembly, with _its_ statement of this, too [^2]: ‘I am not _of the world_ here, and from here I _will_ extricate _myself_, from the earth up to the sky, and there I _will_ shine on to the earth of seven regions, like the moon and sun and even the divinely-produced stars when they shine with their own light.’ 2. The words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> about the just complaining of fire as regards the contamination [^3] of the creatures, the impossibility of keeping the fire undisturbed, and satisfying the fire concerning the creation of the creatures for the worldly _existence, along_ with the disturbed condition of fire, too, owing to the impossibility of maintaining [^4] the uncreated state which, with the freedom from disturbance of fire also, was better; _likewise_ proclaiming the care _of it_. 3. And the speech of the fire _was_ thus: ‘If _there be_ not that one mode whereby I _may_ thus shine, owing to those that _have_ acted according to my request [^5], thou art aware, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! _there_ <span id="p190"><sup><small>[ p. 190 ]</small></sup></span> _are some_ among the creatures that I cannot grant so much _to_; therefore carry me away, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! then give me away there! and be thou carrying _me_ away into the midst of Aîrân-v<i>ê</i><i>g</i> [^1]!’

4\. The propitious [^2] fire is from the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and it is produced by him in a dwelling, without _being_ handled (ba<i>r</i>â sû<i>d</i>akŏ) [^3], by aid of bringing together [^4]. 5. And so he spoke in words thus: ‘Such is thine own growth, thou who art my fire! in every dwelling where thou comest, and _in_ every village, every community, and every province; and as exalted as thou are the water and plants, and _he_, too, who is a guardian spirit of the righteous, when they shall bring forward holy-water for delivering up _to_ thee [^5]; _and_, when they shall bring forward to thee firewood which is dry, a person—through the light which he observes—_has_ spoken of it thus: "This is the Gû<i>s</i>n-as<i>p</i> [^6] fire."’

6\. About so much reward of the hewer and inspector and kindler of the firewood—when all three shall do _it_ for the sake of affection—as _they_ <span id="p191"><sup><small>[ p. 191 ]</small></sup></span> _are_ possessing righteousness. 7. About the character _and_ reward of the washer (âsnôtâr) and the producer of the purity and cleansing of that which the fire _has_ dropped [^1], _of_ the introducer of the firewood and the washer upwards [^2], _of_ the stirrer of the fire and the carrier-away of the firewood, who are strictly directed; the lawful work done with a _cooking-_pot _and_ such-like, and the sin of him who is a disturber of it. 8. About the destroyer of that which the fire _has_ dropped, and the introducer of damp firewood into it. 9. About the blessing of fire for people by whom _it is_ satisfied.

10\. About advice as regards not bringing to the fire that which is due to theft, _or_ the power of extortion, and the grievous bridge-judgment [^3] of him who is bringing _it; also_ the defilement (âlû<i>d</i>an) and hurting of the fire from that which _occurs_ when he likewise consecrates his hoard (hanbari<i>s</i>nŏ), owing to the corruption by the demons [^4] thus arisen. 11. This, too, that _it is_ owing to want of attention to fire when _it is_ not at every menstrual excitement they produce, _in_ a woman assisted by a propensity <span id="p192"><sup><small>[ p. 192 ]</small></sup></span> for a son (pûs ra<i>d</i>îh), _that_ the progeny is a son. 12. And about the penalty for [^1] the progress of other impropriety which occurs to fire; also _about_ the person who has attained to the guardianship of fire and does not lawfully control _it_.

13\. About an admonition to Zaratû<i>s</i>t as to consecrating _to_ the sacred beings anything whatever which _one_ eats, and not eating _what is_ unconsecrated. 14. About the wish of the evil spirit that no one shall be performing (vadîdûnâñ-â<i>d</i>ŏ) worship and obeisance to the sacred beings, and _that the people_ shall possess no ruler and high-priest, so that no desire of theirs shall arise for any virtuousness. 15. About an admonition as to indispensably worshipping the sacred beings with the best ceremonial, that of a priest (âsrûkŏ) without sin; _or with_ an average _one_, that of a priest whose sin is not more than one Aredû<i>s</i> [^2] without a basis (<i>a</i>\-bûn); _or with_ the lowest _one_, that of a priest whose _sin_ is not more than one Khôr [^3] on a basis (pavan bûn). 16. Whoever, in a village of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, _has_ not chanted the _sacred_ hymns after fifteen years _of age_, through sinfulness, is as a dog they _have_ thrown provisions _to_, and it _has_ occurred for a basis of the sin of unseasonable chattering [^4]; also the inadmissibility of his soul by Mânsarspend [^5], <span id="p193"><sup><small>[ p. 193 ]</small></sup></span> 17\. About the coming of Ast-vîdâ<i>d</i> [^1], at all times, to mortals whom death has reached [^2], and also whom _it has_ not. 18. About the ideas of the wicked, that the best existence does not exist, _that_ the production of the renovation _of the universe_ does not occur, _that there are_ no dead whom they raise up thereby, and _it is_ not that change _one_ attains. 19. This, too, that is false, for the same _reason_ they observe, _being_ wicked; because the best existence exists, _there_ occurs a production of the renovation which is good, they raise up the dead thereby, and thus _one_ attains that change.

20\. About an admonition as to not making lamentation and weeping over those passed away; and, after the passing away of every righteous _one_ of the religion to the spirits, _one_ is not to augment the distress of the very spirit of life by making lamentation and weeping over the departed. 21. And this, too, that the guardian spirits of the righteous claim no lamentation and weeping after their own ceremonial and the blessing of righteous men. 22. This, too, that the body of every one is not of like will with the soul; food is the desire of the body, and also a store of wealth; righteous action is the desire of the soul, and also the gifts which they give away.

23\. About an enquiry of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t as to who it is who has banished (<i>â</i>pârinî<i>d</i>ŏ) all goodness and perfection from his own _self, but_ thinks _them_ not banished, and does not complain of <span id="p194"><sup><small>[ p. 194 ]</small></sup></span> that loss [^1]. 24. And the reply of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, that it is he _who_ is deceived [^2] by his own tongue through the utterance of words, so that, through speaking falsely, he has become worthy of death. 25. This, too, that for him it is the weapon of the evil spirit; _even_ so complete mindfulness is the reign of Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^3], and thus a liar is more a power for the religion when a man, on account of dulness of thought, _gives_ no reply, so that he _may_ not speak falsely through dulness of thought.

26\. This, too, that he worships the demons with thousand-fold holy-water, who establishes him who is not a member of the community [^4] in the Zôti duty [^5], sooner than him who is a wise Zôti. 27. And this, too, that thou shouldst fetch him who is a member of the community for the Zôti duty, not him who is not a member of the community, for thus thy advance is to the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânŏ). 28. Also this, that a bad Zôti is worse from the Zôti duty.

29\. This, too, that that which is the earliest controller (ayûkhtâr) of sin is thought _which_ is subdued [^6], then forgiveness, then shame, and then listening; and, afterwards, through the sinfulness of the fiend [^7], <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> _one_ becomes a promise-breaker. 30. This, too, that they shall bring every man who is a wounder before the convocation _composed of_ any priest who is a controller of recitation (srâyi<i>s</i>nŏ ayûkhtâr), any priest who is of the district (âdehîk), any priest who is of an out-district (aû<i>z</i>dehîk), and any priest who is _the man's_ own kinsman.

31\. ‘Thus say I unto thee, O Spîtâmân! let _there be_ no breach of promise; neither when the conversation, that they would make a support, _was_ with the wicked, and there is no great judiciousness in it; nor when _it was_ with those of thine own religion, the righteous, as to anything _of_ great judiciousness; because both of them are promises, both _with_ the wicked and the righteous [^1].’

32\. It is the excellence _of_ righteousness _that is_ perfect.

VIII, Chap. IX, 3, and S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 393, 396.
