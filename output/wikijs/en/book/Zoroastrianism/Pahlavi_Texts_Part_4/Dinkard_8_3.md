## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER III.

1\. The Var<i>s</i>tmânsar [^1] _contains_ particulars about the birth of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, his attaining the religion [^2], _and_ whatever is on the same subject [^3]. 2. A notice (numâ<i>d</i>) of the priestliness, discipleship, spiritual lordship, priestly authority, and steadfastness which are in his original more concise words of the Gâthas [^4]. 3. The explanation (zand) of the statements about everything and also the good arrangement (khu<i>s</i>ra<i>d</i>akŏ) are such as that which _one_ speaks of thus:—‘_It_ is the Var<i>s</i>tmânsar which has given forth an exposition upon every_thing_.’ 4. So that, in the Var<i>s</i>tmânsar, something is said about every_thing_ that is mentioned in the Gâthas.

5\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (12:1) Corresponding to the second word, ahû, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the third Nask in other Rivâyats. Var<i>s</i>tmânsar means ‘used as spells, or employed as liturgy,’ and is often corrupted into Vahi<i>s</i>t-mânthrah in the Rivâyats. For a detailed account of the contents of each of its twenty-three fargar<i>d</i>s see Bk. IX, Chaps. XXIV-XLVI.

[^2]: (12:2) See Bk. IX, Chap. XXIV.

[^3]: (12:3) This final phrase is often used for unspecified details, and may be considered as equivalent to _et caetera_.

[^4]: (12:4) See Bk. IX, Chap. XXV.
