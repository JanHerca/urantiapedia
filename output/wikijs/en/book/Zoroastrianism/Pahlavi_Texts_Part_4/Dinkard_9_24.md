## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. Of the Var<i>s</i>tmânsar [^1] there are twenty-three fargar<i>d</i>s, _and_ the first is the Aêthrapaiti<i>s</i> [^2], on the asking of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, by Maî<i>d</i>ôk-mâh [^3], about the nature of the birth of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and his coming to the religion. 2. And the reply of Zaratû<i>s</i>t about the combative coming together of the life-causing and death-causing spirits at his birth [^4]. 3. This, too, that when the fellow-villagers [^5] of her who bore _him_ saw his head [^6]

<span id="p227"><sup><small>[ p. 227 ]</small></sup></span>

_they_ considered _it_ the shoulder _of_ [^7] Arekdvîksûr [^8], _and his_ chest and back _those of_ Aharî<i>s</i>vang [^9], _and_ when _they saw_ his full [^10] bosom _they considered it that of_ the spirit of liberality [^11]; and by _his_ side _was_ the Kayân glory [^12] to rub (mû<i>s</i>tanŏ) his bosom.

4\. The speaking of Zaratû<i>s</i>t spiritually, on the grievous bringing forth of _his_ head [^13], thus: ‘As a spiritual lord is _my_ desire, do thou who art the Zôti speak forth to me [^14];’ and the reply from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘So shouldst thou be the priestly master as regards whatever righteousness I speak forth with righteous intelligence; thou art of very much value, thou _art_ very righteous, thou _art_ most intelligent, and thou _wilt_ state the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers to creatures of every kind.’ 5. Through that saying an arrow reaches spiritually unto the demons, just as from a mighty chief warrior of Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^15], like him in a mountain dwelling (garânŏ mân) who _has_ shot an arrow for an attack (patkopi<i>s</i>nŏ) opposing those in coats of mail. 6. The evil spirit grumbled (dandî<i>d</i>ŏ) to the demons thus: ‘Evil _has_ it become _for_ you _who_ are demons, but <span id="p228"><sup><small>[ p. 228 ]</small></sup></span> you are unobservant.’ 7. Even so Zaratû<i>s</i>t proclaimed life _free_ from the control of the demons, when this same _saying was_ uttered by him, thus: ‘As a spiritual lord is _my_ desire;’ and, _at_ the falling of the demons upon Zaratû<i>s</i>t for _his_ destruction, an incarnation (tanû) of _its_ spiritual existence stood opposed to them, in that weapon _proceeding_ from Zaratû<i>s</i>t, to keep them back.

8\. And he spoke again thus: ‘The religion of the benefiters progresses there in him who, through good actions, _has_ joyfulness owing to his righteousness [^16];’ and, through that saying, an arrow reaches spiritually unto the demons, equal to ten _of_ that which _was_ first spoken, and, _at_ the falling of the demons upon Zaratû<i>s</i>t for _his_ destruction, it stood spiritually opposed to them, and that weapon _proceeding_ from Zaratû<i>s</i>t kept _them_ back.

9\. The third utterance of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, on the bringing forth of _his_ arms, _was_ thus: ‘That which the first existence produced is to be so practised, with attention, through actions to be concealed _by_ him who is a priestly authority (ra<i>d</i>ŏ) [^17];’ and through that saying an arrow reaches spiritually unto the demons, equal to one hundred _of_ that which _was_ first spoken, and, _at_ the falling of a demon upon Zaratû<i>s</i>t for _his_ death, _its_ spirit, _as_ a sacred being, kept the demon away from Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

10\. And, when the whole body of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _was_ brought forth, trouble (âsipŏ) fell among the demons, and the demons rushed back to hell in haste; light <span id="p229"><sup><small>[ p. 229 ]</small></sup></span> increased among the creatures, and every creature of the beneficent sacred being is pleased and talked of virtuous conduct. 11. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> took away Zaratû<i>s</i>t with joyfulness to provide security for _him_, and Arekdvîksûr, Aharî<i>s</i>vang, and the primitive and Kayân glory _in_ the body of Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke to Zaratû<i>s</i>t of _its_ production _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘Thou shouldst think of him who is wise.’ 12. Thereupon Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke spiritually, _in_ reply, thus: ‘I am a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper, I profess the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^18]; _and_ this _means_ that I am an apostle of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and am sent _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.’

13\. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘_As to_ the sacred beings _of_ the worldly _existence_, do thou beg companionship from them; _but as to_ the demons, do thou long for (dôsh) [^19] separation from every one of them; practise good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and abstain from evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.’ 14. Also about vigilantly reverencing the sacred beings, and the reward thereof; not strengthening the vile, nor weakening [^20] the good; expounding _for_ the disturber of religion (dênô-pa<i>d</i>rêsh), and producing liberality for the accepters of religion; and not turning _away_ from the religion on account of fondness for body and life.

15\. The accepting of such advice spiritually _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and his glorifying Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, for creativeness, <span id="p230"><sup><small>[ p. 230 ]</small></sup></span> sovereignty, and all goodness, and the primary archangels _and_ other good creations, each separately, for their own special glory [^21]. 16. And, afterwards, the grumbling of the evil spirit maliciously, at that vexation, thus: ‘I have produced, for the annoyance [^22] of _any_ upholder of that religion of thine, 99,999 wizards, 99,999 wolf-worshippers [^23], and 99,999 apostates.’

17\. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘Maintain this religion steadfastly, for through the assistance of this religion I, who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _will_ be with thee, and the omniscient wisdom becomes thine, and extends to thy disciples, Maî<i>d</i>ôk-mâh [^24], Parsha<i>d</i>\-gâvô [^25], <i>S</i>ênô [^26], Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, Frashô<i>s</i>tar, and <i>G</i>âmâsp [^27], the teacher of public observance and will to the righteous, _besides_ many of the people who are diligent and even those who are idle, and their good works and praise _will_ be owned by thee.’ 18. Likewise <span id="p231"><sup><small>[ p. 231 ]</small></sup></span> about the worldly display of the religion to Zaratû<i>s</i>t _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the accepting of the religion _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t through recitation and faith, and the reverence of the Ahunavair [^28] _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

19\. Also about Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _having_ created the creatures in the spiritual _existence, and_ their allotment out to the worldly _existence_, the superiority of the righteous man as compared with other creatures, and, among mankind, _of_ him who is relying on the provisions of the law and _its_ unchangeableness from goodness, _and_ who is a teacher and provider of teaching _as to_ the pre-eminent existence of the good religion of the sacred beings.

20\. And a summary about the bringing together of that fire which is the residue of a fire in a house, for the reverence of that water which is nearest to the dwelling, and _of_ any spirit of a kinsman; and as _to him_ who leaves that fire, water, and spirit, and, on account of a similar desire, reverences another fire, water, and spirit, _but_ none of them can accept that ceremonial, and the acceptance of that man's ceremonial _by_ the others _will_ have occurred just when the _former_ three are reverenced by him.

21\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (226:1) The second of the Nasks and third of the Gâthic division (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 9, 12). It is a second commentary on the Gâthas, devoting a fargar<i>d</i> to each ha of the Gâthas and to each Gâthic formula, as in the Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask, but beginning with an extra fargar<i>d</i> about the birth and calling of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. Its chief object appears to be the quotation of texts, both from the Gâthas and from sources no longer known.

[^2]: (226:2) Here written asrapâitô<i>s</i> (B) and asrapâîti<i>s</i> (K) in Pahlavi, which, no doubt, stand for Av. aêthrapaiti<i>s</i>, Pers. hêrbad, ‘a Zoroastrian priest.’ This name may either refer to the general subject of the fargar<i>d</i>, or have been the first word of its Avesta text; as it seems not intended to quote any section of the Yasna, although the guardian spirits of the priests are reverenced in Yas. XXVI, 7, 8, before commencing the recitation of the Gâthas.

[^3]: (226:3) Av. Maidhyô-m<i>a</i>ungha; he was first cousin of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and also his first disciple (see Bd. XXXII, 2, 3; Zs. XI, 10 n).

[^4]: (226:4) B has ‘at the birth of his life.’

[^5]: (226:5) B has ham-vîsagîh, K ham-disagîh.

[^6]: (226:6) Assuming that vagânŏ stands for vag<i>d</i>ânŏ, which word occurs in § 4, according to K.

[^7]: (227:1) B omits ‘the shoulder _of_.’

[^8]: (227:2) Av. Aredvî sûra of Yt. V, a title of Anâhita, the female angel of the waters.

[^9]: (227:3) See Bk. VIII, Chap. IX, 3.

[^10]: (227:4) Pahl. aûrûks<i>p</i>ar = Av. uruthware.

[^11]: (227:5) Av. Rita, who is associated with the archangel Spe<i>ñ</i>ta-Ârmaiti in Yt. II, 3, 8; Sîr. I, II, 5, and with Ashi Vanguhi in Yt. XXIV, 8.

[^12]: (227:6) Av. kavaêm <i>h</i><i>v</i>arenô (see Chap. XXII, 7).

[^13]: (227:7) B has ‘whenever his birth occurred.’

[^14]: (227:8) This, with the first clause of the response, is the Pahlavi version of the concluding formula of Yas. XXVI, 11, without the extra Pahlavi glosses.

[^15]: (227:9) See Bk. VIII, Chaps. XI, 5-4, XIII, 15.

[^16]: (228:1) This is the Pahlavi version of Yas. XXXIV, 13 b, without the glosses.

[^17]: (228:2) This is the Pahlavi version of Yas. XXXIII, 1 a, b, without the glosses and incomplete.

[^18]: (229:1) This is the Pahlavi version of part of Yas. XII, 7, 8 (XIII, 25 Sp.) without the glosses.

[^19]: (229:2) B has ‘hope for’ (nyôsh).

[^20]: (229:3) Assuming that nizôrinî<i>d</i>anŏ (K) stands for nizârînî<i>d</i>anŏ; B has zôrînî<i>d</i>anŏ, which is synonymous with the previous nîrûkînî<i>d</i>anŏ, ‘strengthening.’

[^21]: (230:1) Or it may be ‘in his own particular soul (nisman).’

[^22]: (230:2) Pahl. rêshî<i>d</i>ârîh, which B omits.

[^23]: (230:3) This term, gûrg-ya<i>z</i>akŏ (= Av. vehrkayâza), does not occur in the extant Avesta.

[^24]: (230:4) See § 1.

[^25]: (230:5) Av. Parsha<i>d</i>\-g<i>a</i>u of Yt. XIII, 96 (compare Piz. Par<i>s</i>adgâ of Bd. XXIX, 5). This name can also be read Fradâ<i>d</i>ayânŏ and be compared with Av. Fradhidaya of Yt. XIII, 97.

[^26]: (230:6) Av. Saêna of Yt. XIII, 97, who is said to have ‘first set forth upon this earth with a hundred disciples.’ Further details about him are given in Chap. XXXIII, 5. In the third and seventh books of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> his name is written <i>S</i>ênôv (for <i>S</i>ênôk or <i>S</i>ênôê) which has been read Dâyûn by Peshotan (Dk. pp. 308-314 of English translation), as pointed out by Darmesteter in his _Textes Pehlvis relatifs au Judaisme_, p. 3, n. 2. In Dk. VII he is said to have been a high-priest who was born in the 100th year of the religion, and died in its 200th year.

[^27]: (230:7) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 68.

[^28]: (231:1) See Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7.
