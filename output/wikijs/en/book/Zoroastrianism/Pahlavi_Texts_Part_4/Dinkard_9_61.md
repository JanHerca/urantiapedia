## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LXI.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The fifteenth fargar<i>d</i>, Kamnamaêza [^1], is about the reply of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, as to that which _was_ asked by him thus: ‘To which lands do I step [^2]?’ _and_ it is _thus:_ ‘Do thou march (sagîtûn) there where the man, in whose person righteousness is _connected_ with complete mindfulness, is welcome; this, too, is where happy is he from whom there is no complaint.’

2\. This, too, that mankind are made diligent in good works by him who produces progress for good works; even for this reason, because mankind attain progress _in_ manifest duty who engage more particularly _in_ good works. 3. This, too, that the teaching of religion is the public action which is prescribed by him who would produce exertion for the righteous, that is, benefit for those of the good religion; even for this reason, because the multitude (kabedân) approach the religion, and are taught and practise _it_, on account of a desire _for_ benefit. 4. This, too, that _it is_ in a province of even exhausted production [^3] that it is taught by him who appoints a virtuous governor over the province; even for this reason, because a virtuous governor of a province becomes a teacher of ability and good works to those of the province. <span id="p368"><sup><small>[ p. 368 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. This, too, that the good protection of fire [^4] is taught by him whose words are through Vohûman, _and_ who also would provide a time for the ordeal of that which is doubtful; even for this reason, because _he_ whose words are utterable through Vohûman, _and_ who would provide a time _for_ the ordeal of that which is doubtful, teaches the provision of care _for_ the operative fire, owing to that _which occurs_ when _what is_ accomplished, about one acquitted _or_ convicted _by_ the fire, is declared, _and_ mankind shall provide more particularly for the brilliancy of the fire, and the wicked more _for_ assistance and protection from it.

6\. This, too, that whoever shall provide about him who liberally gives _him_self in discipleship [^5] unto the priests, has thereby taught even by the mention of the high-priest; even for this reason, because the person _being_ given in discipleship unto the priests, the religion practised by the high-priest arises also _for_ mention, _and_ whoever shall provide generosity for that person, has increased _and_ also taught that action, which is religion, even by the mention made. 7. This, too, that men and women [^6] are taught _as being_ given in discipleship [^7] to Zaratû<i>s</i>t by him who keeps his own males and females in the control of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 8. This, too, that goodness is taught by him to those (valman) who are good, so that they produce it who give to that righteous _one_ the worthiness which is through that wealth; the righteous _one_ who is worthy is _one_ of the good religion for whose production of the worthiness which is through that wealth it is sought, and that wealth which is <span id="p369"><sup><small>[ p. 369 ]</small></sup></span> coveted is wealth of little trouble _and_ much advantage, through the goodness and idea of virtue of the giver to the account of him who is the accepter of the good worthiness. 9. This, too, that through his <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> passage (<i>K</i>i<i>s</i>\-vi<i>d</i>arg) it is taught that they shall step forth (frôvâmând) [^8]; _and_ by him who goes on through anything (<i>k</i>is) openly, when he _has_ proceeded publicly on the right path, _one_ passed _away_ on the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> passage is taught.

10\. This, too, that by him whose ceremonial is through complete mindfulness it is taught that the world produces abundance through complete mindfulness [^9]; even for this reason, because it is taught by him, through that disposition of his _for_ the sacred beings (pavan zak-1 valman ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ânŏ khîm), _that_ the developed world is shown _to be_ theirs; _and_ here _below_ it is fully taught by him, _that_ Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> and Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^10]—that is, the sacred beings—produce _it_ for the benefiters. 11. This, too, that thus he who is wicked, even he who is privileged, becomes unprivileged at that time when every one understands, that is, when righteousness is aloft. 12. This, too, that when he who is privileged is Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^11], likewise he who is privileged is the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^12], _and_ so he who is the wicked Ar<i>g</i>âsp [^13] is unprivileged.

13\. This, too, that creation is taught by him to <span id="p370"><sup><small>[ p. 370 ]</small></sup></span> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, so that he creates, and this, too, that the archangels are taught by his will, whose contentment [^14] is through that of the archangels, so that he observes the conclusion in the affairs of the archangels. 14. And this, too, that wisdom is taught to him who is Zaratû<i>s</i>t—so that it becomes his—by him whose thoughts are for Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^15] _and_ for the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

15\. Perfect is the excellence _of_ righteousness.
