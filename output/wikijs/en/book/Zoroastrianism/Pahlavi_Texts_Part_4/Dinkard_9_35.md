## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXXV.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The twelfth fargar<i>d</i>, the Yasna [^1], is about the manifestation of good thoughts, good words, _and_ good deeds by the religion [^2]; the lodgment of the religion in good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; _and_ whoever possesses good thoughts, whoever _has_ good words, _and_ whoever _has_ good deeds, by him righteousness and the reward of the righteous are possessed. 2. This, too, that neither is he, who is not to be born _for_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, an issue from parents who are not righteous, nor yet is he, for him, who is a manifestation of the righteous.

3\. This, too, _is said_, namely: ‘Thou shouldst give a glad-thinking desire _for_ a spiritual lord, and an easy-bodied constitution, to their minds, the religion which I spoke forth _to_ thee; so that the greatest, best, and most beneficial of existences [^3], that _are_ those which cattle _are_ wanting from men, _are_ water, pasture, and freedom from danger [^4]; _and_ those which men _are wanting_ from cattle are also food and clothing.’ 4. This, too, that that which mankind ought to give to the sacred beings is a power for completeness _of_ control; and that which the sacred beings ought to give to men is ever that which is good for them. 5. And this, too, that thou who _art_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> also suppliest _it_ from those sacred beings, and _thou who art_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t also teachest _it_ thoroughly to that best-ruling sovereignty [^5] and authority. <span id="p266"><sup><small>[ p. 266 ]</small></sup></span> 6\. This, too, _is said_, namely: ‘Let no _one_ practise ill-perpetrated deeds, even though in a wilderness when far from publicity, nor in distress, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! because Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the observer of everything, is aware of them; and the rule is _that_ just as any one whatever _of_ the embodied existence thinks, speaks, _and_ practises, so great is his punishment.’ 7. And this, too, that the best ceremonial and obeisance [^1] are the ceremonial _and_ obeisance of a righteous man.

8\. About begging for life and receiving _it, there_ is this, that _it is_ customarily due to two methods (babâ): one, through leadership of righteousness [^2], is that _through_ which _it_ is evident that _it is_ owing to virtuousness; and one, through service of righteousness [^2], is that which is not an evidence that _it is_ owing to viciousness. 9. About _the case_ where virtuousness is producing authority over truth, and truth over the tongue, so that thou speakest words through the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 10. And this, too, _is said_, namely: ‘I am the propitious spirit who _was at_ first _and_ ever _will be_, and am not really deceived by anything.’

11\. About fire _being_ given _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> for shelter and assistance _by_ the protection of mankind; _its_ maintenance and assistance _by_ mankind; and the openheartedness of the spirit of fire for him who shall perform obeisance to it, and for him who is to perform obeisance to it [^3]. 12. The work which is the greatest that exists, _and_ is accomplished in the future existence [^4], whereby the creatures become pure, <span id="p267"><sup><small>[ p. 267 ]</small></sup></span> occurs through fire; _and one_ prays _for it_ for the sake of the requirements which mankind acquired from the sacred beings. 13. This, too, _is said_, namely: 'Since thou _art_ thus, ‘<i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! most propitiatory, that is, able to perform most for our pleasure, we are more promptly coming than Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar _was_ able to come, when thou beggest of us who are archangels, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^1]!’

14\. About Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s exhibiting the creatures in the future existence to Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 15. _And_ this, too, namely, the all-brilliance of the earth, the all-brilliance _of_ the cattle, the all-brilliance _of_ the plants, and the all-brilliance _of_ every excellence [^2] which is a manifestation of righteousness. 16. About the worshipping of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by worshippers, through advancing [^3] in the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s covenant (pa<i>d</i>mânŏ), which gave the world his righteousness; also the good protectiveness of his rule, and _of_ the greatness therein, is owing to it [^4], and the name of the ruler is Wisdom [^5]; likewise his ceremonial—performed while the creations owing to him live. when possessing bodies and possessing life [^6]—is a benefit _to_ all the worldly and spiritual _existences_.

17\. And this, too, _is said_, namely: ‘Thou art our own [^7], and also _our_ confederate, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! likewise unto us thou comest with the reverence that is good [^8]; thine, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! are the greatness and completeness in performance [^9], so that they <span id="p268"><sup><small>[ p. 268 ]</small></sup></span> become thy greatness and completeness, that is, they are thine, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! and are boundless onwards from the middle, that is, we give thee a reward [^1] so enormous that, when thou shouldst stand in the middle _of it_, thou _wouldst_ not see to _its_ limits, the width of the earth, the length of a river, and the height of the sun [^2].’

18\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t begged of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘Give unto me him who becomes a disciple of men [^3] of the mighty through meditation for the religion, _of them_ who shall produce the actual progress of this my religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, _and_ who _will_ also explain the good practices to this _one_ of mine, even the blessings set forth _by_ me in the benedictions they possess.’ 19. _And_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘I _will_ give unto thee him who becomes a disciple of other men of the mighty; they are thy kinsmen and those confederates _of_ theirs, and thine are their companions and their serfs [^4], who produce the progress of this thy religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers. 20. Mostly thine, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! are their worship and their homage; and, through their ceremonial and obeisance, the liberality of him who is worshipped is given to thee, _and_ righteousness for the soul is with thee; also thy life exists owing to us, and likewise _thy_ body [^5], <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! 21. Forth to thee _will_ I, who am the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, come in both existences [^6], as assistance; thou becomest worthy, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! through Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> _and_ Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^7], both of them, _and_ through the gratification of <span id="p269"><sup><small>[ p. 269 ]</small></sup></span> me, who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, by those sayings _and_ deeds which I, _who_ am the most propitious of spirits, proclaimed unto thee.’

22\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘They have become applicants on him who is powerful _with_ thee [^1].’ 23. _And_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Thou becomest an applicant and powerful in the embodied existence.’ 24. Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘_Be_ thou a gratification to us in the slow progress _of_ life, _thou_ most beneficent (hû-dahâktûm) of existences! that is, thou shouldst give to us [^2].’ 25. _And_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘I _will_ gratify thee, <i>O</i> righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t! in that best existence [^3].’

26\. Excellence _that_ is perfect _is_ righteousness.
