## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXXIV.

[_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar_](errata_htm.html) _Nask_.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . it is possible to come through virtuous deeds _and_ through virtuous thoughts.' <i>n</i>. And this, too, _he spoke_, namely: ‘That Good Thought [^1] of mine proceeds _and_ notices the thoughts of the embodied existence, _and_ of the good words and the deeds he reports again those referring to me, as often as three times in the same day, both _of those_ who are liberal _to_ thee [^1], <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! and _of those_ who are illiberal to thee.’

<i>o</i>. The struggling of the demons [^2], for the putting down of all benefit from mankind, _has_ not produced the obtainment of their capability for that benefit which arises _for_ mankind through the future existence; so that that one evil is more grievous than every evil which the demons imagine for mankind, when _the latter_ are frightened by them from the way of the sacred beings, and are wicked; and harder for them _are_ the praisers of righteousness among the apostates _and_ the rest _of_ the creation, through _their_ praise of righteousness, even when very many praise _it_.

<i>p</i>. About the progress of Ârmat [^3] and Târôkmat perpetually among the creatures, the disclosure of Ârmat _to_ mankind, and _of_ righteousness _to_ Târôkmat; <span id="p264"><sup><small>[ p. 264 ]</small></sup></span> the listening of that vile Târôkmat to falsehood, and the distance [^4] _of_ righteousness from him who is vile is like _that of_ a sheep fled (sî<i>s</i>d) [^5] from mankind. <i>q</i>. And this, too, that the evil spirit is beaten [^6] by complete mindfulness, in the struggle of those having mighty ones, just as a powerful man beats him who is a reverent creation (nîyâyîn dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) [^7]; _and_ the pure Zaratû<i>s</i>t is produced _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _as well as_ the power of Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> _and_ Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^8] which _acts_ forcibly for giving value (far<i>g</i>) and preparing the creatures.

<i>r</i>. About the opposition of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to the demons [^9], and the valuation of the deeds of mankind _which_ exist for greater jurisdiction [^10] _and_ more advantage of the primitive good creation; and in any doubtfulness _one is_ to perform the ceremonial of the sacred beings. <i>s</i>. About _cases_ where the good-will _of_ the spirit of complete mindfulness makes mankind attain to the good religion; and their spiritual joy [^11] arises from the purification of their own religion through virtuous exercise of will.

<i>t</i>. About the desire _for_ a reward _for_ anything whatever, and the great advantage owing to a reward of the desires _of_ mankind; _also_ the appropriation of the reward through the operation of the sacred beings:—‘Even through the ruler (pa<i>d</i>) of that dominion of yours do I produce the renovation _of_ the existences by _my_ will [^12], I who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.’

<i>u</i>. Excellence is righteousness _that is_ perfect.
