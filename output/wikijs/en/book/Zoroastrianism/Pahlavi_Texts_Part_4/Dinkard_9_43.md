## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XLIII.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The twentieth fargar<i>d</i>, Ka<i>d</i>\-môi-urvâ [^4], is about anything whatever _being_ begged _as_ provision for the soul [^5], and as to the speaking of Shatraver [^6] to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘Thou shouldst think thus, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> assists thee.’ 2. This, too, _is said_, that the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> live through Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^7], are immortal through Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^7], possess complete mindfulness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> through <span id="p292"><sup><small>[ p. 292 ]</small></sup></span> Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^1], and _possess_ him as ruler through Shatraver.

3\. About wealth being _begged_ owing to virtuousness _there_ is this, too, that, to him who, owing to virtuousness, begs that which is not allowed to him owing to the oppressiveness _of_ the vile, or on account of _some_ other opposition, they then give essentially that reward, in the spiritual _existence which is_ greater _and_ better than that wealth. 4. About the cattle suitable _for_ that warrior who possesses virtuous habits _and_ strength [^2], through the assistance of the will of the sacred beings and _for_ the benefit of Irân _and_ the defeat of the diminishing foreign force (kâstârîh-i an-Aîrânŏ).

5\. About the seizure [^3] of mankind for the advancement of the admonition _and_ command _of_ the sacred beings, so far as force is an assistant to them in knowledge due to the sacred beings [^4]; _and_ their appropriation _of_ the best existence through the advancement of that admonition _and_ command. 6. About the assistance of the righteous, on the passage to the best existence, by the spirit of the wisdom of sovereignty, liberality, _and_ truth, Aharî<i>s</i>vang [^5] and the angel Hôm [^6].

7\. About the reason of the three steps walked forward _by_ the Zôti from the place of the Zôti, while uttering the Avesta (<i>a</i><i>v</i>istâkŏ-gôbi<i>s</i>nîhâ), after the <span id="p293"><sup><small>[ p. 293 ]</small></sup></span> end of the ritual for the fire, on delivering (parv<i>â</i><i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) the offering of holy-water to the water [^1], _being_ the leading up of the archangels, always at the end of an assembly of conference _with_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, by three steps from the earth to the sun station, through _the places of_ good thoughts, good words, _and_ good deeds [^2].

8\. Advice to Zaratû<i>s</i>t also as to the nature of the archangels; likewise a reminder to worship on _their_ <span id="p294"><sup><small>[ p. 294 ]</small></sup></span> account after separation from the sight _of them_. 9. And this, too, _is said_, that _there_ arises therefrom a conception (ham-giriftârîh), _by_ him whose disposition and character are sagacious [^1], also as to the adaptation of his own deeds to that nature of his. 10. And about the good affinity of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, even for abundance of good works, _there_ is this, too, namely: ‘So, _for_ all those deeds which _thou hast_ to accomplish, and which are also accomplished, there is reward for thee through their righteousness, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t!’

11\. And about the advice to Zaratû<i>s</i>t _there_ is this, too, namely: ‘_Thou hast_ to become reverent to them [^2], so that mankind _may_ become reverent to thee.’ 12. About considering the time of the days _and_ nights _as_ all for good accumulation in good works _there_ is this, too, that whoever is diligent _and_ always doing good works, _and_ that whoever shall perform as many good works as is possible for him, is given as much reward [^3] as is his desire.

13\. It is righteousness _that is_ perfect excellence.
