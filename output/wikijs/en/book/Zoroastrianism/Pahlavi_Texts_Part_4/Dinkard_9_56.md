## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LVI.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The tenth fargar<i>d</i>, Yâ-<i>s</i><i>h</i>yaothanâ [^2], is _that_, for him who is practising good works [^3] as much as it is possible for him _to do_, an efficacious reason _for_ the renovation _of the universe_ is afforded assistance; even for this reason, when every good work is an assistance _to_ the renovation, then—according to the declaration _that_ whoever _does_ much more good work is more assisting the renovation—by him who is practising good works as much as _it_ is possible for him _to do_, an efficacious reason for the renovation is afforded assistance. 2. This, too, that the apostate [^4], who is the seduction of mankind, is injured by him who devotes himself to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because he is dislodged _and_ is elucidated <span id="p346"><sup><small>[ p. 346 ]</small></sup></span> (adîvâgî-aîtŏ rôshanî-aîtŏ), _and there_ arises a class of mankind _who_ see the admission (parvânakîh) _of_ the apostate into hell, and he is disabled when _it is_ seen by them.

3\. This, too, that by him who is eager [^1] for knowledge, knowledge is grasped _and_ taught; even for this reason, because knowledge is taught through that which is the instruction of every science and the original desire for it, and mankind shall extol his knowledge; it is also coveted by them for _being_ taught, and they mount and grasp _it_. 4. This, too, that to slay [^2] an apostate is taught by the good _one_ who is united (hamî-aît) with a good _man;_ even for this reason, because the destruction (aôsh) of Aharman arises from the union of the good. 5. This, too, that by him who is a disturber (vishûftâr) as to Vohûman the production of development through Vohûmanic rule [^3] is taught; sinners lawfully subjected to the bridge _judgment_ (pûhalînî<i>d</i>ŏ) _for_ Vohûmanic disturbance, and the command for it by rulers and high-priests, being a preparation _for_ the development of the world.

6\. This, too, that a great ordinance [^4] is taught by him whose ceremonial [^5] is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because a comprehension of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and serving him are the foundation of joy (parkân bûn), and the ownership and concentration (hanger<i>d</i>îkîh) of all good works are themselves the great ordinance of the faithful whose preparation is through the ownership, and their welcome is more particularly in the ceremonial; owing to the same <span id="p347"><sup><small>[ p. 347 ]</small></sup></span> reason, the original possession of the great ordinance of the ceremonial which is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s own, and _of_ other good works—even though _relating_ to the ceremonial of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> of every kind owing thereto—is necessary for the manifestation of the great ordinance, and is incorporated (ham-tanû) _with it_ when it becomes manifest as a great ordinance, or as more than a great ordinance; even then its extent (vâli<i>s</i>nŏ) is over this joy. 7. This, too, that the performance (sakhtârîh) of a ceremonial [^1] _of_ the needy is a gift to the worthy of the creation, and a gift to the worthy of the creation is the attraction (hâkhtârîh) of a ceremonial of the needy.

8\. This, too, that the way of righteousness [^2], also that through which that way is seen, _and_ likewise the reward of those lonely-labouring (aêvar’<i>z</i>îkân) therein are taught by him whose deeds arc an advantage _to_ the sacred beings; even for this reason, because the advantage of the sacred beings is the advantage of the multitude, and the advantage of the multitude, which is itself the religion of the sacred beings that is a guide, is the way of righteousness and also that through which is the reward of those lonely-labouring. 9. This, too, that even the reward of a teacher of professionals, which is the profit of the profession, is liberally given and appropriated for the professionals taught; even for this reason, because the business of the sacred beings has profited by the instruction (âmûkŏ).

10\. Excellence _that is perfect_ is righteousness.
