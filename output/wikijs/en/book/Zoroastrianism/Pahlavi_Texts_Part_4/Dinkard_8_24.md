## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XXIV.

_Ganabâ-sar-ni<i>g</i>a_d _Nask_.

1\. The first section of the _last_ thirty-five is the Stôristân (‘_beast-of-burden code_’), particulars about the sin, affecting the soul, due to unlawfully striking and wounding as regards beasts _of burden and_ cattle; _and_ the retribution and compensation for it to one's own cattle, that in case of a beast _of burden and_ that in case of a sheep (anûm<i>â</i><i>ê</i>), during life. 2. That which _arises_ when _one smites_ them with a brand (dakhshak); that when _one_ smites them on the flank, _and_ that when _it is_ in front of them; that <span id="p85"><sup><small>[ p. 85 ]</small></sup></span> when their flanks are so smitten is complete smiting. 3. Of the smiting, too, _of_ other members, the smiting in front, though the smiting _be_ such as when _one_ so smites for smiting on the flank, is not complete smiting. 4. And that which amounts to as much as a complete smiting, when _one_ so smites as for smiting on the flank, is such as that when _one casts off_ the skin, and that when _one_ casts off the flesh, thereby, that when _one_ is cutting it, _or_ that when wounds (khîmân) or serpent-scourging (mârvanô) [^1] are _upon_ it.

5\. It is also about making the dog which drives the sheep (pasû<i>s</i>\-haûrvô) dumb. 6. About bruising the limbs and plucking the feathers of birds, such as the _case_ when _it is_ complete smiting, and such as that when _it is_ not complete smiting. 7. And unlawfully destroying as regards fish, such as when it would make their flesh uneatable. 8. An account as to noticeably and worryingly beating cattle, about decrees of whatever kinds as to each separate beating worryingly that is to be considered as noticeable beating, _and_ many decrees as to whatever is on the same subject. 9. About the retribution for making clothing of skins and woven _wool_ (ta<i>d</i>akŏ), and the sin of any one owing to kindling a fire therewith, _or_ roasting flesh which is stolen _or_ plundered.

10\. About the good work _of_ all that is wise activity, and the reward of the happy place [^2]; the sin of every_thing_ that is ignorant activity, and the <span id="p86"><sup><small>[ p. 86 ]</small></sup></span> bridge _penalty_ of the evil place [^3]; connected therewith, to make him who is righteous develope in wisdom, and to make him who is wicked diminish in ignorance, is the world.
