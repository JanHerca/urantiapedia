## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XLVIII.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The second fargar<i>d</i> is the Ashem [^1] of the Bakân [^2]; it is by it _that_ perfect excellence is produced for every one who produces for any one else that which is suitable for him [^3]; for this reason, because, for the sake of perfect production, _there is_ much unprofitable production, _but_ profitable production is suitably producing. 2. This, too, that the reward of every good work is given by it to mankind, which keeps mankind in diligence when it instructs [^4]; because, as the business _of_ all good works is that which instructs and keeps mankind in diligence, the reward of good works which mankind <span id="p309"><sup><small>[ p. 309 ]</small></sup></span> can appropriate by diligence is appropriated by it. 3. And this, too, that advancement is given by it to every good work [^5].

4\. He who is understanding good works, and _yet_ a suppliant, has thereby made the learned foolish (<i>â</i><i>z</i>ân akhanî<i>d</i>înî<i>d</i>ŏ); whoever possesses authority through virtuousness [^6] is more particularly for rewarding the doers of good works; whoever, too, can make true decision [^7] and adjudication is more particularly for causing the bridge _judgment_ of a criminal, and _for_ thrusting _him_ aside owing to the exhaustion of _his_ good works; and whoever, too, can exercise mediation _and_ wisdom is more particularly for the good government of the world.

5\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect.
