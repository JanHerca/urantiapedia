## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LVIII.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The twelfth fargar<i>d</i>, U<i>s</i>tavaiti [^1], is _that_ the benefit of him who is reverent _to_ the benefiters is the benefit of any one whatever [^2]; even for this <span id="p354"><sup><small>[ p. 354 ]</small></sup></span> reason, because the benefit of the immature creation is owing to carrying _out_ the commands of a benefiting spiritual lord. 2. This, too, that whoever pleases superiors by submission, is pleased by inferiors. 3. This, too, that by him who gives thought to the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, that which is best for his own in every mode [^3] is produced, because he has attained to the religion who is listening best. 4. This, too, that virtue is taught by him to all the creatures of the beneficent spirit, _to_ the righteous whose stepping forth (fravâmi<i>s</i>nŏ) is for the righteous; even for this reason, because the creatures of the beneficent spirit are all _of_ one nature, _and_ the stepping forth (fragâmi<i>s</i>nŏ) and hastening of the limbs of one body become those of the whole of that body. 5. This, too, that his spirit is connected with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^4], and his knowledge is accepted, who loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because the spirit _who_ is the original spiritual lord of knowledge is Vohûman. 6. This, too, that just giving is taught by him whose words are through Vohûman [^5]; even for this reason, because the speaking of virtuous words becomes the teaching of knowledge in which _there_ is also just giving.

7\. This, too, that joy which is of long duration is produced [^6] for his own by him who brings forth strength through virtue, _and_ who also assists him who is unborn; even for this reason, because joy which is perpetual increases by both. 8. This, too, that by him who is an assistance of those in the proper way, the proper way is taught to mankind [^7]; <span id="p355"><sup><small>[ p. 355 ]</small></sup></span> even for this reason, because _he is_ making mankind long for _that_ way. 9. This, too, that heat is given to fire [^8] by him who _tells_ truth to the invokers; even for this reason, because the adversary—owing to the heat of the fire achieved _by_ the indicator of truth—is more particularly subdued by the strength of that just _one_.

10\. This, too, that the assistants for the renovation _of the universe_ are the decrees of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp which [^9] are through Vohûman—of Sôshâns [^10] and Kai-Khûsrôî [^11]; even for this reason, because the fragments are possessing a renewer which is their own completion [^12], and the completion—which is through the assistance of the renovation by Vi<i>s</i>tâsp—is through what _occurs_ when the religion is set going by him, through which the renovation arises; and the triumph of the completion, which is through an ordinance by Sôshâns, is through what _occurs_ when through the ordinance _there_ is thus a decree which sets aside all distress from the creatures, _and_ gives the ordinance _to_ the whole material existence, that which is living and also that which is dead. 11. This, too, that whoever intrusts it with a command given—which command given intrusts him who supplies the command from revelation—and it worships what is <span id="p356"><sup><small>[ p. 356 ]</small></sup></span> necessary to worship, is thereby displayed among the existences _as_ the progeny of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^13].

12\. This, too, that the defeat of the bad and the acceptance of the good [^14] are taught by him who shall provide a righteous gift for the worthy; because both are therein. 13. This, too, that ability for even the transformation of the creatures [^15] of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is taught by him who loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because the forward-dragging, and also the backward-dragging, power—which is in mankind—is qualified, through changeableness of will, for even the actions of the Vohûmanic nature. 14. This, too, that power is taught, to that spirit through whom the creatures are changed, by him whose wisdom is for that which is wisdom; even for this reason, because that spirit is wisdom, _and_ increases in mankind through instruction. 15. This, too, that by him who praises the religion like a disciple, and who also teaches _it_ like a priest [^16], it is shown _that_ Sôshâns [^16] really comes; even for this reason, because the religion, from the first praiser and teacher _down_ to the last praiser and teacher, is connected by discipleship and priesthood, _and_ Sôshâns becomes a disciple _in_ the end, and the last priest.

16\. This, too, that the wisdom of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^17] is taught by him who shall supply decisions and adjudication from the religion; even for this reason, because the decision of religion is the wisdom of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 17. This, too, that complete mindfulness, so that they are not deceived [^17], is taught <span id="p357"><sup><small>[ p. 357 ]</small></sup></span> through wisdom by him who is as reverent _to_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as a daughter _to_ a father; even for this reason, because the reverence of a daughter unto a father arises mostly through natural sympathy (âhang-î <i>k</i>itrîk), _and_ through the intellectual complete mindfulness of the daughter.

18\. This, too, that maintaining the destinies (vakhtân) of the body through the command of the creator is taught by him who teaches the righteous _man_ and the wicked _one_ that thing _which_ becomes comfort to them, _to_ the righteous _man_ as to _his_ body, _and to_ the wicked _one_ as to _his_ soul; even for this reason, because he becomes a friend of the creatures, a friend of the creatures is also a friend of creativeness, _and_ a friend of the creator maintains body _and_ wealth through the command of the creator, _and_ others are taught by him. 19. This, too, that joy owing to him who is powerful is taught him who is righteous only by him—that is, _he_ is conveying him to the rulers for benefit [^18]—who is an assistance of him who is righteous through capability, that is, he shall do it through exertion of power; even for this reason, because, when he _has_ provided as much assistance as _it_ is possible for him _to do_, his praise arises through that benefit which is pre-eminent through his exertion. 20. This, too, that the benefit _of_ sovereignty for that which arises [^19] is taught only by him who always thoroughly teaches authority (patîh) up to dictatorship (vispô-farmânîh); that is, he teaches to others that thing which always arises for them up to dictatorial. authority; this is where it is connected by them with the <span id="p358"><sup><small>[ p. 358 ]</small></sup></span> renovation _of the universe_ through the control which is in the tree of germs [^20].

21\. This, too, that he becomes liberal to fire [^21] who shall perform work for fire that is its protection, and so it is taught about _it_ through the obeisance by him whose liberality—that is his through the obeisance—becomes liberal, _and_ whose declaration, that arises as to Vohûman, possesses wealth through virtue. 22. This, too, _that_ this thinking as to righteousness [^22] is taught only by him—that is, he thinks—whose petition for righteousness is ever afresh. 23. This, too, that the religion is interrogated [^23] by him who is submissive _to_ superiors and similarly situated (ham-<i>g</i>âk) _to_ inferiors.

24\. This, too, that the state of the present _world_ (latammanîh) for the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion is thoroughly taught where whatever becomes a progress [^24] of the religion is whatever is purification for mankind; even for this reason, because the want of progress of the religion is owing to the want of purification of mankind as to the fiend, and when a human being is purified from the fiend, the progress of the religion becomes different. 25. This, too, that pleasure is taught to him who is a friend [^25]; <span id="p359"><sup><small>[ p. 359 ]</small></sup></span> only by him—that is, he gives it—who is a pleasure to him who is a friend; and its routine is really this, that by him who causes pleasure to friends, his _having_ caused pleasure is taught also to them. 26. This, too, that, owing to him whom Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> teaches joy, it is taught _that_ gratification [^26] comes from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because he is exalted, even in the worldly _existence_, through that joy which is supreme, and mankind are thereby taught.

27\. This, too, that the augmentation of indications as to intellect is taught to him who is a vigorous-minded (tûstŏ-mîni<i>s</i>nŏ) man [^27], by him whose own progress is that towards his own sacred beings; even for this reason, because he fully considers, _and_ delivers the decision, of his own powers, of those, too, of _his_ contemporaries (ham-bu<i>d</i>îkânŏ), _and_ likewise of the chivalry (<i>k</i>îrîh) of the age; and others are taught about _it_ by him. 28. This, too, that the spirit of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^28] is expounded only by him—that is, he loves _it_—whose close exposition is of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because he becomes similarly loved with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, so that [^29] . . . 29. And this, too, that the reward is taught in the publicity of the sun [^30] by him whose friendship is for the Spîtâmân, which also increases in the day—that is, it is necessary to perform duty and good works in the day—but he does not put _it_ aside the second day; even for this reason, because friendship for the religion is through kind regard; <span id="p360"><sup><small>[ p. 360 ]</small></sup></span> and duty in _one_ day, only to put _it_ aside for the second day, becomes affliction (vêsh) _at_ the bridge _of judgment_; also the sun is the most kindly-regarding and swiftest of those visible.

30\. Excellence _that_ is perfect _is_ righteousness.
