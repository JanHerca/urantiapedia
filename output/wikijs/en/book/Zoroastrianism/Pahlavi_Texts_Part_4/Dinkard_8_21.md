2\. About a person whose offending limbs _are_ bound, the degree of tightness of the binding and fettering, and the formula (nîrang) of _being_ bound for the sin of theft. 3. About imprisonment, and the imprisonment which accusers _have_ to provide, _at_ their own expense, _if_ they are those who are privileged; and whatever is on the same subject. 4. The number of places for fetters, and those which the thief, whoever _he is_, possesses, each separately. 5. How far, how, _and_ for what putting on of fetters (garov-dahi<i>s</i>nîh) those accusers _have_ to provide a thief's fetters, too, _at_ their own expense, _if_ they are those who are privileged; the place for the requisite privileged putting on of fetters, the sin owing to putting on more fetters of a different kind, and that which is owing to neglecting the putting on of the fetters which _they have_ to provide; the limit as regards the deserving of more fettering, the number of grades of theft beyond the limit of deserving fettering, and those which are below the limit of deserving fettering.

6\. About the kinds of theft, and the excessive sinfulness of a thief through cutting [^2] and wounding the body; the undiscoverableness which is specially as regards a thief at a distance (pavan hâsar), he <span id="p76"><sup><small>[ p. 76 ]</small></sup></span> who is on the spot _being_ he who is within one step; theft, with plunder, injuring the existence [^3], minor injury, and other sins, _may be_ in confederacy [^4] beforehand _or_ afterwards. 7. About the thievish design of a theft which is not abetted (lâ ham), a theft with equal shares, and a theft with different shares.

8\. About the sin of assisting a thief (dû<i>g</i> aîyyârak), _of_ making investigation and releasing, _of_ a sentence of acquittal, and _of_ a listener to a thief; he who is a giver of assistance to a thief is carried off for theft; also decisions about theft by a child, by a childless woman, _and by_ her who is pregnant; likewise their maintenance _and_ earnings (vindi<i>s</i>nŏ) in retributive work, and the work of a pregnant thief.

9\. About the accumulated property _of_ the innumerable which they would keep away from thieves, _both_ the thief by means of _his_ hands, and him who is a thief not by means of _his_ hands. 10. About the testimony _of_ a thief, that is, for what _it_ is admissible when [^5] he advances as a thief; how at the _time_ when _it is necessary_ to seize _and_ bind _him_, and how at the time when it is necessary to flatter (nivâkhtanŏ) and deceive _him_ until _one_ attains to absolute power (kâm-kârîh) thereby. 11. About rewards (na<i>v</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) with thieves. 12. About the difference of theft from plunder.

13\. About property which _any one_, carrying _it_ off, <span id="p77"><sup><small>[ p. 77 ]</small></sup></span> _has_ to bring back to _its_ owners; such as that which the frontier people _may take away_ from foreigners, that which the judge _may take away_ from thieves, and the share which he may take away from _any one_ not interfering [^6] with thieves. 14. And about protectors _and_ defenders of a thief, and also many other legal decisions as regards theft.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (74:2) Corresponding to the sixteenth word, ahurâi, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the eighteenth Nask in other Rivâyats. Ganabâ-sar-ni<i>g</i>a<i>d</i> means 'the thief's head downstricken;' but it is misread Dvâsrû<i>g</i>ad, Dvâsrûn<i>g</i>ad, Dvâsrû<i>g</i>îd, or Dvâsrôb, in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained sixty-five kardah, or subdivisions, which agree with the numbers of sections mentioned in Chaps. XXI, XXIII, XXIV. This Nask is evidently named from the contents of its first section, and possibly from its initial words.

[^2]: (75:1) Assuming that gû<i>d</i>anŏ stands for khû<i>d</i>anŏ.

[^3]: (76:1) See Chap. XIX, 1.

[^4]: (76:2) Pâz. hidhih, probably for a Pahl. adjective ha<i>d</i>ak from Av. hadha, and referring to accomplices before and after the fact (see Chap. XVIII, 5).

[^5]: (76:3) Assuming that mûn stands for amat, their Irânian equivalents being nearly alike, and the latter word being used in the succeeding clauses.

[^6]: (77:1) Av. asterethwãn. The share being a bribe for purchasing non-interference. In each case the property is to be restored to its original owner who had been robbed by the foreigners or thieves.
