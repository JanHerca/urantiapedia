## EXTANT FRAGMENTS. XVIII. SAKA<i>D</i>ÛM NASK [^1].

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 1, 2, refer to passages, one of which may possibly have contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. XII, 2:—‘It says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm that no one of them, that is an inattentive man who has no high-priest, attains to the best existence, not though his recitation should be so much that it has made his duty _and_ good works as much as the verdure of the plants when it shoots forth in spring, the verdure which is given abundantly by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 3, refers to a passage which is thus quoted in Sls. X, 25:—‘When an action or an opinion comes forward, and _one_ does not know whether _it be_ a sin or a good work, when possible _it_ is to be abandoned _and_ not carried out by him, as it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm that Zaratû<i>s</i>t _has_ not provided about anything whatever as regards everything, but three times _it has been done_ by Zaratû<i>s</i>t about this duty, that is, so that the Avesta <span id="p480"><sup><small>[ p. 480 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ Zand, when made quite easy by _any_ one, are for recitation, but are not to be mumbled, for, in mumbling, the portions _of_ the Ahunavair are more chattering.’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 6, refers to the passage thus mentioned in Sls. XII, 12:—‘Where a child is born, _during_ three days, for protection from demons, wizards, and witches, a fire is to be made at night until day_light_, and is to be maintained there by day, and pure incense is to be put upon it, as is revealed in the thirtieth [^2] of the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm.’

Dk. VIII, Chaps. XXXVIII, 13, XLI, 19, refer to passages which seem both to be partially quoted in Farh. Oîm, p. 38, ll. 4-10, thus:—‘The period is eagerly proclaimed in another place, as it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm thus:—“Thripithwô zi asti âtar<i>s</i> Ahurahê Mazd<i>a</i>u hama, bipithwô aiwi-gâmê, atha narô ashavanô:—For thrice-supplied is the fire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _in_ summer [^3], twice in winter; so is the righteous man. (Whoever has become a depriver of food (atapdâ<i>d</i>) four _times_, which are successive, should be in doubtfulness as to unrestricted (aband) maintenance vî<i>k</i>ithrem<i>k</i>i<i>d</i>: without any publicity; as much as _it is_ possible to see _being_ the original minimum of any other).”’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXV III, 33, refers to the passage which contained the statements thus quoted in Ep. I, viii, 1, 7:—‘_It is_ declared in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm, that the consecrated bull's urine, when it becomes <span id="p481"><sup><small>[ p. 481 ]</small></sup></span> fetid, is to be stirred up [^4], _and_ they should not carry _it_ forth so to the fire, so that the stench extends to the fire; because, if that stench extends to the fire, on account of the moisture _and_ through carrying bodily refuse over and forth to the fire, it overwhelms it. And that which the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm _has_ declared is, specially, that one of the high-priests _has_ individually said: “That stench is mentioned with reference to the _occasion_ when a stench reaches it of a different kind _from that_ which exists naturally in it.”’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLIII, 33, refers to the passage which contained the statements thus mentioned in Sls. XII, 10, XIII, 30:—‘In the twenty-two [^5] _sections_ of the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm grievous things are shown about those who do not make offerings unto the sacred beings.’ And, again, ‘while those nineteen (_stanzas of Yas. XLVI_) are our offering, which it says in the Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm should be my own, the strength and power of the sacred beings shall become more considerable, and the destroyer more perishable.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (479:1) The very long account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains 4,129 Pahlavi words, from which the extent of its original text may be estimated (in the same way as in the case of Nask XVII) at about 53,000 Avesta and 476,600 Pahlavi words.

[^2]: (480:1) That is, in one of the first thirty sections (see Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, i).

[^3]: (480:2) Both K20 and MH6 have amat, ‘though,’ instead of pavan hamîn. This first sentence corresponds with part of Chap. XLI, 19, and the following sentence with part of Chap. XXXVIII, 13.

[^4]: (481:1) This statement is again mentioned in § 6.

[^5]: (481:2) The _last_ twenty-two (see Dk. VIII, Chap. XLI, 1).
