## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XXXVII.

_Hûspâram Nask_.

1\. One section _of_ the seven [^1] at the end _contains_ particulars about the daily _food_ of a grown-up man, a pregnant woman, her who is childless, _and_ a child, as provided by law; _also_ that of a shepherd's dog, a village dog, and a blood-hound; and the characteristics of these three kinds of dog.

2\. About the sign of a person's conversion to the religion. 3. About association of several kinds, and one of them is that of the keepers (pa<i>d</i>ân) with the flocks (ramân), and the flocks in connection with the keepers; and of what kind is the meritoriousness of the keepers _of_ those flocks, as to guardianship of every description; the happy effects of the flock, _and_ those of the keeper, of every description; the advantage from this association, and whatever is on the same subject. 4. One is the association of priestly instructor (ra<i>d</i>ŏ) and pupil [^2], _and their_ meritoriousness together; the fame of the priestly instructor for priestly instruction, _and_ that of the disciple (hâvi<i>s</i>tô) for every kind of _learning derived_ from the priestly instructor, and every kind that the priestly instructor _imparts_ to the pupil; _and_ the happy effects of the priestly instructor, of every kind, in similar matters. 5. One is the association <span id="p115"><sup><small>[ p. 115 ]</small></sup></span> of ceremonial priests (ra<i>d</i>\-pî<i>s</i>akânŏ), the worthiness of a man for the sacerdotal leadership, supplies for the whole of the ceremonial priests, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 6. About the highest of all associations [^3], and about the lawful and virtuous existence of this same association, when _there are_ two men in _a case_ where he who is opulent is always necessary for him who is in innocence, and _has_ given _him_ the wealth that he asks for; or where, when the one shall commit sin, wealth is an affliction to the other; or the ownership, as to that which the one obtains, is as much even that of the other; or, on the passing away _of the one_, it is mingled with the wealth of the other; and whatever is on the same subject.

7\. About the punishment of the sin of him for whom _one_ lies [^4] to him by whom provision is made, by thought or by word, _and_ given to him who is worthy. 8. About a father's making a child aware of the sin at the time of the sin. 9. About the sin of taking the course of a false guide _and_ exalting falsehood, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 10. The sin of extorting supplies for a beast _of burden_ from a lonely labouring person.

11\. About important gifts to the worthy, atonement for deprival of food (atapdâ<i>d</i>ŏ-vi<i>g</i>âri<i>s</i>nîh) [^5], and disbursements (aûrûzdân) _of_ that which is legally, and also _of_ that which is derived from _what is_ legally, property among impoverished (nyûrûzd) supplicants. 12. The depriver of food is he who is _for_ early atonement, and _they_ who severally _exist_, <span id="p116"><sup><small>[ p. 116 ]</small></sup></span> through grazing [^6] _and_ bringing forth, are _they_ who severally are also in loss of vitality, through deprival of the food of strength _and_ intellect; _even_ a powerful man is prostrated thereby; the food which is suitable as atonement for deprival of food, _and_ that which is not suitable.

13\. About that through which the indispensable creation _of_ a debt arises, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 14. Where _it is_ the healing _of_ the sick, the spiritual _debt_ is unto the archangel Ashavahi<i>s</i>t [^7], _and_ that which is worldly unto the physician's anteroom (dâlânakŏ).

15\. About the worthiness _of_ a good physician for every benefit, _and_ the unworthiness _of_ a bad physician for any benefit. 16. About each one of the plants _being_ produced by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> for the subjugation of one disease at least. 17. About the protectiveness _and_ preciousness of the profession of medicine; the advantage and reasoning thought of a physician due to the carrying on of _his_ medical practice; the pleasant food, the handsome clothing, and the swift steed for a physician; and _his_ wealth _being_ as much as that of an average man in a house, village, community, _or_ province. 18. About the diligently <span id="p117"><sup><small>[ p. 117 ]</small></sup></span> remedial hand _of_ the physician for the sick, opportunely mindful, yet without chastisement.

19\. About the sin of a physician through handling (sû<i>d</i>akîh) and _having_ spread _a disease_ by walking up to the sick, because that is when _he would have been_ innocent through not _having_ gone. 20. About a great pestilence (s<i>ê</i><i>g</i>ŏ), _and_ that which is trivial.

21\. About the fee [^8] of a physician for curing a sick _person_ of disease of the whole body, _and_ of each one of the members; even of him who _has_ cured chieftains, both those of the lower grades _and_ him who is the supreme king of kings, and so also various destitute people. 22. About the mode _and_ extent of delivering up fees to a physician, after the declaration of the sick _person being_ well; that is, from whom _comes_ the physician's fee which is announced for the cure, _and_ also that which is not announced; from whom that only which is announced for it, from whom a meal (pishôn-1), and from whom nothing whatever _of_ worldly reward comes.

23\. About the physician whom _one_ hears [^9] _and_ asks for medical treatment. 24. About a test as to the competency of a physician; that is, how _it is_ to be made, how it is when it is possible to test _it, and_ how it is when it is not possible to test _it_. 25. <span id="p118"><sup><small>[ p. 118 ]</small></sup></span> About the sin of a physician who is not tested, _and_ also _of_ him whom it is not possible to test, when he shall undertake the medical treatment of others, _and_, as regards a limb of any one, there is not anything which is another's test of him, _nor_ even that which is not another's test of him, _nor_ that which is a trial of him.

26\. About how long is the duration of _having_ sought a physician in Irân whereafter _it_ is allowable, through not obtaining _one_, to seek _him_ even from foreigners. 27. The sin of _having_ sought _one_ from foreigners, when _one can_ obtain a physician in Irân. 28. About the fee for a foreign physician, and much else on the same subject. 29. The medical treatment of mankind, and also about the medical treatment of beasts _of burden and_ cattle.

30\. About the sin owing to intrusting him who is unfit for a duty. 31. About the greater suitability of a priest than _of_ a disciple for duty and position; a trusty _person_ is also obtaining the important _rather_ than obtaining a desire for the important, and even so far as _being_ a potter _rather_ than an astrologer, and being careful _rather_ than a potter; and the reason of it.

32\. About preparing an unauthorised (<i>a</i>\-dastôbar) dwelling in the locality of other persons, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 33. About boundaries where _there_ is a place of residence for people, and whatever is on the same subject. 34. About what description of testimony of _one of_ the good religion is _received_ as evidence regarding an infidel, _and_ of an infidel as regards _one of_ the good religion.

35\. About the greatness of eminence _of_ the abode of priestly authorities (ra<i>d</i>ânŏ), _both_ for procedure <span id="p119"><sup><small>[ p. 119 ]</small></sup></span> and for petitions [^10]; the openness of the doors of a priestly authority; the want of eminence of any one through every kind of offence to others, which is owing to his closed doors and evil eminence in every mode; _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 36. About the extent of splendour (lîyânŏ) and pomp-diffusing (vafsh-<i>a</i>fgânŏ) tokens from the abode of fires, _and_ the arrangement as regards him who casts the allotted twigs _and_ charcoal (khâr akhgar) into _them_. 37. About conveying prosperity (pa<i>d</i>îkhûîh) [^11] to the abode of fires appropriately _to_ the capability of every one.

38\. About the quality (sâmân) of water oozing out (aîrî<i>d</i>ŏ) and that which is flowing in a channel (nâêv-tâk). 39. About the characteristics of specified works which are contiguous in a place between two frontiers (mar’<i>z</i>ŏ).

40\. About a decision as to a sheep _free_ from unlawful influence—and so also _as to one under_ unlawful influence—which goes to the pasture of others with thievish intention, neglecting its own; and as to that which _does so_ not with thievish intention. 41. About the quantity which _one has_ to provide, in the duration of a day and night, on admitting to pasture _and_ corn, in the case of an ox without defect (anâgânŏ), or _of_ another kind, or a horse, or a sheep, or a goat, or a pig, or an animal of any other kind.

42\. About the distance of a residence of mankind from a river flowing in a channel. 43. About the period for letting a sheep graze at pleasure in a pasture, _and_ that for restraining _it;_ the time for not <span id="p120"><sup><small>[ p. 120 ]</small></sup></span> cutting trees, _and_ that for little slaughter of sheep. 44. About an article of clothing which is associated with defence, for fear of enemies, _and_ becomes quite a good omen (sukûn) _among_ mankind, _being_ imperceptible _and_ appropriate. 45. About a tree with stem uprooted, where _and_ how _it is_ allowable.

46\. About a leader's causing a march of whatever kind, the people _being_ in motion through fear, and they drive the sheep which are with the army on account of molestation; _also_ making the sheep decide as to the pasture near to the road within reach, the pasturing _of_ the first of the species of sheep, _and_ letting _them_ forth to pasture in succession unto the last, and the reason of it.

47\. About a person who is of note [^12] on account of wealth, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 48. About this intermixture _of_ with-the-stream _and_ against-the-stream, with banks and without banks, and waters running _and_ down-pouring (nîy<i>â</i>pân), on the road; that is, which of the waters, running _or_ down-pouring, is to be earlier reverenced _by him_ who is returning from the road, and the reason of it. 49. About the subordination of the disciple unto the priest, as to eating, drinking, and plenty, goodness and preciousness; _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

50\. About that which _occurs_ when foreigners come to the frontier of Irân, _and_ shall do damage to Irân; _and_ the frontier governors _and_ fellow-champions _have_ to repel the foreigners by fighting, to save the Irânian people and property which _were_ <span id="p121"><sup><small>[ p. 121 ]</small></sup></span> to be made foreign; _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

51\. About the advantage of punishing a violent thief by the members of the assembly, that owing to reliance upon the actions _and_ convictions of the ancients, that owing to forming many priestly assemblies, that owing to providing a disciple for a priest, that through passing away after _being_ high-priest, that through _doing so_ without _being_ high-priest, _and_ that of much information on similar statements prior to any other resources.

52\. Perfect is the excellence _of_ righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (114:1) It is doubtful whether seven sections are meant, or whether we should read ‘the seven Fargar<i>d</i>s at the end of one section.’ See, however, Chap. XXXVI, 1 n.

[^2]: (114:2) Pahl. ra<i>d</i>ûnê (Av. ratunaya).

[^3]: (115:1) That of disinterested and devoted friendship, as appears from the examples given.

[^4]: (115:2) By falsely recommending him as a worthy object of charity.

[^5]: (115:3) See Chap. XVII, 6 n.

[^6]: (116:1) Reading <i>k</i>ari<i>s</i>nŏ, but part of the first letter has been cut off by the repairer of the MS. The semi-starvation of cattle is being referred to.

[^7]: (116:2) The personification of ‘perfect righteousness’ (Av. ashavahi<i>s</i>ta) whose special duty is stated to be the care of fire (see Sls. XV, 5, 12, 13), and whose name, often written A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t or Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t in Pahlavi, is applied to the second month and third day of the month in the Parsi year (see Chap. XX, 22). He is here connected with the healing of the sick, because of his association with Airyaman, the smiter of diseases (see Vend. XXII, Yt. III, Sîr. I, II, 3).

[^8]: (117:1) In Vend. VII, 36-44 (W.) we have some of the old Avesta laws regarding medical men and their fees. How far the Avesta text of this section of the Hûspâram Nask corresponded with that of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> on the same subject it is impossible to determine, because we have always to recollect that this summary of the contents of the Nasks was compiled from their Pahlavi versions (see Chap. I, 3) which included extensive commentaries, adapting the original Avesta statements to the altered circumstances of Sasanian times.

[^9]: (117:2) Or ‘satisfies’ (shnâyê<i>d</i>ŏ).

[^10]: (119:1) These six words should, perhaps, be appended to the next clause of the sentence.

[^11]: (119:2) By providing fuel and other necessaries.

[^12]: (120:1) Reading mûn sakhûnag. Another guess would be min nî<i>s</i>ôn-î (for nî<i>s</i>ân-î), in which case the translation would be ‘a person _free_ from indications relating to wealth.’
