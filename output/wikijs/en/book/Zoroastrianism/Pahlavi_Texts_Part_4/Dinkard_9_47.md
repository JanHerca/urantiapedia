## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XLVII.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. Propitiation _for_ the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and all angels.

2\. The first of the twenty-two fargar<i>d</i>s of the Bakŏ [^1] is the Ahunavair [^2] of the Bakân [^3], about the production _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, before every creation apart from the archangel [^4], _and_ on the solicitation of <span id="p304"><sup><small>[ p. 304 ]</small></sup></span> the archangel, of the form _of_ words (rastakŏ mi<i>l</i>ayâ) which is the innermost and most comprehensive encompassment (parvand) _and_ best-congregated embodiment (vêh-ramaktûm kerpŏ) of the intelligent omniscience of the religion [^1].

3\. The divisions of _this_ germ of germs, _and_ the origin of the other primitive sayings of the good religion, are the divisibility of the portions (bakŏ) _of_ the Ahunavair. 4. The Ahû of the Ahû-vairyô of the Ahunavair is the first creature [^2] which, as regards the first, is specially that creature which is really _derived_ from the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and its adaptation is owing to mankind. 5. The thought (mit) [^3] that exists with the first is with the word that is Vairyô, his ‘will,’ which is in the second created existence (dâmîh), which, as regards the first, is specially the primitive secondary state (da<i>d</i>îgarîh) of those who are specially characterised by it, who exist as _it were_ with _that_ character, _and_ have become, _in_ that way, in association _with_ the second creature. 6. The conjunction of the first creature—whose origin (yehevûni<i>s</i>nŏ), which is the liturgy, is a co-existence whose origin _had_ occurred—is the source for the saying; and the distribution of the portions thereof is the whole saying of a liturgical kind; also its name is Yathâ-ahû-vairyô, the spirit through which it is set going is the lore _of_ the religion, needful among the creatures, the creations _arose_ through wisdom for that purpose, and they, too, _were_ produced on the solicitation of <span id="p305"><sup><small>[ p. 305 ]</small></sup></span> the archangel [^1]; besides this, that archangels _are_ wise in speaking, and through wisdom are they archangels.

7\. And this, too, about the same words, that the statement is the best-worded which is spoken, _or_ to be spoken [^2]; and the obscurity is not about the sound of the word-elements, but about the manifold nature of the actual meaning (kabedîh-i sang-î<i>k</i>ŏ), which is the character of the statement, in the words of the epitome. 8. This, too, that mankind guard the soul from hell by learning, reciting, and practising _it_, and the body from death [^3] by likewise perpetually persevering therein.

9\. This, too, that, _as to_ the first apportionment of the Ahunavair, whose name is the Bakân Ahunavair, when, thoroughly accomplishing _it_ (avavi<i>d</i>âr) unanxiously (asû<i>d</i>akîhâ), _one_ chants _it_ in a ceremonial, the good work is as when _one_ chants a hundred authorities (ra<i>d</i>îh) of the Gâthas, thoroughly accomplishing _them_ unanxiously [^4]; and when, accomplishing _it_ (vi<i>d</i>âr) anxiously, _one_ chants _it_, such a ceremonial amounts to _as much_ as ten _with any other authority_ [^5]. 10. This, too, that, through the same apportionment, while _one_ solemnizes the summing up of the first completion [^6], which is the Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t, as it becomes the rite of _one_ newly initiated (navak-n<i>â</i>par) [^7], on that day <span id="p306"><sup><small>[ p. 306 ]</small></sup></span> they make the soul of the solemnizer pass three times into the supreme heaven [^1].

11\. About the grievous sinfulness of imperfectly accomplishing (avi<i>d</i>âr) the Bakân Ahunavair [^2].

12\. This, too, that it is made by him in subjection _to_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as the first creature made, who gives the body in service to him who is the ruler, _and_ in discipleship to him who is the high-priest of the religion [^3]; for this reason, because they are suitable _for_ lordship and mastership in the worldly _existence_. 13. He who is the highest lord _and_ master is the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and, owing to the same reason, when it made their subjection that _to_ the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, he has made _it_ as the first creature made.

14\. This, too, that it is taught by it to keep the body in the service of the king of kings [^4], whose origin Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> keeps in _his_ possession; for this reason, because, when _his_ origin is kept in the possession _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is over his own if a good ruler is made; him who is thus prepared, when also the worldly existence is necessary _for_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, he maintains as ruler when the creation is instructed.

15\. This, too, that the reward of Vohûman is appropriated (khvêsinî<i>d</i>ŏ) by him who indicates anything which is virtuous, who also utters virtuous recitation, _and_ who likewise teaches perfect abstinence from sin to mankind [^5]. 16. For this reason, because the indication of anything virtuous, the utterance of recitation wisely, _and_ abstinence from <span id="p307"><sup><small>[ p. 307 ]</small></sup></span> sin are, as _it were_, a lodgment materially in good people owing spiritually to the archangels, Vohûman _being_ more particularly the instigator therein; and, owing to the same reason, _he_ in whom there is a like proficiency is of like good works with Vohûman, and adapted to the good works arises the like reward.

17\. This, too, that the dominion is given to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by him who may perform those _works_, is manifest from _the phrase_ Ta<i>d</i> mazdâ tavâ khshathrem, &c. and its meaning, which is this: ‘That, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! is this dominion of thine, _by_ which benefits (vehagânŏ) are given _to_ him who is justly living _and_ poor [^1].’ 18. Which is a deliverance for this reason, because Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> created no dominion for the more particular preservation of the poor _and_ the creatures of the worldly _existence_ from the destroyer; _but_, for the purpose of control over the dominion of _him_ whose strength of rule is the cause of preservation for the poor—which is continually the wish of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>—the dominion is given to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

19\. _And_ this, too, that, through preservation from the adversary, he has assisted his poor who have preserved friendship for the Spîtâmân [^2]; the adversity _of_ the creatures is the advancement of religion, by supporting the religion; and a friend of the Spîtâmân becomes an assistant of the supporters of religion. 20. About the entrance (dên yâtûn<i>d</i>akîh) of the destroyer of the creatures from without [^3], _and_ the helplessness of the beneficent spirit owing thereto. <span id="p308"><sup><small>[ p. 308 ]</small></sup></span> 21\. About the girding on of this saying of the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by the three degrees (pa<i>d</i>mân), which are good thoughts, good words, _and_ good deeds; _by_ the four classes, which are priesthood, warriorship, husbandry, and artisanship; and _by_ the five chieftainships, which are house-rule, village-rule, tribe-rule, province-rule, and the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>tship; and the one summing up (hanger<i>d</i>îkîh) which is the liberality of the good ruler [^1].

22\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (303:1) The third of the Nasks and fourth of the Gâthic division (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 9, 12). It is an analytical commentary upon the Gâthas and the texts associated with them in the two preceding Nasks, devoting a separate fargar<i>d</i> to each hâ, and selecting very short phrases, or portions (Av. bagha), for explanation and comment; so short that it is usually difficult to identify them in their Pahlavi disguise. The first three fargar<i>d</i>s are still extant in Yas. XIX-XXI, and a translation of their Pahlavi versions will be found in the Nask Fragments at the end of this volume; but whether the Pahlavi versions, consulted by the writer of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, were identical with those in the present Yasna is uncertain.

[^2]: (303:2) The name of the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô formula (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7). This fargar<i>d</i> is still extant in Yas. XIX.

[^3]: (303:3) That is, ‘of the apportionments,’ or ‘of those analyzed.’

[^4]: (303:4) Possibly the archangel Vohûman, the first of the creatures, may be meant; although the Bundahi<i>s</i> places his creation after the recitation of the Ahunavair (see Bd. I, 21-23). That it was p. 304 recited before the other creations is clearly stated in Pahl. Yas. XIX, 2-5, 17-20.

[^1]: (304:1) See Pahl. Yas. XIX, 24-27.

[^2]: (304:2) Ibid. 29.

[^3]: (304:3) Ibid. Pâz. mit = Av. maiti = manas.

[^1]: (305:1) See Pahl. Yas. XIX, 20.

[^2]: (305:2) Ibid. 24.

[^3]: (305:3) Ibid. 25, 26.

[^4]: (305:4) Ibid. 6, 7. The MS. has ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) instead of ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) ‘100,’ by mistake.

[^5]: (305:5) Ibid. 8. The MS. has ‘unanxiously’ by mistake.

[^6]: (305:6) Possibly Yas. LIX, 32-34.

[^7]: (305:7) Commonly called Nônâbar (see Sls. X, 2, XIII, 2; Dd. LXXIX, 4, 11, 12).

[^1]: (306:1) See Pahl. Yas. XIX, 9-11.

[^2]: (306:2) Ibid. 32-15.

[^3]: (306:3) Ibid. 28, 29.

[^4]: (306:4) Ibid. 30.

[^5]: (306:5) Ibid. 31, 32.

[^1]: (307:1) See Pahl. Yas. XIX, 35, Yas. LIII, 9 d, and Chap. XLV, 10.

[^2]: (307:2) Ibid. 36.

[^3]: (307:3) Ibid. 39.

[^1]: (308:1) See Pahl. Yas. XIX, 44-55.
