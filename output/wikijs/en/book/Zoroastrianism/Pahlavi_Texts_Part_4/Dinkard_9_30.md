## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXX.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The seventh fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>\-tâ-vakhshyâ [^2], is regarding the maintenance of the worship and obeisance of the religion and the spirit of the liturgy; and this, too, that the spirit of the ceremonial of him who is a right-thinking, intelligent, and wise [^3] man is quickly mixed up with the light of the sun, and connected with the accomplishment of the wishes and the joy of the archangels.

2\. About the choice of will _by_ mankind, and the existence of a way to reward through _their_ decision. 3. About advice to mankind as to seeking that position in which it is possible to remain long with fondness, and _as to_ reciting and teaching [^4] the revelation of the sacred beings.

4\. And, from the statement of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, about the shouting of the demon Aresh [^5] to mankind, _thus:_ <span id="p242"><sup><small>[ p. 242 ]</small></sup></span> ‘Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Aharman have been two brothers in one womb [^1], and out of them the archangel [^2] liked that which is evil [^3], through what _occurs_ when the understanders of it _have_ mentioned the worship of the demons and this, that, after it, you _should_ present cattle to the planetary _bodies and_ the demons.’ 5. About the falsity of the demon Aresh, the separate origin of light and darkness, the goodness of the material _existence_ of light for determining _what_ is done, and the evil of that of darkness.

6\. The grumbling of the evil spirit thus: ‘I am he whose thoughts _are_ evil, O beneficent spirit! he whose words _are_ evil, _and_ he whose deeds _are_ evil [^4]; what is dark is my garment which is very thick, with lower corners where, so far as many go, _it is still_ darker [^5]; evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds are my food, and I love those _of_ them who are in _that place_ through evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.’ 7. And the speaking of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘I am he whose thoughts _are_ good, O evil spirit! he whose words _are_ good, and he whose deeds _are_ good [^6]; the sky is my garment, which _was_ first produced from that substance of the worldly _existences_ which is created as the stone above all stones [^7], that is, every jewel is set in it; good thoughts, good words, and good deeds are my food, and I love those _of_ them who are in that _place_ <span id="p243"><sup><small>[ p. 243 ]</small></sup></span> through good thoughts, good words, _and_ good deeds.’

8\. This, too, that true discrimination is not for them, the demons [^1] astute in evil; and they never truly discriminate whose will is that of Akôman [^2]. 9. And about the sickening (vîmârînî<i>d</i>anŏ) of the patron spirits of mankind, _by_ the demons [^3], through the deceit of man towards man owing to the deceit of the demons; and the approach of mankind to evil proceedings _on the part_ of the spiritual lordship, through those patron spirits [^4].

10\. Also the sending of monarchy and the wisdom of religion, _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, for the preservation of the creatures; the recurrence of the mission [^5] whereby _there are_ injury and affliction for the demons and sovereignty again for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and they possess the reward of Vohûman [^6] and _what_ is required _by_ the sacred beings; and the predominance _of_ man over demon, in the end, the good over the evil, and the righteous over the wicked; also about the nature of those _who_ are producing the renovation _of the universe_. 11. This, too, that is a declaration: ‘They are those, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! who shall produce the renovation, they have escaped (girekhtŏ) among the existences, they are <span id="p244"><sup><small>[ p. 244 ]</small></sup></span> vigilant [^1] in seeking righteousness, and gentle-voiced; and, as regards righteousness in thought, they convert into righteousness anything virtuous which _belongs_ to them.’ 12. About the statement of _those_ praised it is recited that it is thus mentioned in the Gâthas: ‘So we are with _those_ who are thine—that is, we are thine own—by us this renovation is to be produced in the existences [^2].’ 13. About the perpetual convocation _held by_ the archangel regarding . the production of the future existence [^3].

14\. This, too, that _he_ is an extender of the days of those who defeat the army of the fiend [^4] and clothe themselves _with_ deeds of shining light, and also those of a virtuous body, who are these: the priest, the warrior, the husbandman, and the man who is a ruler; with whom are Aharî<i>s</i>vang [^5] and the spirit of liberality (râ<i>d</i>îh) [^6]; they meditate with good thoughts (hû-mîni<i>s</i>nîh) [^7] and joy, and, with pleasure to themselves, they give the world into the guardianship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and also _of_ Ashavahi<i>s</i>t [^8], when they possess the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as a ruler. 15. This, too, that _he_, whose thoughts are through a high-priest who possesses a patron spirit, always thinks that which is virtuous, and his sagacity increases [^9].

16\. And about advice to mankind as to three things, through which the renovation and happy progress of the creatures arise, _namely_, seeking the <span id="p245"><sup><small>[ p. 245 ]</small></sup></span> true religion, abstaining from injuring the creatures, _and_ striving for the benefit of mankind.

17\. The excellence _of_ righteousness is perfect.
