## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXIX.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The sixth fargar<i>d</i>, Khshmaibyâ [^1], is about the complaint of Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan [^2] to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, when she sat at the creation in the assembly of the archangels, as regards the abundant disease and misery which she saw spiritually _would_ come upon her in a bodily existence, through beating, slaughtering, _and_ wounding, stealing, plundering, and presenting, _by_ him of vicious actions _and_ worse desires, as a bribe to him who is an evil-ruling villain (mar), and the operation thereof: the bad ownership, wrongful investigation, false evidence, and making captive (var<i>d</i>akŏ), _by_ him who is wrathful _and_ oppressive through greed and envy, from the warm cowshed _and_ the effective _and_ diligent guardianship of the herd's dog (pasû<i>s</i>\-haûrvô), to that which is a cold _and_ hastily-constructed place; _or by_ him who is seeking meat _with_ a merciless hand through making _her_ distantly separated from her young. 2. Also their explanation and extenuation (kâstanŏ) [^3], and the causing of misery of many kinds thereby, ‘which is no affliction to them when the wind that is cold [^4], _or_ even that which is hot, comes upon me; _which_ is no affliction to them when, the _untimely offspring of_ <span id="p238"><sup><small>[ p. 238 ]</small></sup></span> _my_ womb _being_ cast away, they slaughter me; and is no affliction to them when the serpent, the leech (khun-garâî) [^5], _or_ even the foulest of noxious creatures gnaws me.’ 3. And the petition of Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan _was_ thus: ‘Do not appoint me to a worldly _existence_ and that awful misery, _or_, if thou appointest me to a worldly _existence_, produce it for me without life (aûzû<i>s</i>tânîhâ), so that I _may_ be without feeling and may want that distressing [^6] pain; _it is_ created for the mighty, through whose assistance there is a capability of affording protection _to_ me, even though the Kaî and Karap [^7] exist.’

4\. And, _together_ with the just complaint of Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan, and the compassion of the archangels as to that complaint, _there is_ then the creation of the creatures, among whom the greatest and best [^8] is mankind, for fighting _and_ subduing the destroyer, even though joined together with a complaint of wounding and affliction like _that of_ Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan, _and_ Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan arose with greater judiciousness than an absence of creation even with freedom from disturbance by the Kaîs [^9]; on account of the necessity of preparing _for_ the living of mankind through the assistance of cattle, Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan _was_ produced for the material bodily existence and assistance of mankind. 5. And, on account of little feeling for her worldly misery, the breeding (mâyînî<i>d</i>anŏ) of cattle _was_ the arraying <span id="p239"><sup><small>[ p. 239 ]</small></sup></span> of strife; the advancement of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in the world by Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan, on the production of Zaratû<i>s</i>t for the assistance of cattle; _and_ the preservation of cattle and other good creations through complete satisfaction _at_ the progress _of_ the religion.

6\. This, too, _was_ said to Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan, that is: ‘I assert unto thee the passing away of devastation, that is, the existence of a remedy _for_ the misery owing to the evil spirit [^10], _for_ which no creature would be produced by me—me who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>—when a remedy _for_ the misery owing to him had not been known to me.’ 7. This, too, that the wish of the evil spirit was thus: ‘Thou shouldst never produce a creature, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! and _there_ should be here no spiritual lordship, no priestly authority, and no desire for perfect righteousness, _or_ necessity for duty and good works.’ 8. The enquiry of Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan, thus: ‘For whom am I appointed and formed? [^11]’ and the reply to her, thus: ‘For him who is diligent _and_ moderate [^12].’

9\. Also the friend and nourishment (srâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) begged for cattle _by_ Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan, the righteous man produced for the assistance of cattle _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the sweetness in water and plants for the nourishment of cattle, so that he is privileged to feed _and_ keep cattle who gives them pasture _in_ reality, and is also diligent _in_ the production of cattle, that is, he gives them pasture, and is thereby proclaimed a cattle-guardian (pasû<i>s</i>\-haûrvô) for them who makes the cattle fully develope [^13]; and also <span id="p240"><sup><small>[ p. 240 ]</small></sup></span> he who gives the wicked Wrath, the foreigner, a beating, so that he may make _him_ stupefied [^14]. 10. The development of cattle _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, advice to mankind as to moderate eating [^15], and the grievous bridge _judgment_ of him who _has_ unlawfully produced distress _for_ the cattle whom Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan is kindly regarding, with loving eyes [^16], in the spiritual _existence_, in bodily contact with (ham-kerpŏ-î) the archangels and in bodily contact with the light of the sun, so that _her_ hands are more powerful; she who replies to the sacred beings, and the sacred beings reply to her [^17].

11\. About the statements of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _there is_ this, too, that is: ‘I am a calculator of those words [^18] by which they assert _that_ the existence of worldly beings is for the sake of that of both existences; I am aware _of_ the actions which are practised by those in the material existence, _both_ demons and men; of whatever they practise [^19] I am the decider _and_ lord, and it is such as my will _requires_ [^20], even for the last change of existence; and I look upon all that with that wisdom and sagacity of mine which was, which is, and which ever _will_ be.’

12\. The formation of a reward for worldly beings _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, through the propitious liturgy (mânsars<i>p</i>end) [^21] which has become the precursor of the benefiters; that is, their high-priest, who has <span id="p241"><sup><small>[ p. 241 ]</small></sup></span> a propitiousness and intelligence that are all-beneficial, is he _with_ the liturgy. 13. And about the uniqueness and incomparableness of Zaratû<i>s</i>t among mankind, through _his_ desire for righteousness and _his_ understanding the means of defeating the destroyer [^22] and teaching the creatures.

14\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.
