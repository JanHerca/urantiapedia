## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XXVIII.

1\. One section of the _first_ thirty of the Hûspâram [^1] is the Aêrpatistân [^2] (‘_priest-code_’), particulars about _a case_ where _one has_ to provide for a priestly assembly (aêrpatistân), which is a birth; how the _case_ is when _it_ is important to go, how it is when _one_ <span id="p93"><sup><small>[ p. 93 ]</small></sup></span> stays at his own _house_, and how it is when _it_ is not allowable to go; also deciding about the _chief_ priest (aêrpatŏ), and the proportion of priests (âsrûkŏ) who are superior, _of_ those who are intermediate, and _of_ those who are inferior in the estimation of the wisdom of the righteous. 2. About the priest whom _one_ is sending, and the wayfaring garments _and_ appliances which are to be given to him.

3\. About the disciple, as reverent towards the _chief_ priest; the labour in receiving the _sacred_ words _and_ teaching _them_ to the disciple; the advice of the _chief_ priest to the priests; _and_ the muttered phrases at the time of contamination _by dead matter_. 4. About what priest—on the arrival of a priest back at the district from which _one_ sends _him_—is to be appointed, as priest for the district from which _he came, by_ the district governor and those of the district, for teaching _and_ instruction in the district.

5\. About which are _those_ reckoned as the five dispositions [^1] of a priest that are the glorification of the priest's statements of the law, _from_ the first of _his_ statements in succession unto the last, _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

6\. About the subjects regarding which a priest of concealed parentage is to be asked, _with_ the prelude and sequel of the same subject. 7. About the bridge _penalty_ [^2] of a priest through sinfulness, _in_ a separate fargar<i>d</i> [^3]. 8. About a priest they may carry away from a district, owing to anxiety for forming a priestly assembly, _who_ becomes worried in forming _it_. <span id="p94"><sup><small>[ p. 94 ]</small></sup></span> 9\. About the superiority of priests in means of knowledge, one as regards another; the extent of superiority through which the greater suitability for authority, of one as regards another [^1], arises; _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (92:1) Corresponding to the seventeenth word, â, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; and it is the seventeenth Nask in all Rivâyats. This name should probably be Avisp-kharam, meaning ‘free from all defect;’ but it is called Hûspârâm, Aspâram, or Aspâram in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained sixty-four, or sixty, kardah or subdivisions. The former number agrees with the total of the sections mentioned in Chaps. XXVIII, XXXII, XXXVI.

[^2]: (92:2) A considerable portion of this section is still extant, combined with a larger portion of the next section, the Nîrangistân, whose name is applied to the whole text.

[^1]: (93:1) See Bd. XIX, 36 n.

[^2]: (93:2) See Chap. XX, 63.

[^3]: (93:3) See Chap. I, 20.

[^1]: (94:1) Reading s<i>a</i><i>g</i>âktarîh-î aêvakŏ min tanê pavan patîh, but there are only faint traces of the third, fourth, and fifth words, as the decayed folio of the manuscript has been patched, and the repairer forgot to record the missing words at the time he did his work. His marginal note refers to a defect in the next line of the manuscript.
