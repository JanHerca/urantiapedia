## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XL.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The seventeenth fargar<i>d</i>, Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû [^5], is about _this_, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> produced the creatures through wisdom, _and_ maintains _them_ in truth. 2. This, too, that the best thing [^6] _for_ every one is thought in a high-priest who is the tongue of a spiritual lord [^7]; in a high-priest, who _has_ to maintain thought, no appliances of the body _are_ to lie unto the spiritual lord on account of affection _for_ the <span id="p283"><sup><small>[ p. 283 ]</small></sup></span> worldly _existence_. 3. Also that the spiritual lord is always true; of the tongue—when he (_the priest_) speaks falsehood with the tongue—are those words which he does not believe through the spiritual lord, and _it is_ owing to this, too, when, of all the body, the tongue first dies. 4. ‘I say unto thee, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! that thou shouldst speak with the tongue just as thou thinkest with the mind, and thou shouldst accomplish work with both hands in complete mindfulness [^1].’ 5. And this, too, that he who shall act thus is sagacious, and he is the father of righteousness through wisdom [^2]; and whoever would do that which has happened, thoroughly observes _it_ on account of that _which_ has not happened. 6. Also this, _that_ in the person of him who shall do that which he understands, _and_ asks again about that which he does not understand, the propitious spirit of wisdom is lodging.

7\. About cattle _being_ produced for the assistance _of_ mankind, and the pastures of pleasure for the assistance _of_ cattle [^3]. 8. This, too, that the archangels injure the evil demon and wicked people, _but_ they do not injure righteous people [^4] and the sage. 9. This, too, _is said_, namely: ‘In scanty opulence do not murmur (a<i>l</i> mang) owing to good works [^5], _and_ thus in great opulence much good work arises.’ 10. This, too, that beneficence gives all to the good, _and_ it is no further the villain whom the sacred beings maintain [^6].

11\. About the tongue _of_ a true speaker _being_ given for the satisfying (vi<i>g</i>âri<i>s</i>nŏ) of disputants, <span id="p284"><sup><small>[ p. 284 ]</small></sup></span> _and for_ declaring who is acquitted _or_ incriminated; and the ordeal that is a demonstrator, to acquit _or_ convict, which he whose tongue is truthful _has_ accepted—and it shall make his statement current—has developed its jurisdiction in the world, _and_ diminished distress. 12. _And_ this, too, _is said_, that he gives out fire for disputes, so that it may make manifest the acquitted and incriminated, when he in whom are his immense complete mindfulness, and also righteousness, is guardian of the ordeal; and, when many inspect it, that which is the ritual of the ordeal believes them wicked [^1].

13\. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.
