## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XLIII.

_Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm Nask_.

1\. One section is miscellaneous: about _having_ sought an assistant who is brought, that is, in what mode _it_ is proper; _and_ the payment of an assistant who is a member of the community (dâhm) [^1], and also that of a foreigner (an-Aîr), in the same affair. 2. About how the coming of a man to confinement and fettering is through his own wealth, and whatever is on the same subject. 3. About confession through one, two, and three statements; _and_ whatever is about it. 4. About the contempt _of_ a disciple for a _priestly_ master, which is an annoyance to him; the property _belonging_ to the master, and the squandering that occurs in _it_. <span id="p146"><sup><small>[ p. 146 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. The sin that is its own penalty through _being_ liable to penalty, _and_ the transgressor whose penalty is owing thereto; when they would unlawfully bring a penalty upon _one_ liable to penalty, or _one_ thereby inflicts a penalty _upon_ him, of which _one_ is aware that _he_ is not capable (patûkŏ); and the time which _one_ liable to penalty _has_ for the payment of that penalty of _his_ is until his attaining to opulence, when, after the appointment about the penalty, he becomes capable of an atonement. 6. About the accumulation (gan<i>g</i>îh) of sin through the expedients of the wrathful (garmakân), which are connected with much destruction of the righteous. 7. About the sin owing to which, among those that are wrathful, _he_ who _has_ drunk from a well on a road, _or_ path, conceals the water for the sake of concealment.

8\. About the sin of a judge who pronounces the sinner _to be_ in innocence, and the innocent _to be_ in some sinfulness. 9. About a judge acquainted with the law [^2] _for_ ten years, him who is _for_ eleven, him who is _for_ twelve, him who is _for_ thirteen, him who is for _fourteen_, _and_ him who is _for_ fifteen; that is, their decisions, each separately, on several specially prominent objects of acquaintance with the law, as regards decision and judgment.

10\. About a daughter whose religious control, during the life of her father, _resides_ in _her_ mother for the joint life of the mother, but for [^3] the authorised giving _her away there_ is the father. 11. About a daughter who is unprovided with a husband, _and_ <span id="p147"><sup><small>[ p. 147 ]</small></sup></span> who _has_ no father and no mother, nor yet any of the brothers of the departed parents, _and it_ is not even allowable to give herself away into guardianship by a husband.

12\. About property which is _bequeathed_ by will _on_ passing away; that is, how it is when given, _and_ how it is when it does not exist. 13. About the privilege of a father in giving property to _his_ children according to his wish, and a son who is irreverent towards _his_ father, so that [^4] _some_ of the property of the father _goes_ to the worthy mother; also when they would make irreverence towards the father the imputed characteristic (bâkht nî<i>s</i>ânŏ), where a decree about the property of the father is decided upon; _and_ whatever is on the same subject, as regards the extent of irreverence _of_ the son towards the father, and the sin of it.

14\. About the sin of a son [^5] who is accepted, when he recoils from that acceptance; the accepter of a living, _or_ even a departed, father is _so_ because _it is_ the will _of_ the people, and also _for_ the worldly fame of a soul of the departed; and the ceremonial _and_ obeisance are, moreover, for those of them within their own dwelling, owing to letting forth their generosity, and they shall provide them.

15\. About the production _and_ arising of even that property which a liberal person _has_ not seen, _if_ there be any one who [^6] _has_ not lived liberally. <span id="p148"><sup><small>[ p. 148 ]</small></sup></span> 16. About the production _and_ arising of something of the property of a damsel, even when she gives _it_ by design only to him _who_ is worthy.

17\. About a damsel whom an idolator (dêvîyast) carries off from her own master, _and_ would give. to a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper; that is, how _it is_ justifiable for the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper, _having_ had that damsel in _his_ possession, to seek a son by _her_, so long as the guardianship of the woman is with that man. 18. About a mother _being_ guardian over a living father, owing to _their having_ a son. 19. About the proper completion of a provision—that was for the decision _of_ the supreme judge, _on_ various statements, and was never otherwise—which is the provision _of him_ who is a high-priest of the religion.

20\. About the sin of a father through not satisfying the menstrual excitement of a daughter who _has_ attained the capability of _having_ a son (be<i>r</i>man ra<i>d</i>îh); what it is when, through not satisfying the menstrual excitement of the daughter, _he is_ sinful; and how it is when the daughter herself is sinful; also the symptoms of attaining the capability of _having_ a son.

21\. About where _and_ which is that sin on the committal of which inadvertently _one_ attains to deliverance thus, when it comes to his knowledge _it is_ through a determined renunciation it goes away from _its_ source; _also_ which is that committal inadvertently which does not occur through him who is intelligent. 22. About the four more heinous _forms of_ demon-service (<i>s</i>êdâ-y<i>a</i><i>z</i>akîh), and the three worst sins wherein they shall perform _them;_ the ten existences that are furtherances, and the nine that are destroyers, _of_ the world. <span id="p149"><sup><small>[ p. 149 ]</small></sup></span> 23\. About a true _statement_ through which, when _one_ utters _it, he_ is wicked _and_ worthy of death. 24. About driving the bestowable benefit of the spiritual _existence_ away from the world, when he who is destroying a righteous _man_ walks openly in the world; how one section _of_ the spirit's earth is that of a people [^7] destroying the righteous _man_, and the complaint of the spirits of fire, water, and plants, owing thereto; _also_ how the bestowal of the allotment of a leading man is upon his inferiors. 25. About the three kinds _of_ righteous men; one that is greater than water _and_ earth, animals _and_ plants, one that is equal _to them_, and one that is less; and what is the arrangement of—as _it were_—the conjoined formation of those who are somewhat outside of the three kinds.

26\. About the grievous bridge_\-judgment_ for carrying forth dead matter to water, or to fire, with which _there_ is evidence; and the heaviness of the spirit due to dead matter in the water. 27. The good work of him who brings the dead matter [^8] _of_ man _or_ dog, <span id="p150"><sup><small>[ p. 150 ]</small></sup></span> _or_ that of the serpent _or_ frog, out of the water. 28. About the destruction of the serpent and frog, and other aquatic noxious creatures, in the water when it is _only_ thus possible, _and_ carrying _them_ out from it when it is possible. 29. About the gratification of the spirit of the world, _and_ the vexation of the demons, owing to the destruction of them.

30\. Where _and_ what are the tokens of the good [^9] management and well-operating drinking-party (tô<i>s</i>tîh) of a neighbour not of the same district (ahamshat<i>r</i>ô nazd). 31. About the sin of him who, after joining a drinking-party from sunset (hû-frâshmôkdâ<i>d</i>ŏ), pulverizes the road (râh tekhnunê<i>d</i>ŏ), keeps the door opened, _and_ would unlawfully make an uproar.

32\. About Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _having_ produced the bodies _and_ members of animals—through _having_ created the body of the sole-created ox with satisfaction, as assistance for mankind—because _they_ are repeated for protection, and also _for_ the ceremonial for sacred beings specially declared. 33. About the reason of making offerings (aûstôfrî<i>d</i>ŏ) to the sacred beings, for the increase of power of the allotters of destiny in the allotment of destiny; the connection of that acknowledgement (pa<i>d</i>îri<i>s</i>nŏ) and _of_ the benefit _and_ advantage of the recompense thereof; the proper maintenance _of_ that acknowledgement, through the means _and_ efficacy _of_ the spiritual bridge_\-judgment_ of sin, and the fear of worldly disaster and harm from not properly maintaining the perpetual acknowledgement in force <span id="p151"><sup><small>[ p. 151 ]</small></sup></span> (dên patûkîh), _and from_ the setting up even of ruin thereby; the reasonable control of the offering to each one of the sacred beings therein is for the skilful member of the community (hûnarîk dâhm) of whatever kind, _and_ is not produced by intrusting the consecration to the violent, more particularly to those whom _one_ specially enumerates; the sin and retribution owing to _having_ given _it_ to those who are of that class; _and_ more upon the same subject.

34\. About the damage and injury of the world owing to greed (<i>â</i><i>z</i>ŏ) and its fellow-miscreations, _and_ him who is their supporter and abettor, the idolator (dêvîyastô), also the wolf of many kinds and noxious creatures of various species; because the occurrence of their fiendishness is due to the original fiend, _and_ the means for strengthening their fiendishness are _derived_ from the destruction of all mankind _and_ the other primary worldly creations which are aiding mankind. 35. Advice to mankind about smiting and destroying the evil domination (dû<i>s</i>khshasarînî<i>d</i>anŏ) of the world _by_ those _injurers_, and the merit manifest for them_selves_ therein; the object _and_ spiritual reward for smiting _and_ killing each one of the wolves _and_ noxious creatures, _and_, as regards the same reward, the perfection of that for destroying a two-legged wolf [^10]; _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

36\. About advice as to not reverencing the evil spirit and demons, whereby the observing (var’<i>z</i>ŏ) of the several ceremonies and gratifications of the sacred beings _would be_ more particularly irregular in _any_ manner whatever, and the damage and <span id="p152"><sup><small>[ p. 152 ]</small></sup></span> harm _owing_ to those _who are_ irregular _and_ ill-observant, through being inclined for that irregularity _and_ ill-observance, _would_ become an oppressive presidence (pa<i>d</i>gahîh) of the demons over the creatures; also the vice of clamorous talking (drâyân gôgîh) [^11] and the damage owing thereto, _and_ the pleasure of the demons due to the same _and_ other _things_ which are irregular. 37. Advice about the reason, habit, _and_ primitive practice of not chattering, and other good customs, during eating _and_ drinking; the gratification of the sacred beings owing to that primitive practice of good customs _by_ mankind, and the unself-devoting (a-khvê<i>s</i>\-dâk) is he who is not maintaining _it_.

38\. Through the ceremonial of which sacred being is the greater welcome (mâhmânŏtarîh) of a high-priest _and of_ any good work _of_ each one of the five periods of the day and night; the reward and advantage owing to celebrating the ceremony of each of them separately in its own period, and also other means _and_ regulations in the same statement.

39\. It is righteousness _that is_ perfect excellence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (145:1) The contradistinction here indicated between dâhm and an-Aîr is an important confirmation of Geldner's definition of Av. dahma as ‘Vollbürger oder Mitglieder’ (see Studien zum Avesta, 1882, p. 14).

[^2]: (146:1) See Chaps. XX, 74, XXII, 2r.

[^3]: (146:2) Reading râî instead of lâ, ‘not.’

[^4]: (147:1) As aêgh also means ‘where,’ it is rather uncertain whether the irreverence is supposed to be the cause, or the effect, of the special provision for the mother which afterwards becomes a source of litigation.

[^5]: (147:2) An adopted son must be meant.

[^6]: (147:3) Supposing that min stands for mûn.

[^7]: (149:1) Some neighbouring nation of unbelievers is probably meant, such as the Byzantines; as we must always recollect that the compiler is summarizing the contents of the Pahlavi commentary written in Sasanian times (see Chap. I, 3).

[^8]: (149:2) See Chap. XXVII, 4. It appears from this section that the dead matter of an evil creature, such as a snake or frog, was considered to pollute the water as much as that of a good creature. § 28, however, admits the expediency of killing noxious creatures in the water when it is impossible to take them out beforehand; and this is in accordance with Vend. V, 35-38 (W.) which teaches that an apostate defiles no one when dead (any more than a dried-up frog that has been dead a year), because he defiles while living. This rule was evidently intended to remove all scruples as to killing such creatures, but it applies to them only when recently killed; hence the necessity of removing them, from any place liable to p. 150 pollution, as soon as possible after death, common sense being preferable to logical consistency.

[^9]: (150:1) Supposing that vûp stands for khûp.

[^10]: (151:1) A term applied to an idolator.

[^11]: (152:1) Whereby the devotions are disturbed, or rendered ineffectual.
