## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER VII.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The sixth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>\-tâ-vakhshyâ [^1], is about the perfection of the five excellences: the first through righteousness, the second through virtuous offspring, the third through land producing vegetation, the fourth through flocks of sheep, and the fifth through training in industry. 2. About the distribution of fortune to the diligent; and _of_ destitution to the indolent. 3. About the acquirement of fortune singly sitting, two-fold even walking, three-fold hastening, four-fold even running, five-fold even carrying on a horse, six-fold even driving on a road, seven-fold by understanding legal proceedings, eight-fold by good protection even of wealth, nine-fold by intelligence _and_ diligence in the cultivation of land, and ten-fold by providing the teaching of the bounteous texts [^2].

4\. About the grievous sorrow _of_ an aged man, owing to the indolence of any one in youth. 5. About the four things through which, when a man has <span id="p180"><sup><small>[ p. 180 ]</small></sup></span> amassed _them_ in his youth, he becomes very pleased in old age: first, virtuous learning; second, productive wealth; third, a good wife; _and_ fourth, a prosperous dwelling. 6. About the five store-holders [^1] of perfect excellence: industry, diligence, contentment, guileless understanding (nîrikht-hûshîh), and provision of means.

7\. About abstaining from sitting with drunkards. 8. And this, too, that he does not drink varieties of wine (mâê-gunagânŏ) with the approval of the sacred beings, who becomes a viciously-disposed assailant and annoyer of others, and a disturber (k<i>ê</i>pînî<i>d</i>âr) of duties, through drinking varieties of wine. 9. And this, too, that thou shouldst eat that which is your food where _there is_ a suitable place. 10. And where _it is_ eaten by thee it should be lightly, it should not be heavily, so that, when _it is_ eaten by thee, a good work is performed, and _there is_ abstinence from sin. 11. And, so that what thou eatest shall be immortally joyful to thee, where _there are_ poor, provide _them_ a share, and the poor _will_ bless thee; and, _as to_ a poor _man_ who is righteous, the opinion is _that_ his blessing is best.

12\. Excellence _that_ is perfect _is_ righteousness.
