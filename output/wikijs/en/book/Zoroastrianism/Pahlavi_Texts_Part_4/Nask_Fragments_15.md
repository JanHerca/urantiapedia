## EXTANT FRAGMENTS. XV. NÎKÂ<i>D</i>ÛM NASK [^1].

Dk. VIII, Chap. XVIII, 3, refers to the passage which, no doubt, contained the statement thus quoted <span id="p472"><sup><small>[ p. 472 ]</small></sup></span> in Farh. Oîm, pp. 6, 1. 11-7, l. 13:—‘Aêdha is the skin of the head, and there is _part_ of it which is large and _part_ which is small, as it says in the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm:—“Kaya he<i>n</i>ti masyanghô aêdha, which are those _parts with_ the larger skin? Yô aparaya paiti mastraghnaya, whatever is behind the skull; (<i>A</i>farg [^2] said, from the ear backwards). Kaya kasyanghô, _which are those with the smaller?_ Yô paouruya paiti mastraghnaya, whatever is before _the skull_ [^3]. Vaghdhanem is the head, _and one_ says nar<i>s</i> vaghdhanem, &c., this is: Sinful are they _who_ penetrate (sûmbênd) a man's head, astem aêvô mastravanãm, _or_ one bone _of_ the skull; vîspa<i>k</i>a yô mastraghnãm amãsta, all those _are_ to be smitten who _have_ penetrated into the skull, _and_ to be given up _as_ outcast [^4]; <i>h</i><i>v</i>arô-<i>k</i>ithanãm [^5] aêt<i>e</i>ê anyê <i>k</i>ikayatô, the penalties of a Khôr [^6] _sin_ chastise those who _hurt_ other _parts_, (such as the brain which is in the skull of the head, and the _marrow_ of the other members _that are_ to be mentioned, just as it mentions this:—Sinful are they who strike through the bone, or flesh, or marrow of a leg, and every _one_ of those is to be smitten who strikes <span id="p473"><sup><small>[ p. 473 ]</small></sup></span> through the bone of one fleshy _part, and_ he is to be given up _as_ outcast; _while_ the penalties of a Khôr _sin_ [^7] chastise those who _hurt_ other _parts_).”’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XX, 116, probably refers to the passage which contained the statement thus quoted in Pahl. Vend. IV, 35: ‘That is, this is the account of the number of years, _according to_ that which is in the Hûspârûm as regards the account of the number; and _according to_ that which is in the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm _it is_ the account of the number of men.’

Dk. VIII, Chap. XX, 124, possibly refers to the passage which contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. X, 3:—‘In the exposition of the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm Nask it says that a man is going to commit robbery, _and_ a wall falls in upon him, _it is_ his destroyer; when a man strikes at him _he_ is his adversary, _and_ both are in sinfulness; when he is going to perform the ceremonial of the sacred beings both are in innocence _towards_ him.’

No allusion to the following six passages, quoted from this Nask, has been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chaps. XVI-XX:—

In Sls. X, 22, XII, 15, it is said as in the last fragment of the Spend N ask, already quoted.

In Sls. X, 23, XII, 16, it is said that ‘in the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm the high-priests _have_ taught thus:—“A man gives a hungry _one_ bread, _and it is_ too much, yet (_or_ when a man gives bread to a man, even though that man _has_ too much bread) all the good works, which he shall perform through that superabundance, <span id="p474"><sup><small>[ p. 474 ]</small></sup></span> become as much his _who gave it_ as though they had been done by his own hand.”’

In Pahl. Vend. V, 73, it is said ‘like unto this earth and that (sky) which would also cover over _it_ (ever in all _places_; there is _some one_ who says this is as to dead matter, that in the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm _says it is_ as to decision and judgment, and that in the Hûspârûm says it is as to the ritual of the ceremonial).’

In Vi<i>g</i>. p. 136, it is said that ‘_it is_ declared by the Avesta _of the_ Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm _thus:_—"Âa<i>d</i> ya<i>d</i> draonô Vana<i>n</i>tô stârô mazdadhâtô frâyazyâ<i>d</i>, <i>k</i>athwârô draonô frakere<i>n</i>te<i>n</i>ti aiwi-<i>h</i><i>v</i>are<i>n</i>ti, ya<i>d</i> aêshô nâ yô yao<i>z</i>dâthryô:—So when he, who is that man who is a purifier, shall consecrate the sacred cake of Vanand [^8], the star produced by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, they cut up and shall eat up four sacred cakes."’

In Vi<i>g</i>. pp. 180, 181, it is said that ‘in the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm it is stated:—Âa<i>d</i> aokhta Ahurô Mazd<i>a</i>u: "Ya<i>d</i> aêtê yô mazdayasna aêtem srîrem vastrem stehr-paêsanghem hvãm tanûm bâdha paoirîm vanghanem<i>k</i>a hadha varanô paitanem<i>k</i>a, pas<i>k</i>aiti aiwy<i>a</i>unghânô ava hê maidhyânem bû<i>g</i>yamanô." Aêtem zî srîrem vastrem mainyutâ<i>s</i>tem ha<i>k</i>a mainyavanãm dâmanãm avi mê fradadhâ<i>d</i> Ahurô Mazd<i>a</i>u ashava. "Yatha hê varanô paitanem asti mãnayen hvare-khshaêtahê, adhâ<i>d</i> hadha hê vastranãm yao<i>z</i>dâthranãm frâyaza vâ nizbaya vâ Ahurâi Mazdâi ameshanãm spe<i>n</i>tanãm, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!"—Thus spoke Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>: "When _for_ him, of those who are Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, _there is_ this beneficial, star-spangled (that is, wrought) garment [^9], always (after seven years _of age_, that is, <span id="p475"><sup><small>[ p. 475 ]</small></sup></span> after seven years _of age_) first he covers up (that is, clothes) his own body in it, and with (that _he_ is properly) a preserver of faith (that is, a preserver of attachment, and) he afterwards ties [^10] (that) girdle (over that starry _garment_) at the waist (as a waist-belt)." That, even this well-looking garment, spiritually formed by the creatures of the spirits, is really (that which) the righteous Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> granted me (who am Zaratû<i>s</i>t). "Since it is his preserver of faith, (that is, preserver of attachment), he is like (him who is as) the sun, (a preserver of beneficial faith, an implorer of the splendid heaven, and is _one_ who is an accepter _of_ the religion); therefore, with that garment, which is purified (that is, pure), do thou worship, or practise invocation, as regards Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and as regards the archangels, O Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t!"’

In Vi<i>g</i>. pp. 184, 185, it is said that ‘_it is_ declared by the Avesta of the Nihâ<i>d</i>ûm _thus:_—Âa<i>d</i> aêtahê pa<i>n</i><i>k</i>a ayara hamaspathmaidhem paiti ratûm spe<i>n</i>tay<i>a</i>u ârmatôi<i>s</i> mâunghô nôi<i>d</i> frasrâvayôi<i>d</i>:—So _one_ does not chant forth (that is, does not invoke) the month of (the completely mindful) Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^11] (that is, the Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> month) in the reign of those five Hatnaspa<i>d</i>mêdêm days [^12]; (for if _one_ invokes _it_, owing to forgetfulness, the Avesta is not accepted).’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (471:1) The very long account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains p. 472 4,876 Pahlavi words, from which the extent of its original text may be estimated (in the same way as in the case of Nask XVII) at about 62,600 Avesta and 562,900 Pahlavi words.

[^2]: (472:1) One of the old commentators whose statements are frequently quoted in the Pahlavi versions of the Avesta. The reading of his name and the age in which he lived are alike uncertain, but he appears to have been one of the earliest commentators whose opinions now survive.

[^3]: (472:2) Perhaps the quotation ends at this point; but Dk. VIII, Chap. XVIII, 3, is equally applicable to what follows.

[^4]: (472:3) Tanâpûhar, see Dk. VIII, Chap. XX, 65.

[^5]: (472:4) So in K20.

[^6]: (472:5) See Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXI, 39.

[^7]: (473:1) MH6 has va-aêvak kerp after mazg, and both K20 and MH6 have valman ba<i>r</i>â yehabûni<i>s</i>n; khôr tô<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nîhâ after tan<i>â</i>pûhar.

[^8]: (474:1) The southern leader of the stars, probably Fomalhaut. (see Bd. II, 7, V, I).

[^9]: (474:2) The sacred shirt.

[^10]: (475:1) This appears to be the reverse of the meaning of Av. bû<i>g</i>yamanô in Yt. I, 17, but see the first fragment of Nask XIV, quoted in Vi<i>g</i>. pp. 160, 161.

[^11]: (475:2) The last month of the Parsi year, named after the archangel Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> (see Dk. VIII, Chap. IX, 3).

[^12]: (475:3) The five intercalary days that follow the last month, in order to make the twelve months, of thirty days each, correspond with a year of 365 days. They coincide with the Hamaspa<i>d</i>mêdêm season-festival, originally intended to celebrate the vernal equinox.
