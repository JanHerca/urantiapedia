## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XIX.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The eighteenth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>\-mâ-yavâ [^5], is <span id="p207"><sup><small>[ p. 207 ]</small></sup></span> about the pregnancy of the demon from him who _has_ eaten _and_ chattered in sinfulness _towards_ Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> and Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^1], or who makes water _when_ standing [^2]) or who heedlessly sees _his_ semen. 2. And the hussy [^3] who spills (gûyê<i>d</i>ŏ) anything after sunset (hûk-frâshmôk-dâ<i>d</i>), _or_ who scatters a morsel (dânar) _of_ food to the north, _at_ night, without a recitation of the Ahunavair [^4].

3\. This, too, that only the soul is constantly desirable for the body, even through this alone, that this perishable body [^5] \[is a worldly state of righteousness, and, by rousing up (lâlâ-payami<i>s</i>nîh) [^6] when thou wouldst sleep on, the righteousness\] is on the advance when thou wouldst have retreated; and <span id="p208"><sup><small>[ p. 208 ]</small></sup></span> the righteousness, in arising, is like thee in every coming _and_ departure; through fetching _and_ delivering the breath it shall become good reward, abundant reward, and the reward of righteousness. 4. When the body shall act so, the soul is rejoiced _and_ shall utter a blessing for the body thus: ‘Happy may it be _for_ thee, O perishable body! whom I have made tall, _and_ whom I have brought near to the best existence.’ 5. And when the body shall not accept the progress (<i>a</i>frâs) of the soul, and says _it is_ evil progress on rousing up, evil progress on advancing, \[and evil progress upwards, the soul is a demon\]' and shall offer \[lamentable\] [^1] words thus: ‘Evil _art_ thou, O perishable body! whom I made dwarfish (ga<i>s</i>ûk), _and_ whom I have brought near to the worst existence.’

6\. About where _there are_ unaccustomed (avê<i>s</i>akŏ), imperfect, and secret signs of short life, and the healthfulness _of_ uttering the Ahunavair [^2] _and_ Ashem [^3] for it. 7. This, too, that, when thou wouldst squat for making water, thou recitest the Ahunavair, and the Ashem, afterwards, when thou wouldst stand up; so that _any_ demon, _or_ fiend, shall least injure thee. 8. And when thou wouldst go in unto _thy_ wife (nârîk), thou recitest first the Ahunavair, and the Ashem, afterwards, when thou wouldst be coming together [^4]; for so thou wouldst be making that, too, _which_ arises—which is thy son—more righteous and <span id="p209"><sup><small>[ p. 209 ]</small></sup></span> more successful through the Ashem. 9. This, too, that, when thou wouldst go into a house, thou shouldst be offering homage, and do thou utter the Ahunavair, _for_ the spirit of the house and _for_ every_thing_ of the material _existence_ of the righteous which is and was and _will_ be in that dwelling.

10\. Also about the corruption (tava<i>s</i>tanŏ) of the wicked, and the calamity (sûr) which is unjustly distributed by them in the realm [^1].

11\. Excellence _that is_ perfect is righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^5]: (206:5) The first three words of the third hâ of the third Gâtha (Yas. XLIX, 1), here written a<i>d</i>\-mâ-îyûbŏ in Pahlavi.

[^1]: (207:1) Av. haurvatât, ‘completeness, or health,’ and ameretât, ‘immortality;’ the archangels who have special charge of water and plants, respectively (see Sls. XV, 25-29), and are said to be injured by the sin of talking while eating and drinking those things (see Chap. IX, 2).

[^2]: (207:2) Thereby polluting more ground than is necessary (see Sls. X, 5).

[^3]: (207:3) See Chap. XI, 5 n.

[^4]: (207:4) K does not mention the latter sinful action. The reason of the sin of such actions is that they may be considered as offerings to the demons (who are supposed to come from the north and to be powerful at night) unless protected by the Ahunavair (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7) used as an exorcism (see Sd. XXX, 1, 2; Sls. X, 7, XII, 18).

[^5]: (207:5) B has ‘even through the assertion that this is corporeal and perishable.’ The passage in brackets occurs only in K.

[^6]: (207:6) This appears to be the most probable reading of the word which occurs again in § 5, where it is written lâlâ-ûpayami<i>s</i>nîh in K, which form is also found in Hn. I, 23, where it translates Av. ustryamnô. For the latter member of this compound see also Chap. XX, 6, 7. For the syllable yam we might substitute gam or <i>g</i>am without much alteration of meaning, or even dam if we translate by ‘fanning up, exciting.’

[^1]: (208:1) The words in brackets are omitted in K.

[^2]: (208:2) See Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7.

[^3]: (208:3) See Chap. III, 1; here, and in §§ 7, 8, it is expressed by Pahl. aharâyîh, ‘righteousness,’ being an abbreviation of its usual appellation, ‘praise of righteousness,’ in Pahlavi.

[^4]: (208:4) Pahl. ‘amat andarg hakhtô vadîdûnâñ <i>a</i><i>ê</i>.’

[^1]: (209:1) Like Yas. XLIX this fargar<i>d</i> begins with special references to the wicked, and returns to them towards the end.
