## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LV.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The ninth fargar<i>d</i>, Yathâi<i>s</i> [^1], is _that_ by him who praises Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _his_ work in the Gâthic lore [^2] is taught; even for this reason, because the reason of the praise even of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is for _his_ works, _and_ by him who extols any work the performance <span id="p343"><sup><small>[ p. 343 ]</small></sup></span> of that work is also taught; _moreover_ the work of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _which is_ the Gâthic lore, is pure goodness. 2. This, too, that by him who increases the propagators of good works priestly-controlled action (ra<i>d</i>îk-kûni<i>s</i>nîh) [^3] is taught; even for this reason, because the advancement of merit and the action of priestly chieftainship are the two maxims (vâ<i>k</i>akŏ) of one who, when _there_ is reason, exalts progressive merit when he increases the propagators of good works; and when progressive merit is exalted priestly-controlled action is praised and also taught.

3\. This, too, that what is worthy, _and_ what is coveted for every worthy _man_, is produced by him for whom the command of the liturgy is the reckoning for him who is habitually sagacious; and this statement also indicates the explanation of rulers _and_ all who are needing those of the world for one combined effort, who, in the immature world, _have_ to trust a command that is _at_ one time sagacious. 4. This, too, that personal assistance is liberally given (râ<i>d</i>îni<i>d</i>ŏ) to the creatures of the good _beings_ by him whose deeds are an assistance of the renovation _of the universe;_ and this statement, too, also indicates the great power _of_ any good work whatever, because every good work, _being_ an assistance of the renovation, becomes liberality _to_ the immature (khâm) creation.

5\. This, too, that whoever teaches to a son reverence unto _his_ father has also appropriated the reward for reverence unto the creator for teaching that person; even for this reason, because express reverence unto parents and service to them are connected <span id="p344"><sup><small>[ p. 344 ]</small></sup></span> with reverence unto the creator and service to him. 6. This, too, that whoever is personally progress for him who is his own [^4]—that is, for any one whatever among those who are needing him—becomes the happiness of the creator who is the maker of the original good creations; and this statement also indicates as to whom _it is_, when, through him whose decision is progress—which _arises_ through that which _occurs_ when the decision is given that becomes for every one that which is needful for him—there is happiness that is concentrated. 7. This, too, that by him who is causing benefit for him who is a cultivator cattle [^5] are multiplied; even for this reason, because a gratifier of the performers of tillage is multiplying tillage, _and_ cattle are the chief tillage of the world.

8\. This, too, that the religion which is the way of righteousness is made his own [^6] by him who is a good thinker about the religion of righteousness; and this statement, too, also indicates the limit of reliance (asti<i>s</i>nŏ) upon the good religion; because whoever is not a good thinker about the good religion, even though he be a reciter of revelation, becomes really an apostate; whoever is a good thinker, _but_ not about the good religion, becomes really an infidel; and whoever thinks truly becomes a good thinker about religious righteousness and the statements in the good religion. 9. And about three statements, the bringer forward _for_ all mankind is your submission to the sacred beings; one is of the produce (bar), one of the origin (bûn), and <span id="p345"><sup><small>[ p. 345 ]</small></sup></span> one of the body and life; that of the produce is the exertion from which _there_ is produce, that of the origin is the advantage for which the origin is requisite, and that of the body and life is the thought of the proposer (râyînî<i>d</i>âr), which considered both as submission _to_ the sacred beings. 10. This, too, that connected with the sitting-place of the sage is the excessiveness _of_ the pleasure [^7] for those causing pleasure, for the upper classes (<i>a</i><i>v</i>arîgânŏ) of Irân, _and_ for the energy (patûkîh) [^7] of the diligent.

11\. Excellence _that is_ perfect is righteousness.
