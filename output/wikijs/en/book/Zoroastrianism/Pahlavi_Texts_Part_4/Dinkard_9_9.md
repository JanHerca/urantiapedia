## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER IX.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The eighth fargar<i>d</i>, <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaiti [^4], is about the abstinence of mankind, for special propitiation, from _being_ unreliant _upon_ religion, on account of reverence for the evil spirit [^5]; that from the habit of <span id="p182"><sup><small>[ p. 182 ]</small></sup></span> _being_ ungirdled, on account of reverence for Andar [^1] and that for <i>S</i>ôvar [^2]; that from walking with one boot [^3], on account of reverence for Tâûr<i>v</i>ŏ and Zârî<i>k</i>ŏ [^4]; that from being harmfully inquisitorial, on account of reverence for Akatâsh [^5]; and that from the habit of _being_ without a serpent-scourge, on account of reverence for all the demons [^6].

2\. About the hungry intention (gu<i>s</i>nakŏ-mîni<i>s</i>nîh) of him who eats [^7] _and_ drinks chattering; the delight of the demons on that account; and advice as regards not speaking a word during eating and drinking. 3. As to the praise and gratification of the sacred beings before eating and drinking, <span id="p183"><sup><small>[ p. 183 ]</small></sup></span> and also on finishing; and the purity [^1] of the mouth owing to its praise of righteousness [^2]. 4. About him whose ownership of any good work, that they [^3] may perform, does not attain to the best existence, on account of not possessing a high-priest by habit.

5\. About the period of the ceremonial of Srôsh [^4], the righteous, _being_ mostly on the passing away of the first half of the night, and the announcement [^5] of him who is the celebrator (ya<i>s</i>târ) is for his protection from the fiend spirit. 6. The period of the ceremonial of Rashnû [^6] and Â<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i> [^7] is mostly after that, in the jurisdiction (ra<i>d</i>îh) of the Aûshahîn [^8], and the announcement of him who is the celebrator is abundance of grain. 7. The period of the ceremonial of Mit<i>r</i>ô [^9] of the wide cattle-pastures, and _of_ the spirit of the pleasure of eating [^10], is mostly in the <span id="p184"><sup><small>[ p. 184 ]</small></sup></span> jurisdiction of the Hâvan [^1], and the announcement of him who is the celebrator is a flock of sheep. 8. The period of the ceremonial of Ashavahi<i>s</i>t [^2], and also _of_ the fire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is mostly in the jurisdiction of the Rapithwin [^3], and the announcement of him who is the celebrator is an assemblage of righteousness. 9. The period of the ceremonial of the lofty lord _of_ females, the descendant of waters [^4], and also _of_ the water created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is mostly in the jurisdiction of the Aûzâêrin [^5], and the announcement of him who is the celebrator is a troop of heroes (vîrân ramakŏ). 10. And the period of the ceremonial of the guardian spirits of the righteous, _of_ the females with troops of heroes and years _of_ pleasant dwelling, _of_ the might which is well-formed and handsome, as well as victorious and created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and _of_ the fighting which is in the ascendant [^6], is mostly in the jurisdiction of the Aiwisrûthrim [^7], and the announcement of him who is the celebrator is the origin of all excellence, <span id="p185"><sup><small>[ p. 185 ]</small></sup></span> and the produce of all manifestation of righteousness.

11\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

## Footnotes

[^4]: (181:4) The appellation of the fifth hâ of the first Gâtha (Yas. XXXII) which begins with the words a<i>h</i><i>v</i>yâ<i>k</i>â <i>h</i><i>v</i>aêtu<i>s</i>; it is here written khvatamaîtŏ in Pahlavi in both MSS.

[^5]: (181:5) Compare Yas. XXXII, 3.

[^1]: (182:1) Av. Andra, or I<i>n</i>dra; one of the arch-demons produced by the evil spirit, and the special opponent of the archangel Ashavahi<i>s</i>t; he seduces from virtue and opposes the use of the sacred shirt and girdle (see Bd. I, 27, XXVIII, 8, 10, XXX, 29; Ep. I, x, 9; Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 1).

[^2]: (182:2) Av. Sauru; another of the arch-demons and the special opponent of the archangel Shatvaîrô; he encourages anarchy and drunkenness, and opposes the use of the sacred shirt and girdle (see Bd. I, 27, XXVIII, 9, 10, XXX, 29; Ep. I, X, 9).

[^3]: (182:3) Probably equivalent to ‘walking in stockings,’ though some think it means ‘walking barefoot.’ It is sinful on account of the risk of pollution from stepping on impurities.

[^4]: (182:4) Av. Tauru and Zairi<i>k</i>a; two more of the arch-demons and the special opponents of the archangels Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> and Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i>; they produce and diffuse poison, and are propitiated by walking with one boot (see Bd. I, 27, XXVIII, 11, 13, XXX, 29; Ep. 1. X, 9).

[^5]: (182:5) Av. Akatasha; ‘the fiend of inquisitiveness, who makes the creatures look away from proper things’ (Bd. XXVIII, 20), and appears to be closely connected with the demon Aeshm, ‘wrath.’

[^6]: (182:6) See Bd. XXVIII, 21, 22, and Bk. VIII, Chap. XVIII, 2.

[^7]: (182:7) B omits ‘eats.’ Talking during eating is sinful because the eater has muttered an inward prayer, as a protective spell, the good effect of which would be destroyed by speaking aloud (compare Bk. VIII, Chap. XLIII, 37).

[^1]: (183:1) K has ‘protection.’

[^2]: (183:2) That is, its muttering the Ashem-vohû formula which is recited thrice, as a conclusion of the inward prayer (see Dd. LXXIX, 1 n).

[^3]: (183:3) Or it may be ‘he,’ as the optative 3rd plural is often used for the singular; but it is a doctrine of the religion that a person who causes good works to be done by others, as he does when he employs a priest to perform ceremonies, is as much the owner of the good works as the actual performer is (see Sls. X, 22, 23 for cases of less direct agency).

[^4]: (183:4) See Bk. VIII, Chaps. IX, 3, XLIV, 16, and Pahl. Yas. I, 22.

[^5]: (183:5) As an offering, referring to the verb nivaêdhayêmi, ‘I announce or invite,’ with which most of the clauses of Yas. I. commence.

[^6]: (183:6) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XX, 153, and Pahl. Yas. I, 23.

[^7]: (183:7) Av. Ar<i>s</i>tâ<i>d</i>, ‘rectitude,’ a female angel who assists the soul on its way to the other world (see AV. V, 3).

[^8]: (183:8) The period from midnight till dawn (see Bk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 9).

[^9]: (183:9) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XLIV, i6.

[^10]: (183:10) Av. râma <i>h</i><i>v</i>âstrem, Pahl. râmi<i>s</i>nŏ khvârôm, who cooperates with Mit<i>r</i>ô (see Pahl. Yas. I, 9).

[^1]: (184:1) The period from dawn till noon, and in winter it extends into the afternoon (see Bd. XXV, 9-14).

[^2]: (184:2) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XXXVII, 14, and Pahl. Yas. I, 12.

[^3]: (184:3) The afternoon till 3 p<i>m</i>. during summer (see Bd. XXV, 9-14). Here written Rapis<i>v</i>ag.

[^4]: (184:4) Av. berezatô ahurahê nafedhrô apãm, Pahl. bûr’<i>z</i>and khû<i>d</i>âî nekedân-î <i>â</i><i>v</i>ânŏ nâpô (see Pahl. Yas. I, 15).

[^5]: (184:5) The evening from the middle of the afternoon till dusk (see Bd. XXV, 9; Sls. XXI, 4-7).

[^6]: (184:6) See Pahl. Yas. I, 18, 19.

[^7]: (184:7) The period from dusk till midnight; here written ay<i>î</i><i>v</i>îk-srûksrîm. It will be noticed that the periods for the ceremonials of the beings here detailed correspond with those with which their names are connected in Yas. I, 3-7, II, 3-7, III, 5-9, IV, 8-12, VI, 2-6, VII, 5-9 (W.).
