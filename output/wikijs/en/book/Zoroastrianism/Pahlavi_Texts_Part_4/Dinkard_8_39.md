One section is the <i>H</i>a<i>k</i>î<i>d</i>akânistân (‘_code of sequestrations_’), particulars about a statement of seized property, the retention thereof, _and_ how was the confinement _of_ that _which was_ animate; how it is when _one_ keeps _it_ in a shepherd's-dog's care, and how it is when in the sequestrator's care (<i>h</i>a<i>k</i>î<i>d</i>akŏdârîh). 2. And when _it is_ a seized horse of the warriors, how to keep _it_ when it is not possible to retain _it_ in confinement _of_ any kind, and the damage which _has_ arisen therefrom; what is the danger to occasion by it, how it is when the shelter (srâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) [^1] is on all sides, _and_ how it is when on one side; while the trust, when _there is_ shelter, is in the extent of the shelter, how much _and of_ what kind is the shelter. 3. When _it is_ a seized beast _of burden_, after _its_ coming into the possession of the sequestrator (<i>h</i>a<i>k</i>î<i>d</i>ak-dâr), for how long _he has_ to order work for the reasoning thought of the herdsman, _and_ how is that of the sequestrator, _in_ like manner, before he quite attains to his share; even through his own reasoning thought the work is authorisedly ordered, and how _and in_ what manner is the ordering of his work. 4. And when the seized _animal_ has offspring, _in_ what mode _he has_ to milk _it_, as well as the nourishment of the young, and whatever is on the same subject; _also_ the sin owing to doing _it_ unlawfully.

5\. About the sequestrator when the beast _of burden_ seized comes into his possession, how it is <span id="p132"><sup><small>[ p. 132 ]</small></sup></span> when its special reputation is altered, _and_ how it is when it comes with utility and advantage for him. 6. About the seizer's keeping a sheep, which is seized, in _his_ flock; that is, how the custom is produced, owing to its milk _being_ for the _sacred_ feast, and the notification of the feasts is owing to the seized [^2] sheep; when, too, it is not possible to keep _it_ in the flock, what is the mode of confining _it_; and when it is not possible to keep _it_ in confinement, what _he has_ to do with it. 7. About the wool of a sheep which is seized; that is, how it is when the shearing is even before the various times specified, _and_ the sin of shearing when _it is_ before the time specified, _or one_ shears when there is no reason for shearing. 8. About the lambing (gurû<i>s</i>î<i>d</i>ŏ) of the sheep seized, and the sin owing to _its_ not lambing.

9\. About sheltering (sru<i>d</i>anŏ) [^3] the seized _animal_ in the most public place in a house, village, community, _or_ province. 10. About the sin of the shepherd when, without saving _it_ for the sequestrator, _and_ through the guilelessness of the sequestrator, he shall carry away a female; _and_ the sin which is owing to the offence as regards unlawfully beating _and_ wounding _it_, before _it is_ seized for the buyers of meat (khûr-kharânŏ), _and_ other offences regarding it. 11. About the time appointed, between the shepherd and the sequestrator, for leading _and_ bringing the female, _belonging to_ the sequestrator, to the place for which the time is appointed; _in_ the case when the shepherd arrives _and_ the sequestrator _does_ <span id="p133"><sup><small>[ p. 133 ]</small></sup></span> not, how that which _belongs to_ the sequestrator is to come into the possession of the sequestrator, and when; when _it is_ the sheep _or_ beast _of burden_ of a sequestrator [^4], how _it is_ to come into the possession of that sequestrator; when the sheep _or_ beast _of burden_ which is seized dies in the possession of the sequestrator, how _and_ how long _he has_ to shelter (srû<i>d</i>an) the young ones (gurû<i>s</i>) and wool of the same several sheep; _and_ the sin when he does not shelter _them_, or _does it_ otherwise.

12\. About a sheep [^5] which is mingled among the flock of any one that is in sequestration, how it is when the shepherd, _and_ how it is when the shepherd's dog, is its own; and when it is mingled among any flock owing to sequestration, how it is when the shepherd, _and_ how it is when the shepherd's dog, \[who is its own\] [^6] goes to another flock; how it is when the first flock-owner, _and_ how it is when the second, is its own. 13. About the killing of a seized sheep _by_ a shepherd's dog for necessary provisions; that is, how _it is_ allowable, and _in_ what mode _it is_ to be done.

14\. About him unto whom the sheep _or_ beast _of burden_ which is seized _is delivered_ when it comes into a district; _and_ the sequestrator's informing the governor of the district, in whose herd the sheep _or_ beast _of burden_ which is seized _remains_, as to the species, colour, and form of it [^7]. 15.

When it is found within the road, and the ground is hard, how it is when it is two finger_\-breadths_ below, and how it is when _it is_ three finger_\-breadths;_ _and_ when the ground is soft, how it is when it is three finger_\-breadths_ below, _and_ how it is when _it is_ four finger_\-breadths_. 20.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (131:1) Av. thrâ.

[^2]: (132:1) Instead of <i>h</i>a<i>k</i>î<i>d</i>akŏ, ‘seized,’ the MS. has the very similarly written word <i>a</i><i>v</i><i>ê</i><i>z</i>akŏ, ‘pure.’

[^3]: (132:2) Compare srâyi<i>s</i>nŏ in § 2, and srû<i>d</i>an in § 11.

[^4]: (133:1) Perhaps another sequestrator is meant.

[^5]: (133:2) The first case seems to be that of an unseized sheep in a seized flock, and the second that of a seized sheep in an unseized flock.

[^6]: (133:3) The words in brackets are supplied by guess, to fill up a blank space left by the repairer of the MS. on one of his patches.

[^7]: (133:4) Reading va-darand-î denman.

[^8]: (134:1) Reading h<i>â</i><i>z</i>akŏ, but it is possibly a contracted form of ay<i>â</i><i>v</i>akŏ, ‘gain.’

[^9]: (134:2) If it were allowable to omit this word, âyûînakŏ, ‘variety,’ and to substitute ‘gain’ for ‘distraction,’ the sentence would stand as follows:—‘About the gain of a sequestrator as regards a sheep _or_ beast _of burden_ which is seized, when he nourishes _it for_ one-fourth, when for one-third, when _for_ half a year, and when _for_ the duration of a _whole_ year.’ This seems more intelligible than the text as it stands in the MS.

[^10]: (135:1) Supposing that Pâz. âava<i>d</i> is intended for âfrapa<i>d</i>.

[^11]: (135:2) That is, up to the shin.

[^12]: (136:1) The utility of these minute details was probably to determine how long the treasure had been buried, and for what purpose, and whether there was any possibility of the rightful owner being still alive.

[^13]: (136:2) Reading darand-î denman.

[^14]: (136:3) Supposing that pês stands for pâh.
