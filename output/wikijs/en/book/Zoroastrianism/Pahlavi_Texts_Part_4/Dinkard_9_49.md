## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XLIX.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The third fargar<i>d</i> is the YêNhê-hâtãm [^4]: there is here taught by it the worship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, which is the law of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, that is, its law is virtuous [^5]. 2. This, too, that the worship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is occasioned by it, which is the asking for life for beings _by_ mankind [^5]. 3. _And_ this, too, that the ritual of the males and females of the righteous occurs _through_ it, which is the obeisance for the archangels [^6]. 4. And the atonement <span id="p310"><sup><small>[ p. 310 ]</small></sup></span> _for_ crimes (va<i>g</i>agânŏ), because it is a gratification, is all for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> personally therefrom; and in connection therewith it amounts to a gratification for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

5\. Here _one_ mentions three particulars [^1] which are in one's worship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> of every description. 6. One is when the design (dâ<i>d</i>ŏ) of the person is virtuous, because it is restrained by some virtuousness of thought; this is that which amounts to worship and obeisance _for_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> personally. 7. One is when it teaches an asking for life for mankind, and its ordinance is the protection, nourishment, _and_ other assistance _and_ gratification _of_ mankind; a friend of the primitive worldly creation of mankind produced it, _and_ it comes into connection _with_ the bridge _judgment_ of mankind, for the worship _and_ gratification of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 8. _And_ one is when _one_ would celebrate the obeisance _for_ the archangels, which is for the sake of strengthening the archangels, each separately, in _their_ control of the business of preparing _and_ managing the world; because _it_ is declared by revelation _that_ to worship is this, that the ceremonial _may_ reach this bridge [^2] in company with _one_ (pa<i>d</i>vand), for the worship _and_ gratification of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; the archangel who is to be strengthened by the ceremonial is one, _and_ mankind are developed by the strength of the archangel.

9\. Of righteousness perfect is the excellence.
