## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IV [^2].

1\. Obeisance _to_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion which is opposed to the demons _and_ is the ordinance of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. <span id="p411"><sup><small>[ p. 411 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. The fourth _book_ is matter for instruction from the statements selected, from the instruction of the good religion, by the saintly (hû-fravar<i>d</i>ŏ) Âtû<i>r</i>\-farnbag [^1], son of Farukhŏ-zâ<i>d</i> _and_ leader of those of the good religion.

3\. From the Selection of Customary Instruction [^2] there is _this:—Number_ one is the actual original evolution [^3], resembling only himself _and_ not designed (<i>k</i>imîk). 4. _Number_ two, the duplication of the first among those akin (khvê<i>s</i>îgân) owing to the consciousness of creation—which is the first—is Vohûman; but _it is_ his origin, concealed from the destroyer, which is the reason of the creation.

.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

10\. _Number_ three is the original creature Ashavahi<i>s</i>t [^4]—due to development among those akin, one out of another—who possesses the third place among the archangels, for the reverence of the first.

.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

12\. _Number_ four, the perfect sovereignty among <span id="p412"><sup><small>[ p. 412 ]</small></sup></span> those akin, is named Shatraver [^1], the necessity of the stored-up (a<i>v</i>ar-gû<i>d</i>ŏ) nature of a spiritual lord arisen from the reverence of the perfectly just doer Ashavahi<i>s</i>t, who is the third in arising from him who is the second, Vohûman, who is the first creature.     .     .     .     .       19. So, too, the sovereignty of the religion is ever specially good sovereignty _and_ triumphant, and the true religion is confident; the will of the sacred beings in the world is progress, and the comprisal of every knowledge is in the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion; the correct attainment of its good sovereignty and their joint statement are together really on account of their concealed good protection and progressive production, one for the other. 20. They strive for the powerful maintenance of the religious good monarchy of rulers, trusty _in_ religion through practising Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship; the law of the rulers is custom, and their custom is religious.

21\. Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^2], the king when he became relieved (pardakhtŏ) from the war with Ar’<i>g</i>âsp [^3], sent to the chief rulers about the acceptance of the religion, ‘and the writings [^4] _of_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, which are studded with all knowledge through resources and learning of many kinds, and _also_ the tongue _of_ a Magian man (Magôî-gab<i>r</i>â), arisen _in_ the very same instructed duty, it is expedient you _should_ send (<i>s</i>ed<i>r</i>ûnê<i>d</i>ŏ) _there_with.’ 22. Now <span id="p413"><sup><small>[ p. 413 ]</small></sup></span> Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>râs<i>p</i>ô [^1], _and_ others from outside _of_ Khvanîras [^2], came to Frashô<i>s</i>tar for religious enquiry, with complete intelligence _for_ the most who did _so_.

23\. Dârâî [^3], son of Dârâî, ordered the preservation of two written copies of the whole Avesta _and_ Zand, according to the receiving _of it by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; one in the treasury of Shapîgân [^4], _and_ one in the fortress of written _documents_.

24\. Valkha<i>s</i> [^5], descendant of A<i>s</i>kân, in _each_ district, just as he had come forth, ordered the careful preservation, _and_ making of memoranda for the royal city (shat<i>r</i>ô shahag), of the Avesta _and_ Zand as it had purely come unto _them, and_ also of whatever instruction (âmûkŏ-<i>k</i>), due to it, had remained written about, as well as deliverable by the tongue through a high-priest, in a scattered state in the country of Irân, owing to the ravages and devastation of Alexander and the cavalry and infantry of the Arûmans [^6]. <span id="p414"><sup><small>[ p. 414 ]</small></sup></span> 25\. That (valman-1-î) A<i>r</i>takhshatar [^1], king of kings, who _was_ son of Pâpak, summoned Tôsar, _and_ also all that scattered instruction (âmûkŏ), as true authority, to the capital; Tôsar _having_ arrived, him alone he approved, and, dismissing the rest of the high-priests, he also gave this command, namely: ‘For us every other exposition of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion becomes removed, because even now there is no information _or_ knowledge of it below.’

26\. Shahpûhar [^2], king of kings _and_ son of A<i>r</i>takhshatar, again brought together also the writings which _were_ distinct from religion, about the investigation of medicine and astronomy, time, place, _and_ quality, creation (dahi<i>s</i>nŏ), existence, _and_ destruction (vinâsi<i>s</i>nŏ), the submission of a wild beast [^3], evidence, and other records and resources _that_ were scattered among the Hindûs, _and in_ Arûm [^4] and other lands; and he ordered _their_ collocation again with the Avesta, _and_ the presentation of a correct copy of each to the treasury of Shapîgân [^5]; and the settlement (astînî<i>d</i>anŏ) of all the erring upon the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, for proper consideration, was effected.

27\. Shahpûhar [^6], king of kings _and_ son of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, instituted a tribunal (<i>â</i><i>v</i>ân âhankŏ ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>ŏ) for the controversy of the inhabitants of all regions, <span id="p415"><sup><small>[ p. 415 ]</small></sup></span> and brought all statements to proper consideration and investigation; _and_ after the preservation of Âtû<i>r</i>pâ<i>d</i> [^1], through the statement which he maintained (pasâkhtŏ) with all those _of_ different sects, and the Nasks were enumerated, he also spoke this even _to_ those who _were_ heterodox, namely: ‘Now, when the religion is recognised by us in the worldly _existence_, we do most diligently endeavour _that_ they shall not allow the infidelity (agdênôîh) of any one whatever;’ and he acted accordingly.

28\. This (le-denman-1-î [^2]) Khûsrôî [^3], king of kings _who is_ son of Kavâ<i>d</i>, as apostasy and tyranny _were_ fully antagonistically smitten by him [^4], and information and redoubled proper consideration _were_ abundantly augmented—through a declaration from the religion unto every apostasy of the four classes (pî<i>s</i>akŏ)—also spoke even this as to winning the sacred beings (ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân kharî<i>d</i>îh), namely: ‘The truth of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion is fully understood, _and_ the intelligent _are_ steadfastly capable through proper consideration; but recognition by the worldly _existence has_ mostly become exceedingly scattered, _and_ the particulars are not possible through proper consideration, but through purity _of_ thought, <span id="p416"><sup><small>[ p. 416 ]</small></sup></span> word, and deed, and the statements of the good spirit, the liturgical ceremonial of the sacred beings with purity.

29\. ‘We also call, each of those called by us, a priest of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, whose perception of the spiritual _existence_ is manifested unto us; and our wide resources, the perception of the spiritual _existence and_ the example of the worldly _one_, are likewise indications _of_ both natures _that are_ complete. 30. And we invite (bavîhûnêm) those invited [^1], even with that excellence _and_ efficiency which are due to them, on account of which the sacred beings are predominantly over Irân; the country of Irân _having_ proceeded onwards through instruction from the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion which the ancients celebrated. 31. The knowledge _of_ the sociable ceremonial (ham-ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîh)—for which, indeed, those of the intelligent of disunited Khvanîras are not in a dispute of antagonism—is, _in_ that way, mostly the sonorous (aêv<i>â</i><i>z</i>îk) Avesta, in the pure statement of the writing adornable by memoranda of particulars; and even the simple wordless (av<i>â</i><i>k</i>îk) mode is maintained in the announcement of the statement.

32\. ‘Even then all the domestic (khânîk) knowledge of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion is really on this account, which is understood by us, that, when all are intellectual (vîr-hômônd), and the proper consideration of a stranger (bîgânakŏ) is owing to the world of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, they arrive at this place. 33. _But_ through the new possession and proper consideration _of_ the stranger, owing to the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, they are <span id="p417"><sup><small>[ p. 417 ]</small></sup></span> not capable of bringing about so much acquirement _and_ manifestation of knowledge, for the advantage and open duty of the worldly existence, as is in the recitation of a priestly master through much investigation, and is abundantly well-considered. 34. And. if we command, with the utmost solicitude, the proper consideration of the Avesta and Zand of the primitive Magian statements (Magôî-gobi<i>s</i>nŏ), which are more humbly observant, better disposed, good, _and_ ever renewed uneffacedly, _as well as_ an increase of acquirement worthily therefrom, for the knowledge of those _of_ the world, _there is_ no necessity of first acquiring the quality of creation from the creator, _by_ those who are worldly _existences_, for understanding the creator and the marvellousness _of_ the spiritual _existences;_ or all necessity of acquiring is said _to be_ longing through scanty knowledge.

35\. ‘They who are a counterpart (aê<i>d</i>ûnŏîh) of manifestation from the religion—and even through the resemblance _there_ is a possibility of the existence of understanding—_are_ mentioned as effecting proper consideration (hû-sikâl-gar); and he who _has_ to exhibit enlightenment (rôshanô) through knowledge, _has_ to maintain acquaintance _with_ the religion. 36. And since the origin of every knowledge is the religion, alike through spiritual power, and alike through worldly manifestation [^1], that which any one _has_ wisely spoken—even though not considered by him _as_ similarly beheld (ham-dî<i>d</i>ŏ) by any Avesta declaration—is still then accounted as a manifestation from the religion, whose business is <span id="p418"><sup><small>[ p. 418 ]</small></sup></span> bringing forth offspring for the sacred beings through instruction.’

37 [^1].     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

## Footnotes

[^2]: (410:2) This book commences with an account of the seven archangels, and, illustrative of the ‘desirable dominion’ personified in Shatraver, the fourth of them, a statement is made of the legendary history of the efforts made by the good rulers, from Vi<i>s</i>tâsp to Khûsrôî Anôsharavân, for the preservation of Avesta and Pahlavi p. 411 literature. Most of this statement has been already translated at the end of Haug's Essay on Pahlavi, from a less perfect MS. than B, but, as some of the accompanying text is obscure, it has now been necessary to translate the whole of it to ascertain its connection clearly, although only so much of this translation is here given as will indicate this connection in a general way.

[^1]: (411:1) Who held a religious disputation with the accursed Abâli<i>s</i> in the presence of the Khalîfah Al-Mâmûn (A.D. 813-833), as stated in the Mâ<i>d</i>îgân-î Gu<i>g</i>astak Abâli<i>s</i>. He appears to have been the first compiler of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, especially of its first two Books which are still undiscovered (see Dk. III, Chap. last, 9, in Introduction; Sg, IV, 107, IX, 3, X, 55). Dk. IV, V are taken from his statements, as well as a portion of Dk. III, Chap. CXLII.

[^2]: (411:2) Âyûînŏ âmûkŏ vi<i>g</i>înŏ, evidently the name of a treatise compiled by Âtû<i>r</i>\-farnbag.

[^3]: (411:3) That is, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

[^4]: (411:4) See Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVII, 14.

[^1]: (412:1) See Dk. IX, Chap. XLIII, 1.

[^2]: (412:2) See Dk. VIII, Chaps. XI, 1, XIII, 15.

[^3]: (412:3) Ibid. XI, 4.

[^4]: (412:4) Haug's MS. omits this passage: va<i>l</i> sar-khû<i>d</i>âyân madam pa<i>d</i>îrôftanŏ-î dênô firîstakŏ, va-nipîkîhâ-î; and, even when it is supplied from B, a few more words appear to be still wanting.

[^1]: (413:1) Evidently the same person as Arezrâs<i>p</i>âh (Dk. IX, Chap. XXI, 24), the supreme high-priest of the northern region Vîda<i>d</i>afsh (Bd. XXIX, 1). In Dk. VII it is also stated that S<i>p</i>îtôî<i>s</i> and Are<i>z</i>râs<i>p</i>ô came to Frashô<i>s</i>tar, seeking information about the religion, 57 years after it had been received by Zaratû<i>s</i>t who appears to have departed to the best existence ten years before.

[^2]: (413:2) See Dk. VIII, Chap. VIII, 2.

[^3]: (413:3) According to Bd. XXXIV, 8 and the Persian Rivâyats, which teach a chronology of their own, this Dârâî was the predecessor of Alexander and reigned fourteen years; his father reigning twelve years.

[^4]: (413:4) It is hazardous to read ‘the royal (shâyagân) treasury’ because the name, which occurs seven times in the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, is five times spelt Shapîgân, and twice Shas<i>p</i>îgân.

[^5]: (413:5) Probably Vologeses I, who was a contemporary of Nero and appears to have been a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper (see S.B.E., vol. iv, p. xxxiv).

[^6]: (413:6) The older Greeks were so called by the Persians in Sasanian p. 414 times, because they came from the same quarter as the later armies of the eastern empire of the Romans.

[^1]: (414:1) The first Sasanian king, who reigned A.D. 226-240.

[^2]: (414:2) The second Sasanian king, who reigned A.D. 240-271.

[^3]: (414:3) Doubtful; but it is difficult to find a more probable meaning for da<i>d</i>akŏ hêrîh.

[^4]: (414:4) The eastern empire of the Romans.

[^5]: (414:5) See § 23.

[^6]: (414:6) The ninth Sasanian king, who reigned A.D. 309-379.

[^1]: (415:1) See Dk. VIII, Chap. I, 22.

[^2]: (415:2) Literally ‘this one who is,’ which, applied to a person near at hand, is a phrase analogous to valman-1-î, ‘that one who is,’ applied in § 25 to a person more remote. The oblique case le-denman of the demonstrative pronoun, which occurs very rarely, is analogous to the oblique cases li, lanman, lak, lekûm of the personal pronouns, which occur constantly.

[^3]: (415:3) The twentieth Sasanian king, who reigned A.D. 531-579; he was surnamed Anôsharavân, ‘immortal-soulled.’

[^4]: (415:4) Referring to his extirpation of the heresy of Mazdak, A.D. 528, before he came to the throne.

[^1]: (416:1) As in Yas. II.

[^1]: (417:1) Assuming that pê<i>d</i>âkîh-înî<i>d</i>ârîh stands for pê<i>d</i>âkînî<i>d</i>ârîh.

[^1]: (418:1) Then follows a briefer account of the remaining three archangels.
