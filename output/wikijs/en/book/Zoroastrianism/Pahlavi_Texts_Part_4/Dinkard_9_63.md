## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LXIII.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The seventeenth fargar<i>d</i>, Yêzî [^3], is _that_ whoever maintains the benedictions of the religion [^4], and shall uphold its commands, has thereby made even others learn it; even for this reason, because through this _it_ is much more possible for him to attract others to the religion; _and, as to_ the origin and means of attraction, the attraction is this, that he himself maintains the benedictions of the religion, and the means of attraction are this, that he is an upholder of the commands of the religion.

2\. This, too, that by him who shall perform the ritual of an ordeal which is accomplished, the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> <span id="p372"><sup><small>[ p. 372 ]</small></sup></span> passage [^1] is made known; even for this reason, because those even _who have_ accomplished what is a work of the spirit become witnesses, one about the other, as to the facts. 3. This, too, that by him who shall perform that thing whereby a change occurs from evil to good [^2], even that change which is the renovation _of the universe_ is made known, by means even of the evidence of a partial change as regards a perpetual change.

4\. This, too, that by him who shall produce generosity for the tillers [^3] of the world it is then developed; even for this reason, because they become more diligent _in_ tilling the world. 5. This, too, that by him who shall produce benefit for the poor, a development [^4] of the world is produced for them; even for this reason, because through that reason they increase more.

6\. This, too, that the creature-forming (dâmîh) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^5] is occasioned by him whose rule [^6] is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because he becomes a holder and attendant of good works. 7. This, too, that the devastation by Vohûman [^7] is taught _by_ him whose rule is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because he smites sinners _and_ destroys among villains.

8\. This, too, that virtuous people are increased in a province [^8] by him who appoints a virtuous governor of the province. 9. This, too, that virtuous instruction is provided _and_ explained by him who loves Vohûman [^9]. 10. And this, too, that virtuous <span id="p373"><sup><small>[ p. 373 ]</small></sup></span> deeds [^1] are set going by him who teaches learned sayings _and_ virtuous deeds to him who is good; even for this reason, because the reception _of_ the progressive supply of virtue by the learned becomes more complete.

11\. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.
