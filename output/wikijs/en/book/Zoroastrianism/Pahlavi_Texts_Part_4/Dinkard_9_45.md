## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XLV.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The twenty-second fargar<i>d</i>, Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti [^10], is about the perfection of the prayers [^11] of the good religion, and information thereon. <span id="p299"><sup><small>[ p. 299 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. About the glory of a family of some houses _that_ has come to the Spîtâmas [^1], even before the coming of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; the knowledge and habit of organization and priestly authority of those _arising_ from that family; the existence therein of houses, villages, communities, _and_ districts; _its_ attracting _and_ exalting mankind, from vice to virtue, by propriety _of_ words and actions; _and_ it convinces those of the world even till the arrival of the good religion. 3. And this, too, that the existence _of_ Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp—that desire of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^2]—and of Frashô<i>s</i>tar of the Hvôbas [^3], is owing to it.

4\. About the praise of Pôrû<i>k</i>âst [^4], daughter of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, for loving the good religion with wisdom and acting _by_ the advice of the religion, _having_ given _her_self contentedly in womanly service (zanŏîh) to Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^5]; _her_ complete accomplishment <span id="p300"><sup><small>[ p. 300 ]</small></sup></span> of duty and reverence _for_ him, _and_, after Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _her_ also performing womanly service (zanîh) and reverence _for_ <i>G</i>âmâsp [^1]; _likewise_ her great reward from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> for religiousness and self-devotion (khvê<i>s</i>îh) to the sacred beings. 5. About the praise of Hûtôs [^2] for the arising of the progress of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion through her, by the growth of righteousness and smiting _of_ the primeval fiend; _also_ the good works and advantage which have arisen in the world from _her_ great possessions, and her equal praise and grand position here _and in_ yonder _world_.

6\. About the characteristics of those who are preparing the end _of time_ and arranging _its_ period _there_ is this, too, namely: ‘They are a manifestation _of_ those, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! who shall cause this renovation in the existences; they are observant, little afflictive in tormenting, _and_ fully mindful, so that, when milk reaches them, they thoroughly digest _it;_ they _have_ no fear and accoutrements (<i>a</i>fzâr), _nor_ yet do they mention false _and_ irreverent (anâstŏ) statements concerning those who are righteous through imploring righteousness.’ 7. About the characteristics of those disturbing the end _of time and_ opposing _its_ period _there_ is this, too, namely: ‘They are a manifestation _of_ those, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! who are destroying the existences [^3]; they are swiftly remedied, that is, they become very quickly devoured (khâî<i>d</i>ŏ) and _are_ in <span id="p301"><sup><small>[ p. 301 ]</small></sup></span> the torment of the vicious _and_ grievous abode; they are not fully mindful, so that _it_ is not possible for them to digest milk, their fear is inevitable (a<i>k</i>âr), _and_ they mention even false _and_ irreverent statements concerning those who are righteous through imploring righteousness.’

8\. About the craving for the fiend, the assistance of the fiend, and the gratification of the fiend _by_ him who is an apostle of the demons, and his rendering the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> helpless [^1] even through the want of progress (anas<i>a</i><i>k</i>isnŏ) which they lament; also the confusion owing to his speaking deceitfully in the world, _and_ the connection with him of an awful and swift death [^2], and the most grievous _and_ hellish punishment. 9. About that wicked follower and assistant of theirs _in_ defeating righteousness, and also in destroying the greater religiousness (frêh-dênôîh) _of_ the world and making the soul wicked in the end.

10\. About the occurrence of the dissipation of the glory of him who is a well-ruling man, and the pacification (âsû<i>d</i>anŏ) of the creatures of the world by the sacred beings, it says this, too, namely: ‘The persuader _to_ evil [^3] and the organizer of distress (veshi<i>s</i>nŏ)—where they shall make pain _and_ distress current in the world—are the weakener (nerefsînî<i>d</i>âr) and corrupter (âlâyî<i>d</i>âr) for the <span id="p302"><sup><small>[ p. 302 ]</small></sup></span> righteous; it is the ruler that is righteous who smites them and opposes them—that is, restrains them from sin—and causes hatred for them through _his_ will [^1]; that, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! is this dominion of thine _by_ which you give benefits (vehî<i>g</i>ânŏ) _to_ him who is justly living _and_ poor [^2].’

11\. It is perfect excellence _that is_ righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^10]: (298:10) See Chap. XXII, 1 n.

[^11]: (298:11) See Pahl. Yas. LII, 1 a.

[^1]: (299:1) The family from which Zaratû<i>s</i>t, Maî<i>d</i>ôk-mâh, and Pôrû<i>k</i>âst were descended. Its name originated with Spitâma, an ancestor of Zaratû<i>s</i>t nine generations back. Compare Chap. XXXIX, 23.

[^2]: (299:2) Perhaps we ought to read ‘the Spîtâma Zaratû<i>s</i>t,’ substituting Spîtâmak for kâmak, ‘desire,’ which latter word is written on a patch by the repairer of the MS. who must have found the original word defective. See Pahl. Yas. LII, 2 C.

[^3]: (299:3) See Chap. XXI, 24.

[^4]: (299:4) See Pahl. Yas. LII, 3 a. Av. Pouru<i>k</i>ista who became the wife of <i>G</i>âmâsp, prime minister of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.

[^5]: (299:5) Ibid. 4 a. It seems unlikely that zanŏîh means ‘marriage’ here (the term being applied to her relation both to Zaratû<i>s</i>t and <i>G</i>âmâsp), unless we were to suppose that she married <i>G</i>âmâsp after her father's death, which the phrase akha<i>r</i> min Zaratû<i>s</i>t, ‘after Zaratû<i>s</i>t,’ might possibly imply. And if zanŏîh means merely ‘womanly service’ here, its Zvâri<i>s</i> equivalent nêsmanîh, applied to the seven sisters of Ar<i>d</i>â Vîrâf in AV. II, 10, may also not imply marriage, which is a view already suggested in S.B.E., vol. xviii, p. 398 n.

[^1]: (300:1) See Pahl. Yas. LII, 4 b.

[^2]: (300:2) Ibid. 5 a. Av. Hutaosa, the wife of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, see Yt. IX, 26, XV, 35.

[^3]: (300:3) See Pahl. Yas. LII, 6 e.

[^1]: (301:1) Or it may be ‘maintaining the affliction of the creatures,’ if we read <i>â</i><i>z</i>ârdârîh instead of a<i>k</i>ârgârîh.

[^2]: (301:2) See Pahl. Yas. LII, 8 d.

[^3]: (301:3) Ibid. 9 a. B has avêhîh vêrenakînî<i>d</i>âr, but avêhîh, ‘want of goodness,’ ought to be dû<i>s</i>îh, ‘evil,’ which it resembles even more in appearance than in meaning, in Pahlavi letters.

[^1]: (302:1) See Pahl. Yas. LII, 9 c.

[^2]: (302:2) Ibid. 9 d. Compare Chap. XLVII, I q.
