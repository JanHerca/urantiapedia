## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER II.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. Glorification for the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion _which is_ the ordinance of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> opposed to the demons.

2\. Of the Sû<i>d</i>kar [^1] there are twenty-two fargar<i>d</i>s, <span id="p173"><sup><small>[ p. 173 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ the first fargar<i>d</i> is the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^2], just as the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô _formula_ is as _it were_ the beginning (bûnîh) of the religion, and from it is the formation of the Nasks which, though about the first six sciences (dâni<i>s</i>nŏ), _have_ also demonstrated the existence of the highest of other sciences in its own place.

3\. And here it speaks about the power and success owing to uttering the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô _formula_ [^3] at the beginning of actions. 4. One _utterance_ when _one_ wishes to say anything to _any_ one; one when he wishes to beg of _any_ one; _and_ one when he goes to work. 5. Two when he wishes to confer his blessing. 6. Four when _it is_ for the homage of the chiefs _of creation_ (ra<i>d</i>ŏ-franâmi<i>s</i>nîh), _or_ the ceremony of a season-festival. 7. Five when _it is_ for carrying off the fiend. 8. Six when _it is_ for power; _and_ six when _it is_ for the success _of_ a battle. 9. Seven when _it is_ for the ceremonial of <span id="p174"><sup><small>[ p. 174 ]</small></sup></span> the archangels, _or_ when _one_ wishes to perform the ceremonial of the archangels. 10. Eight when _it_ is for the ceremonial of a guardian spirit of the righteous. 11. Nine when _one_ wishes to cast seed into his land. 12. Ten when _one_ wishes to allow procreation. 13. Eleven when _one_ goes to ask for a wife. 14. Twelve when _one_ expects to go up on a mountain. 15. Thirteen when _one_ wishes to go to an inhabited district (rû<i>d</i>astâk-1); twelve [^4] when he goes out pathless; _and_ one [^5] when he wishes to proceed by a ford _through_ the water.

16\. About _the place_ where _one has_ to utter the first Yathâ-ahû-vairyô for smiting the demons. 17. About the good results (dahi<i>s</i>nân) _of_ a suitable recital _of_ the words _of_ the Ahunavair, the summary _of_ everything for Zaratû<i>s</i>t to utter. 18. And about _the fact that_, through chanting forth every single word of the Ahunavair with a virtuous intention, a demon is disabled, and _there is_ protection of person _and_ property from the adversary.

19\. About the division of the twenty-one Nasks, likewise, according to the first, second, and third lines (gâs) of the Ahunavair [^6]. 20. About the increase of the creatures owing to the liberal thought, word, and deed of a righteous _person; owing to_ the priests _having_ become numerous, and the reverence _of_ him who is making them numerous, and _owing to_ the perpetual meditation of righteousness and the existence of its recompense.

21\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (172:4) The first of the Nasks and second of the Gâthic division (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 9, 12). As the Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t (the first of the Gâthic p. 173 division, but the last of the general list of Nasks) contained the text of the Gâthas, so the next three of the Gâthic division contained commentaries, or homilies, upon that text, written with different objects in view. The purpose of the Sû<i>d</i>kar was apparently (as its name imports) to extract useful instruction from the text, and to illustrate it with legends and remarks. A separate fargar<i>d</i> is devoted to each hâ of the Gâthas, beginning with the three sacred formulas, and including the united Yasna Haptanghâiti and the Aîryaman. The connection between the commentary and text, though usually traceable, is not always very clear; but that is a common characteristic of homilies in general.

[^2]: (173:1) The Ahunavair (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7). This fargar<i>d</i> explains the use made of this formula, and the benefits derived from it.

[^3]: (173:2) As a spell, or appeal for success. The text of §§ 4-15 has been independently handed down by tradition, with a few variations, in Sls. XIX and the Persian Rivâyat of Bahman Pûn<i>g</i>yah.

[^4]: (174:1) Sls. XIX, 14 has ‘thirteen.’

[^5]: (174:2) So in both MSS., but ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/17400.jpg) ayô<i>v</i>, ‘or,’ is more probable than ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/17401.jpg) aêvakŏ, ‘and one.’

[^6]: (174:3) See Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7.
