## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXI.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The twentieth fargar<i>d</i>, Vohû-khshathrem [^1], is about the oppressive actions of the sovereignty which Dahâk [^2] exercised over the earth of seven _regions_, and the forward progress of his commands owing to a surrounding of terrors.

2\. About Dahâk's enquiry of the members of the assembly, regarding the reason of the affliction of the collected people, after the cutting _up_ of Yim [^3] and the accession (khû<i>d</i>âyih) of Dahâk; and the people's saying, _in_ reply to Dahâk, that Yim had kept away want and destitution, hunger and thirst, decay and death, lamentation and weeping from the world, _besides_ the cold and heat of the immoderate mingling of the demon with mankind. 3. And this, too, that [^4] ‘a giver of comfort was Yim—that is, those things _were_ produced by him which are the comfort of mankind—and he was a giver of desire for them, so that his happiness _was_ through the gratification produced—that is, mankind gratified him through virtue. 4. And Aû<i>d</i>ak [^5], who made <span id="p213"><sup><small>[ p. 213 ]</small></sup></span> Yim the splendid _and_ rich in flocks—who _was_ struck down by you through violent assault—unauthorisedly desirous (varak [^6]) and eager for the world, produced want and destitution, distress and greed, hunger and thirst, and the sanctifier [^7] of Wrath the wounding assailant, Want without pastures, Terror, Destruction the secret-moving, Decay the decrepit [^8], and the seven _arch-_demons [^9].’ 5. And this, too, that ‘those who look _for_ a son _are_ made devoid of pregnancy by thee; evil-destined is the monster (<i>s</i>îpist) self-made, the uncompleted demon that it is impossible to seek a remedy for, who does not extend (lâ vâlê<i>d</i>) from _himself_, that is, no lineage proceeds from him. 6. And thou _art_ a sheep that is a wide-traveller, _and_ keeps the dog _away_ from mankind; thou _hast_ snatched away from us the bright radiance of Yim the splendid _and_ rich in flocks, who came out on every evil contingency, at the approach of <span id="p214"><sup><small>[ p. 214 ]</small></sup></span> every winter, _or_ scorched by extreme heat, so as to act for the benefit of his place [^10]. 7. Thou art intelligent, O Bêvarâsp [^11]! do thou even tell how this opinion is so, that a bad ruler is a thing which is so bad; he who is a good ruler is our desire, we _will_ give the revenue _of_ taxation (bâhar-i madam-dedrûni<i>s</i>nîh) to him, and anything which is necessary _for_ good government when he shall achieve _it_.’

8\. About the smiting _by_ Frê<i>d</i>ûn [^12], for the sake of killing Dahâk; the striking of _his_ club upon the nape of the neck [^13] (pilîk), the heart, and even the skull; and Dahâk's not dying from that beating. 9. Then smiting _him_ with a sword, and the formation (va<i>s</i>tanŏ) of noxious creatures of many kinds, from the body of Dahâk, at the first, second, and third blow. 10. The exclamation of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Frê<i>d</i>ûn thus: ‘Thou shouldst not cut him who is Dahâk, because, if thou shouldst cut him, Dahâk would be making this earth full of serpents, toads (khan-galâk), scorpions, lizards, tortoises, and frogs;’ with the mode _of_ binding _him_ with awful fetters, in the most grievous punishment of confinement [^14].

11\. This, too, _that_ when <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk was bound, the report of the same proceeded thus through all the regions, which are seven, that down-stricken is <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk, but he _who_ smote _him_ is Frê<i>d</i>ûn the Âspîkân [^15], the exalted _and_ mighty. 12. And _in_ the <span id="p215"><sup><small>[ p. 215 ]</small></sup></span> tenth winter those particulars _were_ believed, and thus they spoke, that _it was_ owing to [^16] Yim that <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk is now smitten by them, because the tidings which are good are not yet gathered unto all the regions, which are seven, and those which are evil do not mention <i>A</i><i>z</i>, nor demand the virtuous maiden (<i>k</i>arâtîk) with importunity, nor even coveted wealth [^17]. 13. This, too, that, when information came to him of women, _or_ property, that seemed to him desirable to possess, _they were_ then admitted by him into a golden cage [^18], and that, which was completely impregnable (aîrî<i>s</i>tŏ), came on through immaterial space (maînôg-dîvâkîh) to the den (grêstakŏ) of <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk.

14\. This, too, that, though [^19] he who smote him _were_ his brother, or descendant, or kinsman, or any one whatever _of his_ nearest relations, it did not seem to them as that which is grievous, and _it was_ not thought _of_ in their minds, so that it did not occasion them even a reminiscence again; and thus they talked, that _if_ a householder _be_ he _that_ smote, _he is one_ for whom all the fires of the religion are suitable, _but_ that householder _being_ a monarch, he _that_ smote is _one_ who is every way their ruler. 15. This, <span id="p216"><sup><small>[ p. 216 ]</small></sup></span> too, that _at_ every place where he came on, _and_ upon which _his_ horse's hoofs (safô) fell, the dense fire from them _was_ for the protection of the horse's body. 16. This, too, that through his confused (gûm<i>ê</i><i>z</i>akŏ) practising _of_ good deeds _arose_ even the evil deeds of <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk.

17\. About those of the Mâzendarân [^20] country _having_ consulted, after the smiting of Dahâk, as to turning (gâ<i>s</i>tanŏ) to Khvanîras [^21], and driving out Frê<i>d</i>ûn therefrom, _and_ as to the residence offered _by_ the same place through the great number fallen; also, on account of their tallness, there are _parts_ of the wide-formed ocean [^22] that come up to _their_ mid-thigh, there are _others_ that _are_ up to the navel, and the deeper places _are_ up to the mouth. 18. And, when they have come to this region, _their_ producing grievous harm and destruction _to_ the poor [^23], and the coming of the people with complaints to Frê<i>d</i>ûn, and _their_ speaking thus: ‘Why didst thou smite <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk, who was a good ruler as to prerogative, so that danger _was_ kept away by him, and an inquisitor (vi<i>g</i>ôyî<i>d</i>âr) from him protected this region from those of the Mâzendarân country?’ 19. And they also said this, about the vileness of the Mâzendarâns, and the wretched state of the people of this region as regards them, that is, they then speak thus: ‘Since their habits are thus, since they <span id="p217"><sup><small>[ p. 217 ]</small></sup></span> are filthy (dô<i>s</i>\-hômônd)—that is, dirt (karak) is theirs—possessing holes [^24] (sûlak-hômônd)—that is, holes are theirs—_and_ having appellations (ka_rî_tuni<i>s</i>nŏ-hômônd)—that is, they call to one another—we men (vîr) think, _and_ consider upon this, that they also are human beings.’

20\. About the encountering of Frê<i>d</i>ûn with those of the Mâzendarân country on the plain of Pê<i>s</i>ânîgas [^25], and disputing with them thus: ‘You are of the Mâzendar country, _and_ I (anmanŏ) _have_ destroyed <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk by the swiftest ruin, _him_ who was a grievous sovereign of every one, demons _and_ men; for that smiting of him I am produced _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> more overpowering than his limbs made paralyzed by his own enmity, and then you destroy this country of mine, you who are of the Mâzendar country.’

21\. And the Mâzendarâns thought slightingly (s<i>a</i>pûkŏ) of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, _and_ spoke in a tone of derision thus: ‘Should it be so, that thou destroyedst <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk by the swiftest ruin, _him_ who was a good sovereign of both demons and men, and thou art produced _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, for that smiting of him, more overpowering than his limbs, even then we _will_ settle in this _place_ and _will_ stay in this _place_; and _it is_ not thou that _art_ exalted, who _art_ an overgrown (kabed-ârôyi<i>s</i>nŏ) huge sheep with the speech of a hero among other people, _and_ we would not admit thee here.’

22\. This, too, that ‘nevertheless _they_ afterwards fled, and the victorious Frê<i>d</i>ûn pursued _them_ to the <span id="p218"><sup><small>[ p. 218 ]</small></sup></span> foremost upland, and his nostrils flamed _upon_ it so that _they_ split it through; from his right nostril is the cutting _and_ sharp scorching of the ice _that_ has fallen _and_ of all the cold of winter; and from his left nostril is the cutting _and_ sharp scorching of the rock _that_ has fallen, which is similarly burning to a fire the size of a house, carrying the dust from the feet of the male ox, Barmâyûn [^26], of the obstructed victor, the mighty Frê<i>d</i>ûn. 23. And he made it rush up on the ascent, whereby they are made figures of stone, and they who _are_ of the Mâzendar country are destroyed by him through the smiting of fifties, the smiting of hundreds, the smiting of thousands [^27], the smiting of myriads, and the smiting of _multitudes_ innumerable [^28].’

24\. ‘Thus _there_ are destroyed by him, the victorious _and_ mighty Frê<i>d</i>ûn, two-thirds _of_ those of the Mâzendar country, and one-third came out beaten and sick; and never afterwards, O Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! have they who _are_ of the Mâzendar country marched upon this region of Khvanîras, and _it has_ not _been_ imagined by them, even in thinking about _it_, that they [^29] should go _there_, except those [^30] whose names were thus, S<i>p</i>îtîyô<i>s</i>, _son_ of S<i>p</i>ânsnâyô<i>s</i> [^31], and Arezrâs<i>p</i>âh, _son_ of S<i>p</i>ânsnâyô<i>s</i> [^32], who have wandered (ta<i>g</i>\-î<i>d</i>ŏ) <span id="p219"><sup><small>[ p. 219 ]</small></sup></span> in search of wisdom and have proceeded unto Frashô<i>s</i>tar [^33] of the Hvôbas [^34].’

25\. Perfect excellence is righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (212:1) The first two words of the fourth Gâtha (Yas. LI, 1), here written vohûk-khshatar (B) and vôhûk-khshatar (K) in Pahlavi.

[^2]: (212:2) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 8.

[^3]: (212:3) As mentioned in Yt. XIX, 46; Bd. XVII, 5 (‘when Yim was cut up by them the fire Frôbak saves the glory of Yim from the hand of Dahâk’) and XXXI, 5. Regarding Yim see Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 6-8.

[^4]: (212:4) What follows, as far as the end of § 7, appears to be quoted verbatim from the original Pahlavi text of the Nask.

[^5]: (212:5) The demon Uda who tries to make people talk when they ought to be silent (Bd. XXVIII, 19), and who seems to be identified p. 213 (in Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 70) with the fiend who confesses her amours to Srôsh, and is said (in Bd. XXXI, 6) to have been the mother of Dahâk, there named Udaî or Aû<i>d</i>, but more commonly called Va<i>d</i>ak (see Chap. X, 3; Dd. LXXII, 5, LXXVIII, 2), whence possibly the matronymic Va<i>d</i>akân (Mkh. LVII, 25, the Av. vadhaghana of Vend. XIX, 6) of that monarch. The text here appears to allude to an amour with Yim.

[^6]: (213:1) Av. vara; or it may be a miswriting of var<i>d</i>ak, ‘astray’ (Av. vareta).

[^7]: (213:2) Pahl. a<i>î</i><i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n-hômônd, ‘one holding ceremonies,’ alluding to Dahâk himself as the progeny of Aû<i>d</i>ak.

[^8]: (213:3) These five demons are Aeshm, Nîy<i>â</i><i>z</i>, Saham, S<i>ê</i><i>g</i>, and Zarmân in Pahlavi, who, with the exception of Saham, ‘terror,’ are described in Bd. XXVIII, 15-17, 23, 26.

[^9]: (213:4) The seven _arch-_demons are the six mentioned in Bd. I, 27. XXVIII, 7-13, XXX, 29, whose Avesta names are Akem-manô, I<i>n</i>dra, Sauru, N<i>a</i>unghaithya, Tauru, and Zairi<i>k</i>a (see Vend. X, 9, 10, XIX, 43), together with either Mithaokhta or Angramainyu himself (see Bd. I, 24).

[^10]: (214:1) K has only ‘who came out at every place to act for _its_ benefit.’

[^11]: (214:2) ‘With a myriad of horses,’ a title of Dahâk.

[^12]: (214:3) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 8, 9.

[^13]: (214:4) Or, perhaps, ‘the reins.’

[^14]: (214:5) In Mount Dimâvand (see Chap. XV, 2 n).

[^15]: (214:6) Av. Âthwyâna, a patronymic derived from Âthwya who, p. 215 according to Yas. IX, 7, was the father of Thraêtaona (Frê<i>d</i>ûn); but Bd. XXXI, 4, 7, 8, XXXII, 1 n, make it a family name for many preceding generations.

[^16]: (215:1) Or min may mean ‘_apart_ from.’

[^17]: (215:2) Demands often made by Dahâk, as stated in § 13.

[^18]: (215:3) Pahl. sûlak-hômand, ‘_something_ having apertures;’ compare the sûlâk-hômand which translates Av. sufrãm and suwraya in Vend. II, 7, 18, 30, and has sometimes been understood as a ‘signet-ring.’ Also compare § 19 below.

[^19]: (215:4) Assuming that mûn, ‘who,’ stands for amat, as in Chap. XIII, 2.

[^20]: (216:1) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 9.

[^21]: (216:2) See Bk. VIII, Chap. VIII, 2. Mâzendarân was considered to be outside of Khvanîras because it is separated from Irân by lofty mountains.

[^22]: (216:3) The Caspian is probably meant here, being considered a portion of the circumambient ocean.

[^23]: (216:4) K omits ‘_to_ the poor.’

[^24]: (217:1) Burrows, caves, and similar underground habitations are probably meant.

[^25]: (217:2) See Chap. XVI, 17.

[^26]: (218:1) This appears to have also been the name of a brother of Frê<i>d</i>ûn (see Bd. XXXI, 8).

[^27]: (218:2) B omits ‘the smiting of thousands.’

[^28]: (218:3) Compare Yt. V, 54, 58, 117; Pahl. Vend. VII, 137, 139.

[^29]: (218:4) Literally ‘we.’

[^30]: (218:5) K has ‘the two.’

[^31]: (218:6) These first two names are only in K, because B repeats here a previous phrase by mistake. The second name is written Sânsnâyô<i>s</i> here, but is spelt correctly on its next occurrence.

[^32]: (218:7) These two sons of S<i>p</i>ânsnâyô<i>s</i> were the spiritual chiefs, or p. 219 supreme high-priests, of the two northern regions, Fra<i>d</i>adafsh and Vîda<i>d</i>afsh. They are named Spîtôî<i>d</i>\-î Aûspôsînân and Aêr<i>ê</i><i>z</i>râsp-î Aûspôsînân in Bd. XXIX, 1; and the statement that they came from Mâzendarân, made in the text here, identifies that country with the two northern regions. The names of these two high-priests are evidently derived from the Avesta genitives Spitôi<i>s</i> Uspãsnao<i>s</i> and Erezrâspahê Uspãsnao<i>s</i> in Yt. XIII, 121, persons concerning whom it is only stated that their fravashis, or guardian spirits, are to be reverenced.

[^33]: (219:1) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 68.

[^34]: (219:2) Av. Hvôva, the family name of Frashô<i>s</i>tar, <i>G</i>âmâsp, and several other ancient personages (see Bk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 25).
