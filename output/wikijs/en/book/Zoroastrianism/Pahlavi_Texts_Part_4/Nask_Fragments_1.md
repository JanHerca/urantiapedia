## EXTANT FRAGMENTS [^1]. I. SÛ<i>D</i>KAR NASK [^2].

Dk. IX, Chap. II, 3-15, referring to the useful effect of reciting the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô as a spell, on various occasions, is quoted in Sls. XIX, 1-14, and also in the Persian Rivâyat of Bahman Pûn<i>g</i>yah [^3], with some slight variations.

Dk. IX, Chap. VI, 2, refers to the passage thus mentioned in Sls. IX, 2, 3:—‘The priest who passes away in an out-district (aûzdehîkîh) thou hast considered as desolate (vîrân); and there is a high-priest who is of a different opinion, there is _one_ who says _it is as_ a non-Irânian (anâîrân) country. _It is_ declared that, when a supreme high-priest (zaratû<i>s</i>trotûm) passes away in an out-district, an apostate will be born in that dwelling, and this calamity is only (aêvâ<i>k</i>) mentioned as to the supreme high-priest [^4].’

Dk. IX, Chap. VIII, 1-6, refers to Zaratû<i>s</i>t's <span id="p452"><sup><small>[ p. 452 ]</small></sup></span> prophetic vision of the golden, silver, steel, and mingled-iron periods of his millennium, quoted at length in Byt. I, 1-5, with variations indicative of the date of the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t being later than that of this Nask.

Dk. IX, Chap. X, 3, refers to the detailed account of the seven most heinous evil-doers, quoted in Dd. LX XII, 3-9,

Dk. IX, Chap. XV, refers to the supplication of the soul of Keresâsp for admittance into heaven, on account of his heroic deeds, quoted at length in the Dâ<i>d</i>istân Pahlavi Rivâyat and the Persian Sad-darband-i Hûsh (see S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 373-381).

Dk. IX, Chap. XVIII, 2, refers to the passage thus quoted in Sls. X, 8:—‘For in the Stû<i>d</i>gar it is said, concerning those who _have_ unlawfully slaughtered animals, the punishment is such that _each_ hair _of_ those animals becomes like a sharp dagger (têkh), and he who is unlawfully a slaughterer is slain.’

No allusion has been noticed in Dk. IX to another passage which is thus quoted in Sls. XII, 32: ‘In the Stûdgar it says thus: “What prepares sneezing? that is, through what process (kâr) does it come?” And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "Hungry living, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! moreover, the remedy for its existence is the Ahunavair, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _and_ the Ashem (aharâyîh)."’
