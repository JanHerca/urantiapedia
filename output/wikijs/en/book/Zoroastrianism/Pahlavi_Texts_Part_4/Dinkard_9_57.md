## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LVII.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The eleventh fargar<i>d</i>, the Yasna [^1], is _that_ the whole of the good works _which are_ to accomplish, _and_ those, too, which are accomplished [^2], are appropriated _by_ the righteous _man_ who teaches virtue [^3] to the righteous; even for this reason, of the good works which _one_ accomplishes, _and_ those, too, which are accomplished, _there_ is all one store (anbâr), from the work (var’<i>z</i>ŏ) of the original good creation even to the renovation _of the universe, and_ ever afresh the teaching of virtue _by those_ who are righteous comes to the accumulation of the righteous and the accomplishment of that store, _and_ they, too, are in possession of that store, _in_ partnership with the other righteous. 2. This, too, that _it is_ because he would do the best for his own [^4], whose meditation of the liturgy is for those who are archangels, and who also maintains, for the assistance of the good, the strength which is his for the existences. 3. And this statement indicates the great participation of any one in that store, because when that store is really an accumulation of work on the way, for the partners in that store who _have done_ more, and also _those_ who _have_ accomplished less, _and_ remains, moreover, in the possession of them all, then, _as to_ those accomplishing more of it, through the original possession of most of that work, and also through that which _occurs_ when the accomplishers have attained to that plenty more particularly owing to their more labour, and likewise through the property, liberally, <span id="p349"><sup><small>[ p. 349 ]</small></sup></span> largely, and lordlily, of those accomplishing more, and the indigence, unafflictedly [^5], scantily, and subordinately, of those accomplishing less, _it is_ reasonable to speak of that store as in their possession, and _of their_ superiority _as_ greatly over those accomplishing less. 4. This, too, that his work is good work whose liberality is for the archangels; even for this reason, because through a little labour _for_ the sacred beings, which is itself that liberality, he contributes duty and good works.

5\. This, too, that it becomes best for him, in both existences [^6], who teaches a wishing for living in diligence to mankind; even for this reason, because he is a preserver of them through the wishing for living, and _his_ soul, through the diligence owing to him, attains perfection, here from mankind _and in_ yonder _world_ from the sacred beings. 6. This, too, that the ceremonial and obeisance of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^7] are performed by him who is in the way of like thinking and like praising of the law of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> with all the worshippers of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 7. This, too, that he is in the leadership of his religion [^8] who makes the knowledge of religion ever afresh; even for this reason, because every item of knowledge which he provides increases some greatness of it. 8. This, too, that he is in the service of his religion [^8] who demands the knowledge of religion ever afresh; even for this reason, because so long as he demands more, he becomes nearer to a knowledge of religion. <span id="p350"><sup><small>[ p. 350 ]</small></sup></span> 9\. This, too, that mankind's wishing for life is authorised (dastovarînî<i>d</i>ŏ) by him who authorises the production of anything for mankind; even for this reason, because authority (dastôbarîh) over the production of anything is conjoined with that which is for the wishing for life; so that whosever production of anything is authorisedly, their life is _free_ from any discomfort; and whosever wishing for life is authorisedly, his production of anything is also authorisedly. 10. This, too, that acceptance, hints, and words are given [^9] to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by him who asks again, that which he does not understand of the religion, from him who does understand; even for this reason, because knowledge is completed through these three _things:_ obtainment, hints, and speaking, and all three are asked again by him who does not understand. 11. This, too, that the words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^10] are taught by him who teaches the acceptance, remembrance, and speaking _of_ the religion; even for this reason, because this is the recital of that compendium (hanger<i>d</i>îkîh).

12\. This, too, that the care [^11] _and_ reverence of fire are provided by him who is liberal to a fire as regards anything he supplies _for_ the care _and_ reverence which _others_ shall provide _for_ the fire, and he becomes equally rewarded for it. 13. This, too, that by him who teaches the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> with joyfulness [^12], the care _and_ reverence of fire are <span id="p351"><sup><small>[ p. 351 ]</small></sup></span> provided as declared by the religion; even for this reason, because even that _which is_ taught by him combines with the action due to that teaching. 14. This, too, that the obeisance [^13] _to_ those requiring obeisance is arranged _by him_ who loves Vohûman. 15. This, too, that fire is strengthened—for that work, achieved in the future existence, which is the greatest [^14] that exists—by him who invokes fire with the title of fire; even for this reason, because the title is put by him upon a nature that is laudable, and when invoked by him with that title the praised _one_ is then strengthened by him.

16\. This, too, that he becomes informed as to the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^15], who teaches the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> with pleasure; even for this reason, because every knowledge is exercised _and_ increased by teaching. 17. This, too, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is propitiated by the excellent sagacity of him who teaches virtuous words and actions [^16]; even for this reason, because sagacity _has_ two parts, the speakable and the workable. 18. This, too, that the bodily form (kerpŏ) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is praised as perfection (nêvakŏtûmîh) [^17] by him who elevates (bâlistînê<i>d</i>ŏ) his own soul [^18] to the station of the sun [^19]; even for this reason, because that bodily form of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> exists, and becomes the loftiest _and_ most perfect in the station of the sun.

19\. This, too, that all excellence is purely produced for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by him who has root in the <span id="p352"><sup><small>[ p. 352 ]</small></sup></span> possession _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because, when a root is given to him, fruit is also produced by him, and all excellence is _both_ root and fruit [^20]. 20. This, too, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is invoked with the title ‘lord [^21]’ by him whom Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> calls; even for this reason, because the interpretation of ‘Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>’ is really with _the words_ ‘greatly wise lord’ (mas dânâk khû<i>d</i>âî). 21. This, too, that the names of the sacred beings _which are_ invoked [^22] are the praise glorified by _any_ one, and by him who glorifies them they are named; even for this reason, because the names of the sacred beings are the glorification due to their names of praise. 22. This, too, that among those of the same class (ham-gôharân), when he shall do _it_ for one race [^23], benefit is produced by him for other races within that class; among those of the same races (ham-tôkhmakânân), when he shall produce benefit for one species, _it is done_ by him also for other species within that race; and among the same species (ham sarâ<i>d</i>akŏ), when  he shall produce benefit for one individual (kerpŏ), _it is done_ by him for other individuals within that species.

23\. This, too, that his personality (khû<i>d</i>îh) is the sacred beings’ own [^24], who maintains the rites [^25] with the assistance of the righteous. 24. This, too, that his own is in the guardianship [^26] of the sacred beings, whose vehemence is through Good Thought; <span id="p353"><sup><small>[ p. 353 ]</small></sup></span> even for this reason, because his bravery is for the law. 25. This, too, that life is given to mankind by him who shall do that which is able to remain good for them. 26. This, too, that the friendship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is appropriated by him who has Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as a guardian, and perpetual guardianship is appropriated by him who teaches to mankind that thing which becomes their perpetual guardianship _in_ yonder _world_.

27\. This, too, that he causes righteousness [^27] who thinks of anything which is virtuous. 28. This, too, that he has caused the good commands and propitiousness [^28] of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, who gives _his_ body and life [^29] to the sacred beings; and body _and_ life are given to the sacred beings by him who affords friendship to the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 29. And this, too, that to him who affords friendship to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> it occurs owing to the guardianship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and that guardianship is perpetually [^30] connected with him who teaches to others that thing which always constitutes their companionship with the sacred beings.

30\. Excellence _that_ is perfect _is_ righteousness.
