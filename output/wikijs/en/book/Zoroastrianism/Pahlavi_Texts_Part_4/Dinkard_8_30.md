## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XXX.

_Hûspâram Nask_.

1\. One section is the Gôharikistân (‘_quality code_’), particulars about natural superiority; not the modified (ga<i>s</i>takŏ), but the lawful, approved [^2], and specific _state_ of superiority; not acquired by the slender power [^3] of the world, but _by_ seeking virtuous living through causing the prosperity _of_ every person; _also_ the authorisation of superiority, _and_ the proportion of advantage therein. 2. About a superiority unimpoverished (anyûrûzd), with _one_ unimpoverished with a nature unspent (an-aûrûzd), with _one_ unspent with an impoverished (nyûrûzd), and _one_ impoverished with an impoverished; also the extent of impoverishment and non-impoverishment, that is, with whom _it is_ not customarily of much <span id="p98"><sup><small>[ p. 98 ]</small></sup></span> consequence (pavan freh-ar’<i>g</i>ŏ), with whom _it is so_ customarily, _and_ with whom, owing to an exception, _it is_ not customarily of much consequence on account of _its_ much consequence for an uninformed _person_, that is, with whom _it is_ as _it were_ proper with a servant of sin. 3. And superiority is a furtherance of living beings, and pervades the natural extent thereof.

4\. About him who would sell property not his own, _and_ him who would buy _it_. 5.. About selling a sheep frequenting the house, _and one_ not frequenting the house. 6. About various precautions _as to_ samples of various things. 7. About selling beasts _of burden_, cattle, slaves, servants, _and_ other property, of the nature of whose species _one is_ aware through speaking about the nature of different species; _and_ the retribution for the sin of whatever is on the same subject. 8. That which is an obvious agreement for selling with defects [^1], when it is declared of beasts _of burden;_ and that which is ever defective on selling.

9\. About a house in which a person, _or_ dog, _has_ passed away through contagious sickness, and the clothing which the man wore owing to that sickness; that is, how it is when spoiled for selling _for_ three _years_, how it is when _it is so for_ two _years, and_ how it is _when it is so for_ one year. to About a house in which a person, or dog, _has_ reposed in a contagious sickness, _and_ not passed _away_ after _his_ descent therefrom; _and_ the clothing which the man wore in that sickness; that is, how it is when spoiled for selling _for_ two _years_, how it is when _it is so for_ one year, and how it is when _it is so for_ thirty nights; _and_ whatever is on the same subject. <span id="p99"><sup><small>[ p. 99 ]</small></sup></span> 11\. About forming a family (gôharik ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>anŏ) with foreigners, that is, how it is when allowable. 12. About a sheep of _good_ breed for the three nights [^1], _and its_ slaughter after the three nights; likewise many other decisions as regards superiority and sheep of a _good_ breed.
