## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XLII.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The nineteenth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i> mâ-yavâ [^2], is about the protection _by_ a protector for the protection _of_ the distressed _ones_ of the renovation _of the universe_ [^3]. 2. About the impossibility of convincing those who have not attained to the fundamental reason (bûn <i>k</i>im) of belief, before making them comprehensibly reliant upon the existence of the creator, which is the fundamental reason of belief.

3\. About the grievous suffering (vîmârîh) of the religion owing to him who is a wicked judge, whose effusions (r<i>ê</i><i>z</i>î<i>d</i>anŏ) on the judgment seat are injudicious, malevolent, _and_ enemies of wisdom; also his wounding is owing to truth [^4], and _his_ annoyance owing to the truthful, and the evil spirit is lodging in him; _likewise_ the advantage _to_ the religion and the great reward of just judges, and the introduction <span id="p290"><sup><small>[ p. 290 ]</small></sup></span> (madam-bari<i>s</i>nîh) of a desire for leadership in virtuousness [^1]. 4. About separation from the friendship of a wicked, ill judging, unintelligent, and idle _person_, in whom wrath and envy are coiled up (<i>a</i><i>v</i>ar<i>p</i><i>ê</i><i>k</i>ŏ) [^2]. 3. About the good government of securers of their own necks (<i>k</i>avarman) from viciousness, and the bad government of those repeatedly culpable (lakhvâr-âhûgân) owing to viciousness. 6. And this, too, that the wicked themselves are wicked to their own and make them fit for hell, even as to those who [^3] are precious to them and more beloved than righteousness; and _their_ reign, too, is a scanty protection (ga<i>s</i>ûkŏ srâyi<i>s</i>nŏ).

7\. About the praise of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _there_ is this, too, namely: ‘Thy sweetness and mildness are shown to the worldly existences, thy leadership of the religion is through Vohûman, _and_ thou art well conversant with righteousness [^4].’ 8. About the praise of Frashô<i>s</i>tar's ardour in the leadership of good works, in virtuousness [^5], listening _to_ instruction, and truthful speaking, and in pasturing (fshegîh), cultivating the world, achieving benefit (sû<i>d</i>ŏ tâshî<i>d</i>ârîh), and not giving leadership to villains [^6]. 9. About the praise also of the energy _and_ high-priestship of <i>G</i>âmâsp [^7]. 10. About the protection of the good <span id="p291"><sup><small>[ p. 291 ]</small></sup></span> creations by Vohûman, _and_ that, too, of the souls of the righteous _by_ Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> also [^1].

11\. About the punishment of the wicked _ruler_ who is seizing anything unlawfully in his realm. 12. Also about the grievous punishment of the wicked, evil-thinking, evil-speaking, evil-doing, heretical (dû<i>s</i>\-dênô), evil ruler in hell [^2]. 13. About the reply of the archangels to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, as to the reward begged by him, to make _him_ satisfied about it [^3].

14\. It is righteousness _that is_ perfect excellence.
