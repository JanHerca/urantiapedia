## Footnotes

[^2]: (152:2) Corresponding to the nineteenth word, drigubyô, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the twentieth Nask in other Rivâyats. In the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> its name is semi-Zvâri<i>s</i>, either Gvî<i>d</i>\-shêdâ-dâ<i>d</i> or Vîk-shêdâ-dâ<i>d</i>, the Av. dâta vîdaêva, ‘law opposed to the demons.’ In the Rivâyats it is called <i>G</i>ud-dêv-dâd, Vendîdâ<i>d</i>, or Vîndâd, and is stated to consist of twenty-two kardah, or fargar<i>d</i>s, the number it still contains. It is generally considered that the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> now extant is a collection of fragments, p. 153 but it is evident, from the close correspondence between the author's description and the present contents, that this fragmentary state of the text existed in his time; and there is every probability that any mutilation that exists in the text occurred before Sasanian times. The author, however, sometimes omits to mention subjects that are repeated, so it is just possible that some of these repetitions are of later date. He also makes no allusion to the twelfth fargar<i>d</i> (see § 51 n).

[^1]: (153:1) Vend. I, 1, 2 (W.).

[^2]: (153:2) Vend. I, 3-20.

[^3]: (153:3) See Chap. XIII, 6-8.

[^4]: (153:4) Vend. II, 1-19.

[^5]: (153:5) Vend. II, 22-43.

[^6]: (153:6) Vend. III, 1-13, 22, 23, 34.

[^7]: (153:7) Vend. III, 14; the latter clause referring to the commentary on Pahl. Vend. III, 48 (Sp.).

[^1]: (154:1) Vend. III, 15-19.

[^2]: (154:2) The person polluted in this manner being considered as unclean as the corpse itself.

[^3]: (154:3) Vend. III, 20, 21 and perhaps some commentary on Pahl. Vend. III, 71 (Sp.) now lost.

[^4]: (154:4) Vend. III, 23-31.

[^5]: (154:5) Vend. III, 32, 33.

[^6]: (154:6) Vend. III, 36-40.

[^7]: (154:7) Vend. III, 41, 42.

[^8]: (154:8) Vend. IV, 1-16.

[^1]: (155:1) Vend. IV, 44.

[^2]: (155:2) Vend. IV, 45.

[^3]: (155:3) Av. Mithrô, the angel of the sun's light, friendly to man, and, hence, insisting upon the fulfilment of every promise (mithrô). He is supposed to keep an account of all breaches of promise (see Dd. XIV, 3), and to mediate between the departed soul and its accusers (see Mkh. II, 118); in doing which he co-operates with the angels of obedience (Srôsh, see Chap. IX, 3 n) and justice (Rashnû, see Chap. XX, 153 n) who estimate and weigh its good works and sins, and decide upon its fate at the bridge of judgment.

[^4]: (155:4) Vend. IV, 46, 50-55.

[^5]: (155:5) See Chap. XXVII, 4 n.

[^6]: (155:6) Vend. V, 1-4.

[^1]: (156:1) Vend. V, 5-7; but the last clause refers to a Pahlavi commentary found only in the manuscripts.

[^2]: (156:2) Vend. V, 8, 9.

[^3]: (156:3) See Chap. XIX, 3.

[^4]: (156:4) Vend. V, 15-20.

[^5]: (156:5) The Vendîdâ<i>d</i> itself, see § 1 n.

[^6]: (156:6) Vend. V, 22-25.

[^7]: (156:7) Vend. V, 27-34.

[^8]: (156:8) Vend. V, 35-38.

[^9]: (156:9) Vend. V, 39-44 (W.), and commentary on Pahl. Vend. V, 134 (Sp.).

[^10]: (156:10) Vend. V, 45-56.

[^1]: (157:1) Av. khshva<i>s</i> m<i>a</i>unghô; Vend. V, 57-59 (W.), and commentary on Pahl. Vend. V, 167 (Sp.).

[^2]: (157:2) Pâz. dhôvana which is here assumed to be equivalent to Pers. dô bun. It is probably a reading of the Pahlavi word ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/15700.jpg) or ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/15701.jpg) in Pahl. Vend. V, 169; 172, which has been variously read as <i>g</i>û<i>g</i>an, ‘a dirham,’ dûkŏ, ‘a spindle,’ or yûkŏ, ‘a rag;’ the last of which would best suit the context here.

[^3]: (157:3) Vend. V, 60-62.

[^4]: (157:4) Vend. VI, 1-9.

[^5]: (157:5) Vend. VI, 26-41.

[^6]: (157:6) Vend. VI, 44-51.

[^1]: (158:1) Vend. VII, 1-5, 10-16. Nothing is said about VII, 6-9, 17-22 (which passages are merely a repetition of V, 27-30, 57-62), but this omission may be owing to the fact that these passages are so abbreviated in the MSS. as to be easily overlooked, especially by a reader of the Pahlavi version only.

[^2]: (158:2) Vend. VII, 23-26.

[^3]: (158:3) Pahl. tanand va-mâk (= mêg), evidently equivalent to the Av. sûnô madhakhay<i>a</i>us<i>k</i>a of Vend. VII, 26, which are rendered by tûn mêgŏ-<i>k</i> in the Pahlavi version. The identity of Av. madhakha with Pahl. madag, or mêg, Pers. maîg, mala‘<i>h</i> ‘a locust,’ has long been recognised (see Darmesteter's Études Iranniennes, II, p. 199). But the meaning of Av. sûn = Pâz. tûn has been merely guessed to be ‘a mosquito;’ the Avesta word having been transcribed as sîn, or sin, in the prose Sad-dar, LXXII, 2, and explained by the Persian gloss pa<i>s</i>ah, ‘a gnat or fly,’ by some copyists, while others have read san (for sin) and have substituted its synonym sâl, ‘a year,’ or have read bî<i>s</i>, ‘a poisonous herb,’ instead of pa<i>s</i>ah. With regard to the word ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/15800.jpg) tanand, ‘spider,’ in our text, it may be observed that it has descended from a much older copy of the Pahlavi Vendîdâ<i>d</i> than any that could have been consulted by the author of the Sad-dar, and it is easy to see how an original Pahl. ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/15801.jpg) could have been read ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/15802.jpg) in Pâzand by later copyists of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i>.

[^4]: (158:4) Vend. VII, 26, 27.

[^5]: (158:5) Vend. VII, 28-35.

[^1]: (159:1) Vend. VII, 36-44.

[^2]: (159:2) Vend. VII, 45-50.

[^3]: (159:3) Vend. VII, 51, 52, 55-59, which refers to tombs and mausoleums (uzdaêza uzdi<i>s</i>ta) and not to the legal dakhmas, or depositories for the dead. §§ 51, 52 are described after the others.

[^10]: (160:10) The Ahunavair formula is so called from its first three words (see Chap. I, 7 n).

[^11]: (160:11) Vend. IX, 45, 46, X, 1-20, XI, 1-20 may probably be all alluded to in these few words; but nothing is said about the twelfth fargar<i>d</i>. This omission is singularly in accordance with the fact p. 161that the same fargar<i>d</i> is omitted in all very old copies of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> with Pahlavi version, in which, although the fargar<i>d</i>s are numbered, the thirteenth immediately follows the eleventh. The Kopenhagen MS. No. 2, in which the twelfth fargar<i>d</i> occurs with a Pahlavi version, is said to be a revision of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> text compiled in the last century, and other copies of the Pahlavi twelfth fargar<i>d</i> have been derived from this revised text. The omission of this fargar<i>d</i> in all the old MSS. cannot be satisfactorily attributed to the loss of some folios in an older copy, because no fargar<i>d</i> is likely to fill exactly a certain number of folios; the loss must also have occurred very shortly after the last revision of the Pahlavi text, to account for the author of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> not finding the Pahlavi of this fargar<i>d</i> in the ninth century.

These rods are tied together by a central girdle, passing three times round them and knotted just like the sacred thread-girdle round the waist of a Parsi; but this girdle is formed of six threadlike ribbons split out of a leaflet of the date-palm and twisted together. The bundle, when properly purified, is laid upon the crescent-shaped tops of two adjacent metal stands, whence it is taken up by the officiating priest, to hold in his left hand during certain recitations.
