## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXIII.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The twenty-second fargar<i>d</i>, Airyaman [^1], is about the meeting of Kaî-Khûsrôî [^2] and Vâê, the long-continuing lord [^3] next to the renovation _of the_ <span id="p224"><sup><small>[ p. 224 ]</small></sup></span> _universe; and_ Kaî-Khûsrôî's asking Vâê, the long-continuing lord, about his smiting so many of the ancients who have been the highest of mankind in splendour and glory. 2. The reply of Vâê, the long-continuing lord, about his smiting them; and, upon that answer, Kaî-Khûsrôî's taking Vâê, the long-continuing lord, and transforming _him_ into the shape of a camel, mounting _him, and_ going, with the Irânian levies (han<i>g</i>amanôîkân), to the place where the immortal Haoi<i>s</i>t, _son_ of Geurva [^4], lies in strength [^5], and his letting him lie; also _his_ going beyond (kâdmon) him to the place where Tûs [^6], the banisher of strife, lay in strength, and his letting him also lie; and his going beyond him to the place where Kaî-<i>A</i>pîvêh [^7] lies, and his letting him also lie. <span id="p225"><sup><small>[ p. 225 ]</small></sup></span> 3\. His proceeding beyond them, and meeting on the road with that beneficial victor Sôshâns [^8], and _being_ asked by that beneficial victor thus: ‘What man art thou who sittest aloft on Vâê, the long-continuing lord, so that thou makest Vâê fly, the long-continuing lord transformed into the shape of a camel?’ 4. The speaking of Kai-Khûsrôî, in reply to Sôshâns, thus: ‘I am Kai-Khûsrôî.’ 5. The extolling of Kai-Khûsrôî, by Sôshâns, as regards his _having_ extirpated the idol-temples on the shore of Lake <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast [^9], and his smiting the wizard Frâsîy<i>â</i><i>v</i> [^10].

6\. The glorifying of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion _by_ Kai-Khûsrôî; the coming of the powerful being Keresâsp [^11], club in hand, advancing towards them at the dwelling of that wizard Ges [^12]; the standing up of Tûs, the banisher of strife, and his calling to Keresâsp for reliance upon the Gâtha lore and _for_ union with them; and the praising of righteousness [^13] _by_ Keresâsp, and his throwing _away_ the arm-breaker.

7\. As to these, too, it says that so those men come together _for_ producing the renovation _of the universe who_ are mentioned in this fargar<i>d</i>, and also in other places, _and_ are all experienced _and_ eminent <span id="p226"><sup><small>[ p. 226 ]</small></sup></span> doers, and all powerful _and_ brave; and they shall produce the renovation through a desire for an existence undecaying, immortal, hungerless, and thirstless for ever _and_ everlasting.

8\. It is perfect excellence _that is_ righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (223:5) The appellation of Yas. LIV which begins with the words â airy<i>e</i>mâ i<i>s</i><i>h</i>yô; it is here written aîrêmanŏ (B) and aîremanŏ (K) in Pahlavi.

[^2]: (223:6) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 14.

[^3]: (223:7) Pahl. vâê-î dêrang-khû<i>d</i>âî = Av. vaya dareghô<i>h</i><i>v</i>adhâta who is mentioned as a good spirit in Ny. I, 1. There are, however, p. 224 two Vâês (see Dd. XXX, 4; Mkh. II, 115), the good Vâê who assists the departed soul, and the bad Vâê who opposes it; the former is closely connected with the angel Râm in Yt. XV, 0, 58, and the latter with Astô-vîdhôtu, the demon of death, in Vend. V, 8, 9; Bd. XXVIII, 35. They appear to be personifications of the upper and lower air, respectively; the former being considered pure through its connection with the sacred beings, and the latter impure through contamination by the demons. Possibly the legend about Vâê in our text may have been suggested by the words vayû-beredubyô and vayôi in Yas. LIII, 6, 7; in which case, this fargar<i>d</i> must be considered, to some extent, as a continuation of the preceding one. According to Dd. XXXVI, 3 Kaî-Khûsrôî was made to pass away by Vâê.

[^4]: (224:1) Compare Av. Yû<i>s</i>ta Gâurvayana of Yt. XIII, 118. But Yôi<i>s</i>ta Fryâna, of Yt. XIII, 120, is one of the immortals mentioned in Byt. II, 1; Dd. XC, 3.

[^5]: (224:2) Reading hang, which can also mean ‘a cave;’ but we can likewise read hûg, ‘spiritual life.’

[^6]: (224:3) Av. Tusa of Yt. V, 53, 58; he is one of the immortals mentioned in Bd. XXIX, 6; Dd. XXXVI, 3.

[^7]: (224:4) Av. Kavi Aipivanghu of Yt. XIII, 132, XIX, 71. He was son of Kaî-Kavâ<i>d</i>, brother of Kâî-Ûs, and great-grandfather of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp's grandfather (see Bd. XXXI, 25, 28, 31, 34).

[^8]: (225:1) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIV, 14.

[^9]: (225:2) Apparently the present Lake Urumiyah (see Bd. XVII, 7, XXII, 2; Mkh. II, 95).

[^10]: (225:3) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 11.

[^11]: (225:4) See Chap. XV.

[^12]: (225:5) Written ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg), but the reading is uncertain; possibly the name may be connected with ‘the Ve<i>s</i>kŏ progeny’ in Chap. XV, 2.

[^13]: (225:6) Reciting the Ashem-vohû formula, as a token of adhesion to the religion.
