## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LXVII.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. _In_ the twenty-first fargar<i>d</i>, Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti [^5], it is proclaimed by the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t, that the ceremonial is performed by him owing to whom our <span id="p382"><sup><small>[ p. 382 ]</small></sup></span> worship is good thinking. 2. This, too, that Vohûman and the liturgy are lodging in the body of him in whose body the religion is lodging; _and so is_ the spirit of goodness, which is peace (pa<i>d</i>mân). 3. This, too, that the good religion is taught in word and deed by him who shall achieve the giving of thought (mîni<i>s</i>n-dahîh) _to_ Vohûman _in_ the ceremonial. 4. This, too, that the archangels become lodging in the body of him who loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because their lodging is in light, purity, and perfume, and the body is illuminated, purified, and perfumed by Vohûman.

5\. This, too, that mankind are made diligent in the performance of good works by him who shall provide gifts for the doers of good works. 6. This, too, that by him who loves the beneficial way [^1], even others are put _in_ the same way _and_ taught. 7. This, too, that he gives his daughter in daughterhood to _his_ fatherhood [^2], who teaches to the daughter reverence towards _her_ father; even for this reason, because she is made steadfast in daughterhood by him. 8. This, too, that the authority of Vohûman is taught by him who keeps the talent which is his for virtue; even for this reason, because from the authority of goodness arise the advantage _and_ freedom from strife of the sciences (hûnarânŏ).

9\. This, too, that a daughter is given to a father for womanly service (nê<i>s</i>manîh [^2]), _and_ so also a wife to another man, by him who teaches reverence, towards father and husband, to the daughter and the other woman; and so, too, _by him_ who instructs <span id="p383"><sup><small>[ p. 383 ]</small></sup></span> the wife of a man in housewifery; because the advantageous womanly service of a woman _for_ a man arises through reverence towards _her_ husband and good training in housewifery. 10. This, too, that even the reverence _of_ a wife towards a husband is produced by him _who_ gives a woman unto a man; because the giver of possession (khû<i>d</i>îh) becomes praiseworthy even by the act of _having_ given that possession.

11\. This, too, that origin and effect (bûn va-bar) are produced for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by him who gives _what_ is necessary unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and teaches perpetual preservation; _what_ is properly necessary _being_ the origin of the preservation _which is_ the effect of _what_ is properly necessary. 12. This, too, that dominion is acquired for the house of him who keeps the door of the house an opening for the wise; the house _being_ the body, _and_ the door of the house _being_ the ear, eye, and mouth.

13\. It is the excellence _of_ righteousness _that is_ perfect.
