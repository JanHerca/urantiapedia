## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XIV.

1\. The Spend [^1] _contains_ particulars about the origin _and_ combination _of_ the material _existence_, guardian spirit, _and_ soul (nisman) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; how the creation of each one _occurred_ in the spiritual _existence_, and _in_ what mode _it was_ produced for the worldly _existence_; how _their_ connection with the parents _arose_, the coming of the parents together, the combination in the mother, and the birth from the mother; _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 2. Also about the arrival of both spirits, the good _one_ for developing, and the evil _one_ for destroying; the victory _of_ the good spirit, and the rearing of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

3\. His attainment on maturity, at thirty years _of age_, to a conference _with_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and the <span id="p32"><sup><small>[ p. 32 ]</small></sup></span> occurrence of seven conferences in ten years. 4. Many marvels, owing to him, are published therein, just as there are _some_ which, collected _and_ selected, are noticed by the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> manuscript [^2].

5\. _In_ seven sections (burînŏ), such as are called Spend, are the seven enquiries, _in_ each instance a single enquiry; _and_ the bestowal of the other Nasks, in these seven enquiries, _was_ through speaking out in each one _of_ the places of conference. 6. About the various enquiries, the period of the sitting _and_ rising _on_ each occasion, the nature of the sitting of the archangels, the coming forward of Zaratû<i>s</i>t to that domestic conclave (handêmânîh), his position _in_ that place, what _there was_ to say to him, _and_ what _there was_ to exhibit to him.

7\. The conferring of the wisdom of omniscience upon Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and _what was_ seen _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t _of_ the past _and_ future, and the perpetual amount of duration therein, through that wisdom [^3]. 8. The existence of that wisdom, _and_ what that is which, after _having_ subsisted in it, is again well recognised; such as, owing to it, are the highest _and_ best of places, heaven and the various grades of position _and_ reward _of_ the righteous, according to their worthiness through the practice of good works; the most downward and worst of places, hell and the place _of_ punishment _of_ the wicked, according to their sin; and, between the two, the place of the ever-stationary, those having equal good works _and_ <span id="p33"><sup><small>[ p. 33 ]</small></sup></span> sin; the <i>K</i>înva<i>d</i> bridge [^4], at which is the account as to good works _and_ sin; and the future existence, in which is the consummation of every one, righteous and wicked, and the preservation of all good creations from every evil occurs.

9\. Information also _as to_ many other things which are marvellous, and _as to_ a summary of the statements of these seven enquiries, which is _derived_ from knowledge of every kind. 10. Likewise, about the communication of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's knowledge of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion to the world, his attracting mankind to the religion, _and_ the ages, after Zaratû<i>s</i>t, until the renovation _of the universe_. 11. _And_ about the nature of the advancement of the people of the period, the separation _of_ centuries and millenniums, _and_ the signs, wonders, and perplexity which are manifested in the world at the end of each millennium in the world.

12\. Also as to the birth _and_ arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar [^5], son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, at the end of the first millennium [^6], and a report of him and his time, _and of_ the many destroyers of the organizers of the period between Zaratû<i>s</i>t's millennium and the coming of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar [^7]. <span id="p34"><sup><small>[ p. 34 ]</small></sup></span> 13. The arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh [^8], son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, at the end of the second millennium; information _about_ him and his time, _and_ the destroyers _of_ the organizers who _were_ within the millennium _of_ Aûshê<i>d</i>ar. 14. The coming and arrival of Sôshâns [^9], son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, at the end of the third millennium, the destroyers _of_ the organizers who _were_ within the millennium of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, the arrival of Sôshâns, _and_ information _about_ Sôshâns and his time. 15. Also, as to the renovation _of the universe_ and the future existence, _it_ is declared _that_ they arise in his time.

16\. Perfect _is_ the excellence _of_ righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (31:2) Corresponding to the thirteenth word, angh<i>e</i>us, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; and it is the thirteenth Nask in all Rivâyats. Spend means ‘beneficent, or bounteous,’ and is written Sfend, or Spentah, in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained sixty kardah, or subdivisions.

[^2]: (32:1) In its seventh book which contains a full account of the birth and much of the life of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, with a narrative of future events, all derived, no doubt, from the Spend Nask. Particulars connected with his birth will also be found in Bk. IX, Chap. XXIV.

[^3]: (32:2) See Byt. II, 5-9.

[^4]: (33:1) Av. <i>k</i>invatô peretu<i>s</i>, the route to the other world (see Bk. IX, Chap. XX, 3).

[^5]: (33:2) Commonly written Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, but it is a corruption of Av. Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-ereta. He is the first of the three posthumous sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, who were expected to restore his religion and make it triumphant by three successive efforts, each preceded by a period of anarchy (see Bd. XXXII, 8, Byt. III 13, 43-50).

[^6]: (33:3) The millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, which, according to the chronology of the Bundahi<i>s</i>, must have ended during the period A.D. 593-635 (see Byt. III, 11 n).

[^7]: (33:4) The occurrence of such an interval between the first millennium and the coming of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar seems inconsistent with the previous p. 34 statement as to his arrival at the end of that millennium, but, from Byt. III, 44, it appears probable that he was expected to come in the 600th year of the next millennium (A.D. 1193-1235).

[^8]: (34:1) Commonly written Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, but it is a corruption of Av. Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-nemangh. He is the second of the expected posthumous sons (see Byt. III, 52, 53).

[^9]: (34:2) Av. Saoshyãs; the last of the posthumous sons, who is expected to complete the triumph of the religion, and prepare for the renovation of the universe (see Bd. XXX, 4, 7, 25, 27, Byt. III, 62).
