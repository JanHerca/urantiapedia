## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XL.

_Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm Nask_.

1\. One section is the Zîyânakistân (‘_code of the injured_’), about _anything_ which is animate—and that _which is_ inanimate—injured through lawfully living, giving, receiving, _or_ delivering back; the duty of protection and care for both kinds; the nourishment, <span id="p137"><sup><small>[ p. 137 ]</small></sup></span> extension, sustentation, stimulation, establishment, consolation, and also gratification of an animate _being; and_ the retribution for sin due to unlawfulness as regards the same matters.

2\. About an example of a damaged gift, _in_ the _case_ when _one_ gives the thing _to_ a poor (ga<i>d</i>âk) person at an appointed time, _and_ when at _one_ unappointed; _and in_ the _case_ when _one_ gives him an increase, where _and_ what is the increase. 3. A decision about a shepherd when they shall bring _him_ back _an animal_ [^1], when damaged, before _its_ subdivision; what he obtains for the damaged _animal_ when not delivered back at the time of subdivision; when the duty about it is dictated by a religious _man_, and when he keeps _it_ in _his own_ possession.

4\. About property which is inanimate, whose subdivisions, each separately, when _one_ keeps _them_ in use [^2], and when in reserve (armê<i>s</i>tô), are greater and less in value; that is, through so much effecting of penance (<i>a</i><i>v</i>âkan<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) worthily, _or_ through so much bringing of interest; and the capital is the same _in_ value, the increase _being_ the growth of dividends.

5\. About the reason why the sin of an injured _person becomes_ innocent through not delivering back a damaged _article_ [^3]; and many opinions, on the same subject, are provided for our benefit.
