## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LXIV.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The eighteenth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>\-mâ-yavâ [^1], is that, through his complete mindfulness [^2], the teaching of mankind in virtue is by him, and they become properly intelligent [^3] through him, whose actions are those which are more daughterly, that is, as reverent unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as a daughter unto a father; even for this reason, because his display of the complete mindfulness which is instinctive (âsnîk) is through action, _and_ that action, acquired (srûtîk) for the thoughts of mankind, is kindled by him and _has_ become properly intelligent. 2. This, too, that proper intelligence of things arises for _one_ completely mindful [^4], even for a daughter to a father, through that complete mindfulness which is instinctive, whereby that lust is excluded which is most violently reverenced by the male (kû<i>s</i>nŏ), and, devoid of that, the reverence is assimilated (ângunîhînî<i>d</i>ŏ) most strongly to one's reverence unto the creator.

3\. This, too, that discrimination of the affairs of the sacred beings through wisdom [^5] is taught by him <span id="p374"><sup><small>[ p. 374 ]</small></sup></span> whose learning is in the affairs _of_ the sacred beings; even for this reason, because discrimination of the affairs of the sacred beings is specially that which is advantageous _in_ the end, and the advantageousness _in_ the end is seen through learning; _and_, apart from that, he who is learned in the affairs of the sacred beings has taught discrimination of the affairs of the sacred beings through his wisdom [^6].

4\. This, too, that the joyfulness in righteousness is taught to Frashô<i>s</i>tar by him—that is, he would make him ardent in the performance of duty and good works [^7]—who _has_ thoroughly expounded Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> _and_ Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> to Frashô<i>s</i>tar [^8], that is, he maintains _him_ as his high-priest. 5. This, too, that he who shall perform good works ever afresh, has taught him to become ardent in duty and good works [^7]. 6. This, too, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> supplies guardianship [^9] to him who gives pleasure to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because a giver of pleasure to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is any one _who is_ a true servant of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _and_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> becomes the guardian of a true servant.

7\. This, too, that they ever amount to a master of all commands [^10] for him who is a benefit _and_ sovereignty for that which arises; even owing to this reason, because, in establishing _and_ arranging that which is an absurd (As kiln) or a virtuous law, the command issued, which is another _and_ further observation of the advantage of the creatures, prepares <span id="p375"><sup><small>[ p. 375 ]</small></sup></span> that which is ever an attainable benefit among the creatures, by means of which, even after symptoms of the life of one's body, it is governed through setting going the usage of that law, and is connected _with_ his mastery of command and _his_ sovereignty. 8. This, too, that Vohûman's _having_ guarded the creature-forming (dâmîh) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^11] is taught _by him_ whose rule is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; on this account, because he whose rule is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> has taught the inclination for (pa<i>d</i>îsâî) _being_ guarded, on this account, because the inclination of the creatures of that ruler for _being_ guarded by the power of goodness, _and_ the creatures being guarded by the power of goodness have published the power of goodness, which is Vohûman, to the multitude.

9\. Here is about the reply to Zaratû<i>s</i>t concerning the wicked, thus: 'Upon arrival in the fiend's abode [^12], through an immature (khâm) death, they are unprivileged, so that every misery is theirs, and _it_ is not possible for them to seek a remedy.'

10\. This, too, that the spirit of reverence comes through invocation to the assistance [^13] of him who is reverent unto the benefiters; even for this reason, because the spirits respond more particularly to that invoker who becomes their worshipper preponderantly (vâs<i>p</i>ûharakânîhâ); and for each one of the spirits there is preponderantly a _form of_ worship, as the spirit of liberality is more particularly worshipped through helpfulness (vi<i>g</i>î<i>d</i>âr-dahi<i>s</i>nîh), the spirit of truth through exact truth (hû-râstîh), the spirit of a promise through true promising (hû-mit<i>r</i>ôîh), <span id="p376"><sup><small>[ p. 376 ]</small></sup></span> and the spirit of sovereignty through good sovereignty; and, even so, the worship of the spirit of reverence consists preponderantly in reverence unto the benefiters. 11. This, too, that he whose rule is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> becomes a supplicant _for_ that which is coveted (î<i>s</i>tŏ) _from_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^14]; even for this reason, because _what_ is wisely begged from the sacred beings _and_ rulers, for rendering one's own self worthy, occurs as a benefit owing to the sacred beings _and_ rulers.

12\. About the reply of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, when asked by him about his own, _his_ confederate [^15], and _his_ serf, thus: ‘He is thine own, he _thy_ confederate, and he _thy_ serf, even when _and_ where _he is_ a righteous offspring who produces the progress of this thy religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, _and_ recites _it_ openly even unto _him_ he knows, who provides the public benedictions, this good practice of thine, that is, he maintains _what is_ provided _by_ thee as benedictions [^16].’

13\. Perfect is the excellence _of_ righteousness.
