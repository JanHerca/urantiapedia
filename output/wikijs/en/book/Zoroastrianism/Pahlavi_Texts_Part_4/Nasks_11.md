## FROM THE DÎN-VI<i>G</i>IRGARD [^1].

In the name and _for_ the propitiation of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> these several commentaries (zand) are published from revelation (dênô).

The names of the twenty-one Nasks.

1\. One is this that is Yathâ, that is, the Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t, _and_ the subdivisions of this Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t are thirty-three. In that Nask are the blessing _and_ propitiation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels, and they are _for_ the utterance of praise. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sends this Nask into the world, which is suitable for every one, _and_ whoever has committed this Nask to memory recites _it_. And to every one who, being-a high-priest, becomes a reciter of both the Avesta and Zand, _and_ shall recite that Nask three times with correctness, the archangels will come near; as to this they know _it_ without doubt.

2\. The second Nask is that _which is_ Ahû, the Stû<i>d</i>gar, _and_ the subdivisions of that Nask are <span id="p439"><sup><small>[ p. 439 ]</small></sup></span> twenty-two. In it are the giving of advice _to_ mankind, the performance of prayer and virtue, the doing of good actions, intercession, producing union among relations, _and_ such-like topics.

3\. The third is Vairyô, the Vahi<i>s</i>t-mânsar, _and_ the subdivisions of this Nask are twenty-two. In this is the topic of those who are becoming without doubt as to the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, causing heedfulness, and thinking about the religion; also the production of the benediction and attributes (s<i>i</i>fât) of the blessedness of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, every action which was declared virtuous before Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and all actions which have to occur after Zaratû<i>s</i>t until the future existence; the benefit of his world, and such-like topics.

4\. The fourth Nask is this _which is_ Athâ, the Bagh, _and_ the subdivisions of that Nask are twenty-one. In this the topic is this which is the purpose of the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, and the ideas which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> caused _to be_ taught unto mankind; the exercise of reverence, heedfulness, adjudication, and justice; the performance of the proper duty of decision, doing good actions (kâr-î khvaîr), closing the way of Aharman into oneself, attaining unto the spiritual _existence_ for oneself, _and_ such as are like _these_.

5\. The fifth Nask is Ratu<i>s</i>, the Dvâzdak-hômâst, _and_ the subdivisions of that Nask are thirty-two. In that Nask are all the topics of the spiritual _existence and_ the heavenly state, virtue and vileness, the material _existence_ of this worldly state, about the sky and about the earth, and everything which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> produced _and which_ exists in the water, fire, and plants; human beings and <span id="p440"><sup><small>[ p. 440 ]</small></sup></span> quadrupeds, grazing animals and birds, and everything which is similarly produced from any (<i>a</i><i>ê</i><i>k</i>) _of them_, and the characteristics of all things. Secondly, that which is the production of the resurrection and future existence, and the coming together and separation _at_ the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> pass; the recompense for the doers of good works and the punishment for sinners occur through the future existence, _and_ such-like topics as _these_ are.

6\. The sixth Nask is Ashâ<i>d</i>, the Nâdûr, _and_ the subdivisions of that are thirty-five. In this Nask are the purposes of the stars (nu<i>g</i>ûm), the zodiac, and the planets, the goodness and evil of each constellation, and the movement of all the planets in the signs of the zodiac (bûr<i>g</i>) and lunar mansions (mahîgân nu<i>g</i>ûm). They have translated _it_ into Arabic and Persian, and the name they have adopted _for_ this book is Bûtâl, _and_ in Persian the name which is appointed for it is Kapâm<i>â</i><i>g</i>ân.

7\. The seventh is this _which is_ <i>K</i>î<i>d</i>, _and_ is the P<i>â</i><i>g</i>am, and its subdivisions are twenty-two. In this P<i>â</i><i>g</i>am Nask is the topic of the slaughtering of quadrupeds _and_ sheep, how _they_ are to be slaughtered, of which among the quadrupeds the command is that it is allowable to eat, and of which kind the eating is not allowable; how _he_ who slaughters shall strike at the time of the expiring of the sheep. The more expenditure (saraf) _one_ makes upon a season-festival, so much the more is the reward; how much it is expedient to bestow upon the Dastûrs, Môbads, and Hêrbads, and upon the unwavering practisers of good works _in_ the good religion; what merit accrues _to_ every one <span id="p441"><sup><small>[ p. 441 ]</small></sup></span> who celebrates a season-festival and consecrates clothing for a soul, _and_ who, _for_ that reason, is in the supreme heaven _in_ the last times; and it is necessary to give clothing to relations _and_ the righteous as a righteous gift, _and_ to exercise mediation on the part of the righteous; the five greater and lesser days of the guardian spirits, and the practice of good works on _these_ ten days is enjoined in this Nask. It is requisite for all people that they shall read this book with good and wise understanding, that all _may_ become aware of its topics.

8\. The eighth Nask is that _which is_ Ha<i>k</i>â, the Ratu<i>s</i>tâîh, _and_ the subdivisions of that Nask _were_ fifty when the accursed Alexander had the Nasks burnt up, _but_ after that, _as_ they sought out this Nask, _only_ thirteen of those subdivisions came to hand, and no _more_ remained of those previously _existing_. In this Nask are the reasons of performing service, giving orders, and remaining at the command of kings and at the command of high-priests and judges; the adornment-preserving [^2] purpose of cities is declared, the command of religion, and things made magnificently (a<i>g</i><i>î</i><i>z</i>îhâ), grazing animals, birds, cattle, and fish; everything which is a production of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _or_ Aharman; all the purposes of all the seas, mountains, and lands; _and matter_ similar _to_ such as are mentioned.

9\. The ninth Nask is this _which is_ Vangh<i>e</i>u<i>s</i>, _and_ is the Bari<i>s</i>; the subdivisions of that Nask were first sixty, _but_ after the accursed Alexander _only_ twelve remained. _As to_ the information in this Nask, just as there is the sovereignty for _those_ <span id="p442"><sup><small>[ p. 442 ]</small></sup></span> who are kings, so _there_ is the usage which it is necessary _for them_ to practise, and the command of the sentence of judges of the religion such as is necessary to be executed; the custody and protection for the world, and making each new city flourishing; also the reasons of people, who are false-speaking, sinners, _and_ such-like, are mentioned in this Nask.

10\. The tenth Nask is that _which is_ Dazdâ, the Ka<i>s</i>srôb, _and_ the subdivisions of that Nask were formerly sixty, _but_ after the accursed Alexander _only_ fifteen subdivisions remained. In that Nask the topic is that which is wisdom and knowledge, the reason of _its_ being brought forth from the mother, and the teaching of wisdom _by_ demonstration, the performance of purification and the speaking of truth; bringing people from vileness unto virtue, and bringing _them_ from defilement and pollution unto purity; greatness and good progeny arise for people near kings, and how the habit of people telling lies, to others and to kings, arises; _and_ such-like as _these_.

11\. The eleventh Nask was Mananghô, the Vî<i>s</i>tâspâ<i>d</i>, _and_ the subdivisions of that Nask were sixty, _but_ after the accursed Alexander _only_ ten remained. In this Nask is the topic of the sovereignty of Gû<i>s</i>tâsp, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân, _having_ brought the religion from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, king Gu<i>s</i>tâsp accepted _it_, and made _it_ current in the world; _and_ such-like as _these_.

12\. The twelfth is <i>S</i><i>h</i>yaothananãm, the Khûst, _and_ the subdivisions of that Nask were first twenty-two, _but_ after the accursed Alexander _only_ six remained. Among those six, which are the first <span id="p443"><sup><small>[ p. 443 ]</small></sup></span> portions (zizp = Ar. <i>g</i>izb), the topics in _one_ portion are the attributes (sifât) of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the understanding _of them;_ also being without doubt about the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the Spîtâmân, all the duty and good works which are prescribed in the religion, _and_ such-like. In the second portion is the reason of service for kings, the truth of the religion, submission _to_ all _its_ commands, and withholding _one's_ hand from evil actions, so that it _has_ become far from mischief. In the third portion is that which is the debt for performers of virtuous position, the advantage _of_ good works, the final release from hell, _and_ such-like. The fourth is the reason of the creation of the world, the practice of agriculture, the cultivation of trees, the date-tree and every fruit-tree; whence arises most strength for people and animals; being under the command of the practisers of good works _and_ the virtuous, and being under the command of the high-priests, _and_ such-like as they are. In the fifth portion all the specimens of mankind are mentioned: _they_ who are of great knowledge, who are kings, judges, and the sages of the religion; in the second specimen are _they_ that _have_ to keep watch _over_ all the cities, and to make the enemy confounded; in the third specimen are these whose object _one_ mentions _in the term_ ‘husbandmen;’ the fourth specimen which _one_ mentions _are_ these who are the greatly-skilled and sitters in the market, grandiloquent to repel loss, giving one-tenth to the high-priest and king, and offering praise on hardened knees, the last reward of which is that _one_ obtains in the spiritual _existence_.

13\. The thirteenth Nask is that which is Angh<i>e</i>u<i>s</i>, <span id="p444"><sup><small>[ p. 444 ]</small></sup></span> the Spend; its subdivisions are sixty which are precious unto people of pedigrees (mâyagân) and _those who_ possess much avidity for virtuous actions and _have_ to proceed _in_ the footsteps (pâî-rapîh) _of_ the great and religious; _also_ accounts of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, who is born from the womb of Dûghd<i>â</i><i>v</i>ŏ, till ten years _of age_. Every Dastûr and Môbad shall recite this Nask in purity, and with ease and the proper words, _for_ several days, and shall obtain every desire of his own, or _any_ wish which he claims on account of (ba<i>r</i>â râî-î) others.

14\. The fourteenth Nask is that _which is_ Mazdâi; the name Zira<i>s</i>t is appointed _for it, and_ the subdivisions of that Nask are twenty-two. In like manner this Nask is sent _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, which is to make manifest to the people what is the purpose _of_ that science through which mankind are born from the womb of a mother, how many individuals among them will die _away_ from the womb, and how many individuals will live; how many persons _and_ people among them become kings, and how many, meanwhile (fîmâ), exercise apostleship, that is, the high-priesthood; how many are the grandest of people, and how many are the meanest _of_ mankind, _and_ in what mode this occurs; from first to last, the time people are born and all those topics are in this Nask.

15\. The fifteenth is Khshathrem<i>k</i>â, _and_ the name of that Nask is Baghân-ya<i>s</i>t, _and_ its subdivisions are seventeen. In it are the topics of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the lord and the archangels, the knowledge of their attributes, and the service _and_ sublimity _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; at what time every Gâh occurs until the future existence, and what duty is <span id="p445"><sup><small>[ p. 445 ]</small></sup></span> performed; offering praise _for_ every benefit _from_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and obtaining benefit from him; the appearance of the archangels, and knowing what is such-and-such an appearance of such-and-such an archangel in the future existence. This Nask used in the service of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels is very excellent.

16\. The sixteenth is Ahurâi, _and_ they have appointed it the name Niyârâm; the subdivisions of that Nask are fifty-four, about the reason of preserving wealth and placing _it_ out, agreement _and_ measure _by_ the cubit _and_ handful; everything the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> has ordained _as_ uncontaminated, release from hell, and how to walk in the path of reverence and worship; what is in the mind of man, and what is everything in the body of man; _and_ such-like as _these that_ are mentioned.

17\. The seventeenth Nask is that which is Â, _and_ the name they have appointed _for_ it is Aspârûm; one mentions sixty-five subdivisions of it, _and_ in this Nask is every religious topic which all persons well understand, and the punishment suffered _by_ sinners, which they receive in _their_ last career; everything which is uncontaminated is allowable, _and what_ is not uncontaminated is not allowable; the stars preside over the destiny of mankind; and such-like as _these_.

18\. The eighteenth Nask is that _which is_ Yim, that _has_ the name Duvâsarôzad appointed _for it_, and the subdivisions of it are likewise sixty-five. In this Nask are the reasons of next-of-kin marriage, forming connections among relations, and such-like as _these_.

19\. The nineteenth Nask is Drigubyô, the name <span id="p446"><sup><small>[ p. 446 ]</small></sup></span> of which is Askâram, _and_ is of fifty-two stanzas (v<i>ê</i><i>k</i>astihâ), _about_ the giving of orders, exercise of authority, and practising wisdom in everything; producing the resurrection, _by_ which every person passed _away_ is made living again, and the malformations of Aharman and the demons are withered away; _and_ such-like.

20\. The twentieth Nask is that _which is_ Dada<i>d</i>, that they call _by_ its name of Vendîdâ<i>d</i>, where the meaning _of_ this is ‘the law against the demons,’ which is of twenty-two fargar<i>d</i>s. The topic _of_ it is what preserves mankind from evil _and_ pollution, and will restrain _them_ from the menstruous, dead matter, pestilence, and running sores. Of all the twenty-one Nasks the Nask of ‘the law against the demons’ has _alone_ remained entire; while several remain scattered by the wickedness (<i>s</i>ûmîh) of the accursed Alexander, this Nask of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> remained in hand, _and_ owing to its elucidation the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship exists now.

21\. The twenty-first Nask is Vâstârem, whose name _one_ calls Hâdôkht, _and its_ fargar<i>d</i>s are said _to be_ thirty. In it are much excellence and many miracles, and the vile Aharman becomes far from every one who recites this Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht, and it makes _him_ extinct, and _the reciter_ comes near _unto_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and becomes purified from sin.

22\. Now, alas! if all these Nasks do not remain, so that _one_ is not able to solemnize _them_, that is for this reason, that the accursed Alexander, the Arûman, took several transcripts—in the Arûman language and characters (hurûfŏ)—of any among those twenty-one Nasks which were _about_ the stars and medicine, and burnt up the other Nasks; and <span id="p447"><sup><small>[ p. 447 ]</small></sup></span> the soul of the accursed Alexander, the Rûman, will remain wretched and burnt in gloomy hell till the resurrection, owing to his own vileness which injured the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

23\. After the villany of Alexander, an assemblage of several high-priests, who were sages of the religion, brought the Avesta of all _of them_ from various places, _and_ made a collection of so much Avesta and Zand _as_ the sacred (ya<i>s</i>tô) Yasna, Vîspera<i>d</i>, Vendîdâ<i>d</i>, Ar<i>d</i>â-fravar<i>d</i>, and other scraps of the Avesta, the Darûn, <i>A</i>f_rî_ngân, and the Commands of the religion; all these _were_ written, and the Bûndahi<i>s</i> book _was_ correctly written; _and_ all such, among them, as _were_ not written, which did not come into the thoughts of the sages, departed, on that account, from the midst of the many topics of revelation.

24\. Just as it is said that _there_ were twenty-one Nasks, there are first, in seven Nasks, the topics of the religion _of_ Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, in the second seven Nasks are the topics of medical practice, _and_ in the third seven Nasks the topics and capabilities of the stars are mentioned.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (438:1) A Rivâyat in Pahlavi writing, but its language is more Persian than Pahlavi; it commences with this account of the Nasks, combining most of the information contained in the four preceding extracts from the Persian Rivâyats. For this text the translator is indebted to a MS. written A.D. 1813 and belonging to Dastûr Hôshangji Jâmâspji of Poona; a previous translation, in Haug's Essays, was from a transliteration of the same text prepared by Haug some 25 years ago.
