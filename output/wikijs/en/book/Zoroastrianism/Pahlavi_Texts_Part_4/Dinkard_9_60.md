## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LX.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The fourteenth fargar<i>d</i>, A<i>d</i>\-fravakhshyâ [^3], is _that_ whatever is instruction is to be listened to [^4] here as much as is possible, _and_ he who is not to be <span id="p365"><sup><small>[ p. 365 ]</small></sup></span> taught is allowed an opportunity _for_ listening by Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

2\. This, too, that by him who would be a causer of procreation for performers of labour, the perfect nature of the performance of the first next-of-kin marriage [^1] is praised; because causing the procreation of performers of labour is the fatherhood of mankind, the proper fatherhood of mankind is through the proper production of progeny, the proper progeny of the producer is through the accomplishment of progeny among his own, according to the disposition of the first creatures, and the accomplishment of progeny among one's own is next-of-kin marriage; and that which _occurs_, when a causer of the procreation of performers of labour praises the fatherhood of mankind, _is that_ next-of-kin marriage is also praised by him. 3. This, too, that by him whose creatures are in virtue, owing to his virtuous nourishment _of_ the creatures, the performance of next-of-kin marriage [^2] is taught, _and_ the virtue is his virtue; even on this account, because, for the sake of keeping the creatures in virtue, he allows (and<i>â</i><i>z</i>ê<i>d</i>ŏ) for the virtuous disposition pertaining to the multitude, _and_ that which is born he produces (dahê<i>d</i>ŏ) as lineage from the next-of-kin marriage pertaining to the multitude.

4\. This, too, that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is in daughterhood [^3] to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is taught by him whose wisdom is through complete mindfulness; even for this reason, <span id="p366"><sup><small>[ p. 366 ]</small></sup></span> because _his_ wisdom _and_ complete mindfulness are within limits which are Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, the wisdom _being_ that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the complete mindfulness that of Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, and the complete mindfulness _being_ the offspring of the wisdom just as Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and, owing to this, the assertion is reasonable that, by him whose complete mindfulness is connected with wisdom, it is taught _that_ Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is in daughterhood to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 5. This, too, that thus the exercise of that daughterhood is taught by him whose righteousness is through complete mindfulness, and whose ceremonial is also through complete mindfulness; that is, he shall perform the ceremonial and other good works fully mindfully.

6\. This, too, that mankind are attracted to religious good deeds by him who shall provide benefit for the people through actions _and_ words; even for this reason, because those actions are religious good deeds, and, when instituted by him, _others_ are also taught by him. 7. This, too, that reverence for Vohûman [^1] is taught by him who shall make that which is contaminated obvious to the eye, so that what is dark _becomes_ light; even for this reason, because the display of the work of Vohûman thereby has also taught the offer of reverence _for_ Vohûman. 8. And this, too, that the ceremonial is taught with complete mindfulness [^2] only _by him_ who teaches words and actions with complete mindfulness.

9\. Perfect righteousness is excellence.
