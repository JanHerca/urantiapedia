## Footnotes

[^1]: (20:4) Corresponding to the eighth word, ha<i>k</i>â, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the ninth Nask in other Rivâyats. Bari<i>s</i>, or Barî<i>s</i>, means ‘splendid, sublime;’ and the Rivâyats state that it contained originally sixty kardah, or subdivisions, of which only twelve were recovered after the time of Alexander.

[^2]: (21:1) Pû<i>s</i>, the demon of misers in Bd. XXVIII, 28.

[^3]: (21:2) These four angels are personifications of Av. vohû manô, ‘good thought,’ spe<i>n</i>ta ârmaiti<i>s</i>, ‘bountiful devotion,’ sraoshô, ‘the obedient one,’ and ashi<i>s</i> vanguhi, ‘good rectitude.’

[^4]: (21:3) These four demoniacal propensities are here mentioned as the opponents of the foregoing four angels. Akômanô and Aeshm, the first and third, are the recognised opponents of Vohûman and Srôsh, respectively (see Bd. XXX, 29). Varenô, the second, is considered a demon (see Bd. XXVIII, 25), and is mentioned in the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, book VI, as opposing the angel Ar<i>d</i> or Aharî<i>s</i>vang (see Dd. XCIV, 2); here he evidently opposes another female angel, Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, while Aharî<i>s</i>vang or Ashi is opposed by her simple negation, Anâhar.

[^5]: (21:4) Av. sraoshya, see Pahl. Vend. XIII, 9.

[^6]: (22:1) Supposing that sûkŏ stands for sûd.

[^7]: (22:2) Reading bêshînî<i>d</i>ârîh which is more probable than the bêsh<i>â</i><i>z</i>înî<i>d</i>ârîh, ‘curativeness,’ of the MS.

[^8]: (22:3) All the details in §§ 5-19 are to be read in connection with ‘the period’ mentioned in § 4.
