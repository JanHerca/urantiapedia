## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LXVI.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. _In_ the twentieth fargar<i>d</i>, Vohû-khshathrem [^1], _it is_ also stated by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân thus: ‘They who are now in sovereignty are privileged, the human being who is a wicked lying tyrant _being_ not now in sovereignty; moreover, thou shouldst cause _some one_ to thoroughly smite (ba<i>r</i>â vânîn-<i>a</i><i>ê</i>) him who is causing deception in the embodied world by lamentation (<i>s</i>îvan), and they cause the preservation of death, ruin, and falsehood because they would cause the preservation of his effects (mamana<i>s</i> var ae bô<i>g</i>înênd).’ 2. And this, too, namely: ‘When the sovereignty should be given by them unto him who is good [^2], _they_ would be preserved through that sovereignty of his; moreover, thou shouldst cause _some one_ to thoroughly smite him who is made deceitful by lamentation, and _so also_ death, ruin, and falsehood.’

3\. This, too, that by him who shall provide complete mindfulness [^3] for his own, righteousness is produced; even for this reason, because, through <span id="p380"><sup><small>[ p. 380 ]</small></sup></span> complete mindfulness, the discerning eye of life, which is righteousness, is enlightened. 4. This, too, that the coveted _thing_ (î<i>s</i>tŏ) which it is expedient for sovereignty to give away [^1] is taught by him who shall provide sovereignty for him who is all-progressive (hamâk-rûbi<i>s</i>nŏ); even for this reason, because the observation, consideration, and action of him who is an all-progressive ruler are about that which is coveted _by_ the multitude and is an advantage for the sovereignty which it is expedient to produce.

5\. This, too, that _what is_ produced by the words of Vohûman [^2] is taught by him who shall perform the ceremonial of the sacred beings with the thoughts of Vohûman; even for this reason, because, the mind _being_ with the thoughts of Vohûman, the tongues of the faithful are habituated (khûkînî<i>d</i>akŏ) in the statements of Vohûman. 6. This, too, that innocence from discontinued (amând) good works is taught by him who remains in virtue; even for this reason, because _they are_ atoned for by him even among important good works.

7\. This, too, that the original causer of goodness is assisted in causing goodness by him whose fundamental gift (bûn dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) among the existences is that he supplies that which it is requisite for him to give; even for this reason, because _in_ a work, upon which one remains with a thousand men, when one _man_ is bringing his own strength to the labour therein, the 999 _other_ men are assisted by him in that work.

8\. This, too, that the way of righteousness [^3] is <span id="p381"><sup><small>[ p. 381 ]</small></sup></span> not concealed, _but_ taught, by him who is a good considerer as to righteousness; even for this reason, because the sap and root of his righteousness are owing to undiverted thought. 9. This, too, that its _being_ unnecessary to provide repletion for those who are cattle [^1] is taught by him who keeps cattle as a controller _for_ benefiters; even for this reason, because they teach and command him.

10\. This, too, that housewifery [^2] _being_ performed is taught by that wife who shall joyfully pay reverence _to her_ husband; even for this reason, because her housewifery is for the satisfaction of the husband, the satisfaction is through her reverence, and the reverence arises through joy. 11. This, too, that to love the religion through knowledge [^3] is taught by him who is peaceful (pa<i>d</i>mânîk) _and_ Vohûmanic _to_ it; even for this reason, because Vohûmanic peacefulness is understood as religion. 12. And this, too, that the gratification of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^4] is caused by him who teaches for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

13\. It is righteousness _that is_ perfect excellence.
