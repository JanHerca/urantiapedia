## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XLII.

_Sakâ<i>d</i>ûm Nask_.

1\. One section, the Varistân (‘_ordeal code_’), _contains_ particulars of that _which_, when it becomes manifest in any one, is indicative as to witchcraft; the bringing of remedies _for_ the person who is rendered sickly by a wizard; the execution of the wizard, what the religious rite is in the legal proceedings, _and_ the _case_ when _there is_ a religious rite in the legal proceedings. 2. About the _case_ when, for want of legal proceedings, he is executed without the religious rite; and what it is when [^1] he dies through his own destruction of some one.

3\. About the accomplishment of an ordeal by which, through the power of the spirit, _there_ arises a manifestation of acquittal _or_ incrimination of those maintaining inconsistencies as to witchcraft, destroying a righteous _man, or_ other concealed instigations of sin [^2]; the time of its performance, and the place of hurtfulness of its continuance. 4. About the place of accomplishment; _in_ what manner is the selection (fragâr<i>d</i>anŏ), limitation, _and_ preparation of the abode _in_ which the ordeal is performed; that which is to be carried forth to that abode, _and_ that of which the carrying thereto is to be avoided; who is to be admitted to that abode, _and_ who is not to be admitted; _and_ that which, when it occurs there, <span id="p145"><sup><small>[ p. 145 ]</small></sup></span> is a disturbance of the work, they separate (van<i>g</i>end) therefrom.

5\. About those belonging to the place of ordeal (varistânîkân) and other officials there, the rites and customs therein, the ceremonial to be celebrated in the abode, _and_ the invocation of the sacred beings for assistance. 6. What is the mode _of_ performing the hot and cold ordeal; how is the leading forth _of_ the accomplishers thereto, and of what Avesta is their uplifted recitation; how is the accomplishment of the hot and cold ordeal, _and_ the manifestation _of_ the acquitted and incriminated thereby; _and_ many statements (gôkân) on the same subject.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (144:1) We should probably read ‘and about the _case_ when,’ supposing that maman stands for madam, the reverse of what occurs in Chap. XLI, 28.

[^2]: (144:2) That is, when there is no evidence of the crime beyond the suspicions, real or assumed, of the accusers.
