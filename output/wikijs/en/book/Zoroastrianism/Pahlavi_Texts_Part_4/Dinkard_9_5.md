## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER V.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The fourth fargar<i>d</i>, Yânîm-manô [^1], is about where a gradual development (dêr-zahî<i>s</i>nîh) _of_ that which is for the future existence is best; and, secondly, that which _occurs_ now when the wisdom, instructed eloquence, diligence, and energetic effort, which are the utilizers of life, are with one, and these five misusers _of it_—greediness, want of energy, indolence, defilement, and illicit intercourse—are not with one. 2. This, too, that these five defects existed in Dahâk [^2], and owing to that, moreover, Frê<i>d</i>ûn [^3] is irritated with _him_, and smites him in revenge for Yim [^4].

3\. About the heinousness of these four vices, which are drunkenness, knavish companionship, apostasy, and selfishness, and the grievous results therefrom. 4. And this, too, that Yim drove away these four vices from the world, and then was able to prepare immortality. 5. About avoidance of him who, through any statement, is producing a thief as an orator (âkhûn), and _of_ acquiescence with a hasty unoratorical statement of a companion. 6. And this, too, that _he_ who propagates very evil commands in the world gives stout-heartedness to the fiend. <span id="p178"><sup><small>[ p. 178 ]</small></sup></span> 7\. About the clamour of a poor distressed _one for_ a perfect remedy, and the repelling derangement (lakhvâr-pafshîri<i>s</i>nîh), unacceptableness, unblessedness, and want of Gâtha lore of the distresser arisen from the clamour of the distressed _one_. 8. About the connection of satisfying distress on true _and_ reasonable complaint, and the reasonable complaining of true complainers, by him who _has_ been an inferior judge, _and_ gradually up to the highest adjudicator who is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

9\. The excellence _of_ righteousness is perfect.
