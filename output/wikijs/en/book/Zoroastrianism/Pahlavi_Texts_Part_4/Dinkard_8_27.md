## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XXVII.

_Ganabâ-sar-ni<i>g</i>a_d _Nask_.

1\. The fourth section is miscellaneous: about a warm bath _being_ in a house of what kind, the position of security of the fireplace, the watchfulness to be upheld there, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 2. About the strength that a horse _has_ to exert for the sake of the earth, and that which is to be exerted in that mode for the sake of fire. 3. About food _and_ other matters which may be prepared with fire, _and_ the security of the fire in like manner. 4. About fire which, even on the road, is _free_ from throwing away, bodily refuse [^1], and dead matter [^2], and _from_ the injury and harm owing thereto; the various safeguards of fire from _being_ given to an infidel (ag-denô) _or_ a child; the distance of the fire from a rivulet [^3]; the penalty for throwing _it_ away, _or_ other sin as regards it; _and_ the <span id="p91"><sup><small>[ p. 91 ]</small></sup></span> proportion of nourishment and preparation for the fire in summer, _and_ also in winter.

5\. About picketing (ba<i>r</i>â ni<i>s</i>âstanŏ) a horse, that is, how _it is_ justifiable when _it is_ in water and dust, how it is _so_ when really in very distressing bodily refuse, and how it is so when even in bodily refuse _that is_ tolerable. 6. About the proportion of nourishment for mankind, fire, and cattle. 7. About receiving a guest, the praise of liberality, and the grandeur of the liberal, the contempt for stinginess, and the want of the wanderer.

8\. About the mode of wearing garments in a dwelling of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, even so far as a bandage of four rags for protection [^4]; the care of them each separately, the wages of the makers _and_ ornamenters of each one, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 9. About _having_ procured a street-keeper (kûgpânŏ) for the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, the business of the street-keeper thereof, _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

10\. About preparing in the summer a store for the winter. 11. About reaping a field of corn, the Avesta [^5] for the first reaping, and _having_ consecrated the first sheaf with the dedication (shnûman) to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the lord. 12. About the union of those of the good religion together, both in removing want and _in_ union even with infidels in that which <span id="p92"><sup><small>[ p. 92 ]</small></sup></span> is not detrimental to the religion, _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 13. About duty as regards the produce of plants _and_ animals; first, suitable eating; _and_ secondly, moderate eating and avoidance of profusion.

14\. About possessions which belong to the nobles, _and_ those which belong to the multitude; _in_ what manner that which belongs to the multitude _has_ to come into the possession of the nobles; _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 15. About the enviousness (zigûrîh) of the beast _of burden_, ox, and sheep, and also _of_ people; that is, in how many of the multitudes, each separately, it is produced; and whatever is on the same subject. 16. And also much other adjudication and information on similar intelligence.

17\. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (90:1) See Chap. XIX, 3.

[^2]: (90:2) Any solid portion of a corpse, or carcase, of a human being, dog, or other animal.

[^3]: (90:3) Which might extinguish it and, thereby, render the person who had charge of the fire grievously sinful.

[^4]: (91:1) Reading vad-i<i>k</i> vand-1-î 4 lôtŏ-î pânakîh, and taking lôtŏ as equivalent to Pers. latah. We might suppose that the phrase meant ‘a belt of the four strings (rû<i>d</i>ŏ) of protection,’ but the number would not correspond to the three times the sacred thread-girdle passes round the waist, nor would the material of rû<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘catgut,’ be appropriate for the girdle.

[^5]: (91:2) The scriptural formula to be recited in its original language.
