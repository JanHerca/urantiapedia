## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XLIV.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. _In_ the twenty-first fargar<i>d</i>, Vohû-khshathrem [^4], it is said by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘I produced, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! the desire _for_ a good ruler [^5];’ and this, too, _is said_, that, when _there is_ a desire _for_ a <span id="p295"><sup><small>[ p. 295 ]</small></sup></span> good ruler suitable for a share of the world, whoever is suitable for a share of the world \[is a development of that character also, owing to the share which is given him, and by him who is himself also developing the character, by giving him a share\] [^1], giving the share is producing a helper (vi<i>g</i>î<i>d</i>âr), production of a helper is a perfect action [^2], and superiority of action is owing to thought _and_ speech.

2\. About _the place_ where the best wealth is the produce of water, earth, and plants; also its best supplication is lamentation for the religion, and the sovereignty is liberality. 3. About favours _being_ begged from the sacred beings, even with words controverting the response of the sacred beings; the favours _for_ the worthy are to be contended _for_ worthily. 4. About the connection of the power of intelligent remembrance and wise discrimination, one with the other. 5. About the attraction of the mercy of the spirit _and_ leadership [^3], together, into the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânô), for observation regarding the good creatures.

6\. About the begging _and_ teaching of that intelligence which is with the increase of good works; also the imperceptible acquirement [^4] of wealth occurs thereby. 7. This, too, that whoever gives himself up, with humility and reverence, to him who is a high-priest of the true religion, is proficient (far’<i>z</i>ânakî-aîtŏ) in the religion [^5]; and the benefit produced by him, for him who is good, is the liberality <span id="p296"><sup><small>[ p. 296 ]</small></sup></span> _which_ is provided for the sacred beings [^1]. 8. About Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _having_ created water, plants, animals [^2], _and_ the law of the primitive religion _for_ the nourishment, arrangement, and succession of the creatures. 9. About the comfort _of_ the spirit _of_ the liturgy of the religion when he who is a man of credible wisdom and superior disposition utters it [^3].

10\. This, too, that the wicked _one_ who does not believe the deception that he teaches to others, which is his through his own spiritual lord, yet, when he teaches multitudes (kabedân), is convinced by it, attains—_as_ the end of that teaching—eminence (pa<i>d</i>gahîh) for bare-faced deceit (barâhnakŏ frad<i>î</i>pîh), public falsehood, and disjointed belief.

11\. And about mankind _being_ bodily prepared also for the future existence by fire and melted ore [^4]; in the worldly _existence_ the acquitted and incriminated, as regards the law, _have_ become thereby manifest [^5], _and_, in the future existence, the torment of the wicked _and_ the gratification of the righteous [^6]. 12. About Vohûman and Ashavahi<i>s</i>t _being_ invoked [^7] for assistance also in danger from the wicked, and about appropriating the best existence through righteousness alone. 13. And this, too, that a happy coming _of_ men to the supreme heaven exists _for_ the righteous, _but_ no [^8] coming of any one from the wicked. <span id="p297"><sup><small>[ p. 297 ]</small></sup></span> 14\. About the enmity of the Kaî [^1] sodomite (vâêpŏ) [^2] Akht, the heretic of the dark existence [^3], to Zaratû<i>s</i>t; and the causing of disturbance (siklinî<i>d</i>anŏ), _by_ him and the wicked of similar kinds to him, among those who _follow_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t is extreme, and the primeval hellish existence is _for_ them [^4]. 15. About the closing of the abode of the Kai and Karap from virtuousness [^5]; _and_ this, too, that they do not develope the worldly _existences_, nor attend to the spirit, but they contract the world _and_ dissipate the spirit [^6].

16\. About the worthiness of the sovereignty _of_ Kai-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^7], on account of great ability and activity, apart even from superintending. 17. About the praise of Frashô<i>s</i>tar [^8] for his _having_ given Hvôbŏ [^9] in marriage to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the praise _of_ Hvôbŏ for her complete reverence _of_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and admonition to Zaratû<i>s</i>t as to making Hvôbŏ privileged for the post of house-mistress [^10]. 18. About the praise of <i>G</i>âmâsp [^11] for begging fortune and _for_ wisdom in appropriating the excellence _of_ the primitive righteousness; _also his_ affection for the sovereignty and _for_ the recitation of revelation, in which _there_ is assistance of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through command of <span id="p298"><sup><small>[ p. 298 ]</small></sup></span> Vohûman [^1]. 19. About the praise of Maî<i>d</i>ôk-mâh [^2] for his accepting _and_ exercising—_and_ on account of his exercising—the upholding and propagation of the religion; _also_ the yelling, united assault, evil food, _and_ other affliction owing to the wicked _in_ the earlier half of the night, which is that which Zaratû<i>s</i>t _had_, for a like reason, to bear; and the reciting of the law of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^3], for the joy of the sacred beings, and his appropriation of the best existence.

20\. About the abounding of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in complete mindfulness of the origin of learning, and _its_ development by him [^4]; both the object and the advantage of knowledge—which is the reigning of Vohûman in the body—_being_ the means _of_ developing the world in righteousness [^5]. 21. About the perfection of the ceremonial [^6] and obeisance of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ the superiority [^7]of his recompense [^8]; _also_ advice to him as to worshipping Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> pre-eminently, and the primeval angels by their own names [^9] according to their greatness.

22\. It is the excellence _of_ righteousness _that is_ perfect.
