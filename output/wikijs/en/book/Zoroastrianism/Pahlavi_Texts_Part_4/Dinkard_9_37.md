## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXXVII.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ‘produced the dawn _and_ noontide (aûsh r<i>ê</i>pis<i>p</i>) [^3]. <i>e</i>. I fashioned sovereignty _and_ the desired complete mindfulness together [^4], _and_ produced, for more advantageous disclosure, a son (be<i>r</i>manar-aê) for a father [^5]; the disclosure that discloses a male and the impregnation of a female, and in that disclosure a son _was_ produced by me for the father, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t!’ <i>f</i>. So the evil spirit observed, and he called upwards from the abyss thus: ‘<i>O</i> beneficent spirit! thou art the creator _of_ all creatures, _but_ I _will_ make all thy creatures old, <i>O</i> beneficent spirit!’

<span id="p271"><sup><small>[ p. 271 ]</small></sup></span>

<i>g</i>. About the religion becoming progressive [^1] in every one, through its renovation _of the universe and its_ future existence, _there_ is this, too, namely: 'This thy religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is the width of the world, _and_ righteousness is the best of religions; this thy religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is the improvement of the world, which is first supplied _by_ righteousness _and_ complete mindfulness in the reason (vârôm) of those who recite this thy revelation (dênô) [^2] of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! this thy good religion is the best which it is possible to provide with righteousness for one's own. <i>h</i>. Thou shouldst proclaim this to kinsmen _and_ confederates, to priests and him who is most active in the country; _as to those_ who will dispute [^3] this thy religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, thou shouldst proclaim this over the earth of seven regions, unto that which is the furthest of houses, villages, communities, and provinces: "Do thou openly curse [^4] these who are heretical _towards_ me, _thou_ united Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, opposed to the demons, which is the ordinance of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^5]!"'

<i>i</i>. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘I _will_ exalt this which is beloved by thee, the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship _of_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, opposed to the demons, which is the ordinance of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. <i>j</i>. If this which is thine had not been further loved by me, the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, that is opposed to the demons _and is_ the ordinance of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, would have lapsed into disaster (vinâsi<i>s</i>nŏ) [^6], so that the profession <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> of the religion _of_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers would be destroyed, that is, the religion would not have become progressive, _and_ no one _would be_ after the benefiters. <i>k</i>. But, owing to that _love_, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers becomes progressive [^1] even then up to the production of the renovation _of the universe_, even then until the perpetual life of the existences, even then till the raising up of the dead, _and_ even then up to the full atonement of the spirits.’

<i>l</i>. About _being_ despised in hell; the wicked are scornful to a wicked _one, and_ to the spirits _apart_ from the wicked; and it is the creator who, even after saving the others from hell, and the three nights stewing in hell [^2], _is_ to cause the preservation of them also—after those three nights—from that misery, and _every one_ attains to happiness. <i>m</i>. This, too, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘How have the ignorant demons, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! ever been good rulers [^3]? How do they think of them in the world thus, _that_ their happiness arose from them?’ <i>n</i>. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘They have been demons, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _and_ evil-ruling; not well-ruling, even for a reward, do they produce the work of righteousness [^4].’

<i>o</i>. Perfect righteousness is excellence.
