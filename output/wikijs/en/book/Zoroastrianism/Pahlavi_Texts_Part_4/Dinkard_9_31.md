## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXXI.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The eighth fargar<i>d</i>, Tâ-v<i>e</i>\-urvâtâ [^1], is about advice as to reciting [^2] the revelation, the information therefrom for the faithful, about which _they have_ to report to the unfaithful, by mentioning conspicuous specimens _and_ explanatory knowledge, and _by_ thinking _of_ anything whatever which _they have_ to accept, _or_ even which _they have_ not to accept [^3]; _also_, for _one_ called _to_ the religion, the advantage owing to the attraction of mankind to the numerous actual disciple-hood of the religion, and the increasing greatness materially, and further reward spiritually, owing to the numerous disciplehood; and the progress of the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> even among the irreligious (adênôân) [^4] and actual apostates [^5].

2\. This, too, that the life of the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and also all other benefit are owing to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^6] and the inclination (kâmvar<i>i</i><i>k</i>akŏ) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thereto; moreover, reward and recompense come from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 3. And the creatures of Aharman proceed from Aharman, all misery is owing to Aharman, and Aharman becomes worse and more oppressive and a further producer of misery when they worship him. <span id="p246"><sup><small>[ p. 246 ]</small></sup></span> 4\. About the continuance and arranging of both spirits as to their own creations (stî) and the self-acting of their own appliances; the achievement of each one through his own natural resources and through the trifling (ga<i>d</i>agânîk) operation of the other; the spiritual lordship and priestly authority, true confession _and_ the progress of the good religion, _being from_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _and_, through enmity _to_ the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, Aharman is contesting these. 5. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, for setting aside that contester, is the producer of true intelligence, _and_ gave language and also the ritual of ordeal [^7]; the invocation of the sacred beings [^8] for assistance, and the arrival of an angel for the assistance of the invokers; the overcoming of their affliction, the production of their immunity and even righteousness, and also _of_ that good ruler [^9] who is a reminder of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the restoration of bodies, _which is_ the hope of all good creations, _are_ through the sacred beings being invoked for assistance and _their_ arrival where the diffusion [^10] is that of virtuous knowledge through Vohûman [^11], the good religion which is whatever _may be_ the knowledge [^12] _of_ all those who are, _and_ were, _and_ will be.

6\. About the shouting of the demon Aresh [^13] to <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> Zaratû<i>s</i>t and the reply of Zaratû<i>s</i>t as to the advice of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and whatever is on the same subject, just as revelation (dênô) states it, that the demon Aresh spoke to him thus: ‘Then the Franâmam [^14], <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! is _applicable_ to the assembly of demons who sit in the same place three nights and four days on account of thee.’ 7. Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of him thus: ‘<i>O</i> Aresh, _thou_ most deceitful to me! what recompense _would_ there be for it _to_ me, if I _should_ worship you in words?’ 8. And Aresh, the most deceitful of demons, spoke to him thus: 'Thou _wouldst_ become predominant among mankind, through producing at will among the existences just as is requisite for thyself; and thou _wouldst_ become immortal, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! 9. Zaratû<i>s</i>t also enquired of him thus: ‘<i>O</i> Aresh, most deceitful of demons! _as to_ the people by whom you are worshipped, whether for the birth of a son, _or_ even for a concubine sought for enjoyment, so that _the favour_ is considered by them as your property, how can any one of them be immortal?’ 10. And Aresh, the most deceitful of demons, _could_ not tell him who _had_ the more intelligence. 11. So Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘I am _for_ that _being_ and I like him, that is, I am his <span id="p248"><sup><small>[ p. 248 ]</small></sup></span> own and would transact his affairs, and I _will_ recite the law and the benedictions of the sagacious Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the gratifier of desires.’

12\. About the deliverance of all creatures through the liturgy [^15], and, so long as _it is_ continued by them, it is for the power through which the immortality of the separate creations is prepared in the renovation _of the universe;_ the increase _of_ the good creatures through the complete continuance _of_ the liturgy, _and_ the existence of purity and development of goodness in the world when he who is a good ruler arrives.

13\. The arising of the spiritual creation, the first thought of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; _and, as to_ the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, first the spiritual achievement, and then the material formation and the mingling of spirit with matter; \[the advancement of the creatures thereby, through his wisdom _and_ the righteousness of Vohûman being lodged [^16] in the creatures,\] and all good creatures being goaded (zakhamî-hastanŏ) thereby into purity and joyfulness. 14. This, too, that a complete understanding of things arises through Vohûman having made a home in _one's_ reason (vârôm).

15\. About the great reward of him who shall produce benefit for cattle [^17]; also the deceitfully and seductively assuming of religion and colouring of thought, talking of righteousness and adopting evil practices, through the recitation of righteousness even hypocritically (davânsîhâ-<i>k</i>); _and_ an instance _of_ the reward of an undutiful (avar’<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>âr) <span id="p249"><sup><small>[ p. 249 ]</small></sup></span> apostate [^18]. 16. About the work of the creator; _and_, for the completion thereof, the most eminent is understood _to be_ when the world _and_ religion _were_ formed [^19] by him, when life _was_ given by him to those possessing bodies [^20], and [^21] he provides instruction and employment [^22] for it, and when spiritual life (hûkŏ) [^23] _was_ given by him to the wishful _man_, so that he may more _fully_ appropriate a share of the worldly and spiritual _existences_.

17\. _He_ who makes complete mindfulness [^24] lodge in _his_ body consults complete mindfulness, and [^25], through the much investigation of _his_ spiritual life (ahvô) and mind into the attraction of both spirits—_that_ which is good and also _that_ which is evil—each separately for its own appliances, and _into_ the duties of the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is explaining the inefficiency of mankind, as regards the dissipation of their sin, because Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is aware of all they practise, that which is public and that, too, which is concealed [^26]. 18. The great reward of him who is liberal of gifts (dâsar) from his own property to a <span id="p250"><sup><small>[ p. 250 ]</small></sup></span> righteous man [^27], and this, too, that whoever gives him who is wicked [^28] a gift, for the sake of improper expectations, assists darkness and not light.

19\. This, too, that the worst ruler is he of evil religion _and_ evil deeds, who even for a bribe [^29] would not occasion happiness; he who is a destroyer of an innocent _man;_ also the grievous state of punishment _of_ that person, in hell, who shall make that wicked _one_ a ruler [^30]. 20. And advice to mankind as to providing a judge and guardian over every dwelling, the probation of a man for appointment _to_ that important duty, _and_ the development of all creations _in_ the world when its ruler is sagacious [^31].

21\. Also causing the disturbance (va-<i>s</i>iklinî<i>d</i>anŏ) of the evil spirit for satisfying a man who is rightly thinking, rightly speaking, _and_ rightly acting; the opposition _to_ a righteous _man of_ a wicked _one belonging_ to the evil spirit, who is an evil-reciting _and_ improperly-disputing apostate; the enticement (lûsinî<i>d</i>anŏ) of mankind to devious _ways_ (âvârîhâ), _by_ an apostate, _being_ more than that which attracts to the true way for a righteous _man_; and afterwards also, in the end, the defeat _of_ the army of the fiend _by him_ who is beneficial _to_ mankind. 22. Advice to mankind about abstaining from the suite of him who is an apostate, not hearing and not solemnizing the Avesta and Zand of the sacred beings from him [^32]; also the evil behaviour (dû<i>s</i>\-bari<i>s</i>nîh), slander, strife, death, and fear in the world owing to apostates [^33]. 23. Advice to upholders of the religion about the means of thoroughly understanding apostates, <span id="p251"><sup><small>[ p. 251 ]</small></sup></span> and preparing _and_ keeping a weapon for them [^34], so that he who is authorised _and_ fearless _may be_ more eager for truthful speaking; _and_, when the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is liked by him, his truthful speaking and other righteousness have then allured (kâmakînî<i>d</i>ŏ) [^35].

24\. Also _what_ happens in the three _nights_ [^36], for the assistance and preservation of the righteous, through _what is_ accomplished _by_ the propitious fire [^37]; and the progress of his lamentation who deceives and vexes a righteous man [^38], _and_ is leading the wicked _by_ their own befitting deeds to hell [^39]. 25. This, too, that the complete worthiness which _exists_ in Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> _and_ Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^40] arises _in_ him who maintains the prerogative which is his [^41] through virtuousness, who must become such a friend of whatever is his own spirit, through _his_ actions [^42], as the creator is _of_ his own creatures. 26. This, too, that whatever is thus in the world is perfect, when every one thinks, speaks, _and_ shall act just like his spiritual lord _and_ high-priest [^43]; so that a good ruler is he with whom virtuous speaking arises, as well as proper action [^44]. 27. _And_ this, too, that the lodgment of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in the worldly _existence_ is most in the person of that ruler [^45], and that lodgment in him is manifest.

28\. The excellence _of_ righteousness is perfect.

[^2]: (245:2) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 1 a.

[^3]: (245:3) B omits these last eight words

[^4]: (245:4) K has akdênôân, ‘infidels.’

[^5]: (245:5) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 1 c.

[^10]: (246:4) K has ‘ceremonial.’

[^11]: (246:5) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 5 b.

[^12]: (246:6) K has hû-dânâkîh, ‘sagacity.’

[^13]: (246:7) The demon of envy, as in Chap. XXX, 4. The occurrence of his dialogue with Zaratû<i>s</i>t in this place explains the word ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) which is found twice in Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 5 b, and has been read hû-vârîh, ‘good judgment,’ or hû-vaharîh, ‘good fortune.’ In the MSS. called Pt4 and Mf4, in Geldner's edition of the Avesta, this Pahlavi word is both times separated into two thus: ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) which may be read avŏ Aresh, ‘to Aresh,’ and the whole p. 247 § 5 b may be translated as follows:—‘The gift of understanding through Good Thought is that _which_ thou shouldst give unto me (that is, that wisdom thou shouldst proclaim to me as virtuousness), which is _to_ me (through what _pertains_ to it) that which is for Aresh (that is, through that wisdom which is virtuousness it shall become possible for me to give a reply to Aresh).’ The reply here mentioned appears to be that given in § 11 of our text; and the name Aresh explains the word ereshi in the original Avesta text as meaning ‘envy’ and being equivalent to araska.

[^14]: (247:1) The Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper's profession of faith, beginning with the word Av. fravarânê (Yas. I, 23) = Pahl. franâmam.

[^15]: (248:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 6 b.

[^16]: (248:2) Ibid. 6 c. The passage in brackets occurs only in K.

[^18]: (249:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 10 c.

[^19]: (249:2) Ibid. 11 a.

[^20]: (249:3) Ibid. 11 b.

[^21]: (249:4) So originally in B, but altered into ‘when,’ by the repairer of the MS., so as to agree with K.

[^22]: (249:5) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 11 C.

[^23]: (249:6) B has kâmak, ‘desire,’ with ‘the wishful’ in the plural, and this might agree better with Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 11 c, but not with the next clause in the sentence here, where both nominative and verb are in the singular.

[^24]: (249:7) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 12 c. This term is the Pahl. equivalent of Av. ârmaiti which is usually personified as the female archangel Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>.

[^25]: (249:8) The MS. K is left unfinished at this point, merely adding the words expressed by ‘into the attraction of,’ in this translation. For the remainder of Bk. IX the only known MS. authority is B.

[^26]: (249:9) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 13 a.

[^27]: (250:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 14 b.

[^28]: (250:2) Ibid. 14 c.
