## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXV.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The second fargar<i>d</i>, Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^2], is about the worthiness, as to worldly and spiritual virtue, in a ruler and _in_ the production of a high-priest's <span id="p232"><sup><small>[ p. 232 ]</small></sup></span> efficiency; _and_ they _have_ been suitable for leadership and priestly authority with whom _there is_ an existence of it; _also_ other talent through which sovereignty and priestly authority are appropriated, and _which_ the ruler or high-priest himself possesses.

2\. ‘My wish (dôsh), O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! is _that_ thou _be_ in spiritual lordship and priestly authority, because thou art, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! provided with a spiritual lord _and_ possessing priestly instruction—that is, they consider thee, too, as high-priest—_and_ it is because thine is the accomplishment of rites, that thou art quite preserved when _there is_ an encounter of the demons with thee—that is, a dispute of apostates with thee.’ 3. It is non-possession of a ruler and high-priest, _or_ non-possession of a ruler [^1], _that_ became the nature and law of the demons; and the maintenance of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _and_ the archangels, as ruler and high-priest, and the dominion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _are_ combined with beneficence.

4\. This, too, that through righteousness a priestly instructor (ra<i>d</i>ŏ) is a ruler at will, a sage and benefactor, a cherisher and cleanser (âsnî<i>d</i>âr) of the poor; also the fitness for the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânîkîh) of all those who are accepting the religion which _proceeds_ from Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

5\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect.
