## II. FROM THE RIVÂYAT OF KÂMAH BAHRAH [^1].

1\. The name of the first of these books is Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t [^2], and this is a book of thirty-three compilations (ʓûrat), that is, of thirty-three subdivisions (kardah). The sending down of this book _was_ for the description of the Lord [^3] and his angels; _and_ he made _it_ an indispensable duty for the whole world that they learn this book by heart, and for this purpose they form an assembly. Of this total of twenty-one Nasks it is one Nask of the Avesta, and in that mode they recite this.

2\. The name of the second is Stûdgar [^4], and this is of twenty-two subdivisions, which God, the praiseworthy <span id="p420"><sup><small>[ p. 420 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ exalted, sent down for prayer and virtue, authority and intercession, and giving union to kindred.

3\. The name of the third is Vahi<i>s</i>t-mânthrah [^5], and that is of twenty-two subdivisions, which God, the praiseworthy _and_ exalted, sent down for faith and heedfulness in religion. _One_ is reminded, in this book, about the intention and character of Zaratu<i>s</i>t; also the goodness of the creation, and the good actions before Zaratu<i>s</i>t; and the narrative of this book extends in this manner up to the resurrection.

4\. The name of the fourth is Bagh [^6]; this book is of twenty-one parts (pârah) _or_ subdivisions, and its explanation is about whatever is in the religion; also a declaration of God, the praiseworthy _and_ exalted, and _of_ whatever the Lord _has_ made incumbent on mankind as to devotion and heedfulness, as to justice and virtue, _and_ as to good actions, closing the path of Satan to oneself, _and_ approaching the last abode, that is, the other world.

5\. The name of the fifth is Dvâzdah-hâmâst [^7], and the commentary of this book is for assistance [^8]. This book is of thirty-two subdivisions, which God, the praiseworthy _and_ exalted, sent down in remembrance of the beginning of the creatures of the upper world and lower world. Also a description of the whole of them, and _of_ whatever the Most Just, the praiseworthy and exalted, _has_ made mention in the <span id="p421"><sup><small>[ p. 421 ]</small></sup></span> sky and the earth, water, plants, and fire, mankind and quadrupeds, grazing animals and birds, and whatever is created for the advantage and equipment of them. And like this, moreover, the resurrection, that is, the raising of the dead, _their_ path, assembling, and dispersion, and the nature _and_ circumstances of the resurrection, as to good doers and evildoers, through the gravity of every action which they perform as good _or_ bad.

6\. The name of the sixth is Nâdar [^9], and that is of thirty-five compilations which are sent down about the stars and the aspect and life of the sky. Also a description of the constellations, which are auspicious and which inauspicious, the method of these sciences and the operation of each one; whatever they say in sublime words, and whatever remains in this. They separate this from a book whose name in Arabic is Bavaf<i>t</i>âl [^10] and is about the knowledge of the stars; and in Persian the name of that book is Favâmî<i>g</i>asân [^11], and they have made much more mention of the meaning of that, and of instruction of this kind for the moderns.

7\. The name of the seventh is Pâ<i>g</i>am [^12], and this is a book of twenty-two subdivisions, which God, the praiseworthy _and_ exalted, sent down about quadrupeds _and_ how it is necessary to render _them_ <span id="p422"><sup><small>[ p. 422 ]</small></sup></span> lawful, which is lawful and which unlawful, _and_ how they slaughter _them;_ which it is and how it is necessary to slaughter _it_ for the sake of a season-festival, and whatever is about a season-festival; how it is necessary to celebrate _it_, and the person who takes the things [^13]; the expense of a season-festival and how much the reward is; how it is necessary to give to the priests, controllers (radân), and high-priests, and to any persons who are without doubts, who in speech, action, and intention are virtuous, and any persons who recite the season-festival _liturgy_. And everything wise is in this book; and this is incumbent on all people that they learn this, and _it is_ the same for all till the days of the guardian spirits; and every one who possesses knowledge seeks for this, and causes intercession by mankind, for the sake of the worthy, such as clothing _for_ a righteous gift, so that _one_ obtains recompense in the end from heaven; and it is necessary to give this clothing _for_ a righteous gift to relations and the worthy.

8\. The name of the eighth is Ratu<i>s</i>tâyî [^14], and this is of fifty subdivisions, _but_ when, after _the time of_ Alexander, they held an enquiry, they found no more _than_ thirteen subdivisions. And these are about the affairs of the king and obedience, judges and whatever becomes important in holding enquiries, philosophers and devotees; about the edifices of cities, constructed and made magnificent, birds and species of animals, fish _and_ whatever is <span id="p423"><sup><small>[ p. 423 ]</small></sup></span> Ormazd's, the fowls of Ormazd besides the creatures of Aharman; likewise mountains, rivers, and land, and the like of these.

9\. The name of the ninth is Bari<i>s</i> [^15], _and_ this is a book of sixty subdivisions, _but_ after _the time of_ Alexander they found again no more _than_ twelve subdivisions. And these are about descriptions of kings and judges, and an investigation of their authority and their sufficiency; also the relations of a peasant with peasants, of a king with the kingdom, of judges with a judge, and whatever remains therein. Any actions that are for every nation, how they are ordered, and the option as to their species and nature; also whatever the people know, and the advantage _that_ arises therefrom; besides the sins of people, deceit, telling lies, and whatever remains therein.

10\. The name of the tenth is Ka<i>s</i>kasîrah [^16], and this is a book of sixty subdivisions, _but_ after the calamity of Alexander they found again no _more than_ fifteen. Its explanation is about the distinction (faʓl) of natural wisdom and knowledge [^17] from acquired knowledge, that is, the knowledge born from the mother, and the knowledge and instruction they learn; _one_ learned in purity and truthful speaking, and anything that _has_ brought mankind with virtue out of evil, and with purity out of defilement, and this keeps the doctrine praised _and_ great, and whoever is in the vicinity of a king, and is a peasant, becomes greater _in_ honour and dignity; and, in like manner, any things from which advantage <span id="p424"><sup><small>[ p. 424 ]</small></sup></span> arises for mankind; and, _as to_ those who tell lies, how it occurs in the vicinity of kings and peasants.

11\. The eleventh is the Vi<i>s</i>tâsp-shâh [^18], and that is of sixty compilations, _but_ after the calamity of Alexander they found again no _more than_ ten subdivisions. It is about Gu<i>s</i>tâsp's acceptance of the sovereignty, and as to the religion of Zaratu<i>s</i>t—who _was_ skilful in reciting the religion, and maintaining _it_ and making _it_ current in the world—he chose the religion of Zaratu<i>s</i>t.

12\. The name of the twelfth is ‘<i>H</i>a<i>s</i>t [^19], and this is of twenty-two subdivisions, which are sent down in six portions (<i>g</i>uzû). The first is about knowing the Lord, may he be honoured and glorified! and faith on account of Zaratu<i>s</i>t. The second portion is about the obedience of kings, the truth of the religion, complying _with_ commands and resisting them, and restraining _one's_ hand from bad actions. The third portion is about the promise _to_ benefactors and their recompense, evildoers and punishment, and escaping hell. The fourth portion is about the mansions of the world, agriculture, trimming trees, such as the date tree, and whatever remains thereof; the trouble and power of mankind and quadrupeds therefrom, and the obedience they exercise; they are the people to whom heedfulness is attributed, and whatever remains thereof; and the high-priests perform _their_ duty by the law of the religion. The fifth portion is about the ranks of mankind, and <span id="p425"><sup><small>[ p. 425 ]</small></sup></span> those are four ranks: the first is to maintain the king grandly, and, next, the judges and the learned in religion; the second rank is to keep watch _over_ the cities, and to annihilate the enemy; of the third rank are writers and, secondarily, cultivators and the society of cities; of the fourth rank are the people of trade, artizans, market-dealers, and tax-gatherers, in war they appear excited, and it is requisite to give a tithe _to_ the high-priests and king; they keep on foot the obeisances and good works of which we have spoken, and, when they act thus, they obtain great rewards in the end [^20].

13\. The name of the thirteenth is Sfend [^21], and that is of sixty subdivisions which are sent down for the information of people who are in want of it, and for the knowledge of those persons who become covetous of virtuous actions, and act after the proceedings of the learned and people of religion, and receive advantage therefrom; also as reminders that there is advantage from the daily practice of them. And this book is our reminder about the accounts of the apostle Zaratu<i>s</i>t by religious people, and whatever is the allotment of God, the exalted; about the false speaking of the people of the world, and about the goodness of the condition of the people of the world. Also whatever becomes manifest in ten years, about the miracles of Zaratu<i>s</i>t, by the seven reports that they recite.

14\. The name of the fourteenth is <i>G</i>ira<i>s</i>t [^22], and this is of twenty-two subdivisions sent down for the <span id="p426"><sup><small>[ p. 426 ]</small></sup></span> understanding of the causes of mankind, which _have_ made people manifest in the mother's womb, and afterwards those who come out of the womb, some of whom are apostles, some kings, and some peasants; and whatever remains therein.

15\. The name of the fifteenth is Bagh an-ya<i>s</i>t [^23], _and_ it is of seventeen subdivisions in praise of the creations of God, the praiseworthy _and_ exalted, and the angels admitted to him; also thanksgiving _for_ his favours, and that which he makes expedient in the religion, augments the thanksgiving _for_ his favour, until _one_ obtains _it_ back in the end; likewise the appearance of the angels, and this is noble. Praise be to the sacred being, the exalted!

16\. The name of the sixteenth is Niyâram [^24], and that is of fifty-four subdivisions, about decrees _as to_ riches, introducing inmates among outsiders, and whatever is made lawful by the exalted Lord; obtaining deliverance from hell, performing service, slavery, and the nature of wayfarers, and every one who performs service and produces remembrance for mankind; whatever is in the thoughts of mankind, and whatever is in the bodies of mankind.

17\. The seventeenth is Aspâram [^25], and this is of sixty-four subdivisions which are sent down about rituals, those which are in the book of the people of the religion, and an examination of the people's expense they know of, for the safety and punishment they order in the world until they obtain deliverance in the end; and whatever they do lawfully and do unlawfully they know; also decrees <span id="p427"><sup><small>[ p. 427 ]</small></sup></span> _as to_ inheritances and the limits of faith, about anything which they sow and whatever they grow, _and_ about regulating nativity; whatever _one_ makes incumbent on memory, and whatever _one_ makes incumbent on memoranda prepared; also how it is necessary to produce whatever tokens _there are_ at the time of childbirth.

18\. The name of the eighteenth is Duvâsarôni<i>g</i>ad [^26], _and_ it is of sixty-five subdivisions; robbers of human beings and quadrupeds, whatever _one_ makes incumbent that they shall give, and an enumeration of what _one_ makes incumbent on each one of them, owing to theft and terror, obstructing the roads, the dread of the wayfarers, and the disturbance of prisons; _and_ whatever remains therein.

19\. The name of the nineteenth is Askâram [^27], _and_ it is of fifty-two subdivisions, about judges and philosophers, the method of examining decrees, the knowledge of definitions, and am opinion of those in other matters.

20\. The name of the twentieth is Vendîdâd [^28], _and_ that is of twenty-two subdivisions, for causing the abstinence of mankind from bad actions, from the devil and disgrace, foreign magicians and those who act after their proceedings and become committers of crime; and we are told of their crime among the whole of the goodness and purity, and the whole of the wickedness and defilement, and the explanation of them. <span id="p428"><sup><small>[ p. 428 ]</small></sup></span> 21\. The name of the twenty-first is Hâdokht [^29], and this is a book of thirty subdivisions, about the manner of bringing together and the abundance of miracles, also the excellence and connections of them. And the accursed devil goes far from every one who recites this book together with the Ya<i>s</i>t [^30], and this person is near _to_ the rank (pâîgâh) of a sacred being, and his sins become pure; also in this book the accursed devil becomes cursed, and God knows _it_.
