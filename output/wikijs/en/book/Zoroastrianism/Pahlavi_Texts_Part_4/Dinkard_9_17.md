## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XVII.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The sixteenth fargar<i>d</i>, Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû [^2], is about effecting the bridge_\-judgment_ of sinners, as declared by revelation. 2. About performing the ceremony (ya<i>s</i>tô) for a man and a woman, and it is ordered _for_ the woman before the man; the fitness for the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânîkîh) arisen through the liturgy (ya<i>s</i>tô) to be recited itself, or _through_ purchasing _heaven in_ the worldly _existence_ [^3].

3\. About the immunity of the soul from hell through the righteousness _of having_ respectfully given a horse of a _good_ race, the land of a cultivated field, _or_ a virtuous woman, to a righteous man; and also the woman who gives herself in marriage to <span id="p205"><sup><small>[ p. 205 ]</small></sup></span> the righteous man; and that liberal good work increases _from_ time _to_ time [^1], and _from_ day _to_ day.

4\. About the bridge _penalty_ of him who is a mourner (navînî<i>d</i>âr) and _self-_wounder in the three nights _after a death, and_ how _it is_ as though _they_ who are living _should_ again pour melted ore on a human being. 5. About the punishment for a woman who gives herself in marriage to a righteous man, _and_ comes away [^2] from him; such as when a hedgehog [^3] should be constantly going in and coming out by her sexual organ; and the cutting off of her way from the best existence. 6. About the non-deliverance of a soul of the wicked from hell till the future existence. 7. About the punishment of the wicked _there is_ this, too, _it is_ as though a sheep which is alive should be remaining tied by the legs, head downwards, and _there_ should be a specific exudation of its toes through running at the nose [^4].

8\. About the Gâthas for an ordeal [^5] of the spiritual _existence_, which is concealed in every mode, _being_ without a footing (<i>a</i>p<i>â</i>\-pâstakŏ), as it were, for him who is a righteous chanter of the Gâthas.

9\. The excellence _of_ righteousness is perfect.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (204:2) The first two words of the first hâ of the third Gâtha (Yas. XLVII, 1), which are converted into the Pahlavi appellation S<i>p</i>endmaîtŏ.

[^3]: (204:3) By providing for the performance of the proper ceremonies for the benefit of one's own soul.

[^1]: (205:1) Pahl. vidanâânag vidanâânag, a hybrid equivalent of zamânak zamânak (see Bk. VIII, Chap. XXXV, 6 n).

[^2]: (205:2) B has ‘relapses.’

[^3]: (205:3) Compare AV. LXX.

[^4]: (205:4) Pahl. <i>a</i>fas angûstô zahîh-1-i mâyagânîk pavan vînîk-ta<i>g</i> <i>a</i><i>ê</i>. For mâyagânîk, ‘specific’ (which occurs, however, in Bk. VIII, Chap. XX, 166), we can read mâsânîk, ‘tumerous or coagulating,’ or we may consider it equivalent to mûyi<i>s</i>nîk, ‘lamentable.’

[^5]: (205:5) Compare the reference to the ordeal by fire in Pahl. Yas. XLVI, 6; the earlier part of the chapter is also somewhat of a homily upon the references to the wicked and righteous in the same hâ.
