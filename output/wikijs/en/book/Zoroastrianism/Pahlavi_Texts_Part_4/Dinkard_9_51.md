## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LI.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The fifth fargar<i>d</i>, Khshmaibyâ [^1], is about this, that complaint is made by Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan [^2] _that there_ did not exist _any one_ who properly keeps the cattle that are in his possession; even for this reason, because cattle are increased by such, and others, through design (âhang) and a desire for that increase, act by his example _and_ keep cattle properly; _but_ the complaint of Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan is _that_ he does not exist. 2. This, too, that by him who gives orders about the advancement _of_ the concerns of the sacred beings, the care of cattle is produced, and his soul attains to the sacred beings; even for this reason, because the care of cattle is a principal thing in the advancement of the concerns of the sacred beings, _and_ also for the preservation _of_ the soul. 3. This, too, that by him who keeps cattle with a controller (dastôbar) who is a cattle-master [^3], even a friend of him who is the creator of cattle is taught to the cattle—the cattle-master and he who is wise in the nourishment, protection, and multiplication of cattle—even for this reason, because when his cattle are kept with a controller who is a nourisher, protector, and multiplier of cattle, the friendship of a nourisher for the nourished, _of_ a protector for the protected, and _of_ a multiplier for the multipliable is also exhibited by him; _and_ the design of the creator for the creation, through affection, is that of a nourisher for the nourished, _of_ a protector for the protected, _and of_ a multiplier for the multipliable. <span id="p319"><sup><small>[ p. 319 ]</small></sup></span> 4\. This, too, that by him who maintains an animal with propriety, it is presented to the sacred beings; even for this reason, because when _it_ is maintained by him with propriety, the will of the sacred beings drives him on, and when the will of the sacred beings drives him on, it is presented by him to the sacred beings. 5. This, too, that when _one_ shall admit the male of animals at the _proper_ time, the mastery (sa<i>r</i>dârînî<i>d</i>anŏ) of the animal is also taught by him; even for this reason, because the admission of the male _of_ the animals is the essential business in the multiplication of cattle, and he who is a multiplier has also taught the mastery of the animals. 6. This, too, that by him who does not slaughter an animal until it attains to full growth, the formation of a store for cattle is also taught; even for this reason, because, from the increasing cattle produced, the profit of mankind arises, _and_ on account of the liking of mankind for profit, they persevere more fully in cultivating cattle, and provide a store for them.

7\. This, too, that _it is he_ who is the more powerful of beings—that is, strength is what is more in use _by_ him [^4]—whose proceeding is for him who is his own, so that he supplies that which it is necessary to supply; even for this reason, because needful bountifulness _to_ one's own needy ones arises through lawful thoughts, lawful thoughts are provided by expelling greed, lust, wrath, disgrace, envy, _and_ other fiends from the body, and a man expelling a fiend from _his_ body becomes of efficient strength. 8. This, too, that he is a very powerful person, for invocation [^4], supplication, and attaining to good works, <span id="p320"><sup><small>[ p. 320 ]</small></sup></span> who possesses wealth for the high-priest of the priests, who shall also procure decisions and judgment always justly, and who likewise becomes humble _and_ reverent _to_ the good; even for this reason, because the wealth of multitudes of mankind is for maintaining the desires and pleasure of the body, _for_ procuring decisions and judgment whereto their wishes tend, _and for_ others becoming humble and reverent _to_ them even when _their_ design is vicious; _but he_ who possesses wealth _for_ invocation _and_ connection _with_ the wisdom of the religion, through the high-priest of the religion, and shall procure just decisions and judgment, _and_ becomes humble and reverent _to_ the good, is a putter away of that design and _one_ who, through the putting away of that design, becomes a capable _and_ very powerful person.

9\. This, too, that every one is made to persevere at _his_ proper duty, _as to_ any excellent thing, by him who holds the reward of the diligent, as the sacred beings are proceeding _with_ a pure needy _one_; for this reason, because the toiling of the body of a person at _his_ proper duty is induced _by_ a desire of reward. 10. This, too, that by him whose mouth (yông) [^5] and _its_ appliances _are_ for virtue, the possession of Vohûman is then explained, through this mode, because the maintenance of the mouth and _its_ appliances as virtuous becomes so, when, through protection and assistance _of_ the good, _and_ defeat and smiting of the vile, the reformation of the world occurs; and this, too, is so, when _there is_ an existence of preparation of the friend of the good and the enemy <span id="p321"><sup><small>[ p. 321 ]</small></sup></span> of the vile, and of friendship of the good and enmity of the vile, through understanding good and evil; and the understanding of good and evil is through possession of Vohûman, _and_ that possession of Vohûman becomes also an explainer of Vohûman.

11\. This, too, that by him who gives commands about the progress of the concerns of the sacred beings, his own knowledge of every kind is also developed; even for this reason, _because_ the command _being_ necessary _for_ the personal duty of the good, they also develope the knowledge of every kind for which that commanding of duty and _its_ auspiciousness are suitable. 12. This, too, that by him who teaches the good, the good work is then appropriated which is also an assistance of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through speaking of the religion; even for this reason, because, on account of those of the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t who really constitute the renovation _of the universe_, the speaking connected with Zaratû<i>s</i>t—through the teaching of the good _and_ teachers not of the same religion—_and_ the assistance through speaking of the religion become the good work appropriated.

13\. This, too, that by him who gives anything to that person who praises the sacred beings _and_ the good, a throne is appropriated _in_ yonder _world_ [^6], even on the mention _of it_. 14. This, too, that by him who is teaching that which is for the propitious, the damage that is owing to want of resources [^7] in religion is shut out of the world; even for this reason, because, owing to that, he increases the resources of religion of every kind, _and_ the advantage <span id="p322"><sup><small>[ p. 322 ]</small></sup></span> therefrom, in the world. 15. This, too, that by him who is bringing him who is righteous forth to the rulers, for beneficence, the utmost assistance is then afforded; even for this reason, because an expectation of the utmost beneficence is further attached by him to the place of obtainment [^8].

16\. This, too, that by him who gives _him_self in service unto him who is the supreme king of kings, the way of good thinking [^9], _of_ the assistance of pleasure, and _of_ the production of sovereignty by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is disclosed to his own; even for this reason, because the original reason of virtue is the worthiness _of_ mankind owing to the creator _and_ their service unto the creator, and, therefore, as he who is a well-ruling monarch is a creator in the worldly _existence, and_ a recompensing (pa<i>d</i>ŏ-dahâk) leader of the creatures who steadfastly give _them_selves in service to him, it is then given by him to the creator also; and I teach, besides, _that_ the origin of the virtue of worthiness, which is attached by the creator to his own, is the way that is stated above, and other virtue is also disclosed to his own thereby.

17\. Righteousness is excellence _that is_ perfect.
