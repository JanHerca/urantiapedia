## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LIV.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The eighth fargar<i>d</i>, <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaiti [^3], is _that_ by him who teaches wisdom to others the not being deceived by an apostate into confusing a righteous _one_ (aharûbŏ-barî<i>s</i>îh) is also taught [^4]; even for this reason, because he who _has_ taught is not deceived. <span id="p341"><sup><small>[ p. 341 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. This, too, that by him who is as reverent _unto_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as a daughter _unto_ a father, and who is also a gratifier of virtuous doers, Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^1] is _made one_ of the archangels, and one is also made to love _her;_ even for this reason, because through that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>ic _one being_ reverent _unto_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the gratification of the good _by_ him, the archangels love and preserve her Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>ic nature (Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>îgîh). 3. This, too, that he who is loving Vohûman is taught by his wisdom not to destroy (nasânînî<i>d</i>a<i>n</i>ŏ) [^2] the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because wisdom maintains the religion in virtue, and others are taught about it.

4\. This, too, that by him who gives _him_self in discipleship unto the priests, _and_ who asks again that which he does not understand, learning (âmûkŏ) is taught; even for this reason, because the asking for knowledge again _by him_ who _has_ given _him_self in discipleship to a wise priest, increases knowledge; and the friends of knowledge, therefore, make him an example, and shall practise asking again, that which they do not understand, _from_ the disciples of the priests.

5\. This, too, that whoever is _in accordance_ with Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through pure affection, becomes, in like manner, _him_ who is giving strength _to_ the will of the archangels and the commands _of_ the good; even for this reason, because these two capabilities _are_ of the special nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 6. This, too, that through the discrimination of him who loves [^3] Vohûman Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <span id="p342"><sup><small>[ p. 342 ]</small></sup></span> is gratified; even for this reason, because _one_ loving Vohûman is loving wisdom and _has_ taught wisdom, wisdom taught is discrimination, and the discriminator becomes a gratifier of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

7\. This, too, that whoever gives thought to the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is taught wisdom; even for this reason, because all the wisdom of the good religion is taught to him by giving thought. 8. This, too, that whoever _has_ kept wealth in the control [^1] of Zaratû<i>s</i>t becomes taught, _and_ is _one_ who is reverent _to_ the benefiters; even for this reason, because whoever is reverent _to_ the supporters of religion keeps wealth in the control _of_ the supporters of religion, _and_, when kept by him in their control, it is kept by him in that of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

9\. This, too, that his destiny is connected with himself who practises industry. 10. This, too, that his good works _for_ arranging the creation become his own who has fully prepared his own person.

11\. The excellence _of_ righteousness is perfect.

## Footnotes

[^3]: (340:3) See Chap. IX, 1 n; it is here written khvamaîtŏ in Pahlavi.

[^4]: (340:4). See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 1-4.

[^1]: (341:1) See Pahl. Yas. XXXII, 2 c, and Bk. VIII, Chap. IX, 3.

[^2]: (341:2) Ibid. 4 c.

[^3]: (341:3) Ibid. 8 c. It is possible to read the verbal stem gôsh ‘hear,’ p. 342 instead of dôsh (Av. zush); but this is hardly possible in § 2, and gôshî<i>d</i>anŏ is not the usual Pahlavi for ‘to hear.’
