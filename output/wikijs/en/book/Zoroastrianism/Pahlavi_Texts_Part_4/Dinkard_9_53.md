## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LIII.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The seventh fargar<i>d</i>, Tâ-v<i>e</i>\-urvâtâ [^1], is _that_ by him who possesses advantage through virtue, the world of righteousness is _freed_ from [^2] destruction [^3]; even for this reason, because the possession of advantage through virtue arises through the non-participation of the demons _and_ the vile therein, and the participation of, the sacred beings _and_ the <span id="p328"><sup><small>[ p. 328 ]</small></sup></span> good; and, when _one_ shall act so, the advantage of spiritual origin becomes more powerful through guarding the advantage from the destroyers. 2. This, too, that, by him who welcomes Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in _his_ person, apostates are likewise forced to make the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> progressive [^4]; even for this reason, because owing to [^5] the apostasy of apostates _being_ a religion produced by Aharman, _they are_ only able to make the religion progressive through the appellation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; apostasy _and_ priesthood, _and_ the apostates _and_ priests, are fraternal opponents, and whenever the priesthood and multitudes of the priesthood are triumphant, multitudes of the apostates of apostasy perish (aôshênd), and when the multitudes of the apostates of apostasy are bold, the priests of the priesthood are weak; and the priests are superior _in_ power _and_ success when their priesthood is properly limited, and their properly-limited priesthood, too—which can arise through mankind—consists in the welcome precedence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

3\. About the completeness (s<i>p</i>ôrîkîh) _of_ the priesthood in that quality now, when the priests of the multitude are the habitation (mêhônŏ) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _and_ the power of the priests of the priesthood _has_ increased, the valour of the apostates of apostasy is smitten, and the apostates are defeated _by_ the abundant splendour of the priests, also their power as regards making the religion of Aharman progressive through the appellation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is fettered, _and_ they keep apostasy concealed [^6]. <span id="p329"><sup><small>[ p. 329 ]</small></sup></span> 4. And then also they, with the appellation of priests, truly speak and teach the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and make _it_ progressive, just as it is solemnized and made easy by them, even Though the will _of_ the sacred beings _be_ unheard _and_ undesired through apostasy.

5\. This, too, that he proclaims the miraculousness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^7], who shall appoint for ordeal that which is certainly a doubt; even for this reason, because, through accomplishing an ordeal, that which is doubtful is forcibly rendered visible (vên<i>â</i><i>v</i>dahakî-aîtŏ) to the eyes, as certain clearness, through the power of the spirit, _which_ is itself a miracle of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 6. This, too, that by him who shall make a public decision thereon, _as to_ the acquitted and convicted [^8], gratification is afforded to him whose maintenance of the dispute [^8] is righteous; even for this reason, because the needful is delivered by him to its own requirer _who_ thereby becomes even renowned. 7. This, too, that even the rite of ordeal \[is produced\] [^9] by him \[who is an advantage to the righteous; for this reason, because the rite of ordeal is for the advancement of the ordeal, and the religious ordeal\] proceeds through sovereignty; these righteous are those of the good religion, and their advantage is that belonging to the multitude, which is the sovereignty now, _and_ every one who is given for that advantage, to the <span id="p330"><sup><small>[ p. 330 ]</small></sup></span> righteous _of_ those of the good religion, becomes the performer of any rite of ordeal really produced, because the origin of that giving of advantage is even the rite of ordeal. 8. This, too, that by him who gives a priest and righteous _man_ for propagating the religion, the rite of ordeal is also proclaimed; even for this reason, because the teacher and one rightly merciful (hû-âmûr’<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>âr) give [^10] the sacred text by which even the rite of ordeal is declared.

9\. This, too, that _he_ who recites the revelation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and who shall do _it_ with exceeding goodness, becomes an increaser of wisdom; even for this reason, because the wisdom of a man increases in these two ways, either he speaks _and_ teaches himself, or he exemplifies the excellence of a portion to the wise who become speakers and teachers of wisdom. 10. This, too, that his homage is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, who thoroughly teaches a righteous employer _of_ animals and human beings (kî<i>r</i>â vavîr) that he considers _him_ as their controller (dastôbar); because, since the productiveness of the completion of the creatures is produced through the nourishment of the creatures _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> through his fulfilling his own productiveness, that righteous employer _in_ the world is _intended_ for the nourishment of his creatures, owing to that outward subjection and propitiation of theirs, _and_ the righteous employer is connected with _their_ subjection and propitiation _for_ the creator.

11\. This, too, that by him who gives thought to the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the soul is given to Zaratû<i>s</i>t; <span id="p331"><sup><small>[ p. 331 ]</small></sup></span> even for this reason, because with a man's _having_ given thought to the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is connected the receiving of his soul _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t for preservation from hell. 12. This, too, that by him who teaches the nature of the sacred beings to mankind, consultation with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is also further taught; even for this reason, because the nature of the sacred beings is consulting a spiritual lord, _and_ becomes also the consulting of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

13\. This, too, that by him who keeps the produce of sheep as the property of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, a sheep is given to him who is diligent _and_ moderate [^11]; even for this reason, because produce kept as the property of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is for _being_ given for good works, _being_ given for good works is _being_ truly kept as a beginning for the possession of produce, and a beginning truly kept is kept even through a sheep, as a beginning of excellence, in the control (dastôbarîh) of him who is a diligent _and_ moderate shepherd [^12]. 14. This, too, that by him who is liberal to the liberal the increase owing to developers is brought into the world; even for this reason, because a liberal _man_, on account of even that gift given back to the worthy, becomes even for us—through the development of the world—him who is first praised therein with the sacred beings. 15. This, too, that whoever shall form a store for sheep, becomes an agent even in the development _of_ sheep _by_ the creator; because, on account of the increase of sheep through the existence of nourishment for them _having_ arisen, whoever has arranged nourishment for sheep, becomes an agent even in the development <span id="p332"><sup><small>[ p. 332 ]</small></sup></span> _of_ sheep _by_ the creator. 16. This, too, that by him who teaches _inward_ prayer (v<i>â</i><i>k</i>akŏ) to the good, it is also taught _to_ eaters; even for this reason, because, everything connected with eating _being_ declared by the religion, when the religion is taught by _any_ one to the good, in which even that information is proclaimed, even eaters are taught about it. 17. This, too, that whoever maintains a sheep, _or_ human being, as our property, is taught to maintain it through the high-priest of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; even for this reason, because it _is_ so maintained as the property of the sacred beings, when he maintains _it_ as the property of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

18\. This, too, that by him who gave predominance to those of the nature of Gâyômar<i>d</i> [^13], the sovereignty also of those of the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is desired; even for this reason, because the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is the nature of Gâyômar<i>d</i>, and the nature of Gâyômar<i>d</i> is the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 19. This, too, that when _one is_ alone among rulers a way of speaking to the rulers such words _as are_ really true is thereby provided; even for this reason, because the utterance _of_ blessings _by_ a solitary _person_ is for advantage. 20. This, too, that by him who keeps the sovereignty which is his within the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the best thing is done unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because a sovereignty is so kept within the will of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> when he who is the ruler gives to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the individuality in which is the sovereignty, and when its proximity and closeness have given to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> that thing which is best _and_ supreme.

21\. This, too, that when _one_ teaches the sayings <span id="p333"><sup><small>[ p. 333 ]</small></sup></span> (v<i>â</i><i>k</i>akŏ) _of_ the benefiters, the information which is owing to the religion is illustrated [^14] by him to his own; even for this reason, because the knowledge of religion, which is in _its_ causing liberality by him, is increased even by the repeated enquiry of disciples. 22. This, too, that by him who teaches an applicant the virtuous way and doctrine (pand) the liturgy is then taught; even for this reason, because knowledge arises through the virtuous course of the liturgy [^15]. 23. This, too, that by him who thinks of the affairs of virtue, the liturgy is maintained _and_ taught with virtuousness [^15]; even for this reason, because the maintenance of the liturgy with virtuousness arises through virtuous thinking.

24\. This, too, that whoever shall provide the nourishment of creatures with propriety, his Vohûman (_good thought_) is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s progeny [^16]; and whoever properly maintains those which are in his keeping, his position becomes Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s fatherhood of Vohûman [^17] even for this reason, because every proper nourishing is that in which the nourished becomes an offspring such as Vohûman unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and every proper protection of the creatures, over those which are protected by it, is a fatherhood such as _that of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> over Vohûman. 25. This, too, that by him who shall provide nourishment with propriety _for_ the creation which is good, it is taught _that_ the good creation _was_ produced _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because from the nourishment of the creation with propriety, _together_ with the discriminating action of the nourisher, the goodness of the nourished is also <span id="p334"><sup><small>[ p. 334 ]</small></sup></span> evident, from the goodness of the nourished creation the goodness _of_ him who is its creator is evident, and the creator of the good creation is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> himself.

26\. This, too, that whoever shall spiritually make Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the ruler over _his_ own person becomes a ruler as to actions [^18]; even for this reason, because whoever is making Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> ruler over his person is a leader of wisdom, a leader of wisdom is a decider taking account of sin and good works, taking account of sin and good works is abstaining from sin _and_ practising good works, and owing to abstinence _from_ sin and practising good works one becomes a ruler over actions. 27. This, too, that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^19] is given to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> by him who is as reverent unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as a daughter unto a father; even for this reason, because the Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>ic nature (S<i>p</i>enda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>îh) is provided by him _for_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

28\. This, too, that for him _who_ thinks of the care of cattle _there_ arises that wisdom [^20] which the control (patîh) of cattle gives; even for this reason, because the nature of the wisdom _for_ a production of cattle is provided in mankind, and, when mankind apply _their_ thoughts to seeking that wisdom, they obtain _it_. 29. This, too, that by him who is admitting the male _to_ cattle at the _proper_ time, the care of cattle is also thought of; even for this reason, because the admittance of the male becomes productiveness, and whoever [^21] would cause productiveness thinks also of nourishment. <span id="p335"><sup><small>[ p. 335 ]</small></sup></span> 30\. This, too, that by him who _has_ prepared _him_self for the priests the way to yonder [^22] _world_ is taught; even for this reason, because the way to yonder _world_ is declared by the religion, and its indicator is the priest; therefore, by him who is prepared for the priests, through discipleship, that way is known and is made known. 31. This, too, that _in_ him who shall do that which is something that is an assistance to the renovation _of the universe_, thoughts of the bounty (dahîh) of the creator arise; even for this reason, because creativeness is through thinking of the renovation, thinking of the renovation arises through the renovation, the renovation arises through anything which is done that is an assistance of the renovation, the doing of anything that is an assistance of the renovation is through thinking of sagacity, and thinking of sagacity becomes thoughts of the bounty of the creator.

32\. This, too, that by him who loves the affairs of the archangels a heart and mind [^23], _for_ not being misled from the way of the sacred beings, are recommended to mankind; even for this reason, because from the religion of the sacred beings being loved _arises_ increasing power of the sacred beings, from the increasing power of the sacred beings _arises_ their greater authority among mankind, _and_ from the greater authority of the sacred beings among mankind arises the resistance of heart and mind of mankind, even in their not being misled by the very demons. 33. This, too, that whoever shall act with reverence _to_ Vohûman sees the sin which is concealed in _him_ mingled with good works <span id="p336"><sup><small>[ p. 336 ]</small></sup></span> thereby [^24]; even for this reason, because reverence for Vohûman becomes submission (hêrîh) in virtuousness, with virtuous submission are connected freedom from Kîkship and from Karapship [^25], and with freedom from Kîkship and from Karapship _is connected one_ sound of life _and_ eye, whereby _he is_ an observant decider, and atonement _for_ sin arises from good works.

34\. This, too, that by him who shall provide liberality for the liberal, the giving of a loans to mankind is also taught; even for this reason, because liberal giving by any one is accounting for his own debt, and he endeavours to repay _it_ fully observantly and with complete gratification; besides that, the power of liberality becomes extendible among mankind, _and_ through loans and other gifts [^26] _of_ generosity (dahi<i>s</i>nîkîh) they become ardent. 35. This, too, that by him who pays homage (franâmê<i>d</i>ŏ) to the affairs of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as much as he is able, the non-injury of the innocent is also taught; even for this reason, because to intertwine further (frôv<i>â</i>ftanŏ) with the affairs of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as much as possible, is first _to commit_ no sin _and_ to perform as many good works as possible, _and_ abstaining from the essentials of sin is non-injury of the innocent. 36. This, too, that by him who possesses a ruler and high-priest Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is <span id="p337"><sup><small>[ p. 337 ]</small></sup></span> spiritually made ruler over his person [^27]; even for this reason, because, through the requirement of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the angels are lord and master of the worldly _existence_ of that _man_.

37\. This, too, that whoever decides duty and opinion becomes also an informer of others; even for this reason, because it informs others that _he is_ possessing wisdom, and this is what is said, that ‘the wisdom of a man is evident from _his_ deciding as to affairs.’ 38. This, too, that whoever shall provide nurture with propriety becomes also an indicator (dakhshakînî<i>d</i>âr) [^28] _for_ others; even for this reason, because the happiness of the nurturer becomes also a happy indicator even _for_ thee; and this, too, is what _one_ says, that ‘always good, happy, _and_ free from serfs [^29] is he who is not a master of vagabonds (pa<i>d</i>ŏ-î pûân).’

39\. This, too, that by him who is a ruler who, by a command given, appoints him who is liturgical (mânsarîk), and gives anything to him which it is desirable to give, the necessary demeanour for true _and_ virtuous statements [^30] is taught; even for this reason, because the uttering of true _and_ virtuous statements, in fearlessness [^30] of rulers, is owing to a well-established sovereignty, and their well-established sovereignty is more particularly through these two _things_, good commanding and helpfulness; when they establish that liturgical _one_ by a command given _it_ is good commanding, and when they give <span id="p338"><sup><small>[ p. 338 ]</small></sup></span> anything to him which it is desirable to give the helpfulness is provided; also, owing to their good commanding, the helpfulness is a good establishment _of_ the sovereignty, owing to a well-established sovereignty _there_ is fearlessness also in uttering true _and_ virtuous statements, and, owing to freedom from concealment in uttering true _and_ virtuous statements, the necessary demeanour for true and virtuous statements arises. 40. This, too, that _he_ who gives personal service unto the king of kings, and who considers the product (bar) as the property of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is empowered for indicating the acquitted and convicted [^31] _by_ the spirits, his indicators of the acquitted _and_ convicted; even for this reason, because the person _being_ given in service to the king of kings is the preparation (nîvâri<i>s</i>nŏ) of subjection, and the product _being_ considered as the property of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is to consider the innocence of _its_ origin (bûn) and to make the product well-selecting (hû-<i>k</i>înakŏ) through virtuousness; owing to the progress of these two, the virtuousness in the world becomes great _and_ increasing productiveness for all the good spiritual and worldly _existences_ which are in it, even those who are angels indicating the acquitted and convicted.

41\. This, too, that by him who becomes immortal progress [^32] for him who is immortally progressive, complete progress [^32] is given to him who is completely progressive; and its routine (dâ<i>d</i>istân), too, <span id="p339"><sup><small>[ p. 339 ]</small></sup></span> is even this, that by him who wishes [^33] to make that which is his own soul immortal, _and_ would afford _it_ assistance, every benefit is given to him who is a supplicant _for_ every benefit _and_ becomes a giver of every benefit which he begs, which becomes an assistance to him whom he asks in attaining thereto. 42. This, too, that whoever gratifies that which is enjoyment renders _his_ soul immortal; even for this reason, because the soul subsists through good works, and good works are all those which gratify enjoyment. 43. This, too, that whoever keeps himself always in good works [^34] has produced perfection and happiness by any goodness _and_ worthiness of his; even for this reason, because keeping oneself always in good works becomes perfect diligence in industry, within perfect diligence in industry is also comprised opposition to any harm whatever, and it is opposition to harm and perfect goodness that are worthy of every happiness.

44\. This, too, that by him who possesses wealth as high-priest of the priests, predominance as their high-priest is maintained [^35] _and_ taught; even for this reason, because the provision of sovereignty and _its_ progress are really through wealth. 45. This, too, that by him who would act for the pleasure of others, owing to virtue, the growth _and_ increase owing to Vohûman [^36] are produced; even for this reason, because that which has given virtuous pleasure is the nourishment of the creatures by the producer of increase and growth.

46\. This, too, that by him who welcomes Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <span id="p340"><sup><small>[ p. 340 ]</small></sup></span> in _him_self [^37], and teaches good works to mankind, every virtuous instruction is taught; even for this reason, because the welcoming of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in _one_self is the non-committal of sin, _and_ the teaching of good works to mankind is more particularly the performance of good works oneself; innocence and the practising of good works are the end of every instruction, and _he_ in whom they exist becomes a teacher of every goodness. 47. This, too, that by him who shall occasion benefit through him who is a propagator of good works, the evidence of him _who is_ well-informed [^38] is taught through _one_ well-informed; even for this reason, because the chief evidence as to sagacity is to occasion benefit for the good. 48. This, too, that by him who gives commands as to the affairs of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is made welcome in _his_ person [^37]; even for this reason, because the throne of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in the worldly _existence_ is more particularly in a ruler of well-commanding person.

49\. The excellence _of_ righteousness is perfect.

[^6]: (328:3) The passage in the Pahlavi commentary on this Nask, which p. 329 is here described, must evidently have been written shortly after some great triumph of the priesthood over some heresy, probably either that of Mânî, or that of Mazdak.

[^25]: (336:2) Pahl. akîkîh va-akarapîh; see Bk. VIII, Chap. XXXV, 13 n for the two idolatrous priestly tribes here alluded to. On its second occurrence the first word is corrupted into âkâs which closely resembles akîgîh in Pahlavi letters.
