## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XLV.

1\. Of the three divisions of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht [^1], as it exists in its 133 sections, the first is _of_ thirteen [^2] sections, _and contains_ particulars about the nature of the recital of the Ahunavair [^3], which is the spiritual benefit from chanting it aloud, and whatever is on the same subject [^4]. 2. Advice about selecting _and_ <span id="p167"><sup><small>[ p. 167 ]</small></sup></span> keeping a spiritual and worldly high-priest, performing every duty as to the high-priest, and maintaining even those of various high-priests.

3\. About the twenty-one chieftainships, spiritually through Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and materially through Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through which the ceremonial of the sacred beings _and_ the government of the members of the community (dâhmânŏ râyînî<i>d</i>ârîh) exist. 4. About the duties in the five periods [^5] of the day and night, each separately, and the bridge_\-judgment_ of him who shouts out [^6] in the ceremony of a season-festival [^7]; _likewise of_ him who does not provide the preparations for the feast of a season-festival, and who also becomes worried (sû<i>d</i>akŏ) in other ceremonials of the sacred beings.

5\. About how to consider _and_ what to do with a sacerdotal leader _and_ a man _of_ the superior classes (pî<i>s</i>akîkânŏ), him who atones for unimportant sin, and him who does not atone even for _that which is_ important; _and_ whatever is on the same subject. 6. About the means through which membership of the community (dâhmîh) is prepared. 7. About the manifestation of virtuous manhood, and the merit and advantage from well uttering the words _of blessing_ at eating _and_ drinking food _and_ drink, and _from_ despising the inward talk of the demons. <span id="p168"><sup><small>[ p. 168 ]</small></sup></span> 8. About the recitations at the five periods _of the day_, the ceremonial invocation by name of many angels in each separately, _and_ great information on the same subject.

9\. The worthiness _of_ a man restrained (vandak) by authority, the devotion of life and body to the sacred beings, the good rulers, and their examination and satisfaction; _also_ the blessing and winning words which are most successful in carrying off the affliction that is owing to the fiend. 10. About all-pleasing creativeness and omniscience, every precedence [^8], leadership, foresight [^9], worthy liberality, perspicacity (vênâkîh), and all proper cause _and_ effect of righteousness; the individuality (khû<i>d</i>îh) of righteousness, the opposition to the demons of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s law, and also much other information in the same section.

11\. The middle _division_ is _of_ 102 sections _containing_ particulars about spiritual and worldly diligence, the leadership _of_ the diligent and their mighty means, all the former deeds of righteousness. 12. Righteousness kindling the resolution is the reward of merit, each for each, and is provided by it for that which _one_ mentions thus:—‘_It is_ the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht which is the maintenance of righteousness, so that it may make righteousness more abiding in the body of a man.’

13\. The last _division_ is _of_ nineteen sections _containing_ a trusty remedy, that is, a remedy whose utterance aloud by the faithful is a chief resource (<i>a</i>fzârtûm) for the creatures of the sacred beings. <span id="p169"><sup><small>[ p. 169 ]</small></sup></span> 14. Also the nature of sayings full of humility (pûrpâstîh), well-favoured, most select, _and_ adapted _for_ that which _one_ mentions thus:—‘I reverence that chief, the beneficent _and_ eminent Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht, out of which is the sustainment of the strength of every word of Zaratû<i>s</i>t they trust in.’

15\. It is perfect excellence _that_ is righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (166:3) Corresponding to the twentieth word, dada<i>d</i>, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the twenty-first, and last, Nask in other Rivâyats. Its name occurs in the Avesta, in the form hadhaokhta, and it is called Hâdukht in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained thirty kardah, or fargar<i>d</i>s, which differs considerably from the number stated in this chapter. Yts. XXI, XXII are traditionally supposed to belong to the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht, but there is hardly a trace of either of them in this chapter. Yt. XI is also distinguished by the same title.

[^2]: (166:4) As the total of the 13 + 102 + 19 sections (mentioned in §§ 1, 11, 13) is 134, instead of 133, there must be an error in one of the four numbers given in the MS. This clerical error can hardly have been made in writing 19, and is unlikely in 102; but 133 may possibly stand for an original 134, though the writing of 13 instead of 12 is more probable. The Rivâyats give no assistance in settling this question, as they all divide this Nask into 30 kardah. On the whole, it will be safest to read ‘twelve,’ instead of ‘thirteen,’ until some better authority becomes available.

[^3]: (166:5) Compare Yt. XI, 3.

[^4]: (166:6) It is just possible that this may refer to Yt. XXI which, though specially alluding to the recitation of the Ashem-vohû, or praise of p. 167 righteousness, also mentions that of the Ahunavair in its § 4. With regard, however, to Yt. XXII, there seems no possibility of identifying its text with any portion of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask as described in this chapter.

[^5]: (167:1) See Chap. XXIX, 9.

[^6]: (167:2) Reading ba<i>r</i>â drâyê<i>d</i>ŏ, but it may be ba<i>r</i>â girâyê<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘is zealous.’

[^7]: (167:3) See Chap. VII, 1.

[^8]: (168:1) Assuming that pe<i>s</i>âgîh stands for pê<i>s</i>agîh.

[^9]: (168:2) Assuming that pe<i>s</i> vônâkîh stands for pê<i>s</i> vênâkîh.
