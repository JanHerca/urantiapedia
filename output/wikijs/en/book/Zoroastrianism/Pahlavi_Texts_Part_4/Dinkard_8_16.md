## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XVII.

1\. The beginning of the law is the Nîkâ<i>d</i>ûm [^1] of thirty fargar<i>d</i>s [^2]. 2. The section Patkâr-ra<i>d</i>istân (‘_magistrate code_’) [^3] is about this, that the ruin _and_ misery (ayôyakîh) from the destroyer, for mankind and animals, occurring really apart from the spiritual _existence_, have arisen through the sinfulness even of <span id="p36"><sup><small>[ p. 36 ]</small></sup></span> mankind; _and_ the progress of ruin and misery in the world is owing to unauthorisedly assaulting one another. 3. Advice. to mankind about abstaining therefrom, _with_ an estimate of an authorised assault, _and_, again, for a slight assault and no assault. 4. To stand magisterially, even opposed to the unmagisterial, with freedom from hurt and loss to oneself; _and_ to abstain altogether, likewise, from the most innocuous (anakhrûgûnôtam) assault even upon an unmagisterial _person_.

5\. _In_ all magisterial investigation (patkâr-ra<i>d</i>îh)—of which, when the custom that exists is established judicially, the substance is two statements, which are verbal and demonstrable, that subsist in different combinations—_there_ are four species: the verbal and demonstrable, the verbal which is not demonstrable, the demonstrable _which_ is not verbal, _and that which is_ neither verbal nor yet demonstrable. 6. In the arguments (sâmân) which are allotted _as_ verbal are four species, the dispute _having_ different arguments _and_ different assertions which are for unmagisterial investigation, for one's own priestly authority (ra<i>d</i>ŏ), for another good man—three of such being requisite [^4]—and also for other evidence [^5]. 7. And in those which are allotted as demonstrable are six species, and for an unmagisterial _person_ the assertions, like the previous species which are on the same subject, are twelve [^6]. 8. Of <span id="p37"><sup><small>[ p. 37 ]</small></sup></span> all unmagisterial proceedings—which, though it be a custom, is to proceed unauthorisedly—the species are five [^7], which consist in _having_ demonstrated, getting upon, striking [^8], _having_ caused a wound, and _having_ slain.

9: Of _those_ subject to the magistrate (patkâr-ra<i>d</i>ŏ-hômônd) the twelve species are divided into four sections of three each. 10. One section are the hearing who are seeing, they to whom a dispute which is verbal \[is demonstrable; the hearing who are not seeing, they to whom a dispute which is verbal [^9]\] is not demonstrable; and the seeing who are not hearing, they to whom even a dispute which is demonstrable is not verbal. 11. And with these three, who are in one section, there is magisterial investigation; and the magistrate, unless (ba<i>r</i>â hat) [^10] risk for the body _be_ certain, is then irresistible; which is as though it be said _that_ to restrain by <span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span> wounding (rêsh) is not justifiable, _but_ the decision therein is this, that, when they do not change through lawful litigation, and they cannot hold back without wounding, _it_ is justifiable to keep _them_ back even by wounding. 12. One section are the not hearing who are also not seeing, the women, and the children; and with these three, who are in one section, there is no magisterial investigation; and the decision _as to_ the bodies thereof is this, that, unless risk for the body _be_ certain from their complete change, they are then to be completely changed (ba<i>r</i>â var<i>d</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ). 13. One section are the foreigner and _him_ worthy of death, certain of thereby producing a sentence for _being_ executed from the judges; _also_ the highwayman, when he stays on the highway and his destruction is proclaimed, _but_ it is not possible to effect _it_. 14. With these three, likewise, who are in one section, there is no magisterial investigation, but the decision about them is even this, that when _one_ is utterly destroying their life, _one_ is thereby possessing merit. 15. One section are they who are walking, _or_ coming upon _one_, unseasonably, _or_ retreating confused into a rugged place, _and_, when _people_ ask them to speak, _they_ are giving no answer, _and_ they are not suspicious as foreigners. 16. With these three, likewise, who are in one section, there is no magisterial investigation, and the decision about them is this, that when _one_ kills them outright, _one_ does not become sinful thereby.

17\. _As to_ whatever is on the same subject it introduces many opinions, and also this, that a counter-assault (<i>a</i><i>v</i><i>â</i><i>z</i>\-zatam) is that which becomes a blow and wound, _and_ is to be so committed when it <span id="p39"><sup><small>[ p. 39 ]</small></sup></span> is possible to produce _them_ again exactly in every single particular.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (35:2) Corresponding to the fifteenth word, khshathrem<i>k</i>â, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the sixteenth Nask in other Rivâyats. This name should probably be Vîk-<i>a</i><i>î</i>t-tûm, meaning ‘the most separate concerns,’ as the Nask refers chiefly to public law; but it is called Niyâram, or Niyâdâm, in the Rivâyats.

[^2]: (35:3) The Rivâyats say fifty-four kardah, which number may have been obtained by adding the ‘twenty-four particulars,’ mentioned in Chap. XX, 1, to the thirty fargar<i>d</i>s stated here.

[^3]: (35:4) The patkâr-ra<i>d</i>, or settler of disputes, appears to have held a position somewhere between an arbitrator and a judge, and which may be approximately defined as that of a magistrate.

[^4]: (36:1) Evidently referring to arbitrators with an umpire.

[^5]: (36:2) Reading hanŏ gôkâyîh, but hanŏ is an unusual form. Perhaps agôkâyîh, ‘want of evidence,’ would be more suitable to the context.

[^6]: (36:3) So the MS., but ‘four’ would suit the context better, and the two Pahlavi ciphers do not differ much in shape.

[^7]: (37:1) These five grades of unauthorised retribution are analogous to the five grades of personal outrage mentioned in Vend. IV, 17.

[^8]: (37:2) Pahl. zatam, ‘a blow, assault, striking,’ is used throughout, instead of zâkham (Pers. za‘<i>h</i>m), which latter word does not occur in these two books of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, except in the form zakhamî-hastanŏ in Bk. IX, Chap. VIII, 6. The Farhang-î Oîm-aêvak also uses zatôm in the same sense, in its oldest MSS.; and Dd. V, 1 has zatam. Darmesteter suggests that zatam and zâkham are both traceable to an original zathma, or zathema.

[^9]: (37:3) The words in brackets are omitted by mistake in the MS.

[^10]: (37:4) The ambiguity, mentioned in the latter clause of this section, appears to lie in these words, which mean either ‘but if’ or ‘only if.’ Such ambiguity must have existed in the original Pahlavi text of the Nask, and probably indicates that the earlier part of this section is a summary of the Pahlavi version of the original Avesta text, while the latter part is a summary of the Pahlavi commentary upon that version. As the same ambiguity occurs, without comment, in § 12, where the meaning seems tolerably certain, it is doubtful if the commentator's opinion can be adopted.
