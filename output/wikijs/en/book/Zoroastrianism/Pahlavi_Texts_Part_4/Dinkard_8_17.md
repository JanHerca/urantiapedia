## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XVII.

_Nîkâ<i>d</i>ûm Nask_.

1\. The second section is the Zatamistân (‘_assault code_’), particulars about assault (zatam) and the annoyances (vêshîgânŏ) from assault, such as pain, blood, and unconsciousness; _also_ the sin [^1] that a man may commit in a state of unconsciousness. 2. About the seven kinds of symptoms of unconsciousness, and separate decisions about assaults that adults may commit among those who are children; also as regards an assault which proceeds to pain _and_ blood, and as regards that _in_ which the duration of the disposition of wrath abates the pain _and_ blood.

3\. About begging (khvahî<i>s</i>nŏ) _and_ beneficence (hû-dahî<i>s</i>nŏ) [^2], such as those of which one says in particular _there_ are four species: when stinginess (pû<i>s</i>îh) benefits pride (pîkŏ), when pride benefits stinginess, when stinginess benefits stinginess, and when pride benefits pride; and _there_ are three other species that originate from these _last_ two, in consultation together, when stinginess and pride benefit stinginess and pride, when stinginess and pride benefit stinginess, and when stinginess and pride benefit pride, _all_ which, _together_, constitute the seven primary species; many others, too, are traced back to these. 4. Also about seeing the depravity (khang <span id="p40"><sup><small>[ p. 40 ]</small></sup></span> dî<i>d</i>anŏ) of a perverting member of the community (kastâr dâhm) and of the perverter of a member of the community, and whatever is on the same subject.

5\. About a weapon seizable, and a weapon one brings, there is this, namely, what is the thing which is imperfect (anas<i>p</i>ôrîk) as a weapon, what is that which is not, and what is that which is welcome as a weapon; what is that which, when any one forces it back at any one as a weapon, is itself something annoying to him; what is his natural annoyance and what his imparted; and the penalty in property and difference of sentence on a man who is carrying a weapon, due to any weapon he has to carry away.

6\. About the six modes of engaging in conflict: through assault, tumult (khva<i>s</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) [^3], false teaching (mîtôk-sâstô) [^4], giving no food (atapdâ<i>d</i>ŏ) [^5], speaking with wizard's spells [^6], and speaking with threats of danger [^7]; and, where there is an engaging <span id="p41"><sup><small>[ p. 41 ]</small></sup></span> in conflict, it then occurs when _one has_ stood up for beginning _it_ and the assault is committed, _on_ one by the other, _and_ not before. 7. And this, too, that engaging in conflict occurs _as regards_ adult with adult, childless women with childless women, pregnant women with pregnant women, and children of seven years with children of seven years—_but_, as regards children of seven years in sight of _their_ fathers, it becomes an engaging in conflict of the fathers—and the decision about it is this, that the atonement for every sin which may be committed through engaging in conflict goes to the priestly authorities.

8\. About the affliction _of_ a pure lord who sees any one _who_ has been useless (abûn) unto _his_ slave, though the slave is beseeching, and does not contend for _his_ ownership. 9. About sin _affecting_ accusers [^8] not being atoned for by any other good work, except unto the accuser himself; _also_ about the slaying of a servant together with _his_ lord, _and_ whatever is on the same subject.

To. About slaying _by_ untaught children of seven years, _or_ even of eight years in sight of _their_ fathers; _and_ the criminality of the fathers therein, when _it_ is possible for them to hinder _it and_ they do not hinder _it_, and when _it_ is not possible for them to hinder _it_.
