## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXVIII.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The fifth fargar<i>d</i>, Yânîm-manô [^1], is about the beneficence _and_ worthiness of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through the virtuousness of his thoughts, words, _and_ deeds [^2]; the priority of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^3], and the first possession of obeisance (nîyâyisnŏ) to him; the mindful performance of obeisance _to_ the sacred beings, _and_ all the merit _of_ obeisance _to_ the sacred beings; the excellence of receiving a righteous man, _of_ bringing fire together, and _of_ maintaining the good religion; the elementary (khâm) wisdom [^4] of the creator, and the consideration of every duty towards his will and creation; the outward indication as to propitious discrimination and _of what_ is done _by_ those who are propitious; _and_ the existence _of_ every kind of self-attraction _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t towards the religion, from first to last, through the complete reasoning thought that arose solely through obeisance _to_ the sacred beings.

2\. This, too, that ‘thou art come to the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân) [^5], O righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t! thou <span id="p235"><sup><small>[ p. 235 ]</small></sup></span> art aware of the deeds, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! which _were_ practised by those in the bodily existence, _and_ which still they practise, and the sacred beings have placed upon mankind acquiring the power of good works.’ 3. And about the wonderfulness of the supreme heaven _there is_ this, too, that whoever is in that abode is not any one _that_ passes away after _his_ birth; at the time of the renovation _of the universe_ the supreme heaven is lowered down to the star station [^6], the earth _being_ up to there, and Vohûman [^7] is summoned for every purpose to the conference, and, when they call him, Mit<i>r</i>ô's [^8] investigation as regards the existence of righteousness is on the spot; through the coming of that archangel [^9] of true statements for assistance, and through the co-operation of the _other_ archangels and Srôsh [^7] the righteous, is the overpowering of the vexing of distressers [^10]; and the assistance of the archangels for Zaratû<i>s</i>t was when he went forth for disabling the vicious law of Irân. 4. Concerning Zaratû<i>s</i>t _there is_ this, too, in the words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, that is: ‘Thou art our own, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! and this liberality _to_ thee is ours; anything _one_ gives to thee is given by him _to_ us;’ also the announcement to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ the bringing _of him to_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^11] for his assistance and likewise the strength [^12] of his sovereignty for him. <span id="p236"><sup><small>[ p. 236 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. The discipleship and veneration of Frashô<i>s</i>tar [^13] also, and the laudation of Frashô<i>s</i>tar for making the religion progressive and _for its_ true transmission in the words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; also the whole righteousness of those whom Frashô<i>s</i>tar attracted to the religion.

6\. About the laudation of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _there is_ this, too, that is: ‘_Thou art_ not astray _from_ us, neither in life, nor in enquiry, nor _in_ openly announcing, even when demonstrating [^14] the religion to others, nor in anything whatever, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! _from_ us who are archangels; and the donation of benefit to supplicants is the food, and the clothing for us, who are in the ceremonial _of_ the sacred beings, is unworn (asû<i>d</i>akŏ) [^15].’

7\. About guarding a friend, managing an unfriendly _person_, and affording a person shelter for the sake of protection, justice, and rectitude [^16]; also the unworthy condition of that man who, requiring to perform those duties and good works that are important, shall perform those that are trivial. 8. And this, too, that is: ‘Thou art likewise aware, _and_ thou also understandest it, <i>O</i> righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t! through the sagacity of my wisdom, which was the first among existences [^17], and which is also so unto the last existence.’

9\. Righteousness is excellence _that is_ perfect.
