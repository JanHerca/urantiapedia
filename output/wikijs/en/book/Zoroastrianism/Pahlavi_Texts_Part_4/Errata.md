P. [89](sbe37029_htm.html), ll. 9, 10, for ‘the Irânian nationality (Aîrîh)’ read ‘subjection (hêrih)’

P. [186](sbe37059_htm.html), ll. 19, 20, for ‘preparation’ read ‘bespattering’

In several places it would be better to read âmûkŏ,‘ teaching,’ instead of hamô-kun, ‘every kind (or mode),’ so as to obtain the following amended passages:—

P. [23](sbe37012_htm.html), ll. 14-16. Then the exalting chanted teaching of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> for Zaratû<i>s</i>t is called, &c.

P. [24](sbe37014_htm.html), l. 1, the teaching for Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp; &c.

P. [114](sbe37039_htm.html), ll. 15-18, the meritoriousness in the guardianship and teaching by the keepers of those flocks; the happy effect of the flock and that of the keeper's teaching; &c.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„  ll. 23-28, that of the disciple through the teaching by the priestly instructor; the teaching of the priestly instructor for the pupil, and the happy effect of the priestly instructor's teaching in similar matters.

P. [119](sbe37040_htm.html), ll. 2-5, the want of eminence of any one through a teaching that is an offence to others, which is owing to his closed doors and evil eminence in teaching; &c.

Professor Darmesteter has suggested the following correction:—

P. [26](sbe37016_htm.html), ll. 22, 23, for ‘_based_ upon the traditional early law (vâsarî<i>d</i> pê<i>s</i>dâdŏ)’ read ‘_dependent_ upon Vâêgerê<i>d</i> the Pê<i>s</i>dâ<i>d</i>ian;’ \[who was the twin brother of Hôshâng; see Sachau's Albîrûnî's Chronology of Ancient Nations, pp. 206, 211\].
