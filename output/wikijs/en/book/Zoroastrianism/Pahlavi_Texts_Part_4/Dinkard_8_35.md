## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XXXV.

_Hûspâram Nask_.

1\. One section _contains_ particulars about the science (dâni<i>s</i>nŏ) of seeking a son, advice about it from revelation (dênô), the advantage of offspring for the admonitory explanation of revelation within _one's_ self, _and_ the harm owing to neglecting the advice of the same.

2\. About what _happens_ in the begetting of a son; the first sexual excitement it should produce for the female, the second, third, fourth, _and_ fifth; the arising of a son in the world, _and_ also the milk, owing to _her_ impregnation. 3. And, when _it is_ so that it amounts to a son, which of the _two_, male _or_ female, is sooner emitting the germs at the time _of_ occurrence; _and_ how _and_ how long both _have_ remained, at the time, in semination, how long in connection, and how long in bleeding. 4. When _and_ wherefrom various expectations are produced to contend _about_, and when and by what signs the male sex, or female sex, of the offspring _has_ become manifest.

5\. When the localization [^1] regarding _it_ is arranged; and, _as to_ the members, which is the first member therein, and _their_ being produced, each consecutively, till the bodily form is complete; which, _and_ in what position, is the localization of the members after the complete production of the form of the body, _and_ the purpose as regards the position _and_ localization of the members after the complete production _of_ the <span id="p110"><sup><small>[ p. 110 ]</small></sup></span> form of the body. 6. The effect upon the offspring which is _furnished_ with subjection to the male, so far as the complete effecting of it is within the limit for its authorisation [^2]; the time (vidanâânag [^3]) of the offspring with the female, the period of its turning downwards for birth, _and_ the occurrence of birth _at_ the same time.

7\. About the growth of life, too, with the bodily organs (tanûgân); _and_ which is the first bone become possessed of marrow, _apart_ from the other bones, as it is reported. 8. About the admissibility of the elaboration _of_ the male sex, _or_ female sex, within it, _by_ the guardian spirit of the righteous, at the fifth month; and the ceremony for the guardian spirit of the righteous for the sake of the arrival of a male child.

9\. About the act of childbirth by a pregnant woman before _recourse to_ midwifery (dâigânîh), except that relating to the navel string of the child; also its first and second food, and when the midwifery is _that_ of her mother; what is the kind of milk, _and_ the care of the child at the time, _its_ bandaging, sleeping, nourishment, and protection; _and_ the sin owing to acting unlawfully in such matters. 10. About how many months is the bearing of the offspring in the womb _of_ the camel, horse, ass, <span id="p111"><sup><small>[ p. 111 ]</small></sup></span> cow, and woman; and whatever is on the same subject. 11. About the spiritual perception _of_ a newborn child, _and its_ coming into the boundaries of worldly comprehension on the same subjects.

12\. About the habits through which multitudes _of_ mankind _attain_ to the acme of beautiful form: that of desire for women, that of swiftness which is owing to the strength of the leg, and that of powerfulness which is owing to the vigour of the body, that of desire for wealth, that of speaking in an assembly, and that of speaking at a distance, that through which _any one_ uncontrolled comes to a downfall, that through which _there is_ more knowledge of obedience, _and_ that through which a counteraction of the affliction of the race arises.

13\. About the vicious desire of the performer _and_ permitter of unnatural intercourse; also their violent lustfulness, heinous practice, and corrupt, polluted bodies, blighted in destiny; great through their destruction of life in the things which they see, and every greatness inevitably provides _them_ a merited death; _as_ great in sinfulness as <i>A</i><i>z</i>\-î Dahâk [^4] in oppression, _as_ the serpent Srôbar [^5] in witchcraft, _as_ Tûr-î Brâ<i>d</i>rô-rêsh [^6], the Karap [^7], in destroying the <span id="p112"><sup><small>[ p. 112 ]</small></sup></span> righteous, _and as_ a deceiving apostate in falsehood. 14. About the grievous sinfulness of a woman, just delivered and giving milk, whose progeny is the offspring from intercourse with divers males, and whatever is on the same subject.

15\. About the increasing vigour _of_ the female from the mounting of the male, and the diminished vigour of the male from mounting _on_ to the female.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (109:1) Assuming that gêsî-hastanŏ stands for gâsî-hastanŏ in all three occurrences of the word. This is rather doubtful, because the noun gâs, ‘position,’ occurs twice in close connection with the uncertain word, and is correctly spelt.

[^2]: (110:1) The Pahl. text is as follows:—‘Kâr-î madam zâkŏ-î levatman dên ku<i>s</i>n s<i>p</i>ar, vad <i>s</i><i>p</i>ôr kârîh zya<i>s</i> dên sâmân pa<i>d</i>a<i>s</i> ra<i>d</i>akîh.’

[^3]: (110:2) This unusual hybrid word is evidently intended as a Zvâri<i>s</i> equivalent of the Irânian zamânah, and is composed of vidanâ (= Ch. עִדָּנָא, which is the usual Zvâri<i>s</i> for zamân) + ânag (= ânah, the final syllables of zamânah). The central syllable of zamânah is, therefore, twice represented in the Zvâri<i>s</i> vidanâânag. The hybrid occurs again, in Bk. IX, Chap. XVII, 3, in a phrase where it can only mean ‘time, period.’ If it were not for this after-occurrence, the word here might be read va-dô-ahûg, ‘and the dual existence,’ with some degree of probability.

[^4]: (111:1) See Chap. XIII, 8 n, and compare the account of the seven special evil-doers in Dd. LXXII, 3-9.

[^5]: (111:2) The Av. a<i>z</i>i srvara of Yas. IX, 11 (W.), Yt. XIX, 40; a terrible serpent slain by Keresâspa the Sâman, as mentioned again in Bk. IX, Chap. XV, 2.

[^6]: (111:3) Also written Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh; he was one of the Tûrânian priesthood who persecuted Zaratû<i>s</i>t in his youth, and probably the same as Pers. Bartarûsh (the Brâ<i>d</i>ar-vakhsh of Sd. IX, 5) who is said to have killed Zaratû<i>s</i>t in the end. But, as he was one of five brothers, three of whose names were much alike (see Byt. II, 3 n), his identification is rather uncertain.

[^7]: (111:4) Av. karapan. In Dk. Bk. VII the Karaps are often mentioned p. 112 as enemies of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, both before and after his birth. Some are named, such as Dûrâsrôb, Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh, Vaêdvôi<i>s</i>t, and <i>G</i>êshmak. The Karap of the district where the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t was born banishes her for witchcraft, and must, therefore, have been the official head of the district. Dûrâsrôb, the Karap, travels sometimes with a disciple (hâvi<i>s</i>t), so his title was probably a priestly one. The Karap is also often mentioned with the Kaî, or Kîk (Av. kavan or kavi), the title of an equally obnoxious class; both Kîks and Karaps being termed ‘demon-worshippers,’ or idolators; and the Pahlavi translators of the Avesta speak of them, metaphorically, as ‘blind and deaf’ to the sacred beings.
