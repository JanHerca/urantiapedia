## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER VIII.

1\. The Ra<i>d</i>ŏ-dâ<i>d</i>\-aîtag [^4] _contains_ particulars _about_ the religious and important customs _and_ laws to be <span id="p20"><sup><small>[ p. 20 ]</small></sup></span> enforced. 2. The reason of the worthiness and superexcellence in a sacerdotal leader, _and his_ possession of a portion of the other authority (patîh) _of_ a ruler also; that is, how worthiness is to be distinguished from unworthiness, and superexcellence from unworthiness, in him, namely, in the priestly chieftainship (ra<i>d</i>îh) _of_ Khvanîras [^1] _and_ the other Legions, each separately, the first which stood aloof from the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers.

3\. About the demonstration _and_ notification of the sitting together of the archangels, the ritual and appliances in the ceremonial of the sacred beings, the position and business of the Zôtis _and_ Râspîs [^2] in a ceremonial, and also all the business _of_ the leaders in their duty, each separately _and_ originally [^3]. 4. The greatness of the helpfulness (vi<i>g</i>î<i>d</i>âr-dahi<i>s</i>nîh) in good works, the kinds of helpfulness, and the proximity _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to the thoughts, words, _and_ deeds _of_ the embodied existence.

5\. The excellence _of_ righteousness is perfect.

## Footnotes

[^4]: (19:4) Corresponding to the seventh word, <i>k</i>î<i>d</i>, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the eighth Nask in other Rivâyats. Ra<i>d</i>ŏ-dâ<i>d</i>\-aîtag means ‘concerning the habits of a priestly master,’ which is a fair description of the contents of this Nask, but it is misread Ratu<i>s</i>tâî, or Ratu<i>s</i>tâîd, in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained originally fifty kardah, or subdivisions, of which only thirteen were recovered after the time of Alexander.

[^1]: (20:1) Av. <i>H</i><i>v</i>aniratha, the central region of the earth, containing the countries best known to the Irânians, around which the other six smaller regions were supposed to be arranged.

[^2]: (20:2) See Chap. VII, 5.

[^3]: (20:3) Or ‘fundamentally’ (va<i>l</i> bûn).
