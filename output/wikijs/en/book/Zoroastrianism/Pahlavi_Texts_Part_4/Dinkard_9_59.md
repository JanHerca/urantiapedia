## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LIX.

_Bakŏ Nask_.

1\. The thirteenth fargar<i>d</i>, Ta<i>d</i>\-thwâ-peresâ [^1], is _that_ the obeisance [^2] of the archangels is performed by him who is educated in the recitation _for_ the archangels of _one_ learned in the religion, which is when _he has_ to understand the recitation and to maintain the recitation of revelation with propriety, which is when an enumeration, or form (âînakŏ), as to the qualities of the archangels exists, which is the obeisance _for_ the sacred beings. 2. For, on this subject, one mentions seven kinds _of men_ [^3], educated, or well-educated, or ill-educated, who are connected with it in statements by those of the world; the merely educated _man_, particularly also the physician, explains this which is not mentioned _and_ does not occur, that _it is_ well, or ill, disposed [^4]; the merely well-educated _man_, particularly also the physician, explains this which is mentioned _and_ occurs, that _it is_ well-disposed; the merely ill-educated _man, and_ <span id="p361"><sup><small>[ p. 361 ]</small></sup></span> also the physician, explains this which is mentioned _and_ occurs, that _it is_ ill-disposed; and the merely uneducated _man_ explains anything whatever that is really life [^5]. 3. _One_ educated in the recitation _for_ the sacred beings, who when—on account of the necessity of speaking evil about a learned man—_he_ is mischievous (anâg), so that he keeps in viciousness, _and has_ remained in the obeisance _for_ the sacred beings, is called not ransomed (la tâkhtîk). 4. _One_ ill-educated in the recitation _for_ the sacred beings, which is when _it happens_ that he keeps in viciousness, becomes even an apostate who is acquainted with the religion. 5. _One_ uneducated in what _pertains to_ the sacred beings is of two kinds, either good [^6] and void of learning, or an evil _one_ who is void of knowledge; the good _and_ void of learning worships the sacred beings unobservantly with the proper rites, and the evil _one_ who is void of knowledge thinks to worship the sacred beings un-observantly with improper rites, and _has_ no means of trustworthy reliance upon the religion of the sacred beings and their obeisance. 6. And _one_ well-educated in what _pertains to_ the sacred beings, through the three words of the connected series (ham-pa<i>d</i>vandi<i>s</i>nîh) which is good (khu) and learned [^7], and through what _pertains to_ the sacred beings, expounds faithfully the object of the obeisance _for_ the sacred beings.

7\. This, too, that, by him who teaches to mankind that thing which becomes their hope of eternity, mankind are taught to come to the religion of <span id="p362"><sup><small>[ p. 362 ]</small></sup></span> the sacred beings; even for this reason, because the Vohûmanic attainment [^8] to the religion of the sacred beings is to be required wisely for them, its requirement wisely for them is a benefit for the steadfast and becomes a consideration (mînîh) for them, and the consideration of the benefit of the steadfast is through hope of the eternity which is provided for the benefit, on account of which the hope of eternity—which is the basis—is the reason even of the acceptance of the religion.

8\. This, too, that the perfection of the first among the existences [^9] is taught by him who _has_ retentively remembered his words; even for this reason, because remembrance is the acme of every perfection. 9. This, too, that he becomes a nourisher of good works who shall perform good works publicly; even for this reason, because others are taught thereby, and good works increase in the world. 10. This, too, that by him who has fruit in the possession of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the development of the world in virtue [^10] is taught; even for this reason, because a lawful preserver and a producer of liberality arise through the fruit, they enlarge the root of the power of the angel _of_ liberality, and pluck _its_ fruit; the world is improved thereby, _and_ mankind are taught about _it_. 11. This, too, that, through complete mindfulness, words _and_ actions [^11] are truly taught by him whose ceremonial is for complete mindfulness; even for this reason, because there are both words _and_ actions in the ceremonial.

12\. This, too, that the sagacious creativeness (far’<i>z</i>ânak dahîh) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is taught, which is <span id="p363"><sup><small>[ p. 363 ]</small></sup></span> the exposition, to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^12], of the production of the renovation; even for this reason, because the advantage of the sagacity of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is the consequence of its beginning, and _its_ middle is through the power of the goodness and knowledge of him himself, and because _it is_ destiny as regards the creations; and whoever possesses that power for the assistance of the renovation, is extolled for that sagacity, and _people_ are taught thereby. 13. This, too, that the reward of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is appropriated by him who decides about duty and opinion [^13]; even for this reason, because, through that discrimination, _he is_ similar to Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

14\. This, too, that the recitation of revelation is performed _for_ mankind by him who extends the propagation of the religion [^14]; even for this reason, because, owing to the gratification of virtuous practisers, virtue increases. 15. This, too, that the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is made progressive [^13] by him who shall perform the ceremonial of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because through that performance of his occurs the blessing of the provider of the rite (nîrangînî<i>d</i>âr). 16. This, too, that that perfectly righteous _man_ of just judgment is protected from the annoying spirit [^15] by him who possesses the resemblance (ângûnagîh) unto Vohûman that they behold and resources through virtue; even for this reason, because the vexation which is partaken by him (_the spirit_), owing to the just judgment among those of the nature (<i>k</i>îharîkân) of mankind, is redoubled (dôkânî-aîtŏ) by their pleasure owing to the Vohûmanic resemblance, _and_ the annoying spirit <span id="p364"><sup><small>[ p. 364 ]</small></sup></span> is disabled (akârî-hênd) [^16] by that accumulated vexation _which_ occurs for his annoyance.

17\. This, too, that the exploits of the archangels are taught by him who is really capable in what _pertains to_ the archangels; even for this reason, because they become the hope of a consoling (vê<i>d</i>var) end, and are also indicative of the renovation _of the universe_, the hope of a virtuous end. 18. This, too, that the words of him who is Zaratû<i>s</i>t, that ‘_people_ shall become supplicant,’ are taught by him who is for the benefiters; even for this reason, _because_ they who are benefiters, on account of an inclination for the religion, make others eager for the religion, and make them mount for prayer. 19. And this, _too_, that by him who gives anything to a righteous man, this is also done that some one else _may_ give even to him who is vile; even for this reason, because a foundation of liberality is thereby prepared for him [^17].

20\. Perfect righteousness is excellence.
