## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XLVI.

1\. The Gâthas of the Ya<i>s</i>t [^1], as the first offspring of the Ahunavair, are a recitation of the source of sources of the religion, and in the compass (parvastârîh) [^2] _of_ the Gâthas, every word (mârîk) <span id="p170"><sup><small>[ p. 170 ]</small></sup></span> in it is the origin of a word. 2. The word ahû [^1] of the beginning [^2] is of a like kind with ahyâ [^3], the beginning of the Gâthas; the end word, which is vâstârem [^4], is _of a like kind_ with vahyô [^5], the end of the Gâthas; and the whole—which, though _its_ nature is _of_ one kind, is distributed (vakhtŏ) in _what is_ selected therefrom—is stored up (a<i>v</i>argû<i>d</i>ŏ) in _this_ compendium [^6] of all parts of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion.

3\. Likewise the purport (<i>a</i><i>v</i>orî-hastân) [^7] of its verse (gâh), and the particulars of the primitive Vîspêra<i>d</i> [^8] are to procure homage and praise, oblation _and_ invocation; _and_ the blessing [^9], which is regulated by the sagacity of the creator, is adapted for the spiritual illustration of the lodgment of the ceremonial of the sacred beings therein. 4. All <span id="p171"><sup><small>[ p. 171 ]</small></sup></span> three are provisions for the first _and_ last presentations [^1] which _one_ utters by means of the Stô<i>d</i> Ya<i>s</i>t.

5\. It is perfect _is_ the excellence of righteousness; it is perfect excellence _that is_ righteousness; with the copy revised (râyînî<i>d</i>ŏ).

## Footnotes

[^1]: (169:1) Corresponding to the twenty-first word, vâstârem, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the first Nask in other Rivâyats. In Chap. I, 9, 12 it is called Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t, ‘praise-ritual,’ (Av. staota yêsnya); and Stûd-ya<i>s</i>t, or Ya<i>s</i>t, in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contains thirty-three kardah, or ʓûrat. In Sls. XIII, 1 we are told that Vîsâi v<i>e</i>\-ameshâ-spe<i>n</i>tâ (Yas. XIV, 1) is the beginning of the Stôtân-yasnô; and, if we look for its end, we find Yas. LVIII, LIX both ending with special reverence of ‘the whole collection of the Stôtân-yasnân.’ We may therefore conclude that Yas. XIV-LIX, with its supplementary passages in Vîsp. V-XXIV, contains the whole of the Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t. But from this we must deduct Yas. XIX-XXI which are the first three fargar<i>d</i>s of the Bakŏ Nask, Yas. LII which is an interpolation, and Yas. LVI, LVII which are the Srôsh Ya<i>s</i>ts, lesser and greater; we must also consider the Yasna Haptanghâiti as a single section, in accordance with its treatment in Bk. IX, Chaps. XII, XXXV, LVII; and much of the Vîspêra<i>d</i> may not belong to the primitive text mentioned in § 3. Making these necessary deductions we have exactly thirty-three has of the Yasna left for the Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t, as stated in the Rivâyats.

[^2]: (169:2) This word can also be read fravistârîh (Av. fra + vid), ‘interpretation,’ or frôstârîh, ‘handing down.’

[^1]: (170:1) The Ahunavair begins with the words yathâ ahû vairyô. The word ahû, in the MS., is written ahî as usual in Irân.

[^2]: (170:2) Assuming that ba<i>r</i>â stands for bûn.

[^3]: (170:3) The first Gâtha, or sacred hymn, begins with the words ahyâ yâsâ nemanghâ (Yas. XXVIII, 1 a). There is, of course, no connection but that of sound between ahû, ‘a spiritual lord,’ and ahyâ, ‘of this;’ nor is there any other between the concluding words vâstârem, ‘a protector,’ and vahyô, ‘better,’ though the phrases in which these latter occur are of a very similar character, which fully justifies the comparison made in the text.

[^4]: (170:4) The Ahunavair ends with the words yim drigubyô dada<i>d</i> vâstârem.

[^5]: (170:5) The last Gâtha ends with the words yâ erezhe<i>g</i>yôi dâhî drigaovê vahyô (Yas. LIII, 9 d).

[^6]: (170:6) The Gâthas apparently.

[^7]: (170:7) Or <i>a</i><i>v</i>ar-gâstân, ‘disseminations.’

[^8]: (170:8) The Vîspêra<i>d</i> service consists of the Yasna ritual with certain additional passages intermixed, which passages are called the Vîspêra<i>d</i> because the earlier ones invoke ‘all the chiefs’ (vîspê ratavô, Visp. II, 3) of creation.

[^9]: (170:9) Possibly Yas. LV.

[^1]: (171:1) Probably referring to Yas. XIV and LVIII.
