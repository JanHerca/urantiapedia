## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VIII. CHAPTER XXVI.

_Ganabâ-sar-ni<i>g</i>a_d _Nask._

1\. The third section is the Aratê<i>s</i>târistân (‘_warrior code_’), particulars about the worthiness of destroying a wolf; _and_, among wolves, the greater need of destroying (zani<i>s</i>ntarîh) those with two legs than those with four legs.

2\. About selecting the daily _supplies_ of warriors, the beasts _of burden_, clothing, and equipment of warriors, and other appurtenances (<i>a</i><i>v</i>â_rî_gânakîh) which are to be given to them; _also_ selecting a horse _and_ accoutrements (zênŏ-<i>a</i>fzâr) _for_ each one. <span id="p87"><sup><small>[ p. 87 ]</small></sup></span> 3. About having a man's horse trained before _one_ sends _him_ to smite enemies. 4. About the efficacy of the resources _and_ care of a warrior in the destruction which enemies occasion; _also_ the army and the slaughter of war. 5. About the sin of the village and abode of the warriors on the occurrence of a battle, and what is the retribution for wounds and damage; what is that which is disfiguring (<i>a</i>pîrâyak) therein, and what is that which is worthy of death therein.

6\. About the characteristics of the wearing of armour (zênâvandîh) and not wearing of armour _by_ warriors. 7. About the rank of the general (sipâhpa<i>d</i>ŏ), _and_ other officers (pa<i>d</i>ân) over the troops, as to daily _supplies_, pay, and dignity; also their subordinates (a<i>z</i>îrag), and the number of troopers (gû<i>r</i>d) _to_ each one of the officers. 8. About the anxieties of a trooper for the protection of person and family. 9. About the number of troopers when the king of kings goes to battle. 10. About the proportion of daily provision for two warriors, the meat and milk and bread thereof, which are for the sake of providing guidance _and_ causing contests of the warriors in that good eating; also the reason _of_ certifying (gôvâîk) its distribution and weighing, the beast _of burden_ of the original village (bûn kôkîh) [^1], and _its_ means of _being_ sent unto the troops. 11. About cutting the herbs for the veterinary surgeon (stôr be<i>z</i>ashkŏ), the store of accoutrements, _and_ other things which are necessary with an army. 12. About the feeding of warriors _on_ the day of battle, the meat and whatsoever are their eatables; even so the food of the horses. <span id="p88"><sup><small>[ p. 88 ]</small></sup></span> 13\. About the wealth which foreigners bring away, and this which is declared thereof, that is, ‘I, too, _am_ assisting even the wolf.’ 14. About the display of esteem by warriors together, the union of friendship one with the other, obedient unto their commander of the troops, and mindfully resigning _them_selves to death, _there_ being seen a spiritual reward, without doubt, in the future existence.

15\. About the choice of a commander over the troops; also as to _his_ coming _and_ understanding the habits of his troops, each separately, through the capability of skill which is theirs. 16. About estimating the strength _and_ resources of the troops, with those of _their_ enemies; that is, how the battle is to be engaged in, _or_ how the _case_ is when it is to be avoided. 17. About the provision of anything requisite [^2] which warriors shall leave for safety when _there is_ danger in the neighbourhood from a distant stronghold, or danger to a neighbouring stronghold from afar. 18. About _the case_ where, when it is necessary to engage in battle, the horse of a warrior has not arrived, _and it_ is allowable to seize upon several horses from a herd of horses. 19. About the watchful sentinel (nigâhakŏ pâspânŏ), _and_ of what kind is the information from which this is manifest, to the army and commander of the troops, that the enemy is well dead, or fled.

20\. About a demonstration whereby they produce terror _and_ apprehension in the enemy. 21. About an altercation of the commander of the troops with foreigners before a battle; altercation also through an envoy, and calling them into subjection to the <span id="p89"><sup><small>[ p. 89 ]</small></sup></span> king of kings and the religion of the sacred beings. 22. About admonition to the troops, and declaring the share and arrangement of special duty of each one in the fight; announcing to the troops the recompense of the active, telling _and_ informing the troops _of_ the reason of being worthy of death, _of_ the worthiness of destroying foreigners, _of_ the command of the sacred beings as to their destruction when they shall not accept the Irânian nationality (Airîh), and the equally great reward _and_ recompense for their destruction announced by revelation, the legal code (dâ<i>d</i>istânîkîh) of Irân.

23\. About not uttering words of irritation on the day of battle, _and_ not mentioning, among the troops, any intelligence which gives the troops apprehension, but _only_ that which is agreeable and pleasing, through giving heartiness and increasing the strength. 24. About the _sacred_ ceremonial on the day of battle _and_ evil deeds of war;—a twig of the sacred twigs of that ceremonial, and the Avesta as regards fighting, _being_ the first arrow well delivered into the mark shot _at_;—the consecration of the water which is nearest to the place of battle, even by bringing holy-water; and the sequence of the fight, that is, with which arms _and_ appliances _it_ is first to be fought, _and_ successively unto those which _are_ the last.

25\. About the proportion of those who keep the arms (zâ<i>ê</i>) for the combatants, and, after a victory over foreigners, are taking away the hostages and captives, out of the foreigners, from the combatants; _also their_ return from them. 26. At what degree of distance from them _they have_ to carry the arms _and_ appliances and the restoratives for the unfatigued <span id="p90"><sup><small>[ p. 90 ]</small></sup></span> and the fatigued; and, the accoutrements _being_ deposited, a warm bath prepared, and relaxation of the body effected, the reward of merit is given. 27. _One has_ to search offenders, to bring restoratives for the unfatigued and the fatigued, to deliver the accoutrements back to the arsenal (gan<i>g</i>ŏ), to allot the share of the hostage brought back to his own _people_, and also much else on the same subject.
