## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER IV.

_Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask_.

1\. The third fargar<i>d</i>, YêNhê-hâtãm [^3], is about <span id="p176"><sup><small>[ p. 176 ]</small></sup></span> the formation of mankind by slow increase, and, when they live on _for_ fifty [^1] years, _their_ slowly becoming dust; the coming of death even _to_ him who is very pleasantly living, as regards mankind, at the climax (barînŏ) of his life; and the happiness of the worldly _existence_ is given only to the worthy, on account of _their_ love of righteousness; the rest are passed by [^2]. 2. And also this, that he who is produced by the demons, _or_ is proceeding to the <span id="p177"><sup><small>[ p. 177 ]</small></sup></span> demons, _or_ has committed falsehood, is the opulent person who gives nothing to a worthy supplicant.

3\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

## Footnotes

[^3]: (175:3) This third formula is chiefly recited at the end of most of the hâs in the Yasna, and consists of fifteen Avesta words, as follows:—
  YêNhê hâtãm âa<i>d</i>, yêsnê paitî, vanghô
  mazd<i>a</i>u ahurô vaêthâ, ashâ<i>d</i> ha<i>k</i>â,
  y<i>a</i>unghãm<i>k</i>â, tãs<i>k</i>â t<i>a</i>us<i>k</i>â yazamaidê.
  This may be translated as follows:—‘Of whatever male of the p. 176 existences, therefore, Ahuramazda was better cognizant, through righteousness in worship, and of whatever females, both those males and those females we reverence.’
  The Pahlavi version explains it as follows:—‘Whoever of those existing is thus in worship as regards a good _being_ \[that is, shall celebrate a ceremonial for that good _being_ who is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the lord\], Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is aware of _it_, owing to the accompaniment of righteousness \[_and being_ acquainted with the reward and recompense of whatever are, severally, the duty and good works that any one has performed, he grants _them_\]. I reverence those of the assembly, males and females \[the archangels; because the male _of_ them are good, and the female _of_ them\].’
  The Pahlavi translator evidently read vanghô in the first line of the text, as printed above, and not in the second, as in the present MSS.

[^1]: (176:1) So in K, but B has ‘seventy.’ The text seems to allude to the beginning of old age, of which three grades are mentioned in the Avesta (Vend. III, 19, 20): the hanô, zaururô, and pairi<i>s</i>tâkhshudrô. The Pahlavi version defines the age of each grade, but the ciphers given are corrupted in the MSS. extant. The Far. Oîm, p. 5, ll. 9, 10, gives fifty years as the age of the zarmân (Av. zaururô), seventy years as that of the hân (Av. hanô), and ninety years as that of the pâ<i>d</i>îrânŏ-shûsar (Av. pairi<i>s</i>tâkhshudrô); but whether this arrangement of the ages is compatible with the different order of these epithets in the Avesta is doubtful, though it shows that old age was considered to begin at the age of fifty years.

[^2]: (176:2) Reading sa<i>k</i>î-aîtŏ according to K, though the word can also be read se<i>g</i>î-aîtŏ, ‘are ruined;’ in B it can be read gadâîgî-aîtŏ, ‘are impoverished.’
