## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER LXIX.

1\. About a selection from the whole Ya<i>s</i>t [^1] referring to the developer (vakhshînî<i>d</i>âr-hômônd).

2\. Those are beneficial who increase for the developer, that is, they shall occasion benefit (nêvakîh) for him who would occasion that benefit which is for others [^2]. 3. Thus the righteous _man_ who produces perfect thought is _he_ who comes upon it through Vohûman [^3], _and_ the benefit of him who is an open annoyer [^4]—the righteous man who is a smiter _of_ the wicked, _and_ who developes as to what is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s and as to what is Zaratû<i>s</i>t's—is that he slays in moderation.

4\. Regarding him who is an oppressive man who is righteous, the reply spoken is _thus:_ ‘The reward of the smiter and developer—that man of whom _one_ <span id="p385"><sup><small>[ p. 385 ]</small></sup></span> knows the smiting and developing—is the very evil reward _of_ him who is wicked; just as his smiting, as an evil reward for him from those two spirits, is that very evil practice loved by him who is wicked; even for this reason every righteous individual is Gâthic [^5], because, when privileged (pa<i>d</i>ôkhshâî), he who is wicked is thus he _who_ is righteous, _and_ also he who is privileged is unprivileged [^6].’

5\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t proceeded with the smiting at the wicked, _and_ as to that proceeding Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Thou shouldst thus proceed with smiting at the wicked by ordinance (dâ<i>d</i>istân), because thus they have thee and the righteous of every kind as ruler. 6. Also through my decree (pavan-i<i>k</i> man vi<i>g</i>îr) _one_ produces the ritual of ordeal, which realizes that which is real, so that _one_ may make that which is dark fully light. 7. Thine, too, is so much the sovereignty of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, thus through worship, that its requisite (khvâstakŏ) privilege is thus maintained through virtue, because thou, who _art_ thus, _art_ more unconfined (anâkô<i>s</i>î<i>d</i>ar) to the world through the furtherance _and_ development of righteousness; great, indeed, is he who trusts the righteous _man_ for righteousness, and great is he who _trusts_ the wicked _man_ for wickedness.’

8\. As to that utterance (farmâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘An open annoyer is the righteous man—the benefiter disclosed _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>—that loves the embodied world of righteousness, and demands its reverence (tarsakâyîh) for the proportion of righteousness therein, that is, he knows the proportion of duty and good works.’ 9. Regarding <span id="p386"><sup><small>[ p. 386 ]</small></sup></span> the worldly _existence_, the reply spoken is thus: ‘That which is again contaminated (gûmîkhtê<i>d</i>) _by_ the demons becomes abundant so long as that which is proper is again contaminated with the demons; _and_, so long as _there is_ a developer, they subsist for their own substances, so that _it_ is possible for them to seek benefit for their own, _and_ they are smiters of the righteous.’

10\. Regarding him who is a wise smiter, Sôshâns [^7] spoke _in_ reply thus: ‘It arises through his way when it is again contaminated.’

11\. As to that mischief (drû<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Happy is he from whom there is no mischief.’ 12. Regarding [^8] him who has come, the Yim of splendour [^9], he spoke thus: ‘He attains his reward who is no smiter and no developer, not privileged and not unprivileged.’

13\. As to that disclosure (h<i>â</i><i>k</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) Vohûman [^10] spoke thus: ‘I aggrandize that spiritual lord and that priestly master who is my righteousness in person.’

14\. As to that utterance Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^10] spoke thus: ‘So do thou perfect (ba<i>r</i>â vadîdûn) him whose information subsists—a man that becomes wise—who is as an emblem of my religion; because he _has_ worshipped that which is ours, so that he has retained property in our possession, through whose words _there_ is a furtherance of the world of righteousness. 15. That is my arrangement, and that my wish—that is, what is necessary for me—and I <span id="p387"><sup><small>[ p. 387 ]</small></sup></span> love that which thou fully understandest, that is, that arrangement which is righteousness; also whatever discourse and perfect performance, thou askest of us, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! in complete mindfulness, I now practise by the work of each hand; observe thoroughly that which I _am_ performing, _and_ thou, too, _art_ accomplishing. 16. In worship thou, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! art liberal, who art liberal in ceremonial; _for_ thee, whose body believes, controversy is not lavish (râ<i>d</i>) for the sake of the wealth bestowed; the reward of Zaratû<i>s</i>t the developer is for developing, the reward of Zaratû<i>s</i>t the smiter is for smiting, _and_ the reward of Zaratû<i>s</i>t the smiter and developer is for smiting and developing. 17. At the bridge _judgment_ of him whose name the fire calls for participation, as when they repeatedly pour the melted ore upon him in the throat, thou shouldst pray near him alive—him whose love is for virtue—so that he may perform duty and good works with fearlessness; with his desire, too, it is expedient to know that _it is_ done by him on account of necessity.’

18\. As to that utterance Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Such is the upward attraction (lâlâ-han<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nîh) of Shatraver [^11] for him who is ours.’ 19. As to that question (frashnŏ) Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: Such has happened to him who is ours through Vohûman; he ought to come to our religion through virtue. 20. Truly he, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! is privileged for the sovereignty, who confines _his_ ears _to_ this religion, that he may make _it_ fully progressive; who is given immortality through this, and kind regard _for_ the will _of_ him _who_ is the best of that religion of mine, <span id="p388"><sup><small>[ p. 388 ]</small></sup></span> <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _and_ who assists the furtherance of this world of mine in righteousness.'

21\. As to those of that _other one_ [^12] Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘As regards that which is great evidence, when wicked they consider _it_ as unattested for him who is wicked himself; _and_ the thoughts [^13] of him, whose deeds are those of that _other one_, are due to Akômanô [^14]. 22. Owing also to this, when both Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> and Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^15] are given to thee, _it is_ in that way—when thou art of the propitious spirit and the best thought—that what thou understandest thou shouldst be accomplishing, and what thou dost not understand thou askest again.’

23\. Of him whose wisdom exists (aîtŏ)—of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>—he whose wisdom arises (yehevûnê<i>d</i>)—Zaratû<i>s</i>t—enquired concerning him who is unreal (an-aîtŏ) _and_ who does not subsist (yehevûnê<i>d</i>) _here_after, who _has_ thus never become a material _existence_ for those _on_ the side of virtue, and does not subsist for them henceforth.

24\. As to that reverse description (pa<i>d</i>îrakŏ-nisâni<i>s</i>nîh) Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Among men of every kind say unto the righteous who are smiting the wicked, _that_ we improve the measure of any milk they propitiate, even by the holy-water which is the sustenance (bari<i>s</i>nŏ) of milk, _in order_ to cause much happiness of life.’

25\. As to that utterance Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'Happy is he from whom there is no complaint, and a life which is like this the text Gerezôi . . . <span id="p389"><sup><small>[ p. 389 ]</small></sup></span> âkhsô . . . [^16] implores. 26. To thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! my protection is given _in_ the reply of the K<i>e</i>m-nâ [^17] which, before the companionship of Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^18]—that righteous friend of mine [^19]—_was_ a published thing of those which are used, _and_ of those such as it is requisite to use. 27. The talk of a man which is immoderate is false, everything immoderate is _so_ for this reason, everything is not that which the good man possesses, because, when privileged, the wicked _one_ is he who is righteous, and he who is privileged becomes unprivileged; he who is righteous is thus he who is wicked, and becomes him who is privileged and unprivileged, so that he is fully incriminated, and they shall carry off his possessions.' <span id="p390"><sup><small>[ p. 390 ]</small></sup></span> 28\. Regarding the benefiters the reply spoken is _thus:_ ‘They are owing to the reward of the smiter and developer; those are beneficial whose smiting and developing are those of the developer Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, who understands smiting and development.’

29\. When through smiting by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, on account of the wicked, a question (frashnŏ) about _it_ arose, the reply spoken, as to the smiting of the present _world_ by means of him who is ruler, _was:_ ‘The reward which the judgment that is perfect teaches is thus, that he who is the smiter and developer, Sôshâns [^20], shall make the decision.’ 30. Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke _in_ reply thus: ‘He gives a reward.’ 31. And that wise smiter, Sôshâns, spoke _in_ reply thus: ‘He shall inflict punishment.’

32\. Even he who is an ox of many cattle has openly _and_ publicly wailed this complaint [^21] on account of the righteous _one:_ ‘How long _is it_ till _the time_ when a developer arises, even he who is an irresolute ruler (akâmakŏ khû<i>d</i>âî)? How long is the time till he arises, until the wicked _one_ who is a smiter _and_ privileged corrupter is he _who is_ unprivileged?’ 33. Because, for the sake of producing resolution (kâmak-dahîh), he complains that, until the developer shall arise, even he who is irresolute is ruler, that is, until he who is the developer shall become privileged.

34\. As to that complaint of his Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Not so as by this complaint is the obtainment of spiritual lordship (ahûîkih), for this reason, when they do not consider the ruler as a ruler, and _there is_ no giving of priestly authority (ra<i>d</i>ŏîh) by any <span id="p391"><sup><small>[ p. 391 ]</small></sup></span> righteousness whatever [^22], it is requisite, on account of the many righteous, to speak henceforth, until _the time_ when the developer arises, even _of_ him who is an irresolute ruler.’

35\. On account of the many statements of the spirits, even as to thought, word, _and_ deed, it is requisite to say that they shall always render an account until even some obtainment _of_ a smiter and developer, privileged _or_ unprivileged. 36. Some arise _of_ whom it is requisite to ask this question (frashnŏ) [^23] while he who is righteous _and_ he who is wicked are two witnesses, _and_ they make the righteous _one_ manifest by his evidence, _or_ they molest him who is righteous by smiting. 37. Some arise when it is requisite to speak this reply [^24] during the smiting _of_ the maintainer of strife and _of_ the kinsman. 38. _And_ some arise while that individual [^25] is loved, though a righteous _one and_ a developer arise, and it is requisite to produce a provider of benefit on account of the many, both wicked and righteous, so long as a wicked _one_ of the smiting which is maintaining strife is privileged.

39\. Because, regarding the production of resolution, _it_ is proclaimed that _it is_ so that they shall fully understand that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> discriminates truly, _and_ Aharman does not discriminate truly. 40. And that _it is_ so that they shall fully understand that the punishment of the wicked is for teaching _them_ that they _will_ attain to the existence of darkness, that even _to_ him who belongs to the ever-stationary they _may_ give his reward, that they are for smiting the wicked _one_, that they are very powerful to give, that <span id="p392"><sup><small>[ p. 392 ]</small></sup></span> they _should_ kill the apostate, that _one has to be_ converted from vileness to goodness, that he who would be wicked is made to believe by the tongue, that for the sake of proper nurture of the creatures next-of-kin marriage is provided, that the demons are despised, that thus he who is evil-ruling is wicked, and that they are approaching _the place_ where Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> shall provide for the account of sin and good works.

41\. They shall become more diligent in the performance of duty and good works, and abstain more from sin, always until _one_ attains even to some acquirement _for_ those in life and those in a lifeless state [^26]. 42. And they shall not inflict their punishment completely in the embodied state, and the fiend does not pity the worldly _existence_; every individual is counted up, and every one is fully completed for the affairs of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _but_ the fiend is not smitten, and they shall not fully inflict the punishment.

43\. No one thinks thou shouldst remain for the propitious Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and no one completely presents _him_self; they attack through the fiend, and arise for the foolish _one_. 44. No one arises for the goodness of him who is good, _but_ for the vileness _of_ the fiend they destroy _what is_ good, and do not understand evil _and_ good; they recite the revelation for a wicked _one_, they do not bestow friendship for labour, _but_ are for the evil-doer.

45\. And the righteous _one_, who is the best of spiritual _and_ worldly _existences_, becomes a privileged <span id="p393"><sup><small>[ p. 393 ]</small></sup></span> developer, even he who is an irresolute ruler [^27]; and so he who is wicked, even he who is privileged, becomes unprivileged, at that time when _one_ gives the soul of every one unto the supreme heaven [^28], and when thou shouldst, every one, know that the affliction of the annoyers arises [^29], so that when, owing thereto, they beseech the sacred beings, _it is_ only hell that they supply.

46\. When every one shall provide the ceremonial of the archangels unworriedly, and when every one knows that Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan complained [^30]—so that he who is the fashioner of cattle enquired thus: ‘Whose is the guardianship of cattle [^31]?’ _and_ ‘Not without annoyance’ _was_ the reply of Ashavahi<i>s</i>t, ‘that is, they shall inflict his punishment [^32]’—every one _also_ knows that in their light is joyfulness for the sight [^33].

47\. When every individual (ko<i>l</i>â aî<i>s</i>\-1) becomes aware _of_ the priestly authority of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and when every individual knows that his remedy _for_ the devastation owing to the evil spirit is comprehensibly stated [^34]; when every individual knows that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> fashioned the propitiousness in the liturgy [^35]; and when every one knows that the priest is perfect, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> enhances both of them in spirituality [^36], that Vohûman is the offspring of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^37], that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s own [^38], that all three of them are the life _of_ him who <span id="p394"><sup><small>[ p. 394 ]</small></sup></span> _has_ wandered forth [^39]—that is, life is given by the thought and wisdom [^40] which are his own—and that the sacred beings are they who are supporting _it_.

48\. When every one of this existence must act for the sake of that _other_ existence, _and_ knows _how_ to act; when every one is a friend, through deeds, of the spirit which is his own [^41]; and when every one becomes a person supporting Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^42]. 49. When every individual knows that they give no reward to him in whose body a demon is lodging who is not listening [^43]; when every one shall make his own soul immortal [^44]; and when every one has advantage through possession of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^45].

50\. When every one becomes a Zôti unsullied in righteousness [^46]; when every one gives a sacred cake to the archangels [^47]; when every one knows that co-operation is due to him who is their servant; and when they are together _in_ soul [^48]. 51. When every individual gives _his_ body [^49]; when every one proceeds to their ceremonial and glorification [^50]; when every individual knows that ‘other than they’ is _meant by_ naê<i>k</i>îm t<i>e</i>m any<i>e</i>m [^51]; and when every one knows <span id="p395"><sup><small>[ p. 395 ]</small></sup></span> that, through that sovereignty of his, the renovation _of the universe_ is produced by _his_ will among the existences [^52].

52\. When every one knows the elucidation (rôshanŏ) of the religion; when every one considers the religion as governor and serf [^53]; when every one knows that the manifestation of this ought to arise in him; when every one thinks Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> auspicious [^54]; and when every one knows that, when it occurs, benefit is produced, through resolute sovereignty [^55], where and when it gives him a reward for the performance of the duty and good works they should call for. 53. When every one gives [^56] the sacred beings _and_ the good a sheep; when every one knows that, for him whose righteousness is in action, immense _and_ complete mindfulness arises [^57]; when every one thinks of much assistance from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^58]; when every one speaks to restore _his_ temper [^59]; when every one speaks to provide the ceremonial [^60]; and when every one produces that advantage by liberal giving [^61]. 54. When every one knows that _one_ grants him the obeisance which is _due to_ him when in a condition for the supreme heaven (amat dên garô<i>d</i>mânîkîh) [^62]; when every one knows that _it_ is done by those in the realm of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^63]; and when every individual knows <span id="p396"><sup><small>[ p. 396 ]</small></sup></span> that, so long as the religion of the first creation [^64] shall exist (ae), this characteristic is to be considered thus: Hvô zî dregv<i>a</i>u, &c. [^65]

55\. When every individual keeps no wealth for a high-priest of the apostates [^66]; when every one knows that, when above, _there_ is righteousness [^67]; when they shall make intercession [^68] _for_ every individual, and when every individual becomes aware [^69] _of it;_ when every individual sees that he is a father of righteousness [^70]; and when every individual knows that the propitious spirit is in him [^71]. 56. When every one knows that, when a supplicant, he is more a smiter of the wicked [^72]; when every individual utters the salutation (nîyâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^73]; when every individual knows that that is our comfort [^74], _and_ that it is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s own creature [^75]; and when every individual is taught [^76], _and_ every individual joins in the perfect religion [^77].

57\. When every individual knows that Vohûman <span id="p397"><sup><small>[ p. 397 ]</small></sup></span> guards the creatures [^78]; when every individual becomes privileged by will [^79] for the reward; when every individual knows that gain is through giving away [^80]; when every individual transacts, _or_ shall transact, the affairs of the archangels [^81]; and when every individual knows that when he who is intelligent speaks to him [^82], it becomes a possession for the benefit of righteousness [^83].

58\. When, for equal meritoriousness, it is necessary to give sooner to Magian men [^84]—so that on account even of the Magianship of Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp _he was_ suitable for the sovereignty [^85], that Zaratû<i>s</i>t was given a wife by Frashô<i>s</i>tar [^86], that _it was_ the learned <i>G</i>âmâsp [^87] that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> gave—and that every individual shall provide the ceremonial of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^88]. 59. And when every individual knows that _they are_ the best prayers which are the words of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^89], and, even so, his is a wise reward for those which are yours [^90].

60\. It is perfect _is_ the excellence of righteousness; it is perfect excellence _that is_ righteousness.
