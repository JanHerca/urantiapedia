## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XLI.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. The eighteenth fargar<i>d</i>, Yêzî [^2], is about the existence of certain and doubtful evidence _and_ indication as to the future existence [^3] arising. 2. About the great dignity _of_ the spirit of good works, _and_ that also of the person doing good works through the lodgment of that spirit in him. 3. This, too, that they praise, recount, and practise the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship at the time of the renovation _of the universe_, that of which the demons through deceitfulness, and then also wicked mankind deceived by those who are demons, _have_ said that it does not occur [^4]. <span id="p285"><sup><small>[ p. 285 ]</small></sup></span> 4\. About the triumph of the sacred beings over the demons at the end of _various_ periods. 5. First, that which _occurs_ when, on account of the preservation of mankind from hell, they praise the religion _of_ Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship; _and_ that which _occurs_ when Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân, _whose_ guardian spirit is reverenced, came to the obedient king Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^1]. 6. Second, when the power and triumph of renewed sovereignty are again connected with the religion, and mankind, on that account, return to the good religion; and this occurs on the near approach _of_ Aûshê<i>d</i>ar [^2], son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, when the righteous <i>K</i>itrag-miyân [^3] arrives. 7. Third, when mankind contentedly praise the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, and this occurs as Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh [^4], son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, arrives. 8. _And_ fourth, that which _occurs_ when every one shall practise the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship with eagerness; _at_ that time arrives the beneficial _and_ triumphant producer of the renovation, Sôshâns [^5], son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; _and_ this becomes the consummation (sar-hômôndîh) _and_ supreme triumph of the sacred beings.

9\. About enquiring of him who is acquainted with religion _and_ a wise priest _concerning_ the religion, and hearing _of it_ from him [^6]; also well understanding _it_ through wisdom. 10. About abstaining <span id="p286"><sup><small>[ p. 286 ]</small></sup></span> from the secret proceedings (nihân-hômôndîh) _of_ a deceitful _and_ seductive apostate [^1]. 11. This, too, _is said_, namely: ‘Thou shouldst also not fall into the downcast imprisonment (nikûn alakîh) through the teaching they deceive, where they thus mislead thee to the downcast imprisonment which is hell.’

12\. About mankind attaining to the wisdom of an angel (yêdatô dânôgîh) [^2] through the grades of intellect, ability, _and_ religion. 13. This, too, _is said_, namely: ‘It is for that way when mankind cause the disturbance (<i>s</i>iklinênd) _of_ that which is a vile religion for want of a way, when even this is produced from among the creatures, in which is the opening of a passage _for_ mankind to him, where the evil spirit is dwelling _and_ making thee surrender, and on account of the stupefying Akômanô [^3].’ 14. This, too, that, through the sovereignty of sagacity, every one _at_ last arrives at that way. 15. And this, too, that _by him_, who shall persistently perform good works or sin _with_ fearlessness, _it is_ to be hereupon considered that his performance is mindful [^4], _and_ that the best thing _for_ mankind, after birth, is purification from sin [^5].

16\. This, too, that the food _and_ maintenance of the priests _depend_ upon the husbandmen [^6]. 17. This, too, that coveted is now the pleasure and strength of mankind due to the cattle of Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> _and_ <span id="p287"><sup><small>[ p. 287 ]</small></sup></span> Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^1]. 18. About the oppressiveness _of_ Wrath and Envy, _and_ the destruction of both through complete mindfulness and possession of Good Thought [^2]. 19. _And_ this _is said_, namely: 'I made the religion of righteousness a combining desire (vôyak-î hâm-dahi<i>s</i>nŏ [^3]), and all mankind's own selves _are_ to be forced into that desire; also its involuntary seeking of immortality is the reign of the will of all mankind, and advantage always arises from it [^4].' 20. This, too, that the care of cattle is reverence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^5].

21\. About the progress [^6] of righteousness _there_ is this, too, that that greatness [^6] is generated therefrom, and its seekers—who are human beings—_have_ demanded the supreme predominance in the best existence. 22. About the praise of the period of the renovation _of the universe there_ is this, too, that, at that time, those who are doubtful about it are all disclosed to publicity [^7]; _also_ the last reward and bridge _judgment_ of the worthy. 23. About the lawfulness of that which _occurs_ through the destruction by Vohûman [^8], who is himself the spiritual lord of the arrangement, _there_ is this, too, that the wicked, <span id="p288"><sup><small>[ p. 288 ]</small></sup></span> _at_ that time, become aware of their own wickedness, when their bodies are dissipated. 24. About the destruction of the good works of the wicked, also that of their own souls, that of _their_ spiritual existences, and that of _their_ material bodies [^1]. 25. And this, too, that at the time of the renovation _of the universe_ occurs the approach _of_ the wisdom of our sovereignty to that of the best of mankind, and that glory is put on by it through which the destruction _of_ the bad and the development of the good arise; _also_ the sagacity which _exists_ in Vohûman extends to those who are its friends [^2].

26\. This, too, that _there_ are those who are extenders of the days, and they are beneficial in the country [^3]; and their custom, where they have arisen, is an opponent of him who is a wrathful person [^4]. 27. And this, too, that they shall thereupon excite (lâlâ vadîdûnâñd) a brother _and_ sister with mutual desire, so that they shall form a next-of-kin marriage with unanimity; and before midday they generate a sublime radiance, centred in the face, _and_ trembling passion [^5], and they _make_ the radiance grow up, openly manifest, to an altitude of the height of three spears of the length _of_ three reeds _each_ [^6]; and <span id="p289"><sup><small>[ p. 289 ]</small></sup></span> after midday they have learnt expulsion (rânakîh) [1](sbe37091_htm.html), _and_ shall remove the fiend who _was_ before a destroyer. 28. About _those who_ girdle themselves where they shall perform _their_ proper duty, and are thus all-beneficent for _being_ seen.

29\. Perfect is the excellence _of_ righteousness.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (284:2) See Chap. XVIII, 1 n; it is here called the 19th fargar<i>d</i> by mistake in the MS.

[^3]: (284:3) See Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 1 a.

[^4]: (284:4) Ibid. 1 b.

[^1]: (285:1) See Bk. VIII, Chaps. XI; 1, XIII, 15.

[^2]: (285:2) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIV, 12.

[^3]: (285:3) A title of Pêshyôtanû, son of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, who remains immortal as chief high-priest of Kangd<i>e</i><i>z</i>, whence he is expected to come to restore the religious rites in Irân and the rest of the world (see Bd. XXIX, 5, Byt. III, 23-32, 36-38, 41, 42, 51, 52).

[^4]: (285:4) See Bk. VIII, Chap. XIV, 13.

[^5]: (285:5) Ibid. 14.

[^6]: (285:6) See Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 3 a, b.

[^1]: (286:1) See Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 3 c.

[^2]: (286:2) The use of ô for â sometimes occurs in MSS. from Irân. The word can also be read shavandagîh, ‘existence,’ but this meaning is less likely.

[^3]: (286:3) See Bk. VIII, Chap. IX, 3 n.

[^4]: (286:4) See Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 4 c.

[^5]: (286:5) Ibid. 5 c.

[^6]: (286:6) Ibid. 5 d.

[^1]: (287:1) See Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 6 a, b; also Chap. XIX, 1.

[^2]: (287:2) Ibid. 7a, b.

[^3]: (287:3) Ibid. 7 c, where, however, this last word can be read asamîni<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘unalarming’ (asahamîni<i>s</i>nŏ in Pt4, Mf4), and the corresponding word in Pahl. Yas. XXXIV, 10 b can be read asami<i>s</i>nŏ, ‘intrepid;’ but, as these meanings are difficult to reconcile with those of the original Av. hithao<i>s</i>, hithãm, it seems more probable that the first syllables asam or asaham, should be read hisam or hisâm, a mere transcript of Av. hithãm.

[^4]: (287:4) Ibid. 8 a.

[^5]: (287:5) Ibid. 8 b.

[^6]: (287:6) Perhaps these two words, rûbâkîh, ‘progress,’ and rabâîh, ‘greatness,’ should be alike, but it is doubtful which is correct.

[^7]: (287:7) See Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 9 b.

[^8]: (287:8) Ibid. 9 c.

[^1]: (288:1) See Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 11 c.

[^2]: (288:2) Ibid. 11 d.

[^3]: (288:3) Ibid. 52 a.

[^4]: (288:4) Ibid. 52 d.

[^5]: (288:5) Reading as follows:—lâlâ zerkhûnd rôshanô pavan mîyân rôd bûland navêndakŏ khrôs, but some of the words can be read otherwise, as in S.B.E., vol. xviii, p. 395, or with further variations; and it is doubtful if the verb is to be construed with the words that follow it, contrary to the usual Pahlavi rule, as there is no other trace of Avesta construction in this section. Neither the Avesta, nor the Pahlavi, version of this chapter of the Gâthas makes any allusion to the subjects mentioned in §§ 27, 28.

[^6]: (288:6) It appears from Dd. XLIII, 5 that this total of nine reeds would be about forty-eight human feet of fourteen finger-breadths p. 289 (see Farh. Oîm, p. 41, l. 1), or 10½ inches, each; so that the height here mentioned would be about forty-two English feet.
