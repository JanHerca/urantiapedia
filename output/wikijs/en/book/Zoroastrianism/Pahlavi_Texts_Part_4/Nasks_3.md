## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK III. CHAPTER VII [^1].

The ninth question.

1\. Another apostate enquired thus: ‘When there is Mãthra that is said _to be_ all in the words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _whether_ it be in the words of Frashô<i>s</i>tar _and_ <i>G</i>âmâsp [^2], _or_ be in the words of Vohûman [^3] and the sacred beings, _or_ be in words of theirs published before _the time of_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _or_ even after _that of_ <i>S</i>ênô [^4], is _it to be_ considered _by_ us, as to that which is relating to us, _that_ what is the utterance of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t is only the Gâthic, and the rest is composed _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t and his disciples from the world, even statements due to a good inclination for conversion (va<i>s</i>takîh)?’

2\. The reply is _that_ the other Mãthra which is separate from the Gâthas, if it _be apart_ from the Gâthas, is _still_ owing to the composition of the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^5]; _and_ the same separate Mãthra, which is from a witness about _it_, is the evidence with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> himself in vigorous omniscience and composition, and not owing to the knowledge of mankind, which shall not attain even to an atom of the atoms thereof. 3. The arising of the Mãthra, through the speaking of many voices, is not all the speaking of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t through those <span id="p407"><sup><small>[ p. 407 ]</small></sup></span> voices, but the speaking of several separately, through which the speaking of the voice would be evidently _that of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; that is this Mãthra. 4. _And_ just as the speaking forth of Zaratû<i>s</i>t and other good _men_, as well as evil _ones_, likewise _of_ those who are demons, even as far as the evil spirit, is stated by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> in public, that statement would become even that of the evil spirit and demons, _and_ the Mãthra and Law against the demons _would_ likewise _become_ spoken _by_ the demons. 5. And the Mãthra is all _confided by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t through many voices, _being_ an avowal of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and an existence which is not inconsistent (han-bêshin); just as the Gâthas, which even you _admit to be_, as a whole, _confided by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, are spoken through the voice of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, be they through the voices of the archangels, be they through the voice of Gô<i>s</i>\-aûrvan [^6], _or_ be they _through_ the voices of other sacred beings, to all _they_ are spoken _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ are not inconsistent. 6. But owing to the disposition of an apostate _there_ is a longing scrutiny about his own _statements, and_ evil-thinking scrutiny about the statements protecting the spiritual lord.
