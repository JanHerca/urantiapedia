## FROM THE SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1].

1\. About the three divisions of revelation there is a condensed medium, beneficial _and_ small, of whose subdivision one category (ra<i>g</i>istakô) is collection together; that is, the Ahunavair [^2] itself is a symbol of the Nasks.

2\. First, the Ahunavair is apportioned into its three degrees (pa<i>d</i>mân), as shown in another chapter; _and_ by a like system (ra<i>g</i>istak) the Gâthas [^3], too, are into three, which are the three-lined, four-lined, and five-lined [^4]; even so the Nasks <span id="p402"><sup><small>[ p. 402 ]</small></sup></span> are denominated Gâthic, Hadha-mãthric, and Law. 3. Then the Ahunavair is apportioned into six which they call half-lines (nêm-gâs); so, too, the Gâthas are into six, which are called the Ahunavaiti Gâtha, the Yasna, the U<i>s</i>tavaiti [^5] Gâtha, the Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû (S<i>p</i>etamatŏ) Gâtha, the Vohû-khshathra Gâtha, _and_ the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti Gâtha; even so the Nasks are into six, as the Gâthas are into two, which are called one the Gâthic creation—_which_ is the Yast [^6]—_and_ one the rest _of_ the Gâthic; also the Hadha-mãthric into two, one the Mãthra of the arranger—which is the P<i>â</i><i>k</i>înŏ and Ra<i>d</i>ŏ-dâ<i>d</i>ŏ-aîtŏ [^7]—and one the Mãthra full of good tokens, which is the rest _of_ the Hadha-mãthra; and also the Law into two, one the law against the demons—which is the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> [^8]—and one the law of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _which_ is the rest _of_ the Law. 4. Then it is apportioned into twenty-one, such as the twenty-one words (mârîk) of the Ahunavair; _also_ the Gâthas are _into_ twenty-one, which are the Ahunavair, the praise of righteousness, the performance of the good, _and_ from Yânîm-manô unto Airyaman [^9] which, _being_ <span id="p403"><sup><small>[ p. 403 ]</small></sup></span> accomplished (âka<i>r</i><i>d</i>ŏ), are twenty-one; and the Nasks are twenty-one.

5\. Then the Gâthas are apportioned into 278 [^10] stanzas (v<i>ê</i><i>k</i>êstŏ); and the Nasks also into 278 categories, every single category _having_ borne a form like a single verse [^11], as regards how much and how any_thing_ good is indicated, such as the Patkâr-ra<i>d</i>istân [^12], in which _what is_ legally disputable is reported (pê<i>d</i>âkŏ); the Zâkhmistân [^13], by which the penalty of assault (zâkhm) is reported; the Stôristân [^14], by which the sin and amount of penalty _for_ a wound, as regard beasts _of burden and_ cattle, are reported; the Aratê<i>s</i>târistân [^15], by which battle is reported; the Pasû<i>s</i>\-haûrvastân [^16], by which the customary keeping of sheep in control is reported; the <i>G</i>ûr<i>d</i>âî-zarîtunistân (‘_corn-sowing code_’) [^17], by which agriculture is reported; the Varistân [^18], by which an ordeal _being_ accomplished is reported; and others of a like description. <span id="p404"><sup><small>[ p. 404 ]</small></sup></span> 6\. Then the Gâthas are apportioned into 1061 [^19] metrical lines (gâs), and the Nasks into 1000 Hâs _and_ Fargar<i>d</i>s [^20], _and_, since the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht [^21] is the priestly master (ra<i>d</i>ŏ) of the Nasks, _and_ the remedy [^22] (darmôn) which is a perfect statement about the master of the resurrection, the existence of _its_ fargar<i>d</i>s about the other fargar<i>d</i>s is therefore 1000 remedies fully combined, _being_ the corn and fodder that are shut up (bastakŏ) when, over that thousand, they supply one that is great, which _in_ every way protects _them_ from hail and rain, _from_ the wind which is hot _and_ that which is cold.

7\. Then the Gâthas are apportioned into 6666 words (mârîk) [^23], and _as to_ the Nasks, too, their own 6666 ordinances (dâ<i>d</i>istânŏ) are therein severed. 8. And the 6666 words, which are in the Gâthas, are <span id="p405"><sup><small>[ p. 405 ]</small></sup></span> an indicator of _the period_ from the adversary _having_ come to the creatures, as far as unto the end of the six millenniums [^24]—each millennium _being_ ten centuries—which amount to 60 single centuries—a century _being_ ten tens [^25]—and up to _the time_ when its [^26] cold _and_ distress arrive, which become awful; the 600, including the excess as far as one ten [^27], are years of the 6000 years which are the words of the six Gâthas that are the first indicator of the six millenniums; therefore of the 60 centuries are then the 600 and those which are _added_ to _them_ (zak-î gha<i>l</i>).

9\. And after those 6000, which are the 6000 years, are the Airyaman [^28] of Ashavahi<i>s</i>t _and_ the accompanying sayings (ham-v<i>â</i><i>k</i>ŏ) which are at the end of the Gâthas; those are the 57 years of Sôshâns [^29], and for the sake of them, too, are the Airyaman _and_ from the praise of righteousness at _its_ end _to_ the consecration of the Airyaman, originally 57 words (mârîk), because the praise of righteousness for the Airyaman is 12, and the consecration of the Airyaman is 21, _of_ the original 57 [^30].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (401:1) Who was high-priest of Sîrkân, in the south of Persia, towards the end of the ninth century, being contemporary with the last reviser of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> (see S.B.E., vol. xviii, p. xxvii). This extract from his Selections constitutes the ‘particulars about the Gâthas and the connection of the Ahunavair with the Nasks,’ mentioned in the final footnote to Zs. XI, 10. For the Pahlavi text the translator is dependent upon a single MS., copied from K35 when this latter MS. was complete, and said to be now in the library of Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji in Bombay.

[^2]: (401:2) See Dk. VIII, Chap. I, 7.

[^3]: (401:3) The word gâsânŏ is usually written like dahi<i>s</i>nŏ in the MS.

[^4]: (401:4) The three-lined stanzas of the Gâthas are 100 in the Ahunavaiti (Yas. XXVIII-XXXIV), 40 in the Yasna of seven hâs (Yas. XXXV-XLI), and 22 in the Vohû-khshathra (Yas. LI), altogether 162 three-lined stanzas; the four-lined are one in the U<i>s</i>tavaiti (Yas. XLVI, 15), 41 in the Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû (Yas. XLVII-L), and nine in the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti (Yas. LIII), altogether 51 four-lined stanzas; p. 402 and the five-lined stanzas are the remaining 65 in the U<i>s</i>tavaiti (Yas. XLIII-XLVI); making the total of 278 stanzas mentioned in § 5. Yas. XLII is a later supplement to the Yasna of seven hâs, and, in the MSS. Pt4, Mf4, it is headed as follows:—<i>A</i><i>v</i>ar vaharakŏ-î h<i>a</i>ft hâ<i>d</i>ŏ Yastô y<i>a</i><i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîk bûn, ‘the beginning of worshipping as regards the portions of the Yasna of seven hâs.’

[^5]: (402:1) The MS. corrupts these two names into the one word asnavatŏ by omitting the syllables aû<i>s</i>ta.

[^6]: (402:2) The Stô<i>d</i>\-ya<i>s</i>t, or first of the Gâthic Nasks (see Dk. VIII, Chap. I, 9).

[^7]: (402:3) The third and fourth of the Hadha-mãthric Nasks (ibid. 10).

[^8]: (402:4) The fifth of the Legal Nasks (ibid. 11).

[^9]: (402:5) The three sacred formulas, Yathâ-ahû-vairyô, Ashem-vohû, p. 403 and YêNhê-hâtãm, with the seventeen hâs of the five real Gâthas, and either the Yasna of seven hâs, counted as a single item, or the Airyaman, will make up the twenty-one divisions (compare the names applied to each fargar<i>d</i> of the Sû<i>d</i>kar, Var<i>s</i>tmânsar, and Bakŏ Nasks in Dk. IX).

[^10]: (403:1) See § 2 n; here the MS. has 288, by miswriting, in both occurrences of the ciphers.

[^11]: (403:2) Doubtful; the text appears to be as follows:—ko<i>l</i>â ra<i>g</i>istakŏ-aê bûr<i>d</i>ŏ <i>s</i>an mânâk ak gâh.

[^12]: (403:3) See Dk. VIII, Chap. XVI.

[^13]: (403:4) Equivalent to Zatamistân (ibid. Chap. XVII), see Darmesteter's suggestion (ibid. Chap. XVI, 8 n).

[^14]: (403:5) Ibid. Chap. XXIV; here spelt Stôritân by mistake.

[^15]: (403:6) Ibid. Chap. XXVI.

[^16]: (403:7) Ibid. Chap. XXIII; here written Pa<i>s</i>û<i>s</i>\-haûristân.

[^17]: (403:8) Ibid. Chap. XXXI, 30-32.

[^18]: (403:9) Ibid. Chap. XLII; here written Varîstân.

[^19]: (404:1) See Sls. XIII, 50; that this number is correct may be seen from the details given in § 2 n.

[^20]: (404:2) See Dk. VIII, Chap. I, 20; here the MS. has âyûînŏ instead of hâtŏ, by miswriting.

[^21]: (404:3) The sixth of the Gâthic Nasks (see Dk. VIII, Chap. I, 9).

[^22]: (404:4) See Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 13, where the word used is bêsh<i>â</i><i>z</i>ŏ.

[^23]: (404:5) According to Sls. XIII, 50 the six Gâthas (including the Yasna of seven hâs) contain 5567 vâ<i>k</i>ak, 9999 mârîk, and 36,554 khûr<i>d</i>ak; which enumeration makes the meaning of mârîk doubtful. In our present text, however, it must have its usual meaning of ‘word,’ as the number of 6666 words in the six Gâthas can be obtained by including the customary repetition of the first stanza of each Hâ of the five real Gâthas, with the text of the Airyaman and of the introductions to Yas. XXVIII, XXXV, and probably the homage formula prefixed to each Gâtha; also by considering each component of a compound as a separate word, and all verbal prefixes as separable; and by counting all enclitics except -<i>k</i>â, in accordance with the different modes of treating -<i>k</i>îd and -<i>k</i>â in counting the words of the Ahunavair. If the three sacred formula were included, and the Airyaman and five homage formulas were omitted, the total would be nearly the same.

[^24]: (405:1) The three millenniums during which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Aharman had nearly equal influence, and the last three millenniums during which the power of Aharman diminishes (see Bd. I, 20).

[^25]: (405:2) Assuming that ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg) stands for ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_4/001.jpg).

[^26]: (405:3) Assuming that mûna<i>s</i>, ‘whose,’ stands for amata<i>s</i>.

[^27]: (405:4) As the cipher for ‘one’ precedes that for ‘ten,’ it may possibly mean ‘one _less than_ ten,’ as in the Roman IX. At any rate, 6609 years with the 57 accounted for in § 9 make up the requisite total of 6666; but the mode of making this number correspond with the six millenniums is not very clear.

[^28]: (405:5) Yas. LIV, 1.

[^29]: (405:6) See Dk. VIII, Chap. XIV, 14; Bd. XXX, 7.

[^30]: (405:7) The Airyaman contains 24 words, its Ashem-vohû 12, and its consecration (Yas. LIV, 2) 21 words, making altogether 57 words.
