## Footnotes

[^1]: (121:1) Corresponding to the eighteenth word, yim, in the Ahunavair, according to E. P. Riv.; but it is the nineteenth Nask in other Rivâyats. This name, which is here written like Zakî-hat-min, should probably be Zîk-a<i>î</i>t-tûm, meaning ‘the most intimate concerns,’ as the Nask refers chiefly to personal and family law; but it is called Askâram, or Sakadâm, in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained fifty-two kardah, fargar<i>d</i>s, or vê<i>d</i>ast; thus agreeing with the total of the sections mentioned in Chaps. XXXVIII, XLI.

[^2]: (121:2) It is possible to read yêdatô, ‘sacred being,’ instead of dâ<i>d</i>ŏ, ‘law.’

[^1]: (122:1) To protect it from the demons who are supposed to be specially dangerous during the first three nights.

[^2]: (122:2) Equivalent to ‘mid-spring butter,’ the Av. maidhyô-zaremaya, ‘mid-verdure,’ being the season corresponding to the middle of the second Parsi month, which was early in May when the year commenced at the vernal equinox (see Bd. XXV, 6, 21).

[^1]: (123:1) See Chap. XVII, 6.

[^2]: (123:2) This passage appears to refer to that quoted in Farh. Oîm, p. 38, ll. 8, 9; though the latter part of Chap. XLI, 19 is more applicable to ll. 4-8 of the same page.

[^1]: (124:1) Or <i>g</i>âmak may mean ‘a cup.’

[^2]: (124:2) Reading min gûnagîhâ.

[^1]: (125:1) See Dd. XXXIX, 1 n.

[^1]: (126:1) Intended for ceremonial purification.

[^1]: (127:1) For irrigation.

[^2]: (127:2) Reading virûnag, but the word is miswritten nîrang-î.

[^1]: (128:1) In the shape of sluices for regulating the supply of water for irrigation.

[^1]: (129:1) Instead of khar va-khazûrâ, the MS. has khôr va-zak-î ras.

[^2]: (129:2) Assuming that minênamakŏ-1 stands for apênamakŏ-1; p. 130 the copyist having mistaken <i>a</i>p for <i>a</i><i>z</i>, and substituted the Zvâri<i>s</i> equivalent min for the latter which he supposed was a separate word.

[^1]: (130:1) Or ‘abstracting.’

[^2]: (130:2) See Chaps. XVII, 6, XXXVII, II.

[^3]: (130:3) Two brothers who were contemporaries of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. Frashô<i>s</i>tar was his father-in-law, and <i>G</i>âmâsp was prime minister of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.
