## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK IX. CHAPTER XXXIX.

_Var<i>s</i>tmânsar Nask_.

1\. _In_ the sixteenth fargar<i>d</i>, Kamnamaêza [^1], about departure to any land whatever [^2], in renewed search _of_ fortune, _there is_ also this, namely: ‘Do not stay _away_ discontentedly from this thy ceremonial and obeisance, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! through love of us, when they do not satisfy thee—_neither_ thy own, nor the confederate, nor the companion, nor the serf, nor the wicked tyrant [^3]—by whom those who are demons are _wont_ to be worshipped. 2. And where and when thou art far from us, even then do not stand aloof from our affairs; and also when the affairs of the worldly _existence_ shall not stand well for thee, even then thou shouldst reverence us and shouldst pay us homage.’ 3. So also this, that the wish _of_ the evil spirit is thus: ‘Thou shouldst not reverence and shouldst not pay homage to the archangels; and here [^4] _the people_ shall possess neither lordship, nor priestly instruction—that is, ruler and <span id="p277"><sup><small>[ p. 277 ]</small></sup></span> high-priest—and their desire is not _for_ perfect righteousness.’

4\. And this, too, _is said_, namely: ‘_Of_ the contracted [^5] spirituality and deficient wealth [^6], owing to the little progress of men who are self-gratifiers, thou art aware, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _thou_ who art no seeker _of_ this—that is, this want of opulence of thine—because thou dost not know _it_ [^7]; _but_ I perceive those words of complaint of thine, of which I demand an account from thee [^8].’ 5. And this, _too_, namely: ‘Thou art aware _of_ the gratification of desire [^9] _by_ us who are archangels, and _which_ we give for the gratification that thou bringest forth (zihi<i>h</i>); we also give thee the liberty which a friend gives to him who is a friend [^9].’

6\. About _what_ occurs in _future_ ages [^10]: the experienced (arvandân) who are beneficial through teaching _and_ practising wisdom [^11], and the thirst of youths is increased by them; by the assistance of complete mindfulness they improve the world of righteousness and produce distress for the fiend; and the advantage due to virtue extends to them [^12]. 7. And this, too, that he who is evilly oppressive has died off through his own deeds [^13]. 8. About always opposing villains with as much strength as exists, so that he who is a good ruler [^14], whose high-priest is the bounteous liturgy (Mânsars<i>p</i>end), may become predominant [^15] over Wrath.

9\. About the praise of the renovators _there_ is this, <span id="p278"><sup><small>[ p. 278 ]</small></sup></span> too, namely: ‘Blessings on good understanding _and_ also on Mit<i>r</i>ô, whose punishment of sinners they shall inflict for this consideration, that _he is_ intelligent _and_ friendly (mit<i>r</i>ô-pân) [^16].’ 10. And, about adjudication _as to_ a kinsman (naf<i>s</i>man) of any one whatever, _there_ is this, too, namely: ‘Through a revival of Rashnû, whoever is righteous and also whoever is wicked—that is, every one—is to be kept for judicial investigation [^17].’ 11. This, too, namely: ‘A kinsman is to be considered as virtuous [^18], by whom his own soul is preserved from wickedness [^19].’ 12. _And_ this, too, namely: ‘So thy high-priest is he whose own religion is pure [^20].’

13\. About the characteristics of the fiend, the broken-down (khastakŏ) Mânih [^21],and the destruction of the wicked who _were_ listening to him, that which came from him who _was_ monarch. 14. And this, too, namely: ‘The wicked _one_, who gives my world to that which the malicious [^22] Aharman has established _as_ supremacy (lâlâîh), is he who is a self-wounding [^23] demon that is set going for the death of the world of righteousness which he praises. 15. The ceremonial <span id="p279"><sup><small>[ p. 279 ]</small></sup></span> of righteousness is not such as that he praises, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! the priestly authority of the worldly settlements (gêhânân) that he mentions thus: “In priestly authority and high-priestship I _am_ better (sapîr) _and_ am better suitable;” and not so, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! is that excretion (mûtri<i>s</i>nŏ) [^24] he stirs up for mankind; that _which_ he mentions to them becomes a perpetual effusion from him, and they who stirred up the excretion afterwards think it theirs, _and_ that which is a perfect ceremonial of the demons occurs. 16. Through the opposing arrival _of_ Srôsh [^25], the righteous, the ruler is in vexation with that person; that ruler who is a protection of these _others_ through good emanation [^26]—not through evil living—and at every time a distresser _of_ the wicked [^27].’

17\. About the peculiarity of attracters _to_ the religion, _and_ the good works of those attracted [^28]. 18. About the signs of the last times, which _are_ the millenniums of the sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

19\. This, too, that they cause disturbance (aâramênd) unto the sovereignty, and _they_ who are Kaîs and Karaps [^29], those even who are the most evil-ruling in the country—who by villanous deeds are those _who_ destroy the existence of mankind through statements, and destroy their own souls [^30]—_also_ destroy the material world which, confused by them, <span id="p280"><sup><small>[ p. 280 ]</small></sup></span> is more beloved than righteousness; even the sovereignty is a scanty shelter, among the existences, from those whose command is villanous, when they produce _that_ which is vicious and deliver their pupils (âmûkhtagânŏ) to that which is _their_ end (<i>a</i>fdûm), to the fiendish abode [^31].

20\. And here, too, about the praise of the family of the Fryânaks [^32] it speaks thus: ‘Righteousness comes up, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân! from the descendants and posterity of Tûrân; when extracted by the Fryânaks _it_ is stated [^33] just as _though_ it were by Tûrân; through the assistance of complete mindfulness they develope the world [^34] of righteousness and produce distress for the fiend; they likewise think about _it_ with Good Thought, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _and_ thou shouldst bring forth (zâyê<i>s</i>) their gratification [^35] from us, who are archangels, by words, that is, do thou demand _it_.’

21\. This, too, _is said_, namely: ‘This liberality which is _for_ thee is _for us_ who are archangels; by him who shall provide liberality for thee [^36], it is provided for us.’ 22. About the praise of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp _there_ is this, too, namely: ‘Kai-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^37] _has_ propitiated thee, among the existences, by liberal giving; that Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, whose coming forth to thee in distress is through the reign of Vohûman, has developed the material world of righteousness; thou <span id="p281"><sup><small>[ p. 281 ]</small></sup></span> shouldst think of him, the good companion, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! the pure friend who is Kat-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^38]; such is that Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, the active, who, when he praises the religion, is attracting fellow-dwellers _and_ converts _them_, that is, he brings them on to the religion [^39].’

23\. About attracting the Spîtâmas to the religion _there_ is this, too, namely: ‘Thou shouldst speak thus to the Spîtâmas: "Praise righteousness with much homage about _it_ mentally; and a concession is to be discriminated by you, as well as whatever is no concession; even for those deeds _of_ yours righteousness is the reward given unto you, that reward which is much given by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^40]."’ 24. About the place of the four marvels produced by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _in_ yonder _world_: there where is the reign of Vohûman [^41], there where is the hospitality of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^42], there where religion is _along_ with complete mindfulness [^43], _and_ there where are the souls of the liberal [^44].

25\. About advice to Zaratû<i>s</i>t as to speech, made for mankind, which is proportionate—abandoning want of proportion—which is an appropriation of liberality with humility and a wise proportion [^45] for good works. 26. This, too, namely: ‘To him who gives himself mentally up to thee in discipleship, thou also shouldst give up the best which _thou hast_ to give of thine own; and thou shouldst give wealth to him who shall give wealth to thee [^46], because so thy soul would be perfect, <i>O</i> righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t! when it shall act thus.’ 27. This, too: ‘Thou <span id="p282"><sup><small>[ p. 282 ]</small></sup></span> shouldst select this religion of mine with wisdom _and_ also with thought [^47].’ 28. This, too, that _as to_ him who _has_ to act with the freedom from effort (<i>a</i>pêsitûnagîh) of righteousness [^48] _and_ owing to _it_, for the good works done by him the gift is good. 29. This, too, that whoever seeks by good works, _and_ seeks good works by innocence, obtains freedom from harm (<i>a</i>\-nâsîh); _and_ whoever is liberal to the sacred beings [^49] is free from destruction (<i>a</i>\-nasîni<i>s</i>nŏ), owing to the liberality of the sacred beings. 30. _And_ this, too, namely: ‘These _are_ the rewards I am aware of [^50], which have been, which still are, and which ever _will_ be.’

31\. Perfect excellence is righteousness.

[^21]: (278:6) The arch-heretic who was born in A.D. 215-6, first preached his doctrines on the coronation day of king Shahpûr I (20th March, 242), and was put to death by order of Bahrâm I in A.D. 276-7 (see Nŏldeke's Gesch. der Sas. pp. 47, 412, 415). From the mode in which he and his followers are mentioned in §§ 13-16, it would seem that the original Pahlavi version of this Nask must have been made at a time when this heresy was still fresh in men's memories, as it would have been in the first half of the fourth century, when Âtû<i>r</i>pâ<i>d</i>\-î Mâ<i>r</i>aspendân was collecting and revising the sacred books.
