## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1]. CHAPTER XV.

1\. About the brothers who _were_ a band of opponents of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 2. The Karaps and Aûsikhshes [^3] _were_ brothers’ sons, and have become the devastation (gâstâragîh) of the Irânians; the devastators of the Irânians (Êrânân) _were_ from Kôkharê<i>d</i> [^4], and Kôkharê<i>d</i> _was_ born from Aêshm and Mânû<i>s</i>ak, the sister of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^5]. 3. At the place where Zaratû<i>s</i>t _was_ born, five brothers have been, whose names were Brâ<i>d</i>\-rûkhsh, Brâ<i>d</i>\-rôyi<i>s</i>n, Brâ<i>d</i>\-rêsh the Tûr, Hazân, and Vadast [^6]. 4. Their <span id="p144"><sup><small>[ p. 144 ]</small></sup></span> brotherhood of five—of which the middle _one was_ Brâ<i>d</i>\-rêsh the Tûr, who became more of an adversary of Zaratû<i>s</i>t—_was_ a semblance of the brother-hood of five who _were_ sons of Pôrûshaspô, of whom the middle _one_ was Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

5\. Of the four brothers _of_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the names of the two before Zaratû<i>s</i>t _were_ Ratû<i>s</i>tar and Rangû<i>s</i>tar, and of the two after _him_ No<i>d</i>arîgâ and Nîvê<i>d</i>i<i>s</i> [^1]. 6. The middle position of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is for the reason that he is so produced at that time, as an inter-medium of the early narrators and the later narrators, that three millenniums came before him and three after. 7. So that he _has_ prescribed to the creatures in what manner he would teach the ancients as to what _had_ occurred, and _in_ what manner _it_ is also to be done as regards what _will_ occur; as is stated in the Gâthas [^2] thus: ‘Both those I ask of thee, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! even whatever _has_ happened till now, _and_ whatever shall happen henceforth?’

## Footnotes

[^3]: (143:3) Av. ‘Karapâ Usikhsh-<i>k</i>â’ of Yas. XLIV, 20 c; the Kavâ, a third class of pre-Zoroastrian priests, is also mentioned ibid. 20 d. Compare Dk. VII, ii, 9 n.

[^4]: (143:4) Av. Ka<i>h</i><i>v</i>aredha, Yas. LX, 6, 7 (Sp.) where it is translated by kâstâr, ‘diminisher, devastator,’ of whom it is here said to be the father; see also Yt. III, 9, 12, 16.

[^5]: (143:5) Compare the legend of the descent of the ape and bear from a demon and Yimak, sister of Yim, in Bd. XXIII, 1.

[^6]: (143:6) As these names do not occur in the Avesta, their pronunciation p. 144 has to be guessed so as to give a probable meaning to the Pahlavi spelling. The writing of the last name is complicated; it is written ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_5/001.jpg) and ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_5/001.jpg) in the two MS. authorities, which forms can be most obviously read Vasam and Saman, but Saman can also be read as the Zvâri<i>s</i> yad<i>â</i> = dast, ‘a hand;’ this leads to the conclusion that the original name underlies the form Vadast, and this is confirmed by the name of the Karap Vaêdvôi<i>s</i>t written at full length in Dk. VII, iv, 21-24. See ibid. ii, 9 n.

[^1]: (144:1) These brothers seem unmentioned elsewhere, and the existence of the elder two would imply another mother. The pronunciation of the names is guessed.

[^2]: (144:2) Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 14 a.
