## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER XI.

1\. About the marvellousness which is after the end of the millennium of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh and the arrival of the Triumphant Benefiter, until the end of the fifty-seventh year of Sôshâns and the production of the renovation among the existences.

2\. Concerning the marvellousness of Sôshâns as to splendour _and_ glory of person, it says that ‘when the coming of the last rotation of those rotations of the seasons of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh _occurs_, the man Sôshâns is born [^1] whose food is spiritual _and_ body sunny (that is, his body is as radiant as the sun);’ also this, that ‘he looks on all sides with six-eyed power (6-dôîsarîh), _and_ sees the remedy for persecution by the fiend.’

3\. This, too, that with him is the triumphant Kayân glory ‘which the mighty Frê<i>d</i>ûn [^2] bore when Az-4 Dahâk [^3] _was_ smitten by him; also Kai-Khûsrôî [^4] was bearing it when the Tûr Frangrâsîyâk [^5] _was_ smitten by him; also Frangrâsîyâk bore it when the Drvê Zênîgâk [^6] _was_ smitten by him; _and_ <span id="p117"><sup><small>[ p. 117 ]</small></sup></span> Kai-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^1] shall bear it when you fully attract him to righteousness, _and_ through it he shall carry off the fiend _from_ the concerns of the world of righteousness [^2].’

4\. And this, too, that in fifty-seven _of_ his years _there_ occur the annihilation of the fiendishness of the two-legged race _and_ others, and the subjugation of disease and decrepitude, _of_ death and persecution, and _of_ the original evil _of_ tyranny, apostasy, and depravity; _there_ arise a perpetual verdant growth of vegetation _and_ the primitive gift of joyfulness; _and there_ are seventeen years _of_ vegetable-eating, thirty years _of_ water-drinking, _and_ ten years of spiritual food.

5\. And all the splendour, glory, and power, which _have_ arisen in all those possessing splendour, glory, _and_ power, _are_ in him on whom they arrive together and for those who are his, when many inferior human beings are aroused splendid _and_ powerful; and through their power and glory all the troops of the fiend are smitten. 6. And all mankind remain of one accord in the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, owing to the will of the creator, the command _of_ that _apostle_, and the resources of his companions.

7\. At the end of the fifty-seven years the fiend _and_ Aharman are annihilated, the renovation _for_ the future existence occurs, _and_ the whole of the good creation is provided with purity, _and_ perfect <span id="p118"><sup><small>[ p. 118 ]</small></sup></span> splendour. 8. _Just_ as revelation states thus: ‘When that millennium has fully elapsed, which is the third of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, that Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper whose name is so Triumphant [^1] then marches forward from the water Kanyisâ [^2] with a thousand companions and also maidens _of_ restrained disposition and blindly-striving behaviour [^3]; and he smites the wicked people who _are_ tyrannical, and annihilates them.’

9\. Then those Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers smite, and none are smiting them. 0. Then those Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers produce a longing for a renovation among the existences, _one_ ever-living, ever-beneficial, and ever desiring a Lord. 11. ‘Then I, who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, produce the renovation according to the longing among the existences, _one_ ever-living, ever-beneficial, _and ever_ desiring a Lord.’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (116:1) The date here indicated seems to be about twenty-eight years later than that intended in Chap. X, 15-19.

[^2]: (116:2) See Chap. I, 25.

[^3]: (116:3) See Chap. I, 26.

[^4]: (116:4) See Chap. I, 39.

[^5]: (116:5) See Chap. I, 31, 39.

[^6]: (116:6) Av. Drv<i>a</i>u Zainigâu<i>s</i>, an Arab chieftain who invaded Irân p. 117 in early times and killed many with his evil eye, till the Irânians invited Frangrâsîyâk to destroy him (see Darmesteter's French translation of part of Chap. XLI of Irânian Bundahi<i>s</i> in Annales du Musée Guimet, vol. xxii, p. 401).

[^1]: (117:1) See Chap. I, 41.

[^2]: (117:2) From a Pahlavi version of Yt. XIX, 92, 93, with the second and third clauses transposed.

[^1]: (118:1) See Chap. X, 17.

[^2]: (118:2) Reading the name as Pâzand; if it were Pahlavi it would have to be read Kânmâsâî, because Irânian Pâz. yi is very like Pahl. mâ. It is Kyânsih in Bd. XIII, 16; XX, 34; XXI, 6, 7, and represents Av. Kãsava, the brackish lake or sea of Sagastân.

[^3]: (118:3) Reading ‘va-bigar-<i>î</i><i>k</i>\-i vand khîm va-kûr-<i>k</i>akhŏ râs,’ and assuming that bigar is Ar. bikr, as an Arabic word is occasionally used in the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> (see Chap. II, 2 n) though very rarely. Bd. XXX, 17, mentions ‘fifteen men and fifteen damsels’ as assisting Sôshâns at the time of the renovation of the universe.
