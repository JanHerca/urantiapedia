## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER XXII.

1\. About the seven questionings (7-fra<i>s</i>nŏîh), with reference to religion, of the seven archangels, _which_ occurred in seven places [^1].

2\. For the occurrence of the first questioning [^2], that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the person of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, who _was_ <span id="p160"><sup><small>[ p. 160 ]</small></sup></span> the upholder of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, came out to a conference on the bank of the water of Dâîtîh [^3].

3\. For the occurrence of the second, _which_ is Vohûmanô's, five animals out of the five species [^4] which are the worldly tokens of Vohûmanô, have come with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference on Hûgar and Aûsind [^5]; and on that day also, before their coming out to the conference, _their_ tongues are fully liberated _and_ spoke with human words. 4. And among the rest [^6] is a fish of one species, Arzuvâ [^7] _by_ name; of those in burrows (khanŏîgânŏ) _are_ the white ermine _and_ white marten; of the flying creatures (vâyandagân) is the Kar<i>s</i>ipt [^8], a bird like a species of water-fowl; of the wide-travellers (farâkhvŏ-raftârânŏ) is the hare which is showing wild beasts the way to the water; and of those suitable for grazing (<i>k</i>arakŏ-ar<i>g</i>ânîgân) is the white ass-goat; with human words they also accepted the religion from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 5. With the chieftainship of the five species they are intrusted, so that the like animals also, with their own voices, _and_ as much as their knowledge is capable, shall recount the powerfulness _of_ the religion. <span id="p161"><sup><small>[ p. 161 ]</small></sup></span> 6. And freedom from assault, exemption from persecution, and proper maintenance of the five species of animals, _were_ prescribed by him [^9] to Zaratû<i>s</i>t with seemingly very awful admonition.

7\. For the occurrence of the third questioning, which is A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô's, the spirits of the fires have come out with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference at the Tô<i>g</i>ân water [^10]; and, in that questioning, care for the proper maintenance of the Varahrân fire [^11], and the propitiation of all fires, is explained to him.

8\. For the occurrence of the fourth questioning, which is Shatvê<i>r</i>'s, the spirits of the metals have come with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference at Sarâî [^12], a settlement on the Mîvân [^12]; _and he was_ fully admonished about various proper preservations of the metals, _and as to_ not producing warlike accoutrements of gold.

9\. For the occurrence of the fifth questioning, which is Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>'s, the spirits of the regions, frontiers, stations (aûstâmân), settlements (rû<i>d</i>astâkân), and districts, as many as were desirable, have come out with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference _where_ there is a spring (khânîgô-aê) which comes out from the Asnavad mountain [^13], _and_ goes into the Dâîtîh, like those of Satavês who is blowing the Pâîrîgs [^14]. 10. And _Zaratû<i>s</i>t was_ also thus admonished <span id="p162"><sup><small>[ p. 162 ]</small></sup></span> by her, about the care and propitiation of the earth: that each district is _to be_ intrusted _to_ a faithful testifier (gôkâs-î v<i>â</i><i>v</i>ar), each settlement _to_ a judge acquainted with the law, _each_ station _to_ an officiating priest (magôpatŏ) of just intentions, _and_ each frontier _to_ a pure priestly authority (ra<i>d</i>ŏ); over all is proclaimed the councillor of the spirits, the supreme priest (magôpatânŏ magôpatŏ), and through him the sovereignty of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is provided.

11\. For the occurrence of the sixth questioning, which is Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i>'s, the spirits of seas _and_ rivers have come with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference at the Asnavad mountain [^15], and he _was_ told about the care and propitiation of water.

12\. For the occurrence of the seventh questioning, which is Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i>'s, the spirits of plants have come out with Zaratû<i>s</i>t to a conference on the precipitous bank of the Dare<i>g</i>a [^16], on the bank (bâr) of the water of Dâîtîh, and different places; and he _was_ informed about the care _and_ propitiation of plants.

13\. The seven questionings are explained within the length of these winters, which are _of_ five months, _and_ within ten years [^17].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (159:2) Compare Dk. VIII, xiv, 5, 6, 9.

[^2]: (159:3) This has been narrated in the preceding chapter.

[^3]: (160:1) See Dk. VII, iii, 51, 54.

[^4]: (160:2) These species, which are named in § 4, are those mentioned in the Avesta, Visp. I, I.

[^5]: (160:3) Av. Hukairya of Yt. XII, 24, and Us-hindu of Yt. VIII, 32, described in Bd. XII, 5, 6, as two neighbouring mountains, for the pure water of Arêdvisûr falls from the summit of Hûgar to Aûsind which stands in the circumambient ocean.

[^6]: (160:4) The remainder of K 35, the MS. brought by Westergaard from Kirmân, is lost; but an old copy of it (BK, see the Introduction) exists in Bombay, which supplies the missing text, as an authority independent of T.

[^7]: (160:5) See Bd. XIV, 26; apparently the same as the Ari<i>z</i>, or Kar, the chief of fish, ibid. XVIII, 3, 5; XXIV, 13.

[^8]: (160:6) See Bd. XIV, 23; XIX, 16; XXIV, 11.

[^9]: (161:1) By Vohûmanô, as the protector of useful animals.

[^10]: (161:2) Possibly the Te<i>g</i>end river, the Zend or Zôndak of Bd. XX, 7, 15.

[^11]: (161:3) The Bahrâm, or sacred fire at places of worship.

[^12]: (161:4) Names not clearly identified, and readings uncertain.

[^13]: (161:5) In Âtû<i>r</i>\-pâtakân, and the Gû<i>s</i>nasp, fire was established upon it (see Bd. XII, 2, 26; XVII, 7).

[^14]: (161:6) Pahl. ‘Satavês-t Pâîrîg damânŏ ânŏ <i>k</i>îgûn.’ Referring probably to Yt. VIII, 8, 9. Satavês is the southern chieftain of the stars, as correctly stated in the Iranian Bûndahi<i>s</i> (compare Bd. II, 7; XIII, 12); and the Pâîrîgs are meteors.

[^15]: (162:1) See § 9.

[^16]: (162:2) Pahl. ‘pavan Dare<i>g</i>în zbâr’ = Av. ‘Dre<i>g</i>ya paiti zbarahi’ of Vd. XIX, 4; a mythical river in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i>, where Pôrûshaspô resided (Bd. XX, 32).

[^17]: (162:3) The Pahlavi is rather vague, but it is clear that Zaratû<i>s</i>t starts for his conference at thirty years of age (Chap. XXI, 1), returns from it ten years later (Chap. XXIII, I), and the conversion of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp occupies two years longer (Chap. XXIII, 5), occurring when Zaratû<i>s</i>t was forty-two years old and thirty-five years before his passing away at the age of seventy-seven (Chap. XXIII, 9).

At this point another dislocation of text occurs in all existing p. 163 MSS., owing to the accidental interpolation of three loose folios of another text, between this chapter and the next, in some unknown copy written before 1530. In the MSS. the text is written continuously, without division into chapters. But the connection of this chapter with the next one, which is here restored to its proper position, is clearly shown by the reference to the ‘ten years’ of conference, with which this chapter ends, and the next one begins. The accidentally interpolated text is here classified as Chaps. XXIV and XXV, but its real connections have not yet been traced.
