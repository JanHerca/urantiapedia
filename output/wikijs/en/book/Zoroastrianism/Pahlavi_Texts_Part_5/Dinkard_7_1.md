## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER I.

1\. _For_ the gratification _of_ the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, even through the complete superiority of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, adorned by omniscience, in the world.

2\. The seventh _book_ is about the marvellousness of the greatest reminder of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^1] of the Spîtâmas; also of the mindfulness of that illustrious _one_ by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and _of_ his religion, arisen through the word of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, being blessed among those of the region of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp; from the Exposition of the Good Religion [^2].

3\. But, before that, _there_ is purposely written whatever _was_ the progress of the character and effect of the good religion and its first acceptor in the spiritual and worldly _existences_; and, after that, <span id="p4"><sup><small>[ p. 4 ]</small></sup></span> the prophets, apostles, _and_ upholders in the period as far as Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _whose_ guardian spirit is reverenced, and their religion, which is this, due to the utterance and splendour with which they have been blessed with prophecy among mankind [^3].

4\. According to the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion and the Exposition of the Good Religion, it is the nature of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s disposition and his knowledge as to the complete obtainment of the first creature, the archangel Vohûmanô, and the first progress spiritually among the archangels _and_ the other sacred beings of the spiritual _and worldly existences_, and materially in Gâyômar<i>d</i>, the first man, through concurrent and complete acceptance from the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the needful atonement in his own period through meditation, and the smiting thereby of the fiend of that period and the opposition thereof, by thinking of the creator's teaching, _that constitute_ the whole _of_ that first utterance [^4] of the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

5\. According to the declaration of the good religion about the production of existence, which is the praise of him who _was_ the causer of existence and creator, the beneficent spirit, the first craving among mankind _was_ this, that ‘we be happy and _be_ the creation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>;’ and the last, as regards the preservation of a remedy for mankind, is _this, that_ ‘the best is this, that the formation of lives _be_ perfect now, though rendered sickly by him; and the spiritual existences of mankind _be so_ now, though the destroyer _has_ come to the creatures.’ 6. _For_  <span id="p5"><sup><small>[ p. 5 ]</small></sup></span> human beings of the lineage of Gâyômar<i>d</i> this is the one thing good, when they shall perform their duty and good works; and one's work is to smite one's own opposing fiend; an instance presentable to _any_ of the lineage, that it is important _for_ every one of you to smite his own opposing fiend, is the freedom from molestation which occurs thereby, and the non-contamination of the creatures by the destroyer; and it is that effect which the creator _of_ creation _has_ produced for it.

7\. And this, too, is declared by the good religion, that through a true-spoken statement Gâyômar<i>d</i> attained to the good spiritual lordship [^5] of the archangels (that is, _he was_ fit for the supreme heaven [^6]). 8. And after Gâyômar<i>d</i>, at various periods until the ever-favouring [^7] Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas, _whose_ guardian spirit is reverenced; much also _was_ his acquaintance with knowledge, and _his_ work _was_ the preservation of the mankind of that time in which he came into notice; moreover he became requisite for conference with the creator; and because of _their_ superior carrying on of destiny [^8], by command of the <span id="p6"><sup><small>[ p. 6 ]</small></sup></span> creator, _it is_ declared in the good religion, _that_ the combined titles of prophet (vakhshvar), acceptor, _and_ promoter _are_ enumerated of them.

9\. As Gâyômar<i>d</i> passed away, _it_ [^9] _came_ to Masyê and Masyâôî [^10], the second of worldly beings who _were_ the progeny of Gâyômar<i>d</i>, the first; _and it_ is declared, by the word of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, that he spoke to them, when they had been produced by him, thus: ‘You are the men I produce, you are the parents of the parents of all embodied existence; and so do you men not worship the demons, for the possession of complete mindfulness is the best _thing_ produced by me for you, so that you _may_ fully observe duty and ordinances with complete mindfulness.’ 10. And the bountifulness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _was_ extolled by them, and they went on with their own duty; they also performed the will of the creator, enjoyed the advantage of the many duties of the world, _and_ practised next-of-kin marriage for procreation, union, and the complete progress of the creations in the world, which are the best good works of mankind. 11. The creator showed them the sowing of corn, as declared in the words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘This is thine, O Masyê! which is an ox; thine, too, is this corn; and thine those other appliances; henceforth thou shouldst know _them_ well.’ <span id="p7"><sup><small>[ p. 7 ]</small></sup></span> 12\. This, too, is declared by the good religion, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to Hadish [^11], one of the sacred beings thoroughly worthy through righteousness, thus: ‘<i>O</i> Hadish, who _art_ thoroughly worthy through righteousness! thou shouldst proceed to Masyê and Masyâôî, thou shouldst procure thy [^12] corn _and_ bread from Masyê, and Masyâôî, _and_ shouldst bless theirs thus: "This corn comes up owing to you, _and_, as it came unto you from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels, may the corn extend from you unto your descendants without disturbance from the demons;" _and_ two Ahunavairs [^13] are to be recited for the staying away _of_ the demon and fiend.’ 13. And Hadish, the thoroughly worthy through righteousness, went to Masyê and Masyâôî, and he procured his corn and bread from Masyê and Masyâôî, and _it was_ given by them; he also blessed them thus: ‘May this corn come up from you, as from the archangels! as it came unto you _from_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _and_ the archangels, may it extend from you unto your descendants, without disturbance from the demons;’ and two Ahunavairs _were_ recited by him, for the staying away of the demon _and_ fiend.

14\. And, owing to the explanation of the sacred beings, Masyê and Masyâôî attained also to the manufacture of clothing, the tending of sheep, house-building, and primitive carpentry, the agriculture _and_ husbandry of the ancients, and the memory of their original state; and _these_ proceeded from them through _their_ lineage, presenting an example and <span id="p8"><sup><small>[ p. 8 ]</small></sup></span> spreading _in_ the world, to artificers among the plenitude of artificers.

15\. And after that, the destiny to be carried on came to Sâmak [^14], who _was_ their son, and the descent of _their_ collateral descendants _was_ on to each region and each quarter of the world, _to_ that extent which the creator chose for that region and quarter; _and_ thereby _there_ was a completion of the progress and spreading of mankind into the various regions _and_ quarters.

16\. At another time it came to Vâêgere<i>d</i> and Hôshâng [^15] of the early law (pê<i>s</i>\-dâ<i>d</i>), for providing in the world the law of husbandry, _or_ cultivation of the world, and _of_ sovereignty _or_ protection of the world. 17. And through their companionship and united force, given by religion, the sovereignty and cultivation _of_ the world _were_ prepared through progress and a succession of provisions _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s creatures, _as well_ as the religion appointed by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 18. And through that glory _of destiny_ (gad<i>â</i>) two-thirds of the demons of Mâzanô [^16] _and_ the seven evil-instructed _ones_ [^17] of Aêshm _were_ destroyed by Hôshâng.

19\. After that it came to Tâkhmôrup [^18] the well-armed, and through that glory the demon and evil mankind, the wizard and witch, _were_ smitten by him; idolatry _was_ also cast out by him, and he propagated in _his_ time the reverence _and_ service of the creator; the evil spirit, converted into the shape of a horse, _was_ also carrying him _for_ thirty winters. <span id="p9"><sup><small>[ p. 9 ]</small></sup></span> 20\. And it came, at another time, for the conference with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, to Yim [^19] the splendid, the son of Vîvang,ha; and owing to his accepting the four classes of the religion, _which_ are priesthood, warriorship, husbandry, and artisanship, _there_ are the four classes which are priesthood, warriorship, husbandry, and artisanship, and thereby the world was improved, extended, and developed; he also rendered even the creatures, in a measure, immortal, undecaying, hungerless, thirstless, plentiful, and fully-settled. 21. And in the good religion [^20] _it_ is declared, by the word of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Yim, thus: ‘Then do thou widen my world! (that is, make up _its_ measure more), then do thou extend my world! (that is, make _it_ up larger), and then thou shouldst accept from me the protection, nourishment, and chieftainship of the world; and do thou effect such watchfulness over _it, that_ no one shall be able to occasion the wounding or injury of another.’ 22. And _this was_ accepted and done by Yim, as Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> commanded him; and through the same glory he widened the earth three-thirds larger than that _which_ it was theretofore. 23. And, in that realm of his, the cattle and men of the realm _were_ made immortal by him, and the other creations, water, vegetation, and the various foods, imperishable. 24. And this, too, is declared by the good religion, that the world _was_ made by him like the supreme heaven in pleasantness; also the enclosure made by Yim, constructed by him according to all the commands of the creator [^21], about guarding the creatures from perishing through the winter of <span id="p10"><sup><small>[ p. 10 ]</small></sup></span> Mahrkûs, and likewise many other wonders are reported by the good religion.

25\. And it came, at another time, by command of the creator, to Frê<i>d</i>ûn the Âspîgân [^22] when he was in the pregnant womb, owing to the share of husbandry _in_ the avocations of the religion, through allotment from the glory of Yim, and through its triumphant splendour. 26. And Frê<i>d</i>ûn, through that triumphant splendour, became a responder _to_ Dahâk [^23] from the pregnant womb, and that degraded fiend _was_ averted and paralysed by him; _having_ come to nine years _of age_, he proceeded about his destruction, and through that victory Dahâk _was_ smitten by him [^24], the creatures _were_ saved and relieved thereby, those of Mâzandar and Mâ<i>d</i>a _were_ smitten, their ravage and mischief _were_ removed from the region of Khvanîras, _and_ the region of Khvanîras _was_ preserved _for his_ three sons. 27. And owing to his husbandry, which is the third avocation of the religion, pestilence and disease _were_ disturbed _by_ the medical treatment even of pestilence itself, and he exhibited to mankind also many other wonders produced and useful occupation for the world.

28\. And, in the life-_time_ of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, the same destiny came to Aîrî<i>k</i> [^25], son of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, owing to introduction _by_ the creator, and _was_ diffused in him, and he practised humility; the life. [^26] which is perfect is brought through a prayer from _his_ father Frê<i>d</i>ûn, <span id="p11"><sup><small>[ p. 11 ]</small></sup></span> and that life [^27] came to him from the creator through the blessing of Frê<i>d</i>ûn.

29\. And it came, through _his_ mother, to a descendant of Frê<i>d</i>ûn _and_ descendant of Aîrî<i>k</i>; it proceeded with the angel Nêryôsang to Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^28], and its entire progress was in the lineage of Aîrî<i>k</i>. 30. And it came to Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, the monarch of Irân, and through it many wonder-wrought actions _were_ performed by him; he smote Salm and Tû<i>g</i> in revenge for Aîrî<i>k</i> [^29], he was a responder _to_ the superfluities of foreign countries, he arranged the realm of Irân, improved and fertilised the land of Irân, and made the country of Irân victorious over foreigners.

31\. At another time it came to Aûzôbô, son of Tûmâsp [^30], a descendant of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar the monarch of Irân; _and_, through that destiny and glory combined, the new-born came to mature activity and the proportions of a man during childhood, through agriculture; he disclosed _his_ lamenting mother to the countries of Irân, he marched on to the destruction of foreigners, to drive out _and_ make _them_ outcast from the land of Irân; he also defeated the village-terrifier of the country of Irân, the wizard who frightened his father _and_ fellow-immortals, Frangrâsîyâk of Tûr [^31]; and he developed _and_ fertilised <span id="p12"><sup><small>[ p. 12 ]</small></sup></span> the country of Irân, and increased the many streams _and_ cultivated lands in the country of Irân.

32\. At another time it came to Kerêsâspô the Sâmân [^32], owing to the share of warriorship which is the second avocation of the religion, through allotment from the glory of Yim [^33]; and, through it, the serpent Srôbŏvar which _was_ swallowing horses _and_ swallowing men, the golden-heeled demon Gandarepô, and much other production _of_ adversity _by_ the demon and the fiend—the murderess of the creatures—_were_ destroyed by him.

33\. At another time it came to Kai-Kobâ<i>d</i> [^34], the progenitor of the Kayâns; through it he arranged the realm of Irân, he united the sovereignty with himself in the Kayân race, _and_ he thereby occasioned much splendour _and_ actions of advantage _to_ the creatures.

34\. And it came to Pâtakhsrôbô [^35] _son_ of Aîryêfshvâ [^36], _son_ of T<i>â</i><i>z</i>, who _was_ king of the Arabs, through the mindfulness of the archangel Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô, and his enquiry about it from its own tribe [^37]—_for_ the demon of greediness (<i>â</i><i>z</i>ŏ), with _one_ similarly <span id="p13"><sup><small>[ p. 13 ]</small></sup></span> destined, had rushed for the destruction of him who _was_ very gentle to that tribe [^38]—_as he had_ a full inclination for the ascendancy of the portion whose guidance to the lofty priestly master _was_ owing to the archangel Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô, just as the fish image [^39] of that _other_ portion _was_ for falling into the river; and _it is_ declared _that_ he came to the ceremonial of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

35\. At another time it came to Kaî-Arsh _and his_ brothers [^40], the descendants of Kobâ<i>d</i>; through it they have been all-experienced and powerful, heedful and performing wonders; and the eldest brother of them, Kaî-Ûs, seized upon the sovereignty of the seven regions, _and_ became very illustrious _and_ full of glory. 36. _At_ the same time it came to Aôshnar [^41] who became fully sagacious (pûr-zîr), owing to the glory of Yim, when he was in _his_ mother's womb, and many wonders _were_ taught by him to _his_ mother, through speaking from the mother's womb; also at his birth he vanquished the maleficent spirit by uttering answers _to_ the questions _of_ the deadly Fr<i>â</i><i>k</i>îh the demon-worshipper. 37. He also attained to the chancellorship (farmâ<i>d</i>ârîh) of Kaî-Ûs, and became administrator (râyînî<i>d</i>âr) in his realm _of_ the seven regions; the frontier speech (vîmand-gôbisnîh) _was_ also explained _and_ taught by him, <span id="p14"><sup><small>[ p. 14 ]</small></sup></span> and much other learning of advantage _to_ mankind _who_ are unaffected by the utterance of replies of a foreigner; he _also_ advised the Irânian country with the best-instructed counsel.

38\. And _its_ coming to Kai-Sîyâvakhsh [^42] the illustrious, through the wondrous-formed Kangd<i>e</i><i>z</i> _being_ held by him for the retention _of_ protection _for_ the much splendour _and_ suitable glory of the religion, from which the restoration of time, the re-arrangement of the realm of Irân, _and_ the reunion of power _and_ triumph with the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> are manifest.

39\. It came to Kaî-Khûsrôî [^43], son of Sîyâvakhsh, _and_ through it he smote and vanquished Frangrâsîyâk [^44] _of_ Tûr, the wizard, and his fellow-miscreation Kêrsêvazd [^45] of those of Vakgir [^46], and many other very evil devastators of the world; he also joined in the destruction of that idol-temple which _was_ on the shore of Lake <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast [^47], _and_ demolished that fiendishness which _was_ awful. 40. On account of the desirableness of means for the renovation _of the universe, he is also_ on a throne (nam<i>î</i><i>k</i>ŏ), which is assuredly selected by that destiny, at a secret place where _there_ is an immortal preserver for his body until the renovation, through the will of the creator.

41\. And it came from him, after Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas came to the conference of the creator <span id="p15"><sup><small>[ p. 15 ]</small></sup></span> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and accepted from the omniscient creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> unmixed freedom from pollution, the comprehensive and also recited acquaintance with the knowledge _and_ work of priesthood, warriorship, husbandry, and artisanship, _and_ the separate portions of the Mazda-worshipping revelation (dênô) brought to king Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp by command of the creator, illuminated by the great splendour in that supreme sovereign of the sacred beings; _and_ propagated _by_ the learned of the region, in thee regions which _are_ seven, through the good eloquence which is owing to the succession of creatures until the renovation _of the universe_. 42. And through its production by those who _will be his_ sons, Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, and Sôshâns [^48], the renovation in the existence of the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is immortal; and a more remindful statement of its splendour, glory, _and_ marvellousness is a statement _that_ is written and found below [^49].

43\. And _there_ have also been others before Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the prophet (vakhshvar) of desired fame in the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion; for it is declared that, at times, some came from the spiritual _beings_ to him who _was_ more of a leader, _and_ mankind have become as captivated by the solicitation _and_ interrogation of that affair, as now by the solicitation _and_ interrogation of the religion; the necessity for that period is not now necessary, because all mankind <span id="p16"><sup><small>[ p. 16 ]</small></sup></span> are made acquainted with the religion, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas, _whose_ guardian spirit is righteous, is to be reverenced.

44\. Now, that which is declared in the world is written, about the splendour, glory, and marvellousness of the prophet of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, the best of creations, _whose_ guardian spirit is reverenced, Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas; and ten chapters are published here, as to the information from the Avesta, and _in_ benediction _of_ the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^50].

45\. That of it which is before the birth of that glorious _one_ from _his_ mother _in_ the present _world_.

46\. That of it which is from the birth of that illustrious _one_ onwards, _till_ his coming to a conference _with_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

47\. That of it which is from the conference onwards, till his pre-eminence over prophecy in the world, _and_ the acceptance _of_ the religion _by_ the exalted Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.

48\. That of it which is onwards from that, till the departure (vîkh<i>ê</i><i>z</i>ŏ) of that pure soul to the existence which is best.

49\. That of it which is also successively after that, in the reign of the obedient king Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.

50\. That of it which is after that, until the collapse (an<i>g</i>âvi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the sovereignty of Irân.

51\. That of it which is also after that, until the end of the millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _and_ the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar.

52\. That of it which is also after that, until _the end_ of the millennium of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar _and_ the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh. <span id="p17"><sup><small>[ p. 17 ]</small></sup></span> 53\. That of it which is also after that, until the end of the millennium of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh and the arrival of Sôshâns.

54\. _And_ that of it from the arrival of the Triumphant Benefiter, _until_ the wonder _of_ the renovation _and_ future existence; a statement of them each separately.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (3:1) Nearly always spelt Zaratûkhsht in the MS., the counterpart of the Persian form Zaratuhsht or Zaraduhsht.

[^2]: (3:2) This Nik<i>ê</i><i>z</i>ŏ-î Vêh-dênô was evidently the name of an older book, from which the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> quotes much of its information on religious matters.

[^3]: (4:1) This preliminary matter occupies the whole of Chap. I.

[^4]: (4:2) The Yathâ-ahû-vairyô, or most sacred religious formula of the Parsis.

[^5]: (5:1) Reading hû-ahûîh, Av. hvanghevi. This section is one of the numerous quotations from the Pahlavi version of a lost Avesta text. When we are furnished with a complete Pahl.-Av. vocabulary, it will be possible to recover much of the original Avesta of such quotations, with some degree of certainty.

[^6]: (5:2) Pahl. garô<i>d</i>mânîg. Such glosses and comments, inserted by the Pahlavi translator, are always marked as parenthetical.

[^7]: (5:3) Pahl. hamâî-bâhar; it might be read hamâî-bîdâr, ‘ever vigilant.’

[^8]: (5:4) Reading vakhsh (= Pers. bakhsh), which is usually expressed by its Zvâri<i>s</i> equivalent gad<i>â</i> (traditionally gadman), and this means both ‘destiny’ and ‘the star, or glory, of destiny’ (Av. hvarenô, Pers. khura). Here the first letter of vakhsh is omitted, and this error converts the word into khayâ, the Zvâri<i>s</i> of <i>g</i>ân, ‘life.’ p. 6 This must have also occurred twice in a previous copy of the MS. in § 28, where the word is written <i>g</i>ân, ‘life,’ in the MS. B. In S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, Dk. VIII, xii, 20, vakhsh has been erroneously translated ‘word.’

[^9]: (6:1) The glorious destiny. §§ 9 and 10 have been previously translated in S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 411, 412.

[^10]: (6:2) Literally ‘man and woman’ who grew up as plants from the earth fertilized by Gâyômar<i>d</i>, the prototype of the human race; see Bd. XV, 1-5.

[^11]: (7:1) Mentioned in Visp. I, 9: ii, II: ix, 5, and recognized as a spirit in Pahl. Visp. i, 31 (Sp.). The spirit who assists the husbandman, see Études irân. ii, 201.

[^12]: (7:2) The MS. has ‘his,’ as in § 13, by mistake.

[^13]: (7:3) Two of the sacred Yathâ-ahû-vairyô formulas.

[^14]: (8:1) See Bd. XV, 24-26.

[^15]: (8:2) Grandsons of Sâmak, see Bd. XV, 28, and Sachau's Albîrûnî's Chronology of Ancient Nations, pp. 206, 212.

[^16]: (8:3) The idolators of Mâzandarân. See Yt. XIX, 26.

[^17]: (8:4) Called ‘seven powers’ in Bd. XXVIII, 15.

[^18]: (8:5) See Bd. XXXI, 2, and Yt. XIX, 28, 29.

[^19]: (9:1) See Bd. XXXI, 3-5, and Yt. XIX, 31-33.

[^20]: (9:2) In Vd. II, 4.

[^21]: (9:3) As detailed in Vd. II, 22-31, 40, 41.

[^22]: (10:1) See Bd. XXXI, 7, 8, and Yt. XIII, 131; XIX, 36.

[^23]: (10:2) The Arab usurper, or usurping dynasty, that conquered Yim in his old age; see Bd. XXXI, 5, 6.

[^24]: (10:3) See Yt. XIX, 37.

[^25]: (10:4) See Bd. XXXI, 9, 10.

[^26]: (10:5) Probably ‘destiny;’ the initial letter of vakhsh, ‘destiny,’ has been omitted, and this blunder converts the word into khayâ, ‘life.’

[^27]: (11:1) See note [^5] on preceding page.

[^28]: (11:2) Here spelt Nêresang and Mânû<i>s</i>îr. The former is the usual spiritual messenger of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and for the lineage of the latter see Bd. XXXI, 9-14. It appears that the glorious destiny was preserved by the angel Nêryôsang for some generations, and he conveyed it to the grandfather of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (see Chap. II, 70).

[^29]: (11:3) The three sons of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, among whom he divided his dominions, with the usual result of triumvirates.

[^30]: (11:4) See Bd. XXXI, 23 XXXIV, 6.

[^31]: (11:5) See Yt. XIX, 56-64, 77, 82, 93, and Bd. XXXI, 14, 15, 18, 21, 22, 35; XXXIV, 6; where the Av. form Frangrasyan is further p. 12 corrupted into Frâsîyâ<i>v</i>, as it is also hereafter in Chap. II, 68; Zs. XII, 3.

[^32]: (12:1) A famous hero whose exploits, like those of Hercules, have given birth to many legends; see S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 369-382.

[^35]: (12:4) Or Pâtâsrôbô, spelt Pâtsrôbô in Pahl. Vd. XX, 4 (Sp.).

[^36]: (12:5) Or Aîryêfshnîg; evidently the same as Virafsang in Bd. XXXI, 6, which is spelt Avirafshanêg and Âirafshanig in two MSS. of the Irânian Bundahi<i>s</i>. Hence we may conclude that Pâtakhsrôbô was a brother of Zâînîgâv, and a great-uncle of Dahâk; but how his daughters could have been married to the three sons of Frê<i>d</i>ûn, as stated in the <i>K</i>itradâ<i>d</i> Nask (see Dk. VIII, xiii, 9), is a chronological difficulty that throws doubt upon this identification.

[^37]: (12:6) The people of the primitive faith, who are supposed to have p. 13 already practised most of the duties upheld by Zarathu<i>s</i>tra before his appearance as a reformer.

[^38]: (13:1) Indicating that the Arab subjects of the king had revolted, because he favoured those of the primitive faith who, no doubt, gained further favour by putting down the rebellion.

[^39]: (13:2) Or it may be ‘fish priest,’ as karapŏ, ‘a heathen priest,’ and kerpŏ ‘shape, image,’ are written alike in Pahlavi letters.

[^47]: (14:6) See Bd. XVII, 7; Mkh. II, 95.

[^48]: (15:1) The Pahlavi transcripts of the Avesta names, Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-ereta, Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-nemangh, and Saoshyãs, of the three apostles expected to revive and renovate the Parsi religion in successive millenniums. According to the imperfect chronology of the Bundahi<i>s</i>, the millennium of Aushê<i>d</i>ar-mâh has now nearly one-fourth elapsed.
