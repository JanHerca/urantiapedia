## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER VIII.

1\. About the marvellousness which is manifested and is openly specified after the collapsing of the sovereignty of Irân _and_ the country of Irân; _also_ the end of the millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t and the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar the descendant of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^1].

2\. There is this marvellousness, really overthrowing the blessedness of the knowledge of former government, revealed by the Avesta about the ninth and tenth centuries, that which is an indicator of circumstances (aê<i>d</i>ûnŏîh) now visible, _such_ as the dispersion of the sovereignty of Irân from the country of Irân, the disturbance of just law _and_ custom, the predominance of _those with_ dishevelled hair [^2], _and_ the haughty profession of ecclesiastics [^3]. Also the collection and even connection of all their four systems of belief (v<i>â</i><i>v</i>arî-hastanŏ) [^4] together <span id="p95"><sup><small>[ p. 95 ]</small></sup></span> for the upper rank; the coming of _one_ working with the sacred beings to the inferior, the transient, and the captive of the period; and the dispersion and downfall of dependent and public men in their time.

4\. The disappearance of a disposition for wisdom from the foreigners _in_ the countries of Irân, which is an indication of shame _at_ the truth of the religion, and _at_ the praise, peace, liberality, and other goodness whose provision _has_ lodgement in a disposition for wisdom. 5. Also the abundance _of_ the decisions of apostasy, the falsehood, deceit, slander, quarrelsomeness, fraudulence, ingratitude, discord, stinginess, and other vileness whose real connection is a disposition to devour, neglecting heedfulness for the archangels of fire, water, and worldly _existence_ [^5]. 6. The oppressiveness of infidelity _and_ idol-worship, the scarcity _of_ freedom, the extreme predominance of avarice in the individuals (tanŏ) of mankind, the plenitude of different opinions about witchcraft, _and_ the much inclination of many for paralyzing the religion of the sacred beings.

7\. The annihilation of the sovereignty of mankind one over the other, the desolation of localities and settlements by severe actual distress, and the evil foreign potentates who _are_, one after the other, scattering the valiant; the destruction among cattle _and_ the defilement _of_ the spirit of enjoyment, owing to the lodgement of lamentation and weeping _in_ the countries of Irân, the clamour of the demon-worshipper in the country, _and_ the unobtainable stature, non-existent strength, blighted destiny, and short <span id="p96"><sup><small>[ p. 96 ]</small></sup></span> life of mankind. 8. Also the abundance of ordinances (âyinŏ) [^6] of various descriptions, the approval of the apostate among tyrants and the non-approval of the Zoti [^7] who is well-disposed and wise, the coming of the Zoti to want, _and_ all the other adversity, disruption, and running astray which _are_ over-powering even in districts _and_ localities of the countries of Irân.

9\. The maintenance of no ritual (<i>a</i>pandîh) of the religion of the sacred beings; the weakness, suffering, and evil habits of those _of_ the good religion; the lamentation and recantation (khûstûkîh) of the upholders of the religion; _and_ the wickedness and extermination of good works in most of the countries of Irân. to. Also much other misery in these two centuries is recounted in the Avesta, which passed away with them and is also now so visible therein, and manifestly occurs in them.

11\. This, too, is a statement (nisang-1) as to them, _which_ revelation mentions thus: ‘That is the age mingled with iron (that is, from every side they perceive _it is_ of iron) in which they bring forth into life him who is a sturdy praying apostate. 12. This is their sturdiness, that their approval is unobservant of both doctrines (âînakŏ); and this is their praying, that whenever _it is_ possible for them they shall cause misery to others; _also_ when an old man publicly advances into a crowd (galakŏ) of youths, owing to the evil times in which that man who is learned is born, they are unfriendly _to him_ (that is, they are no friends of the high-priests of the priestly assembly). 13. They are freely speaking (that is, <span id="p97"><sup><small>[ p. 97 ]</small></sup></span> they utter phrases smoothly), they are wicked and are fully maliciously talking, so that they shall make the statements of priests and high-priests useless; they also tear asunder the spiritual lordship _and_ priestly authority, and shall bring the ruler _and_ priestly authority into evil behaviour as vicious, but they bring together those _who are_ singular. 14. Anything they say is always mischief (agîh), and that district which had a judge they cast into the smiting precinct, into hell; it is misery without any intermission they shall inflict therein, till they attain unto damnation (darvandîh) through the recitation they persevere in, _both_ he who is the evil progeny disseminated by the apostate _and_ he who is the villainous wolf full of disaster _and_ full of depravity.’

15\. ‘Here _below_ they fight, the friend with him who is a friend, they also defraud (zîvênd) him of his own work (that is, whenever it is possible for them, they shall seize upon his property), and they give it to him from whom they obtain prosperity in return; if not, they seek him who is acting as a confederate (nishîn-gûn), and they make that other _one_ defraud the poor _man_ (so that they shall seize upon his property); they also cheat him when he shall make complaint. 16. I _shall_ not again produce such for thee, no friend here for him who is a friend, no brother for him who is a brother, no son for him who is a father, nor yet a father _for_ him who is a son; admonished, _but_ not convinced, they become the abode of the will of the place, so that they subsist in every single place where it is necessary for them _to be_, in each that is necessary for them they march on together, and on the way they reflect upon the path of blessedness and the <span id="p98"><sup><small>[ p. 98 ]</small></sup></span> manifold learning they utter owing to knowledge of me [^8].’

17\. ‘These three, our increase, learning, _and_ reward, we fully understand through the ascendancy _of_ him who is ignoble, _and_ through the downfall _of_ him who is noble _and_ superior to him of little thorough instruction who, in every thing, _will_ be at the foot of the tyrant. 18. Thinking of a priest _one_ becomes spiritual, thinking of a tyrant one becomes a Kavîg [^9]; a demon _in_ disposition is an incipient demon, a Kavîg _in_ disposition is himself attracted towards a youth.’

19\. Then, when character and wisdom recede from the countries of Irân (that is, they depart), so _that_ destitution and also winter, produced by demons who are worshipping the demon, rush together from the vicinity of disaster (vôighn) on to the countries of Irân, where even rain becomes scanty and pestilence is secretly advancing and deceiving, so that deaths become numerous; thus even _he_ of perverted wisdom, who is wicked, and the apostate also, who is unrighteous, rush together in companionship. 20. As what _one_ says they _all_ exclaim thus: ‘Consume and destroy, <i>O</i> ruler! for _it_ is to be consumed and destroyed by thee; destroy even the fire, consume even as food those who are the protection of the association enforcing _religious_ obedience, and those leading on the poor _man_ of the righteous dispensation by their guidance.’ 21. So that they shall make him thoroughly detached and smite him; <span id="p99"><sup><small>[ p. 99 ]</small></sup></span> likewise wisdom is the wealth they bring him, _and_ it is when property is being carried off by them, _that_ the wisdom conveyed by them arises.

22\. ‘And in that age, <i>O</i> righteous _one of_ the Spîtâmas! the coming of my desire is not purely for thee, nor is a thorough belief _of_ the departure of life, so that the bringing _and_ conducting of a speaker of promises (mit<i>r</i>agôv) is not necessary; those of the perfect apostate injure this discourse of thine, the Avesta and Zand, so that they shall make _it_ thoroughly weak; _and_ those of the perfect apostate harass their own souls, for love of the wealth which he produced.’

23\. And about the ninth and tenth centuries this also it says, that, ‘_as_ that age proceeds, this is what occurs, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! when many apostates utter the righteousness of priestly instruction and authority, _which_ is wickedness towards me, they cause begging for water, they wither vegetation, and they put down all excellence which is due to the manifestation of righteousness.’

24\. Again Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of him thus: ‘What do they so produce by that, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! when they cause begging for water, they wither vegetation, and they put down all excellence due to the manifestation of righteousness?’ 25. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘They so produce those _things_ among them, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! when they mention a greater reward for bantlings _and_ relations than that of their own souls (that is, they talk more concerning their allowance, where it is that for their own). 26. Moreover, they give to the Kîgs _and_ Karaps, for some repute _with_ the shepherd people of the husbandman, and with the swift-horsed people _of_ the warrior, as <span id="p100"><sup><small>[ p. 100 ]</small></sup></span> though they would provide us [^10] here _below_ with a large share of meat, that they would make our privilege, just as we [^10] here supply him with meat whom we render greatly precious. 27. The property _of_ even a wicked _man_ here _below_, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! in the average opinion among the disorganized (anârâstânŏ) is a dignified provision (that is, we form a strong opinion, the approval _of which_ is more to be asserted as _being_ the opinion of a poor righteous _man_, about a worthy righteous _man_ whose manifest righteousness is a homage (franâmi<i>s</i>nŏ) to duty _and_ good works).’

28\. Again he enquired of him thus: ‘Is there so perfect a manifestation here _below_, in the age of the worldly existence of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers (that is, is there a lodgement of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers in any one)?’ 29. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘It is so, among those men of mine [^11], <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! for here _below there_ are priests who are eloquent, and they, too, are men voluble and requisite in the embodied existence, all-beneficent and producing the destruction _of_ harm and the wizard; the people of the wicked tyrant say also regarding them, _that_, excepting thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! they rightly practise righteousness more largely, more powerfully, _and_ more volubly. 30. Blind are those _of_ the fiend, who are consulting with thee and are unaware of the tyrant; and observant are also those _of_ the fiend who consult with them and think of _their_ intelligence, and oppose the imbecile (anâkâsîh-aûmônd) apostate who is near them, so that <span id="p101"><sup><small>[ p. 101 ]</small></sup></span> they say [^12] this, namely: “_As to_ this which thou tellest us, _it_ is evidently not so as thou sayest,” of which they speak thus: “This duty of thy man is not mine (that is, it is not necessary for me to perform) nor thine (that is, it is not necessary even _for_ thee to perform), because _it_ is not this which is righteousness (that is, not a good work).” 31. For this _one_ is produced for these words _and_ thoughts of thine, _of_ whom thou, too, art aware, he who is whatever is here _below_ of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar [^13] of thoughtful controversy, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! for he brings into notice, through the intermingling of his own soul, _him_ who is righteous, or has not become _so_.’

32\. This, too, he says, namely: ‘_Of_ those, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! who come in the ninth and tenth centuries, I tell thee that they are _of_ the fiend _of_ Greed (Âzî); it is in _her_ womb that they are to be fashioned, they who assist those who would be vicious, through pre-eminence in leader-ship, or through excellence in subserviency.’

33\. And this, too, it says about them: ‘Those men are much to be destroyed;’ so it is said by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> that ‘these who are righteous, who carry away a corpse in this world, distress their fire, according to every high-priest [^14], and even long-flowing water; their bodies, which are really cesspools [^15] of a terrible character, become very assisting for the tormentors whose corpses are grievously wicked. 34. Concerning them I tell thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t <span id="p102"><sup><small>[ p. 102 ]</small></sup></span> of the Spîtâmas! that, in the ninth and tenth centuries, _there_ come those who are the brood of the fiend and the wound-producer (reshgâr) [^16] of the evil spirit; even one of them is more to be destroyed than ten demon-worshippers [^17]; they also produce extermination for these who are mine, for these of my religion, whom they, call a provision for destruction (that is, when it is possible to live in our way, and _ours_ are wicked, they diminish in superiority). 35. Even the iniquity that they shall commit in leadership and subserviency, the sin which is smiting thee, they call a trifle (khalakŏ), <i>O</i> pure _one_ of the Spîtâmas! and the smiter, they say, is _he_ whom these of thy religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers smite. 36. Besides thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! they distress those _duties_, too, which _are_ to be acquired _by_ thy people (lagânŏ); they think scornfully of this ceremonial of thine, scornfully of _thy_ worship, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _and_ they think scornfully of both the two blessed utterances [^18], the Avesta and Zand, which _were_ proclaimed _to_ thee _by_ me who am the most propitious of spirits. 37. They foster villainous outrage, _and_ they say the best work for mankind is immoderate fighting whose joyfulness is due to actions that are villainous; those, too, _that_ they exterminate are the existences _due to_ the spirits, they exterminate their own souls, they exterminate the embodied existences _of_ the world; _and_ they produce lamentation for the soul, and even the religion, as regards what is the mode of controlling orthodox people _together_ with the iniquitous of the same period.’

38\. And this, too, it says, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired <span id="p103"><sup><small>[ p. 103 ]</small></sup></span> of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘So what _shall_ we prescribe for those who are not capable, through _being_ poor (that is, they have no means), nor have they troops, nor a protector over _them_, and they have many persecutors?’ 39. _And_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘The strong-minded [^19] man, through understanding, is a token of the development of those who, not being in the army, are capable; their persecutors also are many, and the passing over of authority is owing to the iniquitous of the same period.’

40\. This, too, it says, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired thus: ‘Is he, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! who is a Kai _or_ a Karap, or he who is a most evil ruler in authority, mingled again with the good?’ 41. _And_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Even he [^20].’

42\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t _also_ enquired thus: ‘Is he, too, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! who is _one of_ those of the good sovereignty, mingled again with the good; or these, _such_ as the Kaîsar and Khâkân [^21]?’ 43. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Even that _former_, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t!’

44\. About the same iniquitous [^22] this, too, he says, namely: ‘When they are aware and understand about the sayings (galimakŏ) due to righteousness, they are pleased, so that a bribe seems better to them than duty and good works; they love the darkness _rather_ than light, the existence they love <span id="p104"><sup><small>[ p. 104 ]</small></sup></span> is the worst existence _rather_ than the best existence, _and_ they promote difficulty. 45. Concerning them, too, I tell thee that they are more to be destroyed than the leaping (shas<i>p</i>ŏ) serpent which is like a wolf _or_ a lion, and they ever advance in malice _and_ persecution from that _time_ till when that man arrives who is Kitrô-mêhônŏ [^23] the righteous, with the victorious club. 46. He _has_ marched with fifty triplets of men [^24] who are disciples, powerful and tall, looking after duties and ordinances, wide-shouldered, stout-armed, _and_ very hairy (kabed-milîh), so that their appearance is rough and of a black colour [^25], wherefore the demon and the iniquity _proceeding_ from him fear them. 47. He also smites the evil spirit, _together_ with _his_ creatures; _and_ those three manifest branches, that worship the fiend with simultaneous worship, are really these who march for eminent service on horses, even the Turkish demons with dishevelled hair; the Arab, and also She<i>d</i>âspô [^26] the ecclesiastical Arûman. <span id="p105"><sup><small>[ p. 105 ]</small></sup></span> 48\. ‘And he _has_ then to attract men, contented and discontented, mostly through the incentive of duty; he who is not contented (that is, not agreeing with what he says) contentedly pays respect to him, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! (so that he brings him into the religion). 49. Likewise, through that club, he makes _one_ press in the same manner; so that _one_ is distressed by his hand to hold _others in_ contempt, through the valiant arm and through the youthful bodily organs. 50. And he attaches power and triumph to his religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and through that power and triumph they become ever respected thenceforth, when those arrive who are the sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, who shall pro-duce the renovation in an existence undecaying _and_ immortal, hungerless and thirstless, the long-continued perpetuity including all.’

51\. And about the separation (burînakŏ) of the ten centuries in the one millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ the tidings of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar [^27], son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, it says also this, namely: ‘When that century fully elapses which is the first of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, from _the time when_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t came forward to _his_ conference, what is the separation of _this_ first century?’ 52. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘The sun conceals _itself_’ 53. ‘What is the separation after the second, third, fourth, _fifth_, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, _or_ tenth century?’ 54. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘The sun conceals _itself_.’

55\. Then, when thirty winters of the tenth century are unelapsed (that is, thirty winters _are_ remaining) a maiden, who is Shemig-abû [^28], walks up <span id="p106"><sup><small>[ p. 106 ]</small></sup></span> to the water; she that is the mother of that famous Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, and her former lineage is from Vohû-rô<i>k</i>ô-î Frahânyân [^29] in the family of Îsa<i>d</i>vâstar, the son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _that_ is brought forth by Arang. 56. Then she sits in that water _and_ drinks it, and she kindles in a high degree those germs which were the third _of_ the last that the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t _was_ dropping forth originally, and they introduce that son whose name is the Developer _of_ Righteousness [^30]. 57. Though _she_ is fifteen years old, the girl (kanîg) _has_ not before that associated with men [^31]; nor afterwards, when she becomes pregnant, _has she done so_ before the time when she gives birth.

58\. When that man becomes thirty years old, the sun stands still in the zenith (bâlistŏ) of the sky _for_ the duration of ten days _and_ ten nights, and it arrives again at that place where it _was_ first appointed by allotment, where it occupies one finger_\-breadth_ out of the four finger_\-breadths_, and it shines over all the regions which are seven. 59. So, too, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! of them themselves, their declaration is thus, that they know that the separation of the millennium, which this religion _has_ heard about by listening, is thus; _and_ of those who do not even then know, that it is something which is different.

60\. Then, when that man becomes thirty years old, he confers with the archangels, the good rulers _and_ good providers; _on_ the morrow, in the daylight of the day, _it is_ moreover manifest, when the _embodied_ existence is thus undistressed—without <span id="p107"><sup><small>[ p. 107 ]</small></sup></span> a Kaî and without a Karap (that is, not deaf and blind to the affairs of the sacred beings), and is to be appropriated (that is, has not made its own self apart _from_ the affairs of the sacred beings), and is produced full of life—that it has become extending (vâlân), and remains again great _in_ various places in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> where the good Dâîti [^32] is.

61\. These are the characteristics as regards the two centuries which are the ninth and tenth; the accuracy of what _was_ to come has continued _and_ this has happened, and both are declared as regards the accuracy which is stated on evidence as to what _will_ happen.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (94:1) The contents of Chaps. VII-XI have some connection with the following summary in Dk. VIII, xiv, 11, 12:—‘_And_ about the nature of the advancement of the people of the period, the separation _of_ centuries and millenniums, _and_ the signs, wonders, and perplexity which are manifested in the world at the end of each millennium in the world. Also as to the birth _and_ arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, at the end of the first millennium, and a report of him and his time, _and of_ the many destroyers of the organizers of the period between Zaratû<i>s</i>t's millennium and the coming of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar.’

[^2]: (94:2) This meaning for vi<i>g</i>ârdŏ-vars is chiefly based upon the use of vi<i>g</i>âr<i>d</i> in AV. XXXIV, 5, for a woman's hair being ‘combed.’ These invaders of Irân from the east, at the end of the first millennium of the religion, are mentioned in Byt. II, 22, 24, 28; III, 1, 6, 13. They are called ‘Turkish demons’ in § 47.

[^3]: (94:3) The Byzantine Christians.

[^4]: (94:4) Zoroastrianism, Muhammadanism, Christianity, and either Judaism or Idolatry.

[^5]: (95:1) Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô, Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i>, and Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>.

[^6]: (96:1) Or it may be hênô, ‘squadrons.’

[^7]: (96:2) The chief officiating priest in religious ceremonies.

[^8]: (98:1) So far, this statement (§§ 11-16) seems to be ascribed to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; but what follows (§§ 17, 18, 20) appears to represent the sentiments of some Irânians of those later times.

[^9]: (98:2) See Chap. II, 9 n.

[^10]: (100:1) The archangels.

[^11]: (100:2) Reading minam, instead of madam which is unintelligible here.

[^12]: (101:1) To the apostate.

[^13]: (101:2) See §§ 55-60 and Chap. I, 42 n. Here spelt Aûkhshê<i>d</i>ar.

[^14]: (101:3) Reading dastûr, instead of vastûr.

[^15]: (101:4) Pahl. mayâ-vakhdûn = Pers. âb-gîr.

[^16]: (102:1) Or it may be riyâgâr, ‘hypocrite.’

[^17]: (102:2) Or ‘idolators.’

[^18]: (102:3) Pahl. vâfrîgânîh = Av. urvâtâ.

[^19]: (103:1) Assuming that tôshtŏ-mîni<i>s</i>nŏ is a miswriting of toshînŏ-mini<i>s</i>nŏ.

[^20]: (103:2) That is, after expiating his misdeeds by his allotted punishment. The last thirteen Pahlavi words of §§ 42, 43 are also added here by mistake in the MS.

[^21]: (103:3) The Byzantine emperor and the sovereign Khân of the invaders from the east.

[^22]: (103:4) Mentioned in §§ 37, 39.

[^23]: (104:1) So spelt here, but in Dk. IX, xli, 6, it is <i>K</i>itrag-mêhônŏ, and other slight variations occur in the best MSS. of Bd. XX, 7, 31; XXIX, 5; Byt. III, 25, 26; Dd. XC, 3; but they can all be traced to an, original <i>K</i>itrô-mêhan = Av. <i>K</i>ithrô-maêthanem, ‘of the racial home,’ a title applied both to the river and the immortal sacerdotal ruler of Kangd<i>e</i><i>z</i>. The latter is supposed to be Pêshyôtanŏ, a son of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, who is expected to restore religious rites in Irân and throughout the world.

[^24]: (104:2) With 150 disciples, as stated in Byt. III, 27, 29, 42. Here it is written levat<i>â</i> 50 3-gabrâân.

[^25]: (104:3) Byt. III, 27, 29, 42, states that they wear black marten fur.

[^26]: (104:4) In Byt.
