## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1]. CHAPTER XIX.

1\. About his interfering talk (andarg-gôbi<i>s</i>nŏîh) with the iniquitous, this also is declared, that one <span id="p150"><sup><small>[ p. 150 ]</small></sup></span> day Dûrêsrôbô [^1] the Karap, as _it were_ from the same five brethren, came out to the house of Pôrûshaspô; _and_ Pôrûshaspô placed a bowl (<i>g</i>amakŏ) of mare's milk before _him_, and spoke to him thus: ‘Consecrate _it_.’

2\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t expostulated with Pôrûshaspô thus: ‘I _will_ consecrate it.’ 3. Pôrûshaspô spoke thus: ‘He should consecrate, and the grace is to be offered up by you [^2];’ _and_ as many as three times _they_ mutually disputed.

4\. Then up stood Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and his right foot struck at the bowl and emptied it, and he spoke thus: ‘I reverence righteousness, I reverence the righteous _and_ the poor, men _and_ women; do thou, <i>O</i> Pôrûshaspô! prepare a portion for him in whom _there_ is worthiness.’

5\. And Dûrêsrôbô spoke unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘As _some_ of my portion _of_ daily _food was_ first thrown away by thee, it is I who _will_ bring _it_ on both thy lives, and _will_ utterly destroy thee.’ 6. Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke interruptingly [^3] thus: ‘With complete mindfulness I _will_ look upon thee with both eyes, and _will_ utterly destroy thee.’

7\. And, for a long time, they constantly looked, one at the other, with unshrinking gaze; _but_ the divine nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is victorious over the witchcraft of that _wizard, and_ Dûrêsrôbô is further disturbed; he also asked for _his_ horse _and_ spoke thus: ‘On account of this _boy, it_ is impossible for me to stay.’ <span id="p151"><sup><small>[ p. 151 ]</small></sup></span> 8\. He sat upon the horse, _and_ when he had gone a little _way_, he fell off from the horse, through severe distress, and died; and the children of his children's children have died upon the same spot [^1].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (150:1) So spelt in Zs., but Dûrâsrôbô in Dk.; also the former has always Pôrûshaspô, but the latter Pôrûshâspô. Compare the same legend in Dk. VII, iii, 34-45.

[^2]: (150:2) Pahl. ‘val<i>â</i> aê y<i>a</i><i>z</i>ê<i>d</i>ŏ, <i>a</i>fê<i>d</i> vâ<i>g</i> dahi<i>s</i>nŏ.’

[^3]: (150:3) Or ‘inwardly’

[^1]: (151:1) Probably meaning that he died childless.
