## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER XXI.

1\. About his coming to thirty years of age _it is_ thus declared, that _on_ the lapse of thirty years onwards from _his_ appearance, _on_ the day Anêrân of the month Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^1], he had proceeded in that direction _in_ which _there_ occurred the so-called festival of spring (<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>nŏ-î vahâr) [^2], forty-five days beyond <span id="p155"><sup><small>[ p. 155 ]</small></sup></span> new-year's day, _at_ a place become specially noted, where people went, from many quarters, out to the place of festival (<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>nŏ<i>k</i>âr).

2\. When Zaratû<i>s</i>t, for the sake of going off to the festival place, halted on the way in walking, he chanced upon a solitary (aêvatâk) plain, and he saw, in a vision, that mankind and a much-adorned worldly _existence were_ kept away to the north, so that all the people in the earth have become fully manifest in the north. 3. And he at the head (pavan têkh) of them _was_ Mê<i>d</i>yômâh, son of Arâstâî [^3], _even_ as Ârâstâî was brother of Pôrûshaspô [^4]; Mê<i>d</i>yômâh _was_ the leader of all mankind _who_ have gone out to the presence of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and he became _their_ guide, so that first Mê<i>d</i>yômâh _and_ afterwards the whole material existence are attracted.

4\. And about his coming out to the conference, _on_ the lapse of those forty-five days, _at_ the place of festival _at_ dawn _on_ the day Dadvô [^5]\-pavan-Mit<i>r</i>ô of the month A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô. 5. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t, for the purpose of squeezing the Hôm, went forth to the bank of the water of the Dâîtîh, because it is the river [^6] of the conference for the supremacy (patîh) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ is the water of _Â_<i>v</i>ân [^7] which has consisted of four channels (bêtâ). 6. Zaratû<i>s</i>t also <span id="p156"><sup><small>[ p. 156 ]</small></sup></span> passed on through it; and its first _channel_ was up to the ankle [^8], the second up to the knee, the third up to the parting of the two thighs, and the fourth up to the neck. 7. This was an indicator that his religion comes four times to supremacy; the manifestations of which are through Zaratû<i>s</i>t, Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, and Sôshâns [^9].

8\. When he came up from the water, and put on his clothes, he then saw the archangel Vohûmanô [^10] in the form (âyûînakŏ) of a man, handsome, brilliant, and elegant, who wore his hair curve-tailed [^11], because the curved tail is an indication of duality; _who_ had put on _and_ wore a dress like silk, than which _there_ was no making anything superior, for it was light itself; and his height was nine _times_ as much as _that of_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

9\. He also enquired of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^12] thus: ‘Who mayst thou be, and from whom of them mayst thou be? also what is mostly thy desire, and the endeavour in thy existence?’ 10. And he replied thus: ‘I am Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas; among the existences righteousness is more _my_ desire, and my wish is that I _may_ become aware _of_ the will of the sacred beings, and _may_ practise so much righteousness as they exhibit to me in the pure existence.’

11\. And Vohûmanô directed Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^13] thus: ‘Do <span id="p157"><sup><small>[ p. 157 ]</small></sup></span> thou proceed to an assembly of the spirits!’ 12. As much as Vohûmanô walked on in nine steps, Zaratû<i>s</i>t _did_ in ninety steps, and when he had gone ninety steps farther than him, he saw the assembly of the seven archangels. 13. When he came within twenty-four feet of the archangels, he then did not see his own shadow on the ground, on account of the great brilliancy of the archangels; the position of the assembly was in Iran, and in the direction of the districts on the bank of the water of the Dâîtîh. 14. Zaratû<i>s</i>t offered homage, and spoke thus: ‘Homage to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and homage to the archangels!’ _and_ he went forward _and_ sat down in the seat of the enquirers.

15\. As to the asking of questions by Zaratû<i>s</i>t, he enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: ‘In the embodied world which is the first of the perfect ones, which the second, _and_ which the third?’ 16. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> replied thus: ‘The first perfection is good thoughts, the second good words, _and_ the third good deeds.’

17: Zaratû<i>s</i>t also enquired thus: ‘Which _thing_ is good, which is better [^14], and which is the best of all habits?’ 18. _And_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> replied thus: ‘The title [^15] of the archangels is good, the sight of them is better, and carrying out their commands is the best of all habits.’

19\. Afterwards he demonstrated the duality of the original evolutions (bûn ga<i>s</i>tânŏ) [^16], and the divergence in each control, _and_ spoke thus: ‘Of those spirits, he who _was_ wicked preferred the <span id="p158"><sup><small>[ p. 158 ]</small></sup></span> practice which is iniquitous (Aharman's desire was _for_ the practice which is iniquitous), _and_ the spirit of righteousness, the propitious (Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>) prefers righteousness [^17].’ 20. Specially he demonstrated the divergence in each control of the exhibitors of light, and he spoke thus: ‘Neither our thoughts [^18], nor desires, nor words, nor deeds, nor religion, nor spiritual faculties _agree_ [^19]_; he_ who is loving light, his place is with the luminaries; _and he_ who is _loving_ darkness is with the dark ones [^20].’

21\. On the same day also, his omniscient wisdom appeared three times: as regards the same first questions, it pointed out the sky in great light and splendour, and in its exhibition _of_ the prevention _of_ darkness, at the sight of which _it becomes_ an opposing existence as regards that darkness. 22. And it exhibited its own appearance proportionally _to_ the sky, when it kept its head at the summit of the sky, _its_ feet at the bottom of the sky, and _its_ hands reached to both sides of the sky; the sky also kept _it_ covered, in the manner of a garment.

23\. The six archangels [^21] were manifest by their similar stature (ham-ba<i>s</i>nîh), in such manner that it is obvious each one successively is apparently one finger's _breadth_ shorter than the other. 24. The archangels exhibited three kinds _of_ achievement <span id="p159"><sup><small>[ p. 159 ]</small></sup></span> (pasâkhtan) [^22] for the religion; first, _by_ means of fires, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t walked three steps on _them_, with _the words_, ‘good thoughts, good words, and good deeds,’ and _was_ not burnt; and secondly, hot metal is poured on to _his_ chest, cooled thereby, and, grasping _it_ with _his_ hand, he held _it_ for the archangels. 25. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘After _the establishment of_ the pure religion, when a dispute occurs in the religion, those who are thy disciples _will_ pour _it_ on to a spiritual lord, they _will_ take _it_ up with the hand, _and will_ thoroughly believe in him who is over the whole embodied existence.’ 26. The third _was_ cutting with a knife, _and_ the vital parts (ahvôn) becoming visible, which are inside the abdomen, _with_ a flowing forth of blood; and, after the hands are rubbed over _it_, it became healed. 27. And this is pointed out, namely: ‘Thy and thy [coreligionists’](./Erratum) accepting of the pure religion is, as to the steadfast _in_ other religions, such that, through such-like burning of fire, pouring of hot metal, and through an operation with a sharp instrument, _there_ is no perversion from the good religion.’
