## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK V. CHAPTER IV.

1\. About the selectness and perfection of the race of Irân, that is, how the destroyer and the mingling of defects came into the creation, first into the distribution of the race \[of mankind\] [^1] from the children of Sîyâmak [^2], _and_ good intellect, good disposition, <span id="p128"><sup><small>[ p. 128 ]</small></sup></span> proper affection, proper praise, proper modesty, observance of hope, liberality, truth, generosity, good friendship, _and_ other capability, glory, and proper duty are more particularly included for Fravâk [^3], and again altered for frontier peoples.

2\. Such-like goodness and glory, again, through selection from a promiscuous origin—even till the coming on of various new contaminations, from the demons, among the children of Fravâk—_were_ for Hâôshâng and Vâêgere<i>d</i> [^4], as Hâôshâng through superior glory _was_ ruler of the world, and Vâêgere<i>d</i> through provincial government (dahyûkânîh) became the cultivator and cherisher of the world; and their well-destined descendants [^5] aggrandized the race of the monarchs among the well-born provincial governors (dahyûkân).

3\. In union, such-like glory and goodness proceeded, mutually connected, in various ages as settled by the annals (mâ<i>d</i>îgân), and the frontiers of Atûr [^6] are penetrated; also in various annals _there_ were in succession _such men_ as Tâkhmôrup, Yim, Frê<i>d</i>ûn the Âspîgân, and Aîrî<i>k</i> of Irân, the progenitor of Mânû<i>s</i>, Mânû<i>s</i>\-khvârnar, and Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^7].

4\. And, besides including this one, who _was_ a monarch of superior glory, and other monarchs _such_ as _are_ also in the same race [^8], the Kayâns [^9] _were_ <span id="p129"><sup><small>[ p. 129 ]</small></sup></span> chosen. 5. Even thus, as regards the Kayâns, the annals _have_ always to consider him who is monarch as the right _one_, who is a fellow-descendant _of_ the lineage, and in whom the glory is residing.

6\. The creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> has informed Nêryôsang [^10], his own reminder, _that_ a similar instance is the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>tship, and the glory of the religion due to the same; also many other reasons, which _are_ recountable, _are_ declared in the Avesta, indications known only _to_ an Irânian person of the best lineage. 7. And this, too, he has said, namely: ‘Great glory and goodness of this description _are_ appropriatable by the same race, and _are_ even now [^11] visibly manifest.’

8,. About what _are_ the requirements of the tribe of those who call _this_ really their Gyêmarâ and how _they are_ effected by our acquaintance with revelation, that is, _by_ much recitation of it; only, several occasions (yâvar 1-<i>k</i>and) are necessary in these times. 9. Also action and precaution _are_ possible for them, and among the actions and precautions _one_ is to assume more especially law and custom, and whatever _was_ perverted by us and again made true; and, as to those taught, several persons who _are_ intellectual, seeking means, and friends of the soul, _have_ come to teach complete delusions to them; also for the same tribe and whomever it is proper to teach, when it is necessary for them, even a worldly <span id="p130"><sup><small>[ p. 130 ]</small></sup></span> priestly authority is guiding for _that_ same tribe, because he has come [^12].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (127:8) B omits the words in brackets.

[^2]: (127:9) Son of Masyê, called Sâmak in Dk. VII, i, 15.

[^3]: (128:1) Son of Sîyâmak; he was progenitor of the fifteen undeformed races of mankind (see Bd. XV, 26, 30, 31).

[^4]: (128:2) Dk. VII, i, 16-18.

[^5]: (128:3) K43 has ‘children.’

[^6]: (128:4) Probably Assyria; but it is possible to read atval as Ar. a<i>t</i>val, and to translate ‘ancient frontiers.’

[^7]: (128:5) For the foregoing names see Dk. VII, i, 19-30; ii, 70.

[^8]: (128:6) Such as Aûzôbô in Dk. VII, i, 31.

[^9]: (128:7) From Kaî-Kobâ<i>d</i> to Kai-Khûsrô, as stated in Dk. VII, i, 33-40.

[^10]: (129:1) The usual messenger of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, see Dk. VII, iv, 84, 85.

[^11]: (129:2) B has ‘even anew,’ by writing kevan backwards, which converts the word into navak. From Chap. I, 7 to this point, the compiler could have found very little of his materials in a Jewish MS., excepting such as had been recently obtained from Persian sources.

[^12]: (130:1) It would seem that the tribe professed a different religion, but one that bore some resemblance to the Parsi faith in certain essential particulars. The remaining five-sixths of Dk. V are devoted to a miscellaneous collection of religious subjects, resembling a Rivâyat.
