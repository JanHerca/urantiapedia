## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1]. CHAPTER XVI.

1\. About the trials (aûzmâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) which occurred <span id="p145"><sup><small>[ p. 145 ]</small></sup></span> to him whose practice _was_ lawful, and the signs of prophecy _that_ are seen therein, _it_ is thus declared, namely; ‘Another day, when _the child had_ been born, Pôrûshaspô called one of those five brothers of the race of Karaps, and spoke thus: "Fully observe the marks _and_ specks of my son Zaratû<i>s</i>t."’

2\. _The Karap_ went _and_ sat down before Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and the head of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _was_ thereupon severely twisted by him, in order that he should be killed; _but_ he, being fearless, watched the wizards whose terror _was_ distressing [^1]. 3. As _it was_ in those ten nights for hospitality, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sent Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, Arêdvisûr, and Ar<i>d</i>âî-fravar<i>d</i> [^2] down to the earth, by way of female _care;_ thereupon no variation occurred to _the child_, and, further, the hand of that Karap _was_ withered [^3], and that wizard demanded the life [^4] of Zaratû<i>s</i>t from Pôrûshaspô for the harm from him, which sprang _upon_ him_self_ from his own action.

4\. _At_ the same time Pôrûshaspô took Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and gave him to the Karap, that he might do with him according to his own will. 5. He seized him and threw him out, at the feet of the oxen who were going on a path to the water; the leader of that drove of oxen stood still in _his_ vicinity, and 150 oxen, which walked behind it, _were_ kept away from him thereby; _and_ Pôrûshaspô took _him_, and carried him back to the house [^5].

6\. Also the second day, _the Karap_ threw _him_ out <span id="p146"><sup><small>[ p. 146 ]</small></sup></span> at the feet of the horses; and the leader of the horses stood still in the vicinity of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and 150 horses, which walked behind it, _were_ kept away from him thereby; _and_ Pôrûshaspô took _him_, and carried him back to the house [^1].

7\. Also the third day, firewood is gathered together by _the Karap_, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t is deposited on _it_ by him, the fire is stirred up by him, yet _with_ the same result (ham-bûn-i<i>k</i>), the _child_ is not burnt by it, and those marks, which existed _and were_ made upon him, _were_ a preservation from it [^2].

8\. And the fourth day, he is thrown by _the Karap_ into the lair (âshyânakŏ) of a wolf; the wolf was not in the lair, _and_ when it wished to go back to the den (sûrâkŏ), it stopped when it came in front of some radiance, _in_ the manner of a mother, at the place _where its_ cub was. 9. In the night, Vohûmanô and Srôsh the righteous brought a woolly (kûrû<i>s</i>akŏ) sheep _with_ udder _full_ of milk into the den, and it gave milk to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, in digestible draughts (guvârakŏ guvârakŏ), until day_light_ [^3].

10\. In the dawn, the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t went to that place, in the expectation that it _would_ be necessary to bring a skeleton out of the den, and the woolly _sheep_ came out _and_ ran away; his mother supposed that it was the wolf, and she spoke thus: ‘Thou _hast_ devoured to repletion; mayst. thou endure for ever without it!’ 11. She went farther, _and_ when she saw Zaratû<i>s</i>t quite safe, she then took him. up and spoke thus: ‘I _will_ not give _thee_ to any one during life, not though both the provinces of Râgh and Nô<i>d</i>ar _should_ arrive here together [^4].’ <span id="p147"><sup><small>[ p. 147 ]</small></sup></span> 12\. Because these _princes were_ among the spiritual from two provinces which _are_ in Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>akân, such as _are_ at sixty leagues (parasang) from <i>K</i>îst: Zaratû<i>s</i>t arose from Râgh, and Vi<i>s</i>tâsp from Nô<i>d</i>ar. 13. And of these two provinces, Râgh was according to the name of Êrikŏ, _son_ of Dûrêsrôbô, _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [1](sbe4725_htm.html), from whom arose the race of Zaratû<i>s</i>t: and Nô<i>d</i>ar _was_ according to the name of Nô<i>d</i>ar, _son_ of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, from whom arose the race of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.
