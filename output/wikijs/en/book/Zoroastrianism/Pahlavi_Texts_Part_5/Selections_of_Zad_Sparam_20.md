## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1]. CHAPTER XX.

1\. About the righteousness of his desires _it_ is thus declared, that when he became fifteen years old, the sons of Pôrûshaspô demanded a portion from _their_ father, and their portions are allotted out by him. 2. Among the clothes _there_ was a girdle, the width of which _was_ four finger_\-breadths_; and of the four [^2] portions around and the girdle, which it was possible to bring forth, Zaratû<i>s</i>t selected _the latter_ and tied it on him_self_. 3. This was owing to the precepts (parvânakân) of Vohûmanô who came into his reason at birth; as to whatever is not the custom _his_ mind _was_ now quite closed, and in that which is the custom _it was_ impetuously exercised by him.

4\. About _his_ compassionate disposition and the streams of the Arag province [^3], this also is declared, <span id="p152"><sup><small>[ p. 152 ]</small></sup></span> that _there_ was a river, _and_ from them the body of a naked woman floated, for the reason that, on account of the strength and swiftness of the river, a woman, except when she _was_ quite naked while she was in it, was not able to pass; and an old person, such as he who is of seventy years _and_ is called in revelation a Hânô [^1], for want of power (apâ<i>d</i>îyâvandîh râî), was not able to go back through it by his own strength. 5. Zaratû<i>s</i>t came on to the bank of the water, _and_ of women _and_ old people seven persons had come, and are passed on by him, _in_ the manner of a bridge [^2]; it was an emblem of the _spiritual_ performers [^3] of bridging work, that is, of those providing a passage to heaven.

6\. About his liberal disposition _it_ is declared, that the fodder of Pôrûshaspô, which was stored for the beasts _of burden_, _was_ not _only_ for the beasts of Pôrûshaspô in a scarcity, but _also_ for distribution among the beasts of others, which, owing to their hunger on account of the scarcity, then constantly ate off the tails of each other; _and it was_ given to them plentifully.

7\. About his abandoning worldly desire, _and_ his laying hold of righteousness of way, this, too, is declared, that when he became twenty years old, without the consent (<i>b</i>ên akâmakîh) of _his_ father and mother, he wandered forth _and_ departed from <span id="p153"><sup><small>[ p. 153 ]</small></sup></span> _their_ house, and openly enquired thus: ‘Who is most desirous of righteousness _and_ most nourishing the poor?’ 8. And they spoke thus: ‘He who is the youngest (kêhistô) son of Aûrvaîtŏ-dih [^1] the Tûr, who every day gives an iron caldron (<i>g</i>âmak), which is the height of a horse, full of bread and milk _and_ other food, unto the poor.’ 9. Zaratû<i>s</i>t went on to that place, and with his co-operation, for the nourishment of the poor, some of the chief men performed duty by carrying forth food for the poor.

10\. About his compassion, not only upon mankind, but also his other creatures, this, too, is declared, that a bitch _was_ seen by him, which had given birth to five [^2] puppies, and it was three days then that she _had_ not obtained food [^3]. 11. Whomever she saw, she then advanced her mouth towards him, and became as it were prostrated; Zaratû<i>s</i>t provided a remedy, _by_ swiftly bringing up bread for her, _but_ when _he was_ bringing it she had expired.

12\. About his own desire for the good quality [^4] of a wife, on account also of the will of _his_ parents, _and his_ not mingling his own seed before a suitable obtainment, this, too, is declared, that when his father sought a wife for him, Zaratû<i>s</i>t argued with the bride (nêsh<i>â</i>) thus: ‘Show me thy face, so that I may find out (barkhâm) its kind of appearance, _and_ this, too, whether its appearance _be_ undesirable, or shall not be gratifying;’ and the bride turned away her face from him. 13. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: <span id="p154"><sup><small>[ p. 154 ]</small></sup></span> ‘Whoever takes away a sight from me, does not practise respect for me.’

14\. About his _having_ accepted progress even from the iniquitous, _that_ listened sinfully desirous, who accepted so much advantageousness as _was_ manifest, this, too, is declared, that he came into an assembly who were well known in the place for much knowledge, and he enquired of them thus: ‘What is most favourable for the soul?’ 15. And they spoke thus: ‘To nourish the poor, to give fodder to cattle, to bring firewood to the fire, to pour Hôm juice into water, and [^1] to worship many demons with words, with the words which are called revelation (dênô).’ 16. Then Zaratû<i>s</i>t nourished the poor, foddered the cattle, brought firewood to the fire, and squeezed Hôm into water, _but_ never are any demons whatever worshipped with words _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (151:2) The MSS. have ‘three,’ but there were five sons (Chap. XV, 5), and the numbers are written in ciphers which are very easily corrupted.

[^3]: (151:3) Pahl. ‘Aragistân ôdhâvŏ (T dhâ)’ = ‘odhâ-î Arangîstânŏ’ of, P. Vd. I, 77 (Sp.); compare Av. ‘upa aodhaêshu Rang,hay<i>a</i>u,’ of Vd. I, 19; Yt. XII, 18. In the Irânian Bd. XX, 8 we are told that ‘the Arang river is that of which _it_ is said that it comes out from Albûr<i>z</i> in the land of Sûrak, which they call also Sham (Shim); and it passes on through the land of Êgiptôs, which they call also Misr, and there they call it the swift river Êgipitôis.’ It is p. 152 one of the two mythical rivers which were supposed to bound the Irânian world, and seems to represent the Aras as a northern and the Nile as a western boundary. Arang often becomes Arag in Pahlavi, just as sang becomes sag.

[^1]: (152:1) Av. hanô in Vd. III, 19, 20 &c.

[^2]: (152:2) Probably holding each other's hands.

[^3]: (152:3) The sacred beings who assist the righteous souls to pass over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge.

[^1]: (153:1) See Dk. VII, iv, 7 n.

[^2]: (153:2) T has ‘seven,’ but this difference may have arisen from an erroneous mode of writing the ciphers in T.

[^3]: (153:3) T has ‘a bone for food.’

[^4]: (153:4) T has ‘good child-bearing.’

[^1]: (154:1) T inserts ‘not’ here, which is clearly wrong, and must have been introduced by some copyist who did not observe that the assembly, though learned, was sinful; and that the object of the anecdote is to exhibit Zaratû<i>s</i>t's ability to distinguish between good works and sin, when still untaught by the sacred beings.
