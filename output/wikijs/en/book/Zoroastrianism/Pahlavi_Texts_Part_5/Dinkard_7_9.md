## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER IX.

1\. About the marvellousness which is after the end of the millennium of Zaratû<i>s</i>t and the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, until the end of the millennium of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar and the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh; and as to tidings of the same period.

2\. The marvellousness of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar as to birth [^2], glory of person, sayings and actions; the standing of the sun ten days amid the sky [^3]; the perishing of the fiend of the four-legged race; the production of a three-spring cloudless influence [^4] for vegetation; the weakening of superfluity _and_ destitution; the extreme strengthening of alliance; the gratification _due to_ the good friendship of foreigners; the great increase of the wisdom of religion; and the praise <span id="p108"><sup><small>[ p. 108 ]</small></sup></span> of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar's smiting _with_ a serpent-scourge of several kinds _in_ the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers.

3\. The mightiness of the resources in the fifth century of the same millennium; the manifestation of the wizard Mahrkûs [^1] for seven years, in the year which is reported in all the regions which are seven; the coming on _and_ arrival of the winter of Mahrkûs, the perishing of most _of_ mankind _and_ animals within three winters and in the fourth, through the awfulness _of_ those winters _and_ the witchcraft of Mahrkûs; and the dying away of Mahrkûs of scanty progeny (ga<i>s</i>ûkŏ-zahi<i>s</i>nŏ), during the fourth winter, through the Dâhmân Âf<i>r</i>în [^2]. 4. The opening of the enclosure made by Yim, the coming of mankind _and_ animals therefrom, _and_ the complete progress of mankind and animals again, arising specially from them.

5\. After those winters, the abundant and great increase in the milk of cattle, and the abundant nourishment _of_ mankind by milk; the less distress of body _in_ cattle, the fullness and prosperity _of_ the world, the celebrity of assembled mankind, _and_ the great increase of liberality. 6. Also the feebleness <span id="p109"><sup><small>[ p. 109 ]</small></sup></span> _of_ poverty among mankind, _just_ like what revelation mentions thus: ‘Even so he, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! though he be more unfortunate than he who is accepting _from him_, is like the creator whose bounty of permanent liberality does thus, in the embodied existence, remain in his dwelling.’

7\. And this, too, it says, namely: ‘When that winter passes away, _of_ which _it is_ said that _it is_ boisterous and destructive [^1], then a wild beast, black and wide-travelling, walks up to the. Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, and thus it thinks, that they _who_ worship Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a _will_ therefore not finally hate us more than him who is their own progeny, the son whom they thus bring up _as_ a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper here _below, in_ fondness _and_ freedom from malice towards well-yielding cattle.

8\. ‘Then Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô calls out to the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers from the upper region, _and_ thus he speaks: “You are for the worship of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a; let no one _of you_ become such a slaughterer of cattle as the slaughterers you have been before. 9. Recommend increase in gifts, recommend neighbourliness in person; are you worshipping Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a? do you slaughter cattle? do you slaughter those of them which give you assistance, which speak to you thus: ‘On account of your helpfulness _one_ tells you that you are worshipping Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a _and_ you _may_ eat?’ I _am_ in neighbourliness before that, until _the time_ when you exclaim: ‘Mine _are_ the serpent and toad.’

10\. ‘“And you recommend increase, you recommend neighbourliness, _and_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers slaughter cattle, even those of them who give them <span id="p110"><sup><small>[ p. 110 ]</small></sup></span> assistance, so that you are worshipping Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a _and_ you eat; I _am_ in neighbourliness before that, until _the time_ when you exclaim: ‘Mine _are_ the serpent _and_ toad.’

11\. ‘"Contentedly the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers slaughter cattle, contentedly the cattle of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers let _them_ butcher [^1], and contented are the cattle when they do not butcher _them;_ contentedly the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers eat cattle, _and_ contented _are the cattle_ when they eat them. 12. And then, when _there_ are spirits, the slaughterers and whatever they slaughter, the butchers and whatever they butcher, _and_ the eaters and whatever they eat _are_ alike watched _by them_."’

13\. And this, too, it says, namely: ‘When that century fully elapses, which is the fifth in the second millennium as regards the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, then of all those who _are_ upon the earth, the existences which are both wicked and righteous, two-thirds _in_ the land of Irân are righteous and one-_third_ wicked; and so likewise the Tûrânians _and_ those who _are_ around Irân remain non-Irânian around Irân; the chief increase in dwellings here _below_, of those in the embodied existence, remains _just_ as now.’

14\. And this, too, it says, namely: ‘When that millennium _has_ fully elapsed, which is the first of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, what is the separation after the first century?’ 15. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘The sun conceals _itself_.’ 16. ‘And what is the separation after the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, _or_ tenth <span id="p111"><sup><small>[ p. 111 ]</small></sup></span> century?’ 17. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘The sun conceals _itself_.’

18\. Then, when thirty winters of the tenth century _are_ unelapsed (arânako), a maiden, who is Shapîr-abû [^1], walks up to the water; _she_ that is the mother of that good Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh [^2], and her former lineage is from Vôhû-rô<i>k</i>ô-î Frahânyân [^3] in the family of Îsa<i>d</i>vâstar, the son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _that_ is brought forth by Aran<i>g</i>: 19. Then she sits in that water _and_ drinks _it, and_ she kindles in a high degree those germs which were the second _of_ the last that the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t _was_ dropping forth originally, and they introduce that son whose name is the Developer _of_ Worship [^4] (that is, he augments liberality). 20. Though fifteen years old, the damsel (zihânakŏ) _has_ not before that associated with men; nor yet afterwards, when she becomes pregnant, _has she done so_ before the time when she gives birth [^5].

21\. When that man becomes thirty years old, the sun stands still in the zenith of the sky _for_ the duration of twenty days _and_ nights [^6], _and_ it shines over all the regions which are seven. 22. So, too, the declaration of them themselves is that they know <span id="p112"><sup><small>[ p. 112 ]</small></sup></span> that the separation of the millennium, which this religion _has_ heard about by listening, is even thus; _and_ of those who do not even then know, that it is something which is different.

23\. When that man becomes thirty years old, he confers with the archangels, the good rulers _and_ good providers; _on_ the morrow, in the daylight of the day, _it is_ moreover manifest, when the embodied existence is _thus_ undistressed—without a Kai and without a Karap (that is, not blind _and_ not deaf to the affairs of the sacred beings), and is to be appropriated (that is, has not made its own self apart _from_ the affairs of the sacred beings), and is produced full of life—that it has become extending, and is again great _in_ various places in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> where the good Dâîtî _is_.

## Footnotes

[^2]: (107:2) See Chap. VIII, 55-57.

[^3]: (107:3) See Chap. VIII, 58.

[^4]: (107:4) Pahl. ‘3-zarem<i>â</i><i>ê</i> an-<i>a</i><i>v</i>argarîh.’

[^1]: (108:1) Av. Mahrkûsha of Westergaard's Fragment VIII, 2, who is evidently a wizard or fiend; according to Pahl. Vd. II, 49 (Sp.) the evil winter which was foretold to Yim is called the winter of Markûs. In later times this name has been understood as Heb. Malkôs, ‘autumnal rain;’ so the idea of the fatal freezing winter of Mahrkûs, the intender of death, was abandoned for that of the deluging rain of Malkôs, as in Mkh. XXVII, 28. In Dd. XXXVII, 94, both snow and rain are mentioned as produced by Mahrkûs or Markûs (as it is always written in Pahlavi), and in Sd. IX, 5 only his name is stated. The most complete account of him is given in our text.

[^2]: (108:2) The _Â<i>f</i>r_în of the Ameshâspends.

[^1]: (109:1) The Pahlavi version of Av. ‘stakhrahê meretô zaya’ in Westerg. Frag. VIII, 2.

[^1]: (110:1) Assuming that bûr’zâvand stands for bûrînênd which occurs in § 12.

[^1]: (111:1) ‘Having a good father,’ the Zvâri<i>s</i> of Av. Vanghu-fedhri, Yt. XIII, 142.

[^2]: (111:2) See Chap. I, 42.

[^3]: (111:3) See Chap. VIII, 55-57.

[^4]: (111:4) The Pahlavi interpretation of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh which is an imperfect transcript of the Av. Ukhshya<i>d</i>\-nemangh of Yt. XIII, 128.

[^5]: (111:5) Compare the summary in Dk. VIII, xiv, 13, as follows:—‘The arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, at the end of the second millennium; information _about_ him and his time, _and_ the destroyers _of_ the organizers who _were_ within the millennium _of_ Aûshê<i>d</i>ar.’

[^6]: (111:6) The MS. omits a clause here, which occurs in Chap. VIII, 58, possibly by mistake, as part of it is given In Chap. X, 19.
