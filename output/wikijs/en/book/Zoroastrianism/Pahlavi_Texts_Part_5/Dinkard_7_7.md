## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER VII.

1\. About the marvellousness which is manifested after _the time of_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp until the collapse (han<i>g</i>aftanŏ) _of_ the sovereignty of Iran.

2\. There is marvellousness _which_ is manifested after Vi<i>s</i>tâsp until the collapse of the sovereignty of Irân, apart from the blessedness of ordeal, the accomplishment of other Avestic rites, the great power over the sacred fires, _and_ many other religious observances _which_ were connected with the disciples of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

3\. Even after the devastation which happened owing to Alexander, those who _were_ rulers after him brought back much to the collection from a scattered state [^1]; _and_ there are _some_ who _have_ ordered the keeping _of it_ in the treasury of Shapân [^2].

4\. Likewise there is to be brought _forward_ what _there is_ concerning the names of rulers _and_ high-priests, _such_ as arrive for it at times _and_ periods, which _are_ each consecutive, as organizers _of_ the religion and the world; also of the tyrant _or_ apostate, who is manifest at various periods, for the disturbance of the religion _and_ monarchy and the penance of the world, _with_ the coming of the penitential _one_. <span id="p83"><sup><small>[ p. 83 ]</small></sup></span> 5\. _Such_ as Vohûmanô, son _of_ Spend-ad [^3], of the rulers, about whom it says even this in the Avesta, that _he is_ Vohûmanô, the just, who is the most efficient of the assembly of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers. 6. And <i>S</i>ênôv [^4] of the high-priests, as about him it says even this: ‘The religion becomes a hundred years _old_ when <i>S</i>ênôv is born, and two hundred years when he passes away; he was also the first Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper _with_ a life of a hundred _years_, _and_ who walks forth upon this earth with a hundred disciples.’

7\. Also Alexander of the devastators, as it says even this of him in revelation [^5], that _in_ those three winters, which _are_ of like purpose (ham-ay<i>â</i><i>z</i>akŏ), that Aeshm [^6] would set up a deadly king in the impenitent world, who is the evil-destined Alexander.

8\. And of the high-priests _are_ Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>vâk [^7], the interpretation of whose name is ‘the pure word;’ Srûtvôk-spâ<i>d</i>âk [^7], the interpretation of whose name is ‘the propitious recitation;’ Zrayang,h<i>a</i>u [^8], the interpretation of whose name is ‘the ocean existence’ and Spe<i>n</i>tô-khratv<i>a</i>u [^8], the interpretation of <span id="p84"><sup><small>[ p. 84 ]</small></sup></span> whose name is ‘the propitious wisdom.’ 9. Because it says even this about them, namely: ‘I mention thy manifestation, _and_ also the tokens of its publicity when this religion of thy Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers becomes four hundred years _old_ [^9]; in this law benightedness (lêlyâîh) arises, _and_ the embodied existences see the manifestation through calculation _of_ the planets and also the stars; and whoever, too, _are_ mine are _so_ for a century, through the average opinion _of_ thirty medium winters for a man [^10]; _and_ the righteous Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>vâk and those three others are they of the most righteous existences, over whom they _are_ the most masterly _and_ most authoritative in that time.’ to. And this, too, that they who glorify the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers in the fifth and sixth centuries are they; _and_ no persons save _their_ souls, except _those_ who remain for the arrival of the four [^11] interpretations that _arise_ through the authority of these four individuals, Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>vâk, Srûtô-spâdh<i>a</i>u [^12], Zrayang,h<i>a</i>u, _and_ Spe<i>n</i>tô-khratv<i>a</i>u who, all four of them, seek _their_ thoughts, words, _and_ deeds in the _sacred_ text (mânsar).

11\. Also Rashn-rêsh [^13] is the apostate of that <span id="p85"><sup><small>[ p. 85 ]</small></sup></span> time, as _some one_ [^14] says unto Rashn, _one_ of the sacred beings, and about many besides this _one_, thus: ‘All who are creatures of the beneficent spirit are distressed by their persecution, _but_ put trust in those men, Ar<i>e</i><i>z</i>vâk _and_ those three others.’

12\. And of the organizers of the period is Artakhshatar [^15], son of Pâpak, as it says even this about him, namely: ‘Which is that ruler who is powerful, more striving than the Kayâns, _and_ mighty, an embodiment of the _sacred_ commandments and awfully armed [^16]; in whose abode Aharî<i>s</i>vang [^17], the virtuous _and_ radiant, walks forth in maiden form, beneficent and very strong, well-formed, high-girded, and truthful, of illustrious race _and_ noble? 13. Whoever it is that, on the occurrence of strife, seeks prosperity for _him_self with his own arm; who-ever it is that, on the occurrence of strife, encounters the enemies with his own arm.’

14\. Tanvasar [^18] is also for his assistance, as it says <span id="p86"><sup><small>[ p. 86 ]</small></sup></span> this, too, about them: ‘Zaratû<i>s</i>t asked again thus: “Who is he who is the most salutary _for_ a country, which the demons _have_ exhausted of everything virtuous, over which his authority is brought and _which_ is wicked and teaching falsehood?” 15. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: "An autocrat (sâstâr), to cure a country, who _has_ not gone _mad_ (that is, he does not annoy the good) and is well-directing (that is, he gives virtuous commands), who is _also_ of noble race, and likewise a priest who is acquainted with war, of a famous province, _and_ righteous, are most salutary _for_ that country. 16. And I tell thee this, that the apostasy of destruction is _just_ like the four-legged wolf which the world gives up to running astray (var<i>d</i>ak-takhshi<i>s</i>nîh) (that is, owing to its action _they are_ leading _it_ off as astray; which is so that even he who is not opulent is rendered sickly, that they (_the apostates_) may take away his things by the hand of the assassin (khûnyân); and they shall lead the world, the dwelling for _his_ residence, into wandering. 17. But that wicked (<i>a</i><i>v</i>ârûnŏ) strife descended upon that country, besides that wicked demon-worship, besides that wicked slander; and not even that wicked strife, nor that wicked demon-worship, nor that wicked slander, is dissipated from <span id="p87"><sup><small>[ p. 87 ]</small></sup></span> that country until _the time_ when they attach the grant of approval to him, the spiritual leader, the eloquent (pûr-gûftâr), truthful-speaking, _and_ righteous Tanvasar. 18. And it is when they grant approval to the spiritual leader, the truthful speaker of eloquence, the righteous Tanvasar, that those _of_ the country obtain redress (bêsh<i>â</i><i>z</i>agânîh) when they seek _it_, and no deviation (anâyûînakŏîh) from the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t."’

19\. As to the nature of the questions _and_ statements of the organizer of the religion, Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> [^19] son of Mâ<i>r</i>aspend, about the connection of the glory with the race, it also says this, that ‘though righteousness _may_ arise from the statements and prosperity of the Tûrânians when extracted by questions, _it is_ said that its acceptance occurs there through complete mindfulness [^20]; they benefit the embodied world of righteousness, and produce distress for the fiend; in like manner, they rely upon Vohûmanô, _and_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t is their delight through the report of the birth _of_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t from us who are archangels. 20. This liberality for thee is _from_ us who are archangels, _and_ Âtûrpâ<i>d</i>, the very best well-destined _man_ arose; and this, too, do thou say about him, that it is the steel age in which that man, the organizer of development _and_ organizer of righteousness, Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> son of Mâ<i>r</i>aspend, of the convocation, begets Avarethrab<i>a</i>u [^21].’ <span id="p88"><sup><small>[ p. 88 ]</small></sup></span> 21\. This Avarethrab<i>a</i>u, too, is an organizer whose righteous guardian spirit we reverence, and _in_ memory of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, the well-destined, and a progenitor of Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> [^22], it says that ‘only from him _comes_ Avarethrab<i>a</i>u;’ and _then also arises_ this _one_ of the adversaries of the religion, the apostate of apostates, whom they have even called the Mazdag-like (Mazdagîg-i<i>k</i>) [^23]. 22. As it says this, too, about them, namely: ‘This religion of mine thou dost survey with thoughts of spiritual life, thou dost very thoroughly inspect _it_, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! when many, aware of apostates, call the performance of righteousness and even the priesthood innocence, and few are frank and practising _it_.’ 23. In the revelation of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers is this, namely: ‘Thoroughly look into revelation, and seek a remedy for them and any whatever of them who have become disturbing in the embodied existence, and uncaptivated _by_ the orthodox (âyîn-aûmônd) righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences; and so they divide the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers through division of race, they speak regarding the action _of_ their own _followers_, and give the endowment to their own. 24. They grant supplies of food, so that they _may_ say the food is proportional to the hunger; they speak of procreation, _and_ say that they say lineage is through the mothers; and they approve of wolfishness, so that they would act something like <span id="p89"><sup><small>[ p. 89 ]</small></sup></span> wolves _in_ the performance of gratifying their desires, like that of the wolf's progeny behind the mother. 25. Moreover, they form their lineage through the mothers; buying their women _as_ sheep, they shall carry off for profit even that son _or_ brother who is the progeny, those that we have produced for your companionship; you are not predominant, but _have_ remained in companionship; you do not even believe them, _but_ you do not establish an ordeal, although _it is_ evident that you will be acquitted they lie even to _their_ children, so that the advance of the promise-breaker is through them, and even in their own persons [^24].’

26\. Here it speaks about the organization of the religion _by_ the glorified [^25] Khûsrôî, son of Kavâ<i>d</i>, thus: ‘Upon their lingering behind, a man is produced who is righteous, the Glorified _one_ [^25], an approver (khênî<i>d</i>âr) of speech who is wise, whom the convocation, on hearing the words that he utters, speaks _of_ as a high-priest; that is when he gives out penance (srôshîgîh), so that he may effect the punishment of sinners. 27. The constant out-pouring of perplexity (pê<i>k</i> shârî<i>d</i>an) _by_ the perverters is the fear of that hero, as regards that <span id="p90"><sup><small>[ p. 90 ]</small></sup></span> convocation, when he casts _them forth_ by expulsion from the vicinity, so that he may make _them_ extinguished very quickly; owing to that, they, _whose_ producer is even he who is a person destroying the righteous man, become gloomy on account of the Glorified _one_, through _his_ smiting the spiritual life of apostasy; _just_ as now, when he who is gloomy, _and_ of scattered intellect, is gloomy owing to you _of_ the Spîtâmas.’ 28. This, too, it states, namely: ‘In every way, I tell thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! that their time is mistrustful (av<i>â</i><i>v</i>ar) as to him who is an open friend, _and_ most deceitful both _to_ the wicked and the righteous; the Glorified _one_ is a controller (ayûkhtâr) exalting the creatures, _and_ whoever is possessing the creatures of the righteous _ones_ [^26], so that he remains again at work in the doings of the Glorified _one_, is _he_ who is a combiner _of_ the actions _and_ an utterer of the true replies _of_ that Glorified _one_.’

29, And about the occurrence of a symptom of the devastators of the sovereignty _and_ religion of the country of Irân one wonder, which is associated with the religion, is even this _which_ it mentions thus: ‘Thereupon, when the first symptom of a ravager _of_ the country occurs, <i>O</i> righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t! then the more aggressive and more unmerciful _in_ malice becomes the tyrant of the country, and through him, too, they ravage (rêshênd) the house, through him the village, through him the community, through him the province, _and_ through him even the whole _of_ that manifestation _in_ the country _of_ any teaching whatever that occurs _through_ the ravager _of_ the country; and so the country should <span id="p91"><sup><small>[ p. 91 ]</small></sup></span> keep a man who is observant _and_ learned on the watch, because information is in his mind. 30. _Thereupon, when the second symptom of a ravager of the country occurs, &c._ [^27] . . . . . . . . . . 31. Thereupon, when the third symptom _of_ a ravager _of_ the country occurs, the priestly people are disturbing the tradition, so that they speak nothing wisely; it is even on this account they do not accept them, and it is not when _one_ speaks truly _that_ the ravager _of_ the country believes them, and through him, too, they ravage the house, through him the village, _through him the community_, through him the province, and through him even the whole _of_ that manifestation _in_ the country _of_ any teaching whatever _that_ occurs _through_ the ravager _of_ the country; and so, too, the country should keep a man who is observant _and_ learned on the watch, because information is in his mind. 32. Thereupon, when the fourth symptom _of_ a ravager of the country occurs, it upsets the replenishment of the fires, and upsets those men of the righteous, so that they shall not undertake the care of them; and thus they shall not convey the holy-water to him who is a priestly authority, so that they may not produce the seizing upon the stipend _of_ the priestly authorities _by_ him who is the ravager _of_ the country; through him, too, they ravage the house, through him the village, through him the community, through him _the province, and through him_ even the whole _of_ that <span id="p92"><sup><small>[ p. 92 ]</small></sup></span> manifestation _in_ the country _of_ any teaching whatever _that_ occurs _through_ the ravager _of_ the country; _and_ so, too, the country should keep a man who is observant _and_ learned on the watch, because information is in his mind.’

33\. About the collapse of the sovereignty of Irân, it also states this, namely: ‘That very villain (mar), <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! brings those provinces on to running astray, so that he may make-those quite dissevered which constitute the existence of that powerful sovereignty; and then he is a thorough assailant of the righteous, then he is an assailant _of_ the righteous with eagerness. 34. That same deadly _one_ (mar), <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! does not continue living long afterwards; moreover his offspring disappear (that is, they perish utterly); but his soul falls to the bottom of the gloomy existence which is horrible hell, and upon their bodies every kind _of_ unseemly unhappiness comes from themselves, owing to their own actions when they give approval to the imprisonment of a guardian of spiritual _affairs_ who is eloquent, true-speaking, _and_ righteous. 35. Against that deadly _one_ he contends, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! for the spiritual lordship _and_ priestly authority that I approve _as_ good _for_ the whole embodied existence; also against the preparation of a decree to produce evil decisions, _and_ against the dismissal of litigants, whether heterodox or orthodox, who are of a family of serfs of a far-situated village and are making petitions.’

36\. ‘And _as to_ the land, too, over which he wanders, the evil spirit utterly devastates their country through pestilence and other misery; and, moreover, strife which is tormenting falls upon that <span id="p93"><sup><small>[ p. 93 ]</small></sup></span> country, besides demon-worship which is iniquitous, _and_ besides slander which is iniquitous. 37. And the strife which is iniquitous is not to be dissipated (<i>a</i>pâsî-aîtanŏ) from that country, nor the demon-worshippers who _are_ iniquitous, nor the slander which is iniquitous, before the _time_ when they give approval to him, to the priest who is a guardian of spiritual _affairs_, who is eloquent, true-speaking, and righteous; and it is when they give him approval, that they obtain healthfulness _for_ their country when they pray _for it_, and not irregularly from him, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! ’

38\. And this which is recounted is a statement that is execrated (nafrîg-aîtŏ) by many, details from the Avesta as to occurrences _that will_ arise after Vi<i>s</i>tâsp until the dispersion (ang<i>â</i><i>v</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) of the sovereignty of Irân from the country of Irân; _it is also_ declared that this which is written happened _to_ the knowledge of those of the world. 39. This, too, is about the evidence of the above:—‘And if this which is declared from the Avesta, as to _what_ happens after Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp until the end of the sovereignty of Irân, should not have happened, and _it being_ the pre-eminence of the Avesta which really became this present treasure, it thereby ensues, owing to its position in that _former_ [^28], and the manifest absence of the destruction of those rulers _and_ high-priests from Vi<i>s</i>tâsp onwards in this _latter_ [^29], that it could not be connected with us [^30].’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (82:1) Referring to king Valkha<i>s</i> the A<i>s</i>kânian (probably Vologeses I, see S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, p. 413); possibly also to Ardashîr Pâpakân.

[^2]: (82:2) So here, but usually written Shapîgân, and sometimes Shaspîgân. It was no doubt a royal treasury, and Dk. V, iii, 4, calls it so, but uses the words gan<i>g</i>ŏ-î khû<i>d</i>âyân, in which <i>G</i>âmâsp is said to have deposited the Avesta and Zand written in gold upon ox-hides. If Shapîgân be a corruption of shâyagân, ‘royal,’ it is singular that some copyist has not corrected the spelling.

[^3]: (83:1) Av. Spe<i>n</i>tô-dâta of Yt. XIII, 103, a son of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, with whom Avesta dynastic history ends. He was the Persian Isfendiyâr, and his son Vohûmanô is unknown to the Avesta. The <i>K</i>itradâ<i>d</i> Nask (Dk. VIII, xiii, 18) mentions a ‘Namûn, son of Spend-shê<i>d</i>,’ which probably stands for ‘Vohûmanô, son of Spend-dâ<i>d</i>.’ but this appears to have been in a Pahlavi supplement compiled in Sasanian times. He is also mentioned in Bd. XXXIV, 8, a chapter ‘about the computation of years by the Arabs,’ according to the Irânian Bundahi<i>s</i>.

[^4]: (83:2) Av. Saêna of Yt. XIII, 97, where the last clause of the passage here translated from the Avesta occurs. Compare Zs. XXIII, 11.

[^5]: (83:3) Not in the extant Avesta.

[^6]: (83:4) The demon of Wrath.

[^7]: (83:5) Av. gen. Erezv<i>a</i>u and Srûtô-spâd<i>a</i>u in Yt. XIII, 115.

[^8]: (83:6) These two names are written in their Av. gen. forms, as they occur in Yt. XIII, 115.

[^9]: (84:1) If the chronology in Bd. XXXIV, 7, 8 were correct, the interval between the first revelation of the religion and the death of Alexander would be 272 years, and this would make the 400th year of the religion coincide with B.C. 195.

[^10]: (84:2) That is, for a generation. The meaning appears to be, that these four successive high-priests insure the continuance of orthodox religion for more than a century, or well into the sixth century of the religion, as mentioned in § 10.

[^11]: (84:3) The MS. has the cipher for ‘three,’ by mistake.

[^12]: (84:4) Here written in Avesta characters.

[^13]: (84:5) In Dk. III, cxcviii, 2, this apostate is said to have been an p. 85 associate (ham-p<i>â</i><i>î</i>gar) of the Christian ecclesiastic Akvân, and yells out ten admonitions contradicting those of the righteous <i>S</i>ênôv who is mentioned in § 6 (see Peshotan's edition, vol. v, pp. 239, 311). It does not follow that he was a contemporary of <i>S</i>ênôv, and here he seems to be placed fully two centuries later.

[^14]: (85:1) Probably Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.

[^15]: (85:2) The founder of the Sâsânian dynasty, who reigned as king of the kings of Persia, A<i>D</i>. 226-241.

[^16]: (85:3) Most of these qualities are applied to the angel Srôsh, the personification of obedience (see Yas. LVII, 1); also to Kavi Vi<i>s</i>tâspa and Karsna, son of Zbaurva<i>n</i>t, in Yt. XIII, 99, 106.

[^17]: (85:4) Av. Ashi<i>s</i> vanguhi, ‘good rectitude,’ personified as a female angel; her description is given in Yt. XIII, 107, and is similar to that of Anâhita in Yt. V, 64.

[^18]: (85:5) So spelt here and in §§ 17, 18, thrice in all; it is also thrice spelt Tansar, in Dk. III, last chapter, 7; IV, 25, 25, and this mis-spelling has led to the mis-pronunciation Tôsar. It appears, however, that Tanvasar is a transposition of Tanvars, ‘hairy-bodied,’ p. 86 because we are told that Tansar, or Tanvasar, was so called on account of all his limbs being covered with hair (vars). his statement occurs in the introduction to Tanvasar's letter to Gushnaspshâh (Ar. <i>G</i>asnasf-shâh), king of Pa<i>d</i>ashkhvârgar (Ar. Farshvâdgar) and Tabaristân; and is made on the authority of an old Pahlavi copyist, Bahrâm Khûrzâd, whose Pahlavi was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa in the middle of the eighth century, and that into Persian early in the thirteenth century (see Darmesteter's edition in Journal Asiatique for 1894, pp. 185-250, 502-555).

[^19]: (87:1) A high-priest who was prime minister of king Shahpûhar II (A<i>D</i>. 309-379). He is often mentioned in Pahlavi writings, but in the Avesta he is only alluded to, apparently, by the title Râ<i>s</i>tare-vaghe<i>n</i>t in Yt. XIII, 106.

[^20]: (87:2) A translation of Av. spe<i>n</i>ta-ârmaiti, the archangel Spendâ<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>.

[^21]: (87:3) So written, all three times in Pâzand. He is the Avarethra-bangh, p. 88 son of Râ<i>s</i>tare-vaghe<i>n</i>t of Yt. XIII, 106, better known as Zaratû<i>s</i>t, son of Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> in his old age, for whom the Andar’z-î Âtûrpâ<i>d</i>\-î Mâ<i>r</i>aspendân was written.

[^22]: (88:1) Whose pedigree is traced back to Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar in Bd. XXXIII, 3.

[^23]: (88:2) Probably some disciple of Mânih, the heretic who had been put to death A<i>D</i>. 276-7. Mazdag was put to death A<i>D</i>. 528. See S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 257 n, 278 n.

[^24]: (89:1) This quotation, from a Pahlavi version of an Avesta text, would probably be very applicable to the state of the Persian people at many periods in the fourth and fifth centuries, when heresy was prevalent and orthodox Zoroastrianism was by no means universal. Some of the evils mentioned are inseparable from slavery at all times.

[^25]: (89:2) Literally ‘immortal-soulled,’ Anôshak-rûbân, the usual title of king Khusrô I, who reigned A. D. 531-578. Before he became king, A. D. 528 or 529, he had summoned an assembly of priests to condemn the heretic Mazdag, when the last important revision of the Pahlavi versions of the Avesta probably took place (see Byt. I, 6-8, and Nöldeke's Gesch. der Sas. pp. 463-466).

[^26]: (90:1) Of the good spirits.

[^27]: (91:1) The whole of this section is omitted in the old MS., evidently by mistake. Perhaps the second symptom of devastation was connected with the evil deeds of the warrior class, but this is very uncertain. Passages of four or five words are also omitted by the MS. in §§ 31, 32.

[^28]: (93:1) The above declaration from the Avesta.

[^29]: (93:2) The present Avesta itself.

[^30]: (93:3) Meaning perhaps that, for some good reason, it could not be communicated to us in the extant Avesta. If § 39 be not a later addition to this chapter, it implies that the prophetical quotations from the Avesta, regarding the history of the religion after the time p. 94 of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, were no more extant in the Avesta, when the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> was compiled, than they are now.
