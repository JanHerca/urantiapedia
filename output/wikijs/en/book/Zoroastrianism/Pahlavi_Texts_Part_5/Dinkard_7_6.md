## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER VI.

1\. About the marvellousness which is manifested after the departure (vîkhê<i>z</i>ŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, whose guardian spirit is reverenced, to the best existence, _and_ in the life_time_ of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.

2\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared by revelation, about the provision of a chariot [^3] by Srîtô [^4] of the Vîsraps [^5]; this is through a famous wonder and <span id="p78"><sup><small>[ p. 78 ]</small></sup></span> the coming of a report about the marvellousness of that chariot to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, Vi<i>s</i>tâsp's begging that chariot from Srîtô, and Srîtô _saying_ in reply to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp: 'That chariot is for a righteous man, _in_ which the soul of Srîtô in the life_time_ of Srîtô‘s body [^1], _and_ that of that man in the life_time_ of his body, come visibly together once in the worldly existence.’ 3. And the soul of Sritô, through the generosity of that Srîtô, presents that chariot to the eyesight of that man of righteousness; thereby it becomes evident he had seen _it_, and is told not to act in another manner. 4. The exalted Kaî-Vî<i>s</i>tâsp, as becoming from revelation more particularly aware of this marvel about the future at that time, and for the sake of this marvel being published to the worldly existence (gêhânîgîh), and of _his_ becoming <span id="p79"><sup><small>[ p. 79 ]</small></sup></span> more invoking _for_ the supremacy of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, became discernible by those of the realm, is sought for, _and_ is most attended.

5\. A great wonder became manifest to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and those of the world, just as revelation mentions thus: ‘Thereupon the archangels are letting forth the soul of that _Srîtô_ from the light of the supreme heaven, from the light on to the earth created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; _and_ the soul of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp proceeded from him into the light to meet _it_. 6. Vi<i>s</i>tâsp proceeded on to the propitious south (rapîtvînŏ); he _was_ producing more gain than the gainers, and he was more inquisitive than the inquisitive; to all whom he saw he spoke, and unto such as spoke he listened; when he gazed at them looking simultaneously they stood up, _and_ obeisance _was_ offered by them unto the soul _and_ person of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.’

7\. Immediately upon that no delay occurred until _there_ came on at a run—_besides_ the soul of Sritô of the Vîsraps—the most horrid (agrandtûm) of demons, from the horrid northern quarter of the horrid destroyer (za<i>d</i>âr), that was himself black, and his deeds, too, were very black. 8. And as he comes himself, so also he grumbles to the soul of Srîtô thus: ‘Give a maintenance (khvârag) _to_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp who is thy driver [^1], for the sake of good fellowship and service, and for that, righteousness is suitable unto a pure _one_; do not _give it_ as a thing which is protective (that is, do not _give it_ for the sake of worldly gratuity), _but_ for love of the righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences.’

9\. When those words were fully heard by Srîtô of <span id="p80"><sup><small>[ p. 80 ]</small></sup></span> the Vîsraps, the early bestower (levînŏ-vakhsh), he stood still and so he spoke in words thus: ‘For righteousness I give thee, O mighty Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp this chariot which is without a driver, only for love of the righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences.’ 10. As much for righteousness as is best for righteousness, and as much for the soul as is best for the soul, the gift of the whole _was_ secured (that is, its acceptance _was_ announced as often as three times).

11\. Then that chariot became two chariots, one spiritual and the other worldly; in the worldly _one_ the exalted Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp travelled forth unto the village of the Nô<i>d</i>ars [^1] in the joyfulness _of_ good thoughts, and in the spiritual _one_ the soul of Srîtô of the Vîsraps travelled forth unto the best existence.

12\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared that in fifty-seven years onwards from the acceptance of the religion _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^2], the arrival of the religion is published in the seven regions [^3]; _and_ within the life_time_ of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, the circumstance (aê<i>d</i>ûnŏîh) is manifested by the coming of _some_ from _other_ regions to Frashô<i>s</i>tar of the Hvôbas [^4] for enquiry _about_ the <span id="p81"><sup><small>[ p. 81 ]</small></sup></span> religion, _even_ as revelation mentions thus: ‘Two whose names are thus, Spîtôî<i>s</i> [^1] and Arezrâspô [^2], who have hastened unto Frashô<i>s</i>tar of the Hvôbas in search of wisdom.’

13\. Thus much splendour and wonder of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp _and_ those of the realm regarding Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^3], and thus much due to the coming of the archangels from the sky to the earth before Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, as evidence about the true prophesying of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^4]; and that, too, about Pêshyôtan [^5], the chariot of Srîtô [^6], and other subjects seen written above, _are_ declared by the Avesta, which is the same that they accepted from Zaratû<i>s</i>t, as the culmination [^7] (<i>a</i><i>v</i>arîgânîh) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s words. 14. And if this splendour, glory, _and_ wonder that _are_ written above as regards _what_ those learned _men_ of the realm saw—which _are_ in the statement revealed by the Avesta—_had_ not occurred, king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and those learned _men_ of the realm would not have seen what this Avesta had revealed to them—which _was_ thus much splendour and wonder reported by it to them—_and_ not one word about leaving _its_ preservation to us would be annexed.

## Footnotes

[^3]: (77:3) Pahl. r<i>â</i><i>ê</i> which is written exactly like the Pahlavi ciphers for twenty-two and, no doubt, stands for Av. ratha.

[^4]: (77:4) So spelt ten times in §§ 2-11, but here Srâtô. It is also Srîtô in Dk. V, iii, 2.

[^5]: (77:5) Pahl. Vîsrapân in §§ 9, 11 and Dk. V, iii, 2; but here it is p. 78 Visrapân, and in § 7 the first letter is omitted, leaving only îsrapân. In Pahl. Vd. XX, 11 (Sp.) we have Srît-î ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_5/001.jpg) (in L4), which latter name may also be îsrapânŏ, though more likely to be read Sêr<i>z</i>ânŏ when considered by itself. It is almost certain that the person mentioned in Pahl. Vd. XX, 11 is intended to be the same as that named here in the text. But it is doubtful if this person be the Av. Thrita son of Sâyu<i>z</i>dri (or Sâi<i>z</i>dri) of Yt. V, 72; XIII, 113. As the legend in the text appears to refer to the soul of Srîtô, or Thrita, revisiting the world to meet Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, this Srîtô may have been the warrior Srîtô, the seventh brother, employed by Kaî-Ûs, about 350 years earlier, to kill the frontier-settling ox of that time, but there seem to be no means of so identifying him with absolute certainty.

[^1]: (78:1) This is the literal meaning of the Pahl. ‘mûn rûbân-î Srîtô pavan zîndagîh-î Srîtô tanŏ,’ but it is not quite consistent with Srîtô's return to the earth as a spirit. The Indian copyists seem to have observed this, as they have omitted several words, so as to alter the meaning to the following:—'That chariot is for a man of the righteous, _with_ whom Srîtô in the life_time_ of that _man's_ body comes visibly together, &c.' But the sentence is not quite grammatical.

[^1]: (79:1) This speech seems intended as veiled irony.

[^1]: (80:1) Nô<i>d</i>ar (Av. Naotara) was a son of king Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (Bd. XXXI, 13) and an ancestor of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp. Vi<i>s</i>tâsp being a descendant of Kaî-Kavâ<i>d</i>(Bd. XXXI, 28, 29) who was the adopted son of Aûzôbô (Bd. XXXI, 24) a son of Zâgh, son of Ma<i>s</i>vâk, son of Nô<i>d</i>ar (Bd. XXXI, 23 corrected from XXXIII, 5). Hûtôs, the wife of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, was also of the village of the Nô<i>d</i>ars (Yt. XV, 35).

[^2]: (80:2) That is fifty-seven years after the conference of Zaratû<i>s</i>t (see Chap. V, 1).

[^3]: (80:3) See the summary in Dk. VIII, xiv, 10:—'Likewise, about the communication of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's knowledge of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion to the world, his attracting mankind to the religion, _and_ the ages, after Zaratû<i>s</i>t, until the renovation _of the universe_.'

[^4]: (80:4) Av. Ferashao<i>s</i>trô Hvôgvô (Yas. LI, 17); he was a brother p. 81of <i>G</i>âmâsp (Dk. V, ii, 12; iii, 4; Zs. XXIII, 10), and the father of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's wife Hvôvi. The Hvôvas (Pahl. Hvôbas) were a numerous family.

[^1]: (81:1) Av. gen. Spitôi<i>s</i> (Yt. XIII, 121). He was high-priest of Frada<i>d</i>afsh, the south-east region.

[^2]: (81:2) Av. Erezrâspa (ibid.) He was high-priest of Vîda<i>d</i>afsh, the south-west region (see Bd. XXIX, I). These foreign envoys were brothers, each being a son of Uspãsnu.

[^3]: (81:3) See Chap. IV, 73.

[^4]: (81:4) See Chap. IV, 70-82.

[^5]: (81:5) See Chap. V, 12.

[^6]: (81:6) See §§ 2-11.

[^7]: (81:7) See Chap. V, 11.
