## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER II.

1\. About the marvellousness of the manifestations before [^1] the birth of that most auspicious of offsprings from _his_ mother [^2].

2\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that the creator passed on that glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through the material existences of the creatures [^3] to Zaratû<i>s</i>t; when the command arose from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the coming of that glory from the spiritual _existence_ to the worldly, and _to_ the material substance (mâ<i>d</i>îyâtŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, is manifested _as_ a great wonder to the multitude (va<i>l</i> kabedânŏ). 3. _Just_ as revelation mentions _it_ thus: ‘Thereupon, when Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> had produced the material (dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the glory then, in the <span id="p18"><sup><small>[ p. 18 ]</small></sup></span> presence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, fled on _towards_ the material of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, on to that germ; from that germ it fled on, on _to the light which is endless_ [^4]; from the light which is endless [^5] it fled on, on to that of the sun; from that of the sun it fled on, on _to_ the moon; from that moon it fled on, on to those stars; from those stars it fled on, on to the fire which _was_ in the house of Zôî<i>s</i> [^6]; _and_ from that fire it fled on, on to the wife of Frâhîmrva<i>n</i>ã-zôi<i>s</i> [^7], when she brought forth that girl who became the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.’

4\. Of that splendour, escaped at the same time into the earth _and_ into the sky, the father-in-law's ignorance is declared, so that it is said by those in the village of the more instructed and invoking Zôî<i>s</i> [^8], as to the self-combustion _which_ burns the fire, that fuel is not necessary for its use. 5. Then they went on to the governor (kê<i>d</i>ŏ), and he explained _to_ them concerning that same (that is, he spoke to them) thus: ‘The full glory of embodied existence <span id="p19"><sup><small>[ p. 19 ]</small></sup></span> is the glory of life _apart_ from the body, so that all diligence devoid of this is only movement.’

6\. And _it is_ declared that the demons, on account of their defeat by that glory in maintaining [^9] adversity for the girl, _were_ bringing on to that district three armaments (hênô), winter, the demon of pestilence, and oppressive enemies; and _a suspicion was_ cast by them into the minds of those of the district, that this harm happened to the district owing to the witchcraft of this girl; so that those of the district quarreled dreadfully with the parents, as to the witchcraft of antagonism _in_ the girl, and about putting _her_ out from that district.

7\. And the father of that girl spoke even these _words_ to those of the district, with much reason, about the unjust assertion of witchcraft relative to the girl, that is: ‘When this girl _was_ brought forth among those of mine, her whole destiny (vakhsh) was afterwards set forth _by_ that manifest radiance of fire, where it brought out radiance from all over her in the dark night. 8. When this girl sits in the interior of the house, wherein there is no fire, _and_ in the chamber (sarâî) of fire they increase _its_ intensity (bûr<i>z</i>ŏ), it is lighter there, where _and_ when this girl sits, than there where they increase the intensity of the fire; _one_ is dazzled by the radiance from her body, _and_ that of a wizard _would_ not _have_ been so glorious.’

9\. Even then, owing to the influence (sârîni<i>s</i>nŏ) of the demons, and the Kavîg and Karap [^10] of the <span id="p20"><sup><small>[ p. 20 ]</small></sup></span> district, they did not become satisfied; _so_ the father ordered the girl to go to Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô [^11], the father of a family in the country (matâ) of the Spîtâmas, in the district (rû<i>d</i>astâk) of Alâk; and the girl obeyed the command of _her_ father. 10. That disturbance which the demons caused, with evil intention, for the expatriation of that girl, the sacred beings assiduously made the reason for the coming of the girl for marriage to Pôrûshâspô, the father of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through _her_ father sending the girl to the dwelling of Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô, the father of Pôrûshâspô.

11\. One _marvel_ [^12] is this which is declared, that when that girl, in going to that family, stood on the loftiest place in the country of the Spîtâmas, and _it_ is surveyed by her, a great wonder is manifested to the girl, _just_ as revelation mentions: ‘It is their [^13] <span id="p21"><sup><small>[ p. 21 ]</small></sup></span> voice is carried away to her from them; “do thou proceed to that village which is theirs; it is very depressed in height and very wide in breadth, in which he who is living and the cattle mostly walk together; besides, for thy assistance that village is divinely fashioned _and_ compassionate.”’ 12. Thereupon that damsel stopped, and also fully observed that _their_ recital seems _to be_ for the conveyance of this statement, that my action _should be_ such as _was_ ordered me _by_ my father also. 13. Then that damsel thoroughly washed _her_ hands, and proceeded from them to that village which was Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô's, and the glory came to Pôrûshâspô, the son of Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô.

14\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> passed on the guardian spirit (fravâhar) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, to the parents of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through (le-<i>k</i>adôn) Hôm [^14], by a marvel produced by cultivation. 15. Again, too, revelation says that, when the separation (burînŏ) of the third millennium occurred, at the end of the 3,000 years of spiritual existence without a destroyer, (after the creatures _were_ in spiritual existence, _and_ before the arrival of the fiend); then the archangels framed Zaratû<i>s</i>t together, _and_ they seated the guardian spirit within, having a mouth, having a tongue, and the proclaimer _of_ the celestial mansions. <span id="p22"><sup><small>[ p. 22 ]</small></sup></span> 16\. Then the three millenniums of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^15] _were_ the number manifest to them through observation by the eye, _and_ it seemed that he became just like an archangel through bodily contact with (hamkerpîh) [^16] the archangels. 17. And when the separation of the third millennium occurred, after the framing of Zaratû<i>s</i>t together, and before the conveying of Zaratû<i>s</i>t down to the worldly _state_, at the end of the 3,000 years _of_ worldly existence with a destroyer, then Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> argued with Vohûmanô _and_ Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô [^17] thus: ‘Is his mother beheld by you, so that we may produce Zaratû<i>s</i>t?’

18\. And Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô spoke _in_ reply thus: ‘Thou art aware even of that, O propitious _one!_ about the Zaratû<i>s</i>t we _shall_ produce, _and_ thou and we have produced, thou knowest, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! _and to us_ who are the other archangels do thou announce the place, because its appearance thou knowest, _thou_ propitious spirit Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>!’

19\. Then Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> argued with Vohûmanô and the reminding by A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô [^18], Shatraver, Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i>, _and_ Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^19], _saying:_ <span id="p23"><sup><small>[ p. 23 ]</small></sup></span> ‘The conveying of Zaratû<i>s</i>t down does not seem _to be for_ me, because, having a mouth _and_ having a tongue, _he will be_ a proclaimer to the world of embodied beings. 20. If we convey Zaratû<i>s</i>t down on to the world of embodied beings, having a mouth _and_ having a tongue, _as_ a proclaimer _of_ the celestial mansion, this is evident: they _will_ say, concerning the origin _of_ him who is my righteous man, _that_ we frame him together with the water, with the land, with the plants, _and_ with the animals [^20]. 21. Therefore we _will_ carry off there, to the village of Pôrûshâspô, him whom they _will_ call Zaratû<i>s</i>t of good lineage of both natures, both _of_ Nêryôsang [^21] who is of the archangels, and _of_ Yim who is of mankind.’

22\. Then the archangels framed together a stem of Hôm the height of a man, excellent in colour, _and_ juicy where fresh; also to carry off the guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t to that stem of theirs, the archangels made it go forth thither from that endless light, and gave it up there also to the instinctive intellect (âsnô vîr). 23. Likewise their carrying off _was_ manifest around, and a wall _was_ openly displayed round them, but a restless one; the Hôm _was_ constantly provided with a mouth, where it was suitable, _and_ sap constantly oozed from the Hôm where it was moist.

24\. And when thirty [^22] years of the 3,000 years of <span id="p24"><sup><small>[ p. 24 ]</small></sup></span> well-disturbed [^23] worldly existence remained, Vohûmanô and Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô then associated their pre-eminence together, _and_ turned off into the embodied existence; there they came up to where two birds had settled in quest of progeny, _and_ seven years before the serpents devoured the inexperienced progeny. 25. For their _own_ designs, Vohûmanô _and_ Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô went on, and those birds consulted _them_ thus: ‘We have to offer homage, and our want is that Hôm.’

26\. The circumstances of those associated together in pre-eminence and the request of these _for_ that Hôm _were_ a double marvel; Vohûmanô seized one of those _birds_ by both legs, and the other _by_ one; he also brought them that Hôm, and gave it up to them there, on that tree within _their_ nest. 27. And they uncovered above the serpents, that have gone up to the progeny of the birds; then that guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t started up, and the serpents on the tree rushed also from them away towards the demons; _but_ that guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t smote them on the jaws, _and_ the serpents fell down _and_ expired, which _events_ have also occurred among them till now, _having_ been requisite as regards a depriver of life (<i>g</i>ân-gîr) and _any_ one of that species. 28. And that Hôm _was_ connected with that tree; and on the summit of that tree, there <span id="p25"><sup><small>[ p. 25 ]</small></sup></span> where the nest of the birds was, it grew constantly fresh and golden-coloured [^24].

29\. After the coming of her who bore Zaratû<i>s</i>t, to Pôrûshâspô for marriage, Vohûmanô _and_ A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô, thus associated together in their pre-eminence, came up there to Pôrûshâspô in the cattle-pasture of the Spîtâmas, and their thoughts _were_ confined to that Hôm brought by them. 30. Then Pôrûshâspô walked forth, with spiritual desire, up to the water of the Dâît [^25], because the requirement of the spirits is the spiritual knowledge [^26] that spirits are ever-beneficial; and that Hôm _was_ also seen by him, when it had grown on that tree, on the inside of the nest. 31. Then Pôrûshâspô thought thus: ‘It is for me, really (madam-<i>î</i><i>k</i>\-am) to proceed and, even as _there_ is no reaching by me up to that Hôm, that tree must be cut down, for apart from that, <i>O</i> Hôm of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! thou seemest fresh, so that the benefit of something from thee _will be_ advantageous.’

32\. Then Pôrûshâspô walked on and washed their clothes acquiescently (patâsîg), and here a great wonder was manifest to Pôrûshâspô. 33. About this it says that, all the while that Pôrûshâspô washed their clothes, Vohûmanô then proceeded from the uppermost third of the tree unto the middle of it, whereon _it was_ the desire of Pôrûshâspô <span id="p26"><sup><small>[ p. 26 ]</small></sup></span> to be conveyed. 34. Then Pôrûshâspô, _having_ washed the clothes, walked up to it and, thereupon gathering up the whole of that _Hôm_, all of it _was_ then also appropriated by him through assistance like that of that _archangel, just_ as what thou offerest for the food-sustenance of a friend's son of two years _or_ three years _of age;_ and it seemed to him that _archangel's_ joyful payment.

35\. Carrying off their Hôm, Pôrûshâspô spoke of it to _his_ noble (mas) wife thus: ‘So thou, <i>O</i> Dûk<i>d</i>âûb! shouldst keep their Hôm in custody, all the while that their Hôm fulfils duty and routine.’

36\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that the coming of the nature (gôhar) of the body of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through water _and_ vegetation, to the bodies of _his_ parents, is manifested _as_ a great wonder of the creator to the multitude. 37. As revelation mentions _it thus:_ ‘Thereupon, when Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> had produced the material (dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^27], the nature of _his_ body then, in the presence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, fled on _towards_ the material of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.’

38\. About Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> and Mû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^28] bringing the cloud-water down in a compassionate manner ever anew, drop by drop, _and_ completely warm, for the delight of sheep and men, _and—with_ as much seed as the roving of two rampant bulls _would_ thereby _cast_ upon the plants _which_ have grown, all of every species—_they are_ casting _it_ upon those other plants at that time, even upon the dry _ones_; and the <span id="p27"><sup><small>[ p. 27 ]</small></sup></span> nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t came from that water to those plants.

39\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that, in order that the nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t shall come unto _his_ parents, after [^29] the mounting of the archangels Pôrûshâspô drives six white cows, with yellow ears, up to those plants. 40. And here is manifested a great wonder, _such_ as revelation mentions thus: Two [^30] of those cows, unimpregnated, _had_ become full of milk, and the nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t came from the plants to those cows, and is mingled with the cows' milk; it is owing thereto _that_ Pôrûshâspô drove those cows back. 41. And Pôrûshâspô spoke to Dûk<i>d</i>âûb thus: ‘<i>O</i> Dûk<i>d</i>âûb! in two of those cows, _which are_ unimpregnated _and have_ not calved, milk _has_ appeared; do thou milk those cows, which are the splendour _and_ glory of the cows _and of_ any embodied existence whatever.’ 42. And Dûk<i>d</i>âûb arose and, taking that pail of hers which had a four-fold capacity, she also milked from them the milk which _was_ in them, and a great _part_ of what they gave up to her she had to throw away; and the nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t was in that milk.

43\. One _marvel_ is this which is manifested in the struggle of the adversary for concealing and spoiling that milk, _just_ as revelation mentions thus: Thereupon, at that time, the demons formed _themselves_ into an assembly, and the demon of demons growled thus: ‘You demons become quite unobservant: that food is really supplied fresh, so that the formation is settled which _will_ extend as far as to that <span id="p28"><sup><small>[ p. 28 ]</small></sup></span> man who _will be_ the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t; which of you _will_ undertake his destruction, all the while that he exists for mankind, so as to make _him_ more contemptibly impotent?’ 44. <i>K</i>êshmak [^31], astute in evil, growled thus: ‘I _will_ undertake his destruction.’ 45. Astute in evil, he rushed away with thrice fifty _of_ the demons who are Karaps of <i>K</i>êshmak; and that village _was_ partly uprooted and partly destroyed [^32] by him, fellow-workers _were_ ruined, and the number of fellow-eaters of broken victuals, attending the great, _was_ not broken up, among whom was he that had repelled his authority.

46\. _It is_ declared that, afterwards, Pôrûshâspô asked again _for_ that Hôm from Dûk<i>d</i>âûb, and he pounded it, and with that cows' milk [^33], into which the nature of the body of Zaratû<i>s</i>t had come, he here mingled the guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and the nature of the body came at once into union with it.

47\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that Pôrûshâspô _and_ Dûk<i>d</i>âûb drank up that Hôm and milk, when they were mingled together and announced to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and here occurred a combination of the glory, guardian spirit, and bodily nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t into a man_child_. 48. And a great wonder is manifested to both of them, through that which revelation mentions thus: Thereupon, both have embraced the first _time_ [^34] with desire <span id="p29"><sup><small>[ p. 29 ]</small></sup></span> for a son, _and_ the demons shouted out unto them, in the villainous speech _of_ sinfulness, thus: ‘Why shouldst thou act like this, vile [^35] Pôrûshâspô?’ whereupon they started up like people who _are_ ashamed. 49. A second _time_ they have embraced, and the demons shouted out unto them, in villainous speech; whereupon they started up like people who _are_ ashamed. 50. A third _time_ they have embraced thus, with desire for a son; and the demons shouted out unto them, in villainous speech; whereupon they started up like people who _are_ ashamed. 51. And they spoke with one another about _it, and_ continued at this duty, and accomplished it [^36], _saying_: ‘We will not so stop without accomplishing something, not _even_ though both Râk and Nô<i>d</i>ar _should_ arrive here together [^37].’ 52. Then that man_child_ who _was_ the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t became complete, and here _below there_ came together the nature of the body, the guardian spirit, and the glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in the womb _of his_ mother.

53\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that, after the combination of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in the womb _of his_ mother, the demons strove anew wonderfully <span id="p30"><sup><small>[ p. 30 ]</small></sup></span> to cause the death of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in _his_ mother's womb, and she who bore him _was_ rendered sickly by them through the sharpest of sharp and afflictive pain, until she wished to ask the wizard physicians for a desirable remedy. 54. And here is manifested a great wonder, just as revelation says: ‘It is then a voice of theirs is carried away there to her from the higher region, from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and from the archangels, thus: “Thou damsel who goest! do not proceed thither, because anything _of_ theirs is destruction through wizard medical treatment; _for_ healthfulness wash _thy_ hands thoroughly, _and_ those hands shall take firewood, and upon it thou shalt offer meat for the sake of the infant, thou shalt offer up cows’ butter _to_ the fire for his sake; thou shalt likewise heat _it_ at the fire for his sake, and shalt quaff (pâîmês) _it_ off at the _proper_ time for his sake, and thou _wilt_ become well.”’ 55. Then at once that damsel washed _her_ hands thoroughly, and she did just as _she had_ heard, and became well [^38].

56\. One _marvel_ is this which is manifested to the multitude when three days remained to his coming [^39] _forth_; in the manner of the sun, at the approach of _its_ uprising, when its first advancing twilight is diffused, _his_ body is then announced as revelation says: ‘It is then when in those last three nights during which Zaratû<i>s</i>t was in the womb, where he still subsisted three days till afterwards born, _that_ the village of Pôrûshâspô became all luminous. 57. Then spoke the horse-owners and cattle-owners of the Spîtâmas, in running away, thus: “It is requisite _to be_ forgiven [^40]; the village of Pôrûshâspô, on which <span id="p31"><sup><small>[ p. 31 ]</small></sup></span> that fire [^41] is in every crevice, is disturbed by confusion [^42].” 58. Then, on running together again, they said: “It is not fully forgiven for the village of Pôrûshâspô; fire is on it in every crevice _and_ it is disturbed by confusion; unto him is born, at his house, a brilliant man_child_.”’

59\. This, too, is one of the wonders, when the report of the marvellousness of the birth _of_ that man_child_ _and of his_ great glory, is due to statements of Yim and also others, brilliant in carrying on the destiny which had entered them from the sacred beings. 60. Wherein Yim spoke to the demons thus: ‘Here _below_ the pure _and_ righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t _will_ be born, who _will_ produce for you who are demons that absence of intercession which is prepared for you (that is, he _will_ produce for you a thoroughly-harassed actual inactivity, an absence of intercession so that you are not able to pray on your own account, _and_ no one prays for you).’

61\. _It is_ declared that the report about the birth of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and concerning his prophesying, is explained (avazandî-hastŏ) only by the illustrious, _such_ as Yim and Frê<i>d</i>ûn _and_ many learned people; but the sacred beings are also heard through the tongues of the animals scattered in the world, in order that even that witness shall arise as regards his prophesying. 62. _Just_ like that which is declared, that in the reign of Kaî-Ûs _there_ was an ox, and a splendour had come to his body from the sacred beings; and whenever a dispute as to the frontier arose between Irân and Tûrân, that ox _was_ brought, and the boundary between Irân and Tûrân <span id="p32"><sup><small>[ p. 32 ]</small></sup></span> _was_ truly shown by him. 63. And because, when an Irânian _had_ to seek a decision as to a Tûrânian in a dispute _and_ lies occurred, the Tûrânians were constantly convicted through the showing of the boundary _by_ the ox, and happened to be defeated by the Irânians—_and_, besides that, their envy also _arose_ as to Kaî-Ûs, even of _his_ ownership—therefore, on account of _his_ possession of that wonder, the Tûrânians proceeded about the smiting and destruction of that ox, and through their sorcery and witchcraft the mind of Kaî-Ûs _was_ disturbed about that ox, and he went to a warrior, _whose_ name _was_ Srîtô [^43], _and_ ordered him to kill that ox; _so_ that man came to smite the ox. 64. And here is manifested a wonder of importance by that ox, _such_ as revelation mentions thus: ‘To him spoke the ox, in grave words, thus: “Thou shouldst not murder me, <i>O</i> Sritô! thou seventh [^44] of those of this race; you _will_ atone _for this_ malice when Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the most desirous of righteousness among the existences, arrives and proclaims thy bad action in revelation; and the distress in thy soul becomes such as is declared by that passage where _it says:_ ‘As death occurs to him, that of Va<i>d</i>ak [^45] and the like occurs.’”’ 65. _It_ is declared that that man, when this wonder _was_ thus seen by him _proceeding_ from the ox, did not kill _it_, but went back to Kaî-Ûs _and_ told _him_ what he _had_ seen. 66. Kaî-Ûs then still, on account of the amazing deceitfulness of the demons and wizards, ordered the same man to smite that ox <span id="p33"><sup><small>[ p. 33 ]</small></sup></span> and that man proceeded also again to the ox, _and_ though _it was_ carrying _on_ still much _of_ that talk, he did not lend an ear to _it, but_ killed _it_.

67\. Regarding the sole-created ox [^46], too, _it_ is declared that, _on_ meeting its destruction by the evil spirit, it bellowed thus: ‘Though thou thinkest it as to us, <i>O</i> evil spirit, astute in evil! that thou art _in_ every way a winner by destruction, _it is_ not to our destruction thou art even then an attainer _in_ every way (that is, _it_ is not possible for thee so to annihilate that we _shall_ not arise again); even now I proclaim that that man, Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas, _will_ arrive in that last revolution, who _will_ produce distress for the demons, the assistants of the demon, and also the wicked who are bipeds.’

68\. Likewise the marvellousness of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's defeat of the demons, owing to his glory and by means of his sagacity, even before he had come into the world by birth; when Frâsîy<i>â</i><i>v</i>  [^47] the wizard is amazingly distressed through seeking that glory of his by desire of the demons, just as revelation [^48] mentions thus: ‘Thereupon Frâsîy<i>â</i><i>v</i>, the very powerful Tûrânian, rushed away, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! to the wide-formed ocean a first, a second, and a third time; and he wished to obtain that glory which is specially for those _of_ the countries of Irân, _for_ the born and the unborn, and which is _for_ the righteous _one; but_ he did not attain to that glory.’ <span id="p34"><sup><small>[ p. 34 ]</small></sup></span> 69. And this, too, _is mentioned_, that to all the seven regions the villain Frangrâsîyâk rushed away, and the glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _was_ sought by him [^49].

70\. Here is an enumeration _of_ the worthy lineage of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^50]:—Zaratû<i>s</i>t _was son_ of Pôrûshâspô, _son_ of Pa<i>d</i>îragtarâspô, of Urugadhasp\*, of Haê<i>k</i>a<i>d</i>aspô\*, of <i>K</i>ikhshnu<i>s</i>\*, of Paêtrasp\*, of Are<i>g</i>adhar<i>s</i>n\*, of Hardhar\*, of Spîtâm, of Vaêdi<i>s</i>t\*, of Nayâzem\* [^51], of Aîrî<i>k</i> 3, of Dûrâsrôbô, of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar monarch of Irân, of Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnar, of Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnâk whom Nêrôksang implanted in [^52] Vîzak\*, _daughter_ of Air-yak\*, _son_ of Thritak\*, of Bitak\*, of Frazû<i>s</i>ak\*, of Zû<i>s</i>ak\*, of Fragûzak\* [^53], of Gûzak\* [^54], _daughter_ of Aîrî<i>k</i>, _son_ of Frê<i>d</i>ûn monarch of Khvanîras, _son_ of Pûr-tô<i>r</i>â the Âspîgân, of Nêvak-tô<i>r</i>â the Âspîgân, of Sôg-tô<i>r</i>â the Âspîgân, of Bôr-tô<i>r</i>â the Âspîgân, of Ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>âr-tô<i>r</i>â [^55] the Âspîgân, of Sîyah-tô<i>r</i>â the Âspîgân, of Spêtô-tô<i>r</i>â the Âspîgân, of Gêfar-tô<i>r</i>â the Âspîgân, of Ramak-tô<i>r</i>â [^56] the Âspîgân, of Vanôfravi<i>s</i>n the Âspîgân, of Yim monarch of the seven <span id="p35"><sup><small>[ p. 35 ]</small></sup></span> regions, _son_ of Vîvangha, of Ayang,ha<i>d</i>\*, of Anang,ha<i>d</i>\*, _son_ of Hôshâng the Pê<i>s</i>dâ<i>d</i>ian monarch of the seven regions, _son_ of Fravâk, of Sîyâmak, of Masyâ, of Gâyômar<i>d</i> the first man.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (17:1) The MS. has pata<i>s</i> for pê<i>s</i>.

[^2]: (17:2) The contents of this chapter are thus mentioned in the summary of the Spend Nask (Dk. VIII, xiv, 1 in S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, p. 31):—‘The Spend _contains_ particulars about the origin _and_ combination of the material _existence_, guardian spirit, _and_ soul (or glory) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; how the creation of each one _occurred_ in the spiritual _existence_, and _in_ what mode _it was_ produced for the worldly _existence_; how their connection with the parents _arose_, the coming of the parents together, the combination in the mother, and the birth from the mother; _and_ whatever is on the same subject.’

[^3]: (17:3) The writer uses two Arabic words: ‘mâ<i>d</i>îyâtŏ-i ‘<i>h</i>alqŏ.’

[^4]: (18:1) Perplexed by the repetitions, some copyist has evidently omitted this phrase by mistake.

[^5]: (18:2) Pahl. anagar, a transcript of Av. anaghra which is always translated by Pahl. asar, ‘endless.’ The ‘endless light’ is the abode of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, see Bd. I, 2.

[^6]: (18:3) Written in Pâzand.

[^7]: (18:4) Also written in Pâzand. In Bd. XXXII, 10, it is stated that ‘the name of the father of the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t was Frahimravâ’ (or Fereâhimruvânâ in the Irânian version); but very little reliance can be placed on such Pâzand readings of names originally written in Pahlavi.

[^8]: (18:5) Here written in Pahlavi letters which can also be read Zandîh. In the text, the two preceding adjectives, farhakhtar va-khvân, might be read Farâkht-ruvânân as the beginning of the name. But, as it stands, the text implies that Zôî<i>s</i>, the father-in-law of his son Frâhim-rva<i>n</i>ã's wife, was the master of the house, which is the usual oriental arrangement.

[^9]: (19:1) Reading dârîh, but it may be gârîh for kârîh, ‘producing.’

[^10]: (19:2) The Karaps were apparently idolatrous priests, especially those before the conversion of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp by Zaratû<i>s</i>t; one being called ‘a wizard’ in Chap. III, 5, 42-44, another ‘unsanctified’ in IV, 24, p. 20 a third is ‘deadly’ in IV, 67, and a demon himself is a Karap in IV, 61, and has Karaps under his control in II, 45. The following Karaps are named in the time of Zaratû<i>s</i>t:—Dûrâsrôbô mentioned in Chap. III, 4-41; Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh in III, 20-34, who is called a Tûrânian in III, 28; Vaêdvôi<i>s</i>t in IV, 21-24; and Zâk in IV, 67. Some others are named by other writers. The Kavîgs, Kaîs, or Kîgs are mentioned with the Karaps in Chaps. II, 9; III, 50; IV, 2, 6, 14, 64, 67; VIII, 26, 40, as equally objectionable, but their avocation as officials is not defined. Both classes seem to have held official rank, but whether their titles were tribal or official is uncertain. The Avesta calls them Karapan and Kavi; the latter word being also the royal title of the Kayân dynasty, of which Vi<i>s</i>tâsp was a member. Compare Zs. XV, 1-4; XXIII, 8.

[^11]: (20:1) So also in §§ 13, 70. In Bd. XXXII, 1, 2, the two old MSS. of the Irânian Bundahi<i>s</i> have Padtarâsp thrice and Pîrtarâsp once; K 20 has Spîtarsp and Paitiresp; K 20 b has Padirtarâspô and Paitirispô; and M6 has Padirtarâsp and Paitiresp. Zs. XIII, 6, has Purtarâspô.

[^12]: (20:2) One of the marvellous manifestations mentioned in § 1.

[^13]: (20:3) Probably we should read: ‘It is the voice of those sacred beings’ who are mentioned in § 10. As the word ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân, ‘sacred beings,’ is exactly similar, in Pahlavi, to shân (in val<i>â</i>shân, ‘their’ p. 21 or ‘those’), a copyist would be liable to the blunder of leaving out the final word in writing val<i>â</i>shân ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân. Or the original writer himself may not have quoted enough of the text he was reading, to make his meaning clear.

[^14]: (21:1) A sacred and mythical tree, described in Bd. XVIII, 1-3. and often personified as a sacred being. It is now represented, in Parsi ceremonies, by twigs of a particular plant brought from Persia.

[^15]: (22:1) Meaning the period of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's existence merely as a guardian spirit, the first period of the destroyer (§ 17) who then remained powerless in confusion (see Bd. I, 22).

[^16]: (22:2) Or ‘sheltering with’ (ham-kar<i>î</i><i>k</i>îh).

[^17]: (22:3) The personifications of the Avesta phrases for ‘good thought’ and ‘perfect rectitude,’ who are two of the seven that hold a superior position among sacred beings, somewhat similar to that of archangels. When a Parsi speaks of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as the first of the Ameshaspends, or archangels, he does not put him on an equality with the rest, any more than we put a commander-in-chief on an equality with his troops when we call him a good soldier.

[^18]: (22:4) Another pronunciation of Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô.

[^19]: (22:5) These last four archangels are personifications of the Avesta p. 23 phrases for ‘desirable dominion, bountiful devotion, completeness or health, and immortality.’

[^20]: (23:1) That is, as an inferior and irresponsible being.

[^21]: (23:2) Here spelt Nêrôsang; see Chaps. I, 29; II, 70; and Zs. XIII, 6, for this angel's influence on the royal race.

[^22]: (23:3) The MS. has 330 years, but the time intended is evidently that shortly before the birth of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and this third 3,000 years. p. 24 ended either when Vi<i>s</i>tâspô accepted the religion, in Zaratû<i>s</i>t's forty-second year, or when Zaratû<i>s</i>t received the religion in his thirtieth year, but this earlier date is the more likely.

[^23]: (24:1) This word, hû-aîbi<i>g</i>adîg, is written in Pahlavi precisely like an-aîbi<i>g</i>adîg, ‘without a destroyer,’ though its meaning is the reverse, which is an unexpected cause of perplexity to a cursory reader.

[^24]: (25:1) Or it may be ‘verdant.’

[^25]: (25:2) Av. Dâitya, a mythic river in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> (Bd. XX, 13); a favourite place for religious rites, see Yt. V, 17, 104, 112; IX, 25, 29; XVII, 45, 49, 61. Or it may be merely mayâ-î shê<i>d</i>, ‘brilliant water.’

[^26]: (25:3) Reading maînôg-dânisnîh, but the MS. has maînôg dênô-dânîh which might be translated ‘spiritual knowledge of religion,’ though the latter Pahlavi word is unusual.

[^27]: (26:1) Compare § 3.

[^28]: (26:2) These two archangels have special charge of water and vegetation (see Sls. XV, 25-29), and here they are represented as acting in a manner usually ascribed to Ti<i>s</i>tar, the Dog-star.

[^29]: (27:1) Reading akha<i>r</i> instead of adên, ‘then.’

[^30]: (27:2) In some places the singular number is used, in others the plural.

[^31]: (28:1) The whirlwind demon; see Bd. XXVIII, 24. Compare Chap. IV, 61.

[^32]: (28:2) The usual effects of a hurricane.

[^33]: (28:3) The mingling of milk with pounded Hôm still constitutes part of the Parsi ceremonial; see Haug's Essays, 3rd ed., p. 405.

[^34]: (28:4) Pahl. ‘ko<i>l</i>â 2 lâlâ fratûm vapdî<i>d</i>ŏ hav<i>â</i>nd.’

[^35]: (29:1) Reading anâg, but it may be intended for hanâ = aê, ‘O.’

[^36]: (29:2) Pahl. ‘<i>a</i>fshân madam hâr s<i>u</i>ftŏ, aêghshânŏ pavan akôsh fr<i>â</i>z va<i>b</i>îdûntô.’

[^37]: (29:3) Evidently an old proverb, implying a fixed determination whatever catastrophe may happen, even if one's ancestors of the eleventh or twelfth generation shall appear. Nô<i>d</i>ar (Av. Naotara) was a son of King Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (Bd. XXXI, 13, 23), and Râk was a nephew of Nô<i>d</i>ar (Bd. XXXI, 31), doubtless the same as Ra<i>g</i>an (Bd. XXXII, 1; XXXIII, 3) which seems to be a Pâzand misreading of Aîri<i>k</i>ŏ, or Êri<i>k</i>ŏ, see Zs. XVI, 11-13, and compare the genealogies in Chap. II, 70 and Zs. XIII, 6. The proverb is used again in Chap. III, 19, and the names are mentioned in III, 39.

[^38]: (30:1) Compare Zs. XIV, 2-5.

[^39]: (30:2) Literally ‘going.’

[^40]: (30:3) Apparently an appeal for mercy.

[^41]: (31:1) Assuming that nîram stands for nîr<i>â</i>, a variant of nûrâ.

[^42]: (31:2) Or ‘terrified with fear.’

[^43]: (32:1) This legend is also told, with further details, in Zs. XII, 7-25.

[^44]: (32:2) Compare Zs. XII, 10.

[^45]: (32:3) The mother of Dahâk, who first committed adultery in an aggravated form (see Dd. LXXII, 5; LXXVIII, 2).

[^46]: (33:1) Pahl. tô<i>r</i>â-î aêvak-dâ<i>d</i>ŏ, the primeval ox, from whom the animals and plants have all descended (see Bd. III, 14, 17, 18; IV. 1-5; X, 1; XIV, 1-3; XXVII, 2).

[^47]: (33:2) The same person as Frangrâsîyâk of Chaps. I, 31, 39; II, 69; XI, 3.

[^48]: (33:3) In Yt. XIX, 56-62; V, 42.

[^49]: (34:1) See Yt. XI-X, 82.

[^50]: (34:2) Compare the genealogy in Zs. XIII, 6; Bd. XXXII, 1, and that quoted there from the Vi<i>g</i>îrka<i>r</i><i>d</i>\-i Dênîg. The names marked here with an asterisk are written in Pâzand, or partly so.

[^51]: (34:3) Ayazem, of Ra<i>g</i>an, in Bd. The latter name is Ra<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>n in Vi<i>g</i>., but Êri<i>k</i>ŏ in Zs. XVI, 13.

[^52]: (34:4) This wants confirmation, but var<i>z</i>î<i>d</i> <i>b</i>ên can hardly be a name as assumed in Vi<i>g</i>., where it is altered to Var<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>\-dên.

[^53]: (34:5) The g is of the old form like s.

[^54]: (34:6) The G is omitted, but see Bd. XXXI, 14.

[^55]: (34:7) Or Kûtâl-tô<i>r</i>â; this generation is omitted both in the Vi<i>g</i>îrka<i>r</i><i>d</i> and Bundahi<i>s</i>.

[^56]: (34:8) This generation is interlined in the MS. of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>. The Bundahi<i>s</i>, XXXI, 7, also omits Nêvak-tô<i>r</i>â; and the Vi<i>g</i>îrka<i>r</i><i>d</i> omits Bôr-tô<i>r</i>â, Sîyah-tô<i>r</i>â, Spêtô-tô<i>r</i>â, and Ramak-tô<i>r</i>â. The termination tô<i>r</i>â is merely the Zvâri<i>s</i> equivalent of g<i>a</i>u. In Irânian MSS. the Pahlavi î and û are practically written alike in most cases.
