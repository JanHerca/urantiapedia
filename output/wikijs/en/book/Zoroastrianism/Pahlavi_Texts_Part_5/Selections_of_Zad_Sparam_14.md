## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER XIV.

1\. About the wonderful striving of the fiend for the destruction of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 2. When it became near to his birth, the Fever demon, the Pain demon, and the Wind demon of Aharman, each one with 150 demons, have come out to kill Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ from his spirit they have gone forth to his mother. 3. And she is hurried from there by Fever, Pain, and Wind; and at _the distance of_ one league (parasang) _there_ was a wizard, Impudent (Storkŏ) by name, who was the most medical of wizards; in hope of practice he stood up from his seat, as she stopped in her progress.

4\. A messenger _of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> uttered a cry thus: 'Do not go to a wizard! for they are not healing (bêshazinî<i>d</i>âr) for thee; but go back to the house, wash _thy_ hands on the morrow with cow's butter held over the fire, also burn (tâpŏ) [^1] firewood <span id="p141"><sup><small>[ p. 141 ]</small></sup></span> _and_ incense for thy own self _and thy_ progeny which is in thy womb.' 5. And she acted accordingly and became well [^2]; _and_ the co-operators of the demon, _and_ those of equal power, who _had_ not obtained their remedy from her body, are again exposed [^3], and spoke thus: ‘On account of the existence of fire from all sides we have not succeeded; _it is_ a help for every one who is her friend more than opponent; therefore it was not for us, because of the power within her.’

6\. The same night as she gave birth, Aharman selected commanders and arrayed his champions (gû<i>r</i>d); there are _some_ who _are_ with one thousand demons, and there are _some_ who _are_ with two thousand demons; pursuing _and_ attacking they have contended. 7. The opposing stand _of_ the sacred, beings [^4], especially of the glory itself at the family [^5] fire, was manifest at that birth; and for its splendour and brightness (pa<i>d</i>rôkŏ), settled opposite a distant place, they have then found no remedy.

8\. At last, Aharman sends Akômanô [^6] on, and spoke to him thus: ‘Thou canst be very spiritual, who canst be most intimate; thou canst go with deceit into the mind of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and make him turn <span id="p142"><sup><small>[ p. 142 ]</small></sup></span> _his_ mind to us who are demons.’ 9. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sends Vohûmanô on against him; Akômanô advanced to the front, _and_ had come forward to the door, _and_ wished to go inside.

10\. Vohûmanô schemingly (<i>k</i>ârakŏgarîhâ) turned [^7] back, and exclaimed to Akômanô thus: ‘Go inside!’ 11. Akômanô imagined thus: ‘_There_ is nothing to be accomplished by me of what _was_ mentioned to me, for Vohûmanô has gone back.’ 12. And Vohûmanô went inside, _and_ mingled with the reason (vârôm) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t laughed outright [^8], for Vohûmanô is a gratifying spirit.

13\. Also seven wizards [^9] were seated before him, _and_ owing to the light in the dwelling, his _having_ laughed at birth was conveniently seen, which is opposed to the _habit_ of the rest of mankind who cry out at birth _and_ are quite terrified.

14\. Also, at the same time of birth, he authoritatively accepted the religion from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as it is stated in revelation, that he spoke at birth thus: ‘As is the will of the spiritual lord (ahvô) mayst thou be who art the officiating priest (zôtŏ) (that is, mayst thou be the leader of the creatures) [^10].’

15\. As Zaratû<i>s</i>t, on account of his worldly body, spoke with a worldly voice, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke _in_ reply to him, on account of the spirits, thus: ‘So <span id="p143"><sup><small>[ p. 143 ]</small></sup></span> mayst thou be the priestly authority (ra<i>d</i> shâe), and so mayst thou be virtuous, owing to whatsoever righteousness _occurs;_ and I confidently proclaim _thee_ righteous (that is, I am thy controller) [^11].’

16\. Another day, Pôrûshaspô went and enquired of the wizards who kept in front at the place, thus: ‘What is the _cause_ when infants cry out at birth, beyond that _which occurs_ when they laugh out-right [^12]?’ 17. And they replied thus: ‘Because _those who_ are made to cry _have_ seen mortality as _their_ end, _and those_ having laughed _have_ seen their own righteousness.’
