## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1]. CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. About the five dispositions of priests, and the ten admonitions with which all instruction as to religion is connected [^2].

2\. Of those five dispositions the first is innocence.

3\. The second is discrimination among [^3] thoughts, words, and deeds; \[to fully distinguish the particulars of destruction from indestructiveness, _such_ as <span id="p168"><sup><small>[ p. 168 ]</small></sup></span> noxious creatures from cattle; and of production from unproductiveness, _such_ as the righteous _and_ worthy from the wicked _and_ unworthy\].

4\. The third is authoritativeness, because that priestly master is always wiser and speaking more correctly who is taught wisely and teaches with more correct words.

5\. The fourth is to [^1] \[understand _and_ consider the ceremonial as the ceremonial of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _and_ the essentials with all goodness, beneficence, _and_ authority; to be steadfast in his religion, and to consider the indications of protection (sâyag) [^2] which are established for his religion. 6. To maintain the reverence of the luminaries prayerfully, _also_ the reverence of the emanations [^3] _from_ the six [^4] _archangels_, be they fire, be they earth, _or_ be they of bodily form, and of the creatures _which_ are formed by them; also the pure cleansing from dead matter, menstruation, bodily refuse, and ether hurtfulness; this is in order that they _may_ be characterised, and thereby constituted, _as_ better-principled, more sensible [^5], and purer, and they _may_ become less faulty. 7. The reverence of mankind is to consider authoritatively about knowledge _and_ property; the reverence of cattle is _about_ fodder, little hardship, and moderate maintenance; the reverence of plants is _about_ sowing and ripening for the food of the worthy. 8. The ceremonial which is glorifying all <span id="p169"><sup><small>[ p. 169 ]</small></sup></span> the sacred beings, praises the luminaries _and_ worldly creations improperly, and is antagonistic to them, because complete glorification is proper through complete recitation of the ritual; and the ceremonial of any one whatever is his own proper duty professionally, so long as it is possible to, keep proceeding with very little sinfulness\].

9\. The fifth is to struggle prayerfully [^1], day and night, with your own fiend [^2], _and all_ life long not to depart from steadfastness; nor allow _your_ proper duty [^3] _to go_ out of _your_ hands.

10\. And the first of those ten admonitions is to proceed with good repute, for the sake of occasioning approving remarks _as to_ [^4] the good repute of _your_ own guardian _and_ teacher, high-priest _and_ master [^5].

11\. The second is to become awfully refraining from evil repute, for the sake of evil repute not occurring _to_ relations and guardians.

12\. The third is not to beat _your_ own teacher with a snatched-up stick, and not to bring scandal upon his name, for the sake of annoying him, by _uttering_ that which _was_ not heard from _your_ own teacher.

13\. The fourth is _that_ whatever is taught liberally by your own teacher, _you have_ to deliver back to the worthy, for the sake of not extorting a declaration of renown from the righteous [^6].

14\. The fifth is _that_ the reward of doers of good <span id="p170"><sup><small>[ p. 170 ]</small></sup></span> works _and_ the punishment of criminals _have to be_ established by law, for the sake of progress [^1].

15\. The sixth is to keep the way of the good open to _your_ house, for the sake of making [^2] righteousness welcome in _your_ own abode.

16\. The seventh is _that_, for the sake of not developing the fiend insensibly in _your_ reason, _you are_ not to keep _it_ with the religion of the good [^3], nor to remain in impenitence of sin.

17\. The eighth [^4] is _that_, for the sake of severing the fiend from the reason, _you have_ to force malice _away_ from _your_ thoughts, and to become quickly repentant of sin.

18\. The ninth is to fully understand the forward movement [^5] of the religion, also to keep the advancing of the religion further forwards, and to seek _your_ share of duty therein; and on a backward movement, when adversity happens to the religion, to have the religion back again, and to keep _your_ body in the continence (makavadîh) of religion.

19\. The tenth is _that there is_ to be a period of obedience (Srôshdârîh) towards the ruler and priestly authority, the high-priesthood of the religious [^6].

## Footnotes

[167:1](sbe4731_htm.html) This chapter ends the first series of Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, and is immediately followed in the MSS. by a second series. It is evident from the extent of this chapter, as compared with the amount of text contained in the three misplaced folios (see p. 162, n; 3), that this chapter could have occupied only about one folio and a half in the dislocated MS., so that the second series must have commenced on the same folio as contained the end of this chapter, and that Chaps. XXIV, XXV cannot have belonged to this series. The three misplaced folios contain two distinct texts; the first (Chap. XXIV) is an Iranian version of the Five Dispositions of priests and the Ten Admonitions, and is here translated; the second (Chap. XXV) contains some details about the Nasks and Gâthas, and has been already translated in S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 401-405.

[^2]: (167:2) This Iranian version of the Dispositions and Admonitions is more complete than the Indian version, which, like the Bundahi<i>s</i>, was brought from Irân five or six centuries ago, and is found in two MSS. (Pt. and J) written in India about 500 years ago, and now in the libraries of Dastûrs Dr. Peshotan and Di. Jâmâsp, respectively. Passages which occur only in the Iranian version are here enclosed in brackets, and other differences between the two versions are mentioned in the notes.

[^3]: (167:3) The Indian version has ‘of.’

[^1]: (168:1) Ind. vers. has only: ‘to celebrate the ceremonial of the sacred beings with the correct words, inward prayers, and complete mastery of the text (narm-nasgîhâ) in the ritual.’ It omits §§ 6-8 altogether.

[^2]: (168:2) T has ‘limit (kûstak).’

[^3]: (168:3) T has ‘issue.’

[^4]: (168:4) T has ‘seven.’

[^5]: (168:5) Or ‘more fragrant;’ hû-bôdtar has both meanings.

[^1]: (169:1) Ind. vers. has: ‘to remain in diligence intelligently.’

[^2]: (169:2) Ind. vers. has: ‘opponent.’

[^3]: (169:3) Ind. vers. has: ‘steadfastness in religion, and to be diligent in _your_ proper duty.’ But it omits the rest of the sentence.

[^4]: (169:4) Ind. vers. has: ‘for the sake of the appropriateness of.’

[^5]: (169:5) Or ‘father.’

[^6]: (169:6) T has: ‘not extracting the purity of the righteous.’

[^1]: (170:1) Ind. vers. adds: ‘of religion.’

[^2]: (170:2) Ind. vers. inserts: ‘a token of;’ and T has: ‘making the righteousness of the sacred beings in writing welcome.’

[^3]: (170:3) Ind. vers. has: ‘not to maintain malice with the good,’ which is more probable, and kênŏ, ‘malice,’ is easily corrupted into dênô, ‘religion,’ in Pahlavi writing.

[^4]: (170:4) This eighth admonition is omitted in the Irânian MSS.

[^5]: (170:5) Ind. vers. adds: ‘and backward movement.’

[^6]: (170:6) Chapter XXV, about the three divisions of revelation, is translated in S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 401-405.
