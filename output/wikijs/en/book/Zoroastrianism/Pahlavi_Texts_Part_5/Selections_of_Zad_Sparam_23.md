## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1]. CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. On the completion of revelation, that is, at the end of the ten years, Mê<i>d</i>yômâh, son of Arâstâî, became faithful to Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

2\. Afterwards, on _having_ obtained _his_ requests [^1], he came back to the conference of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and he spoke thus: ‘In ten years _only_ one man _has been_ attracted by me.’ 3. _And_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘_There will_ be days when so few _are_ not attracted by you, who _are_ themselves the occasion of the resurrection of the world; when, apart from Dahâk [^2], the beneficence of the formation of the renovation _of the universe_ attracts every one besides, and the impenitence of Dahâk is destroyed.’

4\. When he came out from the presence of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, with the same paradox, he thereby indicated his religion as complete to Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> through _his_ intelligence.

5\. In the two years after that [^3], the Kavîgs and <span id="p164"><sup><small>[ p. 164 ]</small></sup></span> Karaps of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, _in_ the manner of opponents (hamêstarânîh), propounded thirty-three enquiries (khvâstakŏ) [^1] to him, so that _by_ command of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp he became the explainer of those thirty-three enquiries. 6. Of the thirty-three habits [^2] of iniquity, come for opposition to the religion of the sacred beings; of the declaration, by revelation, of those thirty-three indications of fetters [^3]; _and_ of the restraint of the thirty-three iniquitous practices by the thirty-three best good works, _there are_ statements in revelation. 7. Including the acceptance of the religion _by_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp from Zaratû<i>s</i>t, after the redemonstration of its judicially multiform prophecy and spiritual character, which are looked into through the evidence of three speakers about _them_, the archangels who, with worldly manifestation, have become apparent unto Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and _his_ councillors _and_ mighty ones; _they_ are Vohûmanô, A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô, and the Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mit<i>r</i>ô fire [^4].

8\. About the reward which _existed_ before the beneficence of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and _its_ being seen how, through guidance by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _it_ is demonstrated by him to those of the world, so that Mê<i>d</i>yômâh is attracted in the tenth year in the forest of reedy hollows (kanyâstânŏ [^5] vê<i>s</i>akŏ) which is the haunt of swine of the wild-boar _species_ (khazûrâ-î var<i>â</i><i>z</i>ŏ gâs); in the twentieth year the Kavîg who is son <span id="p165"><sup><small>[ p. 165 ]</small></sup></span> of Kûndah [^1] is attracted; in the thirtieth year the Khyôns [^2] arrive, who make an incursion (var<i>d</i>akŏ) into the countries of Irân, owing to the Kavîgs, those who are more of their own race; and in the fortieth year Vohûnêm, son of Avarô<i>s</i>tar [^3], is born.

9\. In the forty-seventh year Zaratû<i>s</i>t passes away, who attains seventy-seven years and forty days in the month A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô, _on_ the day Khûr [^4]; _and_ for eight rectified (vêhi<i>k</i>akŏ) months, till the month Dadvô and day Khûr, he should be brought _forward_ as to be reverenced.

10\. _In_ the same month A<i>r</i><i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>tô, in the sixty-third [^5] year, Frashô<i>s</i>tar [^6] passed away, and in the sixty-fourth year <i>G</i>âmâsp [^7], _the same_ as became the priest of priests after Zaratû<i>s</i>t; in the seventy-third year Hangâûrûsh, son of <i>G</i>âmâsp [^8]; in the eightieth year Asmôk-khanvatô [^9], and _also_ in the eightieth <span id="p166"><sup><small>[ p. 166 ]</small></sup></span> year Kabed-û<i>s</i>\-spâê [^1], who is called also Akht the wizard, is killed.

11\. Of the six great upholders of the religion there are the two daughters of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, whose names are Frênŏ and Srîtŏ [^2], _with_ Aharûbŏ-stôtô, _son_ of Mê<i>d</i>yômâh [^3], and another three, who _are_ renowned for their religion for a hundred years, who are Vohûnêm [^4] that is born in the fortieth year of the religion, Sênô [^5] is _afterwards_ born and passes away in the two-hundredth year, _and_ as to his hundred-discipledom [^6], it exists day and night till the three-hundredth year. 12. Afterwards the religion is disturbed and the monarchy is contested (<i>g</i>angî-aîtŏ).

13\. About the three customs (dâ<i>d</i>ŏ) which Zaratû<i>s</i>t prescribed as the best:—The first of them is this: ‘Do not go without others, except with magisterial authority (apatkâr ra<i>d</i>îhâ);’ the second is: ‘Though they shall proceed unlawfully as to you, consider _your_ actions lawfully beforehand;’ _and_ the third is: ‘Next-of-kin marriage, for the <span id="p167"><sup><small>[ p. 167 ]</small></sup></span> sake of the pure progress of _your_ race, is the best of the actions _of_ the living, which _are_ provided for the proper begetting of children [^1].’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (163:1) That is, the replies of the archangels to his enquiries.

[^2]: (163:2) See Dk. VII, i, 26. He was chained by Frê<i>d</i>ûn in Mount Dimâvand, to escape in the latter days, to he slain by Keresâsp, and to be specially punished at the resurrection (Bd. XII, 31; XXX, 16; Byt. III, 55-61).

[^3]: (163:3) See Dk. VII, iv, 2.

[^1]: (164:1) See Dk. VII, iv, 67.

[^2]: (164:2) Reading <i>s</i>ôn = Pers. sân; but the MSS. have dênô, ‘religions.’ The thirty sins and thirty-three good works, detailed in Mkh.. XXXVI, XXXVII, are certainly referred to at the end of this section.

[^3]: (164:3) Compare Chap. XII, 5, and Dk. VII, iv, 67.

[^4]: (164:4) See Dk. VII, iv, 74.

[^5]: (164:5) Hybrid Zvâri<i>s</i> of Pers. nayistân.

[^1]: (165:1) Or Kûnîh which is the name of a demon (see Sg. XVI, 13, 16, 18, 19); but such an identification is uncertain.

[^2]: (165:2) Av. <i>H</i><i>v</i>yaona of Yt. IX, 30, 31; XVII, 50, 51. Compare Dk. VII, iv, 77, 83, 84, 87-90; V, 7.

[^3]: (165:3) Av. gen. ‘Vohu-nemang,hô Avârao<i>s</i>trôi<i>s</i>’ of Yt. XIII, 104.

[^4]: (165:4) The eleventh day of the second month.

[^5]: (165:5) T has 43d, and the date is lost in the other MS. authority. But 43d is highly improbable for two reasons: first, it would make this date the only one out of chronological order in the series here given; secondly, it would render it inconsistent with the statement, in Dk. VII, vi, 12, that two priests came, from other regions, to ask Frashô<i>s</i>tar about the religion, fifty-seven years after it had been accepted by Zaratû<i>s</i>t. By substituting 63d (the Pahlavi cipher most likely to be corrupted into 43d) both these inconsistencies are removed.

[^6]: (165:6) See Dk. VII, vi, 12; V, ii, 12.

[^7]: (165:7) See Dk. V, ii, 12; iii, 4.

[^8]: (165:8) Av. gen. ‘Hang,haurushô <i>G</i>âmâspanahê’ of Yt. XIII, 104.

[^9]: (165:9) Av. gen. ‘Asmô-<i>h</i><i>v</i>anvatô’ of Yt. XIII, 96, and Westergaard's Yt. XXII, 37.

[^1]: (166:1) As kabed is Zvâri<i>s</i> for ‘many,’ we may assume that kabed-û<i>s</i> =Av. nom. pouru<i>s</i> which usually becomes pouru in compounds; so that the compound name, or title, in the text, probably represents Av. Pouruspâdha (Yt. X, 109, 111), ‘having many troops,’ a suitable title for Akht the wizard (Av. Akhtya of Yt. V, 82) who is said, in Gf. I, 2, to have invaded a district with an army of seven myriads. He was killed, in Zoroastrian fashion, by the recital of a religious formula.

[^2]: (166:2) There was a third daughter, Pôru<i>k</i>îst (see Bd. XXXII, 5), but she may not have survived her father.

[^3]: (166:3) Av. gen. ‘Ashastvô Maidhyôi-m<i>a</i>ung,hôi<i>s</i>’ of Yt. XIII, 106.

[^4]: (166:4) See § 8.

[^5]: (166:5) He was born in the tooth year; see Dk. VII, vii, 6.

[^6]: (166:6) This seems to be the sixth upholder of the religion, the third of those lasting about a century.

[^1]: (167:1) This chapter ends the first series of Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam, and is immediately followed in the MSS. by a second series. It is evident from the extent of this chapter, as compared with the amount of text contained in the three misplaced folios (see p. 162, n; 3), that this chapter could have occupied only about one folio and a half in the dislocated MS., so that the second series must have commenced on the same folio as contained the end of this chapter, and that Chaps. XXIV, XXV cannot have belonged to this series. The three misplaced folios contain two distinct texts; the first (Chap. XXIV) is an Iranian version of the Five Dispositions of priests and the Ten Admonitions, and is here translated; the second (Chap. XXV) contains some details about the Nasks and Gâthas, and has been already translated in S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 401-405.
