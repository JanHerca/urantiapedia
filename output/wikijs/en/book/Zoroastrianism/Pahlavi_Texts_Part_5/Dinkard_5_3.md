## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK V. CHAPTER III.

1\. About that which is manifested as regards the propitiousness, forward intellect, and complete virtue of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, it is openly declared that, according to his explaining statements, _there occurred such events_ as the victory of Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and the Irânians over Ar<i>g</i>âsp [^1] and an army of Khyôns and other foreigners _of_ innumerable kinds, _and_ details on that subject; also other assistance of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and those of the realm in other necessities.

2\. The killing of Zaratû<i>s</i>t himself _by_ Brâ<i>d</i>rô-rêsh [^2] the Tûr; the provision of a chariot _by_ Srîtô [^3] of the Vîsraps; and whatever is on those subjects.

3\. Also, specially, matters in the times to come, each consecutively, _when_ therein arrive devastators _such_ as Alexander [^4], and the killer of Akrê-khira<i>d</i>ŏ [^5], Mahrkûs [^6], Dahâk [^7], and other devastators; extenders of belief (vîravî<i>s</i>n-vâlân) _such_ as the Messiah (Mashikh), Mânih [^8], and others; periods _such_ as the steel _age_ [^9], _that_ mingled with iron, and others; and organizers, restorers, _and_ introducers of religion, _such_ <span id="p127"><sup><small>[ p. 127 ]</small></sup></span> as A<i>r</i>takhshatar [^10], Âtû<i>r</i>pâ<i>d</i> [^11], Khûsrôî [^12], Pêshyôtan [^13], Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, Sôshâns [^14], and others.

4\. The formation of custom, and the indications which _have_ come to manifestation and _will_ arrive at various periods; and the proclamation of these, too, by <i>G</i>âmâsp [^15], from the teaching of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, is what he wrote, together with the Avesta and Zand, upon oxhides, and it was written _with_ gold, and kept in the royal treasury [^16]. 5. And it was from it the high-priests of the rulers made many copies and afterwards, too, it is from it that it happened, both to the less intelligent and the corrupters, that _they_ were introducing different opinions _and_ different views.
