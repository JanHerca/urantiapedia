## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM. CHAPTER XIII.

1\. About the glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t becoming manifest even before _his_ birth, _it_ is thus declared, that forty-five years before _the time_ when Zaratû<i>s</i>t came out to his conference [^1], when Frênŏ gave birth _to_ the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^2], whom they called Dûk<i>d</i>ak, it <span id="p139"><sup><small>[ p. 139 ]</small></sup></span> came down from the endless light, in the manner of fire, _and_ mingled with the fire which was before her; _and_ from the fire it mingled with the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^3].

2\. _For_ three nights it was manifest, to all passers-by, as a species of fire _in_ the direction of the house, _and_ passers _on_ the road always saw great radiance. 3. Also when she became fifteen years old, the radiance of that glory which _was_ in her, _was_ even such _that_, on the path she was walking _along_, its brightness _was_ then shed by her [^4].

4\. About the combination of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _whose_ guardian spirit is reverenced; that is, his guardian spirit, in the Hôm, and his glory are given the cow's milk, by his father and mother drinking _it_ up [^5], _and_ his spiritual life (ahvô) came into the combination, as was proclaimed _by_ his statements in the manuscript about the Guidance of the Ceremonial [^6].

5\. About the backward connection of Zaratû<i>s</i>t with Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, through the two who _are_ Yim, the best of the worldly existences, and Nêryôsang of the spirits. 6. The enumeration of the lineage of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _son of_ Pôrûshaspô [^7], of Purtarâspô, <span id="p140"><sup><small>[ p. 140 ]</small></sup></span> of Ahûrva<i>d</i>âspô, of Hâê<i>k</i>a<i>d</i>âspô, of <i>K</i>îkhshnû<i>s</i>, of Paîtiraspô, of Are<i>g</i>a<i>d</i>arsî\*, of Kharedhar\*, of Spîtâmân, of Vaêdî<i>s</i>tô, of Ayazem, of Frî<i>s</i>, of Ari<i>g</i>\*; of Dûrasrôbô, of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, of Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnar, of Mânû<i>s</i>\-khûrnâk, whom Nêryôsang the messenger of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _brought, and_ whose mother was Vîzag, _daughter_ of Aryag, of Srîtak, of Bîtak, of Frazûsak, of Zû<i>s</i>ak, of Fragûzag, of Gûzag, _daughter_ of Aîrî<i>k</i>, _son_ of Frê<i>d</i>ûn of the Âspîgâns to the total of ten Âspîgâns, of Yim, of the Vîvang,has, of the Ayang,has, of the Anang,has, of Hôshâng, of Fravâk, of Sîyâmak, of Masîyâ, of Gâyômar<i>d</i>.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (138:2) That is, forty-five years before he was thirty years old (see Chap. XXI, I-14).

[^2]: (138:3) It is necessary to translate in this manner, to agree with Dk. VII, ii, 3, but the text, which is ambiguous. runs as follows: ‘amat Frênŏg (Frênŏ-î?) Zaratû<i>s</i>t am, zya<i>s</i>ân Dûk<i>d</i>akŏg ka<i>r</i>îtuntô, p. 139 zerkhûntô;’ which might also be translated thus: ‘when Frênŏ, the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, whom they called Dûk<i>d</i>ak, was born.’ This Frênŏ, whether mother or daughter, does not seem to correspond with any Fr<i>e</i>ni mentioned in the Avesta.

[^3]: (139:1) See Dk. VII, ii, 2, 3.

[^4]: (139:2) Ibid. 7, S.

[^5]: (139:3) Ibid. 46, 47.

[^6]: (139:4) Not identified, but probably like the Nîrangistân.

[^7]: (139:5) This genealogy was, no doubt, derived originally from the same source as that in Dk. VII, ii, 70, but there are several variations, especially in orthography, which are here preserved, unless clearly copyist's blunders. The names marked with an asterisk are written in Pâzand.
