## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK V. CHAPTER II.

1\. In the pure light _and_ equal to the archangels—collected together and reckoned together, since the original creation, _and_ completely unmixed—Zaratû<i>s</i>t was spiritually fashioned and provided undefectively for the acceptance and propagation of the religion in the world [^1]. 2. And when he is sent for the manifestation of restrained saintliness (môkîh) and bodily substance, great glory and radiance become as much discernible in _him_ as the same _had_ come into the posterity of Yim who are Pôrûshâspô [^2], his father, _and_ Dûk<i>d</i>âûb [^3] who is his mother; and also while _he_ is _being_ born and _for_ the duration of life, he produced a radiance, glow, and brilliance from the place of his own abode, that issued intensely and strongly, like the splendour of fire, to distant lands [^4].

3\. Also _about_ the wizards and witches, tyrants, Kîgs, and Karaps, and other miscreants who have produced outrage for him during his birth and child-hood, with desire for his destruction; who _have_ manifestly come about _his_ death _or_ disablement, and even so far as _those_ who _have come into_ the visible assembly _about_ the destruction of _his_ glory and other _causes of_ helplessness [^5]. 4. And also including the wolves _and_ other wild beasts, to whom _he was_ <span id="p123"><sup><small>[ p. 123 ]</small></sup></span> cast forth by those of Pôrûshâspô's kinsmen who _were_ wizards, _and_ the kindred of those frequenting demon-worship, but only as a test [^6].

5\. _In_ like manner it is declared _that_, on account of Vohûmanô _being_ welcome to him, he laughed out-right at birth [^7]. 6. His coming for conference _with_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^8], and owing to _his_ accepting the religion, Aharman and many demons and fiends have come to him with exhibition of fear, offering of service, and the argument and entreaty of supplicants; and all these have returned from him disapprovingly, defeatedly, and confusedly, through the pure proclamation of his Avesta, the unique perfection of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s will [^9], and the indication of a prepared armament (vîrâstŏ-zênîh), a declared reward, a powerful sovereignty, and a way of injury _to_ the destroyer.

7\. Also the triumph of the sacred beings _in_ the end, and the peculiarity _of_ the joint control _of_ the demons; how, before that, they rushed openly into the world _and_ have dwindled, _their_ bodily forms _are_ shattered [^10], and they are so converted into secret decay, that _their_ supplicants, deceived and deceivers, became awful disputants through confession of it.

8\. And when, through completely accepting the religion from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, he came to the obedient king Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp to attract those of the world, he exhibited glorious actions of many kinds and the <span id="p124"><sup><small>[ p. 124 ]</small></sup></span> smiting of demons and fiends; and _he_ openly spoke the thoughts of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and many of the multitude _about_ hidden matters [^11], _thus_: ‘A person is possessing life only by destiny, and without his body, _but with_ a like destiny, the person possessing life is restored;’ _he was_ also opposing many wizards, demon-worshippers, demon-consulters, _and_ those seduced _by_ [^12] deceivers who are awful disputants. 9. And this _was_ the utterance of those twelve stars whose names _are those_ of the twelve _zodiacal_ constellations, and the primitive learned of Bâpêl [^13], that have come to these, who _are_ asking questions of the chief rulers of Khvanîras, _have_ to justify _it_, in the controversy, with the spiritual and material customs and rude observances which are diversely manifested, onwards from _the time of_ Yim the splendid; and the evidence of it, discernible with him, _was that of_ Vohûmanô, Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô, the fire, and some other good spirits [^14].

10\. Afterwards, too, the estimating and weighing of the whole utterance of the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _were_ held out by him to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and those of the world, as very accountably a wonder; and further, too, he remained as _it were_ more conflicting with fellow-disputants than his own words opposing the fellow-disputants.

11\. Also when, through the effect of glory and the struggle _for being_ saved, every class of apostles and prophets and manifestation of tokens and such-like _were_, with certain _and_ striking evidence, casting down blessings, even thereupon the obedient king <span id="p125"><sup><small>[ p. 125 ]</small></sup></span> Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp's fear of the adversary of religion, and also other causes, arose, on account of which he _was_ then accepting the propagation of the religion [^15], when its great glory _and_ beauty [^16] _were_ seen by him. 12. At first, Zarîr [^17], Spend-dâ<i>d</i> [^18], Frashô<i>s</i>tar, and <i>G</i>âmâsp [^19], several of the realm _who were_ noble, conspicuous, and well-acting, the good _and_ princes _of_ mankind, beheld visibly the will and desirableness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels, and the progressive religion of the creatures, fit for those completely victorious (hû<i>k</i>îragânîg).

13\. Lastly, the seizure and capturing (gîrini<i>s</i>nŏ) by the demons _are_ beheld _and_ watched; _and_ they have remained opposing, owing to the number _of_ idolators competing wranglingly. 14. And much conflict and slaughter occurred, which arose purely, so that the mingling _of_ the religion in the world proceeded [^20].

15\. _There_ are also his pure new bringers and complete controllers of the same religion, Aûshê<i>d</i>ar [^21], Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh [^22], and Sôshâns [^23]; and through the complete progress of this religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, all the good creatures become without disturbance and all-radiant [^24].
