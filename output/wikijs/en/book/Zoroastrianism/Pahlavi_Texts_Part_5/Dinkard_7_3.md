## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER III.

1\. About the marvellousness which is manifested after the birth of that most auspicious of offsprings from _his_ mother, till his coming to a conference _with_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^1].

2\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that on being born he laughed outright; the seven midwives (dayah) [^2], who sat around him, were quite frightened thereby; and those terrified ones spoke thus: 'What was this, on account of grandeur or contempt? when, like the worthy man whose pleasure is due to activity, the man's child so laughs at the birth owing to him.' 3. Pôrûshâspô also spoke thus: ‘Bring out this man_child_ to the sheep_skin_ clothing which is soft; the affair _was_ owing to thee, owing to the virtue of thee who art Dûk<i>d</i>âûb, that the advent of glory and coming of radiance to this man_child_ _was_ openly seen when he laughed outright at his birth.’

4\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that Pôrûshâspô afterwards went to a Karap, Dûrâsrôbô _by_ name, who was the most renowned for witchcraft in that district, and informed him of the birth of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _and_ the wonders which were manifested <span id="p36"><sup><small>[ p. 36 ]</small></sup></span> therein; he _also_ brought _him_ to the house for the purpose of seeing Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 5. That wizard, owing to the coming _on_ of vexation at that glory in Zaratû<i>s</i>t, desired with evil intention a really mischievous deceit (shê<i>d</i>ŏ), to compress with _his_ paws (gôv) the tender head of that full-glorious child, to cause _his_ death. 6. And here is manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions _it_ thus: ‘Thereupon the paws of that deadly _one_ (mar) _are_ driven back to behind him (that is, reversed (aû<i>s</i>kûn) backwards); nor ever after _did_ that deadly _one_ become again a devourer of meat with _his_ jaws by means of those paws.’ 7. That Karap also, besides that, examined the marks _and_ evil specks on Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^3]; and Pôrûshâspô, _in_ awful alarm as to the dispersion _of_ the emanation of splendour (âp-dihîh) from Zaratû<i>s</i>t, hastened (sârînî<i>d</i>) to make Zaratû<i>s</i>t invisible.

8\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that the Karap Dûrâsrôbô, through witchcraft, cast such fear of Zaratû<i>s</i>t into the mind _of_ Pôrûshâspô, _and_ so injured the mind of Pôrûshâspô, that, owing only to that very fear as regards himself, he asked the Karap for the death of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 9. Also about [^4] the mode of putting to death for which Pôrûshâspô, owing to the distraction (vishôpi<i>s</i>nŏ) by which he becomes helpless, asks Dûrâsrôbô; and that Karap is bringing much firewood together, and to shelter (nipâyî<i>d</i>anŏ) Zaratû<i>s</i>t amid that firewood, to stir up a fire, and to make it blaze with the wood were the remedy he arranged (vîrâstŏ); and Pôrûshâspô acted accordingly. <span id="p37"><sup><small>[ p. 37 ]</small></sup></span> 10. And here is manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions it thus: ‘Neither _was_ fire among the vegetation on a tree (that is, it does not come on), nor _has_ fire seized upon plants; _but_ on rushed, at dawn [^5], that son-loving mother, and she came forth to him intelligently (hûshûmônd), and seizing him, thereby removed him with _her_ right hand aloft as he sat [^6].’

11\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that after Pôrûshâspô spoke to the Karap Dûrâsrôbô about the fire not burning _the child_, he asked anew about putting Zaratû<i>s</i>t to death; _then_ to ensconce (nipâyî<i>d</i>anŏ) Zaratû<i>s</i>t in a narrow path, and despatch many oxen on that path, so that he _may_ be trampled on _by_ the feet of the oxen _at_ night, were the remedy that Karap proposed (girâyî<i>d</i>ŏ) to Pôrûshâspô; and Pôrûshâspô acted accordingly. 12. Here also is manifested a wonder of grandeur to the multitude, just as revelation mentions: ‘It _was_ that ox walked on which _had_ become sorrowful (that is, its sorrow was great owing to another ox) and _it was_ aged and walked before that _one_ (before the leading ox), it _also_ hastened before that _other_ (that is, it stood up before Zaratû<i>s</i>t), _and_ he _was_ greatly pitied by it for the whole day, so that it kept away the oxen from him, _being_ the first _that_ walked thither _and_ the last _that_ walked away; on rushed at dawn that son-loving mother, forth to _him_ she came intelligently, <span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span> and seizing him, thereby removed him with _her_ right hand aloft as he sat [^7].’

13\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that Pôrûshâspô came a second time (îdanŏ) to that Karap also about the oxen not trampling on Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ asked anew about the mode _of_ putting Zaratû<i>s</i>t to death; _then_ to ensconce Zaratû<i>s</i>t _near_ a drinking-pool (<i>â</i><i>v</i>khûr) in the domain (gêhân), and to drive many horses to that drinking-pool, so that he may be trampled on by the hoofs of the horses, were the substituted [^8] remedy that Karap proposed; _and_ Pôrûshâspô acted accordingly. 14. And here is manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions thus: ‘That horse walked on which _had_ become fully-hoofed (that is, its hoofs were very thick); _it is_ yellow-eared and it walks before that _one_ (before the leading horse), and it hastens before that _other_ (that is, it stood up before Zaratû<i>s</i>t), and _was_ the first _that_ walked on thither, and the last _that_ walked away; on rushed at dawn that son-loving mother, forth to him she came intelligently, and seizing him, thereby removed him with _her_ right hand aloft as he sat [^9].’

15\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that Pôrûshâspô _came_ again to that Karap, spoke also about the horses, too, not trampling on Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and asked anew as to what _may be_ the mode _of_ putting <span id="p39"><sup><small>[ p. 39 ]</small></sup></span> Zaratû<i>s</i>t to death; _then_ to have Zaratû<i>s</i>t carried off into the den (sûrâk) where a wolf's cubs (hûnû<i>s</i>kân) _are_ slaughtered, so that when the wolf arrives _and_ sees the slaughtered cubs, she _will_ wrathfully growl _and_ mangle Zaratû<i>s</i>t in revenge for those cubs, was the remedy that Karap proposed; and Pôrûshâspô acted accordingly. 16. _And_ here is manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions: ‘It is when that wolf came on, several Yû<i>g</i>yâsts [^10], towards Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the wolf _was_ struck dumb by the assistance of the sacred beings, so that its mouth _was_ down _at_ the cubs, one with the other.’

17\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that Srôsh [^11] the righteous _and_ Vohûmanô proceeded to him, and a woolly (kûrû<i>s</i>ak) _sheep_ was brought by them unto him; the nurses (dâyagân) [^12] also _were_ terrified, apart from him, the whole night. 18. _Then_ on rushed at dawn that son-loving mother, forwards from the position _of_ that woolly _sheep_ she walked, and she, the mistress of the domain (zan-î gehân), spoke thus: ‘Thou runnest on violently (ûtayûtŏ) in excess;’ for she considered in this _way_, that ‘the wolf is so much better to that son than thou art [^13] good to me, when I shall show _his_ [^14] bone or blood in thy sight [^15].’ 19. Forwards to him has she come <span id="p40"><sup><small>[ p. 40 ]</small></sup></span> intelligently and, seizing him, she thereby removed him, through the grace (dahi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the sacred beings, aloft as he sat; and she, the mistress of the domain, spoke thus: ‘I _shall_ not give thee up again, my son, not even though both Râk and Nô<i>d</i>ar _should_ arrive here together [^16].’

20\. And _it_ is declared that, afterwards, the Karap Dûrâsrôbô, with a malicious disciple, came to the same district and noticed about the advancement of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; and they saw no means for injuring _or_ putting _him_ to death, but his condition (mindavam) _was_ a marvel as full of vigour as this which is declared, that Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh, the Karap, growled thus:—21. 'Then I, _who_ am the most far-seeing of the people in that district of ours as to witchcraft, see upon their district that well-directing (that is, he understands good commands) produce _of_ development (that is, the increase which continually becomes more, which _has_ come and which _will_ arrive), with good flocks (that is, he understands to keep good sheep), with good herds (that is, he understands to keep a herd which is better _than_ another's), the well-exerting (that is, he understands to do work which is better _than_ another's), well-fighting (that is, he understands to do battle well), and perfectly liberal (that is, he understands to exercise beneficial liberality) bantling (hûnû<i>s</i>kŏ) of Pôrûshâspô [^17], in the three nights while he was begotten out of <span id="p41"><sup><small>[ p. 41 ]</small></sup></span> his parents. 22. Unto him _will_ Vohûmanô come in the embodied world (that is, Vohûmanô _will_ come unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t), and conducting him unto a conference, his good religion _will_ extend into the seven regions _of_ the earth; and so I _shall_ not even let him produce in _his_ mind (that is, he _will_ not know) where _and_ how I _shall_ murder him; and a token of this matter, that _one_ speaks truly, is this, that I state _it_ beforehand, promptly after the full hearing of the statement of the matter, when you heard this statement.'

23\. Pôrûshâspô advanced, conveyed in a four-in-hand chariot [^18]; then, on hearing that statement, _and_ when they had heard that statement, Pôrûshâspô started forth, conveyed in that four-in-hand chariot. 24. And Pôrûshâspô spoke to Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh, the Karap, thus: ‘Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh, _thou_ Karap! whatever men they shall behold, cry out when at birth; even the offspring of that secluded person they behold in death, cry out when at birth [^19]; _but_ what _was_ that which _they_ beheld _at_ the birth of my son? 25. When at birth he laughed outright; _was_ that also beheld _in_ thy son, when at birth did he laugh outright? 26. When Vohûmanô comes unto him, into _this_ embodied existence, _it_ is also said by him on _his_ return: "<i>O</i> Pôrûshâspô! where is thy servant [^20]?" So, <i>O</i> Karap! concerning him who is my son, _it is_ beheld that _he was_ seen sagaciously by thee.’ <span id="p42"><sup><small>[ p. 42 ]</small></sup></span> 27\. And [^21] when Pôrûshâspô enquired of him thus: ‘What was the _matter_ with thee when, through bringing thee unto that son of mine, _he was_ thereby offered; and thou lookedst long up away from him in height, and thou lookedst long down away from him in depth, and thou lookedst long out away from him in different directions?’ 28. The Tûrânian, Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh the Karap, spoke _in_ reply thus: ‘When through bringing me unto that son _was thy_ offering of him, and I [^22] looked long up away from him in height, then the radiance _and_ glory out of him kept together up to the sun, _and_ through him [^23] I have accompanied _them_ on the boundary _of its_ radiance _and_ glory; so that I saw this, that mankind through speaking to the soul may attain to the firmament of the sun; _but_ this, namely, how the routine (dâ<i>d</i>istânŏ) is in the supreme heaven, was not seen by me. 29. When through bringing me unto that son of thine _was thy_ offering of him, and I looked long down in depth away from _thy_ offering of him, then the radiance and glory out of him kept together unto the sky which is below this earth, and through him  [^24] to the boundary of _its_ radiance and glory; _but_ this, namely, how the routine is in that sky, _was_ not seen by me. 30. And when through bringing me unto that son of thine _was thy_ offering of him, and I looked long out away from him in different directions, then the radiance _and_ glory from him kept together for adorning this earth, _and_  <span id="p43"><sup><small>[ p. 43 ]</small></sup></span> through him I have accompanied _them_ on the boundary of _its_ radiance _and_ glory; so that I saw this, that only from the action of this _one_ the future existence _will_ arise; but the routine of the future existence _was_ not seen by me. 31. This son of thine thinks thus: “I _will_ make a grander material existence than that of _any_ other;” so he _will_ also make thy spiritual _one_, where thou goest; _and_ this son of thine _will_ remain in the great protection _of_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, not in thine.’

32\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that when Zaratû<i>s</i>t was seven years old, that Dûrâsrôbô being joined by Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh the Karap at the village of Pôrûshâspô, on account of the little previous seeing of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _by the latter_, they saw Zaratû<i>s</i>t in that neighbourhood when a hut (kâ<i>d</i>akŏ) was constructed by him with the children; and they sat with evil intention to injure the mind of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through witchcraft, and for that reason fear and terror _were_ cast by them upon the children. 33. Here a great wonder became manifest to them, owing to the powerful intellect, cautiousness, and practice of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, just as revelation mentions thus: ‘When the other children were excessively terrified at their own silliness of speech, Zaratû<i>s</i>t did not quite close the eye in his mind as regards them.’

34\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that when these two Karaps came to the dwelling of Pôrûshâspô, he ordered the preparation of food for their eating; and his prepared food is chewed up (fr<i>â</i><i>z</i> khayâî-aît), _with_ a gobletful (pûr dôlakŏ) of mare's milk. 35. He also spoke to Dûrâsrôbô thus: ‘Thou art the most spirit-worshipping [^25] of mankind <span id="p44"><sup><small>[ p. 44 ]</small></sup></span> in our district; do thou worship this of mine.’ 36. A great marvel, owing to the sagacity of Zaratû<i>s</i>t at a childish age, is just as revelation mentions that Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘I worship this, <i>O</i> father! _it is_ not that which it is necessary for me to worship _that_ he should worship.’ 37. And Pôrûshâspô spoke thus: ‘_It is_ not that of mine thou worshippest, _and_ it is that of mine he should worship.’ 38. As many as three times those persons (gab<i>r</i>âân) carried on those assertions; _when_ up stood Zaratû<i>s</i>t and spoke concerning them, and he broke forth with that eternal statement [^26], namely: ‘The righteous I reverence, men _or_ women; the poor I reverence, men _or_ women; _not_ the wicked, men or women; when any one whatever shall join Pôrûshâspô, where he shall be celebrating worship, the worship shall then be suitable to the worshippers, that is, he shall worship that which it is necessary to worship.’

39\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that afterwards Dûrâsrôbô the Karap shouted to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘Evil was thy reckoning [^27] which, owing to the conduct of fate (bâhar), I, the foremost of the existences embodied in Râk and Nô<i>d</i>âr [^28], bring to thee; I am made further worthy where thy fate is carried away from me; now is the joy (parkân) which I convey to him [^29] through bringing it on, and this <span id="p45"><sup><small>[ p. 45 ]</small></sup></span> _will_ occur, so that I may observe he _will_ kill thee with the evil eye in the house.’ 40. And here is a great wonder which became manifest about Zaratû<i>s</i>t, in the sagacity of _his_ reply to that deadly _one_ at that childish age, which _was_ just like this which revelation mentions, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘Without the joy of a murderer I observe, with propitiousness and complete mindfulness, that it is thee I notice in that house which is thine [^30].’

41\. One _marvel_ is that which, after this reply of Zaratû<i>s</i>t to Dûrâsrôbô, became manifest in that Karap, just as revelation mentions thus: ‘The deadly _one_ became disabled and stupefied as long as the milking of ten mares _in_ milk whose milker is _only_ one.’

42\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that when that wizard emerged from _that_ stupefaction, he then shouted again to Zaratû<i>s</i>t _in_ the same manner, Zaratû<i>s</i>t uttered that same reply, _and_ the deadly _one_ became anew disabled and stupefied as long as the milking of twenty mares full of milk whose milker _is only one_.

43\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that again when that wizard emerged from _that_ stupefaction, he then shouted to Zaratû<i>s</i>t _in_ the same manner, Zaratû<i>s</i>t uttered that same reply, _and_ the deadly _one_ becomes anew disabled and stupefied as long as the milking of thirty mares full of milk whose milker is _only_ one.

44\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared, that when that wizard emerged from that stupefaction, he <span id="p46"><sup><small>[ p. 46 ]</small></sup></span> then grumbled thus: ‘Do ye have the horse driven for us, and turn round the chariot wherein you harness _it_; for really this smiting _one_ (ganâk) _will_ destroy me through the arrival of the _sacred_ text _and_ through _his_ possession of authority.’ _So_ they had the horse driven, and _it was_ harnessed to the chariot by them. 45. And here is manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions thus ‘When he _had_ proceeded several Yû<i>g</i>yâsts [^31] in driving, he stopped in his distress through being terrified, _and_ this occurred which I mention for a warning [^32], his semen _was_ expelled, so that it arose in his skin and burst it [^33], and _his_ loin thereby broke from _his_ thigh; he then died outright, then his progeny, and then the offspring of his progeny.’

46\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared that, even before the coming of _Zaratû<i>s</i>t_ to a conference [^34], _there_ is manifested in him a mind which is more capacious than the whole world, _and_ more exalted than every worldly possession, with an understanding whose strength is perfectly selected, an intellect of all-acquiring power, and a sagacity of all-deciding ability also with the much heedfulness _of_ the kingly glory, and the full desire for righteousness, the efficacious diligence and authority, and even the superiority in mightiness and grandeur of the priestly glory. 47. Also the handsomeness of body _and_ completeness of strength which are in the character _of_ these four classes of his, which are priesthood, <span id="p47"><sup><small>[ p. 47 ]</small></sup></span> warriorship, husbandry, and artisanship; _besides_ a perfect friendship for the sacred beings _and_ the good, _and_ an awful enmity for the demons _and_ the vile. 48. That is the nature by which the habits (dâ<i>d</i>ŏîh) of mankind _and_ bipeds, the perfection and completeness of the sacred beings through the creativeness of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and its _own_ commemoration _of them_ are provided. 49. So that the sacred beings shall bring a report, as to his superiority, from every one of those who are _and_ were _and_ will be, _and_ of his coming for reminding _us of_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and _of_ the lord-and-mastership (a hû-va-ra<i>d</i>îh) of the world, _also of_ the preservation of the creations therein (ay<i>î</i>pŏ-dahi<i>s</i>nân), from the destroyer, by the tongue of the many-mannered (kabed-sarâ<i>d</i>akŏ) sage, the fully-virtuous _one_ of the age producing no harm (avazand-dahîg) in the world. 50. And the demons on this _account_, that this is _he_ whom many Kîgs [^35]1 _and_ Karaps _have_ to influence the good to confound _and_ destroy, then also kept _their_ promise and practised friendship.

51\. And on the completion of thirty years beyond his birth [^36] the archangel Vohûmanô came on in commemoration of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, when _he was_ bringing his Hôm-water (mayâ-î Hômîgân) [^37] from the <span id="p48"><sup><small>[ p. 48 ]</small></sup></span> river Aêvatâk [^38], just as this which revelation mentions thus: ‘When Zaratû<i>s</i>t came forth to the third effluent (ba<i>r</i>â-ta<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nîh), that of the good Dâîtî, he further proceeded through that; and when he marched onwards from that, a man _was_ seen by him, who marched from the southern quarter. 52. That was Vohûmanô, and it seemed _to_ him _that_ Vohûmanô _was_ of early form (so that he is more discerning as to a person) and foreseeing (that is, he was beforehand in everything); it seemed _to_ him _that_ Vohûmanô _was_ as much _in_ height as three men's spears; and it seemed _to_ him, _as to_ Vohûmanô that a glossy twig (arûs tâk) _was_ brought by him in _his_ hand, through carrying off which branch the plant _was_ not injured by him; that became the spiritual twig of the religion, and this _was_ indicated by it, that it is necessary to proceed as uninjuriously by the religion. 53. There is _some one_ who says that it became a reminder of the spiritual _existence_, and this _was_ indicated by it, that it is necessary to proceed as uninjuriously in the world, so that peace may exist with every one.

54\. When he came onward to the fourth effluent, as far as the Aûshân-rû<i>d</i> of the good Dâîti (which was the name of it) and _he was_ in it, Zaratû<i>s</i>t was bringing the Hôm-water from the middle of it; and on the ascent Zaratû<i>s</i>t, bringing his right foot out of the Aûshân-rû<i>d</i>, covered _himself_ with his clothes, and upon that Vohûmanô, advancing, joined him in front. <span id="p49"><sup><small>[ p. 49 ]</small></sup></span> 55\. And that man enquired of him thus: ‘Who art thou; from whom of them art thou [^39]?’ _He replied_: ‘I am Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^40] of the Spîtâmas.’

56\. The words of Vohûmanô _were_: ‘<i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! about what is thy foremost distress (that is, for what is thy need when thou becomest quite distressed); about what is thy foremost endeavour; and for what is the tendency of thy desire (lak kâmakŏ-dahi<i>s</i>nîh)?’ 57. The reply of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _was_ thus: ‘About righteousness, I consider _my_ foremost distress; about righteousness _my_ foremost endeavour; and for righteousness the tendency of my desire (that is, my need is for that thing, and I am a distressed seeker of righteousness).’

58\. The words of Vohûmanô _were_: '<i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! that which is righteousness is existing (that is, a real thing is, as _it were_, that which is righteousness), so that whatever is that which is righteousness is thus what is one's own.' 59. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘That which is righteousness exists, and concerning that I am completely clear and aware; _but_ where _and_ how is that radiance which is that whose arrival is through Vohûmanô.’

60\. And Vohûmanô spoke to him thus: ‘<i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! deposit this one garment which thou carriest, so that we _may_ confer with him _by_ <span id="p50"><sup><small>[ p. 50 ]</small></sup></span> whom thou art produced _and by_ whom I am produced, who is the most propitious of spirits, who is the most beneficent of existences, and who is he _that_ I, who am Vohûmanô, am testifying (that is, I am a reminder of him).’

61\. Thereupon, Zaratû<i>s</i>t thought thus: ‘Good is he who is the creator, who is better than this reminder.’ 62. Then they proceeded in company, Vohûmanô and Zaratû<i>s</i>t; Vohûmanô _first and_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t after.

[^7]: (38:1) Compare Zs. XVI, 5.

[^8]: (38:2) Possibly ‘supplementary’ or ‘gratuitous.’ The word is nîrmatŏ which, as a noun, means the gratuity or honorarium paid to a priest for acting as a substitute for another. Its etymology is obscure, unless it be an abbreviation of nirûmandî, ‘strength,’ used in the legal sense of ‘refresher.’

[^9]: (38:3) Compare Zs. XVI, 6.

[^10]: (39:1) The Yû<i>g</i>yâst is a distance of sixteen Roman miles of a thousand paces each (see Dk. VIII, xx, 19, note). But the writer of the scripture here quoted could have had no idea of the distance he was mentioning.

[^11]: (39:2) A sacred being who personifies ‘obedience,’ and is a special protector of man, particularly at night.

[^12]: (39:3) It may also be read dehîgân, ‘the country-folk.’

[^13]: (39:4) Or ‘_she_ would be.’

[^14]: (39:5) Or ‘they show _my_.’

[^15]: (39:6) This seems to be a bitter reproach addressed to her husband; but the ambiguity of the Pahlavi makes its exact meaning rather uncertain.

[^16]: (40:1) See Chap. II, 51. Compare Dk. V, ii, 4; Zs. XVI, 8-13.

[^17]: (40:2) The Pahlavi version of an Avesta text, here translated, is a fair specimen of the complication produced by appending a gloss to every epithet. It is useful as a combination of translation and lexicon, but it is apt to be perplexing, unless all the glosses are carefully omitted by the reader who can dispense with a lexicon. p. 41 For restoring the original Avesta, the Pahlavi translation, without the glosses, is usually the best guide.

[^18]: (41:1) Pahl. 4-ayû<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nô râê (Av. <i>k</i>athruyukhta and ratha).

[^19]: (41:2) This seems to be the meaning of Pahl. ‘zag-<i>î</i><i>k</i> tanŏ armê<i>s</i>tôdahi<i>s</i>nîh pavan fr<i>â</i><i>z</i> khadîtund margîh, amat pavan zerkhûni<i>s</i>nŏ, ba<i>r</i>â bekhûnd.’

[^20]: (41:3) Pahl. ‘Pôrûshâspô! aêghat bandakŏ?’

[^21]: (42:1) The first five words of § 28 are here inserted in the MS., so as to combine the two sentences in a perplexing manner.

[^22]: (42:2) The MS. has <i>a</i>fat for <i>a</i>fam by mistake.

[^23]: (42:3) Or ‘that.’

[^24]: (42:4) The differences of form in §§ 28-30 are probably due to errors of copyists.

[^25]: (43:1) Literally ‘demon-worshipping;’ it is not clear that idolatry is p. 44 intended, but rather some form of worship antecedent to Zoroastrian Mazda-worship which latter had not yet been established. The author of this legend must have supposed that it differed very little from the religion of Pôrûshâspô.

[^26]: (44:1) Reading sakhûn-i leyalmin which is written in Pahlavi exactly like dashinô rigel<i>â</i>, ‘the right foot.’

[^27]: (44:2) Pahl. marakŏ, possibly for marg, ‘death.’

[^28]: (44:3) See Chap. II, 51, note.

[^29]: (44:4) Probably referring to his companion Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh who, according p. 45 to most accounts, was the murderer of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in his old age. This tradition is mentioned in Dk. VII only here and in § 22.

[^30]: (45:1) Alluding to Dûrâsrôbô's own fate, see § 45.

[^31]: (46:1) See §§ 16 n.

[^32]: (46:2) Pahl. ‘avŏ pê<i>s</i> yema<i>l</i>e<i>l</i>ûnam.’

[^33]: (46:3) Or ‘in his back and broke it,’ if we suppose that pôst, ‘skin,’ stands for pô<i>s</i>t, ‘back.’ Compare the same legend in Zs. XIX, I-8.

[^34]: (46:4) With the sacred beings.

[^35]: (47:1) See Chap. II, 9 n.

[^36]: (47:2) The remaining contents of this and the following chapter are thus summarized in Dk. V III, xiv, 3, 4:—‘His attainment on maturity, at thirty years _of age_, to a conference _with_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and the occurrence of seven conferences in ten years. Many marvels, owing to him are published therein, just as there are _some_ which, collected _and_ selected, are noticed by the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> manuscript,’ that is, in this seventh book, in which, however, the details of the seven conferences do not occur; but some are mentioned in Zs. XXI, 8-XXIII, 13.

[^37]: (47:3) See Visp. XI, 2.

[^38]: (48:1) Literally ‘single-flowing.’ In Bd. XXIX, 4, 5, it is Nâîvtâk which has been translated as ‘navigable’ in Bd. XX, 34. and as ‘flowing in a channel’ in Dk. VIII, xxxvii, 38, 42; IX, xvi, 16.—From § 54 it appears to have been a channel of the good Dâîtî river which flows from Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> (see Bd. XX, 13).

[^39]: (49:1) See Pahl. Yas. XLII, 7 c (Sp.).

[^40]: (49:2) According to the numbering of the folios in the old Bombay MS., written in 1659, nine folios were here separated from it last century. They contained the text as far as the end of Chap. IV, and the first eight of them were found at Naosâri about twenty years ago and copied. But all Indian copies, written before that time, omit this mislaid text. See S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. xxxvi, xxxvii.
