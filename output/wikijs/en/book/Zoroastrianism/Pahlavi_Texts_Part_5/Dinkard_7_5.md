## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER V.

1\. About the marvellousness which is manifested from the acceptance of the religion _by_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp onwards till the departure (vîkh<i>ê</i><i>z</i>ŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _whose_ guardian spirit is reverenced, to the best existence, when seventy-seven years [^1] had elapsed onwards from _his_ birth, forty-seven onwards from <span id="p74"><sup><small>[ p. 74 ]</small></sup></span> _his_ conference, _and_ thirty-five years onwards from the acceptance of the religion _by_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^2].

2\. One _marvel_ is this _which is_ declared that, when Zaratû<i>s</i>t chanted revelation in the abode of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, _it was_ manifest _to_ the eye that it is danced to _with_ joyfulness, both by the cattle _and_ beasts of burden, and _by_ the spirit of the fires which _are_ in the abode. 3. By _which_, too, a great wonder is proclaimed, like this _which_ revelation mentions thus: ‘_There_ seemed a righteous joyfulness of all the cattle, beasts _of burden_, and fires of the place, _and there_ seemed a powerfulness of every kind of well-prepared spirits and of those quitting the abode (mân-hishânŏ), “that will make us [^3] henceforth powerful through religion,” when they fully heard those words which _were_ spoken by the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas.’

4\. And one _marvel_ is the provision, _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t, of the achievement _of_ ordeal, that indicator of the acquitted _and_ incriminated for sentence _by_ the judge, in obscure legal proceedings; _of_ which _it_ is said in revelation _there are_ about (<i>k</i>îgûn) thirty-three kinds. 5. These, too, the disciples of Zaratû<i>s</i>t kept in use, after that _time_, until the collapse of the monarchy of Irân; and the custom _of_ one of them is that of pouring melted metal on the breast, as in the achievement of the saintly (hû-fravar<i>d</i>ŏ) Âtûrpâ<i>d</i> son of Mâ<i>r</i>aspend, through whose preservation a knowledge <span id="p75"><sup><small>[ p. 75 ]</small></sup></span> about the religion _was_ diffused in the world; and of the manifestation, too, through that great wonder, this is also said, on the same subject, in the good religion, that of those many, when they behold that rite of ordeal, it convinces the wicked ones [^4].

6\. One _marvel_ is that which is afterwards manifested, after the former captivity of Zaratû<i>s</i>t [^5] and his speaking about the religion to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and those of the realm [^6], _such_ as the acceptance of the religion _by_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp _and_ that which Zaratû<i>s</i>t said to him at _his_ original arrival, as regards the declaration of a ruler's religion, thus: ‘Thine is this disposition, _and_ this religion which is calling (khrôsakŏ) is a property of that description _which_ thou puttest together, <i>O</i> Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp! so that _if_ thou wilt accept this disposition of thine, thou wilt possess this religion which exists (that is, the learning of learnings), _and be_ the ruler that shall cause _its_ progress; thou _wilt_ possess in this disposition of thine, as _it were_, a new support (stûnakŏ), _and_ any one will uphold _thee_ by upholding _it_, as thou art the possessor of the support of this religion.’ 7. Also the victory of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp over Ar<i>g</i>âsp the Khyôn and other foreigners in that awful battle [^7], just as Zaratû<i>s</i>t explained unto Vi<i>s</i>tâsp in revelation; _and_ much which is declared by revelation.

8\. One _marvel_ is the disclosure by Zaratû<i>s</i>t, in complete beneficence, medical knowledge, acquaintance with character, and other professional retentiveness (pîshakŏ-gîrûkîh), secretly _and_ completely, of _what_ is necessary for legal knowledge and spiritual <span id="p76"><sup><small>[ p. 76 ]</small></sup></span> perception; also the indication, by revelation, of the rites for driving out pestilence (s<i>ê</i><i>g</i>ŏ), overpowering the demon and witch, and disabling sorcery and witchcraft. 9. The curing _of_ disease, the counter-action of wolves _and_ noxious creatures, the liberating of rain, _and_ the confining of hail, spiders, locusts, and other terrors of corn _and_ plants _and_ adversaries of animals, _by_ the marvellous rites which are also relating to the worship of Khû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> _and_ Amû<i>r</i>da<i>d</i> [^8], and many other rites which _were_ kept in use until the collapse of the monarchy of Irân; and there are some which have remained even _till_ now [^9], _and_ are manifested with a trifle of marvellousness by the sacred fires. to. And the disclosure to mankind _of_ many running waters from marvellous streams (ardâyâ), and remedies for sickness which _are_ mixed (farga<i>r</i><i>d</i>akŏ) by well-considering physicians; many _are_ spiritual and celestial, gaseous (vâyîg) and earthy; and the worldly advantage of others, too, is the praise (l<i>â</i>fŏ) which ought to come to one for angelic [^10] wisdom.

11\. One is the marvel of the Avesta itself, which, according to all the best reports _of_ the world, is a compendium of all the supremest statements of wisdom.

12\. One _marvel_ is the coming of this also to <span id="p77"><sup><small>[ p. 77 ]</small></sup></span> Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, which the archangels announced as a recompense for accepting the religion [^11], as he saw Pêshyôtan the happy ruler, that immortal and undecaying son, not wanting food, large-bodied, completely strong, fully glorious, mighty, victorious, and resembling the sacred beings; the unique splendour of Pêshyôtan for the sovereignty of Kangd<i>e</i><i>z</i> _in_ yonder _world_, as allotted to him _by_ the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is manifested even through that great wonder to the multitude [^12].

## Footnotes

[^1]: (73:2) The MS. has ‘57 years,’ through ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_5/001.jpg) ‘50’ being written instead of ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_5/001.jpg) ‘70’; but see Chap. III, 51 which states the interval of thirty years between his birth and conference.

[^2]: (74:1) The contents of this chapter and the next, as far as VI, 11, may be connected with the following summary in Dk. VIII, xiv, 9:—‘Information also _as to_ many other things which are marvellous, and _as to_ a summary of the statements of these seven enquiries, which is _derived_ from knowledge of every kind.’ For the seven enquiries, see Zs. XXII.

[^3]: (74:2) Or, perhaps, ‘make the abode.’

[^4]: (75:1) §§ 4, 5 are already translated in AV. p. 145.

[^5]: (75:2) See Chap. IV, 67-69.

[^6]: (75:3) See Chap. IV, 73.

[^7]: (75:4) See Chap. IV, 88-90.

[^8]: (76:1) These two archangels personify health and immortality, respectively (see Chap. II, 19), and are supposed to have special charge of water and plants.

[^9]: (76:2) The ninth century, unless this phrase be copied from one of the sources of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>.

[^10]: (76:3) The MS. has yazdânŏ-khira<i>d</i>ŏîh which has the meaning given in the text; but this word can also be read gehânŏ-khira<i>d</i>ŏîh, ‘worldly wisdom,’ though gêhânŏ is the more usual orthography.

[^11]: (77:1) See Chap. IV, 81.

[^12]: (77:2) It is singular that nothing is stated here about the death or departure of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, which event, according to § 1, ought to have concluded this chapter. But in Chap. III, 39, Dûrâsrôb evidently foretells that Zaratû<i>s</i>t will be killed by the evil eye of Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh. In Dk. V, iii, 2, the killing of Zaratû<i>s</i>t by Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh the Tûr is merely mentioned. In Zs. XXIII, 9, it is stated that Zaratû<i>s</i>t passes away (vi<i>d</i>îrê<i>d</i>ŏ) forty-seven years after his conference and preaching to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp. While the modern Persian Zaratû<i>s</i>t-nâma does not mention his death, though it speaks of Bartarûsh as his chief enemy in his younger days. But compare Chap. III, 22.
