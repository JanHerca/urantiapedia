## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER X.

1\. About the marvellousness which is after the end of the millennium of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar and the arrival of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, until the end of the millennium of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh and the arrival of Sôshâns; _and_ as to tidings of the same period.

2\. The marvellousness of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh as to birth [^1], glory of person, sayings, and actions; the standing of the sun amid the sky twenty days long [^2]; and the increase of the milk of cattle arrives at a maximum (<i>a</i><i>v</i>artûm), _just_ as what it says, that _one_ milks only one mature cow (tô<i>r</i>â az) for a thousand men, _and_ that he brings as much milk as a thousand men _require;_ also the feebleness of <span id="p113"><sup><small>[ p. 113 ]</small></sup></span> hunger and thirst is _just_ as it says, that by only a single ration _one_ becomes satisfied _for_ three nights, _and_ whoever eats a leg _of_ mutton _has_ plenty for him_self_ _for_ three days _and_ nights. 3. The diminution of decay and extension (vêshîh) of life, the increase of humility and peace, _and_ the perfection _of_ liberality and enjoyment in the world.

4\. Like this which revelation states, that, when the first ten winters in the last millennium pass away, the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers then make enquiry together thus: ‘_Are_ we really more hairy-headed (sar-vars-<i>i</i><i>k</i>\-tar) than occurred before, owing to the well-yielding cattle, so that food and clothing are less necessary for us? Has affection come to us more completely, owing to those cattle, than it was ours before? _Have_ we grown up less deteriorated in the hair, by old age, than _those_ grown up before? _Are_ the thoughts, words, _and_ deeds of our women and children more instructed than they were before? 5. And _has_ this thing occurred, that he is classed as disqualified who in training a child has become quite retrogressive (pas-ûruzd), and is _his_ penalty arranged? Does the fiend think of the Karap class, and _are they_ utterly destroyed by her through those whose thoughts are most evil, devoid of righteousness, _and_ devoid of a liking for righteousness? 6. Near here, in the disturbance of the existences, does that happen as heard by us from the ancients, when listening _to_ the true proclaimers of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers? And now, even when our numbers _are_ so greatly maintaining this dispensation, do we sanctify (aharâyînem) righteousness (that is, do we perform duty and good works) more vociferously _and_ more strenuously?’ <span id="p114"><sup><small>[ p. 114 ]</small></sup></span> 7\. This, too, it says, even that no one passes away in the last millennium, other than those whom they smite with a scaffold weapon [^3], and _those_ who pass away from old age. 8. When fifty-three years of that millennium of his have remained, the sweetness and oiliness in milk _and_ vegetables are so completed that, on account of the freedom of mankind from wanting meat, they shall leave off the eating of meat, and their food becomes milk and vegetables. 9. When three years have remained, they shall leave off even the drinking of milk, and their food _and_ drink become water and vegetables.

10\. And in his millennium _are_ the breaking (lânakŏ) of the fetters of Dahâk [^4], the rousing of Kerêsâspô [^5] for the smiting of Dahâk, the arrival of Kai-Khûsrô [^6] and his companions for the assistance of Sôshâns in the production of the renovation _of the universe_, and the provision of most _of_ mankind with the Gâthic disposition and law; also the occurrence of many other wonders and marvels is manifest in that millennium of his.

11\. And this, too, it says, namely: ‘When that millennium _has_ fully elapsed, which is the second of the religion _of_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, what is the separation after the first century?’ 12. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘The sun conceals _itself_.’ 13. ‘And what is the separation after the second, <span id="p115"><sup><small>[ p. 115 ]</small></sup></span> third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth century?’ 14. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘The sun conceals _itself_.’

15\. And when thirty winters of the tenth century _are_ unelapsed, that maiden, who is Gôbâk-abû [^7], walks up to the water; she that is the mother of that testifying Sôshâns who is the guide to conveying away the opposition of the destroyer, and her former lineage is from Vôhû-rô<i>k</i>ô-î Frahânyân [^8] in the family of Îsa<i>d</i>vâstar, the son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _that_ is brought forth by Arang. 16. ‘That maiden whose title is All-overpowerer is thus all-overpowering, because through giving birth she brings forth him who over-powers all, both the affliction owing to demons, and also that owing to mankind [^9].’ 17. Then she sits in that water, when she is fifteen years old, _and_ it introduces _into_ the girl him ‘whose name is the Triumphant Benefiter, and _his_ title is the Body-maker; such a benefiter as benefits (savînê<i>d</i>ŏ) the whole embodied existence, and such a body-maker, alike possessing body and possessing life, as petitions about the disturbance of the embodied existences _and_ mankind [^10].’ 18. Not before that _has she_ associated with men; nor yet afterwards, when she becomes pregnant, _has she done so_ before the time when she gives birth [^11]. <span id="p116"><sup><small>[ p. 116 ]</small></sup></span> 19\. When that man becomes thirty years old, the sun stands still in the zenith of the sky _for_ the duration of thirty days _and_ nights, and it arrives again at that place where it _was_ appointed by allotment.

Also, as to the renovation _of the universe_ _and_ the future existence, _it_ is declared that they arise in his time.’
