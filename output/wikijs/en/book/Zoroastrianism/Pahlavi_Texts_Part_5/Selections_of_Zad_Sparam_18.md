## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1]. CHAPTER XVIII.

1\. About his diverse want of participation (gvî<i>d</i> akhvê<i>s</i>îh) with _his_ parents this also is declared, that the demons, at an assembly of wizards, produced an outcry _for_ a conference (ham-vâ<i>k</i>ô lâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) thus: ‘That son of Pôrûshaspô is senseless and foolish _and_ secretly corrupted; no one, man _or_ woman, _will_ consider _or_ accept _him_ as exalted.’

2\. The tidings came to Pôrûshaspô, and Pôrûshaspô spoke unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘I thought that I _had_ begotten a son who _would_ become a priest, a warrior, and a husbandman, and now thou <span id="p149"><sup><small>[ p. 149 ]</small></sup></span> wouldst be foolish and secretly corrupted; thou shouldst proceed to the Karaps, so that they may cure _thee_.’

3\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t gave answer thus: ‘I _am he_ that is thy son, a priest, warrior, and husbandman.’ 4. And, by command of Pôrûshaspô he harnessed two horses to a chariot (var<i>d</i>înŏ), and he went with Pôrûshaspô.

5\. When they came to the place according to the decision of Pôrûshaspô, into the presence of one Karap of those said five brethren, that wizard took a cup and made water, and spoke thus: ‘This he should drink who is a son of thine, so that he _may_ become well;’ and he acted with this conviction, that so he would change to the same nature as theirs.

6\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke to Pôrûshaspô thus: ‘Thou mayst give _it_ back to him who is thy protector _and_ high-priest;’ and he arose (âkhê<i>g</i>îd) [^1] and went back to _their_ place.

7\. On the way, Zaratû<i>s</i>t gave _their_ two horses water, on account of _their_ thirst; and he thought thus: ‘Unprofitable was my going to the residence of the Karaps, except _in_ this manner, when, through giving water to the horses, my soul _was_ then expanded.’
