## DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK V. CHAPTER I.

1\. The triumph of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, _and_ glory of complete wisdom, is the divine (ahûîg) religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship.

2\. The fifth _book_ is about the sayings of the saintly Âtû<i>r</i>\-farnbag [^1], son of Farukhzâ<i>d</i>, _who_ was the leader of the orthodox, even as to the manuscript which is called Gyêmarâ [^2]. 3. The collected replies of Âtû<i>r</i>\-farnbag, <span id="p120"><sup><small>[ p. 120 ]</small></sup></span> son of Farukhzâ<i>d</i>, the leader of the orthodox, about several significant questions that _are_ the wonder of the moderns, which _are_ like the friendly words, spoken by him _as to_ those of the ancient tribe [^3] (kâmon-ramân) who call _it_ really their Gyêmarâ, which _are_ obtaining [^4] a like wonder for them openly accessible to him [^5].

4\. About the unswerving _and_ co-operating chieftainship of those forefathers who went in mutually-friendly command of troops, _and_ the complete enclosure of that tribe within the military control of Bûkht-Narsîh [^6]. 5. About the disabling of vicious habits and evil deeds, which are entirely connected, and of the heinous demon-worship and mischief which <span id="p121"><sup><small>[ p. 121 ]</small></sup></span> are owing to them, through the ruler Kaî-Loharâsp [^7]t being sent, with Bûkht-Narsîh, from the country of Irân to Bêtâ-Makdis [^8] of Arûm, and _their_ remaining _in_ that quarter. 6. And the orthodox belief in the rude particulars _of_ religious custom in the mutual deliberation of those of the tribe, the acquaintance with religion of a boor (durû<i>s</i>takŏ-1), the difficult arrangements, and the enquirer doubtful of the religion after the many controversial, deliberative, and cause-investigating questions and answers adapted to the importunities of that wordy disciple [^9].

7\. About how the accepting of this religion _by_ the prophets before Zaratû<i>s</i>t _occurred_ [^10], how the pure _and_ saintly Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas came [^11], and who _will_ afterwards come as bringers of the same pure and good religion _here_after [^12]. 8. That is, of the prophets, apostles, and accepters of the religion, _there_ were _they_ who accepted _it_ concisely _and_ completely _such_ as Gâyômar<i>d</i> was, from whom _came_ irregularly (durû<i>s</i>takŏ) _such_ as Masyê and Sîyâmak, Hâôshâng, Tâkhmôrup, Yim, Frê<i>d</i>ûn, Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, the Sâmân, the Kayân, and also many other leaders in _those_ times [^13]. 9. And their acceptance expressly at various times is produced for action, and thereby the adversity of the creatures is removed, benefit <span id="p122"><sup><small>[ p. 122 ]</small></sup></span> and prosperity _are_ sought, the world is controlled, and the creator and good creations are propitiated.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (119:1) He was the leader of the orthodox about A<i>D</i>. 815-835, and held a religious disputation with the heretic Abâli<i>s</i> in the presence of the Khalîfah Al-Mâmûn (A. n. 813-833), as detailed in the Mâ<i>d</i>îgân-î Gu<i>g</i>astak Abâli<i>s</i>. He was also the first compiler of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, probably of its first two Books, which are not yet discovered, as well as of some of the materials for the other Books. (See S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, p. 411, n. 1.)

[^2]: (119:2) The name of this MS. can be only guessed. It occurs three times in each of the two MS. authorities, B and K43, and the simplest reading of five of these six occurrences would be Sîmrâ, so that the remaining one (Sarmâ) may be neglected as a corruption. A final â in Pahlavi is a very certain indication of a Semitic word, for if a final of similar form occurs in an Irânian word, it represents either h or kh; so if the name were Irânian, its most probable reading would be Sîmurkh. But, in § 3, it is intimated that the MS. belonged to an ancient tribe, or congregation (ram); it also seems, from Chap. IV, 8, 9, that the religion of this tribe was not so inconsistent with Zoroastrianism, as to prevent its members being taught that orthodox faith; and §§ 4, 5 of the present chapter appear to quote from that MS. some p. 120 particulars regarding the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. From these circumstances we may suspect that Âtû<i>r</i>\-farnbag, while collecting materials for his Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, had asked some Jewish friends what information their MSS. contained regarding the old Persians, as the two peoples had been in contact, more or less, ever since the time of the Achaemenian dynasty. If he did so enquire, the Jews would naturally search in the Talmud, in which references to the Persians still survive, though the text is no longer complete. The question is, therefore, whether the MS., whose name has been provisionally read Sîmrâ, can have had any connection with the Talmud. It will be at once evident to any Pahlavi student that Pahl. sî may be read gyê equally well, and that we have no better reason for reading Sîmrâ than for the Gyêmarâ, which has been put into the text, as a suggestion that Âtû<i>r</i>\-farnbag was really referring to the Gemarâ of the Jews, the supplement to their commentary upon Scripture. Whether this can be clearly proved remains to be seen, and positive evidence seems scanty.

[^3]: (120:1) Or ‘congregation.’

[^4]: (120:2) Or ‘including (van dig).’

[^5]: (120:3) Pahl. ‘mûn<i>s</i>ânŏ ham-shkûp-vindîg fr<i>â</i><i>z</i> aûbas yehamtûni<i>s</i>nîg.’ From which it appears as if there had been a mutual interchange of information between him and his Jewish friends.

[^6]: (120:4) The Pahlavi form of Bu‘<i>h</i>t-i-naʓar, or Nebuchadnezzar.

[^7]: (121:1) The father of Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp (see Bd. XXXI, 8, 29; XXXIV, 7). His expedition to Jerusalem is mentioned in Pahl. Mkh. XXVIII, 67, and by some Arab writers.

[^8]: (121:2) ‘The holy place,’ a title of Jerusalem.

[^9]: (121:3) Not identified. From this point to Chap. IV, 7, Âtû<i>r</i>\-farnbag must have used the same authorities as the writer of Dk. VII; but he returns to the Gyêmarâ in Chap. IV, 8.

[^10]: (121:4) Dk. VII, i, 7-40.

[^11]: (121:5) Ibid. 41.

[^12]: (121:6) Ibid. 42.

[^13]: (121:7) See the details in Dk. VII, i, 7-40. §§ 1-8 have been already translated in Grundriss der iranischen Philologie, ii. 93-94.
