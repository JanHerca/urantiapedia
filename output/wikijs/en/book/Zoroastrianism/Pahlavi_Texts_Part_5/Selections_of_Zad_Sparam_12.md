## SELECTIONS OF ZÂ<i>D</i>\-SPARAM [^1]. CHAPTER XII.

1\. About the coming of the religion at a _given_ time _being_ a resemblance such-like as the birth of a child through two united powers, which are the reception of semen _by_ females in procreation, and delivering _it_ back to the fathers, and a period of struggling and intermingling, especially by two means: a monarchy with [^2] religion of the same tenets (ham-vâ<i>k</i>\-dênôîh), and the existence of similar tenets to _those of_ the monarchy _in_ the custom _of_ the religion. 2. The religion _of_ the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, when the period of material <span id="p134"><sup><small>[ p. 134 ]</small></sup></span> organization is being converted again into a spiritual nature, became manifest on the earth, first through Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^1] _and_ afterwards through Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, like the reception of a child _by_ mothers _and_ delivering it back to the fathers.

3\. The manifestation of the religion through Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> was at that time when Frâsiyâ<i>v</i> [^2] kept back the water from the country of Irân, and brought the water again; in damsel form she was a speaker for _its_ manifestation, _in_ reply _to_ foreigners, at the house of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar [^3], the monarch of the country of Irân. 4. She _was_ also dressed, _and_ wore radiant clothing which shone out on all sides _for_ the length of a Hâsar [^4], which is _a distance_, like a Parasang; and, tied on her waist, she wore a golden _sacred_ girdle which was the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers itself.

5\. As to the belt of the religion, it is _that_ to which are connected the thirty-three fetters upon the thirty-three sins [^5], according to which all sin is divided; so that (kû) the damsels, by whom the tied sacred girdle of Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> _was_ seen, have become impetuous (taftîgŏ) after that for a tied girdle, on account of _its_ seeming beautiful.

6\. And this was the motherhood which is supplied through Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, as a gift, in the year 528 <span id="p135"><sup><small>[ p. 135 ]</small></sup></span> before Zaratû<i>s</i>t came out to _his_ conference [^1], which is _one of_ their statements from the annals of the religion _in_ a manuscript of the ancients.

7\. The name of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is also cited on the earth at 300 years before his conference [^2]. 8. For Irân, at the supplication even of the priests in the land, and for the sake of the pacification of a dispute arisen, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> produced a great ox, by whom the boundary of Irân next to Tûrân was intimated by pawing with _his_ hoofs, and he was kept in a jungle. 9. Whenever contention arose, the boundary was fully made known by that ox, until it was the wish of Kai-Ûs to take, fully covetously, a portion of the land of Tûrân back _into_ Irân, and he saw that the ox is _about_ to act very ill-naturedly, because it was not besought with _forms_ which were prescribed for it, where a boundary was. intimated by it [^3].

10\. _There_ were seven brothers, and he who was <span id="p136"><sup><small>[ p. 136 ]</small></sup></span> the seventh was called Srîtô [^1] the Seventh, the largest in body _and_ chief in strength, belonging to those instructed in many subjects for Kaî-Ûs, and he was among his princes. 11. Kaî-Ûs summoned _him_ into _his_ presence and ordered _him_ thus: ‘Go and kill that ox in the jungle!’

12\. Sritô went, _and_ the ox whom he wished to kill expostulated with him, in human words, thus: ‘Do not kill me! for though thou canst kill me, he whose guardian spirit is in the Hôm, the death-dispeller, _will_ also become manifest on the earth, _he_ whose name is Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas [^2], and _will_ proclaim thy bad action in the world. 13. And the distress in thy soul becomes such as is declared in revelation thus: "As it occurs to him, _so_ it _does to_ Va<i>d</i>ak [^3], when they mention his iniquity," and thy death becomes the like and, owing to death, it is mixed up with hers (that is, owing even to hers is the death of Srîtô).’

14\. When those words _were_ heard by him, Srîtô turned back, _and_ went again to Kaî-Ûs; also by his manner, and even apart from this, he stated [^4] what the ox _had_ spoken with awfulness, _and also_ thus: <span id="p137"><sup><small>[ p. 137 ]</small></sup></span> ‘I _am_ more desirous _than_ any one who is in the earth _created by_ righteousness, _that_ you _should_ now order destruction for the ox.’

15\. And Kaî-Ûs uttered _his_ will, with the conviction of superior wisdom, thus: ‘It is not certain whether he whose guardian spirit is in the Hôm,’ the death-dispeller, is himself, or not; and if he be, and be born [^1], _whether_ he _will_ become manifest, or not;' and he commanded with severity, thus: ‘Go and kill it! ’

16\. _And_ Srîtô spoke thus: ‘_It is_ not that I am without strength to kill, because _its_ reprieval by me _was_ owing to its remonstrance, mentioned to me, that a high-priest is to arise [^2].’

17\. So _it_ is declared thus, _in_ another revelation (dênô zagâî) [^3], when the Tûrânians _were_ backward _in_ heart, Kaî-Ûs spoke thus: ‘Go out to a certain jungle, in which dwell many chiefs of the witches, and they _will_ cut thee up without _any_ striving of heart.’

18\. And Srîtô went up to the jungle, _where_ many witches saw him, who kept their jaws open, and they _spoke_ about the handsome _man_ thus: ‘Slay _and_ do not spare!’ 19. And compassion _having_ gone out of his heart, he went back to the _other_ jungle and, with his fist, he broke the back of the ox in three places; and the ox, awfully convulsed (<i>s</i>kîftŏ barhamakŏ), kept _up_ an outcry.

20\. After the slaughter of the ox, owing to its convulsed state which _was_ heard by him, the <span id="p138"><sup><small>[ p. 138 ]</small></sup></span> remembrance of it then became grievous to Srîtô; and he went back to Kaî-Ûs, and informed him how it was, and begged him that he _should_ finish off by slaying him [^1], because his life was not desirable.

21\. Kai-Ûs spoke thus: ‘_Shall_ I slay thee, for it was not designed by thee?’

22\. _And_ Srîtô spoke thus: ‘If thou wilt not slay me, then I _shall_ slay thee.’

23\. _Again_ Kai-Ûs spoke thus: ‘Do not thou slay me, for I am the monarch of the world.’

24\. Srîtô continued _his_ discontent, until Kaî-Ûs ordered him thus: ‘Go out to a certain jungle; because a witch in the shape of a dog is in it, and she will slay thee.’

25\. _Then_ Srîtô went out to that jungle, and that witch in the shape of a dog _was_ seen by him; after he smote the witch, she became two; and he constantly smote them till they became a thousand, and the host (gir<i>d</i>ŏ) of _them_ slew Srîtô on the spot.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (133:1) Zâ<i>d</i>\-sparam was Dastûr of Sîrkân, about thirty parasangs south of Kirmân, in A.D. 881. At a later date, probably about A. D. 900, he compiled three series of Selections, from religious texts then extant, and these have been preserved by the Parsis in the same MSS. as contain the Dâ<i>d</i>istân-î Dînîk (see the Introduction). The first eleven chapters of this first series of Selections have been already translated in S.B.E., vol. v, pp. 155-186, as they refer to some of the subjects detailed in the Bundahi<i>s</i>. The remaining chapters are here translated, except the last which refers to the Nasks and Gâthas, and will be found in S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 401-405. The MS. authorities for the text are K35 and T (see [p. 2](/en/book/Zoroastrianism/Pahlavi_Texts_Part_5/Dinkard_7_Observations#p2) and Introduction).

[^2]: (133:2) T has ‘devoid of.’

[^1]: (134:1) The female archangel who has special charge of the earth and virtuous women (see Dk. VII, ii, 19 n).

[^2]: (134:2) See Dk. VII, i, 31; and regarding his irrigation canals, see Bd. XX, 17, 34; XXI, 6.

[^3]: (134:3) See Dk. VII, i, 29.

[^4]: (134:4) A thousand steps of the two feet, or Roman mile; see Bd. XXVI, r.

[^5]: (134:5) Thirty sins are detailed in Mkh. XXXVI, and thirty-three good works in XXXVII (see S.B.E., vol. xxiv, pp. 71-75).

[^1]: (135:1) If this coming to conference with the spirits be ‘the coming of the religion,’ in the thirtieth year of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp's reign, then, according to Bundahi<i>s</i> chronology, these 528 years will carry us back to twenty-eight years before the accession of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar. As any alteration in the date of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar's accession would disturb the millennial arrangement of Bd. XXXIV, it is probable that some copyist has miswritten the ciphers, and we ought to read 428. This legend appears not to occur elsewhere.

[^2]: (135:2) According to Bd. XXXIV, 7, Kaî-Ûs reigned from 360 to 210 years before ‘the coming of the religion.’ At this point a dislocation of the text occurs in all existing MSS., owing to the misplacement of a loose folio in some unknown copy written before 1530; the contents of this folio, §§ 8-16, are found in the existing MSS. three folios further on (after Chap. XIV, 14), and are here restored to their original position, as determined by the meaning of the text.

[^3]: (135:3) T has ‘by that ox.’ This legend is also told in Dk. VII. ii. 62-66.

[^1]: (136:1) Srîtô, the seventh son (compare Dk. VII, ii, 64), is not easy to identify. He could not have been Thrita the father of Keresâspa, because this Thrita the Sâmân is said to have been a third son in Pahl. Yas. IX, 30 (Sp.). He may have been Srîtô of the Vîsraps, whose soul visited Vi<i>s</i>tâsp in the latter part of his reign, about 350 years later, regarding which a legend is related in Dk. VII, vi, 2-11, and again mentioned in Dk. V, iii, 2; but there is a want of corresponding details for identification.

[^2]: (136:2) This is the citation of his name mentioned in § 7.

[^3]: (136:3) The mother of Dahâk, whose iniquity is considered as equal to that of the evil spirit, see Dd. LXXII, 5; Dk. IX, x, 3.

[^4]: (136:4) T has ‘also by his manner he intimated _and_ separately stated.’

[^1]: (137:1) T omits ‘and be born.’

[^2]: (137:2) The misplaced folio, which begins with § 8, ends here, but it is not quite certain that a few lines of text are not still missing.

[^3]: (137:3) T has ‘at another _time_ (bên zagâî).’

[^1]: (138:1) T has ‘that he _should_ command the slaying of him.’
