## MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM. DÎNKA<i>R</i><i>D</i>.—BOOK VII. CHAPTER IV.

1\. About the marvellousness which is manifested from the first conference onwards till the end of the seventh conference which occurred within the duration of ten years, also his pre-eminence in prophecy in the world, _and_ the acceptance of the religion _by_ the exalted Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, as _happened_ after the ten years of conference.

2\. In _the first_ two years, one _marvel_ is this which is declared, that when he was back from the first conference, he then, by the first command of the lord _and_ creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, recited the unique formula (âyînŏ) in an assemblage (ram) of Kîgs and Karaps, the prophecy of his Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion and commemoration of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as he chanted with a loud voice, and invited mankind to the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 3. Just as this _passage_ of revelation mentions thus: ‘Thereupon, the thorough inspection for this material existence of those with a _sacred_ girdle, provided with dwellings _and_ provided with cattle, _was_ altogether arranged by Zaratû<i>s</i>t.’

4\. And when their announcement (nivêdi<i>s</i>nŏ) for <span id="p51"><sup><small>[ p. 51 ]</small></sup></span> speaking to be heard _was_ issued [^1], then Zaratû<i>s</i>t, on becoming exalted, called out unto the embodied world of righteousness to extol righteousness and to scorn the demons [^2]. 5. ‘The homage of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ the ceremonial and obeisance for the archangels _are_ the best for you I assert and of deprecation (ay<i>a</i><i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîh) for the demons next-of-kin marriage is really the best intimation, so that, from the information which is given _as to_ the trustworthiness of a good work, the greatest are the most intimate of them, _those of_ father _and_ daughter, son _and_ she who bore _him_, and brother _and_ sister.’

6\. _It is_ declared that, upon those words, innumerable demon-worshipping Kîgs and Karaps have rushed upon Zaratû<i>s</i>t and strove for his death, just like this which revelation states:—‘It is then a number (mar) have run away who have sat in the vicinity of Tûr's progeny (hûnû<i>s</i>kŏ) [^3], the arbitrator: and the shame of the brother of Tûr arose, like _that of_ a person whose shame _was_ that they spoke of his next-of-kin marriage so that he might contract it.’

7\. This Tûr _was_ Aûrvâîtâ-dang [^4] the Tûr, the scanty giver, _who_ was like a great sovereign of that <span id="p52"><sup><small>[ p. 52 ]</small></sup></span> quarter; many troops and _much_ power _were_ also maintained by him, and the multitude (mar) told him they would seize the great _one_ from _him_ who is little.

8\. _But_ the progeny of Aûrvâîtâ-dang the Tûr, the scanty giver, _spoke_ thus: ‘_Should_ we for that _speech_ destroy him, this great _one_ who mingles together those propitious words _for_ us—where we are thus without doubt _as to_ one thing therein, _such_ as next-of-kin marriage, that it is not necessary to contract _it_—it would make us ever doubtful whether it _might_ be necessary to contract it.’

9\. And Aûrvâîtâ-dang the Tûr, the scanty giver, spoke thus: ‘Thou shalt not destroy that man whom mine eyes _have_ seen _as_ the most loving-eyed of the whole embodied existence; he _will_ attain strength, for it _has_ not seemed to me, when thou destroyest him on this account, _that_ wisdom _has_ arisen _for_ a long time; so that no rule (âhankŏ) _of_ wisdom _will_ arise, in this earth, which is so counselling (han<i>g</i>amanîg) as this _one_ is (that is, when they destroy a man who is counselling, wisdom _will_ not arise _for_ a long while).’

10\. Aûrvâîtâ-dang the Tûr, the scanty giver to his own _people_, also spoke thus: ‘For me thou art a pure _man_ who is counselling.’

11\. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘I _shall_ not always be that quiet speaker, by [^5] whom that I _have_ mentioned is the most propitious _thing_ to be obtained; and of interfering [^6] speaking and managing the temper _there_ is a next-of-kin marriage, and the high-priest <span id="p53"><sup><small>[ p. 53 ]</small></sup></span> _who has_ contracted [^7] _it_ is to perform the ceremonial.’

12\. And here the good spiritual lordship and mightiness of glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, those which are provided for commemoration _of_ the supreme lord and creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, are manifested _as_ a great wonder to the multitude, _and there_ is rendered visible the great pre-eminence which is in him _as_ a prophet _of_ the creatures, which for the baseness (nankîh) of the deceitful Agash [^8], the secret-moving and deceiving-natured, is the concealed control of a good disposition. 13. Then idleness, like even the habit of fear and nature of apostasy, is an attractor of every one of the multitude, when it extends to much length; little by little, too, that guide and combatant becomes a petitioner for greatness, _and it is_ manifest through that compassion (tang-libbem<i>â</i>îh) and superior mindfulness of his, _and_ through the glory of that stout champion, _there are_ much fame _and_ treasure.

14\. The nobles of Aûrvâîtâ-dang the Tûr, the ruler of the land, _were_ angry and clamourers for Zaratû<i>s</i>t's death; but he invited the Kîgs and Karaps to the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, just as this _passage_ of revelation states that Zaratû<i>s</i>t also spoke thus: ‘Worldly righteousness, <i>O</i> Aûrvâîtâ-dang, _thou_ Tûr _and_ scanty giver! is the whole _of the worship of_ the demons and the termination of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.’ 15. And Aûrvâîtâ-dang the Tûr, the scanty giver, spoke thus: ‘<i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! thou shalt not attract me to this evil in which thou really art.’ <span id="p54"><sup><small>[ p. 54 ]</small></sup></span> 16\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t also spoke thus: ‘Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> enquired of me thus: “<i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! when thou hast come away to us, among the spiritual lords, who of the people in thy material existence _was_ the protector of the powerful men who _are_ warriors, _that was_ most seeking benefit, most seeking cattle, most extensively associating, most fully-supplying (that is, he gives out most things), and most hospitable [^9] (_that is, one_ saw the door of a prince's (khidîvŏ) treasury)?” I replied to him thus: “Aûrvâîtâ-clang the Tûr, the scanty giver.”’

17\. ‘And he spoke _in_ reply to me thus: "Him, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! thou shalt attract, first of the men _who are_ warriors, to thinking about, speaking about, and acting about this religion which is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s and Zaratû<i>s</i>t's. 18. If you attract him, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! and he believes in it and also gives currency to this _religion_ of thine, and sits before _thee_ in discipleship, this that _one_ calls discipleship of thine he shall undertake, and the religion he hears fully he shall propagate (rûbâk va<i>b</i>îdûnyên); he is also ever after, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! the first of the men _who are_ warriors, the _one_ most seeking benefit, most seeking cattle, most extensively associating, and most hospitable of those who have yet been born _and_ who _will_ henceforth be born. 19. And if you do not attract him, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! and he does not believe in it, nor gives currency _to_ this _religion_ of thine, nor hears _it_, nor even sits before thee, nor would sit before thee, so that _it is_ obvious to me that _he_ is not attracted, thou shalt speak unto him thus, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t: ‘Thou art a stricken supplicant for righteousness, and a producer of lamentation for the souls of Tan<i>â</i>pûhar sinners <span id="p55"><sup><small>[ p. 55 ]</small></sup></span> worthy of death;’ for even so it is, and for this reason he becomes worthy of death, because the existence of the religion is known to him." 20. What I tell thee, <i>O</i> Aûrvâîtâ-dang, _thou_ Tûr _and_ scanty giver! is that thou art a stricken supplicant _for_ righteousness, a producer of lamentation for the souls of Tan<i>â</i>pûhar sinners worthy of death.’

21\. One prodigy of the demons is specified, who _was_ the enemy of whatever sacred beings _there are_, a Karap, Vaêdvôi<i>s</i>t [^10] _by_ name, _of_ those unsanctified (aya<i>s</i>tân) _by_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> [^11]. 22. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘I so befriend that man, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! who is put forward by me over the creatures, whom thou shalt invite (khvânê<i>s</i>), I _who_ am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, because I am through righteousness opposed to harm (that is, through virtue I keep harm away from the creatures), _and_ the archangels are opposed to harm. 23. Therefore do thou proceed, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! _and_ thou shalt demand from him for me (that is, keep as my property) a hundred. youths of vigour (tôsh tal) [^12], girls, and teams of four horses; so do thou speak to him thus: "<i>O</i> Vêdvoî<i>s</i>t! Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> demands from thee a hundred youths of vigour, girls, _and_ teams of four horses; if thou givest _them_  <span id="p56"><sup><small>[ p. 56 ]</small></sup></span> to him, splendour and glory are thine through that giving; and if thou dost not give to him, evil destiny is thine through that not-giving."’

24\. Then Zaratû<i>s</i>t walked on to that Vêdvoî<i>s</i>t of those unsanctified, and spoke to him thus: ‘<i>O</i> Vêdvoî<i>s</i>t of the unsanctified! that _which_ Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> demands from thee is a hundred youths of vigour, girls, and teams of four horses if thou givest them to him, splendour _and_ glory are thine through that giving; and if thou dost not give to him, evil destiny is thine through that not-giving.’ 25. And that Karap shouted in reply _to_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus ‘For me _there_ is no more from thee (that is, there is no opulence for me from thy action), nor from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; I am more of a divinity (bagtar) _and_ am more forward in opulence than even Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; many droves of a thousand swine are also acquired by me.’

26\. On went Zaratû<i>s</i>t, up to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> _and_ up to the archangels, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘<i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, propitious spirit, creator of the world of embodied _beings, thou_ righteous _one!_ thus spoke he in reply to me: "For me _there_ is no more from thee, nor from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; I am more of a divinity than thee or even Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and many droves of a thousand swine are acquired by me."’

27\. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘Owing to the splendour and glory of those which are ours, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! that man has acquired arrogance (that is, the cattle we produced are the many cattle of his arrogance). 28. This _will be_ his retribution for it then, however, when he does not reach further alive at the end of the third night [^13]; in that third night <span id="p57"><sup><small>[ p. 57 ]</small></sup></span> they _will_ have stood aloof from alongside his life (that is, they _will_ have stood away from assisting it); those seven of them who are radiant and bright-eyed (s<i>p</i>ê<i>d</i>ŏ dôîsar) make him rush up on high, and up there on high _he_ shall be fed upon mouldy bread (parnân).’

29\. One _marvel_ is the great healthfulness owing to the Hôm-water _and_ the bringing of this _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t from the river Dâîtî, which is manifested when Vohûmanô _was_ conveying _him_ to the conference. 30. Just as is declared in the words of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘For them is the Hôm-water which thou bringest, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! not for those demon-worshipping people _who_ worship the demons, or for a satisfier of courtezans (<i>g</i>êh-vi<i>g</i>âr); they shall sprinkle it on to that bull thou shalt bring forward, who is a four-year-old of exhausted vigour, black-haired and useful; _on_ drinking up the water, that bull _will_ become quite sound from that infirmity.’

31\. Thereupon, Zaratû<i>s</i>t went on first into the embodied existence, on which dwelt, at the end of Sagâstân [^14], that same Parsha<i>d</i> _whose_ title was Tô<i>r</i>â (_the Bull_). 32. Parsha<i>d</i>\-tô<i>r</i>â [^15] also spoke to him <span id="p58"><sup><small>[ p. 58 ]</small></sup></span> thus: ‘<i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! give me this Hôm-water which thou bringest.’ 13. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘Do thou praise righteousness, <i>O</i> Parsha<i>d</i>\-tô<i>r</i>â! and scorn the demons; _also_ utter the profession [^16] of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship of Zaratû<i>s</i>t among the iniquitous.’ 34. _It was_ praised by Parsha<i>d</i> tô<i>r</i>â, and the demons were scorned by him; yet he did not speak among the iniquitous as to his accepting the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 35. Forward to him _came_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t at that praise of righteousness, for him _was_ that Hôm-water which Zaratû<i>s</i>t brought; not for those demon-worshipping people _who_ have worshipped the demons, _but_ for that bull of his _which_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t brought forward, a four-year-old of exhausted vigour, black-haired and useful; owing to that bringing forward of the water, the bull became quite sound from that infirmity.

36\. One _marvel_ is that which is declared regarding the rushing of the evil spirit for the slaughter of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, just as revelation [^17] mentions thus: ‘From the northern quarter forth rushed the deadly evil spirit, and thus shouted he, astute in evil, the deadly evil spirit: "Rush on, <i>O</i> fiend! and destroy the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t." 17. On to him they rushed, the fiend, the demon Bû<i>d</i>, and secret-moving Pestilence, the deceiver. 38. Zaratû<i>s</i>t chanted aloud the Ahunavair; the fiend _was_ confounded at that, and away they rushed, the demon Bû<i>d</i> and secret-moving Pestilence, the deceiver. 39. And the fiends shouted thus: "Thou art scornfully observing, <i>O</i> evil spirit! (that is, anything to the purpose thou <span id="p59"><sup><small>[ p. 59 ]</small></sup></span> dost not thoroughly observe, and what thou orderest _us_ to do is not possible); the death of him who is Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas is not contemplated by us." 40. Owing to the full glory of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t, he perceived in _his_ mind thus: “The wicked demons, astute in evil, consult together about my death;” and up stood Zaratû<i>s</i>t, forth went Zaratû<i>s</i>t.’ 41. Here is manifested a great wonder to the multitude, in that which is mentioned thus: ‘And a stone _was_ put forth by the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _that_ was held in _his_ hand, and the size of a hut, _and_ which was obtained by him from the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the spiritual Yathâ-ahû-vairyô [^18].’

42\. And one _marvel_ is this which is manifested not only in the country of Irân to Irânians, but in every land and to every race: the shattering of the demons’ bodies _through_ the chanting of the Ahunavair aloud _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 43. Just as that which _a passage_ [^19] mentions thus: ‘I worship the resources of the Kayân glory, with which the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t was associated in thinking about, speaking about, _and_ acting about the religion which was, of all embodied existences, the most righteous in righteousness, the most lordly in sovereignty, the most radiant in radiance, and the most glorious in glory. 44. At _his_ appearance [^20] the demons have fallen before him, at _his_ appearance their semen (mâyagân) also drops, at _his_ appearance the courtezan is also withdrawn by them from mankind; <span id="p60"><sup><small>[ p. 60 ]</small></sup></span> on hearing [^21] him _they_ lamented, very violently is it lamented by the demons. 45. By the Ahunavair, which the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t chanted aloud to them, all the demons are seized _and_ buried in the earth, where the complete shattering of their bodies is manifest.’ 46. So that, after the shattering of their bodies, it became evident to those in the world _that_ they were not able to do mischief in the bodily form of a demon, and they have been declared of the nature of sacred beings to mankind, _but_ mankind fully understood that they are not sacred beings, but demons.

47\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t revealed (gushûftŏ) to mankind by the word of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, how in this religion _the latter_ tells in words to Zaratû<i>s</i>t where _and_ how, in the embodied existence, mankind consider a demon as exalted _or_ as a high-priest, because they are where they say that they must consider _some one_ as high-priest. 48. So Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke _to_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘How do they who are good people, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! consider a demon as exalted? and how are they that even tell a demon thus “We should accept you,” because the demons speak thus: “It _will_ happen to you”?’

49\. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘Only for the _reason_, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! _that_ people hasten on to that which is a jungly plain without dwellings, where no one resides from the departure of light until sunrise <span id="p61"><sup><small>[ p. 61 ]</small></sup></span> arrives, when _it is_ two Hâsars [^22] of night, and again silently (agôp) from sunset until their returning together when the two Hâsars of night are gone, they hear that no work, no men, and no voices of dogs are there. 50. Then they say as to that, on arriving back, thus: “We have consulted with the demons there; when we request (zâêm) monarchy (sâstârîh) _and_ leadership from them, they give them to us; when we request the possession of flocks and opulence from them, they give them to us.”’

51\. _Then Aûha<i>r</i>ma_zd _spoke thus:_ ‘How can they do such a thing for them, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! (that is, how does it happen _that it is_ continually given by them _for_ those that speak thus: “It happened to us”)?’

52\. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘They speak variously, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! as to that generosity; there is _one_ who speaks thus: “I have ever after been possessing more flocks, so long as I am _in_ consultation with the demons;” and there is _another_ who speaks thus: “I have ever after been worse and more ill-fated, so long as we are _in_ consultation with those demons;” according as they possess a full subsistence for them_selves_ from the demons (that is, when they diversely subsist fully _on_ whatever they bespeak from the demons).’ 53. Zaratû<i>s</i>t also spoke thus: ‘So they speak about it, <i>O</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! thus: “Observe further, where any one of us returns _he_ is either shrunk together (that is, he holds _his_ head down to _his_ chest), or shrunk away (that is, he looks quite aside), or is only pleasantly <span id="p62"><sup><small>[ p. 62 ]</small></sup></span> cast down and, owing to acquiescence in him, the demons tempt (nes,hûnd) _him_ away out of mankind.”’

54\. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: ‘According to thy wish, do thou, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! fully observe thy existence, upwards from the head, downwards from the sole [^23] of the foot, and afar _on_ various sides; and thou shouldst beseech before and behind and _in_ every direction, for we _are_ not as to thee as the demons _are_ as to mankind, we give away everything only in invisibility; but the demons, through close connection, when they rush out, tempt only with pleasantness. 55. Even unto thee, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! a fiend _will_ rush, a female, golden-bodied _and_ full-bosomed (so that she wears a bodice), and she rushes to request companionship from thee; a female, golden bodied _and_ full-bosomed, to request conversation from thee, to request co-operation from thee. 56. _But_ thou shouldst not grant her companionship, nor conversation, nor shalt thou prescribe _any_ conduct for her; afterwards, to revert her downwards, thou shalt utter aloud that triumphant saying the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô.’

57\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t proceeded to the habitable _and_ friendly world, for the purpose of fully observing that beaten track (kh<i>â</i>pisnŏ) of the embodied existence; then that fiend came forward when he sat in the vicinity of a garment—that garment [^24] which, when Vohûmanô _was_ conveying _him_ to the conference, _was_ deposited by him—a female, golden-bodied _and_ full-bosomed, and companionship, conversation, <span id="p63"><sup><small>[ p. 63 ]</small></sup></span> and co-operation _were_ requested by her from him; she also whined (dandî<i>d</i>ŏ): ‘I am Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> [^25].’

58\. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: ‘She who is Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> _was_ fully observed by me in the light of a cloudless day, and that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> appeared _to_ me fine behind and fine before and fine all round (that is, _in_ all positions she was handsome); do thou turn _thy_ back, _and_ I _shall_ know if thou art Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>.’

59\. And the fiend spoke to him thus: ‘O Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas! where we are, those who are females are handsome in front, _but_ frightfully hideous behind; _so_ do not make a demand for my back.’ 60. After she _had_ protested a third _time_, the fiend turned _her_ back, and she was seen by Zaratû<i>s</i>t behind in the groin; and when matter was exuded, _it was_ full of serpents, toads, lizards, centipedes, and frogs.

61\. And that triumphant saying, the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô, was uttered aloud by Zaratû<i>s</i>t; then that fiend _was_ annihilated, and <i>K</i>êshmak [^26] the Karap rushed forth. 62. And he grumbled in leaving, thus: ‘The misery which is here _below_ is such as I have obtained, because, owing to thee, I thought that thy sacred beings _were_ more joyful than any heroes who through defeat go to hell; I proceed more joyfully _than_ the sacred beings, as regards the life in the body, so that I fully deceive the life in thy body, and thou art fully deceived by me as regards thine.’ <span id="p64"><sup><small>[ p. 64 ]</small></sup></span> 63\. Zaratû<i>s</i>t also revealed (gushûftŏ) this secret to mankind, and their knowledge _how_ to test a demon is manifested therein, even by a great wonder of the same nature to mankind: the visible rushing of the demons into the world before Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ their bodies _being_ afterwards shattered by the loud chanting of revelation _by_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t from the Avesta announced, which _was_ the acceptance of _its_ truth by the ruler Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and the people of that time; and if this _had_ not been so, _and_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp _and_ those of _his_ time _were_ not accepting the Avesta which _was_ announced by _Zaratû<i>s</i>t in_ this fashion, through _their_ considering _it_ false, it would not have reached unto us.

64\. One _marvel_ is this, with which, too, he who _was_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t became aware from revelation, about the vileness _and_ perverted religion of Zâk of the deadly Karaps of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and many other Kaîs and Karaps who _were_ at the residence of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, their combination for the death of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the preparation for severe abuse of him to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, and influencing Vi<i>s</i>tâsp for his death by command of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, _which_ extends to awful imprisonment and punishment. 65. Afterwards, too, _his_ knowledge about his preservation therefrom, the manifestation of his wondrousness, and the evidence concerning _his_ attainment unto prophesying; _also_ after the continuance _of_ the last questioning of the ten years of conference, _his_ departure alone, by the advice _and_ command of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, to the residence of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and the precinct (var) of that terrible conflict. 66. _His_ uttering, on the horse-course (aspânvar) of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, a reminder of the power and triumph of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> over himself, _as_ he invited Vi<i>s</i>tâsp to <span id="p65"><sup><small>[ p. 65 ]</small></sup></span> the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and with great wisdom Vi<i>s</i>tâsp heard the words of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, on account of his own complete mindfulness and spiritual knowledge of ritual, _and_ would have asked for an outpouring of prophecy.

67\. _But_ thereupon, too—before the words of Zaratû<i>s</i>t _were fully_ heard by him, _and_ he could have understood the character of Zaratû<i>s</i>t—owing to the demonizing of the deadly Zâk and the rest _of_ those Kîgs _and_ Karaps, _spoken_ out with slanderous knowledge _and_ perverse actions to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp about Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _there_ then _occurred_ his consignment of Zaratû<i>s</i>t to that confinement _and_ punishment as stated in the words of Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: ‘I have spoken about their three enquiries, and I am bound by thirty of them, I with thirty-three fetters of murderers, wicked ones, and demon-worshippers [^27]. 68. But the hunger of manhood's inclination [^28] violently affected the strength of my legs, but the hunger of manhood's inclination violently affected the force of my arms, but the hunger of manhood's inclination violently affected the hearing of my ears, but the hunger of manhood's inclination violently affected the sight of my eyes, and it would force away my bosom up to _my_ back (so that it [^29] would stay behind at my back) through the continuance of that deadly hunger of manhood's inclination.’

69\. And here, through the mightiness of Zaratû<i>s</i>t—_who_ proceeded alone to the terrible combat _with_  <span id="p66"><sup><small>[ p. 66 ]</small></sup></span> evil, where _there_ became manifest, in the mode which is written, the descent of his life into so much punishment, due to hunger and thirst, heavy fetters, _and_ other misery unto which the strength of human nature is attaining, _but_ unto which _it_ is not destined—is manifested a great wonder to king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and his officials, when _his_ full-glorious person _was_ found by them alive in awfulness, imprisonment, and those other transformations (pa<i>d</i>gastakîh) of long-continued starvation.

70\. One _marvel_ is this, that the sacred beings contrived, for the sake of (va<i>l</i> vahân-î) his preservation from that awfulness, a body possessing life, _and_ on his account it became lifeless and imperceptible; afterwards, in the great session of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and the assembly of the world, Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through the strength and blessedness of the true word, restored the same body anew, like that which is issuing in the statement of the wonder about the splendid horse of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp [^30].

71\. One _marvel_ is _his_ telling and disclosing the thoughts of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and _of_ those of the realm, and many other concealed matters, through spiritual perception.

72\. One _marvel_ is several matters of evil deceit (va<i>d</i> <i>g</i>amâs) which Dahâk had done in Bâpêl [^31] <span id="p67"><sup><small>[ p. 67 ]</small></sup></span> through witchcraft, _and_ mankind had come to idol-worship through that seduction, _and its_ increase was the destruction of the world; _but_ through the triumphant words of the religion, which Zaratû<i>s</i>t proclaimed opposing it, that witchcraft is all dissipated and disabled.

73\. One _marvel_ is this which is manifested, with wonders owing to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, in controversy about the religion with the famous learned of the realm, among whom, known for learning in the world, _are_ the investigators (girâyagânŏ). of the words of speech; _and_ among those _things_ which _are_ more surprisingly controversial _are_ those later (sibastar) words which _are_ to save their creatures by a later religion. 74. Also to proclaim its truth intelligibly, and to make king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp _and_ those previously learned _men_ without doubt as to the truth of the religion, the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sends some _spirits_, Vohûmanô, Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô, and the propitious fire [^32], as a reminder to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp about the true prophesying of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, _and_ the desire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> for the acceptance of the religion _of_ Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship _by_ Vi<i>s</i>tâsp _and for its_ propagation in the world.

75\. The wondrousness which is manifested to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp _and_ those of the realm—both through the travelling (v<i>â</i><i>z</i>î<i>d</i>anŏ) of those archangels down from the sky to the earth, and in _their_ travelling to the abode of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp—_was_ like this which revelation mentions thus: ‘Then he who is the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke _to_ them, to Vohûmanô, Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô, and also the fire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the propitious, thus: “Proceed! you _who_ are archangels, unto the <span id="p68"><sup><small>[ p. 68 ]</small></sup></span> abode of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, whose resources (<i>a</i>fzâr) are cattle _and_ who is far _and_ widely famed, with a view to _his_ reliance upon this religion (that is, till he shall stand up for this religion); and, as regards the answering words of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas, to approve the nature (zag <i>s</i>ân) of those words.” 76. The archangels proceeded unto the abode of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, whose resources are cattle _and who_ is far _and_ widely famed; their radiance, in that lofty residence, seemed to him, that Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, a heaven _of_ complete light, owing to their great power and triumph; this _was_ so that, when he thus looked upon it, the exalted Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp trembled, all his courtiers (pê<i>s</i>akŏ) trembled, all his chieftains (pa<i>d</i>ŏ) were confused, _and_ he of the superior class _was_ like the driver of a chariot-horse.

77\. ‘And the fire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke, in the words of heroes, thus: “Fear not, for _there_ is no fearing for thee, _thou_ exalted Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp! they have not come for alarming thy abode, _as_ a reminder of the deputed envoys of Ar<i>g</i>âsp [^33]; _there_ have not come, for alarming thy abode, the two Khyôns of <span id="p69"><sup><small>[ p. 69 ]</small></sup></span> Ar<i>g</i>âsp who demand tribute and revenue (sâk vab<i>â</i><i>z</i>ŏ); and _there has_ not come, for alarming thy abode, the all-overpowering thief who is an injurer, _or_ the dog who is a highwayman. 78. We are three who have come over (taristŏ) to thy abode, Vohûmanô, Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô, and also the fire of the propitious lord; of these thy knowledge is most wisely most just. 79. If thou helpest vision, so that it becomes wisdom for thee, the worldly _existence_ requires the good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, which proceeds purely through the recitation which Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas _teaches_. 80. Do thou chant the Ahunavair, do thou praise perfect righteousness [^34], and utter no worship [^35] for the demons! because the desire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as regards thee, is _for thy_ reliance upon this religion; _it_ is also the desire of the archangels, and the desire, as regards thee, _of_ the other sacred beings who are beneficent (<i>s</i>apîrdahakŏ) _and_ righteous.’”

81\. ‘"And as the recompense in this life, if you praise the good _and_ pure religion of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas, we _will_ give unto thee a long reign and sovereignty, and the long lifetime of a life of 150 years; we _will_ give unto thee Good Integrity and Rectitude [^36] which is long-continued in desire for constantly assisting, good for assistance <span id="p70"><sup><small>[ p. 70 ]</small></sup></span> through constantly assisting, and not passing away; and we _will_ give unto thee a son, Pêshyôtan [^37] is _his_ name, he is immortal, _and_ so is undecaying, hungerless, and thirstless, living and predominant in both existences, _those_ of the embodied _beings_ and of the spirits. 82. _But_, as the recompense in this life, if you do not praise the good _and_ pure religion of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas, we _will_ not convey thee up on high, and we _will_ order thine end; the vultures which _are_ mindful of decay _will_ see _and_ eat up those and these of thine, thy blood _will_ reach the ground, and the waters _will_ not reach thy body."’

83\. One _marvel_ is that _connected_ with the confidence (v<i>â</i><i>v</i>arî-hastanŏ) of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp in the religion, even through that occurrence of the speech of the archangels; and, afterwards, the obedience (patyasâî?) of his thoughts in the case of the delays through the bloodshed owing to Ar<i>g</i>âsp [^38] the Khyôn and his attendant heroes (pas-gurdânŏ) through-out the same Khyôns, because of the acceptance of the religion. 84. Also, for the sake of daily _and_ visibly showing to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp the certified victory over Ar<i>g</i>âsp and the Khyôns, and his own superior position, unceasing rule, splendour, and glory, the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sends, at the same time, the angel Nêryôsang [^39] to the abode of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, as a reminder for the archangel Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô to give to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp to drink of that fountain of life, for looking <span id="p71"><sup><small>[ p. 71 ]</small></sup></span> into the existence of the spirits, the enlightening food by means of which great glory _and_ beauty _are_ seen by Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.

85\. Just as this _passage_ of revelation mentions thus: ‘And he who is the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to the angel Nêryôsang thus: “Proceed _and_ travel, <i>O</i> Nêryôsang the assembler [^40]! unto the abode of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, whose resources are cattle _and who_ is far _and_ widely famed, and thou shalt say this to Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô, thus: ‘<i>O</i> Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô! do thou authoritatively take this fine saucer (ta<i>s</i>tô), which is fully finer than the other saucers that _are_ made (that is, the cup (<i>g</i>âm) is as fine _as_ is possible to make for royalty), _and_ carry up to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp the Hôm and Vars [^41] (mûî) which are for us; and do thou give it [^42] unto the ruler Vi<i>s</i>tâsp to drink up, by whose word it is accepted.’” 86. Ashavahi<i>s</i>tô authoritatively taking the fine saucer from him, also, thereupon, gave it unto the exalted ruler Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp to drink _from_ [^43]; and the ruler of the country (dîh), the exalted Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, lay down when divested of his robes, and he spoke to Hûtôs [^44] thus: “You, <i>O</i> Hûtôs! are _she_ <span id="p72"><sup><small>[ p. 72 ]</small></sup></span> whom the prompt ability (t<i>ê</i><i>z</i>ŏ hûnar) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas should reach; _and_ through the diligence of the prompt ability of Zaratû<i>s</i>t of the Spîtâmas, you [^45] would expound the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Zaratû<i>s</i>t.”’

87\. One _marvel_ is this which is declared, that when Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, accepting the religion, praises righteousness, the demons in hell are disabled, and the demon Aeshm [^46] rushes to the country of the Khyôns _and to_ Ar<i>g</i>âsp, the deadly _one_ of the Khyôns, because he was the mightiest of the tyrants at that time; and the _most_ hideous of all, of so many of them in the country of the Khyôns, are poured out by him for war.

88\. And here, too, is manifested a great wonder also to the host (ram) of Irân who have been coming there, unto the residence of Ar<i>g</i>âsp the Khyôn, like this which revelation mentions thus: ‘Then, just at the time his legion is separately displayed, Aeshm the unredeemable (tan<i>â</i>pûharak) adheres (gêr<i>e</i><i>v</i>ê<i>d</i>ŏ) to him, as _being himself_ without escort (agurôh), and quite opposes (ba<i>r</i>â sper<i>e</i><i>z</i>ê<i>d</i>ŏ) him, because: “You, who are a Khyôn, _have_ become unlucky through want of success after you engage _in conflict_.”’ 89. Henceforth, it is not that the victory of Irân _has_ come over foreigners _and_ Khyôns-through companionship at the abode _of_ that man who is mightier by the birth _of_ Zaratû<i>s</i>t <span id="p73"><sup><small>[ p. 73 ]</small></sup></span> of the Spîtâmas—when that hideous sovereignty _of_ Ar<i>g</i>âsp, the deadly Khyôn, is swallowed up by him (_Vi<i>s</i>tâsp_), for the confusion of the deadly species (that is, _they are_ further smitten by him, one through the other; and are swallowed together by him, mutually struggling and through mutually devouring). 90. And apart from him, that bitter and well-hardened Khyôn that is quite disabled by him the good _Vi<i>s</i>tâsp_, that deadly _fiend_ is disturbed about him of eloquent abilities (_Zaratû<i>s</i>t_); and so he grumbled at the hideous sovereignty thus: ‘Prompt ability comes into existence _and_ the Khyôn came; thereupon prompt ability comes into existence _and_ the Irânian has come [^47].’

## Footnotes

[^1]: (51:1) From this point §§ 4-8 and 11 have been already translated in S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 412, 413, in illustration of the meaning of Khvêtûk-das in Sasanian times and later.

[^2]: (51:2) Av. staomî ashem; nâismî daêvô (Yas. XI, 19; XII, r).

[^3]: (51:3) An opprobrious term for the progeny of evil beings and animals, also used by a Karap when speaking of Zaratû<i>s</i>t in Chap. III, 21.

[^4]: (51:4) As this name has not been found in the extant Avesta, its correct reading is uncertain. In Zs. XX, 8, it can be read Aûrvaîtŏ-dih, in which dih is the Pahl. translation of Av. dang,hu, of which dang is a Pahl. transliteration; and the whole name may mean ‘friendly to the province,’ which seems suitable to this particular ruler. The MS. appears to have dêng.

[^5]: (52:1) Or ‘from.’

[^6]: (52:2) It may be ‘parenthetical or ambiguous.’

[^7]: (53:1) Or, perhaps, ‘celebrated.’

[^8]: (53:2) The demon of the evil eye (see Bd. XXVIII, 33); Av. Aghashi, Vd. XX, 3, 7, 9.

[^9]: (54:1) Literally ‘most many-doored.’

[^10]: (55:1) Here written in Pâzand, but the Pahlavi form, Vêdvoî<i>s</i>t, occurs in §§ 23, 24.

[^11]: (55:2) Or ‘of the non-worshippers of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.’

[^12]: (55:3) For an instance of gifts of slaves see the Pahlavi inscription on an engraved stone from Baghdâd, in _Indian Antiquary_, vol. xi, p. 224, ll. 2, 3 of inscription: ‘kevan bîdûn va-kanî<i>g</i>akŏ . . . lakhvâr . . . shed<i>r</i>ûnam . . . va-zak shibâ rî<i>d</i>ŏ va-shibâ kanî<i>g</i>akŏân shed<i>r</i>ûnt:’—‘Now . . . I send back a slave-boy and slave-girl . . . and those seven slave-boys and seven slave-girls are sent.’ This inscription was probably engraved in the seventh century, judging from the forms of the letters.

[^13]: (56:1) Apparently the third night after death, on the passing away of p. 57 which the soul is supposed to have its destination determined, until the resurrection (see Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask, II, 18; III, 17). If the seven sacred beings who stand aloof from him be the archangels, they treat Vêdvoî<i>s</i>t very leniently; but this legend treats of a period which it assumes to be earlier than the laws of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.

[^14]: (57:1) The modern Sîstân, bordering upon Afghânistân and Bulû<i>k</i>istân.

[^15]: (57:2) Av. Parsha<i>d</i>\-g<i>a</i>u, mentioned twice in Yt. XIII, 96, 127, but it is not certain that both allusions refer to the same individual. The name also occurs in Bd. XXIX, 5, but only hi one old MS.; in all others another name is given, though the locality appears to be p. 58 nearly the same. In § 31 the first part of the name is here written Parshê<i>d</i>.

[^16]: (58:1) The Fravarânê, Yas. XI, 16.

[^17]: (58:2) Pahl. Vd. XIX, 1-4.

[^18]: (59:1) The first three words of the Ahunavair formula.

[^19]: (59:2) See Yt. XIX, 78-81.

[^20]: (59:3) Reading vênd<i>â</i>vdahakih, but the first letter is omitted in all three occurrences of the word.

[^21]: (60:1) If the word be Pahlavi, it is probably intended for <i>s</i>nâyân, hearing'; but it may be merely an approximate transcript of Av. snaodhe<i>n</i>ti<i>s</i>, which word, if this be the case, must have puzzled Sasanian scholars as much as it does those of the present time. As a transcript, the word might be read snôdîyân, and we might guess the meaning of the phrase to be ‘thereupon weeping _they_ lamented.’

[^22]: (61:1) Av. hâthra, which, as a measure of time, varies from one to two hours (see Farh. Um, p. 43, ll. 1-3).

[^23]: (62:1) Assuming that lêlyâ stands for zêrîh; the only difference, in Pahlavi writing, being in the first letter.

[^24]: (62:2) See Chap, III, 60.

[^25]: (63:1) The female archangel Bountiful Devotion, in whose special charge are the earth and virtuous women; see Sls. XV, 5, 20-24.

[^26]: (63:2) See Chap. II, 44, 45.

[^27]: (65:1) Compare Zs. XXIII, 5.

[^28]: (65:2) Reading gû<i>s</i>n-girâîh; but it might be dû<i>s</i>\-vîrâîh, ‘bad provision.’ He was left to starve to death in prison.

[^29]: (65:3) The bosom. The idea of the writer appears to have been that in case of utter starvation the chest would totally collapse, so that the breast bone would touch the spine.

[^30]: (66:1) This very slight allusion to the cure of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp's horse by Zaratû<i>s</i>t is sufficient to show that this legend existed in the ninth century; but the writer of the Dînka<i>r</i><i>d</i> seems inclined to trace it back to a tale that he vaguely relates in the earlier part of this section, and which he evidently found in older writings; this tale, however, does not mention a horse, but only an animated body. The Persian Zaratû<i>s</i>t-nâma [develops](errata_htm.html) the legend of the sick horse, whose legs are drawn up to its belly, into 160 couplets.

[^31]: (66:2) Babylon; see Yt. V, 29-31; XV, 19-21.

[^32]: (67:1) Compare Zs. XXIII, 7.

[^33]: (68:1) Av. Are<i>g</i>a<i>d</i>\-aspa, king of the <i>H</i><i>v</i>yaonas (Pahl. Khyôns), mentioned in Yt. V, 109, 113, 116; XVII, 50; XIX, 87. His war with Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, for the purpose of compelling the latter to abjure his new religion, is described in the Yâ<i>d</i>kâr-î Zarîrân (see Geiger in _Sitzungsberichten der p.-p. and h. Classe der k. bayer. Akad. der Wiss_. 1890, Bd. II, pp. 43-84). Ar<i>g</i>âsp sends two envoys, Vîdraf<i>s</i> the wizard and Nâmkhvâst of the Hazârs, to demand Vi<i>s</i>tâsp's submission; this is refused defiantly by advice of Zarîr, the king's brother; and both nations prepare for war. When the Irânians meet the Khyôns, Vi<i>s</i>tâsp consults his vazîr <i>G</i>âmâsp, who prognosticates prodigious slaughter. And, after losing most of their chieftains (including twenty-three brothers and sons of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp), the Irânians utterly annihilate the Khyôn army. This war is called the ‘war of the religion’ in Bd. XII, 33; Byt. III, 9.

[^34]: (69:1) That is, recite the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô and the Ashem-vohû formulas.

[^35]: (69:2) Pahl. a-a<i>î</i><i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîh, literally, a ‘non-worship,’ which may mean something worse than ‘no worship;’ but ‘execration or malediction’ is usually expressed by ga<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n, ‘cursing,’ which is written exactly like ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n, ‘worship.’

[^36]: (69:3) Pahl. Aharî<i>s</i>vang and Râ<i>ê</i>\-asti<i>s</i>nîh, the equivalents of Av. Ashi<i>s</i>\-vanguhi and Rasãstât who are spiritual personifications of the qualities mentioned in the text.

[^37]: (70:1) Written Pêshyâôtanŏ, both here and in Chap. V, 12. He is the immortal priestly ruler of Kangd<i>e</i><i>z</i>, who was expected to come to restore the religion in Iran in the time of Aûshê<i>d</i>ar, see Bd. XXIX, 5; Byt. III, 25-32, 36-42, 51, 52.

[^38]: (70:2) Here written Ar<i>g</i>adâspô; see § 77.

[^39]: (70:3) Written Nêryôsang here and in § 85.

[^40]: (71:1) Compare Vd. XXII, 7.

[^41]: (71:2) A lock of three, five, or seven hairs from the tail of a white bull, that is tied to a metal thumb-ring which is put into the Hôm-strainer when the Hôm-juice is about to be poured through it. See Haug's Essays, 3rd ed., pp. 397-403. This ring and lock of hair may be the relic of a hair-sieve that may have been used for straining the Hôm-juice in former times.

[^42]: (71:3) The saucer, or cup, of strained Hôm-juice.

[^43]: (71:4) The foregoing twenty-six words, excepting two, have been here repeated by the writer of the old Bombay MS., after turning over a folio.

[^44]: (71:5) Av. Hutaosa, wife of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and descendant of Nô<i>d</i>ar (Av. Naotara); see Yt. XV, 35, 36. According to the later authority of the Yâ<i>d</i>kar-î Zarîrân, § 48, she was also a sister or Vi<i>s</i>tâsp. p. 72 The similarity of her name to that of Atossa, the wife and sister of Cambyses, whom Darius afterwards married, is striking.

[^45]: (72:1) As the verbal forms of the present third person singular and second person plural are alike in Pahlavi, it is doubtful which personal pronoun to use.

[^46]: (72:2) The demon of Wrath; see Bd. XXVIII, 15-17.

[^47]: (73:1) According to the numbering of the folios of the old MS. of 1659 (brought from Persia to India in 1783) one folio, numbered 313 in Persian words, is here missing. It has not yet been found in India, and, owing to folio 312 apparently completing a sentence, and folio 314 evidently beginning a new chapter, the loss of text is hardly perceptible. It would have filled the next two pages.
