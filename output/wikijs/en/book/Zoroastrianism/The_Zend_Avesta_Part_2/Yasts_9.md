Gô<i>s</i>, ‘the cow,’ κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν, is a personation of the animal kingdom which she maintains and protects. She is also called Drvâspa and Go<i>s</i>ûrûn: Drvâspa means ‘she who keeps horses in health,’ and is nothing more than an epithet of Gô<i>s</i>: Gô<i>s</i>ûrûn (from the Zend G<i>e</i>u<i>s</i> urvan) means ‘the Soul of the Bull’ (the primeval Bull). Although urvan is a masculine noun in Zend, yet Gô<i>s</i>ûrûn is considered a female angel, as this name is only a substitute for Gô<i>s</i>.

Gô<i>s</i> is the angel of the 14th day (Sîrôzah I, 14), and her Ya<i>s</i>t is recited during the Gâh U<i>s</i>ahin, on the days of Gô<i>s</i>, Bahman, Mâh, and Râm (the same days as those on which the Mâh Ya<i>s</i>t is recited; see above, [p. 88](../Yasts_7#p88)).

Gô<i>s</i> is hardly described in this Ya<i>s</i>t (§§ 1-2); the greater part of it being filled with the several prayers addressed to her by the Iranian heroes, Haoshyangha (§ 3), Yima (§ 8), Thraêtaona (§ 13), Haoma (§ 17), Husravah (§ 21), Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, and Vî<i>s</i>tâspa. Her worshippers and their prayers to her are the same as in the case of Ashi Vanguhi (see Yt. XVII).

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! May Angra Mainyu be afflicted! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, one who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, satisfaction, and glorification unto Hâvani, the holy and master of holiness.

Unto the powerful Drvâspa, made by Mazda and holy [^529],

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness. . . .

For her brightness and glory, I will offer her a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

14\. ‘Grant me this boon, O good, most beneficent Drvâspa! that I may overcome A<i>z</i>i Dahâka, the three-mouthed, the three-headed, the six-eyed, who has a thousand senses, that most powerful, fiendish Dru<i>g</i>, that demon, baleful to the world, the strongest Dru<i>g</i> that Angra Mainyu created against the material world, to destroy the world of the good principle; and that I may deliver his two wives, Savanghavâ<i>k</i> and Erenavâ<i>k</i>, who are the fairest of body amongst women, and the most wonderful creatures in the world [^538].’

15\. The powerful Drvâspa, made by Mazda, the holy Drvâspa, the maintainer, granted him that boon, as he was offering up libations, giving gifts, sacrificing, and entreating that she would grant him that boon.

For her brightness and glory, I will offer her a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

22\. ‘Grant me this boon, O good, most beneficent Drvâspa! that I may kill the Turanian murderer, Franghrasyan, behind the <i>K</i>aê<i>k</i>asta lake, the deep lake of salt waters, to avenge the murder of my father Syâvarshâna, a man, and of Aghraêratha, a semi-man [^547].’

[^540]: 114:2 Cf. Yasna XI, 7 \[20-21\]. The destruction of the fiends, being one of the principal effects of sacrifice, is ascribed to Haoma as the most powerful element in the sacrifice. In the Shâh Nâmah, the god Haoma has been turned into a hermit who, living near the cave in which Afrâsyâb had taken refuge (see above, Yt. V, 41), overhears his lamentations, takes him by surprise, binds him, and delivers him into the hands of Khosrav (Études Iraniennes, II, 227).

[^541]: 114:3 See [p. 64](../Yasts_5#p64), note [1](../Yasts_5#fn315).

[^545]: 114:7 Doubtful (narava, as opposed to nara). Aghraêratha (Aghrêrath) was a brother of Afrâsyâb's; he was a righteous man, and Afrâsyâb killed him for his having saved the Iranian king Mino<i>k</i>ihr with his army, when captive in the Padashkhvâr mountains (Bundahi<i>s</i> XXXI, 21). Yet he is still living as an immortal in the land of Saukavastân, under the name of Gôpatshâh (the king of the bulls); ‘from foot to mid-body he is a bull, and from mid-body to p. 115 the top he is a man; at all times he stays on the sea-shore, and always performs the worship of God, and always pours holy-water into the sea’ (Minokhired LXII, 31 seq., tr. West; Bund. XXIX, 5); according to Bund. XXXI, 20, Aghrêrath was not Gôpatshâh, he was his father. Cf. Yt. XIX, 93.

[^553]: 117:4 Ἅπαξ λεγόμενος.

[^554]: 117:5 Mentioned Yt. V, 109 and XIX, 87.

[^555]: 117:6 The <i>H</i><i>v</i>yaonas seem to have been the Chionitae, a bellicose tribe, near the land of Gilan, often at war with the first Sassanides (Amm. Marcellinus XVII, 5). The name of the Varedhakas reminds one of the Vertae who are mentioned once in company with the Chionitae (ibid. XIX, 1); but their geographical situation is not ascertained. In any case the proximity of the Dâitya (§ 29) shows that both people must have inhabited the western coast of the Caspian sea.
