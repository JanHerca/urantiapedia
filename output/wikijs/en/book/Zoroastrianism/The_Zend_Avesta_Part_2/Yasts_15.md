This Ya<i>s</i>t bears the name of Râma <i>H</i><i>v</i>âstra, the Genius who presides over the 21st day of the month (Sîrôzah, § 21), and is devoted to his Hamkâr, Vayu.

Regarding Râma <i>H</i><i>v</i>âstra, the Genius that gives good abodes and good pastures, and his connection with Vayu, see Vend. Introd. IV, and Études Iraniennes, II, 187.

This Ya<i>s</i>t can be divided into two parts. The first part (§§ 1-140) contains an enumeration of worshippers who sacrificed to Vayu: Ahura Mazda (§ 2), Haoshyangha (§ 7), Takhma Urupa (§ 11), Yima (§ 15), A<i>z</i>i Dahâka (§ 19), Thraêtaona (§ 23), Keresâspa (§ 27), Aurvasâra (§ 31), Hutaosa (§ 35), and Iranian maids (§ 39). The second part (§§ 42-58) contains a special enumeration and glorification of the many names of Vayu (§§ 42-50).

[^1164]: 250:5 As Vayu, the atmosphere, is the place in which the conflict of the two principles takes place, one part of him belongs to the Evil Spirit (see Vend. Introd. IV, 17).

[^1165]: 251:1 The rest as in clause 1.

[^1166]: 251:2 Cf. Yt. V, 21, [p. 58](Yasts_5#p58), note [2](Yasts_5#fn295).

[^1167]: 251:3 Cf. Yt. V, 21-23.

[^1168]: 251:4 Introduced from § 4 into this and all similar clauses, except the one relating to A<i>z</i>i Dahâka (§ 21).

[^1169]: 252:1 Takhma Urupa (in later legend Tahmûrâf) was a brother to Yima. He reigned for thirty years and rode Ahriman, turned into a horse. But at last his wife, deceived by Ahriman, revealed to him the secret of her husband's power, and Tahmûrâf was swallowed up by his horse. But Yima managed to take back his brother's body from the body of Ahriman and recovered thereby the arts and civilisation which had disappeared along with Tahmûrâf (see Minokhired XXVII, 32; Ravâet apud Spiegel, Einleitung in die traditionelle Literatur, pp. 317 seq.; Ormazd et Ahriman, § 137 seq.; cf. above, [p. 60](Yasts_5#p60), note [1](Yasts_5#fn302)).

[^1170]: 252:2 Azinava<i>n</i><i>t</i> or zaênahva<i>n</i><i>t</i>: he kept that epithet in later tradition: Zînavend, ‘quod cognomen virum significat armis probe instructum’ (Hamza Ispahensis, p. 20, tr. Gottwaldt).

[^1171]: 252:3 As told Yt. XIX, 29.

[^1172]: 253:1 Cf. Yasna IX, 4-5 (11-20) and Yt. XIX, 31 seq.

[^1173]: 253:2 This passage is interpolated from Yasna IX, 5 (17-10.

[^1174]: 253:3 Or, ‘his accursed palace of the Stork’ (upa kviri<i>n</i>tem duzitem). ‘A<i>z</i>i Dahâka,’ says Hamza (p. 32 in the text, p. 22 in the translation), ‘used to live in Babylon (cf. Yt. V, 29), where he had built a palace in the form of a stork; he called it Kuleng Dîs ( ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/25300.jpg)), the fortress of the Stork; the inhabitants called it Dis Het ( ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/25301.jpg)).’ Kuleng Dîs was in Zend Kviri<i>n</i>ta daêza and Dis Het is nothing else than Du<i>z</i>ita. One may doubt p. 254 whether Kviri<i>n</i>ta is the name of a place or the Zend form of Kuleng, a stork: in any case it was a palace in Bawri (Babylon). In the Shah Nâmah it is called Di<i>z</i>ukht (du<i>z</i>\-ukhta for du<i>z</i>\-ita; see Études Iraniennes, II, 211).

[^1175]: 254:1 Cf. Yt. V, 30 seq.

[^1176]: 255:1 Yt. V, 34; IX, 14; XVII, 34.

[^1177]: 255:2 Cf. Yt. V, 37 seq.

[^1178]: 255:3 An unknown affluent of the Rangha (Tigris).

[^1179]: 255:4 Sâma had two sons, Keresâspa, a warrior, and Urvâkhshaya, a judge and law-giver (Yasna IX, 10 \[29 seq.\]). We have no further details about Urvâkhshaya's legend than that he was killed by ‘Hitâspa, the golden-crowned’ (cf. Yt. XIX, 4I), and avenged by Keresâspa.

[^1180]: 256:1 A disconnected allusion to the struggle of Keresâspa with the Ga<i>n</i>darewa (Yt. V, 38, text and notes; XIX, 41). On the words ‘the son of Ahura . . . .’ cf. Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 215, note 1.

[^1181]: 256:2 No other mention is made of Aurvasâra in the Avesta, unless he is alluded to in Yt. V, 50. He does not appear to have been. known to Firdausi.

[^1182]: 256:3 Spaêtini<i>s</i> razûra is called ‘the chief of forests’ (Bund. XXIV, 16). According to the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t (III, 9), it was the seat of the last and decisive battle between Ar<i>g</i>âsp and Gû<i>s</i>tâsp.

[^1183]: 256:4 Cf. Yt. V, 49; IX, 21.

[^1184]: 256:5 Cf. Yt. V, 50.

[^1185]: 257:1 This line looks as if it should belong to a counter-prayer by Husravah, which was heard by Vayu, as appears from Yt. V, 50.
