Regarding Bahrâm (Verethraghna), the Genius of Victory, see Vend. Introd. V, 8.

This Ya<i>s</i>t can be divided into four parts:—

I (§§ 1-28). An enumeration of the ten incarnations in which Verethraghna appeared to Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (as a wind, § 2; as a bull, § 7; as a horse, § 9; as a camel, § 11; as a boar, § 15; as a youth, § 17; as a raven, § 19; as a ram, § 23; as a buck, § 25; and as a man, § 27).

II (§§ 30-33). The powers given by Verethraghna to his worshipper, Zarathu<i>s</i>tra.

III (§§ 34-46). The magical powers, ascribed to the raven's feather, of striking terror into an army and dispersing it (the raven being the seventh incarnation of Verethraghna).

IV (§§ 47-64). The glorification of Verethraghna.

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, one who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\], the holy and master of holiness . . . .

Unto Verethraghna, made by Mazda, and unto the crushing Ascendant [^1035];

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

## I.

1\. We sacrifice unto Verethraghna, made by Ahura.

Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!

<span id="p232"><sup><small>[ p. 232 ]</small></sup></span>

‘Who is the best-armed of the heavenly gods?’

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is Verethraghna, made by Ahura, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!’

2\. Verethraghna, made by Ahura, came to him first, running in the shape of a strong, beautiful wind, made by Mazda; he bore the good Glory, made by Mazda, the Glory made by Mazda, that is both health and strength.

3\. Then he, who is the strongest [^1036], said unto him [^1037]: 'I am the strongest in strength; I am the most victorious in victory; I am the most glorious in Glory; I am the most favouring in favour; I am the best giver of welfare; I am the best-healing in health-giving.

4\. 'And I shall destroy the malice of all the malicious, the malice of Daêvas and men, of the Yâtus and Pairikas, of the oppressors, the blind, and the deaf.

5\. 'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard; namely, unto Verethraghna, made by Ahura. We worship Verethraghna, made by Ahura, with an offering of libations, according to the primitive ordinances of Ahura; with the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the tongue, the holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations, and the rightly-spoken words.

‘Yê<i>n</i>hê hâtãm: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda. . . .

Then he, who is the strongest, said unto him: 'I am the strongest in strength . . . [^1038]

12\. Who of all males in rut shows greatest strength and greatest fire, when he goes to his females. Of all females those are best kept whom a burden-bearing camel keeps, who has thick forelegs and large humps, . . . . [^1045], quick-eyed, long-headed, bright, tall, and strong;

13\. Whose piercing look goes afar . . . . [^1046], even in the dark of the night; who throws white foam <span id="p235"><sup><small>[ p. 235 ]</small></sup></span> along his mouth; well-kneed, well-footed, standing with the countenance of an all-powerful master:

20\. He alone of living things,—he or none,—overtakes the flight of an arrow, however well it has been shot. He flies up joyfully at the first break of dawn, wishing the night to be no more, wishing the dawn, that has not yet come, to come [^1050].

21\. He grazes the hidden ways [^1051] of the mountains, he grazes the tops of the mountains, he grazes the depths of the vales, he grazes the summit [^1052] of the trees, listening to the voices of the birds.

<span id="p237"><sup><small>[ p. 237 ]</small></sup></span>

For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

## XIV.

Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!

<span id="p241"><sup><small>[ p. 241 ]</small></sup></span>

‘If I have a curse thrown upon me, a spell told upon me by the many men who hate me, what is the remedy for it?’

35\. Ahura Mazda answered: Take thou a feather of that bird with . . . . [^1064] feathers, the Vâre<i>n</i><i>g</i>ana, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! With that feather thou shalt rub thy own body [^1065], with that feather thou shalt curse back thy enemies.

36\. 'If a man holds a bone of that strong bird, or a feather of that strong bird, no one can smite or turn to flight that fortunate man. The feather of that bird of birds brings him help; it brings unto him the homage of men, it maintains in him his glory.

37\. 'Then the sovereign, the lord of countries, will no longer kill his [^1066] hundreds, though he is a killer of men; the . . . . [^1067] will not kill at one stroke; he alone smites and goes forwards.

38\. 'All tremble before him who holds the feather, they tremble therefore before me; all my enemies tremble before me and fear my strength and victorious force and the fierceness established in my body.

39\. 'He [^1068] carries the chariot of the lords; he carries the chariots of the lordly ones, the chariots of the sovereigns. He carried the chariot of Kavi <span id="p242"><sup><small>[ p. 242 ]</small></sup></span> Usa [^1069]; upon his wings runs the male horse [^1070], runs the burden-bearing camel, runs the water of the river.

40\. 'Him rode the gallant Thraêtaona, who smote A<i>z</i>i Dahâka, the three-mouthed, the three-headed, the six-eyed, who had a thousand senses; that most powerful, fiendish Dru<i>g</i>, that demon, baleful to the world, the strongest Dru<i>g</i> that Angra Mainyu created against the material world, to destroy the world of the good principle [^1071].

‘For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

## XV.

41\. 'We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.

‘Verethraghna confounds the glory of this house with its wealth in cattle. He is like that great bird, the Saêna [^1072]; he is like the big clouds, full of water, that beat the mountains.

‘For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

## XVI.

42\. ‘We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.’

Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!

‘Where is it that we must invoke the name of Verethraghna, made by Ahura? Where is it that <span id="p243"><sup><small>[ p. 243 ]</small></sup></span> we must praise him? That we must humbly praise him?’

43\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'When armies meet together in full array, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! (asking) which of the two is the party that conquers and is not crushed, that smites and is not smitten;

44\. 'Do thou throw [^1073] four feathers [^1074] in the way. Whichever of the two will first worship the well-shapen Strength, and Verethraghna, beautiful of form, made by Mazda, on his side will victory stand.

45\. 'I will bless Strength and Victory, the two keepers, the two good keepers, the two maintainers; the two who . . . . [^1075], the two who . . . . [^1075], the two who . . . . [^1075]; the two who forgive, the two who strike off, the two who forget [^1076].

46\. ‘O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! let not that spell be shown to any one, except by the father to his son, or by the brother to his brother from the same womb, or by the Âthravan to his pupil [^1077]. These are words that are awful and powerful, awful and assembly-ruling, awful and victorious, awful and healing; these are words that save the head that was lost and chant away the uplifted weapon.’

## XVII.

47\. We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura: who goes along the armies arrayed, and goes here <span id="p244"><sup><small>[ p. 244 ]</small></sup></span> and there asking, along with Mithra and Rashnu: 'Who is it who lies unto Mithra? Who is it who thrusts \[his oath\] against Rashnu [^1078]? To whom shall I, in my might, impart illness and death [^1079]?

48 [^1080]. Ahura Mazda said: ‘If men sacrifice unto Verethraghna, made by Ahura, if the due sacrifice and prayer is offered unto him just as it ought to be performed in the perfection of holiness, never will a hostile horde enter the Aryan countries, nor any plague, nor leprosy, nor venomous plants, nor the chariot of a foe, nor the uplifted spear of a foe.’

49 [^1081]. Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked: ‘What is then, O Ahura Mazda! the sacrifice and invocation in honour of Verethraghna, made by Ahura, as it ought to be performed in the perfection of holiness?’

50\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Let the Aryan nations bring libations unto him; let the Aryan nations tie bundles of baresma for him; let the Aryan nations cook for him a head of cattle, either white, or black, or of any other colour, but all of one and the same colour.

51\. 'Let not a murderer take of those offerings, nor a whore, nor a . . . ., who does not sing the Gâthâs, who spreads death in the world and withstands the law of Mazda, the law of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra.

52\. 'If a murderer take of those offerings, or a whore, or a . . . ., who does not sing the Gâthâs, then Verethraghna, made by Ahura, takes back his healing virtues. <span id="p245"><sup><small>[ p. 245 ]</small></sup></span> 53\. ‘Plagues will ever pour upon the Aryan nations; hostile hordes will ever fall upon the Aryan nations; the Aryans will be smitten by their fifties and their hundreds, by their hundreds and their thousands, by their thousands and their tens of thousands, by their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.’

54\. There Verethraghna, made by Ahura, proclaimed thus: 'The Soul of the Bull [^1082], the wise creature, does not receive from man due sacrifice and prayer; for now the Daêvas and the worshippers of the Daêvas make blood flow and spill it like water;

55\. 'For now the . . . . [^1083] Daêvas and the worshippers of the Daêvas bring to the fire the plant that is called Haperesi, the wood that is called Neme<i>t</i>ka [^1084];

56\. ‘(Therefore) when the . . . . [^1083] Daêvas and the worshippers of the Daêvas bow their backs, bend their waists, and arrange all their limbs [^1085], they think they will smite and smite not, they think they will kill and kill not; and then the . . . Daêvas and the worshippers of the Daêvas have their minds confounded and their eyes made giddy [^1086].’

For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

<span id="p246"><sup><small>[ p. 246 ]</small></sup></span>

## XVIII.

57\. We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.

I offer up Haoma, who saves one's head [^1087]; I offer up the victorious Haoma; I offer him up, the good protector; I offer up Haoma, who is a protector to my body, as a man who shall drink [^1088] of him shall win and prevail [^1089] over his enemies in battle;

58\. That I may smite this army, that I may smite down this army, that I may cut in pieces this army that is coming behind me.

For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

## XIX.

59\. We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.

The prince and his son and his sons who are chiefs of myriads [^1090] offer him up a bright . . . . [^1091] \[saying\]: ‘He is strong, and Victorious is his name; he is victorious, arid Strong is his name;’

60\. That I may be as constantly victorious as any one of all the Aryans [^1092]; that I may smite this army, that I may smite down this army, that I may cut in pieces this army that is coming behind me.

For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

<span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span>

## XX.

61\. We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

In the ox is our strength, in the ox is our need [^1093]; in the ox is our speech, in the ox is our victory; in the ox is our food, in the ox is our clothing; in the ox is tillage, that makes food grow for us.

For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

## XXI.

62\. We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura;

Who breaks the columns asunder, who cuts the columns to pieces, who wounds the columns, who makes the columns shake; who comes and breaks the columns asunder, who comes and cuts the columns to pieces, who comes and wounds the columns, who comes and makes the columns shake, both of Daêvas and men, of the Yâtus and Pairikas, of the oppressors, the blind, and the deaf.

For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . .

## XXII.

63\. We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.

When Verethraghna, made by Ahura, binds the hands, confounds the eye-sight, takes the hearing <span id="p248"><sup><small>[ p. 248 ]</small></sup></span> from the ears of the Mithradru<i>g</i>es [^1094] marching in columns, allied by cities, they can no longer move their feet, they can no longer withstand.

For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

64\. Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness. . . . .

I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of Verethraghna, made by Mazda; and of the crushing Ascendant.

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

\[Give\] unto that man [^1095] brightness and glory, . . . . give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.
