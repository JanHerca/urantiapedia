The Fravashi is the inner power in every being that maintains it and makes it grow and subsist. Originally the Fravashis were the same as the Pit_ri_s of the Hindus or the Manes of the Latins, that is to say, the everlasting and deified souls of the dead (see §§ 49-52); but in course of time they gained a wider domain, and not only men, but gods and even physical objects, like the sky and the earth, &c. (§§ 85-86), had each a Fravashi (see Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 111-113).

This Ya_s_t is to be divided into two parts. The former part (§§ 1-84) is a glorification of the powers and attributes of the Fravashis in general; the latter part (§§ 85–158) is an enumeration of the Fravashis of the most celebrated heroes of Mazdeism, from the first man, Gaya Maretan, down to the last, Saoshya_n__t_.

This latter part is like a Homer's catalogue of Mazdeism. The greatest part of the historical legends of Iran lies here condensed into a register of proper names. This enumeration is divided into seven chapters:

The first (XXIV, §§ 85-95) contains the names of several gods, of the first man, Gaya Maretan, the first law-giver, Zarathu_s_tra, and his first disciple, Maidhyô-m_a_ungha;

The second part (XXV, §§ 96-110) contains the names of the disciples of Zarathu_s_tra, most of them belonging to the epical cyclus of Vî_s_tâspa (Gu_s_tâsp);

The third part (XXVI, §§ 111-117) is of uncertain character, and no name contained in it is found in the epical legends;

The fourth part (XXVII, §§ 118-128) seems to be devoted to the heroes of the other Karshvares and to mythical beings, born or unborn (cf. §§ 121, 122, 127, 128);

The fifth part (XXVIII, § 129) is devoted to Saoshya_n__t_ alone; The sixth part (XXIX, §§ 130-138) is devoted to the heroes before the time of Zarathu_s_tra;

The seventh part (XXX, §§ 139-142) is devoted to the holy women of Mazdeism from Hvôvi, Zarathu_s_tra's wife, down to Srûta_t_\-fedhri, Vanghu-fedhri, and Ereda_t_\-fedhri, the future mothers of his three unborn sons.

The second, third, and fourth enumerations all end with the <span id="p180">[<sup><small>p. 180</small></sup>]</span> name of Astva_t_\-ereta (that is to say, Saoshya_n__t_), which shows that they do not refer to successive generations, but to three independent branches, which are each developed apart down to the time of the Saviour.

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu_s_tra, one who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\], the holy and master of holiness.

Unto the awful, overpowering Fravashis of the faithful; unto the Fravashis of the men of the primitive law [^810]; unto the Fravashis of the next-of-kin,

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness. . . .

## I.

1\. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu_s_tra, saying: 'Do thou proclaim, O pure Zarathu_s_tra! the vigour and strength, the glory, the help and the joy that are in the Fravashis of the faithful, the awful and overpowering Fravashis; do thou tell how they come to help me, how they bring assistance unto me, the awful Fravashis of the faithful [^811].

2\. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathu_s_tra! I maintain that sky, there above, shining and seen afar, and encompassing this earth all around.

3\. 'It looks like a palace, that stands built of a <span id="p181">[<sup><small>p. 181</small></sup>]</span> heavenly substance [^812], firmly established, with ends that lie afar, shining in its body of ruby over the three-thirds (of the earth) [^813]; it is like a garment inlaid with stars, made of a heavenly substance, that Mazda puts on, along with Mithra and Rashnu and Spe_n_ta-Ârmaiti, and on no side can the eye perceive the end of it.

4\. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathu_s_tra! I maintain Ardvi Sara Anâhita, the wide-expanding and health-giving, who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura, who is worthy of sacrifice in the material world, worthy of prayer in the material world; the life-increasing and holy, the flocks-increasing and holy, the fold-increasing and holy, the wealth-increasing and holy, the country-increasing and holy [^814];

5 [^815]. 'Who makes the seed of all males pure, who makes the womb of all females pure for bringing forth, who makes all females bring forth in safety, who puts milk in the breasts of all females in the right measure and the right quality;

6\. 'The large river, known afar, that is as large as the whole of all the waters that run along the earth; that runs powerfully from the height Hukairya down to the sea Vouru-Kasha.

7\. 'All the shores of the sea Vouru-Kasha are boiling over, all the middle of it is boiling over, <span id="p182">[<sup><small>p. 182</small></sup>]</span> when she runs down there, when she streams down there, she, Ardvi Sûra Anâhita, who has a thousand cells and a thousand channels; the extent of each of those cells, of each of those channels, is as much as a man can ride in forty days, riding on a good horse.

8\. 'From this river of mine alone flow all the waters that spread all over the seven Karshvares; this river of mine alone goes on bringing waters, both in summer and in winter. This river of mine purifies the seed in males, the womb in females, the milk in females’ breasts [^816].

9\. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathu_s_tra! I maintain the wide earth made by Ahura, the large and broad earth, that bears so much that is fine, that bears all the bodily world, the live and the dead, and the high mountains, rich in pastures and waters;

10\. 'Upon which run the many streams and rivers; upon which the many kinds of plants grow up from the ground, to nourish animals and men, to nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals [^817], and to help the faithful.

11\. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathu_s_tra! I maintain in the womb the child that has been conceived, so that it does not die from the <span id="p183">[<sup><small>p. 183</small></sup>]</span> assaults of Vîdôtu [^818], and I develop in it [^819] the bones, the hair, the . . . .  [^820], the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs.

12\. 'Had not the awful Fravashis of the faithful given help unto me, those animals and men of mine, of which there are such excellent kinds, would not subsist; strength would belong to the Dru_g_, the dominion would belong to the Dru_g_, the material world would belong to the Dru_g_.

13\. 'Between the earth and the sky the immaterial creatures would be harassed by the Dru_g_; between the earth and the sky the immaterial creatures would be smitten by the Dru_g_; and never afterwards would Angra-Mainyu give way to the blows of Spe_n_ta-Mainyu.

14\. 'Through their brightness and glory the waters run and flow forward from the never-failing springs; through their brightness and glory the plants grow up from the earth, by the never-failing springs; through their brightness and glory the winds blow, driving down the clouds towards the never-failing springs.

15\. 'Through their brightness and glory the females conceive offspring; through their brightness and glory they bring forth in safety; it is through their brightness and glory when they become blessed with children.

16\. 'Through their brightness and glory a man is born who is a chief in assemblies and meetings [^821], who listens well [^822] to the (holy) words, whom Wisdom <span id="p184">[<sup><small>p. 184</small></sup>]</span> holds dear [^823], and who returns a victor from discussions with Gaotema, the heretic [^824].

‘Through their brightness and glory the sun goes his way; through their brightness and glory the moon goes her way; through their brightness and glory the stars go their way.

17\. 'In fearful battles they are the wisest for help, the Fravashis of the faithful.

‘The most powerful amongst the Fravashis of the faithful, O Spitama! are those of the men of the primitive law [^825] or those of the Saoshya_n__t_s [^826] not yet born, who are to restore the world. Of the Others, the Fravashis of the living faithful are more powerful, O Zarathu_s_tra! than those of the dead, O Spitama!

18\. 'And the man who in life shall treat the Fravashis of the faithful well, will become a ruler of the country with full power, and a chief most strong; so shall any man of you become, who shall treat Mithra well, the lord of wide pastures, and Ar_s_tâ_t_, who makes the world grow, who makes the world increase.

19\. ‘Thus do I proclaim unto thee, O pure Spitama! the vigour and strength, the glory, the help, and the joy that are in the Fravashis of the faithful, <span id="p185">[<sup><small>p. 185</small></sup>]</span> the awful and overpowering Fravashis; and how they come to help me, how they bring assistance unto me, the awful Fravashis of the faithful [^827].’

## II.

20\. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu_s_tra, saying: 'If in this material world, O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra! thou happenest to come upon frightful roads, full of dangers and fears, O Zarathu_s_tra! and thou fearest for thyself, then do thou recite these words, then proclaim these fiend-smiting words, O Zarathu_s_tra!

21\. ' "I praise, I invoke, I meditate upon, and we sacrifice unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful. We worship the Fravashis of the masters of the houses, those of the lords of the boroughs, those of the lords of the towns, those of the lords of the countries, those of the Zarathu_s_trôtemas [^828]; the Fravashis of those that are, the Fravashis of those that have been, the Fravashis of those that will be; all the Fravashis of all nations [^829], and most friendly the Fravashis of the friendly nations;

22\. ' "Who maintain the sky, who maintain the waters, who maintain the earth, who maintain the cattle, who maintain in the womb the child that has been conceived, so that it does not die from the assaults of Vîdôtu, and develop in it the bones, the hair, the . . . ., the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs [^830];

23\. ' "Who are much-bringing, who move with <span id="p186">[<sup><small>p. 186</small></sup>]</span> awfulness, well-moving, swiftly moving, quickly moving, who move when invoked; who are to be invoked in the conquest of good, who are to be invoked in fights against foes, who are to be invoked in battles;

24\. ' "Who give victory to their invoker, who give boons to their lover, who give health to the sick man, who give good Glory to the faithful man that brings libations and invokes them with a sacrifice and words of propitiation [^831];

25\. ‘ “Who turn to that side where are faithful men, most devoted to holiness, and where is the greatest piety [^832], where the faithful man is rejoiced [^833], and where the faithful man is not ill-treated [^834].” ’

## III.

26\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who are the mightiest of drivers, the lightest of those driving forwards, the slowest of the retiring [^835], the safest [^835] of all bridges, the least-erring [^835] of all weapons and arms [^836], and who never turn their backs [^837].

27\. At once, wherever they come, we worship them, the good ones, the excellent ones, the good, the strong, the beneficent Fravashis of the faithful. They are to be invoked when the bundles of baresma are tied; they are to be invoked in fights against foes, in battles [^838], and there where gallant men strive to conquer foes. <span id="p187">[<sup><small>p. 187</small></sup>]</span> 28\. Mazda invoked them for help, when he fixed the sky and the waters and the earth and the plants; when Spe_n_ta-Mainyu fixed the sky, when he fixed the waters, when the earth, when the cattle, when the plants, when the child conceived in the womb, so that it should not die from the assaults of Vîdôtu, and developed in it the bones, the hair, the . . . ., the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs [^839].

29\. Spe_n_ta-Mainyu maintained the sky, and they sustained it from below, they, the strong Fravashis, who sit in silence, gazing with sharp looks; whose eyes and ears are powerful, who bring long joy, high and high-girded; well-moving and moving afar, loud-snorting [^840], possessing riches and a high renown.

## IV.

30\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful; whose friendship is good, and who know how to benefit; whose friendship lasts long; who like to stay in the abode where they are not harmed by its dwellers; who are good, beautiful afar [^841], health-giving, of high renown, conquering in battle, and who never do harm first.

## V.

31\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful; whose will is dreadful unto those who vex them; powerfully working and most beneficent; who in battle break the dread arms of their foes and haters.

<span id="p188">[<sup><small>p. 188</small></sup>]</span>

## VI.

32\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful; liberal, valiant, and full of strength, not to be seized by thought, welfare-giving, kind, and health-giving, following with Ashi's remedies, as far as the earth extends, as the rivers stretch, as the sun rises [^842].

## VII.

33\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who gallantly and bravely fight, causing havoc, wounding [^843], breaking to pieces all the malice of the malicious, Daêvas and men, and smiting powerfully in battle, at their wish and will.

34\. You kindly deliver the Victory made by Ahura, and the crushing Ascendant, most beneficently, to those countries where you, the good ones, unharmed and rejoiced, unoppressed and unoffended, have been held worthy of sacrifice and prayer, and proceed the way of your wish.

## VIII.

35\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, of high renown, smiting in battle, most strong, shield-bearing and harmless to those who are true, whom both the pursuing and the fleeing invoke for help: the pursuer invokes <span id="p189">[<sup><small>p. 189</small></sup>]</span> them for a swift race, and for a swift race does the fleer invoke them;

36\. Who turn to that side where are faithful men, most devoted to holiness, and where is the greatest piety, where the faithful man is rejoiced, and where the faithful man is not ill-treated [^844].

## IX.

37\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who form many battalions, girded with weapons [^845], lifting up spears, and full of sheen; who in fearful battles come rushing along where the gallant heroes [^846] go and assail the Dânus [^847].

38\. There you destroy the victorious strength of the Turanian Dânus; there you destroy the malice of the Turanian Dânus; through you the chiefs [^848] are of high intellect [^849] and most successful; they, the gallant heroes the gallant Saoshya_n__t_s [^850], the gallant conquerors of the offspring of the Dânus chiefs of myriads, who wound with stones [^851].

## X.

39\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who rout the two wings of an army standing in battle array, who make the centre swerve, and swiftly pursue onwards, to help the faithful and to distress the doers of evil deeds.

## XI.

40\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent <span id="p190">[<sup><small>p. 190</small></sup>]</span> Fravashis of the faithful; awful, overpowering, and victorious, smiting in battle, sorely wounding, blowing away (the foes), moving along to and fro, of good renown, fair of body, godly of soul, and holy; who give victory to their invoker, who give boons to their lover, who give health to the sick man [^852];

41\. Who give good glory to him who worships them with a sacrifice, as that man did worship them, the holy Zarathu_s_tra, the chief of the material world, the head of the two-footed race, in whatever struggle he had to enter, in whatever distress he did fear;

42\. Who, when well invoked, enjoy bliss in the heavens; who, when well invoked, come forward from the heavens, who are the heads [^853] of that sky above, possessing the well-shapen Strength, the Victory made by Ahura, the crushing Ascendant, and Welfare [^854], the wealth-bringing, boon-bringing, holy, well fed, worthy of sacrifice and prayer in the perfection of holiness.

43\. They shed Satavaêsa [^855] between the earth and the sky, him to whom the waters belong [^856], who listens to appeals and makes the waters flow and the plants grow up, to nourish animals and men, to nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals [^857], and to help the faithful [^858].

44\. Satavaêsa comes down and flows between the earth and the sky, he to whom the waters belong, who listens to appeals and makes the waters and the plants grow up, fair, radiant, and full of <span id="p191">[<sup><small>p. 191</small></sup>]</span> light, to nourish animals and men, to nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals, and to help the faithful.

## XII.

45\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful; with helms of brass, with weapons of brass, with armour [^859] of brass; who struggle in the fights for victory in garments of light, arraying the battles and bringing them forwards, to kill thousands of Daêvas.

When the wind blows from behind them [^860] and brings their breath unto men,

46\. Then men know where blows the breath of victory: and they pay pious homage unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, with their hearts prepared and their arms uplifted.

47\. Whichever side they have been first worshipped in the fulness of faith of a devoted heart [^861], to that side turn the awful Fravashis of the faithful, along with Mithra and Rashnu and the awful cursing thought [^862] of the wise and the victorious wind.

48\. And those nations are smitten at one stroke by their fifties and their hundreds, by their hundreds and their thousands, by their thousands and their tens of thousands, by their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads, against which turn the awful Fravashis of the faithful, along with Mithra and Rashnu, and the awful cursing thought of the wise and the victorious wind.

<span id="p192">[<sup><small>p. 192</small></sup>]</span>

## XIII.

49\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who come and go through the borough at the time of the Hamaspathmaêdha [^863]; they go along there for ten nights, asking thus [^864]:

50\. ‘Who will praise us? Who will offer us a sacrifice? Who will meditate upon us? Who will bless us [^865]? Who will receive us with meat and clothes in his hand [^866] and with a prayer worthy of bliss [^867]? Of which of us will the name be taken for invocation [^868]? Of which of you will the soul be worshipped by you with a sacrifice [^869]? To whom will this gift of ours be given, that he may have never-failing food for ever and ever?’

51\. And the man who offers them up a sacrifice, <span id="p193">[<sup><small>p. 193</small></sup>]</span> with meat and clothes in his hand, with a prayer worthy of bliss, the awful Fravashis of the faithful, satisfied, unharmed, and unoffended, bless thus:

52\. ‘May there be in this house flocks of animals and men! May there be a swift horse and a solid chariot! May there be a man who knows how to praise God [^870] and rule in an assembly, who will offer us sacrifices with meat and clothes in his hand, and with a prayer worthy of bliss [^871].’

## XIV.

53\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who show beautiful paths to the waters, made by Mazda, which had stood before for a long time in the same place without flowing [^872]:

54\. And now they flow along the path made by Mazda, along the way made by the gods, the watery way appointed to them, at the wish of Ahura Mazda, at the wish of the Amesha-Spe_n_tas.

## XV.

55\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who show a beautiful growth to the fertile [^873] plants, which had stood before for a long time in the same place without growing:

56\. And now they grow up along the path made <span id="p194">[<sup><small>p. 194</small></sup>]</span> by Mazda, along the way made by the gods, in the time appointed to them, at the wish of Ahura Mazda, at the wish of the Amesha-Spe_n_tas.

## XVI.

57\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who showed their paths to the stars, the moon, the sun, and the endless lights, that had stood before for a long time in the same place, without moving forwards, through the oppression of the Daêvas and the assaults of the Daêvas [^874].

58\. And now they move around in their far-revolving circle for ever, till they come to the time of the good restoration of the world.

## XVII.

59\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who watch over the bright sea Vouru-Kasha [^875], to the number of ninety thousand, and nine thousand, and nine hundred, and ninety-nine.

## XVIII.

60\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who watch over the stars Haptôiri_n_ga [^876], to the number of ninety thousand, and nine thousand, and nine hundred, and ninety-nine.

## XIX.

61\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who watch over the body <span id="p195">[<sup><small>p. 195</small></sup>]</span> of Keresâspa, the son of Sâma [^877], the club-bearer with plaited hair, to the number of ninety thousand, and nine thousand, and nine hundred, and ninety-nine.

## XX.

62\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who watch over the seed of the holy Zarathu_s_tra [^878], to the number of ninety thousand, and nine thousand, and nine hundred, and ninety-nine.

## XXI.

63\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who fight at the right hand of the reigning lord, if he rejoices the faithful [^879] and if the awful Fravashis of the faithful are not hurt by him, if they are rejoiced by him, unharmed and unoffended.

## XXII.

64\. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who are greater, who are <span id="p196">[<sup><small>p. 196</small></sup>]</span> stronger, who are swifter, who are more powerful, who are more victorious, who are more healing, who are more effective than can be expressed by words; who run by tens of thousands into the midst of the Myazdas.

65\. And when the waters come up from the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra! along with the Glory made by Mazda [^880], then forwards come the awful Fravashis of the faithful, many and many hundreds, many and many thousands, many and many tens of thousands,

66\. Seeking water for their own kindred, for their own borough, for their own town, for their own country, and saying thus: ‘May our own country have a good store and full joy!’

67\. They fight in the battles that are fought in their own place and land, each according to the place and house where he dwelt (of yore) [^881]: they look like a gallant warrior who, girded up and watchful, fights for the hoard he has treasured up.

68\. And those of them who win bring waters to their own kindred, to their own borough, to their own town, to their own country, saying thus: ‘May my country grow and increase!’

69\. And when the all-powerful sovereign of a country has been surprised by his foes and haters, he invokes them, the awful Fravashis of the faithful.

70\. And they come to his help, if they have not been hurt by him, if they have been rejoiced by him, if they have not been harmed nor offended, the awful Fravashis of the faithful: they come flying unto him, it seems as if they were well-winged birds. <span id="p197">[<sup><small>p. 197</small></sup>]</span> 71\. They come in as a weapon and as a shield, to keep him behind and to keep him in front, from the Dru_g_ unseen, from the female Varenya fiend, from the evil-doer bent on mischief, and from that fiend who is all death, Angra Mainyu. It will be as if there were a thousand men watching over one man [^882];

72\. So that neither the sword well-thrust, neither the club well-falling, nor the arrow well-shot, nor the spear well-darted, nor the stones flung from the arm shall destroy him.

73\. They come on this side, they come on that side, never resting, the good, powerful, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, asking for help thus: ‘Who will praise us? Who will offer us a sacrifice? Who will meditate upon us? Who will bless us? Who will receive us with meat and clothes in his hand and with a prayer worthy of bliss? Of which of us will the name be taken for invocation? Of which of you will the soul be worshipped by you with a sacrifice? To whom will that gift of ours be given, that he may have never-failing food for ever and ever [^883]?’

74\. We worship the perception [^884]; we worship the intellect; we worship the conscience; we worship those of the Saoshya_n__t_s [^885];

We worship the souls; those of the tame animals; those of the wild animals; those of the animals that live in the waters; those of the animals that live under the ground; those of the flying ones; those of the running ones; those of the grazing ones [^886].

<span id="p198">[<sup><small>p. 198</small></sup>]</span>

We worship their Fravashis [^887].

75\. We worship the Fravashis.

We worship them, the liberal;

We worship them, the valiant; we worship them, the most valiant;

We worship them, the beneficent; we worship them, the most beneficent;

We worship them, the powerful;

We worship them, the most strong;

We worship them, the light; we worship them, the most light;

We worship them, the effective; we worship them, the most effective.

76\. They are the most effective amongst the creatures of the two Spirits, they the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who stood holding fast when the two Spirits created the world, the Good Spirit and the Evil One [^888].

77\. When Angra Mainyu broke into the creation of the good holiness, then came in across Vohû Manô and Âtar [^889].

78\. They destroyed the malice of the fiend Angra Mainyu, so that the waters did not stop flowing nor did the plants stop growing; but at once the most beneficent waters of the creator and <span id="p199">[<sup><small>p. 199</small></sup>]</span> ruler, Ahura Mazda, flowed forward and his plants went on growing.

They protect us when in distress with manifest assistance, with the assistance of Ahura Mazda and of the holy, powerful Sraosha, and with the Mãthra-Spe_n_ta, the all-knowing, who hates the Daêvas with a mighty hate, a friend of Ahura Mazda, whom Zarathu_s_tra worshipped so greatly in the material world.

152\. We worship Zarathu_s_tra, the lord and master of all the material world, the man of the primitive law; the wisest of all beings, the best-ruling of all beings, the brightest of all beings, the most glorious of all beings, the most worthy of sacrifice amongst all beings, the most worthy of prayer amongst all beings, the most worthy of propitiation amongst all beings, the most worthy of glorification amongst all beings, whom we call well-desired and worthy of sacrifice and prayer as much as any being can be, in the perfection of his holiness.

157\. May they, being satisfied, bless this house with the presence of the kind Ashi Vanguhi! May they leave this house satisfied! May they carry back from here hymns and worship to the Maker, Ahura Mazda, and the Amesha-Spe_n_tas! May they not leave this house of us, the worshippers of Mazda, complaining!

## Footnotes

[^851]: 180:1 The so-called paoiryô-_t_kaêsha: the primitive law is what ‘is considered as the true Mazdayasnian religion in all ages, both before and after the time of Zaratû_s_t’ (West, Pahlavi Texts, I, 242, note 1); cf. § 150.

[^852]: 180:2 Cf. § 19.

[^854]: 181:2 A division of the earth different from and older than the division into seven Karshvares; cf. Yasna XI, 7 \[21\]; this division was derived by analogy from the tripartite division of the universe (earth, atmosphere, and heaven).

[^855]: 181:3 Yt. V, 1.

[^856]: 181:4 §§ 5-8 = Yt. V, 2-5.

[^857]: 182:1 §§ 4-8 = Yt. V, 1-5.

[^858]: 182:2 There are five classes of animals: those living in waters (upâpa), those living under the ground (upasma = upa-zema), the flying ones (fraptar_g_at), the running ones (ravas_k_arant), the grazing ones (_k_angranghâ_k_); Vispêrad I, 1 seq.; Yt. XIII, 74. The representatives of those several classes are the kar mâhî fish, the ermine, the kar_s_ipt, the hare, and the ass-goat (Pahl. Comm. ad Visp. l. l.).

[^859]: 183:1 See Vend. IV, 40 \[137\].

[^860]: 183:2 Doubtful.

[^865]: 184:2 Yô nâidhyanghô gaotemahê parô ay_a_u par_s_tôi_t_ avâiti. This seems to be an allusion to controversies with the Buddhists or Gotama's disciples, whose religion had obtained a footing in the western parts of Iran as early as the second century before Christ. Nâidhyanghô means a heretic, an Ashemaogha (see Pahl. Comm. ad Yasna XXXIV, 8).

[^874]: 186:3 With alms (ashô-dâd).

[^875]: 186:4 Cf. § 36.

[^878]: 186:5 Doubtful.

[^880]: 186:7 To flee.

[^881]: 186:8 Cf. § 23.

[^882]: 187:1 Cf. §§ 11, 22.

[^883]: 187:2 They are compared to horses; cf. Yt. VIII, 2.

[^884]: 187:3 Their beauty is seen afar. One manuscript has ‘known afar;’ another, ‘whose eyesight reaches far.’

[^885]: 188:1 All the beneficent powers hidden in the earth, in the waters, and in the sun, and which Ashi Vanguhi (Yt. XVII) imparts to man.

[^886]: 188:2 Doubtful: urvaênaitî_s_.

These last ten days should be spent in deeds of charity, religious banquets (_g_a_s_an), and ceremonies in memory of the dead. It was also at the approach of the spring that the Romans and the Athenians used to offer annual sacrifices to the dead; the Romans in February ‘qui tunc extremus anni mensis erat’ (Cicero, De Legibus, II, 21), the Athenians on the third day of the Anthesterion feast (in the same month). The souls of the dead were supposed to partake of the new life then beginning to circulate through nature, that had also been dead during the long months of winter.

[^907]: 192:2 Perhaps: asking for help, thus.

[^908]: 192:3 Frînâ_t_: who will pronounce the Âfrîn?

[^909]: 192:4 To be given in alms to poor Mazdayasnians (ashô-dâd).

[^910]: 192:5 Asha-nasa: that makes him reach the condition of one of the blessed (ahlâyîh arzânîk, Vend. XVIII, 6 \[17\]): the Sanskrit translation has, ‘that is to say, that makes him worthy of a great reward.’

[^911]: 192:6 As in the invocations from § 87 to the end.

[^912]: 192:7 An allusion to the formula: ‘I sacrifice to the Fravashi of my own soul,’ Yasna XXIII, 4 \[6\].

[^913]: 193:1 Stâhyô: stutikaro (Sansk. tr.; cf. Âtash Nyâyi_s_, 10).

[^914]: 193:2 §§ 49-52 are a part of the so-called Âfrîgân Dahmân (a prayer recited in honour of the dead); a Sanskrit translation of that Âfrîgân has been published by Burnouf in his Études zendes.

[^915]: 193:3 In winter.

[^916]: 193:4 Doubtful. The word is _h__v_awrîra, which Aspendiârji makes synonymous with _h__v_âpara, kind, merciful (Vispêrad XXI \[XXIV\], 1).

[^917]: 194:1 Bundahi_s_ VI, 3.

[^918]: 194:2 To keep the white Hôm there from the evil beings that try to destroy it (Minokhirad LXII, 28).

[^920]: 195:1 Keresâspa lies asleep in the plain of Pê_s_yânsâi; ‘the glory (far) of heaven stands over him for the purpose that, when A_z_\-i-Dahâk becomes unfettered, he may arise and slay him; and a myriad guardian spirits of the righteous are as a protection to him’ (Bundahi_s_ XXIX, 8; tr. West).

[^921]: 195:2 ‘Zaratû_s_t went near unto Hvôv (Hvôgvi, his wife) three times, and each time the seed went to the ground; the angel Nêryôsang received the brilliance and strength of that seed, delivered it with care to the angel Anâhî_d_, and in time will blend it with a mother’ (Bundahi_s_ XXXII, 8). A maid, Ereda_t_\-fedhri, bathing in Lake Kãsava, will conceive by that seed and bring forth the Saviour Saoshya_n__t_; his two fore-runners, Ukhshya_t_\-ereta and Ukhshya_t_\-nemah, will be born in the same way of Srûta_t_\-fedhri and Vanghu-fedhri (Yt. XIII, 141-142).

[^929]: 197:5 Cf. Yt. XIII, 10.

[^930]: 198:1 There seems to be in this paragraph a distinction of five faculties of the soul, âsna, mana, daêna, urvan, fravashi. The usual classification, as given in this Ya_s_t, § 149, and in later Parsism (Spiegel, Die traditionelle Literatur der Parsen, p. 172), is: ahu, spirit of life (?); daêna, conscience; baodhô, perception; urvan, the soul; fravashi.

[^931]: 198:2 The Fravashis, ‘on war horses and spear in hand, were around the sky . . . . and no passage was found by the evil spirit, who rushed back’ (Bund. VI, 3-4; tr. West).

[^932]: 198:3 Cf. Ormazd et Ahriman, § 107.

[^933]: 199:1 That is to say, after their different kinds (described in Yasna XXXVIII, 3, 5 \[7-9, 13-14\]; LXVIII, 8 \[LXVII, 15\]; and Bund. XXI).

[^934]: 199:2 After their kinds (Bund. XXVII).

[^937]: 200:2 Cf. Yt. XIX, 15, 17.

[^948]: 200:13 The first man. On the myths of Gaya Maretan, see Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 129-135.

[^949]: 201:1 As having established those three classes. His three earthly sons, Isa_t_\-vâstra, Urvata_t_\-nara, and _H__v_are-_k_ithra (§ 98), were the chiefs of the three classes. Cf. Vend. Introd. III, 15, note 3.

[^952]: 201:4 The divine Order, Asha.

[^953]: 201:5 The wheel of sovereignty (?); cf. Yt. X, 67; this expression smacks of Buddhism.

[^955]: 202:1 Material lord and spiritual master.

[^956]: 202:2 The reciter of the Ashem Vohû.

[^959]: 203:1 Maidhyô-m_a_ungha was the cousin and first disciple of Zarathu_s_tra; Zarathu_s_tra's father, Pourushaspa, and Ârâsti were brothers (Bund. XXXII, 3); cf. Yasna LI \[L\], 19.

[^960]: 203:2 Cf. [p. 33](Yasts_1#p33), note [2](Yasts_1#fn173); Yt. XXII, 37.

[^961]: 203:3 Another Par_s_a_t_\-g_a_u_s_ is mentioned § 126.

[^962]: 203:4 Possibly, ‘the holy falcon, praiser of the lord;’ thus the Law was brought to the Var of Yima by the bird Kar_s_ipta (Vend. II, 42), who recites the Avesta in the language of birds (Bund. XIX, 16): the Saêna-bird (Sîmurgh) became in later literature a mythical incarnation of Supreme wisdom (see the Mantik uttair and Dabistân I, 55).

[^963]: 203:5 Who was the first regular teacher, the first aêthrapaiti.

[^964]: 204:1 ‘By Zaratû_s_t were begotten three sons and three daughters; one son was Isa_d_vâstar, one Aûrvata_d_\-nar, and one Khûrshê_d_\-_k_îhar; as Isa_d_vâstar was chief of the priests he became the Môbad of Môbads, and passed away in the hundredth year of the religion; Aûrvata_d_\-nar was an agriculturist, and the chief of the enclosure formed by Yim, which is below the earth (see Vend. II, 43 \[141\]); Khûrshê_d_\-_k_îhar was a warrior, commander of the army of Pêshyôtanû, son of Vi_s_tâsp (see Yt. XXIV, 4), and dwells in Kangde_z_; and of the three daughters the name of one was Frên, of one Srît, and of one Pôru_k_îst (see Yt. XIII, 139). Aûrvata_d_\-nar and Khûrshê_d_\-_k_îhar were from a serving (_k_akar) wife, the rest were from a privileged (pâ_d_akhshah) wife’ (Bund. XXXII, 5-6; tr. West).

[^965]: 204:2 According to Anquetil, ‘the threefold seed of Spitama Zarathu_s_tra;’ cf. above, § 62.

[^966]: 204:3 The king of Bactra, the champion of Zoroastrism; cf. Yt. V, 98,108.

[^968]: 205:1 Dru_g_a paurva_n__k_a, possibly, ‘with the spear pushed forwards’ (reading dru_k_a).

[^969]: 205:2 Daêna, the religion.

[^970]: 205:3 Cf. Yt. II, 15.

[^972]: 205:4 A generic name of the people called elsewhere Varedhakas (Yt. IX, 31; XVII, 51) or _H__v_yaonas (ibid. and XIX, 87). The Hunus have been compared with the Hunni; but it is not certain that this is a proper name; it may be a disparaging denomination, meaning the brood (hunu = Sansk. sûnu; cf. Yt. X, 113).

[^973]: 205:5 Zarîr, the brother of Vî_s_tâspa and son of Aurva_t_\-aspa (see Yt. V, 112). The ten following seem to be the names of the other sons of Aurva_t_\-aspa (Bund. XXXI, 29).

[^974]: 205:6 Possibly the same with Pât-Khosrav, a brother to Vî_s_tâspa in the Yâ_d_kâr-î Zarîrân, as Mr. West informs me.

[^975]: 206:1 Gustahm, the son of Nodar; see Yt. V, 76. Strangely enough, Tusa is not mentioned here, unless he is the same with one of the preceding names: possibly the words ‘the son of Naotara’ (Naotairyâna) refer to all the four.

[^976]: 206:2 Possibly Frashîdvard ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/20600.jpg) (misspelt from a Pahlavi form Fra_s_ânvard ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/20601.jpg) (?); the Yâ_d_kâr-î Zarîrân, as Mr. West informs me, has ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/20602.jpg) and ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/20603.jpg)). Frashîdvard was a son of Gu_s_tâsp: he was killed by one of Ar_g_âsp's heroes and avenged by his brother Isfendyâr (Spe_ñ_tô-dâta). The following names would belong to his brothers: most of them contain the word Âtar, in honour of the newly-adopted worship of fire.

[^977]: 207:1 Isfendyâr, the heroic son of Gû_s_tâsp, killed by Rustem.

[^978]: 207:2 In the Yâ_d_kâr-î Zarîrân, according to Mr. West, Bastvar, the son of Zairivairi, whose death he avenges on his murderer Vîdraf_s_. This makes Bastavairi identical with the Nastûr ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/20700.jpg) of Firdausi (read Bastûr ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/20701.jpg)).

[^979]: 207:3 Kavârazem is the Gurezm of later tradition ( ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/20702.jpg)), ‘the jealous brother of Isfendyâr, whom he slandered to his father and caused to be thrown into prison’ (Burhân qâti’h). Firdausi (IV, 432) has only that he was a relation to Gû_s_tâsp: ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/20703.jpg). See Études Iraniennes, II, 230.

[^980]: 207:4 Who gave his daughter, Hvôvi, in marriage to Zarathu_s_tra (Yasna L \[XLIX\], 4, 17).

[^981]: 207:5 See Yt. V, 68.

[^982]: 208:1 Another brother to Frashao_s_tra (?).

[^983]: 208:2 The son of _G_âmâsp in the Shâh Nâmah is called Girâmî and Garâmîk-kar_d_ in the Yâ_d_kâr-î Zarîrân.

[^984]: 208:3 ? Aoiwra.

[^985]: 208:4 Aêthrapati, in Parsi hêrbad, a priest, whose special function is to teach; his pupils were called aêthrya. Aêthrapati meant literally ‘the master of the hearth’ (cf. hêrkodah, fire-temple). Hamidhpati is literally ‘the master of the sacrificial log.’

[^986]: 208:5 Doubtful.

[^987]: 208:6 No temporal lord (ahu) and no spiritual master (ratu).

[^988]: 208:7 Doubtful (avas_k_asta-fravashinãm).

[^989]: 208:8 The evil done by Zoroastrians. This Mãthravâka (‘Proclaimer p. 209 of the Holy Word’) was apparently a great doctor and confounder of heresies.

[^990]: 209:1 See above, § 95.

[^991]: 209:2 Possibly the eponym of that great Kâren family, which played so great a part in the history of the Sassanian times, and traced its origin to the time of Gû_s_tâsp (Noeldeke, Geschichte der Perser zur Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 437).

[^992]: 209:3 Cf. Yt. V, 64.

[^993]: 209:4 Cf. Yt. XIII, 99.

[^995]: 210:1 Amru and _K_amru are apparently the two mythical birds mentioned above under the names of Sîn-amru (the Amru-falcon) and _K_ãmrô_s_ ([p. 173](Yasts_12#p173), note [1](Yasts_12#fn795)).

[^997]: 210:2 Mr. West compares Ashâvanghu, the son of Biva_n_dangha, and _G_arôdanghu, the son of Pairi_s_tîra, with the two high-priests of the Karshvares of Arezahi and Savahi, whose names are, in the p. 211 Bundahi_s_, Ashâshagaha_d_\-ê _H__v_a_n_d_k_ân and Hoazarôdathhri-ê Parê_s_tyarô (Bund. XXIX, 1, notes 4 and 5).

[^998]: 211:1 Saoshya_n__t_; cf. §§ 117, 128.

[^999]: 211:2 Possibly, ‘the holy Hãm-baretar vanghvãm, the son of Takhma.’ His name means, ‘the gatherer of good things.’

[^1000]: 211:3 This name means, ‘the praiser of excellent holiness’ (the reciter of the Ashem Vohû).

[^1001]: 211:4 See preceding paragraph.

[^1002]: 212:1 One of the seven immortals, rulers in _H__v_aniratha; cf. Yt. V, 72, text and notes, and Yt. XIII, 120, 124.

[^1003]: 212:2 See preceding paragraph.

[^1004]: 212:3 See Yt. V, 72. The text has ‘the Fravashi;’ cf. Yt. V, 116, note, and Yt. XIII, 115.

[^1005]: 212:4 Cf. Yt. XIII, 143. Possibly, the son of Tûra.

[^1006]: 212:5 Cf. § 112.

[^1007]: 213:1 There are two men of this name; one is the son of Katu (§ 114), the other is the son of Avârao_s_tri (§ 104).

[^1008]: 213:2 The text has ‘the Fravashi;’ cf. preceding page, note [^957].

[^1009]: 213:3 See § 105.

[^1010]: 215:1 Saoshya_n__t_; cf. §§ 110, 128.

[^1011]: 215:2 Perhaps, Ukhshan, the conqueror of glory, known afar, son of Berezva_n__t_.

[^1012]: 216:1 One of the immortals, rulers in _H__v_aniratha: he is said to belong to the Fryâna family (Dâdistân XC, 3); he resides in the district of the river Nâîvtâk (Bund. XXIX, 5).

[^1013]: 216:2 See Yt. V, 81.

[^1014]: 216:3 Paitisrîra is perhaps an epithet (most beautiful?), added to distinguish Paêshatah from the hero mentioned in § 115.

[^1015]: 216:4 An allusion to some legend of domestic feud of which Paêshatah was the hero.

[^1016]: 216:5 The high-priest of the Fradadhafshu Karshvare (Spîtoî_d_\-i Aûspôsînân; Bund. XXIX, 1; tr. West, note 6).

[^1017]: 216:6 The high-priest of the Vîdadhafshu Karshvare (Aîrî_z_\-râsp Aûspôsînân; see ibid., note 7).

[^1019]: 216:7 Cf. §128.

[^1020]: 217:1 Probably the same with Huvâsp, the high-priest in the Vourubare_s_ti Karshvare (Bund. XXIX, 1; tr. West, note 8).

[^1021]: 217:2 Possibly the same with the high-priest in the Vouru-_g_are_s_ti karshvare, _K_akhravâk (ibid., note 9). _K_akhravâk is the generic name of the bird Karshipta (Pahl. Comm. ad II, 42 \[139\]); it must stand here by mistake for _K_ahârâsp.

[^1022]: 217:3 Or, ‘the Turanian;’ cf. § 113.

[^1023]: 218:1 The text has ‘the Fravashi;’ cf. §§ 113, 127.

[^1030]: 219:1 See Études Iraniennes, II, 142.

[^1028]: 219:2 The text has ‘the Fravashi;’ cf. § 113.

[^1031]: 219:3 Different from _G_âmâspa, the son of Hvôva (§ 103).

[^1032]: 219:4 Different from Maidhyô-m_a_ungha, the son of Arâsti (§ 95).

[^1033]: 219:5 Different from. Urvata_t_\-nara, the son of Zarathu_s_tra (§ 98).

[^1034]: 220:1 The six foremost helpers of Saoshya_n__t_, each in one of the six Karshvares: ‘It is said that in the fifty-seven years, which are the period of the raising of the dead, Rôshanô-_k_ashm in Arzâh, Khûr-_k_ashm in Savâh, Frâda_d_\-gadman (Frâda_t_\-_h__v_arenô, Increaser of Glory) in Frada_d_âfsh, Vâreda_d_\-gadman (Vareda_t_\-_h__v_arenô, Multiplier of Glory) in Vîda_d_âfsh, Kâmak-vakhshi_s_n (Vouru-nemô, Prayer-loving) in Vôrûbar_s_t, and Kâmak-sû_d_ (Vouru-savô, Weal-loving) in Vôrû-_g_ar_s_t, while Sôshâns in the illustrious and pure Khvanîras is connected with them, are immortal. The completely good sense, perfect hearing, and full glory of those seven producers of the renovation are so miraculous that they converse from region unto region, every one together with the six others’ (Dâdistân XXXVI, 5-6; tr. West).

[^1035]: 220:2 The first brother and forerunner to Saoshya_n__t_, the Oshedar mâh of later tradition (see above, [p. 196](#p196), note [^881]; cf. § 141, note).

[^1036]: 220:3 The second brother and forerunner to Saoshya_n__t_, the Oshedar bâmî of later tradition (ibid.; cf. § 142, note).

[^1037]: 220:4 Saoshya_n__t_; cf. following paragraph and §§ 110; 117.

[^1038]: 221:1 He will suppress both the destructive power of the men of the Dru_g_ (idolaters and the like) and the errors of Mazdayasnians (?).

[^1039]: 221:2 See above, [p. 25](Yasts_1#p25), note [4](Yasts_1#fn117).

[^1040]: 221:3 Vouru-vãthwa; cf. Études Iraniennes, II, 182.

[^1041]: 221:4 As he made waters and trees undrying, cattle and men undying.

[^1042]: 221:5 See above, [p. 61](Yasts_5#p61), note [1](Yasts_5#fn305).

[^1043]: 221:6 As the inventor of medicine; see Vend. XX, Introd.

[^1044]: 221:7 Disease, being a poison, comes from the Serpent; see ibid.

[^1045]: 221:8 Or ‘Aoshnara, full of wisdom;’ cf. Yt. XXIII, 2, and West, Pahlavi Texts, II, 171, note 3.

[^1046]: 221:9 Called in the Shah Nâmah Zab, son of Tahmâsp, who appears to have been a son of Nodar (Bund. XXXI, 23).

[^1047]: 222:1 See above, [p. 114](Yasts_9#p114), note [7](Yasts_9#fn545) (Yt. IX, 18).

[^1048]: 222:2 Airyu, the youngest of the three sons of Thraêtaona (seep. 61, note i), was killed by his brothers and avenged by his son Manu_s_\-_k_ithra, who succeeded Thraêtaona.

[^1049]: 222:3 Kavâta, Kai Qobâd in the Shâh Nâmah, an adoptive son to Uzava, according to Bund. XXXI, 24.

[^1050]: 222:4 Kaî-Apîveh in the Bundahi_s_; he was the son of Kai Qobâd.

[^1054]: 222:5 Usadhan, Arshan, Pisanah, and Byârshan were the four sons of Aipivanghu; they are called in Firdausi Kai Kaus, Kai Arish, Kai Pashîn, and Kai Armin. Kai Kaus alone came to the throne.

[^1056]: 222:6 Syâvakhsh and Khosrav; see above, [p. 64](Yasts_5#p64), note [1](Yasts_5#fn315).

[^1057]: 222:7 To become possessed of Strength, Victory, &c., as Husravah did.

[^1058]: 223:1 Like Frangrasyan; cf. [p. 64](Yasts_5#p64), note [1](Yasts_5#fn315).

[^1059]: 223:2 See Yt. V, 37; XV, 27; XIX, 38.

[^1060]: 223:3 Belonging to the Sâma family (Yasna IX, 10).

[^1061]: 223:4 Like the nine highwaymen killed by Keresâspa, Yt. XIX, 41.

[^1062]: 223:5 Not mentioned in the Shâh Nâmah; Khosrav was succeeded by a distant relation, Lôhrasp.

[^1063]: 223:6 An allusion to the lost legend of Âkhrûra; see, however, West, Pahlavi Texts, II, 375.

[^1064]: 224:1 See Yt. V, 21-23.

[^1065]: 224:2 Khumbya, one of the immortals in _H__v_aniratha; he resides in the Pê_s_yânsaî plain: ‘he is _H__v_embya for this reason, because they brought him up in a _h__v_emb (jar) for fear of Khashm’ (Bund. XXIX, 5). He answers pretty well to the Agastya and Vasish_th_a of the Vedic legend (see Ormazd et Ahriman, § 177).

[^1066]: 224:3 One of the three wives of Zarathu_s_tra, the daughter of Frashao_s_tra; she is the supposed mother of Saoshya_n__t_ and his brothers (see [p. 195](#p195), note [^878]).

[^1067]: 224:4 The three daughters of Zarathu_s_tra and sisters to Isa_d_vâstar (see [p. 204](#p204), note [^921]).

[^1075]: 225:6 Ibid.

[^1076]: 226:1 Ukhshya_t_\-ereta's mother (see above, § 126); the Saddar Bundahi_s_ (Études Iraniennes, II, 209) calls her Bad, from the last part of her name (fedhri for padhri, and states that, bathing in Lake Kãsava, she will become pregnant from the seed of Zarathu_s_tra, that is preserved there (see above, [p. 195](#p195), note [^878]), and she will bring forth a son, Oshedar bâmî.

[^1077]: 226:2 Ukhshya_t_\-nemah's mother, called Vah Bad in the Saddar; she will conceive in the same way as Srûta_t_\-fedhri.

[^1078]: 226:3 Saoshya_n__t_'s mother.

[^1079]: 226:4 Cf. Vend. XIX, 5, and Introd. IV, 39-40.

[^1080]: 226:5 Gôgô_s_asp (a commentator to the Avesta) says, ‘There are holy men in all religions, as appears from the words tûiryanãm da_h__v_yunãm \[We worship the Fravashis of the holy men in the Turanian countries\],’ (Pahl. Comm. ad Vend. III, end; and Vend. V, 38 \[122\]); cf. above, §§ 113, 123.

[^1081]: 226:6 The countries inherited by Sairima (Seim), the third son of p. 227 Thraêtaona, as Turan and Iran were inherited by Tûra and Airyu. Selm's heritage was Rûm, that is to say, Europa and Western Asia.

[^1082]: 227:1 China (Bund. XV, 29).

[^1083]: 227:2 Perhaps the Dahae (Pliny VI, 17; Aeneis VIII, 728) or Δάαι (Strabo), called Ta-hia by Chinese geographers, on the south of the Oxus.

[^1084]: 227:3 From the first man to the last.

[^1085]: 228:1 Itinerant priests are received here.

[^1086]: 228:2 Doubtful.

[^1087]: 228:3 Cf. [p. 198](#p198), note [^887].

[^1088]: 228:4 The Paoiryô-_t_kaê_s_as; see [p. 180](#p180), note [^810].

[^1090]: 228:5 For the triumph of the Zoroastrian law.

[^1091]: 229:1 Daitika, Persian ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/22900.jpg); Neriosengh has ‘that go by herds,’ paṅkti_k_ârin. Aidyu; the Pahlavi translation has ayyâr, ‘that are of help’ (domesticated?); Neriosengh has misread it as suvâr and translated açvacârin. The expression daitika aidyu answers to the Persian ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/22901.jpg), meaning all sorts of animals (see Études Iraniennes, II, 150).

[^1092]: 230:1 Who shall worship the Fravashis.
