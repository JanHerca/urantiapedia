These two Ya<i>s</i>ts or Ya<i>s</i>t fragments are known among the Parsis as the Hâdhôkht Nask, though their context does not correspond to any part of the description of that Nask as given in the Dîn-kart (West, Pahlavi Texts, I, 224, note 8). A Pahlavi translation of these Ya<i>s</i>ts has been edited by Haug and West (The Book of Ardâ Vîrâf, p. 269 seq.).

## XXI. YA<i>S</i>T FRAGMENT.

Ya<i>s</i>t XXI is a eulogy of the Ashem Vohû prayer, the value of which rises higher and higher, according as the circumstances under which it is being recited are of greater importance.

1\. Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!

2\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the praise of Holiness [^1325], O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!

3\. 'He who recites the praise of Holiness [^1325], in the fulness of faith and with a devoted heart, praises me, Ahura Mazda; he praises the waters, he praises the earth, he praises the cattle, he praises the plants, he praises all good things made by Mazda, all the things that are the offspring of the good principle.

4\. 'For the reciting of that word of truth, O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! the pronouncing of that formula, the Ahuna Vairya, increases strength and victory in one's soul and piety. <span id="p312">[<sup><small>p. 312</small></sup>]</span> 5\. ‘For that only recital of the praise of Holiness is worth a hundred khshnaothras of the beings of Holiness [^1326], when delivered while going to sleep, a thousand when delivered after eating, ten thousand when delivered during cohabitation, or any number when delivered in departing this life.’

6\. 'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth ten others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?

7\. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is that one, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! that a man delivers when eating the gifts of Haurvatâ<i>t</i> and Ameretâ<i>t</i> [^1327], at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.’

8\. ‘What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth a hundred others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?’

9\. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is that one, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! that a man delivers while drinking of the Haoma strained for the sacrifice, at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.’

10\. ‘What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth a thousand others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?’

11\. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is that one, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! that a man delivers when starting <span id="p313">[<sup><small>p. 313</small></sup>]</span> up from his bed or going to sleep again, at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.’

12\. ‘What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth ten thousand others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?’

13\. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is that one, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! that a man delivers when waking up and rising from sleep, at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.’

14\. ‘What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth this Karshvare of ours, <i>H</i><i>v</i>aniratha [^1328], with its cattle and its chariots, without its men, in greatness, goodness, and fairness?’

15\. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is that one, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! that a man delivers in the last moments of his life, at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.’

16\. ‘What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth all that is between the earth and the heavens, and this earth, and that luminous space, and all the good things made by Mazda, that are the offspring of the good principle in greatness, goodness, and fairness?’

17\. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is that one, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! that a man delivers to renounce evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds [^1329].’
