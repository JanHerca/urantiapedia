Only the first two sections of this Ya<i>s</i>t refer to its nominal object, Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, the Genius of Health and Waters (Vend. Introd. IV, 7, 33). The rest of the Ya<i>s</i>t refers to the performance of the Bareshnûm ceremony as being the test of the true Zoroastrian. As the Bareshnûm purification was performed by Airyaman to drive away the myriads of diseases created by Angra Mainyu [^249], its laudation is not quite unaptly inserted in a Ya<i>s</i>t devoted to the Genius of Health.

The Khordâd Ya<i>s</i>t can be recited at any time. It is better to recite it during the Gâh U<i>s</i>ahin, on the day Khordâd (Anquetil).

The text is corrupt.

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, one who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\], the holy and master of holiness [^250] . . . . .

Unto Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, the master; unto the prosperity <span id="p49"><sup><small>[ p. 49 ]</small></sup></span> of the seasons and unto the years, the masters of holiness [^251],

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

We sacrifice unto Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>ta; we sacrifice unto the prosperity of the seasons; we sacrifice unto the years, the holy and masters of holiness [^252].

1\. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, saying: 'I created for the faithful the help, the enjoyments, the comforts, and the pleasures of Haurvatâ<i>t</i>. We unite them with him who would come up to thee as one of the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas, as he would come to any of the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas, Vohu-Manô, Asha-Vahi<i>s</i>ta, Khshathra-Vairya, Spe<i>n</i>ta-Ârmaiti, Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, and Ameretâ<i>t</i>.

2\. 'He who against the thousands of thousands of those Daêvas, against their ten thousands of ten thousands, against their numberless myriads would invoke the name of Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, as one of the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas, he would smite the Nasu, he would smite Ha<i>s</i>i [^253], he would smite Ba<i>s</i>i [^253], he would smite Saêni [^253], he would smite Bû<i>g</i>i [^253].

3 [^254]. 'I proclaim the faithful man as the first \[of men\]; if I proclaim the faithful man as the first <span id="p50"><sup><small>[ p. 50 ]</small></sup></span> \[of men\] [^255], then Rashnu Razi<i>s</i>ta [^256], then every heavenly Yazata of male nature in company with the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas will free the faithful man [^257]

4\. 'From the Nasu, from Ha<i>s</i>i, from Ga<i>s</i>i [^258], from Saêni, from Bû<i>g</i>i; from the hordes with the wide front, from the hordes with the many spears uplifted, from the evil man who oppresses, from the wilful sinner [^259], from the oppressor of men, from the Yâtu, from the Pairika, from the straying way.

5\. ‘How does the way of the faithful turn and part from the way of the wicked [^260]?’

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is when a man pronouncing my spell, either reading [^261] or reciting it by heart, draws the furrows [^262] and hides [^263] there himself, \[saying\]:

6\. “I will smite thee, O Dru<i>g</i>! whomsoever thou art, whomsoever thou art amongst the Dru<i>g</i>es that come in an open way, whomsoever thou art amongst the Dru<i>g</i>es that come by hidden ways, whomsoever thou art amongst the Dru<i>g</i>es that defile by contact; whatsoever Dru<i>g</i> thou art, I smite thee away from the Aryan countries; whatsoever Dru<i>g</i> thou art, I bind thee; I smite thee down, O Dru<i>g</i>! I throw thee down below, O Dru<i>g</i>!” <span id="p51"><sup><small>[ p. 51 ]</small></sup></span> 7\. 'He draws \[then\] three furrows [^264]: I proclaim him one of the faithful; he draws six furrows [^264]: I proclaim him one of the faithful; he draws nine furrows [^264]: I proclaim him one of the faithful.

8\. 'The names of those (Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas) smite the men turned to Nasus [^265] by the Dru<i>g</i>es; the seed and kin of the deaf [^266] are smitten, the scornful [^267] are dead, as the Zaotar Zarathu<i>s</i>tra blows them away to woe [^268], however fierce, at his will and wish, as many as he wishes.

9\. 'From the time when the sun is down he smites them with bruising blows; from the time when the sun is no longer up, he deals deadly blows on the Nasu with his club struck down, for the propitiation and glorification of the heavenly gods.

10\. 'O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! let not that spell be shown to any one, except by the father to his son, or by the brother to his brother from the same womb, or by the Âthravan to his pupil [^269] in black hair, devoted to the good law, who, devoted to the good law, holy [^270] and brave, stills all the Dru<i>g</i>es [^271].

11\. 'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard, namely, unto Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>ta. Unto Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>ta, we offer up the libations, the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the tongue, the <span id="p52"><sup><small>[ p. 52 ]</small></sup></span> holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations, and the rightly-spoken words.

12\. 'Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

‘I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of Haurvatâ<i>t</i>, the master; of the prosperity of the seasons and of the years, the masters of holiness.

‘Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good. . . . .

‘\[Give\] unto that man [^272]’ brightness and glory, . . . . give him the bright, all happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.’

[^251]: 49:1 Sîrôzah I, 6.

[^252]: 49:2 Sîrôzah II, 6.

[^253]: 49:3 Names of Daêvas. According to the Parsi translator of the Dînkart (vol. ii, p. 65), Ha<i>s</i>i is ‘he who makes sceptical;’ Ba<i>s</i>i is ‘he who gives rise to the barking disease;’ Saêni is ‘he who causes harm;’ Bû<i>g</i>i is ‘he who preys upon.’

[^254]: 49:4 The translation of this paragraph is quite conjectural.

[^255]: 50:1 If I am one of the faithful.

[^256]: 50:2 The Genius of Truth, Yt. XII.

[^257]: 50:3 Will free me as one of the faithful.

[^260]: 50:6 How is the wicked known from the faithful one?

[^261]: 50:7 Marâo: Phl. ô<i>s</i>môrît, Sansk. adhyeti; safarûnît, poshayati (pustakayati? Yasna XIX, 6 \[9\]).

[^262]: 50:8 The furrows for the Bareshnûm purification (Vend. IX).

[^263]: 50:9 Doubtful: gaozaiti; read yaozdâiti (? he cleanses).

[^267]: 51:4 Sao<i>k</i>a; cf. Yt. XXII, 13.

[^268]: 51:5 Du<i>z</i>avâ<i>t</i>: both the reading and the meaning are doubtful. Mr. West suggests, ‘sends to hell’ (reading du<i>z</i>anghvâ<i>t</i> or du<i>z</i>angha<i>t</i>).

[^269]: 51:6 Doubtful.

[^270]: 51:7 Reading ashava instead of asô ava.

[^271]: 51:8 Cf. Yt. XIV, 46.
