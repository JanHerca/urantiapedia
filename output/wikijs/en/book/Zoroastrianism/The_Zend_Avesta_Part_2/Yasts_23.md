XXIII-XXIV. ÂFRÎN PAIGHAMBAR ZARTÛ<i>S</i>T AND VÎ<i>S</i>TÂSP YA<i>S</i>T.

‘God taught the Zendávasta to Zartusht—a sublime work . . . . God said to Zartusht, “Go and before Sháh Gushtásp read this book, that he may come into the faith . . . . keep all my counsel and repeat it word by word to Sháh Gushtásp [^1359].” ’

Zartusht, in obedience to God, went to the court of Gushtásp: ‘He came forward and called down a blessing on the Shâh [^1360].’ Then he read to him the Zandávasta and said: ‘Learn its statutes and walk therein. If your desire is towards its laws, your abode shall be in the paradise of heaven. But if you turn away from its commandments, you shall bring down your crowned head to the dust. Your God will be displeased with you, and will overthrow your prosperous condition. At the last you shall descend into hell, if you hear not the counsel of the Almighty [^1361].’

These lines of the Zartusht-Namah are a summary of the following two Ya<i>s</i>ts. The first, entitled ‘The blessing of the prophet Zartû<i>s</i>t,’ contains the words of blessing addressed by Zarathu<i>s</i>tra when appearing before the king. These words seem to have followed a similar blessing pronounced by <i>G</i>âmâspa [^1362], the prime minister of Vî<i>s</i>tâspa [^1363].

Ya<i>s</i>t XXIV contains the exhortations of the prophet to the king to follow and closely adhere to the Law of Mazda. It is a counterpart to the XIXth Fargard of the Vendîdâd, as Zarathu<i>s</i>tra plays here the same part to Vî<i>s</i>tâspa as Ahura does there to Zarathu<i>s</i>tra. It is, therefore, a summary of the Law, of the duties it <span id="p325"><sup><small>[ p. 325 ]</small></sup></span> enforces and of the rewards it promises. This accounts for the strange disconnection apparent in it, which makes it a crux interpretum, as, besides the very corrupt state of the text, the chief difficulty of this Ya<i>s</i>t arises from the fact that many passages in it are incomplete quotations from the Vendîdâd, or allusions to statements therein [^1364], which, when supplied, help a good deal to relieve this Ya<i>s</i>t from its apparent state of utter incoherence.

For this translation I was able to avail myself of a Pahlavi translation, of which a copy was kindly lent to me by Mr. West. That translation is apparently of late date and often manifestly wrong; yet it was very useful to me in several passages, besides its giving a Zend text generally more correct and more correctly divided than the text in Westergaard's edition [^1365].

Ya<i>s</i>t XXIII was originally no independent Ya<i>s</i>t, being nothing more than the beginning of Ya<i>s</i>t XXIV, detached from it, with one slight alterations and inversions.

‘Mayest thou be able to reach the Rangha, whose shores lie afar, as Vafra Navâza was [^1376]!

In three of them mayest thou be an Âthravan! In three of them mayest thou be a warrior! In three of them mayest thou be a tiller of the ground [^1379]! And may one be like thyself, O Vî<i>s</i>tâspa!

6\. 'Mayest thou be swift-horsed, like the Sun [^1380]!

‘Mayest thou be resplendent, like the moon!

‘Mayest thou be hot-burning, like fire!

‘Mayest thou have piercing rays, like Mithra!

‘Mayest thou be tall-formed and victorious, like the devout Sraosha [^1381]!

7\. 'Mayest thou follow a law of truth, like Rashnu [^1382]!

‘Mayest thou be a conqueror of thy foes, like Verethraghna [^1383], made by Ahura!

‘Mayest thou have fulness of welfare, like Râma <i>H</i><i>v</i>âstra [^1384]!

‘Mayest thou be freed from sickness and death, like king Husravah [^1385]!

8\. 'Then the blessing goes for the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones [^1386].

‘May it happen unto thee according to my blessing!

‘ [^1387] Let us embrace and propagate the good thoughts, good words, and good deeds that have been done and that will be done here and elsewhere, that we may be in the number of the good.

<span id="p328"><sup><small>[ p. 328 ]</small></sup></span>

‘Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

‘Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

‘\[Give\] unto that man brightness and glory, . . . . give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.’
