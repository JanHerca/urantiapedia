A Nyâyi<i>s</i> is properly a begging prayer, as opposed to Sitâyi<i>s</i>, a prayer of praise. It is a term particularly applied to five prayers addressed to the Sun, to Mithra, to the Moon, to Waters, and to Fire. Every layman over eight years old is bound to recite the Nyâyi<i>s</i>: he recites it standing and girded with his Kôstî.

The Sun Nyâyi<i>s</i> is recited three times a day, at the rising of the sun (Gâh Hâvan), at noon (Gâh Rapitvin), and at three o'clock in the afternoon (Gâh Uzîren). The Mithra Nyâyi<i>s</i> is recited with the Sun Nyâyi<i>s</i>, as Mithra follows the sun in its course (see Yt. X, 13).

The Moon Nyâyi<i>s</i> is recited three times a month: first, at the time when it begins to be seen; second, when it is at the full; third, when it is on the wane.

The Waters Nyâyi<i>s</i> and the Fire Nyâyi<i>s</i> are recited every day, when one finds oneself in the proximity of those elements. The Fire Nyâyi<i>s</i> is recited with the Penôm on (see Vend. p. 168, 7).

The first four Nyâyi<i>s</i> must be recited especially on the days over which the Izads invoked preside; that is to say, on the Khôrshê<i>d</i>, Mihir, Mâh, and Âbân days (the eleventh, sixteenth, twelfth, and tenth days of the month) [^1499].

Hail unto thee, O Ahura Mazda, in the threefold way [^1501]! \[Hail unto thee\] before all other creatures!

Hail unto you, O Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas, who are all of you of one accord with the Sun!

May I grow in health of body through Vohu-Manô, Khshathra, and Asha, and come to that luminous space, to that highest of all high things [^1507], when the world, O Spe<i>n</i>ta Mainyu! has come to an end!

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

6\. We sacrifice unto the bright, undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun.

We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, who is truth-speaking, a chief in assemblies, with a thousand ears, well-shapen, with ten thousand eyes, high, with full knowledge, strong, sleepless, and ever awake [^1508].

So may Mithra and Ahura, the two great gods, come to us for help!

We sacrifice unto the bright, undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun.

We sacrifice unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the holy Ones.

We sacrifice unto the bright, undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun.

10\. I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra . . . .

<span id="p353">[<sup><small>p. 353</small></sup>]</span>

Unto the bright, undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun;

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification . . . . [^1516]

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

\[We sacrifice\] unto the Ahurian waters [^1517], the waters of Ahura, with excellent libations, with finest libations, with libations piously strained [^1518].

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

\[Give\] unto that man brightness and glory, give him health of body, . . . . give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.
