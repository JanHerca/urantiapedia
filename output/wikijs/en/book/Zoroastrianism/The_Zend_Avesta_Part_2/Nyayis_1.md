A Nyâyi_s_ is properly a begging prayer, as opposed to Sitâyi_s_, a prayer of praise. It is a term particularly applied to five prayers addressed to the Sun, to Mithra, to the Moon, to Waters, and to Fire. Every layman over eight years old is bound to recite the Nyâyi_s_: he recites it standing and girded with his Kôstî.

The Sun Nyâyi_s_ is recited three times a day, at the rising of the sun (Gâh Hâvan), at noon (Gâh Rapitvin), and at three o'clock in the afternoon (Gâh Uzîren). The Mithra Nyâyi_s_ is recited with the Sun Nyâyi_s_, as Mithra follows the sun in its course (see Yt. X, 13).

The Moon Nyâyi_s_ is recited three times a month: first, at the time when it begins to be seen; second, when it is at the full; third, when it is on the wane.

The Waters Nyâyi_s_ and the Fire Nyâyi_s_ are recited every day, when one finds oneself in the proximity of those elements. The Fire Nyâyi_s_ is recited with the Penôm on (see Vend. p. 168, 7).

The first four Nyâyi_s_ must be recited especially on the days over which the Izads invoked preside; that is to say, on the Khôrshê_d_, Mihir, Mâh, and Âbân days (the eleventh, sixteenth, twelfth, and tenth days of the month) [^1499].

Hail unto thee, O Ahura Mazda, in the threefold way [^1501]! \[Hail unto thee\] before all other creatures!

May I grow in health of body through Vohu-Manô, Khshathra, and Asha, and come to that luminous space, to that highest of all high things [^1507], when the world, O Spe_n_ta Mainyu! has come to an end!

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

6\. We sacrifice unto the bright, undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun.

We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, who is truth-speaking, a chief in assemblies, with a thousand ears, well-shapen, with ten thousand eyes, high, with full knowledge, strong, sleepless, and ever awake [^1508].

10\. I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu_s_tra . . . .

<span id="p353">[<sup><small>p. 353</small></sup>]</span>

Unto the bright, undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun;

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification . . . . [^1516]

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

\[We sacrifice\] unto the Ahurian waters [^1517], the waters of Ahura, with excellent libations, with finest libations, with libations piously strained [^1518].

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

\[Give\] unto that man brightness and glory, give him health of body, . . . . give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.
