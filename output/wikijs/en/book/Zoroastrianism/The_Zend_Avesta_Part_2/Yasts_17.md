Ashi Vanguhi or ‘the good Ashi [^1150]’ is a feminine impersonation of piety [^1151], and she is, at the same time, the source of all the good and riches that are connected with piety [^1152]. She is described, therefore, as a goddess of Fortune and Wealth, and is invoked in company with Pâre<i>n</i>di, the goddess of Treasures (Sîrôzah 25).

She appears in the latter character in the first part of the Ya<i>s</i>t (§§ 1-14); she praises and loves Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (§§ 15-21). She is worshipped by Hao<i>s</i>yangha (§ 26), Yima (§ 28), Thraêtaona (§33), Haoma (§ 37), Husravah (§ 41), Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (§ 45), and Vî<i>s</i>tâspa (§ 49) [^1153]. She rejects the offerings of all sterile people (old men, courtezans, and children, §§ 53-61).

## I.

1\. We sacrifice to Ashi Vanguhi, who is shining, high, tall-formed, well worthy of sacrifice, with a loud-sounding chariot, strong, welfare-giving, healing, with fulness of intellect [^1154], and powerful;

2\. The daughter of Ahura Mazda, the sister of the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas, who endows all the <span id="p271"><sup><small>[ p. 271 ]</small></sup></span> Saoshya<i>n</i><i>t</i>s [^1155] with the enlivening intelligence; she also brings heavenly wisdom at her wish, and comes to help him who invokes her from near and him who invokes her from afar, and worships her with offerings of libations.

3 [^1156]. For her brightness and glory, I will offer her a sacrifice worth being heard; I will offer up unto Ashi Vanguhi a good sacrifice with an offering of libations. We sacrifice unto Ashi Vanguhi with the libations; with the Haoma and meat, with the baresma, with the wisdom of the tongue, with the holy spells, with the words, with the deeds, with the libations, and with the rightly-spoken words.

Yê<i>n</i>hê hâtãm: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda . . . .

## II.

4\. We sacrifice to Ashi Vanguhi, who is shining, high, tall-formed, well worthy of sacrifice, with a loud-sounding chariot, strong, welfare-giving, healing, with fulness of intellect, and powerful.

5\. Homage unto Haoma, and unto the Mãthra [^1157], and unto the holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!

Homage unto Haoma, because all other drinks are attended with Aêshma [^1158], the fiend of the wounding spear: but the drinking of Haoma is attended with Asha and with Ashi Vanguhi herself [^1159].

6\. Ashi is fair; Ashi is radiant with joy; she is far-piercing with her rays. Ashi gives good Glory <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> unto those men whom thou dost follow, O Ashi! Full of perfumes is the house in which the good, powerful Ashi Vanguhi puts her . . . . [^1160] feet, for long friendship.

7\. Those men whom thou dost attend, O Ashi! are kings of kingdoms, that are rich in horses, with large tributes, with snorting horses, sounding chariots, flashing swords, rich in aliments and in stores of food [^1161]; well-scented where the beds are spread and full of all the other riches that may be wished for. Happy the man whom thou dost attend! do thou attend me, thou rich in all sorts of desirable things and strong!

8\. Those men whom thou dost attend, O Ashi Vanguhi! have houses that stand well laid up, rich in cattle, foremost in Asha, and long-supported. Happy the man whom thou dost attend! Do thou attend me, thou rich in all sorts of desirable things and strong!

9\. The men whom thou dost attend, O Ashi Vanguhi! have beds that stand well-spread, well-adorned, well-made, provided with cushions and with feet inlaid with gold. Happy the man whom thou dost attend! Do thou attend me, thou rich in all sorts of desirable things and strong!

10\. The men whom thou dost attend, O Ashi Vanguhi! have their ladies that sit on their beds, waiting for them: they lie on the cushions, adorning themselves, . . . . [^1162], with square bored ear-rings and a necklace of gold: ‘When will our lord come? when shall we enjoy in our bodies the joys of love?’ <span id="p273"><sup><small>[ p. 273 ]</small></sup></span> Happy the man whom thou dost attend! Do thou attend me, thou rich in all sorts of desirable things and strong!

11\. The men whom thou dost attend, O Ashi Vanguhi! have daughters that sit . . . . [^1163]; thin is their waist, beautiful is their body, long are their fingers; they are as fair of shape as those who look on can wish. Happy the man whom thou dost attend! Do thou attend me, thou rich in all sorts of desirable things and strong!

12\. The men whom thou dost attend, O Ashi Vanguhi! have horses swift and loud-neighing; they drive the chariot lightly, they take it to the battle [^1164], they bear a gallant praiser (of the gods), who has many horses, a solid chariot, a sharp spear, a long spear, and swift arrows, who hits his aim, pursuing after his enemies, and smiting his foes. Happy the man whom thou dost attend! Do thou attend me, thou rich in all sorts of desirable things and strong!

13\. The men whom thou dost attend, O Ashi Vanguhi! have large-humped, burden-bearing camels, flying from the ground or fighting with holy fieriness [^1165]. Happy the man whom thou dost attend! Do thou attend me, thou rich in all sorts of desirable things and strong!

14\. The men whom thou dost attend, O Ashi Vanguhi! have hoards of silver and gold brought together from far distant regions; and garments of splendid make. Happy the man whom thou dost attend! Do thou attend me, thou rich in all sorts of desirable things and strong! <span id="p274"><sup><small>[ p. 274 ]</small></sup></span> 15\. Do not turn thy look from me! turn thy mercy towards me, O great Ashi! thou art well-made and of a noble seed [^1166]; thou art sovereign at thy wish; thou art Glory in a bodily form.

16\. Thy father is Ahura Mazda, the greatest of all gods, the best of all gods; thy mother is Ârmaiti Spe<i>n</i>ta; thy brothers are Sraosha [^1167], a god of Asha, and Rashnu [^1168], tall and strong, and Mithra [^1169], the lord of wide pastures, who has ten thousand spies and a thousand ears; thy sister is the Law of the worshippers of Mazda.

17\. Praised of the gods, unoffended by the righteous [^1170], the great Ashi Vanguhi stood up on her chariot, thus speaking: ‘Who art thou who dost invoke me, whose voice is to my ear the sweetest of all that invoked me most?’

18\. And he [^1171] said aloud: 'I am Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, who, first of mortals, recited the praise of the excellent Asha [^1172] and offered up sacrifice unto Ahura Mazda and the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas; in whose birth and growth the waters and the plants rejoiced; in whose birth and growth the waters and the plants grew; in whose birth and growth all the creatures of the good creation cried out, Hail [^1173]!

19\. 'In whose birth and growth Angra Mainyu rushed away from this wide, round earth, whose ends lie afar, and he, the evil-doing Angra Mainyu, who is all death, said: "All the gods together <span id="p275"><sup><small>[ p. 275 ]</small></sup></span> have not been able to smite me down in spite of myself, and Zarathu<i>s</i>tra alone can reach me in spite of myself.

20\. ‘ “He smites me with the Ahuna Vairya, as strong a weapon as a stone big as a house [^1174]; he burns me with Asha-Vahi<i>s</i>ta, as if it were melting brass [^1175]. He makes it better for me that I should leave this earth, he, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, the only one who can daunt me.” ’

21\. And the great Ashi Vanguhi exclaimed: ‘Come nearer unto me, thou pure, holy Spitama! lean against my chariot!’

Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra came nearer unto her, he leant against her chariot.

22\. And she caressed him with the left arm and the right, with the right arm and the left, thus speaking: ‘Thou art beautiful, O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! thou art well-shapen, O Spitama! strong are thy legs and long are thy arms: Glory is given to thy body and long cheerfulness [^1176] to thy soul, as sure as I proclaim it unto thee.’

## III.

24 [^1178]. To her did Haoshyangha, the Paradhâta, offer up a sacrifice, upon the enclosure of the Hara, the beautiful height, made by Mazda,

25\. He begged of her a boon, saying: ‘Grant <span id="p276"><sup><small>[ p. 276 ]</small></sup></span> me this, O great Ashi Vanguhi! that I may overcome all the Daêvas of Mâzana; that I may never fear and bow through terror before the Daêvas, but that all the Daêvas may fear and bow in spite of themselves before me, that they may fear and flee down to darkness.’

‘When the Turanians and the swift-horsed Naotaras [^1187], clapping their hands, ran after me, <span id="p281"><sup><small>[ p. 281 ]</small></sup></span> 55\. 'I hid myself under the foot of a bull walking under his burden; then young boys, and girls who had known no man, discovered me, even while the Turanians and the swift-horsed Naotaras, clapping their hands, were running after me.

56\. ‘Even I hid myself under the throat of a ram of hundredfold energy: then again young boys, and girls who had known no man, discovered me, even while the Turanians and the swift-horsed Naotaras, clapping their hands, were running after me.’

57\. The first wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi is her wailing about the courtezan who destroys her fruit: ‘Stand thou not near her, sit thou not on her bed!’—‘What shall I do? Shall I go back to the heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?’

58\. The second wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi is her wailing about the courtezan who brings forth a child conceived of a stranger and presents it to her husband: ‘What shall I do? Shall I go back to the heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?’

59\. This is the third wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi: ‘This is the worst deed that men and tyrants do, namely, when they deprive maids, that have been barren for a long time, of marrying and bringing forth children. What shall I do? Shall I go back to the heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?’

60\. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘O fair and wise Ashi, go not back to the heavens, sink not into the <span id="p282"><sup><small>[ p. 282 ]</small></sup></span> earth! Stay here and walk inside the fine kingly palace.’

61\. I shall worship thee with such a sacrifice, I shall worship and forward thee with such a sacrifice as Vî<i>s</i>tâspa offered unto thee, behind the river Dâitya [^1188]. The Zoatar lifted up a loud voice, with baresma before him. With that sort of sacrifice shall I worship thee? With that sort of sacrifice shall I worship and forward thee, O fair and wise Ashi?

For her brightness and glory, I will offer her a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

62\. Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of Ashi Vanguhi; of the good <i>K</i>isti; of the good Ereth<i>e</i>; of the good Rasãstâ<i>t</i>; of the Glory and Weal, made by Mazda [^1189].

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good .

\[Give\] unto that man brightness and glory, give him health of body, . . . . give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.
