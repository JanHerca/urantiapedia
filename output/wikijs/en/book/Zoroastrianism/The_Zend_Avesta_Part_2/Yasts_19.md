This Ya_s_t, inscribed to the Genius of the Earth, is devoted to a description of the mountains and the kingly Glory (kavaêm _H__v_arenô), which are invoked, together with the Earth, in the corresponding formula of the Sîrôzah (§ 28): there is no Ya_s_t devoted to the Earth itself.

The mountains are simply enumerated (§§ 1-8). The rest of the Ya_s_t is devoted to the praise of the _H__v_arenô, or, more precisely, to that of those who possessed it, whose powers or feats are described. The list begins with Ahura Mazda (§ 10), and closes with Saoshya_n__t_ (§ 89); that is to say, it begins with the beginning of the world, and closes with its end. It includes the Amesha-Spe_n_tas (§ 15), Haoshyangha (§ 26), Takhma Urupa (§ 28), Yima (§ 31), Mithra (§ 35), Thraêtaona (§ 36), Keresâspa (§ 38), the kings of the Kaianyan dynasty (§§ 66-72), Kavi Husravah (§ 74), Zarathu_s_tra (§ 79), Vî_s_tâspa (§ 84). The unsuccessful efforts of Franghrasyan to take possession of it are described at length (§§ 56-64).

This Ya_s_t would serve as a short history of the Iranian monarchy, an abridged Shah Nâmah.

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu_s_tra, one who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\], the holy and master of holiness . . . .

Unto Mount Ushi-darena, made by Mazda, the seat of holy happiness; unto the kingly Glory, made by Mazda; unto that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, made by Mazda [^1205],

<span id="p287">[<sup><small>p. 287</small></sup>]</span>

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

## I.

1\. The first mountain that rose up out of the earth, O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra! was the Haraiti Barez [^1206]. That mountain stretches all along the shores of the land washed by waters [^1207] towards the east.

The second mountain was Mount Zeredhô, outside [^1208] Mount Manusha [^1209]: this mountain too stretches all along the shores of the land washed by waters towards the east.

2\. From there grew up Mount Ushi-dh_a_u Ushi-darena [^1210], Mount Erezifya [^1211], and Mount Fraorepa.

The sixth was Mount Erezura [^1212].

The seventh was Mount Bumya [^1213].

The eighth was Mount Raoidhita [^1214].

<span id="p288">[<sup><small>p. 288</small></sup>]</span>

The ninth was Mount Mazi_s_i_s_v_a_u.

The tenth was Mount A_n_tare-danghu.

The eleventh was Mount Erezisha.

The twelfth was Mount Vâiti-gaêsa [^1215].

3\. And Mount Âdarana, Mount Bayana, Mount I_s_kata Upairi-saêna [^1216], with the . . . . [^1217] snows; the two Hama_n_kuna mountains, the eight Vasna mountains, the eight powerful Frâva_n_ku, the four Vidhvana summits;

4\. Mount Aêzakha, Mount Maênakha, Mount Vâkhedrakaê, Mount Asaya, Mount Tudhaskaê, Mount I_s_avaê, Mount Draoshi_s_v_a_u, Mount Sâiriv_a_u, Mount Nanghu_s_m_a_u, Mount Kakahyu, Mount A_n_tare-Kangha [^1218];

5\. Mount Si_k_idava [^1219], Mount Ahuna, Mount Raêmana, Mount Asha-stembana, Mount Urunyô-vâidhkaê, Mount Âsnava_n__t_ [^1220], Mount Ushaoma, Mount U_s_ta-_h__v_arenah, Mount Syâmaka [^1221], Mount Vafray_a_u, Mount Vourusha; <span id="p289">[<sup><small>p. 289</small></sup>]</span> 6\. Amongst which stand Mount _G_atara, Mount Adhutavau, Mount Spitavarena, Mount Spe_n_tô-dâta [^1222], Mount Kadrva-aspa [^1223], Mount Kaoirisa [^1224], Mount Taêra [^1225], Mount Barô-srayana, Mount Barana, Mount Frâpay_a_u, Mount Udrya, and Mount Raêva_n__t_ [^1226], and all those heights to which men have given the name of mount,

7\. To the number of two thousand mountains, and two hundred and forty and four [^1227], O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra!

8\. For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice worth being heard, namely, unto the awful kingly Glory. Unto the awful kingly Glory we offer up the libations, the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the tongue, the holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations, and the rightly-spoken words [^1228].

Yê_n_hê hâtãm: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda [^1228] . . . .

## II.

9\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda; most conquering, highly working, that possesses health, wisdom, and happiness, and is more powerful to destroy than all other creatures; <span id="p290">[<sup><small>p. 290</small></sup>]</span> 10\. That belongs to Ahura Mazda, as (through it) Ahura Mazda made the creatures, many and good, many and fair, many and wonderful, many and prosperous, many and bright;

11 [^1229]. So that they may restore the world, which will (thenceforth) never grow old and never die, never decaying and never rotting, ever living and ever increasing, and master of its wish, when the dead will rise, when life and immortality will come, and the world will be restored at its wish;

12\. When the creation will grow deathless,—the prosperous creation of the Good Spirit,—and the Dru_g_ shall perish, though she may rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord [^1230].

13\. For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## III.

14\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . . [^1231]

15 [^1232]. That belongs to the Amesha-Spe_n_tas, the bright ones, whose looks perform their wish, tall, quickly coming to do, strong, lordly, who are undecaying and holy;

16\. Who are all seven of one thought, who are all seven of one speech, who are all seven of one deed; whose thought is the same, whose speech is the same, whose deed is the same, whose father and commander is the same, namely, the Maker, Ahura Mazda. <span id="p291">[<sup><small>p. 291</small></sup>]</span> 17\. Who see one another's soul thinking of good thoughts, thinking of good words, thinking of good deeds, thinking of Garô-nmâna, and whose ways are shining as they go down to the libations;

18\. Who are the makers and governors, the shapers and overseers, the keepers and preservers of these creations of Ahura Mazda.

19 [^1233]. It is they who shall restore the world, which will (thenceforth) never grow old and never die, never decaying and never rotting, ever living and ever increasing, and master of its wish, when the dead will rise, when life and immortality will come, and the world will be restored at its wish;

20\. When the creation will grow deathless,—the prosperous creation of the Good Spirit,—and the Dru_g_ shall perish, though she may rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord.

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## IV.

21\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

22\. That belongs to the gods in the heavens and to those in the material world, and to the blessed ones, born or not yet born, who are to perform the restoration of the world [^1234].

23 [^1235]. It is they who shall restore the world, which will (thenceforth) never grow old and never die, never decaying and never rotting, ever living and <span id="p292">[<sup><small>p. 292</small></sup>]</span> ever increasing, and master of its wish, when the dead will rise, when life and immortality will come, and the world will be restored at its wish;

24\. When the creation will grow deathless,—the prosperous creation of the Good Spirit,—and the Dru_g_ shall perish, though she may rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord.

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## V.

25\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

26\. That clave unto Haoshyangha, the Paradhâta, for a long time [^1236], when he ruled over the seven Karshvares of the earth, over the Daêvas and men, over the Yâtus and the Pairikas, over the oppressors, the blind, and the deaf, he who smote two-thirds of the Daêvas of Mâzana and of the Varenya fiends [^1237].

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## VI.

27\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

28\. That clave unto Takhma Urupa, the well-armed, while he ruled over the seven Karshvares of the earth, over the Daêvas and men, the Yâtus and Pairikas, the oppressors, the blind, and the deaf;

29\. When he conquered all Daêvas and men, all the Yâtus and Pairikas, and rode Angra Mainyu, <span id="p293">[<sup><small>p. 293</small></sup>]</span> turned into the shape of a horse, all around the earth from one end to the other, for thirty years [^1238].

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## VII.

30\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

31\. That clave unto the bright Yima, the good shepherd, for a long time [^1239], while he ruled over the seven Karshvares of the earth, over the Daêvas and men, the Yâtus and Pairikas, the oppressors, the blind, and the deaf;

32\. He who took from the Daêvas both riches and welfare, both fatness and flocks, both weal and Glory [^1240];

In whose reign both aliments [^1241] were never failing for feeding creatures, flocks and men were undying, waters and plants were undrying;

33\. In whose reign there was neither cold wind nor hot wind, neither old age nor death, nor envy made by the Daêvas [^1242], in the times before his lie, before he began to have delight in words of falsehood and untruth.

34\. But when he began to find delight in words of falsehood and untruth [^1243], the Glory was seen to flee away from him in the shape of a bird. When his Glory had disappeared, then the great [^1244] Yima <span id="p294">[<sup><small>p. 294</small></sup>]</span> Khshaêta the good shepherd, trembled and was in sorrow before his foes [^1245]; he was confounded, and laid him down on the ground.

35\. The first time [^1246] when the Glory departed from the bright Yima, the Glory went from Yima, the son of Vîvangha_n__t_, in the shape of a Vâraghna bird [^1247].

Then Mithra seized that Glory, Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, whose ear is quick to hear, who has a thousand senses. We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of all countries, whom Ahura Mazda has created the most glorious of all the gods in the heavens.

36\. The second time when the Glory departed from the bright Yima, the Glory went from Yima, the son of Vîvangha_n__t_, in the shape of a Vâraghna bird.

Then Thraêtaona seized that Glory, he, the heir of the valiant Âthwya clan, who was the most victorious of all victorious men next to Zarathu_s_tra;

37\. Who smote A_z_i Dahâka, the three-mouthed, the three-headed, the six-eyed, who had a thousand senses, that most powerful, fiendish Dru_g_; that demon baleful to the world, the strongest Dru_g_ that Angra Mainyu created against the material world, to destroy the world of the good principle [^1248]. <span id="p295">[<sup><small>p. 295</small></sup>]</span> 38\. The third time when the Glory departed from the bright Yima, that Glory went from Yima, the son of Vîvangha_n__t_, in the shape of a Vâraghna bird. Then the manly-hearted Keresâspa [^1249] seized that Glory; he who was the sturdiest of the men of strength, next to Zarathu_s_tra, for his manly courage.

39\. For Manly Courage clave unto him. We worship Manly Courage, firm or foot, unsleeping, quick to rise, and fully awake, that clave unto Keresâspa;

40\. Who killed the snake Srvara, the horse-devouring, men-devouring, yellow, poisonous snake, over which yellow poison flowed a thumb's breadth thick. Upon him Keresâspa was cooking his food in a brass vessel: at the time of noon, the fiend felt the heat, and stood upon his feet: he rushed from under the brass vessel and upset the boiling water: the manly-hearted Keresâspa fell back affrighted [^1250];

41\. Who killed the golden-heeled Ga_n_darewa, that was rushing with open jaws, eager to destroy the living world of the good principle [^1251];

Who killed the brood of Pathana, all the nine [^1252]; <span id="p296">[<sup><small>p. 296</small></sup>]</span> and the brood of Nivika, and the brood of Dâ_s_tayana;

Who killed the golden-crowned Hitâspa [^1253], and Vareshava, the son of Dâna [^1254], and Pitaona, attended by many Pairikas [^1255];

42\. Who killed Arezô-shamana, him of the manly courage, who was strong, well-beloved [^1256], hail, energetically rushing, fully awake, never falling back. . . . [^1257];

43\. Who killed Snâvidhaka, him who killed with his nails, the stone-handed: thus did he exclaim to all around: 'I am an infant still, I am not yet of age: if I ever grow of age, I shall make the earth a wheel, I shall make the heavens a chariot;

44\. ‘I shall bring down the Good Spirit from the shining Garô-nmâna; I shall make the Evil Spirit rush up from the dreary Hell. They will carry my <span id="p297">[<sup><small>p. 297</small></sup>]</span> chariot, both the Good Spirit and the Evil One, unless the manly-hearted Keresâspa kill me.’

The manly-hearted Keresâspa killed him, his life went away, his spirit vanished [^1258].

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## VIII.

45\. We sacrifice unto the awful Glory, that cannot be forcibly seized [^1259], made by Mazda . . . .

46\. For which the Good Spirit and the Evil One did struggle with one another [^1260]: for that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized [^1259] they flung each of them. their darts most swift.

The Good Spirit flung a dart, and so did Vohu-Manô, and Asha-Vahi_s_ta and Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda.

The Evil Spirit flung a dart, and so did Akem-Manô [^1261], and Aêshma of the wounding spear, and A_z_i Dahâka and Spityura, he who sawed Yima in twain [^1262]. <span id="p298">[<sup><small>p. 298</small></sup>]</span> 47\. Then forward came Âtar [^1263], the son of Ahura Mazda, thinking thus in his heart: ‘I want to seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized.’

But A_z_i Dahâka, the three-mouthed, he of the evil law, rushed on his back, thinking of extinguishing it:

48\. ‘Here give it up to me [^1264], O Âtar, son of Ahura Mazda: if thou seizest that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, I shall rush upon thee, so that thou mayest never more blaze on the earth made by Ahura and protect the world of the good principle.’

And Âtar took back his hands, as the instinct of life prevailed, so much had A_z_i affrighted him.

49\. Then A_z_i, the three-mouthed, he of the evil law, rushed forward, thinking thus in his heart: ‘I want to seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized.’

But Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda, advanced behind him, speaking in these words:

50\. ‘There give it up to me [^1264], thou three-mouthed A_z_i Dahâka. If thou seizest that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, then I will enter thy hinder part, I will blaze up in thy jaws, so that thou mayest never more rush upon the earth made by Mazda and destroy the world of the good principle.’

Then A_z_i took back his hands, as the instinct of life prevailed, so much had Âtar affrighted him.

51\. That Glory swells up and goes to the sea <span id="p299">[<sup><small>p. 299</small></sup>]</span> Vouru-Kasha. The swift-horsed Son of the Waters [^1265] seizes it at once: this is the wish of the Son of the Waters, the swift-horsed: ‘I want to seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, down to the bottom of the sea Vouru-Kasha, in the bottom of the deep rivers.’

52\. We sacrifice unto the Son of the Waters, the swift-horsed, the tall and shining lord, the lord of females; the male god, who helps one at his appeal; who made man, who shaped man [^1266], a god who lives beneath waters, and whose ear is the quickest to hear when he is worshipped.

53\. ‘And whosoever of you, O men,’—thus said Ahura Mazda,—'O holy Zarathu_s_tra! shall seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, he has the gifts [^1267] of an Âthravan [^1268]; whosoever shall long for the illumination of knowledge, he has the gifts of an Âthravan; whosoever shall long for fulness of knowledge, he has the gifts of an Âthravan;

54\. ‘And Riches will cleave unto him, giving him full welfare, holding a shield before him, powerful, rich of cattle and garments; and Victory will cleave unto him, day after day; and likewise Strength, that smites more than a year. Attended by that Victory, he will conquer the havocking hordes; attended by that Victory, he will conquer all those who hate him.’

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

<span id="p300">[<sup><small>p. 300</small></sup>]</span>

## IX.

55\. We sacrifice unto the awful Glory, that cannot be forcibly seized, made by Mazda . . . .

56\. Which the Turanian ruffian Frangrasyan tried to seize in the sea Vouru-Kasha. He stripped himself naked, wishing to seize that Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathu_s_tra [^1269]. But the Glory escaped, the Glory fled away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm of the sea Vouru-Kasha was produced, namely, that lake that is called Lake Husravah [^1270].

57 [^1271]. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra! thinking evil thoughts: '. . . . [^1272] I have not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathu_s_tra.

58\. ‘Then I will defile all corn and liquors [^1273], as to greatness, goodness, and fairness.’

—‘Ahura Mazda will come against thee, ever eager to create new creatures [^1274].’

Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed down into the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra! <span id="p301">[<sup><small>p. 301</small></sup>]</span> 59\. A second time he stripped himself naked, wishing to seize that Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathu_s_tra. But the Glory escaped, the Glory fled away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm of the sea Vouru-Kasha was produced, namely, that lake that is called Lake Vanghazd_a_u [^1275].

60 [^1276]. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra! thinking evil thoughts: '. . . . [^1277] I have not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathu_s_tra.

61\. ‘Then I will defile all corn and liquors, as to greatness, goodness, and fairness.’

—‘Ahura Mazda will come against thee, ever eager to create new creatures.’

Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed down into the sea Vouru-Kasha.

62\. A third time he stripped himself naked, wishing to seize the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathu_s_tra. But the Glory escaped, the Glory fled away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm was produced in the sea Vouru-Kasha, namely, the water that is called Aw_z_\-dânva.

63 [^1278]. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra! thinking evil thoughts: ‘. . . . [^1279] I have <span id="p302">[<sup><small>p. 302</small></sup>]</span> not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathu_s_tra!’

64\. He was not able to seize the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathu_s_tra.

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## X.

65\. We sacrifice unto the awful Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, made by Mazda . . . .

66\. That cleaves unto him [^1280] who grows up there, where lies Lake Kãsava [^1281], along with the Haêtuma_n__t_ [^1282] river; there where stands Mount Ushidh_a_u [^1283], surrounded by waters, that run from the mountain.

67\. It [^1284] runs unto him, it flows and swells unto him, bringing good pastures and fine horses, bringing plenty, full of glory; with beauty and weal; powerful and friendly, rich of pastures, prolific and golden. It runs unto him, it flows and swells unto him, bright and glorious, making the white . . . . [^1285] grow, smiting away all plagues.

68\. And there comes with him a horse's strength, there comes with him a camel's strength, there <span id="p303">[<sup><small>p. 303</small></sup>]</span> comes with him a man's strength, there comes with him the kingly Glory: and there is in him, O holy Zarathu_s_tra! so much of kingly Glory as might extinguish at once all the non-Aryan nations.

69\. And then (through it) living creatures may keep away [^1286] hunger and death, living creatures (may keep away) cold and heat [^1286]. Such is the kingly Glory, the keeper of the Aryan nations and of the five kinds of animals [^1287], made to help the faithful and the Law of the worshippers of Mazda.

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## XI.

70\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

71\. That clave unto Kavi Kavâta, and unto Kavi Aipivôhu, and unto Kavi Usadha, and unto Kavi Arshan, and unto Kavi Pisina, and unto Kavi Byârshan, and unto Kavi Syâvarshan [^1288];

72\. So that they were all of them brave, all of them strong, all of them healthful, all of them wise, all of them happy in their wishes, all of them powerful kings.

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## XII.

73\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

74 [^1289]. That clave unto Kavi Husravah for the well-shapen Strength, for the Victory made by Ahura, for the crushing Ascendant; for the righteousness of the law, for the innocence of the law, for the <span id="p304">[<sup><small>p. 304</small></sup>]</span> unconquerable power of the law; for the extermination of the enemies at one stroke;

75\. And for the vigour of health, for the Glory made by Mazda, for the health of the body, and for a good, virtuous offspring, wise, chief in assemblies, bright, and clear-eyed, that frees \[their father\] from the pangs \[of hell\], of good intellect; and for that part in the blessed world that falls to wisdom and to those who do not follow impiety;

76\. And for a dominion full of splendour, for a long, long life, and for all boons and remedies;

77\. So that king Husravah \[had the lead\] all along the long race, and he could not pass through the forest, he [^1290], the murderer, who was fiercely striving against him on horseback; the lord Kavi Husravah prevailed over all; he put in bonds Frangrasyan and Keresavazda [^1291], to avenge the murder of his father Syâvarshâna, a man, and of Aghraêratha, a semi-man [^1292].

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## XIII.

78\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

79\. That clave unto the holy Zarathu_s_tra, so that he thought according to the Law, spake according <span id="p305">[<sup><small>p. 305</small></sup>]</span> to the Law, and did according to the Law; so that he was the holiest in holiness in all the living world, the best-ruling in exercising rule, the brightest in brightness, the most glorious in glory, the most victorious in victory.

80\. At his sight the Daêvas rushed away; at his sight the (demoniac) malices were extinguished; at his sight the _G_ainis [^1293] drew back their ways from the mortals and, lamenting [^1294] and wailing, laid violent hands on the Daêvas.

81\. And that one prayer, the Ahuna Vairya, which the holy Zarathu_s_tra sang and repeated four times, with a song that waxed louder and louder, drove back all the Daêvas beneath the earth, and took off from them sacrifice and prayer [^1295].

82\. It was it, the Glory of Zarathu_s_tra, that the Turanian ruffian Frangrasyan tried to seize to rule over all the Karshvares; round about the seven Karshvares did that ruffian Frangrasyan rush, trying to seize the Glory of Zarathu_s_tra [^1296]. But that Glory escaped to hidden inlets of the sea [^1297]; and there those two [^1298] made my will [^1299] roll on [^1300]; they entered my will, as it was my wish, Ahura Mazda's, and as it was the wish of the Law of Mazda.

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

<span id="p306">[<sup><small>p. 306</small></sup>]</span>

## XIV.

83\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

84\. That clave unto king Vî_s_tâspa, so that he thought according to the Law, spake according to the Law, and did according to the Law; so that he professed that Law, destroying his foes and causing the Daêvas to retire.

85 [^1301]. Who, driving the Dru_g_ before him [^1302], sought wide room for the holy religion; who, driving the Dru_g_ before him, made wide room for the holy religion; who made himself the arm and support of this law of Ahura, of this law of Zarathu_s_tra;

86\. Who took her, standing bound, from the hands of the Hunus, and established her to sit in the middle \[of the world\], high ruling, never falling back, holy, nourished with plenty of cattle and pastures, blessed with plenty of cattle and pastures.

87\. The valiant king Vî_s_tâspa conquered all enemies, Tãthrava_n__t_ of the evil law, Peshana, the worshipper of the Daêvas, and the fiendish wicked Are_g_a_t_\-aspa and the other wicked _H__v_yaonas [^1303].

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## XV.

88\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

89 [^1304]. That will cleave unto the victorious Saoshya_n__t_ and his helpers [^1305], when he shall restore the <span id="p307">[<sup><small>p. 307</small></sup>]</span> world, which will (thenceforth) never grow old and never die, never decaying and never rotting, ever living and ever increasing, and master of its wish, when the dead will rise, when life and immortality will come, and the world will be restored at its wish;

90\. When the creation will grow deathless,—the prosperous creation of the Good Spirit,—and the Dru_g_ shall perish, though she may rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord.

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

## XVI.

91\. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . .

92\. When Astva_t_\-ereta [^1306] shall rise up from Lake Kãsava [^1307], a friend of Ahura Mazda, a son of Vîspa-taurvairi [^1308], knowing the victorious knowledge.

It was that Glory that Thraêtaona bore with him when A_z_i Dahâka was killed [^1309];

93\. That Frangrasyan, the Turanian, bore when Drv_a_u [^1310] was killed, when the Bull was killed [^1311];

That king Husravah bore when Frangrasyan, the Turanian, was killed [^1312];

<span id="p308">[<sup><small>p. 308</small></sup>]</span>

That king Vî_s_tâspa bore, when he victoriously maintained Holiness against the host of the fiends and took off the Drub from the world of the good principle [^1313].

94\. He [^1314], with the eye of intelligence [^1315], shall look down upon all the creatures of the Paê_s_i_s_ [^1316], her of the evil seed: he shall look upon the whole living world with the eye of plenty, and his look shall deliver to immortality the whole of the living creatures.

95\. And there shall his friends [^1317] come forward, the friends of Astva_t_\-ereta, who are fiend-smiting, well-thinking, well-speaking, well-doing, following the good law, and whose tongues have never uttered a word of falsehood.

Before them shall Aêshma of the wounding spear, who has no Glory, bow and flee; he shall smite the most wicked Dru_g_, her of the evil seed, born of darkness.

96\. Akem-Manô [^1318] smites, but Vohu-Manô shall smite him; the Word of falsehood smites, but the Word of truth shall smite it. Haurvatâ_t_ and Ameretâ_t_ [^1319] shall smite both hunger and thirst: Haurvatâ_t_ and Ameretâ_t_ shall smite the evil hunger and the evil thirst. The evil-doing Angra Mainyu bows and flees, becoming powerless.

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

97\. Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

<span id="p309">[<sup><small>p. 309</small></sup>]</span>

I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of Mount Ushi-darena, made by Mazda, the seat of holy happiness; of the kingly Glory, made by Mazda; of the Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, made by Mazda [^1320].

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

\[Give\] unto that man [^1321] brightness and glory, . . . . give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.

[^1287]: 289:4 Cf. Yt. XV, 7, and [p. 58](Yasts_5#p58), note [2](Yasts_5#fn295).

[^1288]: 289:5 See [p. 8](Sirozahs_1#p8), notes [1](Sirozahs_1#fn46) and [2](Sirozahs_1#fn47).

[^1289]: 289:6 ‘The other mountains have grown out of Albûr_z_, in number 2244 mountains’ (Bund. XII, 2).

[^1291]: 289:7 See notes to Yt. III, 17 ([p. 47](Yasts_3#p47)).

[^1292]: 290:1 §§ 11-12 = §§ 19-20, 23-24, 89-90.

[^1293]: 290:2 Doubtful.

[^1294]: 290:3 As above, § 9.

[^1295]: 290:4 §§ 15-17 = Yt. XIII, 82-84.

[^1296]: 291:1 §§ 19-20 = §§ 11-12.

[^1297]: 291:2 The Saoshya_n__t_s; see [p. 165](Yasts_11#p165), note [1](Yasts_11#fn769).

[^1298]: 291:3 §§ 23-24 = §§ 19-20.

[^1299]: 292:1 For forty years, according to the Bundahi_s_ (XXXIV, 4); for thirty years, according to Firdausi.

[^1300]: 292:2 See Yt. V, 22.

[^1301]: 293:1 Cf. Yt. XV, 12, and notes.

[^1302]: 293:2 For six hundred and sixteen years and six months (Bundahi_s_ XXXIV, 4).

[^1303]: 293:3 See Yt. V, 26, text and note.

[^1304]: 293:4 Food and drink.

[^1305]: 293:5 Cf. Yt. XV, 16.

[^1306]: 293:6 He pretended to be a god (Firdausi).

[^1307]: 293:7 Doubtful: fraê_s_ta.

[^1308]: 294:1 A_z_i Dahâka and his followers.

[^1309]: 294:2 The Glory is described as departing three times, because it is threefold, according as it belongs to the king considered as a priest, a warrior, or a husbandman. In that threefold character it is identical with Âdar Frobâ, Âdar Gushasp, and Âdar Bûrzîn Mihr ([p. 7](Sirozahs_1#p7), notes).

[^1310]: 294:3 A raven, one of the incarnations of the Genius of Victory (Yt. XIV, 18-21; cf. ibid. § 35).

[^1311]: 294:4 Cf. Yt. V, 34.

[^1312]: 295:1 See V, 37 (pp. [62](Yasts_5#p62)\-[63](Yasts_5#p63), and notes); XIII, 136; XV, 27.

[^1313]: 295:2 Cf. Yasna IX, II (34-39). This tale belongs to the widespread cyclus of the island-whale (a whale whose back is mistaken by sailors for an island; they land upon it, cook their food there, and the monster. awaked by the heat, flies off and carries them away: see Arabian Nights, Seventy-first Night; Babâ Bathrâ, 5).

[^1314]: 295:3 See Yt. V, 38.

[^1315]: 295:4 Known in the Minokhired (XXVII, 50) as ‘the wolf Kapô_d_’ (perhaps ‘the blue wolf,’ as Mr. West suggests), ‘which they also call P_e_han.’ Those nine sons of Pathana were nine highwaymen (the very word Pathana seems to have that meaning): their defeat is told by Keresâspa in a Pahlavi Rivâyat as follows: ‘I have slain the highwaymen who were so big in body that, when they were p. 296 walking, people considered in this way, that “below them are the stars and moon, and below them moves the sun at dawn, and the water of the sea reaches up to their knees.” And I reached up to their legs, and they were smitten on the legs by me; they fell, and the hills on the earth were shattered by them’ (West, Pahlavi Texts, II, 376). Keresâspa's Fravashi, accordingly, is invoked against thieves (Yt. XIII, 136). Perhaps the assimilation of the wolf Kapô_d_ with P_e_han is merely a guess of the author of the Minokhired.

[^1316]: 296:1 The murderer of Keresâspa's brother, Urvâkhshaya (Yt. XV, 28).

[^1317]: 296:2 Doubtful: dânayana. Vâresha is the Pahlavi name of a bird of prey (Bund. XIV, 30), which might induce us to identify Vareshava with the gigantic bird Kamak, ‘which overshadowed the earth and kept off the rain till the rivers dried up’ (West, l.l. 378), and whose destruction was one of the feats of Keresâspa.

[^1318]: 296:3 Like the Pairika Knãthaiti, who clave to Keresâspa (Vend. I, 10 \[36\]).

[^1319]: 296:4 Doubtful: frâzu_s_tem.

[^1320]: 296:5 The rest of the sentence is obscure, and the text seems to be corrupt.

[^1321]: 297:1 Snâvidhaka reminds one vividly of the Titanic Otus and Ephialtes (Odyssea XI, 308):
  ‘Such were they youths! Had they to manhood grown,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almighty Jove had trembled on his throne:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ere the harvest of the beard began
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bristle on the chin, and promise man,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shafts Apollo aim’d.' (Pope.)

[^1324]: 297:2 The sacerdotal Glory; see [p. 11](Sirozahs_1#p11), note [6](Sirozahs_1#fn78), cf. § 53.

[^1323]: 297:3 When it had departed from Yima.

[^1325]: 297:4 Bad Thought, the demoniac counterpart of Vohu-Manô (Vend. Introd. IV, 34).

[^1326]: 297:5 Spityura was a brother of Yima's (Bund. XXXI, 3: ‘Spîtûr was he who, with Dahâk, cut up Yim,’ ibid. 5, tr. West). Nothing more is known of him, though he appears to have played a great part in the original Yima legend, and to have stood to his brother in the same relation as Barmâyûn and Katâyûn to Ferîdûn, or p. 298 Shagâd to Rustam. Firdausi does not mention him, and makes Dahâk himself saw _G_emshîd.

[^1327]: 298:1 Âdar Frobâ (the Glory of the Priest) is meant here: ‘when they sawed Yim, Âdar Frobâ saved his Glory from the hand of Dahâk’ (Bund. XVII, 5; Études Iraniennes, II, 70, 84).

[^1329]: 298:2 Doubtful.

[^1330]: 299:1 Apãm Napâ_t_; see [p. 6](Sirozahs_1#p6), note [1](Sirozahs_1#fn28).

[^1331]: 299:2 An allusion to old myths on the igneous origin of life (Ormazd et Ahriman, § 78).

[^1332]: 299:3 Doubtful.

[^1333]: 299:4 As that Glory is the one that belongs to the Âthravan.

[^1334]: 300:1 See Études Iraniennes, II, 227; cf. § 82.

[^1335]: 300:2 Lake Husru is within fifty leagues (parasang) of Lake _K_ê_k_ast' (Lake Urumiah, Bund. XXII, 8, tr. West).

[^1336]: 300:3 Cf. §§ 60, 63.

[^1337]: 300:4 Itha itha yathana ahmâi.

[^1338]: 300:5 Tarshu_k_a khshudra_k_a, translated dhânyâni madhûni_k_a (Sansk. tr. to Âfrîgân Gâhambâr, § 12). Afrâsyâb was charged with having laid Iran waste by filling up or conducting away rivers (Hamzah Ispahensis, p. 34; cf. Bund. XXI, 6).

[^1339]: 300:6 This looks like an answer to Afrâsyâb's threats.

[^1340]: 301:1 The situation of that lake is not stated.

[^1341]: 301:2 Cf. § 57, 63.

[^1342]: 301:3 Itha itha yathana ahmâi avatha itha yathana ahmâi.

[^1343]: 301:4 Cf. §§ 57, 60.

[^1344]: 301:5 Itha itha yathana ahmâi avatha itha yathana ahmâi âvoya itha yathana ahmâi.

[^1345]: 302:1 That is to say, to any one who . . . . The Kavis or Kings of Iran are meant: Lake Kãsava was supposed to be ‘the home of the Kayân race’ (Bund. XXI, 7). The Kavis are enumerated in the following clauses (§§ 71 seq.).

[^1346]: 302:2 The present Zarah or Hamûn sea in Seistan.

[^1347]: 302:3 The Helmend (Ἐτύμανδρος; cf. Vend. I, 14).

[^1348]: 302:4 The seat of the _H__v_arenô; see [p. 33](Yasts_1#p33), note [1](Yasts_1#fn172), [p. 287](#p287), note [^1210], and Introduction to Yt. XVIII.

[^1349]: 302:5 The water of the rivers in which the Glory lies, and in the midst of which the Kavi has been nourished.

[^1350]: 302:6 ? Varemi_s_.

[^1352]: 303:1 Doubtful.

[^1353]: 303:2 See [p. 182](Yasts_13#p182), note [2](Yasts_13#fn817).

[^1354]: 303:3 See Yt. XIII, § 132.

[^1355]: 303:4 §§ 74-76 = Yt. XIII, 133-135.

[^1356]: 304:1 Aurvasâra; see Yt. XV, 32; cf. Yt. V, 50 (where the words all along the long race have been omitted in the translation). The words have the lead here have been supplied from Yt. V, 50: the text here has two words, tãm keresem, of which both the reading and the meaning are doubtful.

[^1357]: 304:2 Keresavazda, the Karsîvaz of Firdausi, the brother of Afrâsyâb and the murderer of Syâvarshâna: he was put to death by Husravah in company with his brother (Études Iraniennes, II, 227).

[^1358]: 304:3 See [p. 114](Yasts_9#p114), note [7](Yasts_9#fn545).

[^1359]: 305:1 See Vend. XX, 10.

[^1360]: 305:2 Doubtful. Perhaps: and lamenting and wailing the Daêvas left off injuring.

[^1361]: 305:3 Cf. Yt. XIII, 90.

[^1362]: 305:4 See above, §§ 56-64.

[^1363]: 305:5 Cf. §§ 56, 59, 62.

[^1364]: 305:6 Zarathu_s_tra and Vî_s_tâspa (?); cf. §§ 84-87.

[^1365]: 305:7 Meaning my law.

[^1366]: 305:8 Cf. Yt. XIII, 89, note 5.

[^1367]: 306:1 §§ 85-86 = Yt. XIII, 99-100.

[^1368]: 306:2 Or ‘with his spear pushed forwards;’ see [p. 205](Yasts_13#p205), note [1](Yasts_13#fn924).

[^1369]: 306:3 Cf. Yt. V, 109.

[^1370]: 306:4 §§ 89-90 = §§ 11-12.

[^1371]: 306:5 See [p. 117](Yasts_9#p117), note [6](Yasts_9#fn555).

[^1372]: 307:1 Saoshya_n__t_; cf. Yt. XIII, 129.

[^1373]: 307:2 Cf. §66 and Vend. XIX, 5 (18).

[^1374]: 307:3 See Yt. XIII, 142.

[^1375]: 307:4 Cf. § 36.

[^1376]: 307:5 Or ‘the demon.’

[^1377]: 307:6 This line is in contradiction with what we know of the Frangrasyan legend, unless the text is corrupt and the name of Frangrasyan has been introduced here by mistake (for Keresâspa?). Yet it may allude to brighter sides, unknown to us, of the Turanian hero: the Bull (g_a_u_s_) may be his brother Aghraêratha, the Bull-man (Gôpatishâh); see [p. 114](Yasts_9#p114), note [7](Yasts_9#fn545).

[^1378]: 307:7 See § 77.

[^1379]: 308:1 Cf. § 84.

[^1380]: 308:2 Saoshya_n__t_.

[^1386]: 309:1 Cf. § 0.

[^1387]: 309:2 Who sacrifices to the kingly Glory.
