## Footnotes

[^4]: 3:1 J. Halévy, Revue des Études Juives, 1881, October, p. 188.

[^5]: 3:2 See Yt. I, 1-23.

[^6]: 3:3 See Yt. II.

[^7]: 4:1 See Yt. I, 24-33.

[^8]: 4:2 Âkh<i>s</i>ti does not so much mean Peace as the power that secures peace; see note 4.

[^9]: 4:3 Hãm-vai<i>n</i>ti, from hãm-vâ (Yt. X, 141); possibly from van, to strike: ‘Peace that smites.’

[^10]: 4:4 Taradhâtem anyâi<i>s</i> dâmãn, interpreted: tarvînîtârtûm min zakî ân dâmân pun anâshtîh akár kartan (Phl. Comm.), ‘more destroying than other creatures, to make Non-peace (Anâkh<i>s</i>ti) powerless.’

[^12]: 4:5 Âsnya khratu, the inborn intellect, intuition, contrasted with gaoshô-srûta khratu, the knowledge acquired by hearing and learning. There is between the two nearly the same relation as between the parâvidyâ and aparâvidyâ in Brahmanism, the former reaching Brahma in se (parabrahma), the latter <i>s</i>abdabrahma, the word-Brahma (Brahma as taught and revealed). The Mobeds of later times interpreted their name Magû<i>s</i>, ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/00400.jpg), as meaning, ‘men without ears,’ ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/00401.jpg), ‘pour insinuer que leur Docteur avait puisé toute sa science dans le ciel et qu’il ne l’avait pas apprise par l’ouïe comme les autres hommes’ (Chardin, III, 130; ed. Amsterdam).

[^13]: 4:6 See Yt. III.

[^14]: 4:7 See Vend. XXII.

[^15]: 4:8 The ‘golden instrument’ mentioned in Nyâyi<i>s</i> I, 8.

[^16]: 4:9 A personification of the Ormazdean weal; cf. Vend. XXII, 3 \[8\], and Yt. XIII, 42.

[^17]: 4:10 Vouru-dôithra, kâmak dôisr; she is ‘the genius of the good p. 5 eye, mînôî hu<i>k</i>a<i>s</i>mîh’ (Vend. XIX, 36 \[523\]), the reverse of the evil eye (Yasna LXVII, 62 \[LXVIII, 22\]; cf. Études Iraniennes, II, 182).

[^18]: 5:1 Vend. Introd. IV, 33; Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 202-206.

[^19]: 5:2 Ibid.

[^20]: 5:3 Vend. Introd. IV, 30.

[^21]: 5:4 See Yt. IV.

[^22]: 5:5 See Vend. Introd. IV, 34.

[^23]: 5:6 The white Hôm, or plant of immortality; see Vend. Introd. IV, 28.

[^24]: 5:7 See Gâhs.

[^25]: 5:8 See Yt. X.

[^26]: 5:9 See Yt. XV. Cf. Yasna I, 3 (7-9), where Mithra and Râma are invoked in company with the genius of the Hâvani period of the day.

[^27]: 5:10 The Genius of Fire.

[^28]: 5:11 Cf. Yasna I, 4 (10-12), where Asha-Vahi<i>s</i>ta and Âtar are invoked in company with the genius of the Rapithwin period of the day.

[^29]: 6:1 Literally ‘the Son of the Waters;’ he was originally the Fire of lightning, as born in the clouds (like the Vedic Apâm napât); he still appears in that character, Yt. VIII, 34; he is for that reason ‘the lord of the females’ because the waters were considered as females (cf. Yasna XXXVIII, 1 \[2\]). But, as napâ<i>t</i> means also ‘navel’ (the same words having often the two meanings of navel' and offspring;' cf. nâbhi in the Vedas and the Zend nâfyô, ‘offspring,’ from nâfa ‘navel’), Apãm Napâ<i>t</i> was interpreted as ‘the spring of the waters, the navel of the waters,’ which was supposed to be at the source of the Arvand (the Tigris; Neriosengh ad Yasna I, 5 \[15\]); cf. Yt. V, 72.

[^30]: 6:2 Cf. Yasna I, 5 \[13-15\].

[^31]: 6:3 See Yt. XIII.

[^32]: 6:4 Perhaps better: ‘to the flocks of Fravashis of the faithful, men and women.’

[^33]: 6:5 The Genius of Victory; see Yt. XIV.

[^34]: 6:6 Cf. Yasna I, 6 \[16-19\].

[^35]: 6:7 See Yt. XI and Vend. Introd. IV, 31; Farg. XVIII, 14 seq.

[^36]: 6:8 The Genius of Truth; see Yt. XII.

[^37]: 6:9 Truth; see Yt. XVIII.

[^38]: 6:10 Cf. Yasna I, 7 \[20-23\].

[^39]: 6:11 The day before Âdar (Dai is the Persian ( ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/00600.jpg), ‘yesterday,’ which is the same word as the Sanskrit hyas, Latin heri). The eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-third days of the month are under the p. 7 rule of Ahura and the Amesha-Spe<i>n</i>tas, like the first day; they have therefore no name of their own and are named from the day that follows. The month was divided into four weeks, the first two numbering seven days, the last two numbering eight.

[^40]: 7:1 Or better the Glories of the Aryas' (Eramde<i>s</i>a<i>s</i>rî<i>n</i>âm): the Glory or <i>H</i><i>v</i>arenô (Vend. Introd. IV, II, p. lxiii, note 1) is threefold, according as it illuminates the priest, the warrior, or the husbandman. Ya<i>s</i>t XIX is devoted to the praise of the <i>H</i><i>v</i>arenô.

[^41]: 7:2 Or ‘the awful kingly glory:’ Kavi means a king, but it is particularly used of the kings belonging to the second and most celebrated of the two mythical dynasties of Iran. The Kavis succeeded the Paradhâta or Pêshdâdians, and Darius Codomanes was supposed to be the last of them. For an enumeration of the principal Kavis, see Yt. XIII, 132 seq. The <i>H</i><i>v</i>arenô alluded to in this clause is the <i>H</i><i>v</i>arenô of the priest; ‘it is the fire known as Âdaraprâ \[Âdar Frobâ\]; or better Âdar Farnbag: see Études Iraniennes, II, 84; its object is the science of the priests; by its help priests become learned and clever’ (Sanskrit transl. to the Âtash Nyâyish).

[^42]: 7:3 See Yt. V, 41, note.

[^43]: 7:4 See Yt. XIX, 56.

[^44]: 7:5 A mountain in Adarbai<i>g</i>ân (Bundahi<i>s</i> XII, 26), where king Husravah settled the fire Gushasp.

[^45]: 7:6 See Yt. V, 49.

[^46]: 7:7 The glory of the warriors, the fire known as Âdar Gushasp or Gushnasp; with its help king Husravah destroyed the idol-temples near Lake <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast, and he settled it on Mount Âsnava<i>n</i><i>t</i> (Bund. XVII, 7).

[^47]: 8:1 A mountain in Khorâsân on which the Burzîn fire is settled (Bund. XII, 18).

[^48]: 8:2 ‘The fire known as Âdarabura<i>g</i>âmihira \[Âdar Burzîn Mihir\]; its object is the science of husbandry.’ King Gu<i>s</i>tâsp established it on Mount Raêva<i>n</i><i>t</i> (Bund. XVII, 8).

[^49]: 8:3 All sorts of fires. See another classification, Yasna XVII, II \[63-67\] and Bundahi<i>s</i> XVII, 1.

[^50]: 8:4 See Vend. XXII, 7.

[^51]: 8:5 The fire Nairyô-sangha, as the messenger of Ahura, burns hereditarily in the bosom of his earthly representative, the king.

[^52]: 8:6 See Yt. V.

[^53]: 8:7 See Yt. VI.
