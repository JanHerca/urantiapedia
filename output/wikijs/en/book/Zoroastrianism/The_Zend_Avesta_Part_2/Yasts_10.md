This Ya_s_t, one of the longest of the Avesta and one of the most interesting in a literary point of view, is not very instructive for mythology. It consists of long descriptive pieces, sometimes rather spirited, and of fervent prayers and invocations for mercy or protection. Originally Mithra was the god of the heavenly light (§§ 12, 50, 67, 104, 124 seq., 136 seq., &c.); and in that character he knows the truth, as he sees everything; he is therefore taken as a witness of truth, he is the preserver of oaths and good faith (§§ 2, 44 seq., 79 seq., 81 seq., &c.); he chastises those who break their promises and lie to Mithra, destroys their houses and smites them in battle (§§ 17 seq., 28 seq., 35 seq., 47 seq., 99 seq., 105 seq., 112 seq., 128 seq., &c.).

Particularly interesting are §§ 115-118, as giving a sketch of moral hierarchy in Iran, and §§ 121-122, as being perhaps the source of the trials in the later Roman Mithraicism. Cf. Vend. Introd. IV, 8 and Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 59-61.

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu_s_tra, one who hates the Daêvas, and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\], the holy and master of holiness . . . .

Unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, who has a thousand ears, ten thousand eyes, a Yazata invoked by his own name, and unto Rama _H__v_âstra [^556],

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

## I.

1\. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu_s_tra, saying: 'Verily, when I created Mithra, the lord of <span id="p120">[<sup><small>p. 120</small></sup>]</span> wide pastures, O Spitama! I created him as worthy of sacrifice, as worthy of prayer as myself, Ahura Mazda [^557].

2\. 'The ruffian who lies unto Mithra [^558] brings death unto the whole country, injuring as much the faithful world as a hundred evil-doers [^559] could do. Break not the contract, O Spitama! neither the one that thou hadst entered into with one of the unfaithful, nor the one that thou hadst entered into with one of the faithful who is one of thy own faith [^560]. For Mithra stands for both the faithful and the unfaithful.

3\. 'Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, gives swiftness to the horses of those who lie not unto Mithra.

‘Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, gives the straightest way to those who lie not unto Mithra.

‘The good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful give a virtuous offspring to those who lie not unto Mithra.

4\. 'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard, namely, unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures.

‘We offer up libations unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, who gives a happy dwelling and a good dwelling to the Aryan nations.

5\. 'May he come to us for help! May he come to us for ease! May he come to us for joy! May he come to us for mercy! May he come to us for health! May he come to us for victory! May he <span id="p121">[<sup><small>p. 121</small></sup>]</span> come to us for good conscience [^561]! May he come to us for bliss [^562]! he, the awful and overpowering, worthy of sacrifice and prayer, not to be deceived anywhere in the whole of the material world, Mithra, the lord of wide pastures.

6\. 'I will offer up libations unto him, the strong Yazata, the powerful Mithra, most beneficent to the creatures: I will apply unto him with charity [^563] and prayers: I will offer up a sacrifice worth being heard unto him, Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, with the Haoma and meat, with the baresma, with the wisdom of the tongue, with the holy spells, with the speech, with the deeds, with the libations, and with the rightly-spoken words.

‘Yê_n_hê hâtãm: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda [^564] . . . .

## II.

7\. 'We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, who is truth-speaking, a chief in assemblies, with a thousand ears, well-shapen, with ten thousand eyes, high, with full knowledge [^565], strong, sleepless, and ever awake [^566]; <span id="p122">[<sup><small>p. 122</small></sup>]</span> 8\. 'To whom the chiefs of nations offer up sacrifices, as they go to the field, against havocking hosts, against enemies coming in battle array, in the strife of conflicting nations.

9\. 'On whichever side he has been worshipped first in the fulness of faith of a devoted heart, to that side turns Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, with the fiend-smiting wind, with the cursing thought of the wise [^567].

‘For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

## III.

10\. 'We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, . . . . sleepless, and ever awake.

11\. 'Whom the horsemen worship on the back of their horses, begging swiftness for their teams, health for their own bodies, and that they may watch with full success those who hate them, smite down their foes, and destroy at one stroke their adversaries, their enemies, and those who hate them [^568].

‘For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

## IV.

12\. 'We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, . . . . sleepless, and ever awake;

13\. 'Who first of the heavenly gods reaches over the Hara [^569], before the undying, swift-horsed sun [^570]; <span id="p123">[<sup><small>p. 123</small></sup>]</span> who, foremost in a golden array, takes hold of the beautiful summits, and from thence looks over the abode of the Aryans with a beneficent eye.

14\. 'Where the valiant chiefs draw up their many troops in array [^571]; where the high mountains, rich in pastures and waters, yield plenty to the cattle [^572]; where the deep lakes, with salt waters, stand [^573]; where wide-flowing rivers swell and hurry towards I_s_kata and Pouruta, Mouru and Harôyu, the Gava-Sughdha and _H__v_âirizem [^574];

15\. 'On Arezahi and Savahi, on Fradadhafshu and Vîdadhafshu, on Vourubare_s_ti and Vourubare_s_ti, on this bright Karshvare of _H__v_aniratha [^575], the abode of cattle, the dwelling of cattle, the powerful Mithra looks with a health-bringing eye;

16\. 'He who moves along all the Karshvares, a Yazata unseen, and brings glory; he who moves along all the Karshvares, a Yazata unseen, and brings sovereignty; and increases [^576] strength for <span id="p124">[<sup><small>p. 124</small></sup>]</span> victory to those who, with a pious intent, holily offer him libations.

‘For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

17\. We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, . . . . sleepless, and ever awake;

‘Unto whom nobody must lie, neither the master of a house, nor the lord of a borough, nor the lord of a town, nor the lord of a province.

18\. 'If the master of a house lies unto him, or the lord of a borough, or the lord of a town, or the lord of a province, then comes Mithra, angry and offended, and he breaks asunder the house, the borough, the town, the province; and the masters of the houses, the lords of the boroughs, the lords of the towns, the lords of the provinces, and the foremost men of the provinces.

19\. 'On whatever side there is one who has lied unto Mithra, on that side Mithra stands forth, angry and offended, and his wrath [^577] is slow to relent [^578].

20\. 'Those who lie unto Mithra, however swift they may be running, cannot overtake [^579]; riding, cannot . . . . [^579]; driving, cannot [^579] The spear that the foe of Mithra flings, darts backwards, for the <span id="p125">[<sup><small>p. 125</small></sup>]</span> number of the evil spells that the foe of Mithra works out [^580].

21\. 'And even though the spear be flung well, even though it reach the body, it makes no wound, for the number of the evil spells that the foe of Mithra works out [^580]. The wind drives away the spear that the foe of Mithra flings, for the number of the evil spells that the foe of Mithra works out.

‘For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

## VI.

22\. 'We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, . . . . sleepless, and ever awake;

‘Who takes out of distress the man who has not lied unto him, who takes him out of death.

23\. 'Take us out of distress, take us out of distresses, O Mithra! as we have not lied unto thee. Thou bringest down terror upon the bodies of the men who lie unto Mithra; thou takest away the strength from their arms, being angry and all-powerful; thou takest the swiftness from their feet, the eye-sight from their eyes, the hearing from their ears.

24\. 'Not the wound [^581] of the well-sharpened spear or of the flying arrow reaches that man to whom Mithra comes for help with all the strength of his soul, he, of the ten thousand spies, the powerful, all-seeing, undeceivable Mithra.

‘For his brightness and glory, I will offer him a sacrifice worth being heard . . . .

25\. 'We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, . . . . sleepless, and ever awake;

‘Who is lordly, deep, strong, and weal-giving; a chief in assemblies, pleased with prayers [^582], high, holily clever, the incarnate Word, a warrior with strong arms;

26\. 'Who breaks the skulls of the Daêvas, and is most cruel in exacting pains; the punisher of the men who lie unto Mithra, the withstander of the Pairikas; who, when not deceived, establisheth nations in supreme strength; who, when not deceived, establisheth nations in supreme victory;

27\. 'Who confounds the ways of the nation that delights in havoc, who turns away their Glory [^583], takes away their strength for victory, blows them away helpless [^584], and delivers them unto ten thousand strokes; he, of the ten thousand spies, the powerful, all-seeing, undeceivable Mithra.

30\. 'Thou makest houses large, beautiful with women, beautiful with chariots, with well-laid foundations [^586], and high above their groundwork [^587]; thou makest that house lofty, beautiful with women, beautiful with chariots, with well-laid foundations, and high above its groundwork, of which the master, pious and holding libations in his hand, offers thee a sacrifice, in which thou art invoked by thy own name and with the proper words.

31\. 'With a sacrifice, in which thou art invoked by thy own name, with the proper words will I offer thee libations, O powerful Mithra!

34\. 'Grant that we, in a good spirit and high spirit, exalted in joy and a good spirit, may smite all our foes; that we, in a good spirit and high spirit, exalted in joy and a good spirit, may smite all our enemies; that we, in a good spirit and high spirit, exalted in joy and a good spirit, may smite all the malice of Daêvas and Men, of the Yâtus and Pairikas, of the oppressors, the blind, and the deaf [^594].

[^579]: 119:1 Sîrôzah I, 16.

[^580]: 120:1 Cf. Yt. VIII, 50.

[^581]: 120:2 The Mithradru_g_: one might also translate ‘who breaks the contract,’ as mithra, as a common noun, means ‘a contract.’

[^582]: 120:3 Kayadhas; cf. Yt. I, 19.

[^583]: 120:4 Cf. Ardâ Viraf, chap. lii.

[^584]: 121:1 Cheerfulness at the head of the _K_inva_t_ bridge (Yasna LXII, 6 \[LXI, 17\]; cf. Vend. XVIII, 6).

[^585]: 121:2 The condition of the blessed in the next world.

[^586]: 121:3 Va_n_ta, ‘assistance, that is, making _g_âdangôi’ (Yasna LXII \[LXI\], 1; _g_âdangôi is making a collection for the poor (Études Iraniennes, II, 155).

[^587]: 121:4 As [p. 30](Yasts_1#p30).

[^588]: 121:5 Perethu-vaêdhayana: sampûr_n_avittâram kâryanyâyânam (Khorshê_d_ Nyâyi_s_ 6).

[^589]: 121:6 _G_aghâurv_a__u_ng hem: this word, strangely enough, is generally translated ‘who has most strong arms’ (balish_th_abhu_g_am); _g_agâuru is translated in the same way.

[^590]: 122:1 See [p. 12](Sirozahs_1#p12), note [13](Sirozahs_1#fn94).

[^591]: 122:2 Cf. Yt. V, 53; X, 94.

[^592]: 122:3 Mount Albôrz, whence the sun rises; see § 50.

[^593]: 122:4 Mithra is closely connected with the sun, but not yet identical with it, as he became in later times ( ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/12200.jpg), the sun; Deo invicto Soli Mithrae).

[^594]: 123:1 In the flat countries.

[^595]: 123:2 In the mountainous parts of Iran.

[^596]: 123:3 In the lake regions (Seistan, Farsistan, Âdarbai_g_ân).

[^597]: 123:4 In the country of the large rivers in the East. Mouru is Marv (Margiana), with the Murghâb river (the Margus); Harôyu is the Herat country, with the Harêrûd; Gava-Sughdha and _H__v_ârizm are Sogdiana and Khvârizm, with the Oxus. The situation of I_s_kata and Pouruta is not clear: one might think of Alexander eschata on the Iaxartes and the Paretacene country between the Oxus and the Iaxartes.

[^598]: 123:5 The earth is divided into seven Karshvares, separated from one another by seas and mountains impassable to men. Arezahi and Savahi are the western and the eastern Karshvare; Fradadhafshu and Vîdadhafshu are in the south; Vourubare_s_ti and Vouru_g_are_s_ti are in the north; _H__v_aniratha is the central Karshvare. _H__v_aniratha is the only Karshvare inhabited by man (Bundahi_s_ XI, 3).

[^599]: 123:6 Doubtful.

[^600]: 124:1 Mainyu, in the meaning of the Sanskrit manyu (?).

[^601]: 124:2 Doubtful; aspa_k_a_t_: cf. ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/12400.jpg) to be late.

[^604]: 124:3 Apayêi_n_ti, frastanvai_n_ti, framanyêi_n_tê: these are three technical words for the movements of the three classes of soldiers, footmen, horsemen, and chariot-men; the last two words are probably synonymous with the first, but the exact shades of meaning are not known. Mr. West suggests, cannot outrun, outride, outdrive him.

[^606]: 125:1 The sacramental words of the contract, by their not being kept, turn to evil spells against the contract: breaker.

[^607]: 125:2 Doubtful: _s_anamayô, or _s_anamaoyô; read shanmaoyô (?), from shan, Sansk. kshan.

[^608]: 126:1 Vahmô-sendah; cf. Vispêrad VIII (IX, 1), Phl. tr.

[^621]: 128:4 Doubtful (reading arena_t_\-_g_aêsha?).

[^622]: 128:5 See § 82, note.

[^623]: 129:1 Doubtful.

[^624]: 129:2 The cattle.

[^625]: 129:3 The meaning is, that the cattle of the Mithradru_g_es do not thrive, and that their pasture-fields are waste.

[^626]: 129:4 See Yt. XII.

[^627]: 129:5 As they flee from Mithra, they fall into the hands of Rashnu.

[^628]: 129:6 Thrâtâra; one might feel inclined to read thrâstâra, ‘the fear-striking;’ cf. § 36.

[^629]: 130:1 Cf. §§ 99-101.

[^631]: 130:2 Doubtful. The text is corrupt.

[^633]: 131:1 Doubtful.

[^634]: 131:2 Cf. § 8.

[^635]: 132:1 Bundahi_s_ V, 3 seq.; cf. Yt. XII, 13, and Yt. X, 13.

[^636]: 132:2 The Haraiti Bareza is the same as Hara Berezaiti.

[^637]: 132:3 Sîrôzah I, 9, notes 4 and 5.

[^638]: 132:4 Doubtful (mâyao_s_).

[^639]: 132:5 Cf. Yt. VIII, II, 24, and Yt. X, 74.

[^641]: 134:1 The text is corrupt (vasô-yaonâi inatãm?).

[^642]: 134:2 Eredhwô-za_n_gem: sud_ri__dh_agaṅghatâ, kila kârye yad pâdâbhyâm yu_g_yate kartum vyavasâyî _s_akta_s__k_a (Yasna LXII, 5 \[LXI, 23\]).

[^643]: 135:1 Kar_s_ô-râzanghem: kê_s_var vîrâi (Pahl. tr. ibid.).

[^644]: 135:2 From Ahriman; cf. Yasna XXIX, 6 (vyâna = vi_k_âri_s_n, vi_s_uddhatâ.)

[^645]: 135:3 Yaokh_s_tiva_n__t_: kâmakômand (possessing whatever he wishes for, Vend. XX, 1 \[3\]).

[^654]: 136:4 Or ‘invisible.’

[^655]: 136:5 The western Karshvare (see above, [p. 123](#p123), note [^575]); this seems to refer to the career of Mithra during the night; cf. § 95.

[^656]: 136:6 And rolling upon it.

[^657]: 136:7 Cf. Yt. XIII, 89, note.

[^658]: 136:8 And uplifted.

[^668]: 137:5 Doubtful.

[^667]: 137:6 The spine.

[^669]: 137:7 Cf. § 80.

[^670]: 138:1 They have worshipped him and he has consequently overcome the Mithradru_g_es; this accounts for the word rejoicing.

[^671]: 138:2 Cf. Yt. X, 55.

[^672]: 138:3 Iric; cf. linquo.

[^673]: 139:1 The Genius of Truth (Yt. XII); Mithra gives a dwelling to the truthful man in the same way as he destroys the dwelling of the liar (§ 80).

[^674]: 139:2 Cf. § 70.

[^675]: 139:3 Aipi vithi_s_i; Vedic api vyathis (VIII, 45, 29).

[^676]: 140:1 Yaokh_s_ti, the root of Persian nyô_s_idan, Pahlavi niyôkh_s_îtan, to hear; one might be inclined to translate ‘a thousand ears,’ or ‘a thousand hearings;’ but the meaning of the word must have been rather more general, as Neriosengh translates it (pra_n_idhi, IX, 8 \[25\]).

[^677]: 140:2 Dvâ_k_ina?

[^678]: 140:3 Pithê: m_ri_tyu (Yasna LIII \[LII\], 6).

[^679]: 141:1 Vâ_k_em, the so-called vâ_g_.

[^680]: 141:2 Most manuscripts have added here, from the preceding clauses, ‘with hands uplifted!’

[^681]: 141:3 An allusion to a myth in which Mithra was described as an Indra delivering the cows carried away by a V_ri_tra: Firmicus Maternus called him abactorem boum (De Errore Profan. Relig. V); Commodianus compares him with Cacus:

‘Vrtebatque boves alienos semper in antris
Sicut et Cacus Vulcani filius ille.’

\[paragraph continues\] (Apud Windischmann, Mithra, p. 64.)

[^682]: 141:4 See above, [p. 132](#p132), note [^609].

[^683]: 142:1 Haoma; cf. Yasna IX, 26 181\].

[^689]: 143:4 See Yt. V, 53; X, 11, 114; V, 53.

[^690]: 143:5 It should seem as if Mithra was supposed to retrace his steps during the night. The Hindus supposed that the sun had a bright face and a dark one, and that during the night it returned from the west to the east with its dark face turned towards the earth.

[^691]: 144:1 Cf. § 132.

[^692]: 144:2 See Vend. Introd. V, 19.

[^697]: 144:7 Cf. § 97.

[^698]: 145:1 Fravôi_s_; Parsi tradition translates large: frâz (tr. Phl.), buland (Asp., Yasna LVII, 15 \[LVI, 7, 3\]).

[^699]: 146:1 The Sind.

[^700]: 146:2 The Rangha or Tigris. The words âg_e_urvayêiti and nighnê, ‘he seizes, he beats,’ are the words used of the priest laying the Haoma in the mortar and pounding it with the pestle (Yasna, X, 2 \[4-5\]). The Sind and the Rangha are thus compared with the two parts of the Hâvana, the land between is the Haoma, and Mithra's arms are the arms of the priest.

[^701]: 146:3 Sanakê, an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον; opposed to the aodhas of the Rangha, Yt. XII, 19.

[^702]: 146:4 The Arabian sea (?). Cf. Yt. XII, 21.

[^703]: 146:5 Who has not a ray of the celestial light: here, the man of little faith.

[^704]: 147:1 See above, [p. 4](Sirozahs_1#p4), n. [5](Sirozahs_1#fn11).

[^705]: 147:2 Âsna: Sansk. su_s_îla ([p. 34](Yasts_1#p34), n. [4](Yasts_1#fn181)).

[^706]: 147:3 He who offers thee a good sacrifice; cf. § 108.

[^707]: 148:1 Doubtful.

[^708]: 148:2 He who offers thee a bad sacrifice.

[^710]: 148:3 Doubtful.

[^711]: 148:4 See Vend. Introd. IV, 8.

[^712]: 149:1 When it clashes with another.

[^713]: 149:2 Kahvãn.

[^714]: 149:3 See Yt. V, 53; X, 11, 94.

[^715]: 149:4 The chief of the sacerdotal order, the so-called Maubedânmaused.

[^716]: 149:5 Or ‘the contract is twentyfold . . . .,’ that is, twenty times more strictly binding than between any two strangers. This passage is one of the most important of the Avesta, as a short account of the social constitution and morals of Zoroastrian Iran.

[^717]: 149:6 Of the same gild (svapaṅkti, ap. Neriosengh).

[^718]: 149:7 Hadha-gaêtha, co-proprietors of a gaêtha (a rural estate).

[^719]: 150:1 Doubtful.

[^720]: 150:2 A fair recognition of the jus gentium.

[^721]: 150:3 The contract between the faithful and the Law, the covenant (?).

[^722]: 150:4 Reading \[h\]amahê ayãn.

[^723]: 150:5 The last clause is doubtful; the text is corrupt.

[^724]: 150:6 Prayer follows Mithra in his career, rising and setting with him.

[^725]: 151:1 Mithra.

[^726]: 151:2 The translation of this sentence is conjectural.

[^727]: 151:3 Thirty strokes with the Sraoshô-_k_arana (upâzana; see Vend. Introd. V, 59); it is an expiation (âkayaya_n_ta) which purges them from their sins and makes them fit for offering a sacrifice to Mithra. One may find in this passage the origin of the painful trials through which the adepts of the Mithriac mysteries had to go before being admitted to initiation (οὐκ ἂν οὖν εἰς αὐτὸν δυνήσαιτό τις τελεσθῆναι, εἰ μὴ διά τινων βαθμῶν παρελθὼν τῶν κοάσεων δείξει ἑαυτὸν ὅσιον καὶ ἀπαθῆ. Suidas s. v., ap. Windischmann, über Mithra, 68 seq.).

[^728]: 152:1 The sutûd yê_s_t; the last chapters of the Yasna, from LVIII \[LVII\] to end, according to Anquetil (Zend-Avesta I, 2, 232).

[^729]: 152:2 The first words of the Vispêrad.

[^730]: 152:3 Paradise.

[^731]: 152:4 Towards the abode of the Immortals.

[^732]: 152:5 Fed with ambrosia (ἀμβρόσιον εἶδαρ) like Poseidon's steeds (Il. XIII, 35; cf. Ovid, Metam. IV, 274).

[^735]: 152:6 Doubtful (simãm_k_a simôithrãm_k_a).

[^736]: 152:7 Metal. See Vend. Introd. IV, 33.

[^737]: 152:8 Upairispâta.

[^738]: 152:9 See Yt. XII.

[^739]: 153:1 See Yt. XVI.

[^741]: 153:2 See above, [p. 12](Sirozahs_1#p12), note [13](Sirozahs_1#fn94).

[^742]: 153:3 Cf. Yt. X, 70.

[^743]: 153:4 Or better, rushing before (pâiri-vâza; cf. the translations of pairi-da_h__v_yu, Yt. X, 744 and pairi-vâra, Yt. I, 19). Cf. Yt. XIV, 75.

[^744]: 153:5 The Genius of Fire.

[^745]: 153:6 See [p. 95](Yasts_8#p95), note [1](Yasts_8#fn468).

[^746]: 153:7 A golden point.

[^747]: 154:1 Cf. Yt. X, 96.

[^748]: 154:2 The text has, they go . . . .

[^749]: 154:3 See above, [p. 123](#p123), note [^575].

[^750]: 155:1 §§ 134-135 = § 97-98.

[^751]: 155:2 Cf. Yt. X, 32.

[^752]: 155:3 Doubtful. Possibly, ‘of a pious conscience.’

[^753]: 156:1 An unqualified priest; cf. Vend. IX, 47-57; XVIII, 1 seq.

[^754]: 156:2 Or, ‘whose house is great.’

[^755]: 157:1 See Yt. VIII.

[^756]: 157:2 Ashi Vanguhi (?); cf. § 68.

[^757]: 157:3 Who watches around countries: aiwida_h__v_yûm is translated ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/15700.jpg) (Pers. tr. of Mihir Nyâyi_s_).

[^758]: 158:1 Âda_h__v_yûm: ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/15800.jpg); cf. Yasna XXVI, 9 \[28\].

[^759]: 158:2 Pairida_h__v_yûm: ![](/image/book/Zoroastrianism/The_Zend_Avesta_Part_2/15801.jpg).

[^762]: 158:5 Cf. Sîrôzah I, 16.
