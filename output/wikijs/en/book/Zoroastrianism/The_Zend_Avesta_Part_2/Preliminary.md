## YA_S_TS AND SÎRÔZAHS.

THE word ya_s_t, in Zend yê_s_ti, means properly ‘the act of worshipping,’ the performance of the yasna; and it is often used in Parsi tradition as synonymous with yasna. But it has also been particularly applied to a certain number of writings in which the several Izeds are praised and magnified. These writings are generally of a higher poetical and epical character than the rest of the Avesta, and are most valuable records of the old mythology and historical legends of Iran.

The Parsis believe that formerly every Amshaspand and every Ized had his particular Ya_s_t, but we now possess only twenty Ya_s_ts and fragments of another [^2]. The writings known as Ya_s_t fragments, the Âfrîn Zartu_s_t, and Vî_s_tâsp Ya_s_t (printed as Ya_s_ts XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV in Westergaard's edition), are not proper Ya_s_ts, and have no liturgical character; they are not devoted to the praise of any Ized.

The order in which the Ya_s_ts have been arranged by the Parsis follows exactly the order of the Sîrôzah, which is the proper introduction to the Ya_s_ts.

## SÎRÔZAH.

Sîrôzah means ‘thirty days:’ it is the name of a prayer composed of thirty invocations addressed to the several Izeds who preside over the thirty days of the month.

There are two Sîrôzahs, but the only difference between them is that the formulas in the former are shorter [^3], and there is also, occasionally, some difference in the epithets, which are fuller in the latter.

<span id="p2">[<sup><small>p. 2</small></sup>]</span>

In India the Sîrôzah is recited in honour of the dead, on the thirtieth day after the death, on the thirtieth day of the sixth month, on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, and then every year on the thirtieth day from the anniversary day (Anquetil, Zend-Avesta, II, 315).

The correspondence between the formulas of the Sîrôzah and the Ya_s_ts is as follows:

&nbsp; | &nbsp;

1\. Ormazd. | Ormazd Ya_s_t (I, 1-23).
2\. Bahman. | Bahman Ya_s_t (I, 24-33).

4\. Shahrêvar. |

13\. Tîr. | Tîr Ya_s_t (VIII).

27\. Âsmân. | 
28\. Zemyâd. | Zemyâd Ya_s_t (XIX).
29\. Mahraspand. | 
30\. Anêrân. | 

The Ya_s_ts that have been lost are, therefore, those of Khshathra-vairya, Spe_n_ta-Ârmaiti, Ameretâ_t_, Âtar, Vâta, Asman, Mãthra-Spe_n_ta, and Anaghra rao_k__a_u. The second Ya_s_t, or Ya_s_t of the seven Amshaspands, appears to have been no independent Ya_s_t: it was common to all the seven Ya_s_ts devoted to the several <span id="p3">[<sup><small>p. 3</small></sup>]</span> Amshaspands, and, accordingly, it is recited on the first seven days of the month. One might suppose that it was originally a part of the Ormazd Ya_s_t, as the Amesha-Spe_n_tas are invoked in company with Ahura Mazda (Sîrôzah 1, 8, 15, 23). There may, indeed, have been several Ya_s_ts for one and the same formula of the Sîrôzah, as in all of these formulas more than one Ized are invoked: this would apply not only to the Ya_s_t of the seven Amshaspands, but also to the Vana_n__t_ Ya_s_t (Ya_s_t XX), which, in that case, ought to follow the Tîr Ya_s_t (see Sîrôzah 13).

Not every Ya_s_t, however, is devoted to the Ized whose name it bears: thus the Ardibehe_s_t Ya_s_t is mostly devoted to Airyaman; the Râm-Ya_s_t and the Zemyâd-Ya_s_t are devoted to Vayu and to the _H__v_arenô: but Airyaman, Vayu, and the _H__v_arenô are invoked in the same Sîrôzah formulas as Ardibehe_s_t, Râm, and Zemyâd, and a Ya_s_t is named from the opening name in the correspondent Sîrôzah formula.

The systematic order so apparent in the Sîrôzah pervades the rest of the liturgy to a great extent: the enumeration of Izeds in Yasna XVII, 12-4a (XVI, 3-6) follows exactly the order of the Sîrôzah, except that it gives only the first name of each formula; and the question may be raised whether this passage in the Yasna is taken from the Sîrôzah, or whether the Sîrôzah is developed from the Yasna.

The very idea of the Sîrôzah, that is to say the attribution of each of the thirty days of the month to certain gods, seems to have been borrowed from the Semites: the tablets found in the library of Assurbanipal contain an Assyrian Sîrôzah, that is, a complete list of the Assyrian gods that preside over the thirty days of the month [1](Sirozahs_1#fn4).

## Footnotes

[^2]: 1:1 The Bahman Ya_s_t (see Yt. I, §§ 24 and following).

[^3]: 1:2 In the greater Sîrôzah the names of the gods invoked are introduced with the word yazamaidê, ‘we sacrifice to;’ in the lesser Sîrôzah there is no introductory word, the word khshnaothra, ‘propitiation,’ being understood, as can be seen from the introductory formulas to the several Ya_s_ts.
