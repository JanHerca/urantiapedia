The Ya_s_t of the seven Amshaspands is recited on the first seven days of the week, that is to say, on the days consecrated to the Amesha-Spe_n_tas. In fact it is nothing more than an extract from the Sîrôzahs, being composed of the first seven formulas in their two forms: §§ 1-5 = Sîrôzah I, 1-7; §§ 6-10 = Sîrôzah II, 1-7. Then come four sections which are the original part of the Ya_s_t (§§ 11-15).

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced [^187]! . . . .

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good [^187] . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu_s_tra, one who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\], the holy and master of holiness [^187] . . . .

## I.

1 [^188]. To Ahura Mazda, bright and glorious, and to the Amesha-Spe_n_tas;

To Vohu-Manô; to Peace, whose breath is friendly, and who is more powerful to destroy than all other creatures; to the heavenly Wisdom, made by Mazda, and to the Wisdom acquired through the ear, made by Mazda;

2 [^189]. To Asha-Vahi_s_ta, the fairest; to the much-desired Airyaman; to the instrument made by Mazda; and to the good Saoka, with eyes of love, made by Mazda and holy;

<span id="p36">[<sup><small>p. 36</small></sup>]</span>

To Khshathra-Vairya; to the metals; to Mercy and Charity.

3 [^190]. To the good Spe_n_ta-Ârmaiti, and to the good Râta, with eyes of love, made by Mazda and holy;

To Haurvatâ_t_, the master; to the prosperity of the seasons and to the years, the masters of holiness;

And to Ameretâ_t_, the master; to fatness and flocks; to the plenty of corn; and to the powerful Gaokerena, made by Mazda.

4 [^191]. (At the Gâh Hâvan): To Mithra, the lord of wide pastures and to Râma _H__v_âstra.

(At the Gâh Rapithwin): To Asha-Vahi_s_ta and to Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda.

(At the Gâh Uzîren): To Apãm Napâ_t_, the tall lord, and to water, made by Mazda.

5 [^192]. (At the Gâh Aiwisrûthrem): To the Fravashis of the faithful and to the females that bring forth flocks of males; to the prosperity of the seasons; to the well-shapen and tall-formed Strength; to Verethraghna, made by Ahura, and to the crushing Ascendant.

(At the Gâh U_s_ahin): To the holy, devout, fiend-smiting Sraosha, who makes the world grow; to Rashnu-Razi_s_ta and to Ar_s_tâ_t_, who makes the world grow, who makes the world increase [^192];

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification!

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

<span id="p37">[<sup><small>p. 37</small></sup>]</span>

## II.

6 [^193] We sacrifice unto Ahura Mazda, bright and glorious; we sacrifice unto the Amesha-Spe_n_tas, the all-ruling, the all-beneficent.

We sacrifice unto Vohu-Manô, the Amesha-Spe_n_ta; we sacrifice unto Peace, whose breath is friendly, and who is more powerful to destroy than all other creatures; we sacrifice unto the heavenly Wisdom, made by Mazda; we sacrifice unto the wisdom acquired through the ear, made by Mazda.

7 [^194]. We sacrifice unto Asha-Vahi_s_ta, the fairest, the Amesha-Spe_n_ta; we sacrifice unto the much-desired Airyaman; we sacrifice unto the instrument made by Mazda; we sacrifice unto the good Saoka, with eyes of love, made by Mazda and holy.

We sacrifice unto Khshathra-Vairya; we sacrifice unto the metals; we sacrifice unto Mercy and Charity.

8 [^195]. We sacrifice unto the good Spe_n_ta-Ârmaiti; we sacrifice unto the good Râta, with eyes of love, made by Mazda and holy.

We sacrifice unto Haurvatâ_t_, the Amesha-Spe_n_ta; we sacrifice unto the prosperity of the seasons; we sacrifice unto the years, the holy and masters of holiness.

We sacrifice unto Ameretâ_t_, the Amesha-Spe_n_ta; we sacrifice unto fatness and flocks; we sacrifice unto the plenty of corn; we sacrifice unto the powerful Gaokerena, made by Mazda.

9 [^196]. (At the Gâh Hâvan): We sacrifice unto <span id="p38">[<sup><small>p. 38</small></sup>]</span> Mithra, the lord of wide pastures; we sacrifice unto Râma _H__v_âstra.

(At the Gâh Rapithwin): We sacrifice unto Asha-Vahi_s_ta and Âtar, the son of Ahura Mazda.

(At the Gâh Uzîren): We sacrifice unto Apãm Napâ_t_, the swift-horsed, the tall and shining lord, the lord of the females; we sacrifice unto the holy waters, made by Mazda.

10 [^197]. (At the Gâh Aiwisrûthrem): We sacrifice unto the good, powerful, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful; we sacrifice unto the females who bring forth flocks of males; we sacrifice unto the prosperity of the seasons; we sacrifice unto the well-shapen, tall-formed Strength; we sacrifice unto Verethraghna, made by Mazda; we sacrifice unto the crushing Ascendant.

(At the Gâh U_s_ahin): We sacrifice unto the holy, tall-formed, fiend-smiting Sraosha, who makes the world grow, the holy and master of holiness; we sacrifice unto Rashnu-Razi_s_ta; we sacrifice unto Ar_s_tâ_t_, who makes the world grow, who makes the world increase.

## III.

11\. Let the Yâtus be crushed, O Zarathu_s_tra [^198]! both Daêvas and men [^199].

Who is he in whose house, O Spitama Zarathu_s_tra! every Dru_g_ is destroyed, every Dru_g_ perishes, when he pronounces these words [^200]:

12 [^201] . . . . . . . . . ?

13\. It is he who takes the seven Amesha-Spe_n_tas, <span id="p39">[<sup><small>p. 39</small></sup>]</span> the all-ruling, the all-beneficent, as a shield [^202] against his enemies.

We worship the Law of the worshippers of Mazda; we worship the waters coming in the shape of a horse [^203], made by Mazda.

14-15. He has renounced trespasses and faults, O Zarathu_s_tra! he has renounced all trespasses and faults [^204], O Zarathu_s_tra! when he throws down [^205] the destroyer of Vohu-Manô and his words [^206], with a hundred times hundredfold, with a many times manifold preaching and smiting, and he takes away the Law of Mazda, that was carried away as a prisoner [^207], from the hands of the \[ungodly\], who are destroyed by his strength.

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good. . . .

16\. Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

I bless the sacrifice and the prayer, the strength and vigour

Of Ahura Mazda, bright and glorious, and of the Amesha-Spe_n_tas;

Of Vohu-Manô; of Peace, whose breath is friendly [^208] . . . .

<span id="p40">[<sup><small>p. 40</small></sup>]</span>

Of Asha-Vahi_s_ta, the fairest; of the much-desired Airyaman [^209] . . . .

Of Khshathra-Vairya, of the metals [^209] . .

Of the good Spe_n_ta-Ârmaiti and of the good Râta [^210]. . . .

Of Haurvatâ_t_, the master [^210] . . . .

Of Ameretâ_t_, the master [^210] . . . .

(At the Gâh Hâvan): Of Mithra [^211] . . . .

(At the Gâh Rapithwin): Of Asha-Vahi_s_ta [^211] . . .

(At the Gâh Uzîren): Of the high lord Apãm Napâ_t_ [^211] . . . .

(At the Gâh Aiwisrûthrem): Of the Fravashis of the faithful [^212] . . .

(At the Gâh U_s_ahin): Of the holy, devout, fiend-smiting Sraosha, who makes the world grow; of Rashnu-Razi_s_ta and of Ar_s_tâ_t_, who makes the world grow, who makes the world increase.

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . .

Give unto that man [^213] brightness and glory, give him health of body, give him sturdiness of body, give him victorious strength of body, give him full welfare of wealth, give him a virtuous offspring, give him long, long life, give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.
