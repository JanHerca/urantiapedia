ISAAC DE BEAUSOBRE, the Huguenot author of one of the best books ever written on Manichæism (_Histoire critique de Manichée et du Manicheïsme_, Amsterdam, 1734, 1739), was the one to make the only sound suggestions on the sources used by Mani for the compilation of his _Book of the Giants:_ the _Book of Enoch_, and the _Γραφὴ τω̑ν Γιγάντων_ which Kenan, a great-grandson of Noah, discovered lying in a field (vol. i, 429, n. 6). The latter work has been identified by Alfaric (_Les Écritures Manichéennes_, ii, 32) with a book whose contents are briefly indicated in the _Decretum Gelasianum_, p. 54, ll. 298-9 (ed. Dobschütz): _Liber de Ogia_[^1] _nomine gigante qui post diluvium cum dracone ab hereticis pugnasse perhibetur apocryphus_. Of the _Book of Enoch_, which was composed in the Hebrew language in the second century B.C., only an Ethiopic version, a few Greek fragments, and some excerpts made by the Byzantine chronographer Georgius Syncellus survive.[^2] Mani, who could hardly read the Hebrew, must have used an Aramaic edition based directly on the Hebrew text (see below, _Šhmyz’d_). He quotes mainly from the first part, which Georgius S. (p. 45, Fl.-R.) calls “the first book of Enoch on the Egrēgoroi”, but shows himself acquainted also with the subsequent chapters.[^3]

It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family,[^4] did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition. There can no longer be any doubt that the Iranian names of _Sām_, _Narīmān_, etc., that appear in the Persian and Sogdian versions of the _Book of the Giants_, did not figure in the original edition, written by Mani in the Syriac language.[^5] His disciples, who, it is well known, were in the habit of <span id="p53"><sup><small>[ p. 53 ]</small></sup></span> translating every word of a text (including the names of months, deities, etc.), seen fit also to “translate” the names of the giants. Thus _Sām_ is merely the translation of _Ohya_. However, they kept some of the original names (e.g. _Šhmyz’d_), and adapted some others (e.g. _Wrwgd’d_).[^1]

The story of the fallen angels and their giant sons needed little adaptation to be fitted into Mani's system. Of course, the heavenly origin of the _B’nē-hā-Elōhīm_[^2] of Genesis vi, 2, 4, the _’Εγρήγοροι_, of the _Book of Enoch_, did not square with Mani's conviction that no evil could come from good. Therefore he transformed them into “demons”, namely those demons that when the world was being constructed had been imprisoned in the skies under the supervision of the _Rex Honoris_. They rebelled and were recaptured, but two hundred of them escaped to the earth. Mani also used the term _’Εγρήγοροι_ (preserved in Coptic, see texts L, M, P, S), or rather _‘yr_ in Aramaic (once in a Middle Persian fragment, text D), but in Eastern sources they are mostly referred to as “demons” (Pers. _dyw’n_, Parth. _dyw’n_ in T 6, Sogd. _δywt_ in G, H 17, K 7, _cytyt_ in E, _δywt ZY ykšyšt_ in H. 16).

The puzzling clause of Genesis vi, 4: “The Nephilim were on the earth those days,” was interpreted by Mani in this fashion: “when the Egrēgoroi descended, the animals, or proto-animals, were already in existence.” Mani confused _nəfīlīm_ with _nefäl_ (_näfäl_) = _ἔκτρωμα_: see Nöldeke, _ZDMG_., 43 (1889), 536, who rightly referred to the formula of abjuration (_P.Gr._, i, 1461) where the giants and the “abortions” are mentioned in one breath. In Manichæan parlance, “abortion” (cf. also MPers. _’bg’ng_, Sogd. _pš’q_) is synonymous with “animal”.

We are therefore left with the _Gibbōrīm_, understood by Mani[^3] as “giants”. He probably used the equivalent Syriac word, _gabbārē_ (_gnbr’_), which his disciples translated as _γίγαντες_, _al-ǰabābirah_ in Arabic, MPers. and Parthian _k’w’n_, Sogd. _kwyšt_ = _kawišt_ (Sing. _qwy_, _kw’y_ = _kawi_); cf. _Sb.P.A.W._, 1934, 30. In Sasanian times the words derived from the Avestan _Kavi_ were generally understood as “giant”; see Benveniste, _MO_., xxvi, 214, and Polotsky in _Mir.Man._, iii, 901. Thus MPers. Parth. _k’w_ is freely used in Manichæan texts, e.g. of the Father of Light (M 40), of solar deities, of leading Manichæans (both in _Mir.Man._, iii), also of the First Man and Ahriman[^4] with reference to the First Battle (which therefore could have been described as a _γιγαντομαχία_).[^5] <span id="p54"><sup><small>[ p. 54 ]</small></sup></span> However, the word _k’w_ is applied only to men and such beings as are imagined anthropomorphous. Where one would translate _γίγας_ as _monster_, the Iranian equivalent is _mzn_, _Mazan_. Thus the _γίγας τη̑ς θαλάσσης_ (_Kephalaia_, 113 and notes), whose breathing operations are responsible for ebb and flow (cf. also Beruni, _India_, 203, 10-11), is called _Mzn ‘y_ (_z_)_rhyg_[^1] in Middle Persian (M 99, V 22-3). Accordingly, MPers. _mzn_ (adj.[^2] and noun) and the related words, Pahl. _mā̆zan_, _māzanīg_, Sogd. _mzny’n δyw_, Av. _māzainya-_,[^3] should be rendered as “monster”, or “gigantic, monstrous”.

The Egrēgoroi and their giant progeny are fought and vanquished by four archangels: Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, and Istrael (_Enoch_, 10, 1; or: Uriel, or: Fanuel). In the _Book of the Giants_ they are called “the four angels”. They are frequently invoked by name in Manichæan prayers (e.g. M 4 d 19, f 6; M 20), as _Rwp’yl_, _Myx’yl_, _Gbr’yl_, and _Sr’yl_ ( = Istrael).

There were no details about individual feats of the giants in the _Book of Enoch_. Mani filled the gap with the help of the above-mentioned _Liber de Ogia nomine gigante_. This _Ogias_ has been identified with _Og of Bashan_,[^4] who according to late sources lived five thousand years and managed to survive the Deluge, thanks to his giant size.[^5] But possibly stories that primarily appertained to _Ogias_ were transferred to the better known _Og_, owing to the resemblance of their names. The name of _Ogias_ is _’why’_ (_’wḥy’_) = _Ohyā̆_ (_Oḥyā̆_) in the Manichæan fragments, and this spelling is presumably more correct than that of _Ogias_. _Og_ (_‘wg_) indubitably would appear as _’wg_ (or: _‘wg_). Since Mani took _’why’_ from an Aramaic text, the ending of _Ogias_ cannot be regarded as a Greek addition.

Ogias fought with a _draco_, and so did Ohya; his enemy was the Leviathan (text N). Ohya and his brother Ahya were the sons of _Šhmyz’d_ (text H), i.e. _Στμιαζα̑ς_, the chief of the Egrēgoroi in the _Book of Enoch_; hence, _Στμιαζα̑ς_ is transcription of _šhm-_ (or _šḥm_ ?). In the Persian edition of the _Kawān_ Ohya and Ahya are “translated” as _Sām_ and _Narīmān_, but the original names are kept in one passage (A 60). The translator did well to choose Sām-Krsāsp, both with regard to Ogias' longevity (Sām is one of the “Immortals”) and to his fight with the dragon (Sām is a famous dragon-killer). In the Sogdian <span id="p55"><sup><small>[ p. 55 ]</small></sup></span> fragments the name of Sām is spelt _S’hm_ = _Sāhm_, as it is often in Pahlavi (_S’hm_[^1] beside _S’m_); Ṭabari has _Shm_,[^2] cf. Christensen, _Kayanides_, p. 130. Sāhm's brother is _Pāt-Sāhm_. This name may have been invented by the Sogdian translator in order to keep the names of the brothers resembling each other. Narīmān was evidently not known in Sogdiana as a brother of Sām. According to the _Book of the Giants_, the main preoccupation of Sām-Sāhm was his quarrel the giant _Māhawai_,[^3] the son of _Virōgdād_, who was one of the twenty ers of the Egrēgoroi.

_The Book of the Giants_ was published in not less than six or seven languages. From the original Syriac the Greek and Middle Persian versions were made. The Sogdian edition was probably derived from the Middle Persian, the Uygur from the Sogdian. There is no trace of a Parthian text.[^4] The book may have existed in Coptic. The presence of names such as Sām and Narīmān in the Arabic version proves that it had been translated from the Middle Persian. To the few surviving fragments (texts A-G) I have added two excerpts, the more important of which (H) probably derives from a Syriac epitome of the book. Naturally, Manichæan authors quoted the book frequently, but there is only one direct citation by a non-Manichæan writer (text O). With the exception of text O, all the passages referring to the _Book of the Giants_ (texts J-T) go back to Syriac writings (apparently). They are, therefore, to be treated as quotations from the Syriac edition. E.g. the Parthian text N is not the product of a Parthian writer who might have employed a Parthian version of the book, but was translated from a Syriac treatise whose author cited the Syriac text.

In their journey across Central Asia the stories of the _Book of the Giants_ were influenced by local traditions. Thus, the translation of Ohya as Sām had in its train the introduction of myths appertaining to that Iranian hero; this explains the “immortality” of Sā(h)m according to text I. The country of _Aryān-Vēžan_ = _Airyana Vaēǰah_, in text G (26), is a similar innovation.[^5] The “Kögmän mountains” in text B may reflect the “Mount Hermon”. The progeny of the fallen angels was confined in thirty-six towns (text S). Owing to the introduction of the Mount Sumeru, this number was changed <span id="p56"><sup><small>[ p. 56 ]</small></sup></span> (in Sogdiana) to _thirty-two_ (text G, 22): “the heaven of Indra . . . is situated between the four peaks (cf. G 21) of the Meru, and consists of _thirty-two_ cities of devas” (Eitel, _Handb. Chinese Buddhism_, 148, on _Trayastriṃśat_).

FRAGMENTS OF THE KAWĀN

_A. Middle-Persian_

M 101, _a_ to _n_, and M 911, fifteen fragments of a book, throughout small pieces from the centre of the pages. It has proved impossible, so far, to re-establish the original order of the pages. On purely technical grounds (size of the fragments, appearance of the margins, relative position of tears, stains, etc.), I at first assumed the following sequence: l-j-k-g-i-c-e-b-h-f-a-d-m-M 911-n. Being unable to estimate the cogency of these technical reasons now, because of the absence of any photographic material, I have decided to change the order of the first six fragments in the following way: c-j-l-k-g-i, in view of their contents.[^2] Unfortunately we do not know in what order Mani had told the story of the giants. The task of finding the original order is made still more difficult by the fact that besides the _Kawān_ the book contained one or two more treatises, namely: (1) Parables referring to the Hearers, and possibly (2) a discourse on the Five Elements (here (1) = lines 160 to the end, and (2) = lines 112-159). The only fragments that undoubtedly belonged to the _Kawān_ are c-j-l-k-g-i, while the position of the fragments e-b-h is particularly doubtful. It must be borne in mind that whole folios may be missing between apparently successive pages. In order to enable the reader to judge for himself, all the fragments (including the parables) are published here. The text is based on a copy I made nearly ten years ago (referred to in the notes as: Copy); a revision is not possible under the present circumstances.

## Footnotes

p. 52

[^1]: Numerous variants (p. 126, Dobschütz), e.g. _de ogiae, de oggie, diogiae, diogine, diogenes, de ozia, de ugia, de ugica, de ogiga, de eugia, de uegia, de eugenia,_ etc. In Migne's _Patrologia Latina_ the text is in vol. 59, 162-3.

[^2]: See Charles, _The Book of Enoch_, 2nd ed., 1912. For the Greek fragments (and Georgius S.) the edition by Flemming and Radermacher ( = _Fl.-R._) is quoted here. For Mani's use of the Enoch literature see my papers in _Sb.P.A.W._, 1934, 27-32, and in _ZDMG_., 90, 2-4.

[^3]: See below A 86-94, and compare G 19-21 with _Enoch_ 67, 4, and G 38 with _Enoch_ 17, 1; 21, 7; 54, 6; 67, 4-13. On chaps. 72 sqq. see _Sb.P.A.W._, 1934, 32.

[^4]: Namely the _Kamsarakan-k‘_ (mentioned often in the Armenian history of the fourth century) who claimed descent from the royal house of the Arsacids. This is clear from the Chinese-Manichæan text that preceded the _Fragment Pelliot_, now printed in the Taishô Tripiṭaka as No. 2141a, vol. 54, p. 1280A, but hitherto untranslated: "He was born in the country of Sulin ( = Babylonia), in the royal abode of _B‘uât-tiei_ ( = _Patī-g_), by his wife _Muân-i̯äm_ ( = _Maryam_) of the family of _Ki̯əm-sât-g‘i̯ɒn_ ( = _Kamsar_(_a_)_gān_)." The name Κάρασσα in the Byzantine formula of abjuration (Migne, _Patr. Gr._, i, 1468) may be corrupted from _Kamsar-_. Thus there is a grain of truth in the assertion in the _K. al-Fihrist_, 327, 31, that Mani's mother had belonged to the Arsacid house; ibid., _Maryam_ (ed, _marmaryam_) is given as one of her names.—It is not proposed to discuss the origin of Mani's father here.

[^5]: I have abandoned my earlier opinion on this point (_ZDMG_., 90, 4) which was based on insufficient material. The important Sogdian fragment, text H, was not then known to me.

p. 53

[^1]: See _BSOS_., viii, 583; _ZDMG_., 90, 4. \[Cf. also Bal. _girōk_, Geiger, No.107.\]

[^2]: Cf. also Parthian _bgpwhr’n_, Sogd. _βγpšyt_, lit. "sons of God" = angels (also fem. Sogd. _βγpwryšt_). Thus _bgpwhr_ has a double meaning in Parthian, it being (Sogd. _βγpwr_) also the translation of Chin. _T‘ien-tzŭ_, or rather of Skt. _devaputra_.

[^3]: Herein he differed from the common interpretation of the passage (Nephilim = giants), shared also by the authors of the _Book of Enoch_.

[^4]: M 41: _’br q’rc’r ’wṯ zmbg ‘stft cy ’whrmyzdbg qyrd ’d dyw’n: dw q’w’n ’wṯ dw nyw’n_.

[^5]: This word, in the anti-Manichæan book by Alexander Lycopolitanus, p. 8, 10, ed. Brinkmann, refers neither to the Manich. "First Battle", nor to Mani's _Book of the Giants_, as Cumont, _Rech._, i, 3; ii, 160 sq., erroneously states. Cumont goes so far as to say that in the quoted passage Alexander had given a summary of Mani's work, and Benveniste, _MO_., xxvi, 213, has repeated this statement. In fact, Alexander says that experts in Greek mythology might quote, from p. 54 the Greek poets, the _Greek γιγαντομαχία_, as a _parallel_ to the Manich. doctrine of the rising by the Hyle against God. In ch. 25 (p. 37, 13 sqq.) Alexander explains that such poetical fables about giants could not be regarded as a satisfactory parallel, because they were myths and meant to be understood as allegories. He then (37, 17) quotes the story of _Genesis_ vi, 2-4, which he provides with an allegorical explanation. But he ascribes it to the _History of the Jews_ without even mentioning the _Book of the Giants_. This shows conclusively that he had no knowledge of Mani's book.

p. 54

[^1]: Jackson, _Researches_, 37, 67 sq., has "poisonous mass"; cf. _OLZ_., 1934, 752.

[^2]: Hence the comparative _mzndr_ (e.g. _Mir.Man._, i) and the superlative Pahl. _mā̆zan-tum_ (e.g. _Dd_., p. 118, 12 ed. Anklesaria).

[^3]: Clearly to be derived from Av. _mazan-_ "greatness". Cf. also Jackson, loc. cit., on _mzn_. Hence, the first part of the name of _Māzandarān_ probably = "gigantic".

[^4]: Thus Dobschütz, _Decret. Gelas._, p. 305.

[^5]: Dobschütz, loc. cit., who quotes Fabricius, _Cod. pseudepigr._, 799 sq., and Migne, _Dict. des apocr._, ii, 649, 1295.

p. 55

[^1]: For example, _Men.Khr._, 68, 12; 69, 12, ed. Andreas; _Pahl. Yasna_, 9, 10 (p. 71, 19).

[^2]: _Shm_, of course, transcribes _S’hm_, not _S’m_.

[^3]: MPers. _m’hw’y_ A 7, with suff. _m’hwy-c_ A 19, Sogd. _m’h’wy_ C 15 ( = _Wrogdad oγlϊ_ in B). Hardly = _Māhōi_ (as suggested _ZDMG_., 90, 4), for the ending _\-ōi_ was pronounced _\-ōi_ also in the third century (cf. e.g. _wyrwd_ = _Wērōi_ in the inscription of Shapur, line 34). Furthermore, there was no Māhōi among the heroes of the Iranian epos (M. is well known as the name of the governor of Marv at the time of the last Yezdegerd). More likely _Māhawai_ was a non-Iranian name and figured already in the Aramaic edition of the _Kawān_; it may have been adapted to Persian. Cf. _Mḥwy’l_, Genesis, iv, 18 ?

[^4]: But see _Mir.Man._, iii, 858 (b 134 sqq.).

[^5]: The children of the Egrēgoroi share with the inhabitants of Airyana Vaēǰah the distinction of being regarded as the inventors (or first users) of the arts and crafts. For the spelling of _Aryān-Vēžan_ see also Appendix, text U. It is not clear whether _Yima_ (text V) had been given a place in the Sogdian _Kawān_. _Ymyẖ_, i.e. _Imi_, is the correct Sogdian form of the name.

p. 56

[^1]: This system of notation has been used also in my book _Sogdica_, and in my paper in _BSOS_., X, pp. 941 sqq. The various interpunction marks are uniformly represented by oo here.

[^2]: But possibly _Frg. i_ should occupy the first place; see below, notes on lines 95-111.

p. 60

[^1]: = far less than he could say. Cf. _əž hazār yak, ŠGV.,_ xiv, 2, _əž hazāra̢ baewara̢ yak_, ibid., xvi, 1. Salemann, _Zap. Imp. Ak. Nauk, sér. viii, t. vi, No._ 6, 25, quoted Persian _az hazār yakī va az bisyār andakī_.

[^2]: The texts _B_ and _C_ (Uygur and Sogdian) could be inserted here (or hereabouts).

[^3]: Probably one of the twenty "decarchs" (_Enoch_ 6, 7), viz. No. 4 _Kokabiel_ = _Χωχαριήλ_ in the Greek fragments, and _Χωβαβιήλ_ apud Syncellus.

[^4]: This also could be a "decarch", _Arakib- ’Αρακιήλ_, or _Aramiel- ‘Ραμιήλ_.

[^5]: Incomplete name.

[^6]: Cf. Enoch 7, 5.

[^7]: _txtg_ might be appellative, = "a board". This would fit in three of the passages, but hardly in the fourth.

[^8]: Evidently this is the dream that Enoch reads in the fragment M 625c ( = Text D, below), which therefore probably belonged to the _Kawān_. It should be inserted here.

p. 61

[^1]: Here (or hereabouts) the texts E and F should be entered, both of which deal with the judgment on the fallen angels. Text F approximates to _Enoch_, ch. 10 (pronouncement of the judgment by God), while Text E is nearer to _Enoch_, ch. 13 (communication of the judgment the angels by Enoch).

[^2]: = _Enoch_, 12, 4-5: _εἰπὲ τοι̑ς ἐγρηγόροις . . . . οὐκ ἔσται ὑμι̑ν εἰρήνη_.

[^3]: = _Enoch_, 13, 1-2: _ὁ δὲ ’Ενώχ . . . ει̑πεν . . . οὐκ ἔσται σοι εἰρήνη κρι̑μα μέγα ἐξη̑λθεν κατὰ σου̑ δη̑σαί σε . . . περί . . . τη̑ς ἀδικίας καὶ τη̑ς ἀμαρτίας κτλ_.

[^4]: = _Enoch_, 14, 6: _ἴδητε τὴν ἀπώλειαν τω̑ν υἱω̑ν ὑμω̑ν_.

[^5]: = Syncellus, pp. 44-5 Fl.-R. (_ad cap._ xvi), cf. _Genesis_, vi, 3. _ἀπολου̑νται οἱ ἀγαπητοὶ ὑμω̑ν . . . . ὅτι πα̑σαι αἱ ἡμέραι τη̑ς ζωη̑ς αὐτω̑ν ἀπὸ του̑ νυ̑ν οὐ μὴ ἔσονται πλείω τω̑ν ἑκατὸν εἴκοσιν ἐτω̑ν_.

[^6]: In Jewish Persian _trwš_ is "ram" (Lagarde, _Pers. Stud._, 73), but in the dialect of Rīšahr nr. Bushire (according to the notes made on this dialect by Andreas about seventy years ago) tîštär is "a young she-goat". See _JRAS_., 1942, 248. \[_trwš_, Is. 1^11^, Ier. 51^40^ = Hebr. ‘attūd, probably understood as "he-goat".\]

[^7]: These lines evidently refer to the promise of peace and plenty that concludes the divine judgment in _Enoch_, 10. Hence = "each pair of those animals shall have two hundred young"?

[^8]: _sārišn_: cf. _DkM_. 487_apu_.-488, 3, "when they provoke (_sārēn-_) him he does not get irritated (_sār-_ and better, _sārih-_)." _GrBd_. 5, 8, "if you do not provoke, or instigate (_sārēn-_) a fight" (differently Nyberg, ii, 202). _sār-_, if from _sarəd-_ (Skt. _śardh-_), is presumably the transitive to _syrydn_ (from _srdhya-_ according to Bartholomæ), cf. _NGGW_., 1932, 215, n. 3.

[^9]: Cf. _Enoch_, 10, 19: _ἡ ἄμπελος_ \[sic\] _ἣν ἂν φυτεύσωσιν ποιήσουσιν πρόχους οἴνου χιλιάδας . . . . ἐλαίας . . . ._

[^10]: _ty_ or _ty_\[_y_\] = _tai_ from _taih_ from _taiγ_ (cf. _GGA_., 1935, 18), is ambiguous: (1) sharp instrument, (2) burning, glow, brightness, sunrays, etc. So also is _tyzyy_: (1) sharpness, (2) speed. One could also restore _ty_\[_gr_\].

[^11]: Lit. "but the Wing(s) that (is, are) with him." The curious expression was chosen probably on account of the rhythm. For the same reason _byc_ is employed in the place of _’n’y_ in line 73.

[^12]: Lit. "beats".

[^13]: _‘ystyh-_ is obviously different from _‘styh-_ (on which see _BSOS_., IX, 81), and possibly derived from _‘yst-_, cf. _z’yh-_ "to be born" from _z’y-_ "to be born". _‘ystyh-_ is met with in _W.-L._, ii, 558, p. 62 Ri 25, "blessed chief who stands (_‘ystyhyd_ ?) as the sign of the Light Gods." Lentz has _‘ystyhnd_, but without having seen the manuscript one may presume a misreading (cf. ibid., R i l, Lentz: _pd_\[ . . \]_dg_, but probably _pr_\[_’d_\]_ng_, R i 2, Lentz: _p.d’r_, but probably _pyr’r_, ibid., R ii 22, Lentz: _’n.z_, but probably _’’wn_; for further cases see _OLZ_., 1934, 10).

p. 62

[^1]: St. John, 13, 18.

[^2]: _phrystn: phryz-_ = Parth. _prx’štn: prxyz-_ (cf. Av. _pārihaēza-_, Sogd. _pr-γyž_; Parth. _’x’št_: MPers. _’xyst_) is mostly "to stand around, to be about, _versari_", sometimes "to stand around for the purpose of looking after someone" = "serve, nurse, protect", often merely "to be". _phryz-_ "to stand off, to abstain" is presumably different (_para-haēza-_).

[^3]: The series of visions in which Enoch sees the arrangements for the punishment of the fallen angels, etc., and of "the kings and the Mighty" (chaps. xvii sqq.), follows immediately upon the announcement of the divine judgment. Hence, frgg. _k-g_ must be placed after frg. l. Text G (below), which describes, the execution of the divine order, could perhaps be inserted here.

[^4]: It is difficult to decide whether this fragment should be placed at the end or at the beginning of the book. The 400,000 Righteous may have perished when the Egrēgoroi descended to the earth. The "choosing of beautiful women", etc., strongly suggests the misbehaviour of the Egrēgoroi on their arrival upon the earth. The hard labour imposed on the Mesenians and other nations may be due to the insatiable needs of their giant progeny (_Enoch_, 7, 2 sqq.). On the other hand, "fire, naphtha, and brimstone" are only mentioned as the weapons with which the archangels overcame the Egrēgoroi, after a prolonged and heavy fight (Text G, 38), and the 400,000 Righteous may well have been the innocent non-combatant victims of this battle which may have had a demoralizing effect even upon the _electae_. To clear up the debris the archangels would naturally commandeer the men. We do not know whether Mani believed Enoch to have been moved out of sight (_ἐλήμφθη Enoch_, 12, 1) before the Egrēgoroi appeared, or before they were punished.

p. 63

[^1]: _py_(_y_) always = nerves, sinews (not "fat" as in _Mir.Man._, i, etc., as alternative rendering). It is equivalent to _nerfs_ (Chavannes-Pelliot, _Traité Man._, 32/3 \[528/9\]), Uygur _singir_ (_T.M._, iii, 18/9), Copt. = _Sehne_ (_Keph_., 96, etc.), Sogd. _pδδw’_ (unpubl.). Cf. also _GrBd_., 196, 4, where Goetze, _ZII_., ii, 70, wrongly has "fat". MPers. _pai_ = NPers. _pai_ = Pashto _pala_ = Sogd. _pδδw’_ (not Av. _piθwā-_).

[^2]: Hardly "to". Cf. Cumont, _Rech_., i, 49, and my paper _NGGW_., 1932, 224.

[^3]: Or: over the Just God, sun and moon, the (_or_: his) two flames. The "Just God" is the Messenger (not = _bgr’štygr_, i.e. Zrwān).

[^4]: Unintelligible. Lit. ". . . two flames given into the (_or_: his) hand".

[^5]: Cf. _Sb.P.A.W._, 1934, 27, and _BSOS_., VIII, 585.

[^6]: Cf. M 171, 32 sqq. _’wṯ ’st ngwš’g ky ’w ’b_\[_w_\](../_r_)\[_s_\] _m’nh’g ky hmyw zrgwng ‘štyd ’wš zmg ’wd t’b’n png ny ryzynd. ’w’gwn hwyc hwrw’n ngwš’g pd pzd ’wd wšyd’x pd xw’r ’wṯ dyjw’r, kd dwr ’c wjydg’n ’wṯ kd nzd ’w wjydg’n, hw pd wxybyy frhyft ’wd w’wryft ‘škbyd_, etc. "And some Hearers are like unto the juniper which is ever green, and whose leaves are shed neither in summer nor in winter. So also the pious Hearer, in times of persecution and of free exercise (lit. open-mindedness), in good and bad days, under the eyes of the Elect or out of their sight,—he is constant in his charity and faith." Although the word _’brws_ is incomplete in both passages, its restoration is practically a certainty.

[^7]: Possibly the parable of St. Mark, iv, 3 sqq.

[^8]: _BSOS_., IX, 86.

p. 64

[^1]: An elaborate version of this parable is found in M 221 R 9-23: _u nywš’g ky h’n rw’ng’n ’w wjyydg’n ’’wryyd, ’’wn m’n’g c’wn ‘škwẖ myrd_ \[_ky_\] _dwxt ‘y nyq z’d hy, ’wd pd wryhryy ’wd ’gr’yyẖ ’byr hwcyyhr hy. ’wd h’n myrd ‘y ‘škwẖ ’w hwcyhryyẖ ‘y ’wy qnyycg xwyš dwxtr prg’ myyẖ cy ’byr h_\[_wcyhr_\] \[_h_\]_y. ’wd ’wy dwxtr ‘y hwcyhr_ \[  \]. _’wš ’w š’ẖ hndyym’n_ \[_qwnyẖ_\] _’wd š’ẖ ’wy qnycg ps_\[_ndyẖ_ ?\] _’wd pd znyy nš’yy. ’wš_ \[ \] _pws ’cyyš z’ynd_\[ \] _pwsryn ‘yš ’c ’w_\[_y myrd ‘y ‘š_\]_kwẖ dwxtr z_\[_’d_ (remainder missing), "The Hearer that brings alms to the Elect, is like unto a poor man to whom a pretty daughter has been born, who is very beautiful with charm and loveliness. That poor man fosters the beauty of that girl, his daughter, for she is very beautiful. And that beautiful daughter, he presents her to the king. The king approves of her, and puts her into his harem. He has \[several\] sons by her. The sons that were born to that poor man's daughter . . . .". Throughout the story the _parabolic optative_ is in use.

[^2]: For a similar parable see below, lines 258 sqq.

[^3]: _zyyg_: this word, hitherto unexplained, occurs in the _Šābuhragān_ (M 470 V 14, spelt _z‘yg_). The sinners, roasting in hell, see the Righteous enjoying the New Paradise, and ask them: _. . . ’wm’n . . . z‘yg ’w dst dyy_\[_d ’wd ’_\]_c ‘yn swcyšn bwzy_\[_d_\] ". . . put a rope (_or_: life-line) in our hands and rescue us from this conflagration". Cf. Pahl., Pers. _zīg_, Nyberg, _Mazd. Kal._, 68.

[^4]: Possibly "weapons".

[^5]: Cf. _Kephalaia_, 192/3.

[^6]: Cf. _āhīd-gar-ān_ below, F 43/4. For a discussion of _āhīd_ see Zaehner; _BSOS_., IX, 315 sq. Perhaps one can understand Av. _āhiti-_ as "something that causes shame", hence "stain", etc. In that case _Anāhitā_ could be compared to _Apsaras_. As regards NPers. _χīre_, mentioned by Zaehner, this may be connected with Sogd. _γyr’k_ "foolish". The word in _DkM_., 205^8^, is not necessarily _hyrg-gwn_ (thus Zaehner, ibid., 312). It might be _hyl-_ = Pashto _xəṛ_ "ashen, grey, etc."

p. 65

[^1]: Cf. _supra_, lines 206-212.

[^2]: On _boγuq_ see Bang, loc. cit., p. 15, who has: "the door of the closed (locked) sun." Acc. to _Enoch_, chaps. 72 sqq., there are 180 doors in the east one of which is opened each morning for the sun to pass through (the idea, familiar also from Pahlavi books, is of Babylonian origin).

p. 66

[^1]: Cf. _Enoch_, 13, 9, _ἠ̑λθον πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ πάντες συνηγμένοι ἐκάθηντο πενθου̑ντες κτλ_.

[^2]: Cf. _Enoch_, 13, 4-6.

[^3]: i.e. the divine order for their punishment (_Enoch_, 10).

[^4]: \[Other fragments of the same manuscript ("T i"), not however belonging to the _Kawān_, show that there were three columns to a page; hence, the correct order of the columns is: BCDEFA. Perhaps this text, too, is not a fragment of the _Kawān_.\]

p. 67

[^1]: _murzīdan_ is "persecute, harass", not "show pity" as hitherto translated (_S_ 9; _Mir.Man._, ii; _W.-L._, ii, 556, r 6).

[^2]: _ghwd_ (_Mir.Man._, ii), _ghwdg’n_ (_Mir.Man._, i), _ghwyn-_ (_ZII_., ix, 183, 27): the derivation of these words from _vi_ + _hū_ by Schaeder, _Sb.P.A.W._, 1935, 492, n. 3, is based on the translation I had given; this translation, however, was based on nothing but this selfsame etymology.

[^3]: _Enoch_, 10, 10.

p. 68

[^1]: This passage in particular seems to show that the text is a fragment of the _Kawān_. There are two groups of sinners here: one is (apparently) to be transferred from a preliminary fire-prison to the permanent hell at the end of the world ( = the Egrēgoroi), the other consists of the _κίβδηλοι_ ( = Giants). The digression on their final fate in the great conflagration, under the eyes of the self-satisfied Righteous (cf. _Šābuhragān_, _M_ 470 _V_), is well in keeping with Mani's discursive style.

[^2]: _w’y-_ (different from Parth. _w’y-_ "to lead") = "to fly" or "to hunt" ? Cf. _w’ywg_ "hunter" (_BBB_., where the translation should be changed), _Air. Wb._ 1356, 1407.

[^3]: My pupil I. Gershevitch thinks _prβ’r_ should be derived from _prβyr-_. It is true that "explanation, announcement" fits most passages better than "chariot"! Hence, Mahāyāna rendered as "the great announcement" ?

p. 69

[^3]: _Enoch_, 17,1: _ὅταν θέλωσιν φαίνονται ὡσεὶ ἄνθρωποι. pts’δ_, cf. Skt. _praticchanda-_.

[^4]: viz. the human associates of the demons, esp. the "daughters of men".

[^5]: viz. the giants and their children ? Or merely the children of the giants ? See below, _S_. to Syncellus (_apud Fl.-R._, p. 25) there were three generations: (1) the giants, (2) the Nephīlīm, their sons, and (3) the Eliud, their grandsons. In the _Book of Enoch_ the giants are killed, or rather incited to kill each other, before the Egrēgoroi are punished (ch. 10). Their spirits shall roam the world, until the day of judgement, as _πνεύματα πονηρά_ (15,8-16,1).

[^6]: This passage shows that the Sogdian text had been translated from either Middle-Persian or Parthian (MPers. _ky myhryzd ’c nwx ’wyš’n r’y wyn’rd bwd_, Parthian _ky w’d jywndg ’c nwx hwyn wsn’d wyr’št bwd_).

[^7]: _’nδyk_ probably = skill, art, ability (differently, _BBB_., p. 105).

[^8]: See above, A 97.

[^9]: Fairly cursive, difficult to read.

[^10]: Probably by assimilation from _Šamšai_ ( = _Šimšai_ in _Ezra_).

p. 70

[^3]: See above, G 28-9, and below, text M. According to _Enoch_, ch. 8, the fallen angels imparted to mankind unholy arts and undesirable knowledge, e.g. astrology, cosmetics, soothsaying, metallurgy, production of weapons, even the art of writing (ch. 69, 9).

p. 71

[^2]: Presumably the stellar demons.

[^3]: Cf. _JRAS_. 1942, 232 n. 6.

[^4]: If Mani's famous _Ertenk_ was indeed a picture-book, this _Vifrās_ may well have been the explanatory text published together with it; cf. Polotsky's suggestion, _Man. Hom._, 18, n. 1, on Mani's _εἰκών_ (but see _BBB_., pp. 9 sq.). There is no reason for "identifying" the _Ertenk_ with Mani's _Evangelion_ (Schaeder, _Gnomon_, 9, 347). The fragments of the _Vifrās_ (M 35, M 186, M 205, M 258, M 740, T ii K, T iii D 278) will be published at some other opportunity.

p. 72

[^1]: The point is that A eats or kills B, after B had finished C. A man killed his brother over the treaaure, but was killed by a third party, etc. The Great Fire will devour the bodily fire which had swallowed the "exterior fire". Hence, Ohya killed Leviathan, but was killed by Raphael.

[^2]: St. Wikander, _Vayu_, i \[1941\], 166, quotes my article on Enoch, and my paper in _ZDMG_., 1936, p. 4, and remarks that _eigentuemlicherweise_ I had forgotten Al-Ghaḍanfar's notice on Sām and Narīmān. Less careless readers will find Ghaḍanfar's notice quoted _in extenso_ on the page cited by Wikander.

p. 73

[^1]: See above, A 98.

[^2]: Cf. above. A 105 sqq.

[^3]: Presumably the number of years supposed to have passed from the time of Enoch to the beginning of the reign of Vištāsp. The date for Enoch was probably calculated with the help of the Jewish world-era, or the mundane era of Alexandria (beginning 5493 B.C.), or by counting backwards from the Deluge. Taking 3237 B.C. (but 3251 B.C. according to the Coptic chronology) as the date of the Deluge (see S. H. Taqizadeh, _BSOS_., X, 122, under _c_), and adding 669 ( = from Enoch's death to the Deluge according to the Hebrew Genesis), and subtracting the number in our fragment, 3,28\[8 ?\], from 3,237 + 669 = 3,906, the resulting date, 618 B.C., agrees perfectly with the traditional Zoroastrian date for the beginning of Vištāsp's reign (258 + 30 years before Alexander's conquest of Persia, 330 B.C.; cf. Taqizadeh, ibid., 127 sq.). From this one may infer that the famous date for Zoroaster: "258 years before Alexander" was known to Mani (Nyberg, _Rel. Alt. Iran_, 32 sqq., thinks it was invented towards the beginning of the fifth century).

[^4]: The name is possibly to be restored in _Türk. Man._, iii, p. 39, No. 22, R 5, where _wy.t’δlp_ was read by LeCoq.

[^5]: In quoting this text in _ZDMG_., 90, p. 5, I took _wyjn_ for what it seemed to be, viz. _Vēžan_. But as the appearance of _Bēžan_ in connection with Vištāspa is incomprehensible, I have now restored \[_’ry’_\]_n-wyjn_, see above, G 26.

p. 74

[^1]: For the spelling, cf. _kwdws apud_ Theodore bar Kōnay.

[^2]: _’mwst_ = _amwast_ = believer, faithful (not "sad" !), from _hmwd-_, Arm. _havat-_.

[^4]: Hardly "food" or "banquet" ? Cf. Parth. _’wxrn_, etc. Also Budd. Sogd. _’wγr-_ (_’wγ’r-_) Impf. _w’γr-_, Inf. _’wγ’wrt_, etc.) "to abandon" (_SCE_., 562; _Dhuta_, 41; P2, 97, 219; P 7, 82; etc., appears to be of no use here.

[^5]: Cf. NPers. _ǰehāniyān_.

[^6]: Cf. _Vd_., ii, 20 ? But the Manich. fragment appears to describe the election of Yima to the sovereignty over the world.

[^7]: Cf. _BSOS_., X, 102, n. 4.

[^8]: _šyrn’m_ is a _karmadhāraya_, = acclamation(s), cheering, cf. e.g. _Rustam frg._ (P 13, 5) _prw RBkw šyrn’m_ "with loud cheers"; it should not be confused with the _bahuvrīhi šyrn’m’k_ "well-reputed, famous" (e.g. Reichelt, ii, 68, 9; _šyrn’m’y_, ibid., 61, 2, cf. _BBB_., 91, on _a_ 11). But _šyrn’m_ is also "(good) fame", see e.g. _V.J._, 156, 168, 1139.
