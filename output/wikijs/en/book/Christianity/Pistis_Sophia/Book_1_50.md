## CHAPTER 41

<small>Jesus commendeth John.</small>

It came to pass then, when John had finished speaking these words to Jesus in the midst of his disciples, that he said unto him: “Well said, John, the Virgin, who shalt rule in the kingdom of the Light.”

<small>The emanations of Self-willed again squeeze the light out of Sophia.</small>

And Jesus continued again in the discourse anti said unto his disciples: "It came to pass again thus: The emanations of Self-willed again oppressed Pistis Sophia in the chaos and desired to take from her her whole light; and not yet was her commandment accomplished, to lead her out of the chaos, and not yet had the command reached me through the First Mystery, to save her out of the chaos. It came to pass then, when all the material emanations of Self-willed oppressed her, that she cried out and uttered the fifth repentance, saying:

<small>The fifth repentance of Sophia.</small>

“‘1. Light of my salvation, I sing praise unto thee in the region of the height and again in the chaos.

“‘2. I sing praise unto thee in my hymn with which I sang praise in the height and with which I sang praise unto thee when I was in the chaos. Let it come into thy presence, and give heed, O Light, to my repentance.

“‘3. For my power is filled up with **(68)** darkness, and my light hath gone down into the chaos.

“‘4. I am myself become as the rulers of the <span id="p56"><sup><small>[ p. 56 ]</small></sup></span> chaos, who are gone into the darknesses below; I am become as a material body, which hath no one in the height who will save it.

“‘5. I am become also as matters from which their power hath been taken, when they are cast down into the chaos,—\[matters\] which thou hast not saved, and they are condemned utterly by thy commandment.

“‘6. Now, therefore, have they put me into the darkness below,—in darknesses and matters which are dead and in them \[is\] no power.

“‘7. Thou hast brought thy commandment upon me and all things which thou hast decreed.

“‘8. And thy spirit hath withdrawn and abandoned me. And moreover by thy commandment the emanations of my eon have not helped me and have hated me and separated themselves from me, and yet am I not utterly destroyed.

“‘9. And my light is diminished in me, and I have cried up to the light with all the light in me, and I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.

“‘10. Now, therefore, O Light, wilt thou not accomplish thy commandment in the chaos, and will not the deliverers, who come according to thy commandment, arise in the darkness and come and be disciples for thee’?

“‘11. Will they not utter the mystery of thy name in the chaos?

“‘12. Or will they not rather utter thy name in a matter of the chaos, in which thou wilt not \[thyself\] purify?

“‘13. But I have sung praises unto thee, O Light, and my repentance will reach unto thee **(69)** in the height.

<span id="p57"><sup><small>[ p. 57 ]</small></sup></span>

“‘14. Let thy light come upon me,

“‘15. For they have taken my light, and I am in pain on account of the Light from the time when I was emanated. And when I had looked into the height to the Light, then I looked down below at the light-power in the chaos; I rose up and went down.

“‘16. Thy commandment came upon me, and the terrors, which thou didst decree for me, have brought me into delusion.

“‘17. And they have surrounded me, in numbers as water, they have laid hold on me together all my time.

“‘18. And by thy commandment thou hast not suffered my fellow-emanations to help me, nor hast thou suffered my pair to save me out of my afflictions.’

“This then is the fifth repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered in the chaos, when all the material emanations of Self-willed had continued and oppressed her.”

## CHAPTER 42

When then Jesus had spoken these words unto his disciples, he said unto them: “Who hath ears to hear, let him hear; and let him whose spirit seetheth up in him, come forward and speak the solution of the thought of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia.”

<small>Philip the scribe complaineth.</small>

And when Jesus had finished saying these words, Philip started forward, held up and laid down the book in his hand,—for he is the scribe of all the discourses which Jesus spake, and of all of that which he did,—Philip then **(70)** came forward and said unto him: “My Lord, surely then it is not on me alone that thou hast enjoined to take care for the world and write down all <span id="p58"><sup><small>[ p. 58 ]</small></sup></span> the discourses which we shall speak and \[all we shall\] do? And thou hast not suffered me to come forward to speak the solution of the mysteries of the repentance of Pistis Sophia. For my spirit hath ofttimes seethed in me and been unloosed and constrained me to come forward and speak the solution of the repentance of Pistis Sophia; and I could not come forward because I am the scribe of all the discourses.”

<small>Jesus explaineth that the appointed scribes are Philip and Thomas and Matthew.</small>

It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Philip, that he said unto him: “Hearken, Philip, blessed one, that I may discourse with thee; for it is thou and Thomas and Matthew on whom it is enjoined by the First Mystery to write all the discourses which I shall speak and \[all which I shall\] do, and all things which ye shall see. But as for thee, the number of the discourses which thou hast to write, is so far not yet completed. When it is then completed, thou art to come forward and proclaim what pleaseth thee. Now, therefore, ye three have to write down all the discourses which I shall speak and \[all things which I shall\] do and which ye shall see, in order that ye may bear witness to all things of the kingdom of heaven.”

## CHAPTER 43

When then Jesus had said this, he said unto his disciples: “Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.” **(71)**

<small>Mary interpreteth the words of Jesus concerning the three witnesses.</small>

Mary started forward again, stepped into the midst, placed herself by Philip and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, my in-dweller of light hath ears, and I am ready to hear with my power, and I have understood the word which thou hast spoken. Now, therefore, my Lord, hearken that I may discourse in openness, thou who hast <span id="p59"><sup><small>[ p. 59 ]</small></sup></span> said unto us: ‘Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.’

“Concerning the word which thou hast spoken unto Philip: ‘It is thou and Thomas and Matthew on whom it hath been enjoined—to you three by the First Mystery, to write all the discourses of the kingdom of the Light and thereto to bear witness ’; hearken, therefore, that I may proclaim the solution of this word. This is what thy light-power prophesied aforetime through Moses: ‘By two or three witnesses shall every matter be established.’ The three witnesses are Philip and Thomas and Matthew.”

<small>Philip is now given permission to speak.</small>

It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard this word, that he said: “Well said, Mary, this is the solution of the word. Now, therefore, do thou, Philip, come forward and proclaim the solution of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia, and thereafter take thy seat and write all the discourses which I shall speak, until the number of thy portion which thou hast to write of the words of the kingdom of the Light is completed. Then shalt thou come forward and speak what thy spirit shall understand. But do thou **(72)** then now proclaim the solution of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia.”

And Philip answered and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, hearken that I may speak the solution of her repentance. For thy power hath prophesied aforetime concerning it through David in the eighty-seventh Psalm, saying:

<small>Philip interpreteth the fifth repentance from Psalm lxxxvii.</small>

“‘1. Lord, God of my salvation, by day and by night have I cried unto thee.

“‘2. Let my weeping come before thee; incline thine ear to my supplication, O Lord.

<span id="p60"><sup><small>[ p. 60 ]</small></sup></span>

“‘3. For my soul is full of evil, my life hath drawn nigh to the world below.

“‘4. I am counted among them who have gone down into the pit; I am become as a man who hath no helper.

“‘5. The free among the dead are as the slain who are thrown away and sleep in tombs, whom thou no more rememberest, and they are destroyed through thy hands.

“‘6. They have set me in a pit below, in darkness and shadow of death.

“‘7. Thy wrath hath settled down upon me and all thy cares have come upon me. (Selah.)

“‘8. Thou hast put away mine acquaintances far from me; they have made me an abomination for them. They have abandoned me, and I cannot go forth.

“‘9. My eye hath become dim in my misery; I have cried unto thee, O Lord, the whole day and have stretched forth my hands unto thee.

“‘10. Wilt thou not surely work thy wonders on the dead? Will not surely the physicians arise and confess thee?

“‘11. Will they not surely proclaim thy name in the **(73)** tombs,

“‘12. And thy righteousness in a land which thou hast forgotten?

“‘13. But I have cried unto thee, O Lord, and my prayer shall reach thee early in the morning.

“‘14. Turn not thy face away from me.

“15. For I am miserable, I am in sorrow from my youth up. And when I had exalted myself, I humbled myself and arose.

“‘16. Thy angers are come upon me and thy terrors have brought me into delusion.

<span id="p61"><sup><small>[ p. 61 ]</small></sup></span>

“‘17. They have surrounded me as water; they have seized upon me the whole day long.

“‘18. My fellows hast thou kept far from me and my acquaintances from my misery.’

“This is then the solution of the mystery of the fifth repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she was oppressed in the chaos.”

## CHAPTER 44

<small>Philip is commended and continueth writing.</small>

It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Philip speak these words, that he said: “Well said, Philip, well-beloved. Now, therefore, come, take thy seat and write thy portion of all the discourses which I shall speak, and \[of all things which I shall\] do, and of all that thou shalt see.”

And forthwith Philip sat down and wrote.

It came. to pass thereafter that Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "Then did Pistis Sophia cry to the Light. It forgave her sin, in that she had left her region and gone down into the darkness. She uttered the sixth repentance, saying thus:

<small>The sixth repentance of Sophia.</small>

“‘1. I have sung praises **(74)** unto thee, O Light, in the darkness below.

“‘2. Hearken unto my repentance, and may thy light give heed to the voice of my supplication.

“‘3. O Light, if thou thinkest on my sin, I shall not be able to stand before thee, and thou wilt abandon me,

“‘4. For thou, O Light, art my saviour; because of the light of thy name I have had faith in thee, O Light.

“‘5. And my power hath had faith in thy mystery; and moreover my power hath trusted in the Light when it was among those of the height; and it hath trusted in it when it was in the chaos below.

<span id="p62"><sup><small>[ p. 62 ]</small></sup></span>

“‘6. Let all the powers in me trust in the Light when I am in the darkness below, and may they again trust in the Light if they come into the region of the height.

“‘7. For it is \[the Light\] which hath compassion on us and delivereth us; and a great saving mystery is in it.

“‘8. And it will save all powers out of the chaos because of my transgression. For I have left my region and am come down into the chaos.’

“Now, therefore, whose mind is exalted, let him understand.”


## CHAPTER 45

It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that he said unto them: “Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?”

Andrew came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning the solution of the sixth repentance of Pistis Sophia, thy light-power prophesied aforetime through David in the one-hundred-and-twenty-ninth Psalm, saying: **(75)**

<small>Andrew interpreteth the sixth repentance from Psalm cxxix.</small>

“‘1. Out of the depths I have cried unto thee, O Lord.

“‘2. Hearken unto my voice; let thine ears give heed to the voice of my supplication.

“‘3. O Lord, if thou heedest my iniquities, who will be able to pass \[the test\]?

“‘4. For pardon is in thy hands; for the sake of thy name have I waited for thee, O Lord.

“‘5. My soul hath waited for thy word.

“‘6. My soul hath hoped in the Lord from the morning until the evening. Let Israel hope in the Lord from the morning until the evening.

“‘7. For grace standeth by the Lord and with him is great redemption.

<span id="p63"><sup><small>[ p. 63 ]</small></sup></span>

“‘8. And he will deliver Israel from all his iniquities.’

<small>Jesus commendeth Andrew. He promiseth that the tyrants shall be judged and consumed by the wise fire.</small>

Jesus said unto him: “Well said, Andrew, blessed one. This is the solution of her repentance. Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: I will perfect you in all mysteries of the Light and all gnoses from the interiors of the interiors to the exteriors of the exteriors, from the Ineffable down to the darkness of darknesses, from the Light of lights down to the . . . . of matter, from all the gods down to the demons, from all the lords down to the decans, from all the authorities down to the servitors, from the creation of men down to \[that\] of the wild-beasts, of the cattle and of the reptiles, in order that ye may be called perfect, perfected in **(76)** all fulness. Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: In the region where I shall be in the kingdom of my Father, ye will also be with me. And when the perfect number is completed, so that the Mixture shall be dissolved, I will give commandment that they bring all tyrant gods, who have not given up the purification of their light, and will give commandment to the wise fire, over which the perfect pass, to eat into those tyrants, until they give up the last purification of their light.”

<small>Mary interpreteth the words of Jesus.</small>

It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that he said unto them: “Understand ye in what manner I speak with you?”

Mary said: "Yea, Lord, I have understood the word which thou hast spoken. Concerning then the word which thou hast said: At the dissolution of the whole Mixture thou shalt take thy seat on a light-power and thy disciples, <span id="p64"><sup><small>[ p. 64 ]</small></sup></span> that is ourselves, shall sit on the right of thee, and thou shalt judge the tyrant gods, who have not given up the purification of their light, and the wise fire will bite into them, until they give up the last light in them,—concerning this word then thy light-power prophesied aforetime through David, in the eighty-first Psalm, saying:

“‘God shall sit in the assembly (synagogue) **(77)** of the gods and try the gods.’”

Jesus said unto her: “Well said, Mary.”

## CHAPTER 46

<small>The repentance of Sophia is not yet accepted. She is mocked by the æons.</small>

Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass, when Pistis Sophia had finished uttering the sixth repentance for the forgiveness of her transgression, that she turned again to the height, to see if her sins were forgiven her, and to see whether they would lead her up out of the chaos. But by commandment of the First Mystery not yet was she hearkened to, so that her sin should be forgiven and she should be led up out of the chaos. When then she had turned to the height to see whether her repentance were accepted from her, she saw all the rulers of the twelve æons mocking at her and rejoicing over her because her repentance was not accepted from her. When then she saw that they mocked at her, she grieved exceedingly and lifted up her voice to the height in her seventh repentance, saying:

<small>The seventh repentance of Sophia.</small>

“‘1. O Light, I have lifted up my power unto thee, my Light.

“‘2. On thee have I had faith. Let me not be scorned; let not the rulers of the twelve æons, who hate me, rejoice over me.

“‘3. For all who have faith in thee shall not be put to shame. Let them who have taken <span id="p65"><sup><small>[ p. 65 ]</small></sup></span> away my power, remain in darkness; and let them not get from it any profit, but let it be taken away from them. **(78)**

“‘4. O Light, show me thy ways, and I shall be saved in them; and show me thy paths, whereby I shall be saved out of the chaos.

“‘5. And guide me in thy light, and let me know, O Light, that thou art my saviour. On thee will I trust the whole of my time.

“‘6. Give heed that thou save me, O Light, for thy mercy endureth for ever.

“‘7. As to my transgression, which I have committed from the beginning in my ignorance, put it not to my account, O Light, but rather save me through thy great mystery of the forgiveness of sins because of thy goodness, O Light.

“‘8. For good and sincere is the Light. For this cause will it grant me my way, to be saved out of my transgression;

“‘9. And for my powers, which are diminished through the fear of the material emanations of Self-willed, will it draw near after its commandment, and will teach my powers, which are diminished because of the merciless, its gnosis.

“‘10. For all gnoses of the Light are saving means and are mysteries for all who seek the regions of its Inheritance and its mysteries.

“‘11. For the sake of the mystery of thy name, O Light, forgive my transgression, for it is great.

“‘12. To every one who trusteth in the Light it will give the mystery which suiteth him;

“‘13. And his soul will abide in the regions of the Light and his power will inherit **(79)** the Treasury of the Light.

“‘14. The Light giveth power to them who <span id="p66"><sup><small>[ p. 66 ]</small></sup></span> have faith in it; and the name of its mystery belongeth to those who trust in it. And it will show them the region of the Inheritance, which is in the Treasury of the Light.

“‘15. But I have ever had faith in the Light, for it will save my feet from the bonds of the darkness.

“‘16. Give heed unto me, O Light, and save me, for they have taken away my name from me in the chaos.

“‘17. Because of all the emanations my afflictions and my oppression have become exceedingly manifold. Save me out of my transgression and this darkness.

“‘18. And look upon the grief of my oppression and forgive my transgression.

“‘19. Give heed to the rulers of the twelve æons, who have hated me through jealousy.

“‘20. Watch over my power and save me, and let me not remain in this darkness, for I have had faith in thee.

“‘21. And they have made of me a great fool for having had faith in thee, O Light.

“‘22. Now, therefore, O Light, save my powers from the emanations of Self-willed, by whom I am oppressed.’

“Now, therefore, who is sober, let him be sober.”

When then Jesus had spoken this unto his disciples, Thomas came forward and said: "My Lord, I am sober, I am plentifully sober, and my spirit is ready in me, and I rejoice exceedingly that thou hast revealed these words unto us. But indeed I have borne with my brethren until now, so that I should not anger them; nay <span id="p67"><sup><small>[ p. 67 ]</small></sup></span> rather I have borne with every one that he should come before thee and speak **(80)** the solution of the repentance of Pistis Sophia. Now, therefore, my Lord, concerning the solution of the seventh repentance of Pistis Sophia thy light-power hath prophesied through the prophet David in the twenty-fourth Psalm, thus

<small>Thomas interpreteth the seventh repentance from Psalm xxiv.</small>

“‘1. O Lord, unto thee have I lifted up my soul, O my God.

“‘2. I have abandoned myself unto thee; let me not be put to shame and let not mine enemies mock at me.

“‘3. For all who wait upon thee shall not be put to shame; let them be put to shame who do iniquity without a cause.

“‘4. O Lord, show me thy ways and teach me thy paths.

“‘5. Lead me in the way of thy truth and teach me, for thou art my God and my saviour; on thee will I wait all the day long.

“‘6. Call to remembrance thy mercies, O Lord, and the favours of thy grace, for they are from eternity.

“‘7. Remember not the sins of my youth and those of my ignorance. Remember me according to the fulness of thy mercy because of thy goodness, O Lord.

“‘8. The Lord is gracious and sincere; therefore fore will he instruct sinners in the way.

“‘9. He will guide the tender-hearted **(81)** in the judgment and will teach the tender-hearted his ways.

“‘10. All the ways of the Lord are grace and truth for them who seek his righteousness and his testimonies.

<span id="p68"><sup><small>[ p. 68 ]</small></sup></span>

“‘11. For thy name's sake, O Lord, forgive me my sin, \[for\] it is exceedingly great.

“‘12. Who is the man who feareth the Lord? For him will he establish laws in the way which he hath chosen.

“‘13. His soul will abide in good things and his seed will inherit the land.

“‘14. The Lord is the strength of them who fear him; and the name of the Lord belongeth to them who fear him, to make known unto them his covenant.

“‘15. Mine eyes are raised ever unto the Lord, for he will draw my feet out of the snare.

“‘16. Look down upon me and be gracious unto me, for I am an only-begotten; I am wretched.

“‘17. The afflictions of my heart have in-creased; bring me out of my necessities.

“‘18. Look upon my abasement and my woe, and forgive me all my sins.

“‘19. Look upon mine enemies, how they have increased themselves and hated me with unjust hatred.

“‘20. Preserve my soul and save me; let me not **(82)** be put to shame, for I have hoped on thee.

“‘21. The simple and sincere have joined themselves to me, for I have waited on thee, O Lord.

“‘22. O God, deliver Israel from all his afflictions.’”

<small>Jesus commendeth Thomas.</small>

And when Jesus had heard the words of Thomas, he said unto him: “Well said, Thomas, and finely. This is the solution of the seventh repentance of Pistis Sophia. Amēn, amēn, I say unto <span id="p69"><sup><small>[ p. 69 ]</small></sup></span> you: All generations of the world shall bless you on earth, because I have revealed this unto you and ye have received, of my spirit and have become understanding and spiritual, understanding what I say. And hereafter will I fill you full with the whole light and the whole power of the spirit, so that ye may understand from now on all which shall be said unto you and which ye shall see. Yet a little while and I will speak with you concerning the height without within and within without.”

## CHAPTER 47

<small>Jesus leadeth Sophia to a less confined region, but without the commandment of the First Mystery.</small>

Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had uttered the seventh repentance in the chaos, that the commandment through the First Mystery had not come to me **(83)** to save her and lead her up out of the chaos. Nevertheless of myself out of compassion without commandment I led her into a somewhat spacious region in the chaos. And when the material emanations of Self-willed had noticed that she had been led into a somewhat spacious region in the chaos, they ceased a little to oppress her, for they thought that she would be led up out of the chaos altogether. When this then took place, Pistis Sophia did not know that I was her helper; nor did she know me at all, but she continued and persisted withal singing praises to the Light of the Treasury, which she had seen aforetime and on which she had had faith, and she thought that it \[_sc._ the Light\] also was her helper and it was the same to which she had sung praises, thinking it was the Light in truth. But as indeed she had had faith in the Light which belongeth to the Treasury in truth, therefore will she be led up out <span id="p70"><sup><small>[ p. 70 ]</small></sup></span> of the chaos and her repentance will be accepted from her. But the commandment of the First Mystery was not yet accomplished to accept her repentance from her. But hearken now in order that I may tell you all things which befell Pistis Sophia.

<small>The emanations of Self-willed oppress her again.</small>

“It came to pass, when I had led her unto a somewhat spacious region in the chaos, that the emanations of Self-willed ceased entirely to oppress her, thinking that she would be led up out of the chaos altogether. It came to pass then, when **(84)** the emanations of Self-willed had noticed that Pistis Sophia had not been led up out the chaos, that they turned about again all together, oppressing her vehemently. Because of this then she uttered the eighth repentance, because they had not ceased to oppress her, and had turned about to oppress her to the utmost. She uttered this repentance, saying thus:

<small>The eighth repentance of Sophia.</small>

“‘1. On thee, O Light, have I hoped. Leave me not in the chaos; deliver me and save me according to thy gnosis.

“‘2. Give heed unto me and save me. Be unto me a saviour, O Light, and save me and lead me unto thy light.

“‘3. For thou art my saviour and wilt lead me unto thee. And because of the mystery of thy name lead me and give me thy mystery.

“‘4. And thou wilt save me from this lion-faced power, which they have laid as a snare for me, for thou art my saviour.

“‘5. And in thy hands will I lay the purification of my light; thou hast saved me, O Light, according to thy gnosis.

“‘6. Thou art become wroth with them who <span id="p71"><sup><small>[ p. 71 ]</small></sup></span> keep watch over me and will not be able to lay hold of me utterly. But I have had faith in the Light.

“‘7. I will rejoice and will sing praises that thou hast had mercy upon me and hast heeded and saved me from the oppression in which I was. And thou wilt set free my power out of the chaos.

“‘8. And thou hast not left me in the hand of the lion-faced power; but thou hast led me into a region which is not oppressed.’”

## CHAPTER 48

<small>The emanations of Self-willed cease for a time to oppress Sophia.</small>

When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he answered again and said unto them: "It came to pass then, when the lion-faced power had noticed that Pistis Sophia had not been led up altogether out of the chaos, **(85)** that it came again with all the other material emanations of Self-willed, and they oppressed Pistis Sophia again. It came to pass then, when they oppressed her, that she cried out in the same repentance, saying:

<small>She continueth her repentance.</small>

“‘9. Have mercy upon me, O Light, for they have oppressed me again. Because of thy commandment, the light in me is distracted and my power and my understanding.

“‘10. My power hath begun to wane whiles I am in these afflictions, and the number of my time whiles I am in the chaos. My light is diminished, for they have taken away my power from me, and all the powers in me are tossed about.

“‘11. I am become powerless in the presence of all the rulers of the æons, who hate me, and in the presence of the four-and-twenty emanations, in whose region I was. And my brother, my <span id="p72"><sup><small>[ p. 72 ]</small></sup></span> pair, was afraid to help me, because of that in which they have set me.

“‘12. And all the rulers of the height have counted me as matter in which is no light. I am become as a material power which hath fallen out of the rulers,

“‘13. And all who are in the æons said: She hath become chaos. And thereafter all the pitiless powers encompassed me together and proposed to take away the whole light in me.

“‘14. But I have trusted in thee, O Light, and said: Thou art my saviour.

“‘15. And my commandment, which thou hast decreed for me, is in thy hands. Save me out of the hands of the emanations of Self-willed, which oppress me and persecute me.

“‘16. Send thy light over me, for I am as naught before thee, **(86)** and save me according to thy compassion.

“‘17. Let me not be despised, for I have sung praises unto thee, O Light. Let chaos cover the emanations of Self-willed, let them be led down into the darkness.

“‘18. Let the mouth of them be shut up, who would devour me with guile, who say: Let us take the whole light in her,—although I have done them no ill.’”

## CHAPTER 49

And when Jesus had spoken this, Matthew came forward and said: "My Lord, thy spirit hath stirred me and thy light hath made me sober to proclaim this eighth repentance of Pistis Sophia. For thy power hath prophesied thereof aforetime through David in the thirtieth Psalm, saying:

<small>Matthew interpreteth the eighth repentance from Psalm xxx.</small>

“‘1. On thee, O Lord, have I hoped. Let <span id="p73"><sup><small>[ p. 73 ]</small></sup></span> me never be put to shame; save me according to thy righteousness.

“‘2. Incline thine ear unto me, save me quickly. Be thou unto me a protecting God and a house of refuge to save me.

“‘3. For thou art my support and my refuge; for thy name's sake thou wilt guide me and feed me.

“‘4. And thou wilt draw me out of this snare, which they have laid privily for me; for thou art my protection.

“‘5. Into thy hands I will render my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, God of Truth.

“‘6. Thou hast hated them who hold to vain emptiness; but I have trusted.

“‘7. And I shall rejoice because of my Lord and make merry over thy grace. For thou hast looked down upon my humbleness and saved my soul out of my necessities.

“‘8. And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of my foes; thou hast set my feet on a broad space.

“‘9. Be gracious unto me, O Lord, for I am afflicted; my eye is distracted in the wrath and my soul and my body.

“‘10. For my years have wasted away in sadness and my life is wasted in sighing. My power is enfeebled in misery and my bones are distracted.

“‘11. I am become a mockery for all my foes and my neighbours. **(88)** I am become a fright for my acquaintances, and they who saw me, are fled away from me.

“‘12. I am forgotten in their heart as a corpse, and I have become as a ruined vessel.

“‘13. For I have heard the scorn of many who <span id="p74"><sup><small>[ p. 74 ]</small></sup></span> encompass me round about. Massing themselves together against me, they took counsel to take away my soul from me.

“‘14. But I have trusted in thee, O Lord. I said: Thou art my God.

“‘15. My lots are in thy hands. Save me from the hand of my foes and free me from my persecutors.

“‘16. Reveal thy face over thy slave, and free me according to thy grace, O Lord.

“‘17. Let me not be put to shame, for I have cried unto, thee. Let the impious be put to shame and turn towards hell.

“‘18. Let the crafty lips be struck dumb, which allege iniquity against the righteous in pride and scorn.’”

## CHAPTER 50

<small>Jesus commendeth Matthew and promiseth his disciples that they shall sit on thrones with him.</small>

And when Jesus had heard these words, he said: “Finely \[said\], Matthew. Now, therefore, amēn, I say unto **(89)** you: When the perfect number is completed and the universe is raised hence, I will take my seat in the Treasury of the Light, and ye yourselves will sit on twelve light-powers, until we have restored all the orders of the twelve saviours to the region of the inheritances of every one of them.”

And when he had said this, he said: “Under-stand ye what I say?”

<small>Mary interpreteth the words of Jesus.</small>

Mary came forward and said: “O Lord, concerning this matter thou hast said to us aforetime in similitude: ‘Ye have awaited with me in the trials, and I will bequeath unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath bequeathed it unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.’”

<span id="p75"><sup><small>[ p. 75 ]</small></sup></span>

He said unto her: “Well said, Mary.”

Jesus continued again and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass then thereafter, when the emanations of Self-willed oppressed Pistis Sophia in the chaos, that she uttered the ninth repentance, saying:

<small>The ninth repentance of Sophia.</small>

“‘1. O Light, smite down them who have taken away my power from me, and take away the power from them who have taken away mine from me.

“‘2. For I am thy power and thy light. **(90)** Come and save me.

“‘3. Let great darkness cover my oppressors. Say unto my power: I am he who will save thee.

“‘4. Let all those who would take away my light from me utterly, lack their power. Let them face about unto the chaos and become powerless, who would take away my light from me utterly.

“‘5. Let their power be as dust, and let Yew, thy angel, smite them.

“‘6. And if they would go into the height, let darkness seize upon them and let them slip down and turn to the chaos. And let thy angel Yew pursue them and cast them down into the darkness below.

“‘7. For they have set a lion-faced power as a trap for me, although I have done them no ill, from which its light will be taken; and they have oppressed the power in me, which they will not be able to take away.

“‘8. Now, therefore, O Light, take away the purification from the lion-faced power without its knowing it,—the thought which Self-willed hath <span id="p76"><sup><small>[ p. 76 ]</small></sup></span> thought, to take away my light; take away his own and let the light be taken away from the lion-faced power, which set the trap for me.

“‘9. But my power will exult in the Light and rejoice that he will save it.

“‘10. And all the portions of my power shall say: There is no saviour but thee. For thou wilt save me out of the hand of the lion-faced power, which hath taken away my power from me, and thou savest me out of the hands of them who have taken away my power and my light from me.

“‘11. For they have risen up against me, lying against me and saying **(91)** that I know the mystery of the Light which is in the height, \[the Light\] in which I have had faith. And they have constrained me, \[saying:\] Tell unto us the mystery of the Light in the height,—that which I know not.

“‘12. And they have requited me with all this ill because I have had faith in the Light of the height; and they have made my power lightless.

“‘13. But when they constrained me, I sat in the darkness, my soul bowed down in mourning.

“‘14. And do thou, O Light—for that reason sing I praise to thee—save me. I know that thou wilt save me because I fulfilled thy will ever since I was in my æon. I fulfilled thy will, as the invisibles who are in my region, and as my pair. And I mourned, looking unceasingly and searching for the Light.

“‘15. Now, therefore, have all the emanations of Self-willed surrounded me and rejoiced over me and sore oppressed me without my knowing <span id="p77"><sup><small>[ p. 77 ]</small></sup></span> \[them\]. And they have fled away and ceased from me but have had no pity upon me.

“‘16. They have returned again and made trial of me and they have oppressed me in great oppression and ground their teeth against me, desiring to take away my light from me utterly.

“‘17. How long, therefore, O Light, dost thou suffer them, that they oppress me? Save my power from their evil thoughts and save me from the hand of the lion-faced power; for I alone of the invisibles am in this region.

“‘18. I will sing praises unto thee, O Light, **(92)** in the midst of all who are gathered together against me, and I will cry unto thee in the midst of all who oppress me.

“‘19. Now, therefore, O Light, let not them who hate me and desire to take away my power from me, rejoice over me—who hate me and flash their eyes against me, though I have not done anything unto them.

“‘20. For indeed they have fawned upon me with sweet words, asking me concerning the mysteries of the Light which I know not, and have craftily spoken against me and been enraged against me, because I have had faith in the Light in the height.

“‘21. They have opened their chops against me and said.: Well indeed, we will take from her her light.

“‘22. Now, therefore, O Light, thou hast known their guile; suffer them not and let not thy help be far from me.

“‘23. Quickly, O Light, vindicate and avenge me,

“‘24. And give judgment on me according <span id="p78"><sup><small>[ p. 78 ]</small></sup></span> to thy goodness. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, let them not take away my light from me,

“‘25. And let them not say in their heart: Our power is glutted with her light. And let them not say: We have consumed her power.

“‘26. But rather let darkness come upon them, and let those who long to take away my light from me, become powerless, and let them be clothed with chaos and darkness, who say there: We will take away her light and her power.

“‘27. Now, therefore, save me that I may rejoice, for I long for the thirteenth æon, the region of Righteousness, and **(93)** I shall say ever-more: May the light of thy angel Yew shine more and more.

“‘28. And my tongue will sing praises to thee in thy gnosis my whole time in the thirteenth æon.’
