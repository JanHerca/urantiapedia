## CHAPTER 21

And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished saying these words, that Mary continued again and said: “My Lord, will not then the horoscope-casters and consulters from now on declare unto men what will come to pass for them?”

And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: “If the horoscope-casters find the Fate and the sphere turned towards the left, according to their first extension, their words will come to pass, and they will say what is to take place. But if they chance on the Fate or the sphere turned to the right, they are bound to say nothing true, for I have changed their influences and their squares and their triangles and their octagons; seeing that their influences from the beginning onwards were continuously turned to the left and their squares and their triangles and their octagons. But now I have made them spend six months turned to the left and six months turned to the right. He who then shall find their <span id="p24">[<sup><small>p. 24</small></sup>]</span> reckoning from the time when I changed them, setting them so as to spend six months facing towards their left and six months facing their right paths,—he who then shall observe them in this wise, **(31)** will know their influences surely and will declare all things which they will do. In like manner also the consulters, if they invoke the names of the rulers and chance on them facing the left, will tell \[men\] with accuracy all things concerning which they shall ask their decans. On the contrary, if the consulters invoke their names when they face to the right, they will not give ear unto them, because they are facing in another form compared with their former position in which Yew had established them; seeing that other are their names when they are turned to the left and other their names when they are turned to the right. And if they invoke them when they are turned to the right, they will not tell them the truth, but they will con-found them with confusion and threaten them with threatening. Those then who do not know their path, when they are turned to the right, and their triangles and their squares and all their figures, will find nothing true, but will be confounded in great confusion and will find themselves in great delusion, because I have now changed the works which they effected aforetime in their squares, when turned to the left, and in their triangles and in their octagons, in which they were busied continuously turned to the left; and I have made them spend six months forming all their configurations turned to the right, in order that they may be confounded in confusion in their whole range. **(32)** And moreover <span id="p25">[<sup><small>p. 25</small></sup>]</span> I have made them spend six months turned to the left and accomplishing the works of their influences and all their configurations, in order that the rulers who are in the æons and in their spheres and in their heavens and in all their regions, may be confounded in confusion and deluded in delusion, so that they may not understand their own paths.”

## CHAPTER 22

<small>Philip questioneth Jesus.</small>

It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished saying these words, while Philip sat and wrote all the words that Jesus spake,—thereafter then it came to pass that Philip came forward, fell down and adored the feet of Jesus, saying: “My Lord and Saviour, grant me authority to discourse before thee and to question thee on this word, before thou discoursest with us concerning the regions whither thou didst go because of thy ministry.”

And the compassionate Saviour answered and said unto Philip: “Authority is given thee to bring forward the word which thou willest.”

And Philip answered and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, on account of what mystery hast thou changed the binding of the rulers and their æons and their Fate and their sphere and all their regions, and made them confounded in confusion on their path and deluded in their course? Hast thou then done this unto them for the salvation of the world or hast thou not?”

## CHAPTER 23

<small>Why the path of the æons was changed</small>

And Jesus answered and said unto Philip and to all the disciples together: “I have **(33)** changed their path for the salvation of all souls. Amēn, amēn, I say unto you If I had not changed their path, a host of souls would have been destroyed, and they would have spent a long time, if the rulers of the æons and the rulers of <span id="p26">[<sup><small>p. 26</small></sup>]</span> the Fate and of the sphere and of all their regions and all their heavens and all their æons had not been brought to naught; and the souls would have continued a long time here outside, and the completion of the number of perfect souls would have been delayed, which \[souls\] shall be counted in the Inheritance of the Height through the mysteries and shall be in the Treasury of the Light. For this cause then I have changed their path, that they might be deluded and fall into agitation and yield up the power which is in the matter of their world and which they fashion into souls, in order that those who shall be saved, might be quickly purified and raised on high, they and the whole power, and that those who shall not be saved, might be quickly destroyed.”

## CHAPTER 24

<small>Mary questioneth him again.</small>

It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that Mary, the fair in her discourse and the blessed one, came forward, fell at the feet of Jesus and said: “My Lord, suffer me that I speak before thee, and be **(34)** not wroth with me, if oft I give thee trouble questioning thee.”

The Saviour, full of compassion, answered and said unto Mary: “Speak the word which thou willest, and I will reveal it to thee in all openness.”

Mary answered and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, in what way will the souls have delayed themselves here outside, and in what type will they be quickly purified?”

## CHAPTER 25

<small>The coming of Melchisedec.</small>

And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "Well said, Mary; thou questionest finely with thy excellent question, and thou throwest light on all things with surety and precision. Now, <span id="p27">[<sup><small>p. 27</small></sup>]</span> therefore, from now on will I hide nothing from you, but I will reveal unto you all things with surety and openness. Hearken then, Mary, and give ear, all ye disciples: Before I made proclamation to all the rulers of the æons and to all the rulers of the Fate and Of the sphere, they were all bound in their bonds and in their spheres and in their seals, as Yew, the Overseer of the Light, had bound them from the beginning; and every one of them remained in his order, and every one journeyed according to his course, as Yew, the Overseer of the Light, had established them. And when the time of the number of Melchisedec, the great Receiver of the Light,  came, he was wont to come into the midst of the æons and of all the rulers **(35)** who are bound in the sphere and in the Fate, and he carried away the purification of the light from all the rulers of the æons and from all the rulers of the Fate and from those of the sphere—for he carried away then that which brings them into agitation—and he set in motion the hastener who is over them, and made them turn their circles swiftly, and he \[_sc._ the hastener\] carried away their power which was in them and the breath of their mouth and the tears \[lit. waters\] of their eyes and the sweat of their bodies.

<small>Of the fashioning of the souls of men.</small>

“And Melchisedec, the Receiver of the Light; purifieth those powers and carrieth their light into the Treasury of the Light, while the servitors of all the rulers gather together all matter from them all; and the servitors of all the rulers of the Fate and the servitors of the sphere which is below the æons, take it and fashion it into souls of men and cattle and reptiles and wild-beasts and birds, <span id="p28">[<sup><small>p. 28</small></sup>]</span> and send them down into the world of mankind. And further the receivers of the sun and the receivers of the moon, if they look above and see the configurations of the paths of the æons and the configurations of the Fate and those of the sphere, then they take from them the light-power; and the **(36)** receivers of the sun get it ready and deposit it, until they hand it over to the receivers of Melchisedec, the Light-purifier. And their material refuse they bring to the sphere which is below the æons, and fashion it into \[souls of\] men, and fashion it also into souls of reptiles and of cattle and of wild-beasts and of birds, according to the circle of the rulers of that sphere and according to all the configurations of its revolution, and they cast them into this world of mankind, and they become souls in this region, as I have just said unto you.

## CHAPTER 26

“This then they accomplished continuously before their power was diminished in them and they waned and became exhausted, or powerless. It came to pass then, when they became powerless, that their power began to cease in them, so that they became exhausted in their power, and their light, which was in their region, ceased and their kingdom was destroyed, and the universe became quickly raised up.

“It came to pass then, when they had perceived this at the time, and when the number of the cipher of Melchisedec, the Receiver \[of the Light\], happened, then had he to come out again and enter into the midst of the rulers of all the æons and into the midst of all the rulers of the Fate and of those of the sphere; and he threw them into agitation, and made them quickly abandon <span id="p29">[<sup><small>p. 29</small></sup>]</span> their circles. And forthwith they were constrained, and cast forth the power out of themselves, out of the breath of their mouth and the tears of their eyes and the sweat of their bodies.

<small>The rulers devour their matter so that souls may not be fashioned.</small>

“And Melchisedec, the Receiver of the Light, purifieth them, as he doth continually; he carrieth their light into the Treasury of the Light. And all the rulers of the æons and the rulers of the Fate and those of the sphere turn to the matter of their refuse; they devour it and do not let it go and become souls in the world. They devour then their matter, so that they may not become powerless and exhausted and their power cease in them and their kingdom become destroyed, but in order that they may delay and linger a long time until the completion of the number of the perfect souls who shall be in the Treasury of the Light.

## CHAPTER 27

“It came to pass then, when the rulers of the æons and those of the Fate and those of the sphere continued to carry out this type,—turning on themselves, devouring the refuse of their matter, and not allowing souls to be born into the world of mankind, in order that they might delay in being rulers, and that the powers which are in their powers, that is the souls, might spend a long time here outside,—they then persisted doing this continually for two circles.

<small>Adamas and the tyrants fight against the light-vesture.</small>

“It came to pass then, when I wished to ascend for the ministry for the sake of which I was called **(38)** by command of the First Mystery, that I came up into the midst of the tyrants of the rulers of the twelve æons, with my light-vesture <span id="p30">[<sup><small>p. 30</small></sup>]</span> about me, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was about me.

“It came to pass then, when those tyrants saw the great light which was about me, that the great Adamas, the Tyrant, and all the tyrants of the twelve æons, all together began to fight against the light of my vesture, desiring to hold it fast among them, in order to delay in their rulership. This then they did, not knowing against whom they fought.

<small>Jesus taketh from them a third of their power and changeth their course.</small>

“When then they mutinied and fought against the light, thereon by command of the First Mystery I changed the paths and the courses of their æons and the paths of their Fate and of their sphere. I made them face six months towards the triangles on the left and towards the squares and towards those in their aspect and towards their octagons, just as they had formerly been. But their manner of turning, or facing, I changed to another order, and made them other six months face towards the works of their influences in the squares on the right and in their triangles and in those in their aspect and in their octagons. And I made them to be confounded in great confusion and deluded in great delusion **(39)**\—the rulers of the æons and all the rulers of the Fate and those of the sphere; and I set them in great agitation, and thence on they were no longer able to turn towards the refuse of their matter to devour it, in order that their regions may continue to delay and they \[themselves\] may spend a long time as rulers.

<small>They no more have the power of devouring their matter.</small>

“But when I had taken away a third of their power, I changed their spheres, so that they spend a time facing to the left and another time <span id="p31">[<sup><small>p. 31</small></sup>]</span> facing to the right. I have changed their whole path and their whole course, and I have made the path of their course to hurry, so that they may be quickly purified and raised up quickly. And I have shortened their circles, and made their path more speedy, and it will be exceedingly hurried. And they were thrown into confusion in their path, and from then on were no more able to devour the matter of the refuse of the purification of their light. And moreover I have shortened their times and their periods, so that the perfect number of souls who shall receive the mysteries and be in the Treasury of the Light, shall be quickly completed. For had I not changed their courses, and had I not shortened their periods, they would not have let any soul come into the world, because of the matter of their refuse **(40)** which they devoured, and they would have destroyed many souls. For this cause I said unto you aforetime: ‘I have shortened the times because of my elect; otherwise no soul would have been able to be saved.’ And I have shortened the times and the periods because of the perfect number of the souls who shall receive the mysteries, that is to say, the ‘elect’; and had I not shortened their periods, no material soul would have been saved, but they would have perished in the fire which is in the flesh of the rulers. This then is the word on which thou dost question me with precision.”

It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that they fell down all together, adored him and said to him: “Blessed are we before all men, for unto us thou hast revealed these great exploits.”

## CHAPTER 28

<span id="p32">[<sup><small>p. 32</small></sup>]</span>

<small>The powers adore the light-vesture.</small>

And Jesus continued again in his discourse and said unto his disciples: "Hearken concerning the things which befell me among the rulers of the twelve æons and all their rulers and their lords and their authorities and their angels and their archangels. When then they had seen the vesture of light which was about me, they and their unpaired, then every one of them saw the mystery of his name, that it was on my vesture of light, which was about me. They fell down all together, adored the vesture of light which was about me, and cried out all together, saying: ‘How hath the lord of the universe passed through us without our knowing it?’ And they all sang praises together to the interiors of the interiors. And all their triple-powers and their great forefathers and their ungenerated and their self-generated and their generated and their gods and their light-sparks and their light-bearers—in a word all their great ones—saw the tyrants of their region, that their power was diminished in them. And they were in weakness and themselves fell into great and immeasurable fear. And they gazed on the mystery of their name on my vesture, and they had set out to come and adore the mystery of their name which was on my vesture, and they could not because of the great light which was about me; but they adored a little removed from me, and they adored the light of my vesture and all cried out together, singing praises to the interiors of the interiors.

<small>The tyrants become as the dead.</small>

“It came to pass then, when this befell among the tyrants who are below these rulers, that they all lost power and fell down to the ground in their æons and became as the dead world- <span id="p33">[<sup><small>p. 33</small></sup>]</span> dwellers with no breath in them, as they **(42)** became in the hour when I took from them their power.

“It came to pass then thereafter, when I left those æons, that every one of all those who were in the twelve æons, was bound to their order all together, and they accomplished their works as I have established them, so that they spend six months turned to the left and accomplishing their works in their squares and their triangles and in those which are in their aspect, and that further they spend another six months facing to the right and towards their triangles and their squares and those which are in their aspect. Thus then will those who are in the Fate and in the sphere travel.

## CHAPTER 29

Jesus entereth the thirteenth æon and findeth Pistis Sophia."It came to pass then thereafter that I ascended to the veils of the thirteenth æon. It came to pass then, when I had arrived at their veils, that they drew apart of their own accord and opened themselves for me. I entered in into the thirteenth æon and found Pistis Sophia below the thirteenth æon all alone and no one of them with her. And she sat in that region grieving and mourning, because she had not been admitted into the thirteenth æon, her higher region. And she was moreover grieving because of the torments which Self-willed, who is one of the three triple-powers, had inflicted on her. But this,—when I shall come to speak with you respecting their expansion, **(43)** I will tell you the mystery, how this befell her.

Sophia and her fellow-powers behold the light."It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia saw me shining most exceedingly and with no measure for the light which was about me, that she was in <span id="p34">[<sup><small>p. 34</small></sup>]</span> great agitation and gazed at the light of my vesture. She saw the mystery of her name on my vesture and the whole glory of its mystery, for formerly she was in the region of the height, in the thirteenth æon,—but she was wont to sing praises to the higher light, which she had seen in the veil of the Treasury of the Light.

“It came to pass then, when she persisted in singing praises to the higher light, that all the rulers who are with the two great triple-powers, and her invisible who is paired with her, and the other two-and-twenty invisible emanations gazed \[at the light\],—in as much as Pistis Sophia and her pair, they and the other two-and-twenty emanations make up four-and-twenty emanations, which the great invisible Forefather and the two great triple-powers have emanated.”

## CHAPTER 30

<small>Mary desireth to hear the story of Sophia.</small>

It came to pass then, when Jesus had said this unto his disciples, that Mary came forward and said: “My Lord, I have heard thee say aforetime: 'Pistis Sophia is herself one of the f our-and-twenty emanations, how then is she not in their region? **(44)** But thou hast said: ‘I found her below the thirteenth æon.’”

### \[THE STORY OF PISTIS SOPHIA\]

<small>Sophia desireth to enter the Light-world.</small>

And Jesus answered and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass, when Pistis Sophia was in the thirteenth æon, in the region of all her brethren the invisibles, that is the four-and-twenty emanations of the great Invisible,—it came to pass then by command of the First Mystery that Pistis Sophia gazed into the height. She saw the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light, and she <span id="p35">[<sup><small>p. 35</small></sup>]</span> longed to reach to that region, and she could not reach to that region. But she ceased to perform the mystery of the thirteenth æon, and sang praises to the light of the height, which she had seen in the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light.

<small>The rulers hate her for ceasing in their mystery.</small>

“It came to pass then, when she sang praises to the region of the height, that all the rulers in the twelve æons, who are below, hated her, because she had ceased from their mysteries, and because she had desired to go into the height and be above them all. For this cause then they were enraged against her and hated her, \[as did\] the great triple-powered Self-willed, that is the third triple-power, who is in the thirteenth æon, he who had become disobedient, in as much as he had not emanated the whole purification of his power in him, and had not given the purification of his light at the time when the rulers gave their purification, in that he desired to rule over the whole thirteenth æon **(45)** and those who are below it.

<small>Self-willed uniteth himself with the rulers of the twelve æons and emanateth a lion-faced power to plague Sophia.</small>

“It came to pass then, when the rulers of the twelve æons were enraged against Pistis Sophia, who is above them, and hated her exceedingly, that the great triple-powered Self-willed, of whom I have just now told you, joined himself to the rulers of the twelve æons, and also was enraged against Pistis Sophia and hated her exceedingly, because she had thought to go to the light which is higher than her. And he emanated out of himself a great lion-faced power, and out of his matter in him he emanated a host of other very violent material emanations, and sent them into the regions below, to the parts of the chaos, in order that they might there lie in wait for Pistis <span id="p36">[<sup><small>p. 36</small></sup>]</span> Sophia and take away her power out of her, because she thought to go to the height which is above them all, and moreover she had ceased to perform their mystery, and lamented continuously and sought after the light which she. had seen. And the rulers who abide, or persist, in performing the mystery, hated her, and all the guards who are at the gates of the æons, hated her also.

“It came to pass then thereafter by command of the First Commandment that the great triple-powered Self-willed, who is one of the three **(46)** triple-powers, pursued Sophia in the thirteenth æon, in order that she should look towards the parts below, so that she might see in that region his lion-faced light-power and long after it and go to that region, so that her light might be taken from her.
