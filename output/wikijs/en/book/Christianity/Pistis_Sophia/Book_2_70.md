## THE SECOND BOOK OF PISTIS SOPHIA

## CHAPTER 63

JOHN also came forward and said: “O Lord, bid me also speak the solution of the words which thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David.”

And Jesus answered and said unto John: "To thee too, John, I give commandment to speak the solution of the words which my light-power hath prophesied through David:

“‘10. Grace and truth met together, and righteousness and peace kissed each other.

“‘11. Truth hath sprouted forth out of the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven.’”

<small>John further interpreteth the same scripture.</small>

<small>Of Sabaōth, Barbēlō, Yabraōth and the light-vesture.</small>

And John answered and said: "This is the word which thou hast said unto us aforetime: ‘I have come out of the Height and entered into Sabaōth, the Good, and embraced the light-power in him.’ Now, therefore, ‘Grace and truth’ which ‘met together,’—thou art ‘grace,’ thou who art sent out of the regions of the Height through thy Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, in that he hath sent thee, **(127)** that thou mayest have mercy on the whole world. ‘Truth’ on the other hand is the power of <span id="p107">[<sup><small>p. 107</small></sup>]</span> Sabaōth, the Good, which bound itself in thee and which thou hast cast forth to the Left,—thou the First Mystery which looketh without. And the little Sabaōth, the Good, took it and cast it forth into the matter of Barbēlō, and he made proclamation concerning the regions of Truth to all the regions of those of the Left. That matter of Barbēlō then it is which is body for thee to-day.

“And ‘righteousness and peace’ which ‘kissed each other,’—‘righteousness’ then art thou who didst bring all the mysteries through thy Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, and hast baptized this power of Sabaōth, the Good; and thou didst go to the region of the rulers and didst give unto them the mysteries of the Height; they became righteous and good.

“‘Peace’ on the other hand is the power of Sabaōth, that is thy soul, which did enter into the matter of Barbēlō, and all the rulers of the six æons of Yabraōth have made peace with the mystery of the Light.

“And ‘truth’ which ‘sprouted forth out of the earth,’—it is the power of Sabaōth, the Good, which came out of the region of the Right, which lieth outside the Treasury of the Light., and which hath come into the region of those of the Left; **(128)** it hath entered into the matter of Barbēlō, and hath made proclamation concerning the mysteries of the region of Truth.

“‘Righteousness’ on the other hand which ‘looked down from heaven,’ is thou the First Mystery which looketh down without, as thou didst come out of the spaces of the Height with the mysteries of the Light-kingdom; and thou <span id="p108">[<sup><small>p. 108</small></sup>]</span> didst come down upon the light-vesture which thou didst receive from the hand of Barbēlō, which \[vesture\] is Jesus, our Saviour, in that thou didst come down upon him as a dove.”

It came to pass then, when John had brought forward these words, that the First Mystery which looketh without, said unto -him: “Well said, John, beloved brother.”

## CHAPTER 64

<small>Gabriēl and Michaēl are summoned to help Pistis Sophia.</small>

The First Mystery again continued and said: "It came to pass, therefore, that the power which had come out of the Height, that is I, in that my Father sent me to save Pistis Sophia out of the chaos, \[that\] I, therefore, and also the power which did go from me, and the soul which I had received from Sabaōth, the Good,—they drew towards one another and become a single light-stream, which shone very exceedingly. I called down Gabriēl and Michaēl out of the æons, at the command of my Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, and I gave unto them the light-stream and let them go down into the chaos **(129)** to help Pistis Sophia and to take the light-powers, which the emanations of Self-willed had taken from her, from them and give them to Pistis Sophia.

“And straightway, when they had brought down the light-stream into the chaos, it shone most exceedingly in the whole of the chaos, and spread itself over all their regions. And when the emanations of Self-willed had seen the great light of that stream, they were terror-stricken one with the other. And that stream drew forth out of them all the light-powers which they had taken from Pistis Sophia, and the emanations of Self-willed could not dare to lay hold of that light-stream <span id="p109">[<sup><small>p. 109</small></sup>]</span> in the dark chaos; nor could they lay hold of it with the art of Self-willed, who ruleth over the emanations.

<small>The light-stream restoreth the light-powers to Sophia.</small>

“And Gabriēl and Michaēl led the light-stream over the body of the matter of Pistis Sophia and poured into her all the light-powers which they had taken from her. And the body of her matter became shining throughout, and all the powers also in her, whose light they had taken away, took light and ceased to lack their light, for they got their light which had been taken from them, because the light was given them through me. And Michaēl and Gabriēl, who ministered and had brought the light-stream **(130)** into the chaos, will give them the mysteries of the Light; it is they to whom the light-stream was entrusted, which I have given unto them and brought into the chaos. And Michaēl and Gabriēl have taken no light for themselves from the lights of Sophia, which they had taken from the emanations of Self-willed.

<small>The light-stream, having accomplished its purpose, departeth from Sophia.</small>

“It came to pass then, when the light-stream had ingathered into Pistis Sophia all her light-powers, which it had taken from the emanations of Self-willed, that she became shining throughout; and the light-powers also in Pistis Sophia, which the emanations of Self-willed had not taken, became joyful again and filled themselves with light. And the lights which were poured into Pistis Sophia, quickened the body of her matter, in which no light was present, and which was on the point of perishing or perished. And they raised up all her powers which were on the point of being dissolved. And they took unto themselves a light-power and became again as they <span id="p110">[<sup><small>p. 110</small></sup>]</span> were before, and they increased again in their sense of the Light. And all the light-powers of Sophia knew themselves mutually through my light-stream and were saved through the light of that stream. And my light-stream, when. it had taken away the lights from the emanations of Self-willed, which they had taken away from **(131)** Pistis Sophia, poured them into Pistis Sophia, and turned itself about and went up out of the chaos.”

When then the First Mystery said this to the disciples, that it had befallen Pistis Sophia in the chaos, he answered and said unto them: “Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?”

## CHAPTER 65

Peter came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning the solution of the words which thou hast spoken, thus hath thy light-power prophesied aforetime through Solomon in his Odes:

<small>Peter interpreteth the narrative from the Odes of Solomon.</small>

“‘1. A stream came forth and became a great wide flood.

“‘2. It tore away all to itself and turned itself against the temple.

“‘3. Dams and buildings could not hold it, nor could the art of them who hold the waters.

“‘4. It was led over the whole land and laid hold of all.

“‘5. They who were on the dry sand, drank; their thirst was quieted and quenched, when the draught from the hand of the Highest was given.

“‘6. Blessed are the ministers of that draught, to whom the water of the Lord is entrusted.

“‘7. They have refreshed parched lips; they whose power was taken away, have gotten joy of heart and they have laid hold of souls, having <span id="p111">[<sup><small>p. 111</small></sup>]</span> poured in the breath, so that they should not die.

“‘8. They have raised up limbs which were fallen; they have given power to their openness and light unto their eyes.

“‘9. For they all have known themselves in the Lord and are saved through the water of Life eternal.’

“Hearken, therefore, my Lord, that I may set forth the word in openness. As thy **(132)** power hath prophesied through Solomon: ‘A stream came forth and became a great wide flood,’—this is: The light-stream hath spread itself out in the chaos over all the regions of the emanations of Self-willed.

“And again the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: ‘It tore away all to itself and led it over the temple,’—that is: It drew all the light-powers out of the emanations of Self-willed, which they had taken from Pistis Sophia, and poured them anew into Pistis Sophia.

“And again the word thy power hath spoken: ‘The dams and buildings could not hold it,’—that is: The emanations of Self-willed could not hold the light-stream within the walls of the darkness of the chaos.

“And again the word which it hath spoken: It was led over the whole land and filled all,'—that is: When Gabriēl and Michaēl had led it over the body of Pistis Sophia, they poured into her all the lights which the emanations of Self-willed had taken from her, and the body of her matter shone.

“And the word which it hath spoken: ‘They who were in the dry sand, drank,’—that is:

<span id="p112">[<sup><small>p. 112</small></sup>]</span>

All in Pistis Sophia whose light had before been taken away, got light.

“And the word which it hath spoken: ‘Their thirst was quieted **(133)** and quenched,’—that is: Her powers ceased to lack the light, because their light, which had been taken from them, was given them \[again\].

“And again as thy power hath spoken: ‘The draught through the Highest was given them,’—that is: The light was given unto them through the light-stream, which came forth out of thee, the First Mystery.”

“And as thy power hath spoken: ‘Blessed are the ministers of that draught,’—this is the word which thou hast spoken: ‘Michaēl and Gabriēl, who have ministered, have brought the light-stream into the chaos and also led it forth again. They will give them the mysteries of the Light of the Height, they to whom the light-stream is entrusted.’

“And again as thy power hath spoken: ‘They have refreshed parched lips,’—that is: Gabriēl and Michaēl have not taken for themselves from the lights of Pistis Sophia, which they had spoiled from the emanations of Self-willed, but they have poured them into Pistis Sophia.

“And again the word which it hath spoken:

They whose power was taken away, have gotten joy of heart,'—that is: All the other powers of Pistis Sophia, which the emanations of Self-willed have not taken, are become exceedingly merry and have filled themselves with light from their light-fellows, for these have poured it into them. **(134)**

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘They have quickened souls, having poured in <span id="p113">[<sup><small>p. 113</small></sup>]</span> the breath, so that they should not die,’—that is: When they had poured the lights into Pistis Sophia, they quickened the body of her matter, from which they had before taken its lights, and which was on the point of perishing.

“And again the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘They have raised up limbs which were fallen, or that they should not fall,’—that is: When they poured into her her lights, they raised up all her powers which were on the point of being dissolved.

“And again as thy light-power hath spoken: They have received again their light and have become as they were before '; and again the word which it hath spoken: ‘They have given light unto their eyes,’—that is: They have received sense in the Light and known the light-stream, that it belongeth to the Height.

“And again the word which it hath spoken: ‘They all have known themselves in the Lord,’—that is: All the powers of Pistis Sophia have known one another through the light-stream.

“And again the word which it hath spoken: ‘They are saved through water of Life eternal,’—that is: They are saved through the whole light-stream.

“And again the word which it hath spoken: ‘The light-stream tore all to itself and drew it over the temple,’—that is: When the light-stream had taken all the light-powers of Pistis Sophia and had spoiled them from the emanations of Self-willed, it poured them into Pistis Sophia **(135)** and turned itself about and went out of the chaos and came over thee,—thou who art the temple.

“This is the solution of all the words which <span id="p114">[<sup><small>p. 114</small></sup>]</span> thy light-power hath spoken through the Ode of Solomon.”

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard Peter speak these words, that he said unto him: “Well said, blessed Peter. This is the solution of the words which have been spoken.”

## CHAPTER 66

<small>The emanations of Sell-willed cry aloud to him for help.</small>

And the First Mystery continued again in the discourse and said: "It came to pass then, before I had led forth Pistis Sophia out of the chaos, because it was not yet commanded me through my Father, the First Mystery which looketh within,—at that time then, after the emanations of Self-willed had perceived that my light-stream had taken from them the light-powers which they had taken from Pistis Sophia, and had poured them into Pistis Sophia, and when they again had seen Pistis Sophia, that she shone as she had done from the beginning, that they were enraged against Pistis Sophia and cried out again to their Self-willed, that he should come and help them, so that they might take away the powers in Pistis Sophia anew.

<small>He sendeth forth another more violent power like unto a flying arrow.</small>

<small>The fashioning of the serpent-, basilisk- and dragon-powers.</small>

“And Self-willed sent out of the height, out of the thirteenth æon, and sent another great light-power. It came down into the chaos **(136)** as a flying arrow, that he might help his emanations, so that they might take away the lights from Pistis Sophia anew. And when that light-power had come down, the emanations of Self-willed which were in the chaos and oppressed Pistis Sophia, took great courage and again pursued Pistis Sophia with great terror and great alarm. And some of the emanations of Self-willed oppressed her. One of them changed itself into <span id="p115">[<sup><small>p. 115</small></sup>]</span> the form of a great serpent; another again changed itself also into the form of a seven-headed basilisk; another again changed itself into the form of a dragon. And moreover the first power of Self-willed, the lion-faced, and all his other very numerous emanations, they came together and oppressed Pistis Sophia and led her again into the lower regions of the chaos and alarmed her again exceedingly.

The demon-power of Adamas dasheth Sophia down."It came to pass then that there looked down out of the twelve æons, Adamas, the Tyrant, who also was wroth with Pistis Sophia, because she desired to go to the Light of lights, which was above them all; therefore was he wroth with her. It came to pass then, when Adamas, the Tyrant, had looked down out of the twelve æons, that he saw the emanations of Self-willed oppressing Pistis Sophia, until they should take from her all her lights. It came to pass then, when the power of Adamas had come down into the chaos unto all the emanations of Self-willed,—it came to pass then, when that demon came down into the chaos, that it dashed down Pistis Sophia. And the lion-faced power and the serpent-form and the basilisk-form and the dragon-form and all the other very numerous emanations of Self-willed surrounded Pistis Sophia all together, desiring to take from her anew her powers in her, and they oppressed Pistis Sophia exceedingly and threatened her. It came to pass then, when they oppressed her and alarmed her exceedingly, that she cried again to the Light and sang praises, saying:

“‘1. O Light, it is thou who hast helped me; let thy light come over me.

<span id="p116">[<sup><small>p. 116</small></sup>]</span>

<small>Sophia again crieth to the Light.</small>

“‘2. For thou art my protector, and I come hence unto thee, O Light, having faith in thee, O Light.

“‘3. For thou art my saviour from the emanations of Self-willed and of Adamas, the Tyrant, and thou shalt save me from all his violent threats.’

<small>Gabriēl and Michaēl and the light-stream again go to her aid.</small>

“And when Pistis Sophia had said this, then at the commandment **(138)** of my Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, I sent again Gabriēl and Michaēl and the great light-stream, that they should help Pistis Sophia. And I gave commandment unto Gabriēl and Michaēl to bear Pistis Sophia in their hands, so that her feet should not touch the darkness below; and I gave them commandment moreover to guide her in the regions of the chaos, out of which she was to be led.

“It came to pass then, when the angels had come down into the chaos, they and the light-stream, and moreover \[when\] all the emanations of Self-willed and the emanations of Adamas had seen the light-stream, how it shone very exceedingly and there was no measure for the light about it, that they became terror-stricken and quitted Pistis Sophia. And the great light-stream surrounded Pistis Sophia on all sides of her, on her left and on her right and on all her sides, and it became a light-wreath round her head.

“It came to pass then, when the light-stream had surrounded Pistis Sophia, that she took great courage, and it ceased not to surround her on all her sides; and she was no longer in fear of the emanations of Self-willed which are in the <span id="p117">[<sup><small>p. 117</small></sup>]</span> chaos, nor was she any more in fear of the other new power of Self-willed which he had cast down into the chaos **(139)** as a flying arrow, nor did she any more tremble at the demon power of Adamas which had come out of the æons.

<small>The transfiguration of Sophia.</small>

“And moreover by commandment of myself, the First Mystery which looketh without, the light-stream which surrounded Pistis Sophia on all her sides, shone most exceedingly, and Pistis Sophia abode in the midst of the light, a great light being on her left and on her right, and on all her sides, forming a wreath round her head. And all the emanations of Self-willed \[could\] not change their face again, nor could they bear the shock of the great light of the stream, which was a wreath round her head. And all the emanations of Self-willed,—many of them fell at her right, because she shone most exceedingly, and many others fell at her left, and were not able at all to draw nigh unto Pistis Sophia because of the great light; but they fell all one on another, or they all came near one another, and they could not inflict any ill on Pistis Sophia, because she had trusted in the Light.

<small>Jesus, the First Mystery looking without, causeth Sophia to triumph.</small>

“And at the commandment of my Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, I myself went down into the chaos, shining most exceedingly, and approached the lion-faced power, which shone exceedingly, and took its whole light in it and held fast all the emanations of Self-willed, so that from now on they went not into their region, that is the thirteenth æon. And I took away the power of all the emanations of Self-willed, and they all fell down in the chaos powerless. And I led forth Pistis Sophia, she <span id="p118">[<sup><small>p. 118</small></sup>]</span> being on the right of Gabriēl and Michaēl. And the great light-stream entered again into her. And Pistis Sophia beheld with her eyes her foes, that I had taken their light-power from them. And I led Pistis Sophia forth from the chaos, she treading under foot the serpent-faced emanation of Self-willed, and moreover treading under foot the seven-faced-basilisk emanation, and treading under foot the lion- and dragon-faced power. I made Pistis Sophia continue to stand upon the seven-headed-basilisk emanation of Self-willed; and it was more mighty than them all in its evil doings. And I, the First Mystery, stood by it and took all the powers in it, and made to perish its whole matter, so that no seed should arise from it from now on.”**(141)**

## CHAPTER 67

And when the First Mystery said this unto his disciples, he answered and said: “Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?”

James came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning then the solution of the words which thou hast said, thus hath thy light-power prophesied thereon aforetime through David in the ninetieth Psalm:

<small>James interpreteth the narrative from Psalm xc.</small>

“‘1. Whoso then dwelleth under the help of the Most High, will abide under the shadow of the God of heaven.

“‘2. He will say unto the Lord: Thou art my succour and my place of refuge, my God, in whom I trust.

“‘3. For he will save me out of the snare of the hunters and from mighty word.

“‘4. He will shade thee with his breast, and thou shalt have trust beneath his wings; his truth shall surround thee as a shield.

<span id="p119">[<sup><small>p. 119</small></sup>]</span>

“‘5. Thou wilt not be afraid of terror by night nor of an arrow which flieth by day,

“‘6. Of a thing which slinketh in the darkness, of a mischance and a demon at mid-day.

“‘7. A thousand will fall on **(142)** thy left, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but they shall not come nigh thee.

“‘8. Nay rather with thine eyes wilt thou behold, thou wilt see the requital of the sinners.

“‘9. For thou, O Lord, art my hope. Thou hast established the Most High for thyself as refuge.

“‘10. Harm will not come nigh unto thee; scourge will not come nigh thy dwelling.

“‘11. For he will give commandment to his angels on thy behalf that they guard thee on all thy ways,

“‘12. And bear thee on their hands, that thou mayest never strike with thy foot against a stone.

“‘13. Thou wilt stride over the serpent and basilisk and tread on lion and dragon.

“‘14. Because he hath trusted in me, I will save him; I will overshadow him, because he hath known my name.

“‘15. He will cry unto me and I shall hearken unto him; I am at his side in his tribulation and will save him and honour him,

“‘16. And increase him with many days and show him my salvation.’

“This, my Lord, is the solution of the words which thou hast said. Hearken therefore, that I may say it in openness.

“The word then which thy power hath spoken through David: ‘Whoso then dwelleth under <span id="p120">[<sup><small>p. 120</small></sup>]</span> the help of the Most High, will abide under the shadow of the God of heaven,’—that is: When Sophia had trusted in the Light, she abode under the light of the light-stream, which through thee came out of the Height.

“And the word which thy power hath spoken through David: ‘I will say unto the Lord: Thou art my succour and my refuge, my God, in whom I trust,’—it is the word with which Pistis Sophia hath sung praises: **(143)** ‘Thou art my succour, and I come unto thee.’

“And again the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘My God, in whom I trust, thou wilt save me out of the snare of the hunters and from mighty word,’—it is what Pistis Sophia hath said: ‘O Light, I have faith in thee, for thou wilt save me from the emanations of Self-willed and from those of Adamas, the Tyrant, and thou wilt save me also from all their mighty threats.’

“And again the word which thy power hath spoken through David: ‘He will shade thee with his breast, and thou wilt have trust beneath his wings,’—that is: Pistis Sophia hath been in the light of the light-stream, which hath come from thee, and hath continued in firm trust in the light, that on her left and that on her right, which are the wings of the light-stream.

“And the word which thy light-power hath prophesied through David: ‘Truth will surround thee as a shield,’—it is the light of the light-stream which hath surrounded Pistis Sophia on all her sides as a shield.

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘He will not be afraid of terror by night,’—that is: Pistis Sophia hath not been afraid of the <span id="p121">[<sup><small>p. 121</small></sup>]</span> terrors and alarms into which she had been planted in the chaos, which is the ‘night.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: **(144)** He will not be afraid of an arrow which flieth by day,'—that is: Pistis Sophia hath not been afraid of the power which Self-willed hath sent last of all out of the height, and which hath come into the chaos as it were a flying arrow. Thy light-power therefore hath said: ‘Thou wilt not be afraid of an arrow which flieth by day,’ for that power hath come out of the thirteenth æon, it being that which is lord over the twelve æons, and which giveth light unto all the æons; wherefor hath he \[David\] said ‘day.’

“And again the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘He will not be afraid of a thing which slinketh in the darkness,’—that is: Sophia hath not been afraid of the lion-faced emanation, which caused fear for Pistis Sophia in the chaos, which is the ‘darkness.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘He will not be afraid of a mischance and of a demon at mid-day,’—that is: Pistis Sophia hath not been afraid of the demon emanation of Tyrant Adamas, which hath cast Pistis Sophia to the ground in a great mischance, and which hath come forth out of Adamas out of the twelfth æon; wherefor then hath thy power said: ‘He will not be afraid of **(145)** the demon mischance at mid-day,’—‘mid-day,’ because it hath come out of the twelve æons, which is ‘mid-day’; and again \[‘night,’ because\] it hath come out of the chaos, which is the ‘night,’ and because it hath come out of the twelfth æon which is in the midst between both; therefore hath thy light-power said ‘mid-day,’ <span id="p122">[<sup><small>p. 122</small></sup>]</span> because the twelve æons lie in the midst between the thirteenth æon and the chaos.

“And again the word which thy light-power hath spoken through David: ‘A thousand will fall on his left, and ten thousand at his right hand, but they shall not come nigh him,’—that is: When the emanations of Self-willed, which are exceedingly numerous, could not bear the great light of the light-stream, many of them fell on the left hand of Pistis Sophia and many at her right, and they could not come nigh her, to do her \[harm\].

“And the word which thy light-power hath spoken through David: ‘Nay rather with thine eyes wilt thou behold, and wilt see the requital of the sinners, for thou, O Lord, art my hope,’—that is the word: Pistis Sophia hath with her eyes beheld her foes, that is the emanations of Self-willed, who all **(146)** have fallen one on another; not only hath she with her eyes beheld this, but thou also thyself, my Lord, the First Mystery, hast taken the light-power which is in the lion-faced power, and hast moreover taken the power of all the emanations of Self-willed and moreover thou hast imprisoned them in that chaos, \[so that\] from henceforth they have not gone forth to their own region. Therefore then hath Pistis Sophia with her eyes beheld her foes, that is the emanations of Self-willed, in all which David hath prophesied concerning Pistis Sophia, saying: ‘Nay rather with thine eyes wilt thou behold, and thou wilt see the requital of the sinners.’ Not only hath she with her eyes beheld, how they fall one on another in the chaos, but she hath also seen the requital with which it was requited them. Just as the emanations of Self-willed have thought <span id="p123">[<sup><small>p. 123</small></sup>]</span> to take away the light of Sophia from her, so hast thou requited them and repaid them in full, and hast taken the light-power in them instead of the lights of Sophia, who hath had faith in the Light of the Height.

“And as thy light-power hath spoken through David: ‘Thou hast established the Most High for thyself as refuge; harm will not come nigh unto thee, scourge will not come nigh thy dwelling,’—that is: When Pistis Sophia had had faith in the Light and was afflicted, she sang praises unto it, and the emanations of Self-willed could not inflict on her any harm, **(147)** nor could they \[injure\] her, nor could they at all come nigh her.

“And the word which thy light-power hath spoken through David: ‘He will give commandment to his angels on thy behalf, that they guard thee on all thy ways and bear thee on their hands, that thou mayest never strike with thy foot against a stone,’—it is again thy word: Thou hast given commandment to Gabriēl and Michaēl, that they guide Pistis Sophia in all the regions of the chaos, until they lead her forth and that they uplift her on their hands, so that her feet do not touch the darkness beneath, and \[that\] on the other hand they of the lower darkness do not seize hold of her.

“And the word which thy light-power hath spoken through David: ‘Thou wilt tread on serpent and basilisk and tread on lion and dragon; because he hath trusted in me, I will save him and I will overshadow him, because he hath known my name,’—that is the word: When Pistis Sophia was on the point of coming forth out of the chaos, she trod on the emanations of Self-willed, and she <span id="p124">[<sup><small>p. 124</small></sup>]</span> trod on the serpent-faced ones and on the basilisk-faced ones, which have seven heads; and she trod on the lion-faced power and on the dragon-faced one. Because she had had faith in the Light, is she saved from all of them.

“This, my Lord, is the solution of the words which thou hast spoken.”

## CHAPTER 68

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard these words, that he said: “Well said, James, **(148)** beloved one.”

And the First Mystery continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass, when I had led Pistis Sophia out of the chaos, that she cried out again and said:

<small>Sophia singeth a song of praise.</small>

“‘1. I am saved out of the chaos and loosed from the bonds of the darkness. I am come unto thee, O Light.

“‘2. For thou wert light on all sides of me, saving me and helping me.

“‘3. And the emanations of Self-willed, which fought against me, thou hast hindered through thy light, and they could not come nigh me; for thy light was with me and saved me through thy light-stream.

“‘4. Because in sooth the emanations of Self-willed constrained me, they took from me my power and cast me out into the chaos with no light in me. So I became as heavy-weighing matter in comparison with them.

“‘5. And thereafter came a light-stream unto me through thee which saved me; it shone on my left and on my right and surrounded me on all sides of me, so that no part of me was without light.

“‘6. And thou hast covered me with the light <span id="p125">[<sup><small>p. 125</small></sup>]</span> of thy stream and purged from me all my evil matters; and I shall be relieved of all my matters because of thy light.

“‘7. And it is thy light-stream which hath raised me up and taken from me the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me.

“‘8. And I **(149)** have become sure-trusting in thy light and purified light in thy stream.

“‘9. And the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me, have withdrawn themselves from me; and I shone in thy great power, for thou savest for ever.’

“This is the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she came forth out of the chaos and was freed from the bonds of the chaos. Now, therefore, who hath ears to hear, let him hear.”

## CHAPTER 69

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that Thomas came forward, and said: “My Lord, my light-dweller hath ears and my mind hath understood the words which thou hast said. Now, therefore, give commandment unto me to set forth clearly the solution of the words.”

And the First Mystery answered and said unto Thomas: “I give thee commandment to set forth the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia sang unto me.”

<small>Thomas interpreteth the song of Sophia from the Odes of Solomon.</small>

Thomas answered and said: "My Lord, concerning the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, because she was saved out of the chaos, thy light-power prophesied aforetime thereon through Solomon, the son of David, in his Odes:

“‘1. I am saved **(150)** from the bonds and am fled unto thee, O Lord.

<span id="p126">[<sup><small>p. 126</small></sup>]</span>

“‘2. For thou hast been on my right hand, saving me and helping me.

“‘3. Thou hast hindered my adversaries and they have not been revealed, because thy face was with me, saving me in thy grace.

“‘4. I was despised in the sight of many and cast out; I have become as lead in their sight.

“‘5. Through thee I have gotten a power which helped me; for thou hast set lamps on my right and on my left, so that no side of me may be without light.

“‘6. Thou hast overshadowed me with the shadow of thy grace, and I was relieved of the coats of skin.

“‘7. It is thy right hand which hath raised me up, and thon hast taken the sickness from me.

“‘8. I have become powerful in thy truth and purified in thy righteousness.

“‘9. My adversaries have withdrawn themselves from me, and I am justified by thy goodness, for thy rest endureth unto all eternity.’

“This then, my Lord, is the solution of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she was saved out of the chaos. Hearken, therefore, that I may say it in openness.

“The word then which thy light-power hath spoken through Solomon: ‘I am saved from the bonds and am fled unto thee, O Lord,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘I am loosed from the bonds of the darkness and am come unto thee, O Light.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘Thou wert on my right hand, saving **(151)** and helping me,’—it is again the word which Pistis Sophia <span id="p127">[<sup><small>p. 127</small></sup>]</span> hath spoken: ‘Thou art become a light on all sides of me, \[saving me\] and helping me.’

“And the word which thy light-power hath spoken: ‘Thou hast hindered my adversaries and they have not been revealed,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And the emanations of Self-willed which fought against me, thou hast hindered through thy light, and they could not come nigh me.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘Thy face was with me, saving me in thy grace,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘Thy light was with me, saving me in thy light-stream.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘I was despised in the sight of many and cast out,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken:

The emanations of Self-willed constrained me and took my power from me, and I have been despised before them and cast out into the chaos, with no light in me.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken:

I have become as lead in their sight,'—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘When they had taken my light from me, I became as heavy-weighing matter before them.’

“And moreover the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘Through thee **(152)** I have gotten a power for me which helped me,’—it is again the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And thereafter came a light-power unto me through thee which saved me.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘Thou hast set lamps on my right and on my left, so that no side of me may be without light,’—it <span id="p128">[<sup><small>p. 128</small></sup>]</span> is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken:

‘Thy power shone on my right and on my left and surrounded me on all sides of me, so that no part of me was without light.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken:

‘Thou hast overshadowed me with the shadow of thy grace,’—it is again the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And thou hast covered me with the light of the stream.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: I was relieved of the coats of skin,'—it is again the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And they have purified me of all my evil matters, and I raised myself above them in thy light.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: ‘It is thy right hand which hath raised me up, and hath taken the sickness from me,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And it is thy light-stream which hath raised me up in thy light and hath taken from me the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me.’ **(153)**

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘I have become powerful in thy truth and purified in thy righteousness,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘I have become powerful in thy light and purified light in thy stream.’

And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘My adversaries have withdrawn themselves from me,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘The emanations of Self-willed which constrained me, have withdrawn themselves from me.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: ‘And I am justified in thy <span id="p129">[<sup><small>p. 129</small></sup>]</span> goodness, for thy rest endureth unto all eternity,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘I am saved in thy goodness; for thou savest every one.’

“This then, O my Lord, is the whole solution of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she was saved out of the chaos and loosed from the bonds of the darkness.”

## CHAPTER 70

It came to pass then when the First Mystery had heard Thomas say these words, that he said unto him: “Well said, finely, Thomas, blessed one. This is the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.”

And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples: "And Pistis Sophia continued and sang praises unto me, saying:

<small>Sophia singeth another song of praise.</small>

“‘1. I sing a song unto thee; **(154)** through thy commandment hast thou led me down out of the higher æon which is above, and hast led me up to the regions which are below.

“‘2. And again through thy commandment thou hast saved me out of the regions which are below, and through thee hast thou taken there the matter in my light-powers, and I have seen it.

“‘3. And thou hast scattered far from me the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me and were hostile to me, and hast bestowed power on me to loose myself from the bonds of the emanations of Adamas.

“‘4. And thou hast smitten the basilisk with the seven heads and cast it out with my hands and hast set me above its matter. Thou hast destroyed it, so that its seed may not raise itself up from now on.

“‘5. And thou Wert with me, giving me power <span id="p130">[<sup><small>p. 130</small></sup>]</span> in all this, and thy light surrounded me in all regions, and through thee hast thou made all the emanations of Self-willed powerless.

“‘6. For thou hast taken the power of their light from them and made straight my way to lead me out of the chaos.

“‘7. And thou hast removed me from the material darknesses and taken from them all my powers, from which the light had been taken.

“‘8. Thou hast put into them purified light and unto all my limbs, **(155)** in which was no light, thou hast given purified light from the Light of the Height.

“‘9. And thou hast made straight the way for them \[_sc._ my limbs\], and the light of thy face hath become for me life indestructible.

“‘10. Thou hast led me forth above the chaos, the region of chaos and extermination, in order that all the matters in it which are in that region, might be unloosed and all my powers be renewed in thy light, and thy light be in them all.

“‘11. Thou hast deposited the light of thy stream in me and I am become purified light.’

“This again is the second song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered. Who then hath understood this repentance, let him come forward and speak it.”
