## CHAPTER 11

<small>Jesus putteth on his vesture.</small>

“It came to pass then, when I saw the mystery of all these words in the vesture which was sent me, that straightway I clothed myself therewith, and I shone most exceedingly and soared into the height.

<small>He entereth the firmament.</small>

“I came before the \[first\] gate of the firmament, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was about me, and the gates of the firmament were shaken one over against another and all opened at once.

<small>The powers of the firmament are amazed and fall down and adore him.</small>

“And all rulers and all authorities and all angels therein were thrown all together into agitation because of the great light which was on me. And they gazed at the radiant vesture of <span id="p16"><sup><small>[ p. 16 ]</small></sup></span> light with which I was clad, and they saw the mystery which contains their names, **(21)** and they feared most exceedingly. And all their bonds with which they were bound, were unloosed and every one left his order, and they all fell down before me, adored and said: ‘How hath the lord of the universe passed through us without our knowing?’ And they all sang praises together to the interiors of the interiors; but me they saw not, but they saw only the light. And they were in great fear and were exceedingly agitated and sang praises to the interiors of the interiors.

## CHAPTER 12

<small>He entereth the first sphere.</small>

“And I left that region behind me and ascended to the first sphere, shining most exceedingly, forty-and-nine-times more brightly than I had shone in the firmament. It came to pass then, when I had reached the gate of the first sphere, that its gates were shaken and opened of themselves at once.

<small>The powers of the first sphere are amazed and fall down and adore him.</small>

“I entered into the houses of the sphere, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure to the light that was about me. And all the rulers and all those who are in that sphere, fell into agitation one against another. And they saw the great light that was about me, and they gazed upon my vesture and saw thereon the mystery of their name. And they fell into still greater agitation, and were in great fear, saying: ‘How hath the lord of the universe passed through us without our knowing?’ **(22)** And all their bonds were unloosed and their regions and their orders; and every one left his order, and they fell down all together, adored before me, or before my vesture, and all sang <span id="p17"><sup><small>[ p. 17 ]</small></sup></span> praises together to the interiors of the interiors, being in great fear and great agitation.

## CHAPTER 13

<small>He entereth the second sphere.</small>

“And I left that region behind me and came to the gate of the second sphere, which is the Fate. Then were all its gates thrown into agitation and opened of themselves. And I entered into the houses of the Fate, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light that was about me, for I shone in the Fate forty-and-nine times more than in the \[first\] sphere.

<small>The powers of the second sphere are amazed and fall down and adore him.</small>

“And all the rulers and all those who are in the Fate, were thrown into agitation and fell on one another and were in exceeding great fear on seeing the great light that was about me. And they gazed on my vesture of light and saw the mystery of their name on my vesture and fell into still greater agitation; and they were in great fear, saying: ‘How hath the lord of the universe passed through us without our knowing?’ And all the bonds of their regions and of their orders and of their houses were unloosed; they all came at once, fell down, adored before me and sang praises all together **(23)** to the interiors of the interiors, being in great fear and great agitation.

## CHAPTER 14

<small>He entereth the æons.</small>

“And I left that region behind me and ascended to the great æons of the rulers and came before their veils and their gates, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was about me. It came to pass then, when I arrived at the twelve æons, that their veils and their gates were shaken one over against the other. Their veils drew themselves apart of their own accord, and their gates opened one <span id="p18"><sup><small>[ p. 18 ]</small></sup></span> over against the other. And I entered into the æons, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light that was about me, forty-and-nine times more than the light with which I shone in the houses of the Fate.

<small>The powers of the æons are amazed and fall down and adore him.</small>

“And all the angels of the æons and their archangels and their rulers and their gods and their lords and their authorities and their tyrants and their powers and their light-sparks and their light-givers and their unpaired and their invisibles and their forefathers and their triple-powers saw me, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was about me. And they were thrown into agitation the one over against the other and great fear fell upon them, when they saw the great light that was about me. And in their great agitation and their great fear they withdrew as far as **(24)** the region of the great invisible Forefather, and of the three great triple-powers. And because of the great fear of their agitation, the great Forefather, he and the three triple-powers, kept on running hither and thither in his region, and they could not close all their regions because of the great fear in which they were. And they agitated all their æons together and all their spheres and all their orders, fearing and being greatly agitated because of the great light which was about me—not of the former quality that it was about me when I was on the earth of man-kind, when the light-vesture came over me,—for the world could not bear the light such as it was in its truth, else would the world at once be destroyed and all upon it,—but the light which was about me in the twelve æons was <span id="p19"><sup><small>[ p. 19 ]</small></sup></span> eight-thousand-and-seven-hundred-myriad times greater than that which was about me in the world among you.

## CHAPTER 15

<small>Adamas and the tyrants fight against the light.</small>

“It came to pass then, when all those who are in the twelve æons saw the great light which was about me, that they were all thrown into agitation one over against the other, and ran hither and thither in the æons. And all æons and all heavens and their whole ordering were agitated one over against the other on **(25)** account of the great fear which was on them, for they knew not the mystery which had taken place. And Adamas, the great Tyrant, and all the tyrants in all the æons began to fight in vain against the light, and they knew not against whom they fought, because they saw nothing but the overmastering light.

“It came to pass then, when they fought against the light, that they were weakened all together one with another, were dashed down in the æons and became as the inhabitants of the earth, dead and without breath of life.

<small>He taketh from them a third of their power.</small>

“And I took from all a third of their power, that they should no more be active in their evil doings, and that, if the men who are in the world, invoke them in their mysteries—those which the angels who transgressed have brought down, that is their sorceries,—in order that, therefore, if they invoke them in their evil doings, they may not be able to accomplish them.

<small>He changeth the motion of their spheres.</small>

“And the Fate and the sphere over which they rule, I have changed and brought it to pass that they spend six months turned to the left and accomplish their influences, and that six months they face to the right and accomplish <span id="p20"><sup><small>[ p. 20 ]</small></sup></span> their influences. For by command of the First Commandment and by command of the First Mystery **(26)** Yew, the Overseer of the Light, had set them facing the left at every time and accomplishing their influences and their deeds.

## CHAPTER 16

“It came to pass then, when I came into their region, that they mutinied and fought against the light. And I took the third of their power, in order that they should not be able to accomplish their evil deeds. And the Fate and the sphere, over which they rule, I have changed, and set them facing the left six months and accomplishing their influences, and I have set them turned another six months to the right and accomplishing their influences.”

## CHAPTER 17

When then he had said this to his disciples, he said unto them: “Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.”

It came to pass then, when Mary had heard the Saviour say these words, that she gazed fixedly into the air for the space of an hour. She said: “My Lord, give commandment unto me to speak in openness.”

<small>Mary Magdalene asketh and receiveth permission to speak.</small>

And Jesus, the compassionate, answered and said unto Mary: “Mary, thou blessed one, whom I will perfect in all mysteries of those of the height, discourse in openness, thou, whose heart is raised to the kingdom of heaven more than all thy brethren.”

## CHAPTER 18

Then said Mary to the Saviour: "My Lord, the word which thou hast spoken unto us: ‘Who **(27)** hath ears to hear, let him hear,’ thou sayest in order that we may understand the word which thou hast spoken. Hearken, therefore, my Lord, that I may discourse in openness.

<span id="p21"><sup><small>[ p. 21 ]</small></sup></span>

<small>Mary interpreteth the discourse from the words of Isaiah.</small>

“The word which thou hast spoken: ‘I have taken a third from the power of the rulers of all the æons, and changed their Fate and their sphere over which they rule, in order that, if the race of men invoke them in the mysteries—those which the angels who transgressed have taught them for the accomplishing of their evil and lawless deeds in the mystery of their sorcery,’—in order then that they may no more from this hour accomplish their lawless deeds, because thou hast taken their power from them and from their horoscope-casters and their consulters and from those who declare to the men in the world all things which shall come to pass, in order that they should no more from this hour know how to declare unto them any thing at all which will come to pass (for thou hast changed their spheres, and hast made them spend six months turned to the left and accomplishing their influences, and another six months facing the right and accomplishing their influences),—concerning this word then, my Lord, the power which was in the prophet Isaiah, hath spoken thus and proclaimed aforetime in a spiritual similitude, discoursing on the ‘Vision about Egypt’: ‘Where then, O Egypt, where are thy consulters and horoscope-casters and those who cry **(28)** out of the earth and those who cry out of their belly? Let them then declare unto thee from now on the deeds which the lord Sabaōth will do!’

“The power then which was in the prophet Isaiah, prophesied before thou didst come, that thou wouldst take away the power of the rulers of the æons and wouldst change their sphere and their Fate, in order that they might <span id="p22"><sup><small>[ p. 22 ]</small></sup></span> know nothing from now on. For this cause it hath said also: ‘Ye shall then know not of what the lord Sabaōth will do ’; that is, none of the rulers will know what thou wilt do from now on,—for they are ‘Egypt,’ because they are matter. The power then which was in Isaiah, prophesied concerning thee aforetime, saying: ‘From now on ye shall then know not what the lord Sabaōth will do.’ Because of the light-power which thou didst receive from Sabaōth, the Good, who is in the region of the Right, and which is in thy material body to-day, for this cause then, my Lord Jesus, thou hast said unto us: ‘Who hath ears to hear, let him hear,’—in order that thou mightest know whose heart is ardently raised to the kingdom of heaven.”


## CHAPTER 19

It came to pass then, when Mary had finished saying these words, that he said: “Well said, Mary, for thou art blessed before all women on the earth, **(29)** because thou shalt be the fulness of all fulnesses and the perfection of all perfections.”

<small>Jesus commendeth Mary. She further questioneth him on the changing of the spheres.</small>

Now when Mary had heard the Saviour speak these words, she exulted greatly, and she came before Jesus, fell down before him, adored his feet and said unto him: “My Lord, hearken unto me, that I may question thee on this word, before that thou discoursest with us about the regions whither thou didst go.”

Jesus answered and said unto Mary: “Discourse in openness and fear not; all things on which thou questionest, I will reveal unto thee.”

## CHAPTER 20

She said: “My Lord, will all the men who know the mystery of the magic of all the rulers of all the æons of the Fate and of those of the sphere, in the way in which the angels who transgressed <span id="p23"><sup><small>[ p. 23 ]</small></sup></span> have taught them, if they invoke them in their mysteries, that is in their evil magic, to the hindering of good deeds,—will they accomplish them henceforth from now on or not?”

<small>Jesus explaineth further the conversion of the spheres.</small>

Jesus answered and said unto Mary: “They will not accomplish them as they accomplished them from the beginning, because I have taken away a third of their power; but they will raise a loan from those who know the mysteries of the magic of the thirteenth æon. And if they invoke the mysteries of the magic of those who are in the thirteenth æon, **(30)** they will accomplish them well and surely, because I have not taken away power from that region, according to the command of the First Mystery.”
