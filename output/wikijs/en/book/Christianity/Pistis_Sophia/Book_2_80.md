## CHAPTER 71

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words, that Matthew came forward and said: “I have understood the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered. Now, therefore, give commandment unto me, that I speak it in openness.”

And the First Mystery answered and said: “I give commandment unto thee, Matthew, to <span id="p131"><sup><small>[ p. 131 ]</small></sup></span> set forth the interpretation of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.”

And Matthew answered and said: "Concerning the interpretation of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, thus thy light-power prophesied aforetime thereon through the Ode of Solomon:

<small>Matthew interpreteth the song of Sophia from the Odes of Solomon.</small>

“‘1. He who hath led me down out of the higher regions which are above, hath led me up out of **(156)** the regions which are in the bottom below.

“‘2. Who hath there taken those in the midst, he hath taught me concerning them.

“‘3. Who hath scattered my foes and my adversaries, he hath bestowed power on me over the bonds, to unloose them.

“‘4. Who hath smitten the serpent with the seven heads with my hands, he hath set me up above its root, that I may extinguish its seed.

“‘5. And thou wert with me, helping me; in all regions thy name surrounded me.

“‘6. Thy right hand hath destroyed the venom of the slanderer; thy hand hath cleared the way for thy faithful.

“‘7. Thou hast freed them out of the tombs and hast removed them from the midst of the corpses.

“‘8. Thou hast taken dead bones and hast clothed them with a body and to them who stirred not, hast thou given the activity of life.

“‘9. Thy way is become indestructibleness and thy face \[also\].

“‘10. Thou hast led thy æon above decay, so that they all may be loosed and renewed and thy light become a foundation for them all.

“‘11. Thou hast piled thy riches upon them and they have become a holy dwelling-place.’

<span id="p132"><sup><small>[ p. 132 ]</small></sup></span>

“This then, my Lord, is the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered. Hearken, therefore, that I may say it in openness.

“The word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: ‘Who hath led me down out of the higher regions which are above, he hath also led me up out of the regions which are in the bottom below,’—it is the **(157)** word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘I sing praises unto thee; through thy commandment hast thou led me down out of this higher æon which is above, and hast led me to the regions below. And again through thy commandment thou hast saved me and led me up out of the regions which are below.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: ‘Who hath there taken those in the midst and hath taught me concerning them,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophis hath spoken: ‘And again through thy commandment hast thou caused the matter in the midst of my power to be purified, and I have seen it.’

“And moreover the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon: ‘Who hath scattered my foes and my adversaries,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘Thou hast scattered far from me all the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me and were hostile to me.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘Who hath bestowed on me wisdom over the bonds, to unloose them,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And he hath bestowed on me wisdom to loose myself from the bonds of those emanations.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: Who hath smitten **(158)** the serpent with the seven <span id="p133"><sup><small>[ p. 133 ]</small></sup></span> heads with my hands, he hath set me up above its root, that I may extinguish its seed,'—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And thou hast smitten the serpent with the seven heads through my hands and set me up above its matter. Thou hast destroyed it, so that its seed may not raise itself up from now on.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘And thou wert with me, helping me,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And thou wert with me, giving me power in all this.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘And thy name surrounded me in all regions,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And thy light surrounded me in all their regions.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘And thy right hand hath destroyed the venom of the slanderers,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And through thee the emanations of Self-willed became powerless, for thou hast taken from them the light of their power.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken:

Thy hand hath cleared the way for thy faithful,'—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘Thou hast made straight my way to lead the out of the chaos, because I have had faith in thee.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘Thou hast freed them out of the tombs and hast removed them from the midst of the corpses,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘Thou hast freed me out of the chaos and removed me out of the material darknesses, that is **(159)** out of the dark emanations which are in the chaos, from which thou hast taken their light.’

<span id="p134"><sup><small>[ p. 134 ]</small></sup></span>

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘Thou hast taken dead bones and hast clothed them with a body, and to them who stirred not, thou hast given activity of life,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And thou hast taken all my powers in which was no light, and hast bestowed on them within purified light, and unto all my limbs, in which no light stirred, thou hast given life-light out of thy Height.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken:

Thy way is become indestructibleness, and thy face \[also\],'—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And thou hast made straight thy way for me, and the light of thy face hath become for me life indestructible.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘Thou hast led thy æon above decay, so that all might be loosed and renewed,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘Thou hast led me, thy power, up above the chaos and above decay, that all the matters in that region may be loosed and all my powers renewed in the Light.’

“And the word which thy power hath spoken: ‘And thy light hath \[become\] foundation for them all,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘And thy light hath been in them all.’ **(160)**

“And the word which thy light-power hath spoken through Solomon: ‘Thou hast put thy riches over him, and he hath become a holy dwelling-place,’—it is the word which Pistis Sophia hath spoken: ‘Thou hast stayed the light of thy stream over me, and I have become a purified light.’

“This then, my Lord, is the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.”

## CHAPTER 72

<span id="p135"><sup><small>[ p. 135 ]</small></sup></span>

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard Matthew speak these words, that he said: “Well said, Matthew, and finely, beloved. This is the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.”

And the First Mystery continued again and said:

<small>Sophia continueth to sing.</small>

“‘1. I will declare: Thou art the higher Light, for that hast saved me and led me unto thee, and thou hast not let the emanations of Self-willed, which are hostile unto me, take my light.

“‘2. O Light of lights, I sing praises unto thee; thou hast saved me.

“‘3. O Light, thou hast led up my power out of the chaos; thou hast saved me from them which have gone down into the darkness.’

“These words again hath Pistis Sophia uttered, Now, therefore, whose mind hath become understanding, comprehending the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, let him come forward and set forth their solution.”

<small>Mary is afraid of Peter.</small>

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished speaking these words unto the disciples, that Mary came forward and said: “My Lord, my **(161)** mind is ever understanding, at every time to come forward and set forth the solution of the words which she hath uttered; but I am afraid of Peter, because he threatened me and hateth our sex.”

And when she had said this, the First Mystery said unto her: “Every one who shall be filled with the spirit of light to come forward and set forth the solution of what I say,—no one shall be able to prevent him. Now, therefore, O Mary, set forth then the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.”

<span id="p136"><sup><small>[ p. 136 ]</small></sup></span>

Then Mary answered and said unto the First Mystery in the midst of the disciples: "My Lord, concerning the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, thus hath thy light-power prophesied aforetime through David:

<small>Mary interpreteth the song of Sophia from Psalm xxix.</small>

“‘1. I will exalt thee, O Lord, for thou hast received me, and thou hast not made glad my foes over me.

“‘2. O Lord, my God, I cried up unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

“‘3. O Lord, thou hast led up my soul out of hell; thou hast saved me from them which have gone down into the pit.’”

## CHAPTER 73

And when Mary had said this, the First Mystery said unto her, “Well said, finely, Mary, blessed one.”

And he continued **(162)** again in the discourse and said unto the disciples: "Sophia again continued in this song and said:

<small>Sophia continueth her song.</small>

“‘1. The Light hath become my saviour.

“‘2. And it hath changed my darkness into light, and it has rent the chaos which surrounded me and girded me with light.’”

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words, that Martha came forward and said: "My Lord, thy power hath prophesied aforetime through David concerning these words:

<small>Martha interpreteth from Psalm xxix.</small>

“‘10. The Lord hath become my helper.

“‘11. He hath changed my lamentation into joy; he hath rent my mourning-robe and girded me with joy.’”

And it came to pass when the First Mystery had heard Martha speak these words, that he said: “Well said, and finely, Martha.”

<span id="p137"><sup><small>[ p. 137 ]</small></sup></span>

And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples: "Pistis Sophia again continued in the song and said:

<small>Sophia continueth her song.</small>

“‘1. My power, sing praises to the Light and forget not all the powers of the Light which it hath given unto thee.

“‘2. And the powers which are in thee, sing praises to the name of his holy mystery;

“‘3. Who forgiveth all thy transgression, who saveth thee from all the afflictions with which the emanations of Self-willed have constrained thee;

“‘4. Who hath saved thy light **(163)** from the emanations of Self-willed which belong to destruction; who hath wreathed thee with light in his compassion, until he saved thee;

“‘5. Who hath filled thee with purified light; and thy beginning will renew itself as an invisible of the Height.’

“With these words Pistis Sophia sang praises, because she was saved and remembered all things which I had done unto her.”

## CHAPTER 74

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished setting forth these words unto the disciples, that he said unto them: “Who hath understood the solution of these words, let him come forward and say it in openness.”

Mary again came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning these words with which Pistis Sophia hath sung praises, thus thy light-power prophesied them through David:

<small>Mary interpreteth from Psalm cii.</small>

“‘1. My soul, praise the Lord, let all that is in me praise his holy name.

“‘2. My soul, praise the Lord and forget not all his requitals.

<span id="p138"><sup><small>[ p. 138 ]</small></sup></span>

“‘3. Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who healeth all thy sicknesses;

“‘4. Who redeemeth thy life from decay; who wreatheth thee with grace and compassion;

“‘5. Who satisfieth thy longing with good things; thy youth will renew itself as an eagle's.’

“That is: Sophia will be as the invisibles who are in the Height; he hath, therefore, said ‘as an eagle,’ because the dwelling-place of the eagle is in the height, and the **(164)** invisibles also are in the Height; that is: Pistis Sophia will shine as the invisibles, as she was from her beginning.”

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard Mary say these words, that he said: “Well said, Mary, blessed one.”

<small>Sophia is led to a region below the thirteenth æon and given a new mystery.</small>

It came to pass then thereafter, that the First Mystery continued again in the discourse and said unto the disciples: "I took Pistis Sophia and led her up to a region which is below the thirteenth æon, and gave unto her a new mystery of the Light which is not that of her æon, the region of the invisibles. And moreover I gave her a song of the Light, so that from now on the rulers of the æons could not \[prevail\] against her. And I removed her to that region until I should come after her and bring her to her higher region.

“It came to pass then, when I had removed her to that region, that she again uttered this song thus:

<small>She continueth to sing.</small>

“‘1. In faith have I had faith in the Light; and it remembered me and hearkened to my song.

“‘2. It hath led my power up out of the chaos and the nether darkness of the whole matter and it hath led me up. It hath removed. me to a higher <span id="p139"><sup><small>[ p. 139 ]</small></sup></span> and surer æon, lofty and firm; it hath changed my place on the way which leadeth to my region.

“‘3. And it hath given unto me a new mystery, which is not that of my æon, and given unto me a song of the Light. Now, therefore, O Light, all the rulers will see what thou hast done unto me, and be **(165)**afraid and have faith in the Light.’

This song then Pistis Sophia uttered, rejoicing that she had been led up out of the chaos and brought to regions which are below the thirteenth æon. Now, therefore, let him whom his mind stirreth, so that he understandeth the solution of the thought of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, come forward and say it.”

Andrew came forward and said: "My Lord, this is concerning what thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David:

<small>Andrew interpreteth from Psalm xxxix.</small>

“‘1. In patience I tarried for the Lord; he hath given heed unto me and ear unto my weeping.

“‘2. He hath led up my soul out of the pit of misery and out of the filthy mire; he hath set my feet on a rock and made straight my steps.

“‘3. He hath put in my mouth a new song, a song of praise for our God. Many will see and be afraid and hope in the Lord.’”

It came to pass then, when Andrew had set forth the thought of Pistis Sophia, that the First Mystery said unto him: “Well said, Andrew, blessed one.”

## CHAPTER 75

And he continued again in the discourse and said unto the disciples: "These are all adventures which have befallen Pistis Sophia. **(166)** It came to pass then, when I had led her to the region which is below the thirteenth æon, and was <span id="p140"><sup><small>[ p. 140 ]</small></sup></span> about to go unto the Light and depart from her, that she said unto me:

<small>The conversation of Sophia and the Light.</small>

“‘O Light of lights, thou wilt go to the Light and depart from me. And Tyrant Adamas will know that thou hast departed from me and will know that my saviour is not at hand. And he will come again to this region, he and all his rulers who hate me, and Self-willed also will bestow power unto his lion-faced emanation, so that they all will come and constrain me all together and take my whole light from me, in order that I may become powerless and again without light. Now, therefore, O Light and my Light, take from them the power of their light, so that they may not be able to constrain me from now on.’

<small>The Light promiseth to seal the regions of Self-willed.</small>

“It came to pass then, when I heard these words which Pistis Sophia had spoken unto me, that I answered her, saying: ‘My Father, who hath emanated me, hath not yet given me commandment to take their light from them; but I will seal the regions of Self-willed and of all his rulers who hate thee because thou hast had faith in the Light. And I will also seal the regions of Adamas and of his rulers, so that none of them may be able to fight with thee, until their time is completed and the season cometh that my Father give me commandment to take their light from them.’

## CHAPTER 76

“And thereafter I said again unto her: ‘Hearken that I **(167)** may speak with thee about their time, when this which I have said unto thee, will come to pass. It will come to pass when \[the\] three times are completed.’

“Pistis Sophia answered and said unto me: <span id="p141"><sup><small>[ p. 141 ]</small></sup></span> ‘O Light, by what shall I know when the three times will take place, so that I may be glad and rejoice that the time is near for thee to bring me to my region, and moreover rejoice therein that the time is come when thou wilt take the light-power from all them which hate me, because I have had faith in thy light?’

<small>How Sophia will know that the time of her final deliverance hath come.</small>

“And I answered and said unto her: ‘If thou seest the gate of the Treasury of the Great Light which is opened after the thirteenth æon, and that is the left \[one\],—when that gate is opened, then are the three times completed.’

“Pistis Sophia again answered and said: ‘O Light, by what shall I know,—for I am in this region,—that that gate is opened?’

<small>What will come to pass at that time.</small>

“And I answered and said unto her: ‘When that gate is opened, they who are in all the æons will know because of the Great Light which will obtain in all their regions. But see, I have now settled that they shall venture no ill against thee, until the three times are completed. And thou wilt have the power of going down into their twelve æons, **(168)** when it pleaseth thee, and also of returning and going into thy region, which is below the thirteenth æon, and in which thou now art. But thou wilt not have the power of passing through the gate of the Height which is in the thirteenth æon, so as to enter into thy region whence thou didst come down. Moreover, if then the three times are completed, Self-willed and all his rulers will again constrain thee, to take thy light from thee, being enraged against thee and thinking that thou hast imprisoned his power in the chaos, and thinking that thou hast taken its light from it. He will then be embittered <span id="p142"><sup><small>[ p. 142 ]</small></sup></span> against thee, to take from thee thy light, in order that he may send it down into the chaos and it may get down to that emanation of his, so that it may be able to come up out of the chaos and go to his region. Adamas will attempt this. But I will take all thy powers from him and give them unto thee, and I will come to take them. Now, therefore, if they constrain thee at that time, then sing praises to the Light, and I will not delay to help thee. And I will quickly come unto thee to the regions which are below thee. And I will come down to their regions to take their light from them. And I will come to this region whither I have removed thee, and which is below the thirteenth **(169)** æon, until I bring thee to thy region whence thou art come.’

“It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had heard me say these words unto her, that she rejoiced with great joy. But I removed her to the region which is below the thirteenth æon. I went to the Light and departed from her.”

<small>The time for the final deliverance of Sophia is completed.</small>

And all these adventures the First Mystery told to the disciples, that they should come to pass for Pistis Sophia. And he sat on the Mount of Olives, narrating all these adventures in the midst of the disciples. And he continued again and said unto them: "And it came to pass again after this, while I was in the world of men and sat in the way, that is in this region which is the Mount of Olives, before my vesture was sent unto me, which I had deposited in the four-and-twentieth mystery from the interior, but the first from the exterior, which is the Great Uncontainable, in which I am enwrapped, and before I had gone to the Height to receive my second vesture,— <span id="p143"><sup><small>[ p. 143 ]</small></sup></span> while I sat with you in this region, which is the Mount of Olives, that the time was completed of which I had said to Pistis Sophia: ‘Adamas and all his rulers will constrain thee.’

## CHAPTER 77

<small>Adamas sendeth forth two emanations of darkness to plague Sophia.</small>

“It came to pass then, when that time came on,—and I was in the world of men, **(170)** sitting with you in this region, which is the Mount of Olives,—that Adamas looked down out of the twelve æons and looked down at the regions of the chaos and saw his demon power which is in the chaos, that no light at all was in it, because I had taken its light from it; and he saw it, that it was dark and could not go to his region, that is to the twelve moons. Thereon Adamas again remembered Pistis Sophia and became most exceedingly wroth against her, thinking that it was she who had imprisoned his power in the chaos, and thinking that it was she who had taken its light from it. And he was exceedingly embittered; he piled wrath on wrath and emanated out of himself a dark emanation and another, chaotic and evil, the violent \[one\], so as through them to harass Pistis Sophia. And he made a dark region in his region, so as to constrain Sophia therein. And he took many of his rulers; they pursued after Sophia, in order that the two dark emanations which Adamas had emanated, might lead her into the dark chaos which he had made, and constrain her in that region and harass her, until they should take her whole light from her, and Adamas should take the light from Pistis Sophia and give it to the two dark violent emanations, and they should carry it to the great chaos which is below and dark, **(171)** and cast it into his dark power which is chaotic, if perchance it might be able to come to his <span id="p144"><sup><small>[ p. 144 ]</small></sup></span> region, because it had become exceedingly dark, for I had taken its light-power from it.

“It came to pass then, when they pursued after Pistis Sophia, that she cried out again and sang praises to the Light, since I had said unto her: ‘If thou shalt be constrained and singest praises unto me, I will come quickly and help thee.’ It came to pass then, when she was constrained,—and I sat with you in this region, that is on the Mount of Olives,—that she sang praises to the Light, saying:

<small>Sophia again singeth a song to the Light.</small>

“‘1. O Light of lights, I have had faith in thee. Save me from all these rulers who pursue after me, and help me,

“‘2. That in sooth they may never take from me my light, as the lion-faced power \[did\]. For thy light is not with me and thy light-stream to save me. Nay, Adamas is the more enraged against me, saying unto me: Thou hast imprisoned my power in the chaos.

“‘3. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, if I have done this and have imprisoned it, if I have done any injustice at all to that power,

“‘4. Or if I have constrained it, as it hath constrained me, then let all these rulers who pursue after me, take my light from me and leave me empty;

“‘5. And let foe Adamas pursue after my power and seize upon it and take my light from me and cast it into his dark power which is in the chaos, and keep my power in the chaos.

“‘6. Now, therefore, O Light, lay hold on me in thy wrath and lift up thy power above my foes who have lifted themselves up against me to the very end.

<span id="p145"><sup><small>[ p. 145 ]</small></sup></span>

“‘7. Quicken me quickly, as thou hast said unto me: I will help thee.’

## CHAPTER 78

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words unto the disciples, that he said: “Who hath understood the words which I have spoken, let him come forward and set forth their solution.”

James came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning this song which Pistis Sophia hath sung, thus thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the seventh Psalm:

<small>James interpreteth the song from Psalm vii.</small>

“‘1. O Lord, my God, in thee have I hoped. Free me from my pursuers and save me,

“‘2. That in sooth he may never steal away my soul as a lion, without any one to deliver and save.

“‘3. O Lord, my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands,

“‘4. If I have requited those who requite me with evil, then let me fall down empty through my foes.

“‘5. And let the foe pursue after my soul and seize it, and trample my life to the ground and lay my honour in the dust. (Selah.)

“‘6. Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, raise thyself up for the end of my foes.

“‘7. Arise according to the commandment which thou hast commanded.’” **(173)**

It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard James speak these words, that he said: “Well said, James, beloved.”

## CHAPTER 79

And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples: "It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had finished uttering the words of this song, that she turned herself back <span id="p146"><sup><small>[ p. 146 ]</small></sup></span> to see whether Adamas and his rulers had turned back to go to their æon. And she saw them, how they pursued after her. Then she turned unto them and said unto them:

<small>Sophia addresseth Adamas and his rulers.</small>

“‘1. Why pursue ye after me and say: I should not have help, that it \[_sc._ the Light\] should save me from you?

“‘2. Now, therefore, my vindicator is the Light and a strong \[one\]; but it is long-suffering until the time of which it hath said unto me: I will come and help thee. And it will not bring its wrath upon you always. But this is the time of which he hath spoken unto me.

“‘3. Now, therefore, if ye turn not back and cease not to pursue after me, then will the Light make ready its power, and it will make itself ready in all its powers.

“‘4. And in its power hath it made itself ready, so that it may take your lights which are in you, and ye may become dark; and its power hath brought it to pass, so that it may take your power from you and ye go to ground.’

“And when Pistis Sophia had said this, she looked at the region of Adamas and saw the dark and chaotic region **(174)** which he had made, and saw also the two dark exceedingly violent emanations which Adamas had emanated, in order that they might seize Pistis Sophia and cast her down into the chaos which he had made, and constrain and harass her in that region, until they should take her light from her. It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had seen those two dark emanations and the dark region which Adamas had made, that she feared and cried unto the Light, saying:

<span id="p147"><sup><small>[ p. 147 ]</small></sup></span>

<small>Sophia again singeth to the Light.</small>

“‘1. O Light, lo! Adamas, the doer of violence, is wrathful; he hath made a dark emanation,

“‘2. And he hath also emanated another chaos and hath made another dark and chaotic \[one\] and made it ready.

“‘3. Now, therefore, O Light, the chaos which he hath made, in order to cast me down therein and take from me my light-power, take then from him his own.

“‘4. And the plan which he hath devised, to take my light,—they are to take his own from him; and the injustice which he hath spoken, to take my lights from me,—take then all of his.’

“These are the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered in her song. Now, therefore, who is sober in spirit, let him come forward and set forth the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia \[hath uttered\] in her song.”

## CHAPTER 80

Martha again came forward and said: “My Lord, **(175)** I am sober in my spirit and understand the words which thou sayest. Now, therefore, give me commandment to set forth their solution in openness.”

And the First Mystery answered and said unto Martha: “I give thee commandment, Martha, to set forth the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered in her song.”

And Martha answered and said: "My Lord, these are the words which thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the seventh Psalm, saying:

“‘12. God is a righteous vindicator and strong and long-suffering, who bringeth not on his wrath every day.

<span id="p148"><sup><small>[ p. 148 ]</small></sup></span>

<small>Martha interpreteth the words of Sophia from Psalm vii.</small>

“‘13. If ye turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow and made it ready.

“‘14. And he hath made ready for him instruments of death; he hath made his arrows for those who will be burnt up.

“‘15. Behold, injustice hath been in labour, hath conceived wrong and brought forth iniquity.

“‘16. It hath digged a pit and hollowed it out. It will fall into the hole which it hath made.

“‘17. Its wrong will return on its own head, and its injustice will come down on its pate.’”

When Martha had said this, the First Mystery which looketh without, said unto her: “Well said, finely, Martha, blessed \[one\].”
