The _Little Flowers_ is a traditional collection of tales of St. Francis and the early Franciscans. The legend of St. Francis (b. 1181, d. 1226), the patron saint of animals, birds, and the environment, greatly expanded as time went by, and accumulated in this work.

The _Little Flowers_ is a much-loved spiritual classic. This translation by W. Heywood has recently been republished by Vintage, introduced by Madeline L'Engle.
