## PLATE I

<figure id="Figure_pl01" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">

</figure>

Limestone monolith at Pasargadae in Persia sculpured in low relief with a portrait figure of the Fravashi or "genius" of **Cyrus the Great**, the friend of the Jews. The figure of Cyrus is rather larger than life-size, and is winged after the manner of gods and kings on the Assyrian bas-reliefs; and the decoration of the hem of his garment is Assyrian in character. His crown was copied from some Egyptian bas-relief sculptured with the figure of a king, and represents the horus Khnemu or Amen, the two cobras of the Upper and Lower Country, and the triple symbol of royalty resting on solar disks and terminating in disks. The inscription "I \[am\] Cyrus, the King, the Achaemenian" has been broken off. (_See_ [page 190](../5#pl01).)

They are the first private houses of the period to be discovered, and their state of preservation is such that it is possible to reconstruct the general plan of the house of a well-to-do citizen of Ur.

</figure>

A page of the Ethiopic version of the apocryphal work known to ecclesiastical writers as the "Lesser Genesis," and the "Apocalypse of Moses" (British Museum MS. Orient. No. 485, Fol. 83_b_). Because each of the periods of time described in the book contains forty-nine to fifty years, the Ethiopians called it MAZHAFA KÛFÂLÊ, i.e. the "Book of Jubilees." The passage here reproducted describes the tale of Joseph in the 17th year of his age, his going down to Egypt, and his life in that country.

**Interior of a private house** of a citizen of "Ur of the Chaldees" at the time of Abraham. The walls were built of clay bricks, and the floor of the courtyard was paved with flat tile-like bricks. The gallery and its roofs were supported on wooden pillars. The beasts were stabled and stores were kept in the rooms on the ground floor which were entered through arched doorways, and the sleeping and sitting rooms were entered from the gallery. A stairway led from the ground floor to the gallery and the roof. The water supply was kept in large porous pots on the ground floor. About 2100 B.C.
