## OF THE MOST HOLY STIGMATA OF ST. FRANCIS AND OF THEIR CONSIDERATIONS

<p style="text-align:center;">
IN THIS PART WE SHALL BEHOLD WITH DEVOUT<br>
CONSIDERATION THE GLORIOUS, SACRED<br>
AND HOLY STIGMATA OF OUR BLESSED<br>
FATHER, MESSER SAINT FRANCIS,<br>
THE WHICH HE RECEIVED OF<br>
CHRIST UPON THE HOLY<br>
MOUNTAIN OF<br>
ALVERNIA<br>
</p>

_Because the said stigmata were five, even as the wounds of our Lord Jesus Christ were five, therefore this treatise will have five considerations._

_The first consideration will be touching the manner in which St. Francis came to the holy mountain of Alvernia._

_The second consideration will be touching the life which he lived, and the conversation which he held with his companions on the said holy mountain._

_The third consideration will be touching the seraphic vision and the imprinting of the most sacred stigmata._

_The fourth consideration will be how St. Francis descended from the mountain of Alvernia, after he had_ 

<span id="p143">[<sup><small>p. 143</small></sup>]</span>

_received the sacred stigmata, and returned to Santa Maria degli Angeli._

_The fifth consideration will be touching certain Divine visions and revelations made after the death of St. Francis to holy friars and to other devout persons concerning the said sacred and glorious stigmata_.
