“_Tsze-loo said_: “The Prince of Wei has been waiting for you in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?”

“2 _The Master replied_: ‘What is necessary is to rectify names.”

“3 ‘So, indeed!’ _said Tsze-loo_. “You are wide of the mark. Why must there be such rectification?’

“4 _The Master said_: “How uncultivated you are! Yew! A superior man, in regard to what he does not Know, shows a cautious reserve’

“5, ‘If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.

“6 ‘When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music will not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot.

“7 ‘Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires, is just that in his words there may be nothing in correct.’ ”

(CHAPT, Ill, BOOK XIII, TSZE-LOO of _Confucian Analects_)
