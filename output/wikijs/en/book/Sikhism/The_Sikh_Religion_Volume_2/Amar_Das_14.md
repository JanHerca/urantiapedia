When all the ceremonies of Guru Ram Das’s coronation were complete, Guru Amar Das ordered Bhai Budha and other Sikhs to do homage to the newly installed Guru. Then followed a great feast, at which every variety of dishes and dainties were served. Sending for the headmen of Goindwal, the members of his family and all his Sikhs, Guru Amar Das said: ‘God’s summons hath come, and <span id="p150">[<sup><small>p. 150</small></sup>]</span> I am about to depart. God’s will I accept with pleasure. The Creator by calling me hath conferred honour on me; and as true friends, relations, and well-wishers are pleased and never sorry at seeing an honour paid a friend, let there be no mourning for me. When I have gone, sing God’s praises, read God’s word, hear God’s word, and obey God’s will.” Mohri then asked him how his obsequies were to be celebrated. The Guru replied, ' Perform no obsequies for me, place not a lamp in my hands during my last moments. Call me not a ghost as the Hindus do up to the thirteenth day after death. Remember to obey my instructions.’

Mohri put a final question to his father: ‘Thou hast ordered us to lead family lives. This cannot be done without the aid of wealth. What occupation shall we pursue to maintain ourselves ?’ The Guru replied, ‘Live honestly, practise piety, and turn not away from God. Act according to my advice, and you shall be happy.’

The Guru repeated the Japji, drew a sheet over him and amid the surrounding Sikhs’ unbroken cries of Wahguru! Sat Guru! Sat Nam! blended the light of his soul with the light of God. After the Guru’s body had been washed and clothed in costly raiments, it was placed on a beautiful bier, and borne with the singing of the Sikh choristers, to the accompaniment of rebeck and tabla, and amid a rain of flowers, to the margin of the river Bias, where it was cremated with all solemnity. The ashes were afterwards thrown into the river. When the singing was over, the mourners recited the Sohila and distributed sacred food. They then returned home singing the Guru’s praises as they went. Guru Ram Das addressed words of consolation to the Sikhs and the family of the departed.

Guru Ram Das’s glory daily extended like the rays of the rising sun, and the Sikh religion grew like a gigantic tree. It was Guru Nanak who had <span id="p151">[<sup><small>p. 151</small></sup>]</span> sowed the seed from which it sprang. In Guru Angad’s time its trunk towered on high, and its roots penetrated the earth, while during Guru Amar Das’s spiritual reign it put forth its widely spreading branches in every direction.

As the Emperor Akbar administered his empire by the agency of governors of provinces, so Guru Amar Das similarly partitioned the Sikh spiritual empire into twenty-two districts.[^1]

Guru Amar Das, after a spiritual reign of twentytwo years, departed this life at ten o’clock on the forenoon of the day of the full moon in the month of Bhadon,Sambat 1631 (A.D. 1574). There isa yearly fair held on that date at Goindwal to commemorate the act of the Guru’s blending with his Maker.

Mohri had, as we have seen, a son called Anand. Anand’s son was Sundar Das, who afterwards at the request of Guru Arjan wrote the following account of the death of Guru Amar Das. The composition is called the ‘Sadd’ or the ‘Calling’, and is now sung by Sikhs on all occasions of mourning.

## THE SADD

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

God is the Benefactor of the Universe; He loveth the saints and _filleth_ the three worlds.
They in _whose hearts_ the Guru’s instruction is contained know none besides God ;
Under the Guru’s instruction they know none besides ; they meditate on the one Name.
By the favour of Nanak and Guru Angad, _Amar Das_ obtained the supreme position.
When the message came for him to depart, he was absorbed in God’s name.
In this world he obtained the eternal, immovable, and unequalled God by service.

<span id="p152">[<sup><small>p. 152</small></sup>]</span>

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

The Guru gladly accepted the will of God to go to Him![^2]
The true Guru offered a prayer to God, ‘ Protect mine honour ; _this is_ my supplication.
‘Preserve the honour of Thy servant, O bright God, grant me Thy name,
‘That it may assist me at my final departure, and vanquish death and death’s myrmidons.’
God heard the true Guru’s prayer and granted his request ;
He mercifully blended the true Guru with Himself and said, ‘ Bravo! bravo! well done!’

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

‘My disciples, sons, and brethren, hear me; I have received God’s order to go to Him.’
The Guru was pleased with the will of the Lord ; my God congratulated him.
He to whom God’s order is pleasing is a saint of the true Guru:
There are joy and unbeaten strains for him, and God Himself embraceth him.
‘Carefully examine your hearts, my sons, my brethren, and my family.
‘The order written in the beginning cannot be erased ; the Guru is going to God.’

<p style="text-align:center;">IV</p>

The true Guru was pleased to sit up and call his family—
‘Let no one weep when I am gone; that would never please me.
‘When a friend obtaineth a robe of honour, friends who desire his honour are pleased.
‘Consider and behold, my sons and brethren, God clotheth me _with a robe of honour_.’
The true Guru himself while alive appointed a successor to his authority ;

<span id="p153">[<sup><small>p. 153</small></sup>]</span>

He caused all his disciples, relations, sons, and brethren to fall at Ram Das’s feet.

<p style="text-align:center;">V</p>

Finally, the true Guru spoke, “After my death, sing God’s[^3] praises.
‘Call God instead of a pandit and, _for the Garar_ Puran, read God’s word ; [^4]
‘ Read God’s word, hear God’s name; the Guru desireth God’s love _instead_ of a lofty bier,[^5]
‘Barley rolls, bread on leaves, _Hindu_ obsequies, lamps, and throwing his bones[^6] into the Ganges.’
The true Guru spoke as it pleased God, and he was blended with the Omniscient Being.
The true Guru gave Ram Das Sodhi the apostolic mark, the token of the true Word.

<p style="text-align:center;">VI</p>

As the true Guru spoke, so his disciples obeyed his wishes.
His son Mohri became obedient to him, and fell at Ram Das’s feet.
_Then_ all fell at the feet of the true Guru into whom Guru _Amar Das_ had infused his spirit.
Any person who through jealousy[^7] did not bow before him was brought by _the supernatural power_ of the true Guru, and made bow before him.
It pleased God and the Guru to bestow greatness _on Ram Das_ according to God’s will recorded in the beginning.
Saith Sundar, hear me, O saint,[^8] the whole world fell at Ram Das’s feet.

## Footnotes

[^1]: _Manjis_. Literally—couches on which the Gurus used to sit and communicate instruction to their audiences,

[^2]: Some attribute this line to Guru Amar Dis, and translate—What pleaseth God pleaseth me, the Guru is going to God,

[^3]: The use of the word _Nirban_ here for God shows the Guru intended that the Sikh and not the Hindu ritual should be read at his decease.

[^4]: That is, the compositions of the Gurus.

[^5]: _Beban_, from the Sanskrit _viman_, a celestial chariot. Among the Hindus, when an elderly person dies, he is raised on a lofty bier on which flowers, money, almonds, &c., are thrown, and in front of which musicians sing and play.

[^6]: _Phul_. The bones of the departed after the process of cremation.

[^7]: The allusion here is to Guru Amar Das’s eldest son, Mohan, who at first refused to do homage to the new Guru.

[^8]: Guru Arjan is meant.
