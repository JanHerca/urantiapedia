## CHAPTER V

When the Pathans joined Raja Fatah Shah, he asked them what the Guru, whose pay they had been receiving and whose salt they had been eating, must think of them after their desertion. Bhikan Khan <span id="p34"><sup><small>[p. 34]</small></sup></span> replied, ‘ Great king, the Guru is greatly afraid of thee. He only declared war on thee through reliance on us. He offered us shields full of rupees, but we refused and came to thee. He hath only eight men who know how to fight. These are his five cousins, his uncle Kripal, Diwan Nand Chand, and Bhai Daya Ram. The others who are with him are the dregs of the populace, and know not even how to handle a sword. We Pathans shall be too many for them, so it will not be necessary for thy troops to engage at all. The Guru hath treasure exceeding that of an emperor.’ On this Fatah Shah remarked that Providence was kind to him in having already granted him victory. He repeated his promise to the Pathans that they might go and plunder the Guru, and, if he himself possibly could, he would generously reward them out of his own resources also.

The Guru’s scouts, who had been sent to Bhangani, reported that the enemy were marching to the attack. He must therefore proceed at once to intercept them, otherwise they would enter Paunta on the morrow. The Guru sent orders to a body of Udasis to put on their turbans, take their arms, and prepare for defence. The Udasis too did not wish to lose their lives. They said that there were other countries where they might beg for their living, and that the Guru’s kitchen from which they used to eat, was not the only one in the world which remained to them. It was not for the purpose of fighting they had left their homes and become pilgrims. They accordingly resolved to abscond during the night one by one, so that their departure might be unobserved.

Next morning the Guru was informed that the Udasis had all fled except their mahant Kripal, who remained in a state of abstraction. The Guru smiled and said, ‘ The root at any rate is left, and since there is the root the tree shall bear blossom and fruit. If the mahant had gone, the Udasis <span id="p35"><sup><small>[p. 35]</small></sup></span> would have been totally extirpated, and excommunicated from Sikhism.’ The Guru then ordered the mahant to be sent for, and thus addressed him: ‘O mahant, whither have thy Udasis fled ? Hearken tome. Thy disciples eat our sacred food, but when they see a green field elsewhere, they go to graze on it like cattle. They have all absconded in the present hour of need.’ The mahant calmly replied, ‘All disciples of the Gurus are made by thee, and thou thyself canst pardon them.’

While the Guru was conversing with the mahant two Sikhs arrived to report that the army of the hillmen had arrived near Bhangani. The Guru gave orders to his five cousins to take troops and stop the entrance of the enemy into the town. Then making all arrangements for the defence of Paunta during his absence, he sent for his arms and armour and offered the following prayer to the Almighty :—

Eternal God, Thou art our shield,
The dagger, knife, the sword we wield.
To us protector there is given
The timeless, deathless, Lord of heaven ;
To us All-steel’s unvanquished might ;
To us All-time’s resistless flight ;
But chiefly Thou, Protector brave,
All-steel, wilt Thine own servants save.[^1]

Then while repeating his orders he buckled on his sword, slung his quiver over his shoulder, took his bow in his hand, mounted his steed, and shouting ‘Sat Sri Akal’ in his loudest voice proceeded to confront his enemies. It is recorded that the hoofs of the Guru’s horse in their quick movement raised clouds of dust which obscured the sun, and that the cheers of his men resembled thunder in the stormy and rainy month of Sawan.

When the Guru arrived at Bhangani, Bhai Daya <span id="p36"><sup><small>[p. 36]</small></sup></span> Ram pointed out the positions of the armies arrayed against him. ‘ Behold ; there is Fatah Shah’s army, and to the right of it are the faithless Pathans who have deserted us. Behind them all stands Fatah Shah himself. In the van is seen Hari Chand, the Raja of Handur, a brave and accomplished archer.’

Meanwhile a contingent was seen to approach, discharging firearms and committing great havoc among the hillmen. Diwan Nand Chand was puzzled and applied to the Guru for information. A soldier arrived in breathless haste, and said that Budhu Shah had arrived to wipe out the Guru’s taunts for having introduced the Pathans to him. The Guru was of course overjoyed to receive Budhu Shah with his reinforcement, and at once gave the order to charge. Sango Shah, one of the Guru’s cousins, who discharged bullets like hail and committed fearful destruction among the enemy, is specially mentioned on this occasion for his conspicuous gallantry.

Raja Fatah Shah soon learnt that the Pathans had misled him as to the character and strength of the Guru’s army. Raja Hari Chand then suggested that the Pathans under Bhikan Khan, being in the Guru's secret and aware of his plan of operations, should be sent to the front. This was accordingly done. They charged the Guru’s army and used their muskets with great effect. The Guru sent Nand Chand and Daya Ram with their troops to check their onset. Nand Chand and Daya Ram advanced with the rapidity of arrows shot from the Guru’s bowstring. They and their men discharged missiles like winged serpents against the enemy. The Pathans too, fought well, the battle was hotly contested, and many brave men were untimely slain on both sides.

The struggle was continued by both armies with the eagerness of wrestlers striving for victory. Sango Shah continued his brave career and killed many of the enemy. He was well supported by his brother <span id="p37"><sup><small>[p. 37]</small></sup></span> Mahii Chand, who showered bullets with deadly precision on the Pathans, but was at last surrounded as his missiles were exhausted. Sango seeing his brother’s perilous position put his horse at full speed to rescue him, and so deftly applied his arrows, that the Pathans soon surrendered their expected prey and fled.

Budhu Shah, his relations, and his disciples, fought with great bravery and devotion, and succeeded in slaying numbers of the enemy. The ground resembled a red carpet. His men shouted like thunder, and drove the enemy before them as a hurricane drives chaff. Raja Gopal of Guler now arrived with his troops to reinforce Fatah Shah. He called out to the fugitives, “Why run away ? I have come to your assistance.’ On this the hillmen took courage and renewed the combat. They directed their attack principally against Budhu Shah’s troops. Seeing this, Budhu Shah’s sons fought with the greatest bravery, felled the enemy as a woodcutter fells forest trees, and warded off all return strokes, so that they piled up corpses on corpses. Raja Gopal, seeing the destruction of his allies, addressed his men, ‘ My brethren, now is the time for action. Maintain the honour of the hill rajas. The result of this brief exhortation was that the enemy surrounded Budhu Shah’s son. In this critical position he fought with great desperation. His bravery attracted the attention of the Guru himself who sent his uncle Kripal with troops to rescue him. Kripal’s men showered arrows and bullets on the enemy, and succeeded in extricating the youth. He and Kripal then joined in a terrific charge on the hillmen. Raja Gopal seeing this discharged an arrow at Budhu Shah’s son which struck him on the chest, and brought him to the ground. This led to a close engagement of the combatants on both sides for the possession of the body. Every form of weapon was plied and the carnage became <span id="p38"><sup><small>[p. 38]</small></sup></span> terrific. Such was the gallantry of Kripal and the spirit he infused into his followers, that the enemy fled, leaving the corpse of Budhu Shah’s son to be borne away from the field by his father’s disciples for honourable interment.

Raja Gopal, on seeing the confusion produced in his ranks by the brave Kripal, directed his horse at full speed against him. As Gopal advanced he discharged an arrow at him, which lodged in his horse’s saddle. On this Kripal shouted, ‘O Gopal, thou hast had the first shot. It is for me to shoot now.’ On hearing this Gopal turned his horse round. Kripal at once discharged an arrow, which penetrated his horse’s temple, and the animal fell heavily on the ground. Gopal, unhorsed, ran away with the rapidity of a thief who finds day dawning on him in the exercise of his calling, and took refuge at the rear of his troops. He there provided himself with another steed which he mounted for the battle.

The Rajas of Chandel and Handur now appeared on the scene, and desired to come to close quarters with the Guru himself. They and their troops were, however, kept at bay by the bravery of the Guru’s five cousins, supported by the faithful Sikhs.

Raja Fatah Shah now called out to Bhikan Khan and his Pathans, and asked them why they were concealing themselves and saving their skins like dastards. Bhikan Khan had represented that the Guru’s army was worthless, so Fatah Shah now called on him to put that worthless army to flight. He and his men might then return to their homes with such plunder as they could obtain from their victory. Bhikan Khan, thus roused from his lethargy, joined in the fight. Haiyat Khan too advanced and killed several of the Guru’s troopers. Kripal, the mahant of the Udasis, now advanced on horseback, and asked the Guru’s permission to engage Haiyat Khan. The Guru replied, ‘O holy saint, thou canst kill him with thy words. Pray that I may <span id="p39"><sup><small>[p. 39]</small></sup></span> be victorious.’ Kripal, the Guru’s uncle, overhearing this conversation, and seeing that the mahant was filled with martial enthusiasm, prayed the Guru to let him engage Haiyat Khan. The Guru inquired with what weapon the mahant was going ‘to contend with his adversary. The mahant replied, ‘With this club.’ The Guru smiled and said, ‘ Go and engage thine enemy.’ It was a spectacle.to see the mahant with his matted hair twisted round his head, his body only clothed with a thin plaster of ashes, and his belly projecting far in front of his saddle, proceeding to engage a practised warrior armed with the latest weapons of destruction.

When the mahant approached and challenged Haiyat Khan, the latter saw that he had no warlike weapon and consequently retreated from him, scorning to attack a defenceless man. The onlookers were amused and said, ‘How can that faqir contend with a Pathan?’ The mahant, however, continued to challenge Haiyat Khan. As when a snake is escaping into its hole it will come forth if its tail be trodden on and attack the aggressor, so Haiyat Khan, who had been retiring before the mahant, now advanced against him goaded by his taunts. He aimed a blow of his sword at the mahant, which the latter received on his club, when lo! Haiyat Khan’s sword fell to pieces. The mahant then addressed him, ‘Now hold thy ground and defend thyself from me.’ The mahant rose on his stirrups, and wielding his club with both hands struck Hatyat Khan with such force on the head that his skull broke, and his brains issued forth and stained the battle-field.[^2]

<span id="p40"><sup><small>[p. 40]</small></sup></span>

The mahant continued to display his skill and bravery to the Pathans, but was at last surrounded by them and placed in a very hazardous position. When Jit Mal, one of the Guru’s cousins, saw this, he rained such a shower of arrows on the Pathans, that they retreated and left the mahant unmolested. He then made his way to the Guru, and received his approbation.

Ram Singh, a mechanic from Banaras, had made a cannon for the Guru from which balls were discharged with great effect during this battle. People on seeing the impression made on the enemy concluded that the Guru was destined to be victorious.

Bhikan Khan and Niabat Khan taunted their men with being unable to cope with a rabble of villagers who did not even know how to handle a martial weapon. The result was that the Pathans made another desperate effort to brighten their gloomy prospects, and for a time caused the Guru’s army to waver. One Sahib Chand, a captain of a troop, asked the Guru’s permission to oppose the onset of the enemy. The Guru ordered him to act on his own responsibility. Sahib Chand and his men so deftly and rapidly plied their arrows that the Pathans found it necessary to take shelter behind trees. Bhikan Khan, seeing this, addressed his men : “How now, jackals, you are attaching a stigma to the Pathan race. The hillmen are laughing at you, and saying that a faqir, having killed Haiyat Khan, hath put all the Pathans to flight.’ Saying this, <span id="p41"><sup><small>[p. 41]</small></sup></span> Bhikan Khan set an example of bravery to his soldiers, and discharged showers of arrows at the Guru’s troops.

Sahib Chand, on the Guru’s side, continued to fight with great determination, and caused great havoc among the enemy. Seeing this, Hari Chand, the Raja of Handur, became enraged and strove with equal valour against him. His archery was so unerring that the Guru’s army again wavered. Sahib Chand then occupied himself in warding off Hari Chand’s arrows and inspiriting his men. They were not, however, to be encouraged, but were on the point of retreat when the Guru heard a great tumult near him. He at once ordered Nand Chand and Daya Ram to stay the attack of the enemy. These brave heroes discharged such showers of arrows as effectually checked the onward progress of the Pathans. Nand Chand, taking his sword in his hand and putting his horse to full speed, rode into the thick of his enemies, and chopped off their heads like pumpkins severed from their stalks. In his left hand he held a lance with which as occasion served he impaled his antagonists. The Pathans, however, retreated not, but with their religious battle-cry, ‘Ya Ali! Ya Ali!’ firmly held their ground and fell upon Nand Chand. He by his bravery and skill in arms sent every one who approached him to the next world by the way of the sword. A Pathan ran his horse forward and received Nand Chand’s sword on his musket. The sword fell to pieces and then Nand Chand drew forth his two-edged dagger. Daya Ram went to his assistance at that critical moment, and a hand to hand engagement with the Moslems ensued, in which they were worsted and put to flight. Raja Hari Chand still held his ground and was challenged by Daya Ram. Hari Chand avoided not the conflict, but continued to discharge arrows and bullets and inflict great damage on the Guru’s army. His horse <span id="p42"><sup><small>[p. 42]</small></sup></span> was very swift and tractable, and he could turn him rapidly round so as to save himself from a hostile attack, while at the same time he could discharge fatal missiles at his opponents. Saiyid Budhu Shah was found to have lost during the last charge a second son in the battle.

There came a confectioner named Lal Chand to the spot on which the Guru stood directing the battle. He said, ‘I feel greatly tempted to join in the fray, but I have never learned how to handle warlike weapons.’ The Guru replied, ‘ If thou desire to fight, take and mount a horse.’ The confectioner did so. Then the Guru gave him a sword and shield. He inquired how they were to be held. The Guru told him to take the sword in his right hand and the shield in his left. The Guru’s soldiers laughed at the confectioner’s ignorance and said, ‘ Well done! our Guru and great King wants to kill hawks with sparrows.’

The confectioner ran his horse into the Pathan army. Bhikan Khan on seeing him said to his friend Mir Khan, ‘ See, here comes an Arora.[^3] He hath been all day weighing flour and salt, and now the Guru hath given him a sword and shield. Take his arms and his horse, and then slay him.’ Upon this Mir Khan pounced on him like a hawk on a sparrow. When Mir Khan drew his sword the confectioner warded it off with his shield. Then meditating on the Guru he aimed a return blow at Mir Khan which separated his head from his body. The hillmen taunted the Pathans with not being able to contend with petty hucksters, and asked them if they were not ashamed of their cowardice. Provoked by these taunts, Nijabat Khan and Bhikan Khan urged their men to make a general charge and not die like jackals. Raja Hari Chand joined them in their onslaught. The Guru’s brave Sikhs, however, firmly held their ground. In the action that <span id="p43"><sup><small>[p. 43]</small></sup></span> ensued Jit Mal and Hari Chand engaged in single combat. Jit Mal discharged an arrowat Hari Chand, but the latter by an adroit movement of his horse escaped it. Jit Mal became angry at having missed his mark, and discharged another arrow at his opponent. HariChand followed hisexample. Thearrows lodged in their horses’ foreheads and both horses fell. The combatants thus unhorsed continued to fight until they were both wounded. After a short breathing time, both again put forward their strength, when their swords simultaneously took effect. Hari Chand fell fainting to the earth, and Jit Mal dropped down dead with his face to the foe. His comrades blest the father who had begotten him and the mother who had borne him.

When the hillmen found that their bravest warrior had fallen into a swoon, they assembled to consider what should bedone. On seeing the enemy huddled together, the Guru ordered Ram Singh to direct his cannon towards them. Ram Singh obeyed, with the result that several of the enemy were killed. On this the Rajas of Dadhwal and Jaswal became enraged and actively joined in the battle. Fatah Shah, however, saw that the day was lost and took to flight. The Raja of Chandel was astonished at the conduct of Fatah Shah, and continued to do valiant battle on behalf of the hill chiefs.

At the time when Jit Mal and Hari Chand were engaged in single combat, Sango Shah, the Guru’s cousin, and Niabat Khan, the Pathan leader, were similarly employed, and both fell by mutual slaughter. The Guru, on seeing the courage and fate of the hero who had performed for him such gallant deeds, changed his name from Sango to Shah Sangram—Lord of battle. The Guru, enraged at his loss, mounted his charger and rode into the thick of the combat. He so plied his arrows that sounds of woe arose on all sides from the Pathan ranks. The Guru, on seeing the renegade Bhikan Khan, <span id="p44"><sup><small>[p. 44]</small></sup></span> discharged an arrow at him. It missed him but killed his horse, upon which he took to flight. Nand Chand and Daya Ram now saw an opportunity in the demoralized state of the Pathans to make a final desperate charge and complete their discomfiture. The result was great slaughter of the treacherous Muhammadans. When the hillmen saw the total defeat of the Pathans, they too began to run away from the field of battle.

Raja Hari Chand, who swooned on_ being wounded by Jit Mal, had by this time recovered, and appeared on the scene with the heroic resolution to secure victory for his side. He addressed his troops: ‘Hillmen, once so brave, why die like cowards ? I have come to your assistance. Take courage. Saying this the Raja stayed the fleeing hosts. Meanwhile showers of arrows continued to speed from the Guru’s army. Raja Hari Chand shot many brave men with his own arrows. The Guru on seeing this confronted him, and afterwards thus described the combat that ensued :—

Hari Chand, in his rage, drew forth his arrows. He struck my steed with one and then discharged another at me, but God preserved me and it only grazed my ear in its flight. His third arrow penetrated the buckle of my waist-belt and reached my body, but wounded me not. It is only God who protected me, knowing me His servant. When I felt the touch of the arrow, my anger was kindled. I took up my bow and began to discharge arrows in abundance. Upon this my adversaries began to flee. I took aim and killed the young chief, Hari Chand. When he perished my heroes trampled their enemies under foot. The chief of Korori was seized by death. Upon this the hillmen fled in consternation and I, through the favour of the eternal God, gained the victory. Having thus held the battle-field, we raised aloud the song of triumph. I showered wealth on my warriors and they all rejoiced.

Raja Fatah Shah saw there was only safety in <span id="p45"><sup><small>[p. 45]</small></sup></span> flight, and hastened to retire to his capital. Praises of the Guru’s valour and skill in warfare were sung throughout the country.

## Notes

[^1]: This is freely translated from a version of the first lines of the _Akal Ustat_ found in Malcolm’s _Sketch of the Sikhs_.

[^2]: The Guru himself gives the following description of this single combat and of the fighting which immediately followed :—
  Mahant Kripal, raging, lifted his mace and smote the fierce Haiyat Khan on the head, upon which his brains issued bubbling forth as butter from the earthen vessel which Krishan broke. Nand Chand raged in dreadful ire, launching his spear, then wielding his scimitar, When the keen weapon broke, he drew forth his dagger for the honour of the Sodhi race. Then my maternal uncle, Kripal, advanced in his rage. The brave man’s body received many arrows, yet he emptied the saddle of many a Turkish chief. Sahib Chand, as a true Kshatri, strove in the battle’s fury and slew bloodthirsty leroes, shining lights of Khurasan. Many excellent warriors were slain, and those who survived fled with their lives. Sango Shah, lord of battle, gloriously acquitted himself, and trampled underfoot bloodthirsty Pathans. Raja Gopal shouted as he stood in the battle-field, like a tiger in the midst of deer. ‘The brave Hari Chand planted his feet firmly on the field and in his fury discharged sharp arrows which went through and through his adversaries. —_Vichitar Natak_.
