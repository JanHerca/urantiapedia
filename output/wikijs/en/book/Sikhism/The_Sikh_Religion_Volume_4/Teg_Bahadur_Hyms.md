## HYMNS OF GURU TEG BAHADUR

[^1]

<p style="text-align:center;">GAURI</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

O good people, renounce your mental pride,
Day and night flee from lust, wrath, and the company of the evil.
He who recognizeth pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour as the same,
And who keepeth aloof from joy and sorrow, knoweth the Real Thing in the world.
One should renounce praise and blame and search for the dignity of Nirvan :
Nanak, this is a difficult part to play ; only a few pious men know _how to do so_.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

O good people, God hath _thus_ made creation—
Some perish, others think that they shall live for ever ; this is a wonderful thing and cannot be understood.
Mortal is in the power of lust, anger, and worldly love, and hath forgotten God.
The body which, like a nightly dream, is unreal man deemeth real.[^2]
Whatever is visible shall all vanish like the shadows of the clouds :
Nanak, they who know that the world is unreal shall abide under God’s protection.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

The praise of God entereth not into the heart of man ;
Day and night he remaineth absorbed in mammon ; say how shall he sing _God’s_ praises. <span id="p394"><sup><small>[ p. 394 ]</small></sup></span>
In this way he bindeth himself to children, friends, mammon, and selfishness.
This world is false as a mirage, _yet man_ on beholding it fleeth after it.
The Lord, the Cause of happiness in this world and the next, is forgotten by the fool.
Nanak, among millions few there are who find _the way_ to worship God.

<p style="text-align:center;">IV</p>

O good people, the heart cannot be restrained ;
It is fickle, greed abideth with it, therefore it cannot be kept stable :
Within it is violent rage which causeth all wisdom to be forgotten,
And which hath stolen the jewel of divine knowledge from all men : nothing can withstand it.
All the Jogis making efforts and the eulogists singing God’s praises have failed to _steady their minds_.
Nanak, when God is merciful, everything is successful.

<p style="text-align:center;">V</p>

O good people, sing God’s praises :
You have obtained priceless human life ; why waste it in vain ?
Enter into the sanctuary of God who is the purifier of sinners and the friend of the poor.
Why forget Him, by remembering whom the elephant’s fear departed ?
Lay aside pride, worldly love, and self, and then apply your minds to God’s worship.
Nanak saith, this is the way of salvation ; become a follower of the Guru and you shall attain it.

<p style="text-align:center;">VI</p>

O mother, let some one instruct this erring mind.
Man hath heard the Veds and the Purans and the ways of holy men, yet he singeth not God’s praises even for a moment ; <span id="p395"><sup><small>[ p. 395 ]</small></sup></span>
Having obtained a human body so difficult to obtain, he passeth his life in vain.
Worldly love is a very toilsome forest, yet man conceiveth love for it.
He feeleth no love for God who is ever with him at home and abroad.
Nanak, consider him in whose heart God is contained as delivered.

<p style="text-align:center;">VII</p>

O good people, in God’s asylum there is rest.
The advantage of the study of the Veds and the Purans is to remember God’s name.
The man who is untouched by covetousness, worldly love, selfishness, joy, and sorrow,
And who is not a slave to his passion, is the image of God ;
So is he who deemeth heaven and hell, ambrosia and poison, gold and copper, as the same ;
And so also is he who deemeth praise and blame as the same, and who is not enslaved by avarice and worldly love :
Recognize him as possessed of divine knowledge who hath not the entanglements of pain and pleasure.
Nanak, admit that such a mortal is saved.

<p style="text-align:center;">VIII</p>

O man, why hast thou become crazy ?
Knowest thou not that life decreaseth day and night, and that thou art degraded by avarice ?
In the body and the beautiful house and wife which thou deemest thine own,
Thou hast no share ; see and carefully reflect on this.
Thou hast lost the jewel of _human_ life, and thou knowest not God’s way ;
Thou hast not been absorbed in the feet of _the Lord_ even for a moment, and thou hast passed thy life in vain.
Saith Nanak, that man is happy who singeth God’s name and praises ;
Mammon hath bewitched all the rest of men; they shall not obtain the fearless dignity.

<span id="p396"><sup><small>[ p. 396 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">IX</p>

O heedless man, fear sin.[^3]
Enter the protection of Him who is compassionate to the poor and the destroyer of every fear.
Clasp to thy heart the name of Him whose praises the Veds and Purans sing.
Pure is the name of God in the world ; by ever remembering it all filth of sin shall be cleansed.
Thou shalt not again obtain a human body; make some efforts now for thy deliverance.
Nanak saith, by lauding Him who is full of mercy thou shalt cross the terrible ocean.

<p style="text-align:center;">ASA</p>

To whom shall I describe man’s troubles ?
The prey of avarice he hasteth in every direction in the hope of wealth ;
For the sake of pleasure he undergoeth much suffering, and is the slave of every individual ;
Like a dog he wandereth from door to door, and heedeth not God’s worship ;
He loseth his human life in vain, and is not ashamed of men’s laughter.
Nanak, why dost thou not sing God’s praises so that thine evil inclinations may depart ?

<p style="text-align:center;">DEVGANDHARI</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

Man doeth not a particle of my bidding.
I have been instructing him, yet he abstaineth not from wickedness ;
He hath gone mad by the intoxication of mammon, and repeateth not God’s praises ;
By fraud he deceiveth the world and filleth his own belly ;
Like a dog’s tail he is never straight, and lendeth not an ear to what I tell him. <span id="p397"><sup><small>[ p. 397 ]</small></sup></span>
Saith Nanak, continually repeat the name of God, so shalt thou be successful.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

All thy relations are only for life ;
Thy mother, father, brothers, sons, kinsmen, and the wife of thy house,
When the soul parteth from thy body, cry out and call thee a ghost ;
Nobody keepeth thee even half a ghari; they expel thee from the house.
The structure of the world is like a mirage ; understand this and ponder on it in thy heart.
Saith Nanak, ever repeat God’s name by which deliverance is obtained.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

I have seen that the love of the world is false ;
Everybody, whether wife or friend, is intent on his own happiness ;
Everybody speaketh of his relations, and attacheth his heart to them with love ;
At the last moment nobody will accompany him : this is a strange custom.
Stupid man as yet understandeth nothing, though I have grown weary of continually instructing him.
Nanak, if man sing the praises of God, he shall cross over the terrible ocean.

<p style="text-align:center;">BIHAGRA</p>

Nobody knoweth God’s ways ;
Jogis, jatis, penitents, and several wise men have grown weary _thinking_ of Him ;
He can in a moment make a beggar a king, or a king a beggar ;
What is empty He filleth, and what is full He emptieth ; this is a practice of God ;
He-hath spread His own illusion, and He Himself beholdeth it ;
He assumeth many shapes and _playeth_ many sports, yet is distinct from everything. <span id="p398"><sup><small>[ p. 398 ]</small></sup></span>
Incomputable, illimitable, unseen, and spotless is He who hath unsettled all men’s minds.
_Saith_ Nanak, O mortal, lay aside all doubt, and think upon God’s feet.

<p style="text-align:center;">SORATH</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

O man, love God ;
Hear His praises with thine ears, and sing His songs with thy tongue.
Associate with holy men, remember God, and thou shalt be cleansed from sin.
Death wandereth about, O friend, like a serpent with protruding fangs,
And it will seize thee sooner or later; understand this in thy heart.
Saith Nanak, worship God; thine opportunity is passing away.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

Man’s intentions are never carried out ;
He neither adoreth God, nor worshippeth at places of pilgrimage,[^4] so Death seizeth him by the top-lock.
Know that wives, friends, sons, carriages, property, wealth, the whole world,
And everything else is false; only adoration of God is tie.
Grown weary of wandering about for many ages, man hath _at last_ obtained a human body :
Nanak saith, O man, it is now thy turn to meet _God_ ; why not remember Him ?

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

O man, what evil inclinations hast thou entertained ?
Thou hast found pleasure in other men’s wives and in calumny, and God thou hast not served ;
Thou hast not known the way of deliverance, but hast hurried to amass wealth. <span id="p399"><sup><small>[ p. 399 ]</small></sup></span>
At last nothing shall accompany thee ; in vain hast thou entangled thyself.
Thou hast not worshipped God, nor served holy men, nor hath any divine knowledge sprung up in thy heart.
God is in thy heart, _yet_ thou searchest for Him in the wilderness ;
Thou hast grown weary of wandering in many births, and hast not acquired a stable mind ;
Having now acquired a human body worship God’s feet ; Nanak giveth thee this advice.

<p style="text-align:center;">IV</p>

O man, think of seeking God’s protection ;
Fix His praises in thy heart, by meditating on whom such a person as the courtesan was saved ;
By remembering Him Dhru became immovable, and obtained the fearless dignity.
Why hast thou forgotten the Lord, who is such a Remover of sorrow ?
When the elephant took the protection of the Ocean of mercy, he escaped from the crocodile.
How far shall I describe the praises of the Name? He who repeateth it bursteth his bonds.
The sinner Ajamal, the world knoweth, was saved in a moment.
Nanak saith, think upon the Fulfiller of desires, and thou too shalt be saved.

<p style="text-align:center;">V</p>

What efforts shall mortal make
By which he may obtain God’s service and dispel the fear of death ?
Say what science _shall he study_, and then what acts and religious ceremonies shall he perform ?
What is that great name, by remembering which man may cross the dreaded ocean ?
In the Kal age there is one Name, that of the Ocean of mercy, by repeating which man may obtain deliverance ;
There is no other religious ceremony equal to that, as shown by sacred writings. <span id="p400"><sup><small>[ p. 400 ]</small></sup></span>
He who is called the Lord of the earth, remaineth ever free from joy and sorrow, uncontaminated _by the world_,
And unaffected by it, O Nanak, like a mirror ; He dwelleth within thee.

<p style="text-align:center;">VI</p>

O mother, how shall I behold the Lord of the earth ?
In the darkness of great worldly love and spiritual ignorance my heart hath been entangled ;
I have lost the whole of my life in wandering, and not obtained a stable mind ;
I have night and day pursued sinful pleasures, and have not abandoned sinful habits.
I have never associated with saints or sung God’s praises.
Nanak, in me is no virtue; take me, _O God_, under Thy protection.

<p style="text-align:center;">VII</p>

O mother, my heart is not under my control ;
Night and day it chaseth sinful pleasures ; how shall I restrain it ?
Although I have heard the teachings of the Veds, the Purans and the Simritis, yet I have not given them a place in my heart for an instant ;
I have coveted others’ goods and others’ wives, and have passed my life in vain ;
I have become mad with the intoxication of mammon, and I know not any divine knowledge ;
The Pure One dwelleth in my heart, _yet_ I know not His SEEret.
Since I have entered the asylum of the Saints,[^5] my evil thoughts have all dispersed.
Nanak, when I thought upon the Fulfiller of desires, Death’s noose was cut.

<p style="text-align:center;">VIII</p>

O man, hold this for certain in thy heart— The whole world is like a dream, and in its destruction there shall be no delay. <span id="p401"><sup><small>[ p. 401 ]</small></sup></span>
As a wall of sand, even when elaborately built lasteth not four days,
So is the pleasure of mammon ; why art thou entangled in it, O ignorant man ?
This very day come to thy senses; no harm is yet done ; repeat God’s name.
Saith Nanak, I have proclaimed unto thee, _O man_, the special teaching of holy men.

<p style="text-align:center;">IX</p>

I have seen no friend in this world ;
The whole world is attached to one for its own interest, but man will have no companion in adversity.
Wives, friends, sons, and relatives are all attached to wealth ;
When they see a man poor, they all forsake his company and flee.
What shall I say to this demented heart which is attached to them ?
I have forgotten the praises of the Lord of the poor and the Destroyer of fear ;
However much I have striven, my heart remaineth as crooked as a dog’s tail, and will not straighten.
_Saith_ Nanak, _O God_, have regard for Thy practice of _forgiveness_ ; I have uttered Thy name.

<p style="text-align:center;">X</p>

O man, thou hast not embraced the Guru’s instruction,
What availeth thee to shave thy head, and put on an ochre-dyed garment ?
Having abandoned truth thou hast attached thyself to falsehood, and lost thy _human_ life in vain ;
Thou hast filled thy belly by deceit, and slept like a beast ;
Thou knowest not how to worship God, and thou hast sold thyself to mammon.
O madman, thou hast remained entangled with sin, and forgotten the jewel of the Name ;
Thou hast been thoughtless, thou hast not thought of God, thou hast passed thy life in vain. <span id="p402"><sup><small>[ p. 402 ]</small></sup></span>
Saith Nanak, O God, recognize Thy daily practice _of forgiveness_ ; mortal ever erreth.

<p style="text-align:center;">XI</p>

He who in adversity heedeth it not,
Who in prosperity feeleth neither affection nor fear, and who deemeth gold as dross ;
Who uttereth neither praise nor blame, and who suffereth not from avarice, worldly love, or pride ;
Who is unaffected by joy or sorrow, by honour or dishonour ;
Who hath renounced all hopes and desires, and expecteth nothing from the world ;
Whom lust and wrath touch not—in such a person’s heart God dwelleth.
He to whom the Guru hath shown favour knoweth the way to this,
And shall be blended with God, O Nanak, as water with water.

<p style="text-align:center;">XII</p>

My dear friends, know this in your hearts—
The whole world is entangled in its own pleasures; nobody is any one else’s _friend_.
In prosperity many persons come and sit together by one, encircling him on all sides ;
When adversity befalleth him, all abandon him and nobody cometh near him.
The wife of one’s home who hath been dearly loved, and who hath ever been attached to her husband,
On the departure of his soul from his body fleeth away crying, “Ghost! ghost!’
Such is the conduct of those whom we love :
At the last moment, Nanak, none but God is of any avail.

<p style="text-align:center;">DHANASARI</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

O Sir, why goest thou to search in the forest ?
God though ever apart dwelleth everywhere, and is contained even in thee. <span id="p403"><sup><small>[ p. 403 ]</small></sup></span>
As in flowers there is odour and in a mirror reflection,
So God dwelleth continually in thy heart ; search for Him there, O brother.
_Whether thou art_ abroad or at home, know that there is but one God ; this knowledge the Guru hath given me.
Nanak, without knowing thyself the scum of doubt shall not be removed.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

O good people, this world hath been led astray by superstition ;
It hath forsaken the memory of God’s name, and it hath been sold to mammon.
It is involved in the love of mother, father, brother, son, and wife ;
Day and night it is mad with the intoxication of youth, wealth, and splendour ;
It is not attached to Him who is compassionate to the poor and ever the Destroyer of sorrow.
Nanak, among millions few there are who become attached to the Guru and recognize God.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

Think not that that Jogi
In whose heart thou recognizest covetousness, worldly love, and selfishness is united with God.
He who neither calumniateth nor flattereth others, to whom gold and iron are the same,
And who is free from joy or sorrow, is properly called a Jogi.
The restless mind of man hasteth in every direction, but whoever steadily fixeth it,
Saith Nanak, thou mayest rest assured is saved.

<p style="text-align:center;">IV</p>

What effort shall I now make
That my mental anxiety may be at an end, and may cross the terrible ocean ?
I have done nothing good since I was born, wherefore I fear the more ; <span id="p404"><sup><small>[ p. 404 ]</small></sup></span>
I have not sung God’s praises in thought, word, or deed ; in my heart I feel anxious regarding this ;
Although I have heard the Guru’s instruction, yet no spiritual knowledge hath resulted ; I fill my belly like a beast— |
Saith Nanak, O God, adopt Thy daily practice of _forgiveness_, and I a sinner shall be saved.

<p style="text-align:center;">JAITSARI</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

My erring mind hath been entangled with mammon ;
The more works I performed when devoted to avarice, the more I entangled myself ;
I had no understanding, I devoted myself to sinful pleasures, and I forgot God’s praises ;
The Lord who was with me I did not recognize, I ran searching for Him into the forest.
The jewel of God was in my heart, but I knew it not.
Nanak, without worshipping God life is lost in vain.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

O God, preserve mine honour :
When the fear of Death entered my heart, I clung to Thine asylum, O Ocean of mercy.
I was a great sinner, stupid and avaricious, but I have now grown weary of committing sin.
I have not forgotten the fear of Death; in my anxiety my body hath wasted away,
I have been running in every direction contriving plans for my salvation ;
But though the pure God dwelt in my heart, I knew it not.
I have no virtues nor have I performed devotion or penance : what work shall I now perform ?
Nanak, I have grown weary and have sought Thy protection ; O God, grant me salvation.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

O man, embrace true instruction. Admit that without the name of God all this world is false ; <span id="p405"><sup><small>[ p. 405 ]</small></sup></span>
Know that the Lord, for whom the Jogis grow weary of searching without finding His limit,
Is near thee, _but_ without form or outline.
God’s name is the purifier of the world, yet thou hast never remembered it.
_Saith_ Nanak, I have entered Thine asylum; O Thou to whom the world boweth down, preserve me as is Thy practice.

<p style="text-align:center;">TODI</p>

What shall I say of my baseness ?
I have been entangled in the love of gold and woman, and have not sung God’s praises.
Believing this false world to be true I conceived an attachment for it ;
I never remembered the Protector of the poor, who is my companion and helper ;
I remained night and day absorbed in worldly affairs, and the filth of my heart forsook me not.
Saith Nanak, I have now nowhere salvation except in the protection of God.

<p style="text-align:center;">TILANG</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

O mortal, if thou have wisdom, then think of God night and day ;
Every moment life is passing away like water from a cracked vessel.
Why singest thou not the praises of God, thou ignorant fool ?
Attached to false avarice thou hast not thought of death ;
No harm hath yet been done if thou even now sing God's praises.
Saith Nanak, by singing them thou shalt obtain the fearless dignity.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

Awake, O man, awake ; why dost thou heedlessly sleep ?
The body which was born with thee shall not depart with thee ; <span id="p406"><sup><small>[ p. 406 ]</small></sup></span>
The mother, father, sons, and relatives whom thou lovest,
Will throw thy body into the fire when the soul departeth from it.
Know that the affairs of the world last only during life.
Nanak, sing God’s praises ; everything is like a dream.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

O man, sing the praises of God who is with thee :
The opportunity is passing away, obey my words.
Thou hast loved too well wealth, equipages, women, and empire.
When Death’s noose falleth on thy neck, all shall become the property of others.
O madman, thou hast intentionally ruined thine affairs ;
Thou didst not shrink from the commission of sin or dismiss pride.
Hear, O my brother, how the Guru hath instructed me.
Nanak loudly proclaimeth—seek God’s protection.

<p style="text-align:center;">BILAWAL</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

Recognize God’s name as the remover of sorrow :
Know in thy heart that by remembering Him Ajamal and the courtesan were saved ;
The elephant’s fear departed directly he muttered God’s name.
The boy Dhru listened to Narad’s instruction, and became engrossed in worship ;
He obtained the durable, immortal, and fearless rank, and the world was amazed.
Nanak saith, admit that God the Protector of saints is near thee.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

Without God’s name thou shalt suffer ;
Without piety doubts are not at an end; the Guru gave me this secret.
If thou enter not God’s asylum, what shall pilgrimage and fasting avail thee ? <span id="p407"><sup><small>[ p. 407 ]</small></sup></span>
Be assured that the practice of Jog and sacrificial feasts are fruitless if man forget the praises of God.
Such man as layeth aside both pride and worldly love, and singeth God’s praises,
Saith Nanak, shall be said to have obtained salvation during life.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

He in whom there is no devotion to God,
Hath lost his life in vain ; bear this in mind.
I speak verily unto you; believe his piety to be fruitless
Who performeth pilgrimage and even fasting, but who hath not control over his heart.
As water penetrateth not stone immersed in it,
So deem that mortal who worshippeth not.[^6]
In the Kal age salvation is obtained by the name _of God_ ; the Guru discloseth this secret.
Saith Nanak, he is a great man who singeth God’s praises.

<p style="text-align:center;">RAMKALI</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

O my soul, take shelter in God’s name ;
By remembering it evil thoughts are dispelled, and the rank of nirvan obtained.
Know that that man is very fortunate who singeth God’s praises ;
Having lost the sins of different births he shall go to heaven.
At the last moment Ajamal thought of God,
And obtained in an instant the state which superior Jogis desire.
The elephant had no merits, no learning, and what _religious_ ceremonies had he performed ?
Yet, O Nanak, behold the daily practice of God who granted him safety.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

O my good people, what way shall man now adopt
By which all evil thoughts may be dispelled and his heart be steeped in devotion to God. <span id="p408"><sup><small>[ p. 408 ]</small></sup></span>
The heart remaineth entangled by mammon, and knoweth naught of divine knowledge.
Whose name is that in the world by remembering which thou shalt obtain the rank of nirvan ?
When the saints were compassionate and kind they taught me this—
Know that he who hath sung God’s praises hath performed all religious duties ;
And he who night and day claspeth God’s name to his heart, even for a moment,
Shall lose all fear of Death and reform his life.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

O mortal, think of God:
Every moment life decreaseth ; night and day it passeth away in vain.
Thou hast lost thy youth in sensual pleasures and thy childhood in ignorance ;
Thou hast grown old and even now thou understandest not in what folly thou art entangled.
Why hast thou forgotten God who gave thee human birth ?
Thou hast not sung for a moment _the praises_ of Him by remembering whom man obtaineth salvation.
Why art thou proud of worldly wealth ? it will not depart with any one.
Nanak saith, think upon the Fulfiller of desires ; He will be our Helper at last.

<p style="text-align:center;">MARU</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

God’s name ever bestoweth comfort ; By remembering it Ajamal was saved, and the courtesan also obtained deliverance ;
Panchali[^7] at the royal assemblage remembered the name of God ; <span id="p409"><sup><small>[ p. 409 ]</small></sup></span>
The Merciful One removed her suffering and enhanced His own renown.
The Ocean of mercy assisteth whomsoever hath sung His praises ;
Saith Nanak, relying on this I have come and sought His protection.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

Now what shall I do, O mother ?
I have lost my whole life in sensual pleasures and have not remembered God.
When Death throweth his halter on my neck, I shall have lost all my reason.[^8]
Except the name of God what shall assist me in that affliction ?
The wealth thou deemest thine own becometh in one moment another’s.
Saith Nanak, I have been reflecting in my mind that I have never sung God’s praises.
<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>
O mother, I have not renounced the pride of my heart ;
I have passed my life in the intoxication of worldly love, and have not applied myself to the worship of God.
When Death’s mace fell upon my head, then I awoke from my slumber.
But what availeth present repentance ? I shall not escape even by running.[^9]
When this thought arose in my mind I fell in love with the Guru’s feet.
Life is only profitable, Nanak, when we are absorbed in God’s praises.

<span id="p410"><sup><small>[ p. 410 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">BASANT</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

O good people, know that this body is temporary ;
The God who dwelleth within it recognize as permanent.
This world is like wealth _obtained in_ a dream; why be elated on beholding it ?
Why are you wrapped up in it? nothing shall depart with you.
Renounce both flattery and slander ; take God’s praises to thy heart.
Nanak, the one God filleth all things.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

The sinner hath given lust a seat in his heart ; [^10]
Wherefore his restless mind is not restrained.
This net of lust is cast
Over Jogis, Jangams, and Sanyasis.
They who remember the name of God
Cross over the terrible ocean.
The slave Nanak _hath taken_ refuge in God ;
Grant me Thy name, _O God_, that I may continue to sing Thy praises.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

O mother, I have obtained God’s name as my wealth ;
My heart hath ceased to wander and lain down to rest.
Worldly love and selfishness have fled from my body, and pure spiritual knowledge hath sprung up 7 me.
Avarice and worldly love cannot touch me; I have embraced God’s service.
When I acquired the jewel of the Name, the fear of continual birth was at an end.
When all covetousness hath departed from the heart it is absorbed in special happiness.
He to whom the Ocean of mercy is compassionate, singeth His praises. <span id="p411"><sup><small>[ p. 411 ]</small></sup></span>
Saith Nanak, this form of wealth some rare holy man obtaineth.

<p style="text-align:center;">IV</p>

O my soul, why hast thou forgotten God’s name ?
When the body perisheth thou shalt have to do with Death.
This world is a hill of smoke ;
What induced thee to consider it real ?
Understand that wealth, wife, property, and home
Will not depart with thee ;
The worship of God alone will accompany thee.
Saith Nanak, adore Him with unmixed love.

<p style="text-align:center;">V</p>

Why hast thou gone astray and attached thyself to false avarice ?
There is no harm done if even to-day thou awake.
Know that this world is like a dream ;
It will be destroyed in a moment ; accept this as true.
Adore that God day and night, O my friend,
Who dwelleth continually with thee.
Sing the praises of Him,
Saith Nanak, who will assist thee at the last moment.

<p style="text-align:center;">SARANG</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

Thou hast no helper but God ;
Who hath a mother, father, son, or wife? who hath a brother ?
Of all the wealth, land, and property which thou deemest thine own,
Nothing shall depart with thee when thou diest ; why art thou wrapped up in them ?
Thou hast not increased thy love for Him who is compassionate to the poor and ever the Destroyer of misery.
Nanak saith, the whole world is unreal like a nightly dream.

<span id="p412"><sup><small>[ p. 412 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

O my soul, why art thou entangled in sensual pleasures ?
In this world none may remain ; one cometh and another goeth.
Who hath body and wealth ? who hath property ? what shall one love ?
Everything which is visible shall vanish like the shadow of a cloud.
Lay aside pride, grasp the protection of the saints, and thou shalt at once obtain salvation.
Nanak, without worshipping God there is no happiness even in one’s dreams.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

Why, O man, hast thou wasted thy life ?
Intoxicated by worldly love thou hast attached thyself to sensual pleasures and not entered God’s protection.
This world is all a dream ; so why art thou covetous ?
Everything that was created shall perish; nothing shall be allowed to remain.
This temporary body thou deemest permanent; in this way hast thou entangled thyself.
Nanak, only he who. applieth his mind to the adoration of God, shall obtain salvation in this world.[^11]

<p style="text-align:center;">IV</p>

I never heartily sang the praises of God ;
I remained attached to sensual pleasures night and day, and did what pleased myself.
I never carefully listened to the Gurw’s instruction: I became entangled with others’ wives.
I busied myself greatly in calumniating others, and understood not the counsels I received. |
How far shall I describe my acts—how I have wasted my life ?
Saith Nanak, in me are all demerits ; protect me, O God, I have come to thy sanctuary.

<span id="p413"><sup><small>[ p. 413 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">JAIJAWANTI</p>[^12]

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

Remember God, remember God, this is thy duty ;
Abandon the companionship of worldly love ; cling to God’s sanctuary ; admit that the pleasures of the world are false ; everything is unreal.
Consider wealth as a dream; of what art thou proud ? the empire of the earth is as a wall of sand.
The slave Nanak saith, thy body shall be destroyed ; yesterday passed away moment by moment, so also shall to-day.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

Adore God, adore God ; thy life passeth away.
Why should I warn thee every moment ? why understandest thou not, O fool ? The body is like hail, it vanisheth in a moment.
Reject all doubt and repeat God’s name; at the last moment this alone will depart with thee.
Forsake sensual pleasures as poison; take the praise of God to thy heart ; Nanak proclaimeth, the opportunity is passing away.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

O man, what shall be thy condition ?
In this world the only _means of salvation_ is God’s name to which thou hast not attentively listened; thou hast been excessively addicted to sensual pleasures, and not diverted thy thoughts from them.
Thou hast obtained human life, yet thou hast not remembered God for a moment ; thou hast been in subjection to the charms of woman and thy feet are fettered.
Nanak proclaimeth, the extension of the world is like a dream ; why thinkest thou not upon God to whom mammon is but a handmaiden ? [^13]

<p style="text-align:center;">IV</p>

Thy life shall pass away, shall pass away in vain in a Though thou hearest night and day the ancient histories, <span id="p414"><sup><small>[ p. 414 ]</small></sup></span> yet, O silly man, thou understandest them not ; Death hath arrived ; whither shalt thou flee ?
That body of thine which thou thinkest permanent shall become dust; why repeatest thou not the name of God, thou shameless fool ?
Introduce the service of God into thy heart ; renounce mental pride, so shalt thou, Nanak asserteth, be illustrious in the world.

## Notes

[^1]: The hymns of the ninth Guru are not found in the oldest copy of the Granth Sahib preserved at Kartarpur. They were incorporated in the sacred volume by the tenth Guru at Damdama.

[^2]: That is, permanent.

[^3]: The gyanis generally translate this verse—O man, fear even unintentional sin.

[^4]: By pilgrimage is here meant the society of saints.

[^5]: The Gurus, his predecessors.

[^6]: Religious instruction will have no effect on his hard heart.

[^7]: Yudhishtar, the eldest of the five Pandav princes, staked his kingdom, his brothers, himself, and lastly his wife Draupadi in a gambling match with Duryodhan the eldest of the Kaurav princes, and lost them all. Duryodhan finding himself in possession of Draupadi ordered her to sweep his house. On her refusal she was dragged by Dhusisan, Duryodhan’s brother, before an assemblage of the Kauravs. He endeavoured to pull off her clothes, but God saved her from disgrace. Draupadi is here called Panchili, for she was daughter of Driipad the king of Panchal.

[^8]: I shall have no consciousness to repent and make up for lost opportunities.

[^9]: Also translated—Unfortunate that I am, I shall not escape.

[^10]: Also translated—Man hath implanted sinful lust in his heart.

[^11]: That is, shall obtain salvation during life.

[^12]: The ninth is the only Guru who has written in this measure.

[^13]: Why worship the servant instead of the Master?
