## CHAPTER VI

After a protracted residence at Patna Guru Teg Bahadur turned his thoughts towards the Panjab, and communicated his resolve to return thither to his mother Nanaki. Hesaid to her, ‘ O mother dear, it is now a long time since I left the Panjab. If thou permit me, I will go, give instruction to my Sikhs there, and lead them the right way. Remain here with thy grandson and nurse him. When he groweth strong, bring him to me.’ His mother became very thoughtful on hearing this, and represented that the Panjab was politically in a very unsettled state. Moreover, he had been Jong absent in the Kamrup country, had only now returned, and it was too soon to leave her again. While thus speaking tears of love rained from her eyes. The Guru represented to her that man’s body was unstable, and vain was love for it. He on that occasion composed the following hymn :—

I have seen that love of the world is false ;
Everybody, whether wife or friend, is intent on his own happiness ;
Everybody speaketh of his relations, and attacheth his heart to them with love ;
At the last moment nobody will accompany him ; this is a strange custom.
Stupid man as yet understandeth nothing, though I have grown weary of continually instructing him.
Nanak, if man sing the praises of God, he shall cross over the terrible ocean.[^1]

On hearing this hymn the Guru’s mother was <span id="p362"><sup><small>[p. 362]</small></sup></span> consoled, and offered no further objection to her son’s departure.

The Guru then addressed himself to his wife Gujari, ‘O my good wife, I am going to the Panjab. The city of Anandpur which hath been built must be inhabited. Remain here, bring up thy son, and oppose not his wishes. After some time I will send for thee. My reason for asking thee not to thwart him is because he is the beloved servant of the Deathless Being. When he groweth up, he shall perform great deeds for the world. He shall destroy the evil and cherish his religion. J have received God’s order to go to the Panjab, and discharge several duties there. Ever remember the Deathless Being.’ On hearing this his wife’s eyes filled with tears, and she replied in her weeping, ‘ O my husband, I have none but thee. Our child is still young. My mother-in-law is old. To whom art thou going to entrust me?’ The Guru replied, ‘This body is temporary, the soul is ever permanent. The composition of the body is like that of the current of a river. Whoever fixeth his love on it isa fool. Be satisfied with whatever is God’s will. Knowing this give thy mind contentment. Ever love thy son and repeat the true Name.’

After this conversation the Guru’s son went to him and said, ‘ Father dear, I have heard that thou art going to the Panjab. Take me with thee.’ [^2] The Guru replied, ‘My son, thou art still young. Thou wouldst have great suffering on the way. Therefore remain here for some time, and I will send for thee afterwards. It is thou who hast to do all the work at Anandpur.’ At the Guru’s departure his wife pressed him not to make a long march on that day and to keep his child with him, so that the parting between father and son might not be too <span id="p363"><sup><small>[p. 363]</small></sup></span> abrupt, and that the latter might be able to endure it without too much sorrowing. To this the Guru agreed. His first march was within the city of Patna itself, where all his Sikhs went to bid him farewell and sing the Gurus’ hymns for his safe journey.

The Guru taking with him his treasurer, the devout Mati Das, and four other faithful Sikhs, proceeded march by march till he arrived at Ropar in the Ambala district, where a large crowd of Sikh followers came to see him and make him offerings. He then directed his route to Kiratpur, where he met his half-brother Suraj Mal, who was overjoyed at seeing him. To him the Guru communicated the news of the birth of his son, whereat Suraj Mal was greatly delighted. He introduced his grandsons Gulab Rai and Sham Das to the Guru, who bestowed costly dresses on them. While staying at Kiratpur, the Guru visited Patalpuri where Guru Har Gobind had breathed his last. The Guru after staying at Kiratpur for some time departed for Anandpur. When he arrived, there was great rejoicing. The whole city went forth to receive him and do him homage.

Gobind Rai, though still a child, used daily to practise the use of arms. Whenever the sons of worthy men and Sikhs visited him, he used to instruct them in military tactics. In Gobind’s area was a well of sweet water which the neighbours used to draw. One day as a Muhammadan woman went with her pitcher a pellet from the boy’s bow accidentally struck her on the forehead. She went with tears and lamentations to Gujari, and threatened to report to the Emperor the mischief the child had been doing in the city. The mother pleaded that her son was still very young, and knew not right from wrong. After further parley Gujari gave her money to buy clarified butter and sweets, upon which she promised that she would make no further complaint against Gobind Kai.

<span id="p364"><sup><small>[p. 364]</small></sup></span>

Gujari chased the boy with the object of chastising him. He ran upstairs and closed the door behind him. She then began to scold, and asked him if he was not afraid of the Emperor. He called out to her that he was afraid of none but the Deathless God. On hearing this his mother desisted from her intention, and Nanaki, his grandmother, then quietly went upstairs and brought him down to his mother. Addressing the latter Nanaki said, ‘The boy shall be a great warrior like his grandfather, Guru Har Gobind.’

## Notes

[^1]: Devgandhari.

[^2]: Supposing this to have been really uttered by the child Gobind Rai, it would show that his father Guru Teg Bahadur had spent a considerable time on the expedition, and again at Patna after his return.
