## SLOKS OF GURU TEG BAHADUR

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

He who singeth not God’s praises rendereth his life useless ;
Saith Nanak, worship God, O my soul, as the fish loveth water.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

Why art thou enamoured of the deadly sins ? thou renouncest them not for a moment.
Saith Nanak, repeat God’s name, O my soul, so that Death’s noose may not fall on thee.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

Youth hath passed away in vain, old age hath overcome the body ;
Saith Nanak, worship God, O my soul, thy life passeth away.

<p style="text-align:center;">IV</p>

Thou hast become old ; knowest thou not that thy time hath arrived ?
Saith Nanak, O crazy man, why worshippest thou not God ? 

<p style="text-align:center;">V</p>

Wealth, wife, riches, all that thou deemest thine own—
None of these shall depart with thee ; Nanak, know this as true.

<p style="text-align:center;">VI</p>

God is the Saviour of sinners, the Dispeller of fear, the Lord of the helpless ; Saith Nanak, know Him, He dwelleth ever with thee.

<span id="p415"><sup><small>[ p. 415 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">VII</p>

Thou hast not loved Him who gave thee a human body and wealth :
Saith Nanak, O crazy man, why dost thou abjectly tremble ?

<p style="text-align:center;">VIII</p>

Saith Nanak, hear O man, why rememberest thou not God
Who gave thee _human_ body, wife, wealth, prosperity, and commodious mansions ?

<p style="text-align:center;">IX</p>

God and no other is the Bestower of all happiness ;
Saith Nanak, hear, O man, by remembering Him deliverance is obtained.

<p style="text-align:center;">X</p>

Adore God, O my friend, by remembering Him deliverance is obtained ;
Saith Nanak, hear, O man, life is ever growing shorter.

<p style="text-align:center;">XI</p>

O clever and wise man, know that thy body is composed of five elements ;
Be sure, Nanak, that thou shalt blend with that from which thou hast sprung.

<p style="text-align:center;">XII</p>

The saints proclaim that God dwelleth in every heart—
Saith Nanak, adore Him, O man, and thou shalt cross over the terrible ocean.

<p style="text-align:center;">XIII</p>

Saith Nanak, hear, O man, in God’s image is he
Who is unaffected by weal or woe, by covetousness, worldly love, or pride.

<p style="text-align:center;">XIV</p>

Saith Nanak, hear, O man, know that he is saved
Who _uttereth_ neither praise nor blame, and to whom gold and iron are the same.

<span id="p416"><sup><small>[ p. 416 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">XV</p>

Saith Nanak, hear, O man, know that he is saved
Who feeleth neither joy nor sorrow, and who treateth an enemy and a friend as the same.

<p style="text-align:center;">XVI</p>

Saith Nanak, hear, O man, call him a person possessed of divine knowledge,
Who inspireth no fear, and who hath no fear of others.

<p style="text-align:center;">XVII</p>

Saith Nanak, hear, O man, good fortune is inscribed on that man’s forehead,
Who hath abandoned all evil passions, and donned the garb of retirement.

<p style="text-align:center;">XVIII</p>

Saith Nanak, hear, O man, God dwelleth in the heart of him
Who hath abandoned mammon and selfishness, and renounced everything.

<p style="text-align:center;">XIX</p>

The man who having renounced selfishness recognizeth
God as the Creator, Saith Nanak, is saved ; be sure, my soul, that this is true.

<p style="text-align:center;">XX</p>

In the Kal age God’s name is the destroyer of fear and the banisher of evil thoughts ; He who night and day repeateth it, Nanak, shall be successful in his undertakings.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXI</p>

Utter God’s praises with thy tongue, and hear God’s name with thine ears ;
Saith Nanak, hear, O man, thou shalt not then be put into Death’s prison.

<span id="p417"><sup><small>[ p. 417 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">XXII</p>

The mortal who renounceth selfishness, covetousness, worldly love, and conceit, 
Saith Nanak, shall be saved himself and shall save others.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXIII</p>

Know that the world is like a dream or[^1] a play ;
There is nothing real in it, Nanak, but God.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXIV</p>

Day and night mortal wandereth after wealth ;
Among millions, O Nanak, few there are who remember God. 

<p style="text-align:center;">XXV</p>

As bubbles are formed from water and continually disappear ;
So was this world constructed,[^2] saith Nanak; hear this, O my friend. 

<p style="text-align:center;">XXVI</p>

Mortal, blinded by the intoxication of mammon, payeth no heed to anything ; Saith Nanak, without uttering God’s name Death’s noose shall fall on him. 

<p style="text-align:center;">XXVII</p>

If thou desire eternal happiness take God’s protection ;
Saith Nanak, hear, O man, difficult of attainment is human birth.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXVIII</p>

Fools and ignorant people run after wealth ;
Saith Nanak, without repeating God’s name their lives pass in vain.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXIX</p>

Know that that mortal is like God who worshippeth night and day ;
Between God’s saint and God there is no difference ; Nanak, recognize that this is true.

<span id="p418"><sup><small>[ p. 418 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">XXX</p>

Man is entangled with mammon and forgetteth God’s name ;
Saith Nanak, without repeating God’s name of what avail is life ?

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXI</p>

Mortal blinded by the intoxication of mammon remembereth not God ;
Saith Nanak, without worshipping God Death’s noose shall fall on man.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXII</p>

Man shall find many companions in weal, but none in woe ;
Saith Nanak, worship God, O man, and He will assist thee at the last _moment_.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXIII</p>

Man wandereth about in various births without having his fear of death removed ;
Saith Nanak, O man, worship God, and thou shalt dwell in the fearless state.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXIV</p>

I have made many efforts, but have not effaced the pride of my heart ;
I am bound by my evil thoughts, saith Nanak; preserve me from them, O God.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXV</p>

Know that there are three stages of life, childhood, youth, and then old age ; 
Saith Nanak, admit that they are all in vain without worshipping God. 

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXVI</p>

What thou oughtest to have done thou hast not done ; thou hast fallen into the net of covetousness ;
Nanak, the opportunity hath now passed away; why weepest thou, O blind man ?

<span id="p419"><sup><small>[ p. 419 ]</small></sup></span> 

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXVII</p>

The heart is absorbed in mammon and cannot escape from it, O my friend ;
As a picture painted on a wall, O Nanak, leaveth it not.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXVIII</p>

 Man desireth one thing, but something different happeneth ;
 He meditateth deceiving others, O Nanak, and a halter Is put round his neck.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXIX</p>
 
Man maketh many efforts to obtain happiness, but none to obtain misery ;[^3] 
Saith Nanak, hear, O man, what pleaseth God happeneth.

<p style="text-align:center;">XL</p>

The world goeth about begging ; God is the Bestower of all; 
Saith Nanak, remember Him, O man, and thy desires shall be fulfilled. 

<p style="text-align:center;">XLI</p>

Why entertainest thou false pride? Know that the world is like a dream ;
In it there is nothing which is thine, Nanak preacheth.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLII</p>

Man is proud of his body which perisheth in a moment, my friend ;
The man who reciteth God’s praises, Nanak, hath conquered the world.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLII</p>

Know that he in whose heart there is recollection of God, hath obtained salvation ;
Between that man and God there is no difference ; Nanak, accept this as a fact. : 

<p style="text-align:center;">XLIV</p>

Consider that person, O Nanak, as a hog or a dog
In whose heart there is no devotion to the one Ged.

<span id="p420"><sup><small>[ p. 420 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">XLV</p>

As a dog never abandoneth his master’s house,
Nanak, in the same way worship God with single mind and single heart.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLVI</p>

Going on pilgrimages, fasting, and giving alms, while pride is in the heart,
Nanak, these things are as fruitless as an elephant's bathing.[^4]

<p style="text-align:center;">XLVII</p>

Thy head shaketh, thy legs totter, thine eyes are devoid of lustre ;
Saith Nanak, this is the case with thee, yet thou art not absorbed in God’s love.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLVIII</p>
I have particularly observed that in this world no one is another’s friend ; Nanak, only devotion to God is permanent; preserve that in thy heart.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLIX</p>

Know, my friend, that the structure of the world is all unstable ;
Saith Nanak, like a wall of sand it is not permanent.

<p style="text-align:center;">L</p>

Ram passed away, Rawan passed away with his large family ;
Saith Nanak, nothing is permanent; the world is like a dream.

<p style="text-align:center;">LI</p>
Be anxious only regarding what is not expected ; [^5] <span id="p421"><sup><small>[ p. 421 ]</small></sup></span>
It is the way of the world, Nanak, that nothing is permanent.

<p style="text-align:center;">LII</p>

What is born dieth to-day, to-morrow, or the next day ;
Nanak, sing God’s praises, and lay aside all entanglements.

<p style="text-align:center;">LVII</p>[^6]

God’s name to which nothing is equal I have clasped to my heart ;
By remembering it my troubles are at an end, and I behold Thee, O God !

## Notes

[^1]: _Ar_ in the original. ‘The word, however, eenerally means ‘and.’

[^2]: That is, men are born and die like bubbles.

[^3]: It comes of itself according to prenatal acts.

[^4]: There can be no purity as long as sin dwells in the heart ; ablutions will then be like those of the elephant which after being bathed bespatters himself with mud.

[^5]: If thy friends die, weep not over much for them, as their death is certain.

[^6]: Sloks LIII, LIV, LV, and LVI have already been given in the Life of Guru Teg Bahadur.
