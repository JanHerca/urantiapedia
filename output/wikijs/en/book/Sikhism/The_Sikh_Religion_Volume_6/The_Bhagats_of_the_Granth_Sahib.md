## THE BHAGATS OF THE GRANTH SAHIB

[^1]

There have lived in India from time immemorial saints and thinkers who were dissatisfied with the superstitions and religious vagaries of the Hindus. They gradually evolved a belief in one God and preceded Guru Nanak as the dawn before sunrise. Abrupt indigenous alterations of religion have rarely, if ever, been presented to human experience. Some of the writings of the Gum’s immediate precursors called Bhagats, or saints, are preserved in the Granth Sahib compiled by Guru Aijan- He selected for inclusion therein, with equal impartiality the writ¬ ings of both Hindus and Musalmans, as they suited his purpose, and contributed to the great cause of religious reformation. We find in the sacred volume compositious of Jaidev, Namdev, Trilochan, Parmanand, Sadlma, Beni, Ramanand, Dhanna, Pipa, Sain, Kabir, Rav Das, Sur Das, verses of at least two Musalman saints, Farid and Bhikan j and one recension of the sacred volume called Eanno’s Granth, preserved at Mangat in the Gujrat district of the Panjab, contains a hymn composed by Mira Bai, Queen of Cbitaur. It is believed that Gum Arjan did not give it a place in his collection because the lady lived and died an idolater.

The Hindu Bhagats for the most part began life as worshippers of idols, but by study and con¬ templation arrived at a system of monotheism wMdi was appreciated by Guru Arjan, The Muhammadan Bhagats lived in Hindu centres, and became largely iinbned with Hindu modes of thought, w'bile they <span id="p2"><sup><small>[ p. 2 ]</small></sup></span> at the same time retained their traditional belief in the Divine nnity. There is no account given of these saints in any of tlie classical Sikh writings; but we have to the best of our power collected materials for the lives of moat of them in the various places where they were born or where they flourished in India, Some civil officers have kindly made inquiries and furnished ns with details from their districts, and political officers have also assisted in procuring information from the annals of native states.

The writings of Nabhaji, Uddava Chidghan, Mahipati, Ganesh Dattatre, Maliaraja Raghuraj Sinha, Dahyabhai Ghelabhai pandit, and others in different Indian languages, on the mediaeval saints of India have also been consulted.

Nabhaji, the author of the _Bhagat Mal_, was born in the state of GuaJiar. His original name is said to have been Narain Das, Everything relating to him is as wonderful as the legends he himself relates of his Vaishnav saints. He was born blind. When he was about five years of age there was a great fannine in the land, and he was deserted by his parents in a forest, owing to their inability to rnaiH’ tain him. He was found by Agar Das and Kil, two Hindu pilgrims, who were on their way to the Ganges. He told them his history, and they adopted him, Kil sprinkled some holy water from his gourd on the child’s eyes, and he received his sight. He was employed to wait on the holy men, and in this capacity heard many legends of Indian saints of all epochs, These legends he recorded at the suggestion of Agar Das in a work called _Sant Charitra_, which formed the basis of his _Bhagat Mal_, a series of metrical chronicles in the Gualiar dialect, written about A. D. 1578. He was a contemporary of Raja Man Sjnh of Jaipur, and consequently lived during the reign of the Efiiper&r Akbar. It is recorded that lie liad an interview with Tulsi Das, the famous <span id="p3"><sup><small>[ p. 3 ]</small></sup></span> Hindu poet, who flourished in the reign of Shah Jahan. If so he must have lived to a very advanced age. Several additions and amplifications were made to Nabhaji’s work by Priya Das and Pandit Lai Ji of Bindraban. It was subsequently written out in Hindu prose and translated into Urdu by different hands. Other writers in most of the great Indian dialects have written lives of the Vaishnav saints, but almost all are avowedly based on the work of Nabhaji.

Nabhaji’s _Bhagat Mal_ is in all versions painfully disappointing. It may be compared to the mediaeval legends of saints once current in Europe, but it has the additional defect of brevity, and, like Hindu works generally, shows a total contempt for chronology. When one great man is but an incarnation of another who lived hundreds or thousands of years before, it seems superfluous to the Hindu biographer to consider such a trifle as the date of his successive appearances upon earth. Even the jjions Hindus who at different times expounded and translated Nabhaji’s work, each and all pass by the dates of the Ehagats without a word of apology to the reader. We are therefore generally left to shreds of extraneous evidence for the epochs of the Bhagats whose writings are contained in the Bible of the Sikhs.

Uddava Chidghan was bom in Dharur in Khandesh. Once when he was celebrating the anniversary^ of the birth of Rama, and taking an image of that god into his house at Bedar in the Barars, some bigoted Muhammadans stoned the procession. A fight arose between the Hindus and Muhammadans. It is said that Hanuman, the monkey-god, espoused tlie cause of the Hindus, and fought against the Muhammadans, as he bad done thousands of years before against Rawan. By Hanuman's aid Chidghan's party was victorious, and succeeded in burning a mosque in which the Muhammadans had <span id="p4"><sup><small>[ p. 4 ]</small></sup></span> concealed themselves. The era in which Chidghan flourished has not been accurately ascertained.

Mahipati was bom in A. D. 1715 at Taharabad, in the Rahruri subdivision, about thirty-five miles from Ahmadnagar in the Bombay Presidency. He wrote the lives of saints in the Marathi language. His authorities were principally Nabhaji and Uddava Qiidghan. He has himself given the Shaka year 1696 (A. D. 1774) as the date of the completion of his _Bhakta Lilamrita_. He died in A. D. 1790.

Maharaja Raghnraj Sinh, son of Maharaja Viswanath Sinh of the Baghel dynasty, chief of the Rew state, was born in a.Ei, 1823, and died in 1S80. He inherited his literary talents from his father, who wrote a paraphrase of Kabir’s _Bijak_, and about fifty tracts on Hindu religion, philosophy, and literature. Maharaja Raghuraj Sinh was one of the most renowned Hindi poets of his time, and he was also a most generous patron of the many Hindi and Sanskrit scholars who flocked to his court. Tn religion he was a strict a^ierent of Vaishnav tenets.

We shall attempt to give the Lives and Writings of the Bhagats in chronological order.

## Notes

[^1]: The word _Bhagat_ comes from the Sanskrit _bhakti_, which means devotion love, &c.
