## KABIR'S SLOKS

<p style="text-align:center;">I</p>

Kabir, my rosary is my tongue, on which I repeat God's name ;
In every age it bringeth peace and comfort to all God's servants.

<p style="text-align:center;">II</p>

Kabir, everybody laugheth at my caste ;
I am a sacrifice to this caste in which I repeat the Creator's name.

<p style="text-align:center;">III</p>

Kabir, why waverest thou ? Why lettest thou thy mind vacillate ?
God is the Lord of all happiness ; quaff the essence of His name.

<span id="p279"><sup><small>[ p. 279 ]</small></sup></span>

Kabir, if golden earrings were to be made and rubies set in them,
They would appear like burnt reeds if God's name were not in the _wearer's_ heart. [^1]

<p style="text-align:center;">V</p>

Kabir, there are few who while alive are dead, [^2]
And who fearlessly sing God's praises ; whithersoever I look there is He _to save me_.

<p style="text-align:center;">VI</p>

Kabir, on the day I am dead there shall be rejoicing after me ; [^3]
I shall _then_ have met my God, and my friends will worship Him _instead of weeping_.

<p style="text-align:center;">VII</p>

Kabir, I am the worst of men ; except myself everybody is good ;
He who holdeth the same opinion is my friend.

<p style="text-align:center;">VIII</p>

Kabir, _worldly love_ came to me in various disguises,
But my guru preserved me ; _worldly love then_ made me obeisance and _departed_.

<p style="text-align:center;">IX</p>

Kabir, destroy that _Maya_ whose death shall make thee happy ;
Every one shall _then_ say it is well ; no one shall _deem it_ ill.

<p style="text-align:center;">X</p>

Kabir, when the nights are dark, thieves arise ;
They run about with nooses _for men_ ; know that they are accursed of God.

<span id="p280"><sup><small>[ p. 280 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">XI</p>

Kabir, the sandal-tree is good even though surrounded by the dhak-tree ; [^4]
If the latter be near the sandal-tree, it will also become fragrant as sandal.

<p style="text-align:center;">XII</p>

Kabir, the bamboo is drowned in its pride ; [^5] may nobody be drowned so !
It may grow near the sandal, but it is never perfumed by it. [^6]

<p style="text-align:center;">XIII</p>

Kabir, man hath lost his faith through mammon, but mammon will not accompany him ;
He hath carelessly struck his foot with an axe by his own hand.

The following is said to have been written in reply to some one who had invited Kabir to attend a religious fair : —

<p style="text-align:center;">XIV</p>

Kabir, wherever I wandered I saw spectacles everywhere ;
Without the saint who loveth God, _the world_ is in my opinion a desert.

<p style="text-align:center;">XV</p>

Kabir, the hut of the saints is comfortable ; the village of the false is a furnace.
May fire prey upon that mansion where the name of God is not !

<p style="text-align:center;">XVI</p>

Kabir; why weep when a saint dieth, since he is merely going home ?
Weep _rather_ for the poor infidel who is sold at every shop. [^7]

<span id="p281"><sup><small>[ p. 281 ]</small></sup></span>

Kabir, the infidel is like a dinner of garlic ;
One may sit in the corner and eat it, _but its smell_ becometh manifest at last.

<p style="text-align:center;">XVIII</p>

Kabir, the body [^8] is a churn, the breath _of life_ its churningstaff ;
The saints eat the butter, the world drinketh the buttermilk.

<p style="text-align:center;">XIX</p>

Kabir, the body is the churn, the breath _of life_ the stream of iced water ; [^9]
He who hath churned shall eat the butter, and 50 shall his helpmates also.

<p style="text-align:center;">XX</p>

Kabir, Maya is a thief who breaketh into and robbeth the shop ; [^10]
One man, Kabir, who hath chased her in every direction, [^11] she shall not rob. [^12]

<p style="text-align:center;">XXI</p>

Kabir, they who make many friends are not happy in this world ;
But they who keep their minds fixed on the one God ever enjoy happiness.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXII</p>

Kabir, while the world feareth death, my heart is pleased therewith ;
Since it is only by death supreme bliss is obtained.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXIII</p>

Kabir, when thou obtainest the jewel of God's _name_ keep it to thyself, [^13] <span id="p282"><sup><small>[ p. 282 ]</small></sup></span>
_For_ there is no bazaar _to sell it in_, no connoisseur, no purchaser, no price _for it_.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXIV</p>

Kabir, love him who _hath made_ God his master ;
Learned men, kings, lords of the soil — of what avail is _love for them_ ?

<p style="text-align:center;">XXV</p>

Kabir, by loving the one God all other love departeth,
Whether thou wearest long hair, or shavest thy head clean. [^14]

<p style="text-align:center;">XXVI</p>

Kabir, the world is a chamber of soot ; blind are they who enter it, _and they become defiled_.
I am a sacrifice to those who have entered it, and come forth clean.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXVII</p>

Kabir, this body shall depart ; if possible detain [^15] it :
They who had hundreds of thousands and millions departed barefooted.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXVIII</p>

Kabir, this body shall depart ; put it on some road
On which it may either hold converse with saints, or sing God's praises.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXIX</p>

Kabir, everybody dieth in his turn, but no one even knoweth how to die ;
When thou diest, so die that thou shalt not have to die again. [^16]

<p style="text-align:center;">XXX</p>

Kabir, it is difficult to obtain human birth ; it cometh not again and again ;
As the ripe fruit of the forest, when it falleth to the ground returneth not to the _parent_-branch.

<span id="p283"><sup><small>[ p. 283 ]</small></sup></span>

Somebody came to visit Kabir, and asked him if Kabir (great) was his name. The following, addressed to God, was his reply : —

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXI</p>

It is Thou, O God, who art Kabir (_great_), and whose name is Kabir (_great_) ;
Man shall only obtain the jewel of the Lord when he despiseth his body.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXII</p>

Kabir, utter not idle complaints _against God_ ; nothing shall result from what thou sayest ;
No one can set aside what the merciful One doeth.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXIII</p>

Kabir, nobody who is counterfeit can withstand God's touchstone ;
Only he who in life is dead can bear its ordeal.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXIV</p>

Kabir, men wear gaudy robes, and eat betel leaves and betel nut ;
But without the name of the one God they shall be bound and taken to the city of Death.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXV</p>

Kabir, my boat is old, and leaketh in a thousand chinks ;
_Boats_ very lightly laden cross over, but those with _heavy_ cargoes [^17] founder.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXVI</p>

Kabir, _man's_ bones burn like firewood, his hair burnetii like grass ;
Kabir is sad on seeing everybody burning. [^18]

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXVII</p>

Kabir, be not proud of thy bones wrapped up in skin ;
They who rode excellent horses, _and_ under umbrellas, were at last buried in the earth.

<span id="p284"><sup><small>[ p. 284 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXVIII</p>

Kabir, be not proud on seeing thy lofty dwellings ;
To-day or to-morrow thou shalt lie _beneath_ the earth, and the grass shall grow over thee.

<p style="text-align:center;">XXXIX</p>

Kabir, be not proud, let none laugh at the poor ;
Now thy bark is on the sea ; who knoweth what shall happen. [^19]

<p style="text-align:center;">XL</p>

Kabir, be not proud on seeing thy beautiful body ;
Thou shalt leave it to-day or to-morrow as a serpent its slough.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLI</p>

Kabir, if thou must plunder, then plunder, but let thy plunder be the name of God ;
_Otherwise_ thou shalt afterwards repent _when_ life hath left thy bodv.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLII</p>

Kabir, few [^20] have been born who have applied the fire of _divine knowledge_ to their bodies,
Who have burnt the five evil passions, and with _the same fervour_ continued to love God.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLIII</p>

Is there any one who will sell me his son ; any one who will sell me his daughter ? [^21]
_Is there any one_ who wall go into partnership with Kabir, and deal in God's _name_ with him ?

<p style="text-align:center;">XLIV</p>

Kabir, I remind thee, O man — and entertain no doubt on the subject — <span id="p285"><sup><small>[ p. 285 ]</small></sup></span>
Thou canst not exchange the pleasures thou hast already enjoyed for even a morsel of coarse sugar. [^22]

<p style="text-align:center;">XLV</p>

Kabir, I _first_ thought that learning was good, then that the Jog _philosophy_ was better than learning ;
But _now_ I shall never forsake the service of God, even though men revile me for it.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLVI</p>

Kabir, how can the wretched people who have no divine knowledge in their hearts, revile me ? [^23]
Kabir having abandoned every occupation continueth to repeat God's name.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLVII</p>

Kabir, the wanderer's skirt hath caught fire on all sides ; [^24]
The tattered garment hath been burnt and reduced to charcoal, but the flame hath not touched the waist-string. [^25]

<p style="text-align:center;">XLVIII</p>

Kabir, the tattered garment hath been burnt and reduced to charcoal, the skull hath burst into atoms ;
The poor Jogi hath had his day, and dust only remaineth where he sat.

<p style="text-align:center;">XLIX</p>

Kabir, man is like a fish in a little water ; the angler casteth in his net ;
Man shall not escape in this little pond ; he ought to think of returning to the Ocean. [^26]

<p style="text-align:center;">L</p>

Kabir, leave not the Ocean, though it be very brackish ; [^27] <span id="p286"><sup><small>[ p. 286 ]</small></sup></span>
If thou search for shelter in every pond, [^28] no one shall call thee good.

<p style="text-align:center;">LI</p>

Kabir, they who had no guru were wafted away ; there was no one to stop them —
Practise meekness and humility, [^29] come what may.

<p style="text-align:center;">LII</p>

Kabir, the bitch of God's saints is good, but the mother of the infidel is bad ;
The former ever heareth the Lord's name and praises, the latter goeth to commit sin.

<p style="text-align:center;">LIII</p>

Kabir, man is like a lean stag ; this world is a lake surrounded by verdure ;
There are hundreds of thousands of hunters and but one life — how long can it escape ? [^30]

<p style="text-align:center;">LIV</p>

Kabir, if thou make thine abode on the bank of the Ganges, thou may est drink pure water ;
_But_ thou shalt not obtain salvation without devotion to God ; the great departed have said this. [^31]

<p style="text-align:center;">LV</p>

Kabir, me whose mind is pure as Ganges water,
God followeth and addresseth, ‘ Kabir ! Kabir !’ [^32]

<p style="text-align:center;">LVI</p>

Kabir, turmeric is yellow and lime white ;
When both colours are blended, the beloved God is met. [^33]

<span id="p287"><sup><small>[ p. 287 ]</small></sup></span>

Kabir, turmeric then loseth its yellowness, and not a trace of _the whiteness_ of lime remaineth ;
I am a sacrifice to that love by which tribe and caste and lineage are effaced.

<p style="text-align:center;">LVIII</p>

Kabir, the door of salvation is narrow, _the breadth_ of the tenth of a grain of mustard ;
The mind is _as large as an_ elephant ; [^34] how can it pass through ?

<p style="text-align:center;">LIX</p>

Kabir, if I meet a true guru and he kindly favour me, The door of salvation shall be _made_ wide, and I can easily pass through.
Kabir's hut once fell, and people asked him to repair it ; the following was his reply : —

<p style="text-align:center;">LX</p>

Kabir, I have no hut or shed ; I have no house or village ;
I have no caste or name that God should ask who this man is.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXI</p>

Kabir, I desire to die, _but_ when I die let it be at God's gate,
So that God may ask, ‘ Who is this lying at My door ? ’

<p style="text-align:center;">LXII</p>

Kabir, I did not do this, nor will I do it again, nor am I physically able to do it ;
How do I know what God may have done ? Yet it was all Kabir. [^35]

<span id="p288"><sup><small>[ p. 288 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">LXIII</p>

Kabir, the skin of my body shall be shoes for his feet
From whose mouth in his muttering dream issueth God's name.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXIV</p>

Kabir, we are puppets of clay, but bear the name of men ;
Though guests for only four days, we occupy very great space.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXV</p>

Kabir, I have converted myself into henna and thoroughly ground myself,
But, even so, God never inquired about me and never allowed me to touch His feet.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXVI</p>

Kabir, the door from which no visitor is repelled
How shall I leave, since such a door there is ?

<p style="text-align:center;">LXVII</p>

Kabir, I was drowning, but the wave of good qualities quickly _washed me ashore_ and saved me ;
When I saw the bark was rotten, I leapt from it at once.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXVIII</p>

Kabir, the saint is not pleasing to the sinner ; the latter cannot bear the worship of God ;
The fly avoideth the sandal, and goeth where there is an evil odour.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXIX</p>

Kabir, the physician is dead, the patient is dead, the whole world is dead in _spiritual_ ignorance ;
One person alone, Kabir, for whom none shall weep is not dead.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXX</p>

Kabir, man meditateth not on God ; such great sin attacheth to him : <span id="p289"><sup><small>[ p. 289 ]</small></sup></span>
The body is a wooden pot ; it cannot be put on the fire a second time. [^36]

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXI</p>

Kabir, it so happened to me that God did what was pleasing to my mind ; [^37]
Why fear death when thou hast taken the red lead [^38] in thy hand ?

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXII</p>

Kabir, as one sucketh sugar-cane, so ought one to strive most earnestly [^39] for virtue :
None calleth that man good who is without virtue.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXIII</p>

Kabir, _the body is like_ an earthen pot filled with water ; it will burst to-day or to-morrow :
If thou remember not thy great _God_, thou shalt be plundered half-way. [^40]

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXIV</p>

Kabir, I am God's dog ; Moti [^41] is my name ;
There is a string [^42] on my neck ; where I am pulled there I go.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXV</p>

Kabir, why displayest thou to men thy wooden rosary ?
If thou remember not God in thy heart, what availeth this rosary ?

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXVI</p>

Kabir, separation from God, like a serpent which yieldeth to no charm, dwelleth in the heart ; <span id="p290"><sup><small>[ p. 290 ]</small></sup></span>
He who is separated from God shall not live, or if he do, he shall become insane. [^43]

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXVII</p>

Kabir, the philosopher's stone and sandal have one good property _in common_ ;
By the touch of the former iron becometh the best _metal_ ; [^44] _by the touch of the latter_ inodorous wood _is perfumed_.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXVIII</p>

Kabir, Death's club is bad ; it cannot be endured :
I have met a holy man [^45] and he hath attached me to his skirt.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXIX</p>

Kabir, the physician, saith, ‘ I am the only good physician ; _all_ medicines are in my power ’ :
This thing _life_ is God's property, He taketh it when He pleaseth.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXX</p>

Kabir, take and beat thy drum for ten days ; [^46]
_This world_ is like the meeting on a river-boat _of persons_ who shall never meet again. [^47]

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXI</p>

Kabir, were I to make the seven oceans my ink, the trees of the forest my pens,
And the earth my paper, I should not _succeed_ in writing God's praises.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXII</p>

Kabir, what harm can my weaver caste do me since God dwelleth in my heart ?
God hath embraced Kabir, and released him from all his entanglements.

<span id="p291"><sup><small>[ p. 291 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXIII</p>

Kabir, there are few willing to burn their own houses, [^48]
Destroy their five children, [^49] and concentrate their love on God.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXIV</p>

Kabir, there are few who will set fire to their own bodies ; [^50]
Fools understand not though Kabir continueth to shout to them.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXV</p>

Kabir, the sati mounted on the pyre crieth out ‘ Hear my friends on this cremation-ground ;
As people have all departed, so do we at last.’

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXVI</p>

Kabir, the mind is a bird which flieth and flieth in every direction ;
Man is rewarded according to the company he keepeth.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXVII</p>

Kabir, the position thou wast seeking thou hast found ;
Thou hast changed into God whom thou thoughtest was different.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXVIII</p>

Kabir, I am dying of evil company like the plantain near the wild caper ;
The latter waveth and the former is pierced _by its thorns_, so avoid the apostate.

<p style="text-align:center;">LXXXIX</p>

Kabir, men [^51] affect to travel with the burden of other men's sins on their heads ;
Why fear they not the burden _of their own_, since the road in front _of them_ is difficult to travel ?

<span id="p292"><sup><small>[ p. 292 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">XC</p>

Kabir, a standing forest tree [^52] which is burning calleth out — 
‘May I not fall into the power of the smith [^53] who would burn me again _in his forge_.’ [^54]

One day Kabir was sitting on the bank of the Ganges. He saw a hunter who had shot a deer. The deer had two young ones in her womb. Both these died. The buck then came, and was also shot by the hunter. The latter went to pick up the animal and was mortally bitten by a snake. The hunter's wife then came and died through grief, or because the snake bit her too. Thus died four males and two females.

<p style="text-align:center;">XCI</p>

Kabir, on the death of one two died ; on the death of two, four ;
On the death of four, six?died — four males and two females. [^55]

<p style="text-align:center;">XCII</p>

Kabir hath seen and searched the world, but found no _abiding_ place anywhere :
Why doth he, who hath not thought of God's name, lose himself in other _speculations_ ?

<p style="text-align:center;">XCIII</p>

Kabir, associate with the saint ; he will save thee at last ;
Associate not with the infidel ; his company will be thy ruin.

<p style="text-align:center;">XCIV</p>

Kabir, knowing that God is everywhere diffused in the world, [^56] I have remembered Him in this life ; <span id="p293"><sup><small>[ p. 293 ]</small></sup></span>
They who have thought not of God's name, have been born in vain.

<p style="text-align:center;">XCV</p>

Kabir, hope in God ; all other hope is hopeless :
They who are bereft of God's name shall admit _its power_ when they fall into hell.

<p style="text-align:center;">XCVI</p>

Kabir hath made many disciples and followers, but hath not made God his friend :
He set out to meet God, but his heart failed him halfway.

<p style="text-align:center;">XCVII</p>

Kabir, what shall poor man do if God assist him not ?
Whatever branch I put my foot on bendeth _beneath me_.

<p style="text-align:center;">XCVIII</p>

Kabir, sand shall fall into the mouths of those _who practise not_ what they preach to others ;
They watch others' property, while their own fields are being eaten up.

<p style="text-align:center;">XCIX</p>

Kabir, associate with holy men even though thou eat only barley bran :
What will be, will be ; associate not with the apostate _even though he give thee better fare_.

<p style="text-align:center;">C</p>

Kabir, by association with the saints the love _of God_ doubleth day by day :
The infidel is like a black blanket ; he becometh not white by washing.

<p style="text-align:center;">CI</p>

Kabir, thou hast not shaved thy heart ; why shave thy hair ?
Man's sins are the work of his heart ; shaving the head is out of place.

<p style="text-align:center;">CII</p>

Kabir, forsake not God ; if thy body and wealth must go, let them go. <span id="p294"><sup><small>[ p. 294 ]</small></sup></span>
They whose hearts are devoted to God's lotus feet, shall be absorbed in His name.

<p style="text-align:center;">CIII</p>

Kabir, the strings of the instrument we play upon are all broken ; [^57]
What can the poor instrument do when the player [^58] hath departed ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CIV</p>

Kabir, shave the mother of that guru from whom doubt departeth not ;
He is drowned himself in the four Veds and he drowneth his disciples therein.

<p style="text-align:center;">CV</p>

Kabir. man concealeth all the sins he committeth ;
But at last they are all disclosed when Dharmraj maketh his inquirv.

<p style="text-align:center;">CVI</p>

Kabir, ceasing to remember God thou hast reared a numerous family :
Thou continuest to practise thine avocations though thy brethren and relations are no more. [^59]

<p style="text-align:center;">CVII</p>

Kabir, the woman who ceasing to remember God goes to awake at night [^60] _to practise witchcraft_,
Shall be born again as a serpent, and eat her own offspring. [^61]

<span id="p295"><sup><small>[ p. 295 ]</small></sup></span>

Kabir, the woman who ceasing to remember God fasteth in honour of Hoi, [^62]
Shall be born again as a donkey and carry a weight of four mans. [^63]

<p style="text-align:center;">CIX</p>

Kabir, very great skill _is required_ to utter God's name in the heart ;
If the acrobat who performeth on the high pole fall, he cannot survive. [^64]

<p style="text-align:center;">CX</p>

Kabir, blest is his mouth who uttereth God's _name_ ;
His _whole_ village shall be blest, _to say nothing_ of the poor _creature_ himself.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXI</p>

Kabir, the family is fortunate in which a slave of God is born ;
The family in which a slave of God is not born shall be _fruitless_ as the _dhak_-tree.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXII</p>

Kabir _hath seen_ hundreds of thousands of horses, elephants, and carriages, and banners wave as thick as clouds —
Begging, when the days pass in remembering God, is better than _all_ this state.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXIII</p>

Kabir, I have traversed the whole world with my drum on my shoulder ;
I have seen and carefully examined [^65] everything, and J find no one hath a friend.

<span id="p296"><sup><small>[ p. 296 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CXIV</p>

Kabir, pearls were scattered on the road ; a blind man came that way _and saw them not_ ;
Without the light of the Lord of the world everybody like the blind man passeth the pearls by.

It is said that Kamal, Kabir's son, met a rich leper who was going in despair to drown himself in the Ganges. Kamal begged him to desist and promised to cure him. Kamal took up some Ganges water in the palm of his hand, breathed on it, repeated the name of God, and then threw the water on the leper. The latter was instantaneously cured. He rewarded Kamal with a large gift of money. In the following couplet Kabir censures his son for having accepted it : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CXV</p>

Kabir's family was ruined when his son Kamal was born ;
Ceasing to remember God he brought home wealth.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXVI</p>

Kabir, go to meet a holy man but take no one with thee ; [^66]
Do not go back ; go on, come what may.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXVII</p>

Bind not thyself, O Kabir, with the rope [^67] by which the world is bound ;
As salt is lost in flour, so shall this gold-like body _disappear_.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXVIII</p>

Kabir, the soul shall fly away and the body be buried ; man knoweth not _when his time shall come_ ; [^68]
Yet even now he will not let covetousness escape from his eyes.

<span id="p297"><sup><small>[ p. 297 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CXIX</p>

Kabir, may I behold Thee, _O God_, with mine eyes, hear Thy name with mine ears,
Utter Thy name with my tongue, and put Thy lotus feet within my heart !

<p style="text-align:center;">cxx</p>

Kabir hath escaped from heaven and hell by the favour of the true guru ;
I bask for ever and ever [^69] in the joy of God's lotus feet.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXI</p>

Kabir, say how can I guess the joy of God's lotus feet ;
Their beauty cannot be described ; it can only be realized when seen.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXII</p>

Kabir, even if I see them, to whom shall I describe them ? no one would be satisfied _with my words_ ;
God is His own parallel ; I dwell in the delight of singing His praises.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXIII</p>

Kabir, the kulang pecketh _its food_ and at the same time remembereth _its young_ ; it pecketh, and pecketh, and pecketh and remembereth _its young_ ;
As its young are dear to the kulang, so is worldly love to the mind.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXIV</p>

Kabir, the sky is overcast with clouds ; lakes and tanks are filled with rain-water ;
_Yet_ what shall be the condition of those who choose to remain thirsty as the chatrik ? [^70]

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXV</p>

Kabir, the sheldrake which at night is separated from her mate, meeteth him in the morning ;
_But_ the man who is separated from God meeteth Him again neither in the mofning nor in the evening.

<span id="p298"><sup><small>[ p. 298 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXVI</p>

Kabir, O shell, remain in the ocean ; if thou leave it, Thou shalt have to scream at sunrise at every temple. [^71]

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXVII</p>

Kabir, what dost thou, O man, by sleeping ? arise and weep through fear _of hell and its_ torments :
How can he whose dwelling is in the grave sleep in peace ? [^72]

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXVIII</p>

Kabir, what dost thou by sleeping ? why not arise and repeat God's _name_ ?
One day thou shalt sleep stretched out at full length _in the grave_.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXIX</p>

Kabir, what dost thou by sleeping ? awake, arise ;
Attach thyself to Him from whom thou art separated.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXX</p>

Kabir, leave not the way of holy men, walk on their road ;
Purify thyself by the sight of them, and repeat God's name on meeting them.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXXI</p>

Kabir, associate not with the infidel ; flee far away _from him_;
If thou touch a black pot, some filth shall attach to thee.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXXII</p>

Kabir, thou hast not thought of God, and old age hath come upon thee ;
When the door of thy house is on fire, what can be taken out and saved ?

<span id="p299"><sup><small>[ p. 299 ]</small></sup></span>

Kabir, the work which the Creator did was accomplished _once for all_.
There is no God _but Him_, the one Creator.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXXIV</p>

Kabir, when the fruit _trees_ begin to bear fruit, and the mango beginneth to ripen,
The fruit reacheth its owner if meantime the crows [^73] have not eaten it.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXXV</p>

Kabir, men purchase and worship an idol, and obstinately go on pilgrimages ;
Like actors they imitate one another, but they only err and lose their way.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXXVI</p>

Kabir, men have turned a stone into God ; everybody worshippeth it ;
They who abide in this belief are drowned in the sable stream.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXXVII</p>

Kabir, _books_ [^74] form a prison, the doors of which are the writing thereon :
Stones [^75] have drowned the world ; pandits have pillaged the road.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXXVIII</p>

Kabir, do now the work of to-morrow ; and if thou do it now, do it at once ;
Nothing can be done hereafter when Death standeth over thy head.

<span id="p300"><sup><small>[ p. 300 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CXXXIX</p>

Kabir, I have seen such and such a person polished like wax ; [^76]
He appeareth quick and very virtuous, but he is without understanding and unholy.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXL</p>

Kabir, Death will not disgrace mine understanding [^77]
Since I have repeated the name of the Cherisher who created him.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLI</p>

Kabir, God is as musk ; all His saints are as the bumblebees _around it_ :
The more Kabir's service, the more God dwelleth _in his heart_.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLII</p>

Kabir, man falleth into the clutches of family ; God is left in the background :
Dharmrafs myrmidons fall on man in the midst of his pomp.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLIII</p>

Kabir, better than an infidel is a pig [^78] which keepeth the village clean ;
When the poor infidel dieth, nobody will mention him.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLIV</p>

Kabir, men have amassed hundreds of thousands and millions, kauri by kauri ;
But when departing they get nothing ; _even_ their waistcloths are taken from them.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLV</p>

Kabir, were one to be a follower of Vishnu and wear a beautiful [^79] necklace, what would it avail him ? <span id="p301"><sup><small>[ p. 301 ]</small></sup></span>
He may be externally gold twelve times purified, but within he is only stuffed with wax.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLVI</p>

Kabir, become the broken stones of the road ; lay aside thine intellectual pride ;
If such a servant there be, he shall meet God.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLVII</p>

Kabir, _but_ what would it avail to be the broken stones ? they would hurt the traveller's feet ;
O God, Thy servant should be as the dust of the earth. [^80]

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLVIII</p>

Kabir, _but_ what would it avail to be dust which fiieth and falleth on men's bodies ?
The servant of God ought to be like water which _cleanseth_ all the limbs. [^81]

<p style="text-align:center;">CXLIX</p>

Kabir, _but_ what would it avail to be water ? it becometh cold or hot _according to the season_ ;
Every servant of God ought to be _perfect_ like God Himself.

<p style="text-align:center;">CL</p>

Flags wave on the tops of lofty mansions _full_ of gold and of women —
Better than all are the bread of alms [^82] and singing God's praises in the company of His saints.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLI</p>

Kabir, the wilderness where God is worshipped is better than a city ;
The place without the beloved God is in my opinion as the city of Death.

<span id="p302"><sup><small>[ p. 302 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CLII</p>

At the ferry of Sahajsun where the Ganges and the Jamna meet, [^83]
Kabir hath built a hut where saints and men _of God_ seek the way.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLIII</p>

Kabir, were man to continue to the end _loving God_ [^84] as he was born,
Millions of precious stones, to say nothing of one poor diamond, would not be equal to him.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLIV</p>

Kabir, I have seen a strange thing — a diamond was sold in a shop ;
In the absence of a purchaser _who knew its worth_, it went for a kauri. [^85]

<p style="text-align:center;">CLV</p>

Kabir, where there is divine knowledge there is virtue ; where there is falsehood there is sin ;
Where there is covetousness there is death ; where there is forgiveness there is _God_ Himself.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLVI</p>

Kabir, what availeth it to abandon worldly love if pride be not _also_ abandoned ?
Munis and their spiritual superiors perished by pride ; their pride ate them all up.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLVII</p>

Kabir, a true guru met me and shot one word at me ;
When it struck me I fell to the earth ; there was a hole made in my heart.

<span id="p303"><sup><small>[ p. 303 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CLVIII</p>

Kabir, what can the true guru do if his disciples be at fault?.
Not one word of his impresseth the _spiritually_ blind : it is like blowing into a bamboo.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLIX</p>

Kabir, the lady of a monarch who possesseth horses, elephants, and carriages in abundance,
Is not equal to the female water-carrier of a saint of God.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLX</p>

Q. O Kabir, why revilest thou the king's lady ? Why honourest thou God's handmaiden ?
A . The former parteth her hair with evil intentions ; the latter remembereth God's name.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXI</p>

Kabir, I propped myself up with _God's name_, and steadied myself ; the true guru gave me courage :
I purchased large diamonds on the bank of lake Mansarowar.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXII</p>

Kabir, God is the diamond, God's servant the jeweller who hath taken the gem and set up a shop _for it_ ;
As soon as an assayer is found, the price of the diamond shall be _ascertained_.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXIII</p>

Kabir, as thou rememberest God when occasion requireth, so remember Him always ;
Make thine abode in the immortal city ; God will restore the wealth thou hast lost.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXIV</p>

Kabir, for worship two beings are necessary, one the saint, and the other God—
God who bestoweth salvation, and the saint who causeth us to repeat His name.

<span id="p304"><sup><small>[ p. 304 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXV</p>

Kabir, crowds followed the pandits by the way they went ; The one road to God by which Kabir hath been ascending is difficult.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXVI</p>

Kabir, man acteth out of regard for his family and thus dieth from worldly troubles ;
Who hath family pride when he is placed on the cremationground ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXVII</p>

Kabir, O wretched people, ye shall be ruined through your great regard for _the opinion of_ others ;
Know that the fate of your neighbours shall also be yours.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXVIII</p>

Kabir, good is the meal of alms made of different kinds [^86] of corn ;
I have no claim on any one _for it_ ; great is the country and great its government. [^87]

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXIX</p>

Kabir, heart-burning ariseth from claims ; he who hath no claim is without anxiety ;
He who hath no claim deemeth Indar poor in _comparison with himself_.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXX</p>

Kabir, the lake is filled to the brim, yet few can drink the water ; [^88]
With great good fortune hast thou found it ; drink it in handfuls, Kabir.

<span id="p305"><sup><small>[ p. 305 ]</small></sup></span>

Kabir, as the stars pass away in the morning, so doth this body pass away ;
But the two letters of God's name pass not away ; Kabir holdeth them fast.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXII</p>

Kabir, the house of wood is on fire on all sides ; [^89]
The pandits perish in the fire while the illiterate escape.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXIII</p>

Kabir, dispel doubts, leave the books of _the pandits_ ;
Having searched the Sanskrit books fix thy thoughts on God's feet,

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXIV</p>

Kabir, saints abandon not their saintship, even though they meet millions who are not saints :
Even though sandal be entwined with serpents, it loseth not its coolness. [^90]

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXV</p>

Kabir, the mind becometh cool when it hath obtained the knowledge of God :
The fire which burnetii the world is as water to God's servant. [^91]

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXVI</p>

This world is the Creator's play ; hardly any one understandeth this ;
The Master Himself or the slave at His court [^92] understandeth it.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXVII</p>

Kabir, it is well for me that I felt the fear _of God_ and forgot all else : <span id="p306"><sup><small>[ p. 306 ]</small></sup></span>
From hail I melted into water, and flowing on I blended with the Ocean. [^93]

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXVIII</p>

Kabir, God having collected dust made bodies like a _physician's_ powders —
Spectacles for four days, but after all they are only dust.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXIX</p>

Kabir, all bodies are as the rising and _setting of_ the sun and moon; [^94]
But if they meet not God and the guru, they all turn into dust again.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXX</p>

Where the Fearless One is, there is no fear of others ; where there is fear, there God is not :
Kabir speaketh _thus_ deliberately ; O saints, give me willing ear.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXI</p>

Kabir, they who know naught pass their time in the sleep of peace :
While they who think they know have their fill of trouble.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXII</p>

Kabir, they who are subdued _by worldly love_ utter many cries, but different is the cry of the pir : [^95]
Kabir who was struck on a vulnerable spot [^96] fell where he stood.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXIII</p>

Kabir, slight is the stroke of a lance ; though struck by it man may breathe _for a time_ ;
But he who can endure the stroke of the Word is a guru, [^97] and I am his slave.

<span id="p307"><sup><small>[ p. 307 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXIV</p>

Kabir, why, O Mulla, ascendest thou the minaret ? the Lord is not deaf :
Search within thy heart for Him for whose sake thou callest to prayer.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXV</p>

Why doth the Shaikh who is without resignation, perform a pilgrimage to the Kaaba ?
Kabir, how can God be for him whose heart is not firm _in his faith_ ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXVI</p>

Kabir, offer thy homage to God, by remembering whom trouble shall depart ;
The Lord will be manifest in thy heart, and the fire [^98] which burneth thee shall be extinguished.

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXVII</p>

Kabir, to use force is tyranny though thou call it lawful ;
When thine accounts are called for at _God's_ office, what shall be thy condition ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXVIII</p>

Kabir, an excellent dinner is khichari [^99] _seasoned_ with _sufficient_ salt to make it palatable ;
Who would cut his own throat by _eating_ meat with his bread ? [^100]

<p style="text-align:center;">CLXXXIX</p>

Kabir, know that the guru will have touched thy heart when worldly love and ambition have been effaced ;
Joy and sorrow shall not then affect thee ; thou _shalt become_ God Himself. [^101]

<p style="text-align:center;">cxc</p>

Kabir, there are different ways of saying Ram ; [^102] there is one point to be considered : <span id="p308"><sup><small>[ p. 308 ]</small></sup></span>
He whom everybody calleth Ram was only a mountebank. [^103]

<p style="text-align:center;">CXCI</p>

Kabir, call Him Ram who is omnipresent ; we must discriminate in mentioning the two Rams ;
The one Ram (God) is contained in all things ; the other (Ram Chaudar) is only contained in one thing, himself: [^104]

<p style="text-align:center;">CXCII</p>

Kabir, in the house in which saints are not served God is not served ;
That house is like a cremation-ground, and ghosts dwell therein.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXCIII</p>

Kabir, I have become dumb, insane, deaf,
And lame from the stroke of the true guru's arrow.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXCIV</p>

Kabir, the brave true guru shot an arrow at me ;
On its striking me I fell to the ground with a hole in my heart. [^105]

<p style="text-align:center;">cxcv</p>

Kabir, the pure rain of heaven [^106] hath fallen on barren soil ; <span id="p309"><sup><small>[ p. 309 ]</small></sup></span>
Know that without good association it becometh like the ashes of a furnace ;

<p style="text-align:center;">CXCVI</p>

_But_, Kabir, when the pure rain of heaven meeteth absorbing soil, [^107]
It cannot be removed, however much clever men may worry themselves.

<p style="text-align:center;">CXCVII</p>

Kabir, I was going on a pilgrimage to the Kaaba, and I met God on the way ;
The Lord fell a-quarrelling with me, ‘ Who ordered thee to go to that place ? ’

<p style="text-align:center;">CXCVIII</p>

Kabir, I have often made the pilgrimage to the Kaaba — how many times, O Kabir ?
O my Master, what fault have I committed that Thou wilt not speak to me ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CXCIX</p>

Kabir, when God produceth His record, what shall be the fate of him
Who violently killeth animals and calleth it lawful ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CC</p>

Kabir, to use violence is tyranny ; God will call for thy defence ;
When thine account is produced from His office, thou shalt be beaten on the mouth.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCI</p>

Kabir, to render thine account is easy, if thy heart be pure ;
In that True Court no one shall molest thee. [^108]

<p style="text-align:center;">CCII</p>

_Saith_ Kabir, O duality, in earth and heaven thou art very difficult to destroy ; [^109] <span id="p310"><sup><small>[ p. 310 ]</small></sup></span>
The six religious systems and the eighty-four Sidhs are involved in doubt.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCIII</p>

Kabir, whatever there is in me is not mine ; whatever there is, is Thine, _O God_.
If Thine own property be rendered unto Thee, what doth it cost me ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CCIV</p>

Kabir, by repeating, ‘ Thou, Thou,’ I have become Thou, O God ; I have not remained in myself ;
When the difference between Thee and me was removed, wherever I looked there _wast_ Thou.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCV</p>

Kabir, man meditateth sin and entertaineth delusive hopes ;
None of his desires is satisfied ; he depart eth in despair.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCVI</p>

Kabir, he who remembereth God is happy in this world ;
He whom the Creator protecteth wavereth not either in this world or the next.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCVII</p>

Kabir, I was being pressed like a handful of sesame when the true guru rescued me ;
He came and appeared to me by primal and ancient destiny.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCVIII</p>

Kabir, my days have been spent in evading _payment of my debts to God_ ; interest goeth on increasing ;
I worshipped not God, nor had I my account torn up when Death arrived.

Guru Arjan has here inserted the three following couplets : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CCIX</p>

Kabir, man is a barking dog which runneth after carrion : [^110]
By grace I have obtained the true guru who hath delivered me.

<span id="p311"><sup><small>[ p. 311 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">ccx</p>

Kabir, the earth belongeth to the holy, but thieves have taken possession of it ;
The earth feeleth not their weight ; to them it is clear gain. [^111]

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXI</p>

Kabir, on account of the husk rice is beaten with a mallet ;
So when men sit in bad company, Dharmraj shall call them to account.

Here Kabir's couplets continue : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXII</p>

‘O Namdev, worldly love hath bewitched _thee_,’ said his friend Trilochan ;
‘ Why printest thou chintzes and thinkest not on God ? ’

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXIII</p>

Namdev replied, ‘ Repeat God's name with thy lips, O Trilochan,
‘Perform all thy duties with thy hands and feet, but let thy heart be with God.’

Guru Arjan again interposes : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXIV</p>

O Kabir, no one hath any concern with me nor I with any one ;
I am contained in Him who hath created this world.

Kabir's instructions are resumed : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXV</p>

Kabir, when flour hath fallen into the mud, none of it is saved ;
It is that which is chewed while being ground that availeth. [^112]

<span id="p312"><sup><small>[ p. 312 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXVI</p>

Kabir, man knoweth everything, and yet he knowingly committeth sin ;
What advantage is it to a man to have a lamp in his hand if he fall into a well ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXVII</p>

Kabir, my love is for the Friend ; foolish people try to dissuade me ;
How can it be proper to break with Him to whom belong my life and soul ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXVIII</p>

Kabir, why killest thou thyself on account of houses, and mansions, and their decoration,
When three and a half cubits, or at most three and three quarters, shall be thy lot ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXIX</p>

Kabir, if _God_ do not what I desire, what availeth my desiring it ;
God doeth what He Himself desireth, not what I desire.

The following couplet of Guru Amar Das, is here found : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXX</p>

God produceth anxiety in man, and also freeth him therefrom ;
Nanak, praise Him who taketh care of all.

A couplet of Guru Arjan here follows : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXI</p>

Kabir, man thinketh not of God ; he goeth astray through greed;
He dieth committing sin, and his life is at an end in a moment.

Here Kabir's couplets continue : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXII</p>

Kabir, the body is a frail vessel of only frail metal ; <span id="p313"><sup><small>[ p. 313 ]</small></sup></span>
If thou wish to make it permanent, worship God, otherwise it will perish.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXIII</p>

Kabir, call out the name of God ; sleep not listlessly ;
By calling out night and day God may sometime hear thy cries.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXIV</p>

Kabir, the body is a plantain grove, the heart an elephant maddened by passion, which _breaketh it down_ ;
The jewel of divine knowledge is the goad, and a rare saint the tamer [^113] of the elephant.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXV</p>

Kabir, God's name is a jewel, the mouth a purse to hold it ; open it before him who can appreciate _the jewel_ ;
If any purchaser be found, he may take it at a high price. [^114]

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXVI</p>

Kabir, man knoweth not God's name while bringing up a numerous family ;
He dieth in the midst of his worldly duties, and is not heard of in the outer _world_.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXVII</p>

Kabir, in the twinkling of an eye and in a moment life passeth away ;
Since the mind freeth not itself from entanglements, Death beateth his drum, _and leadeth away his victim in triumph_.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXVIII</p>

Kabir, God is as a tree, abandonment of the world as its fruit;
The saint who hath abandoned bootless discussions [^115] as its shade.

<span id="p314"><sup><small>[ p. 314 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXIX</p>

Kabir, plant the seed of such _a tree_ as shall bear perennial fruit,
_Whose_ shade shall be cool, whose fruit shall be profuse, and on which birds [^116] shall play.

<p style="text-align:center;">ccxxx</p>

Kabir, the Giver is a tree whose fruit is mercy _which sheddeth_ favours on men ;
When the birds which it sheltereth migrate, [^117] they say ‘ O Tree, mayest thou be fruitful ! ’

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXI</p>

Kabir, association with saints is obtained by destiny ;
By such association the boon of salvation is obtained, and the difficult road _to God_ not obstructed.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXII</p>

Kabir, even for a ghari, half a ghari, or half that again,
Converse held with the saints is clear gain.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXIII</p>

Kabir, the mortals who eat bhang and fish [^118] and drink wine,
Shall all go to hell, whatever pilgrimages, fastings, and daily devotion they may perform.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXIV</p>

Kabir, if I cast down mine eyes and take the Friend into my heart,
I enjoy every pleasure with my Beloved, and I disclose this to no one.

The fifth Guru here interposes : —

<span id="p315"><sup><small>[ p. 315 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXV</p>

For the eight watches, the sixty-four _gharis_ of the day, my soul looketh towards Thee, O God.
Why cast down mine eyes since I behold the Beloved in every heart ?

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXVI</p>

Hear, my companions, either my soul dwelleth in my Beloved or my Beloved in my soul.
I know not whether my soul is in my heart, or my Beloved dwelleth in my soul.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXVII</p>

Kabir, the Brahman is the guru of the world, but he is not the guru of the saints ;
He killeth himself over the perplexities of the four Veds.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXVIII</p>

God is as sugar scattered in the sand, but the elephant cannot pick it up ;
Saith Kabir, the guru gave this excellent advice, ‘ Become an ant and eat it.’ [^119]

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXXXIX</p>

Kabir, if thou desire the Beloved, cut off thy head and make it into a ball ; [^120]
While playing attain such a state of _ecstasy_ that _thou shalt be satisfied_ with whatever happeneth thee.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXL</p>

Kabir, if thou desire the Beloved, play with a true guru ;
If unripe oil-seeds be pressed, neither oil-cake nor oil will be obtained. [^121]

Here a couplet of Namdev is introduced : —

<span id="p316"><sup><small>[ p. 316 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXLI</p>

Man searching for God stumbleth like a blind man and recognizeth not the saint ;
Saith Namdev, how shalt thou obtain God without the mediation of His saints ?

The following lines of Rav Das are here inserted : —

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXLII</p>

He . who forsaking God the diamond year-net h for other gods,
Shall go to hell, verily saith Rav Das.

<p style="text-align:center;">CCXLIII</p>

O Kabir, if thou embrace a domestic life, act honestly ; otherwise abandon the world ;
But if any one, having abandoned the world, _again_ become entangled _with it_, great indeed shall be his misfortune.

## Notes

[^1]: This is understood to be a satire on Indian bankers who generally wear large earrings.

[^2]: That is, who practise humility and efface their pride.

[^3]: Also translated— On the day my pride is dead there shall be rejoicing.

[^4]: The _Butea Frondosa_.

[^5]: It holds its head high, yet it is hollow in the centre.

[^6]: They who are hardened in their pride are not improved by association with the humble.

[^7]: Who has to undergo transmigration.

[^8]: _Maya_ here means body, because it is the result of illusion.

[^9]: Put into the churn in India in the hot weather to assist the churning process.

[^10]: Who breaks into the heart, and robs it of its virtues.

[^11]: Others translate— Kabir hath cut her up in twelve pieces.

[^12]: Kabir chased her to arrest her, but she ran in every direction, literally, by twelve ways to avoid hirn, and so she cannot rob him.

[^13]: Literally — Open not the knots of thy dress in which it is tied.

[^14]: Some understand this line to mean — Whether thou adoptest a worldly or an ascetic life. Sanyasis or hermits shave their heads.

[^15]: Let not thy human birth go in vain.

[^16]: That thou shalt have no more transmigration.

[^17]: Of sin is meant.

[^18]: This was written after witnessing a cremation.

[^19]: Thou mayest be brought low thyself, and men will laugh at thee.

[^20]: In the original, none, but this apparently is an exaggeration of religious enthusiasm.

[^21]: This slok is an allegory. By son Kabir meant soul, and by daughter body. Is there any one who will devote his soul and body to God's worship? Another explanation is the following — Is there any one who will give me his son— his heart— in exchange for my daughter, religious instruction.

[^22]: The pleasures thou hast enjoyed are useless to thee now.

[^23]: That is, what care I for their reviling?

[^24]: Death has attacked man's body.

[^25]: The soul.

[^26]: The little water and the little pond mean the world. The ocean is God from whom man emanated, and with whom he ought to seek refuge from the angler's net, that is, death.

[^27]: Forsake not God's service even though it be attended with hardship.

[^28]: If thou have recourse to the gods and goddesses of the vulgar.

[^29]: Also translated — make humility thy religion.

[^30]: Man is like a hungry stag let loose on the grassy margin of a lake. He revels in the rich pasture afforded him, has no time for other reflection, and consequently becomes an easy prey to Death the hunter.

[^31]: Also translated — Saying this, Kabir departed from Banaras for Magahar.

[^32]: Also translated — Kabir, God followeth those whose minds are pure as Ganges water, and saith that they are superior to it.

[^33]: Turmeric and lime stand for men of different castes. Turmeric means men of low castes, lime men of high castes. High caste men were originally fair in comparison with the brown aborigines of India. When turmeric and lime are blended, a red product used for sacrificial marks on the forehead results. When holy men of different castes meet, God is obtained by their association, and their castes disappear.

[^34]: Man is very proud.

[^35]: This slok has already been given in the life of Kabir.

[^36]: Human birth shall not be again obtained by those who meditate not on God.

[^37]: God admitted me to His service.

[^38]: That is, why fear death which is imminent and unavoidable ?

[^39]: Literally — to weep and die in one's efforts to obtain it.

[^40]: All the good works you l^ave performed shall only help you halfway ; but, if you have meditated on God, you shall be saved.

[^41]: Moti — literally pearl— is a common Indian name for a favourite dog.

[^42]: God's love.

[^43]: The serpent shall sting him, and he shall either die or become insane.

[^44]: Gold.

[^45]: Ramanand.

[^46]: Be happy while you may.

[^47]: Compare — The world 's a city full of straying streets, And death the market-place where each one meets.

[^48]: To mortify their flesh.

[^49]: The five evil passions as dear to men as their children.

[^50]: To subdue their concupiscence.

[^51]: The Brahmans.

[^52]: The body.

[^53]: The god of death.

[^54]: That is, subject me to transmigration after the miseries of this life.

[^55]: This enigmatical couplet is thus explained— On the death of spiritual ignorance, superstition and attachment to worldly things die. When these two evils die, then die lust, anger, worldly love, and covetousness. When these four deadly sins die, then die birth and death (jointly called transmigration), joy, grief, hope, and desire. The first four are feminine, the last two are masculine.

[^56]: That is, not in the temple, or the mosque, or in any other place especially set apart for religious worship.

[^57]: The body has grown old, and its limbs have become useless.

[^58]: Life.

[^59]: That is, thou wilt not take warning by the fate of others.

[^60]: After the cremation of a corpse and before the bones are collected strangers go to the burning-place at night, and practise incantations with the object of retaining the ghost of the departed so as to be serviceable to them in their worldly objects. When the relatives of the departed know of the ceremony, they do not allow it.

[^61]: It is supposed that a female snake draws a circle round her eggs and then breaks them herself. The young snakes which can go outside the circle are allowed to depart and live, but those not so able the mother is said to eat.

[^62]: Hoi is a representation of the goddess of small-pox. A festival is held by women in her honour in the month of Kartik, eight days before the Diwali. Unmarried women make clay images of her with the object of obtaining their desires. These images are thrown into water after the Diwali. In the Panjab Hoi is known as Sanjhi.

[^64]: If man, having once entered the path of devotion deflect from it, he shall find no abiding place.

[^65]: _Thok bajana_ is to clink a vessel with the middle finger to test its soundness.

[^66]: That is, do not wait for a companion? It may also mean—take not with you a companion who may want you to change your mind, and turn back on the way.

[^67]: Worldly love.

[^68]: Also translated— He expresses his wishes to his relations by signs.

[^69]: Literally — in the beginning and the end.

[^70]: Those who accept not the teaching of holy men which is as plentiful as rain.

[^71]: That is, O man, remain absorbed in the contemplation of God, otherwise thou shalt have to undergo many births. At Hindu temples it is a custom to blow shells in the morning to summon worshippers.

[^72]: Unless we have repented before death.

[^73]: If the evil passions of men do not mar their good works, they shall reach God. _Kanh_ is also an insect which destroys fruit. The meaning of the slok is — Man may perform penance and many acts of worship, but all will be unavailing if there be a flaw, in his devotion, if his heart be not right.

[^74]: The writings in which idolatry and pilgrimages are prescribed.

[^75]: Idol worship.

[^82]: _Madhukari_. This word is derived from the Sanskrit madhuhar, the bee which extracts honey from every flower.

[^83]: The gyanis generally translate this — In the sukhmana where the breath of the left and right nostrils meet.

[^84]: The belief is that the foetus in the womb prays to God, but when a child is born and brought into contact with the world, his devotion fails.

[^85]: Divine grace so priceless was spurned by the common herd, and only valued at a kauri.

[^86]: And thus affording variety.

[^87]: That is, the world is wide, and great is the empire of the holy. The words _dawa kahu ko nahin_ are also translated — To which no one hath a claim.

[^88]: The saints are filled with holiness, yet few accept instruction from them, The verse is also translated — The lake is full, but there is a dike in front owing to which few can drink the water. The dike means worldly love, which hinders men from having recourse to the guru.

[^89]: That is, evil passions assail the body.

[^90]: As poisonous serpents have no effect on sandal- wood, so the evil do not corrupt the holy.

[^91]: The evil passions which inflame mankind produce no impression on him.

[^92]: Diwani may also mean divine enthusiast deemed mad -by the world.

[^93]: Kabir's heart was at first cold and hard as hail. When the fire of divine love shone on it, it melted into water, which, flowing on, blended with the ocean of God.

[^94]: Animals bodies are born and die.

[^95]: Also translated— Many cry out that they arc struck by God's love, but the pain _they exhibit_ tells a different story. The word pir has two meanings : (a) a priest or saint ; (b) pain.

[^103]: Although in some of their hymns Kabir and some of the other Bhagats of the Granth Sahib appear to have believed in the Hindu incarnations, they occasionally ridiculed them.

[^104]: Some Sikhs translate this and the preceding slok as follows
  CXC
  Kabir, there are different ways of uttering Ram; in this there is an important point.
  _People_ in general utter Ram one way, and the saints another way.
  CXCI
  Kabir, utter Ram, Ram, but use discrimination in uttering it.
  Some _while doing so_ are engaged in their various pursuits while others are absorbed in the one God.

[^105]: That is y the- guru's exhortation made an impression on my heart.

[^106]: The true guru's instruction.

[^107]: When the guru's instruction is communicated to men capable of receiving it.

[^108]: Literally — catch thee by the coat.
