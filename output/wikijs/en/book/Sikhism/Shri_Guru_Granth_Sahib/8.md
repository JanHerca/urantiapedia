## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 001

One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, First House, So Dar ~ That Gate:
What is that Gate, and what is that Home, in which You sit and take care of all?
Countless musical instruments of so many various kinds vibrate there for You; so many are the musicians there for You.
There are so many Ragas there for You, along with their accompanying harmonies; so many minstrels sing to You.
The winds sing to You, as do water and fire; the Righteous Judge of Dharma sings at Your Door.
Chitar and Gupat, the recording angels of the conscious and the subconscious, sing to You; they know, and they write, and on the basis of what they write, the Lord of Dharma passes judgement.
Shiva and Brahma and the Goddess Parvaati, so beautiful and ever adorned by You, sing to You.
The Indras, seated upon their celestial thrones, with the deities at Your Gate, sing to You.
The Siddhas in Samaadhi sing to You, and the Holy Saints, in their contemplative meditation, sing to You.
The celibates, the truthful and the patient beings sing to You, and the mighty warriors sing to You.
The scholarly Pandits sing to You, along with the holy Rishis and the readers of the Vedas throughout the ages.
The Mohinis, the heavenly beauties who entice the heart in paradise, in this world and in the nether regions, sing to You.
The fourteen priceless jewels created by You, and the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, sing to You.
The mighty warriors and the divine heroes sing to You, and the four sources of creation sing to You.
The continents, the worlds and the solar systems, created and installed by Your Hand, sing to You.
They alone sing to You, who are pleasing to Your Will, and who are imbued with the nectar of Your devotional worship.
So many others sing to You, they do not come into my mind; how can Nanak think of them?
That Lord and Master - He is True, forever True; He is True, and True is His Name.
He who created the creation is True, and He shall always be True; He shall not depart, even when the creation departs.
He created the world of Maya with its various colors and species.
Having created the creation, He Himself watches over it, as it pleases His Greatness.
Whatever pleases Him, that is what He does. No one can issue any commands to Him.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 002

He is the King, the King of Kings, the Emperor of Kings! Nanak lives in surrender to His Will. ||1||1||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
That Lord is Immaculate; the Lord God is Immaculate. The Lord is Unapproachable, Unfathomable and Incomparable.
All meditate, all meditate on You, O Dear Lord, O True Creator.
All beings are Yours; You are the Giver of all beings.
So meditate on the Lord, O Saints; He is the One who takes away all pain.
The Lord Himself is the Master, and He Himself is His own servant. O Nanak, how insignificant are mortal beings! ||1||
You are totally pervading within each and every heart; O Lord, You are the One Primal Being, All-permeating.
Some are givers, and some are beggars; all of this is Your wondrous play!
You Yourself are the Giver, and You Yourself are the Enjoyer. I know of no other than You.
You are the Supreme Lord God, Infinite and Eternal; what Glorious Praises of Yours should I speak and chant?
Unto those who serve, unto those who serve You, slave Nanak is a sacrifice. ||2||
Those who meditate on the Lord, those who meditate on You, O Dear Lord, those humble beings dwell in peace in this world.
They are liberated, they are liberated, who meditate on the Lord; the noose of Death is cut away from them.
Those who meditate on the Fearless One, on the Fearless Lord, all their fears are dispelled.
Those who have served, those who have served my Dear Lord, are absorbed into the Being of the Lord, Har, Har.
Blessed are they, blessed are they, who have meditated on the Dear Lord; slave Nanak is a sacrifice to them. ||3||
Devotion to You, devotion to You, is a treasure, overflowing, infinite and endless.
Your devotees, Your devotees praise You, O Dear Lord, in many and various ways.
For You, so many, for You, so very many, O Dear Lord, perform worship and adoration; they practice penance and endlessly chant in meditation.
For You, many - for You, so very many read the various Simritees and Shaastras; they perform religious rituals and the six ceremonies.
Those devotees, those devotees are good, O servant Nanak, who are pleasing to my Lord God. ||4||
You are the Primal Being, the Unrivalled Creator Lord; there is no other as Great as You.
You are the One, age after age; forever and ever, You are One and the same. You are the Eternal, Unchanging Creator.
Whatever pleases You comes to pass. Whatever You Yourself do, happens.
You Yourself created the entire Universe, and having done so, You Yourself shall destroy it all.
Servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Creator, the Knower of all. ||5||2||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Chaupaday, Second House:
Hearing, everyone calls You Great,
but only one who has seen You, knows just how Great You are.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 003

No one can measure Your Worth, or describe You.
Those who describe You, remain absorbed in You. ||1||
O my Great Lord and Master of Unfathomable Depth, You are the Ocean of Excellence.
No one knows the greatness of Your expanse. ||1||Pause||
All the contemplators met together and practiced contemplation;
all the appraisers met together and tried to appraise You.
The theologians, the meditators and the teachers of teachers
could not express even an iota of Your Greatness. ||2||
All Truth, all austerities, all goodness,
and the greatness of the Siddhas, the beings of perfect spiritual powers
\- without You, none has attained such spiritual powers.
They are obtained by Your Grace; their flow cannot be blocked. ||3||
What can the helpless speaker do?
Your bounties are overflowing with Your Praises.
And the one, unto whom You give - why should he think of any other?
O Nanak, the True Lord is the Embellisher. ||4||1||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Chanting the Name, I live; forgetting it, I die.
It is so difficult to chant the True Name.
If someone feels hunger for the True Name,
then that hunger shall consume his pains. ||1||
So how could I ever forget Him, O my Mother?
True is the Master, and True is His Name. ||1||Pause||
People have grown weary of trying to appraise the greatness of the True Name, but they have not been able to appraise even an iota of it.
Even if they were all to meet together and recount them,
You would not be made any greater or lesser. ||2||
He does not die - there is no reason to mourn.
He continues to give, but His Provisions are never exhausted.
This Glorious Virtue is His alone - no one else is like Him;
there has never been anyone like Him, and there never shall be. ||3||
As Great as You Yourself are, so Great are Your Gifts.
It is You who created day and night as well.
Those who forget their Lord and Master are vile and despicable.
O Nanak, without the Name, people are wretched outcasts. ||4||2||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
If a beggar cries out at the door, the Master hears it in His Mansion.
Whether He receives him or pushes him away, it is the Gift of the Lord's Greatness. ||1||
Recognize the Lord's Light within all, and do not consider social class or status; there are no classes or castes in the world hereafter. ||1||Pause||
He Himself acts, and He Himself inspires us to act.
He Himself considers our complaints.
Since You, O Creator Lord, are the Doer,
why should I submit to the world? ||2||
You Yourself created and You Yourself give.
You Yourself eliminate evil-mindedness;
by Guru's Grace, You come to abide in our minds,
and then, pain and darkness are dispelled from within. ||3||
He Himself infuses love for the Truth.
Unto others, the Truth is not bestowed.
If He bestows it upon someone, says Nanak, then, in the world hereafter, that person is not called to account. ||4||3||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The urges of the heart are like cymbals and ankle-bells;
the drum of the world resounds with the beat.
Naarad dances to the tune of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga;
where can the celibates and the men of truth place their feet? ||1||
Nanak is a sacrifice to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The world is blind; our Lord and Master is All-seeing. ||1||Pause||
The disciple feeds on the Guru;
out of love for bread, he comes to dwell in his home.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 004

If one were to live and eat for hundreds of years,
that day alone would be auspicious, when he recognizes his Lord and Master. ||2||
Beholding the sight of the petitioner, compassion is not aroused.
No one lives without give and take.
The king administers justice only if his palm is greased.
No one is moved by the Name of God. ||3||
O Nanak, they are human beings in form and name only;
by their deeds they are dogs - this is the Command of the Lord's Court.
By Guru's Grace, if one sees himself as a guest in this world,
then he gains honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||4||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
As much as the Shabad is in the mind, so much is Your melody; as much as the form of the universe is, so much is Your body, Lord.
You Yourself are the tongue, and You Yourself are the nose. Do not speak of any other, O my mother. ||1||
My Lord and Master is One;
He is the One and Only; O Siblings of Destiny, He is the One alone. ||1||Pause||
He Himself kills, and He Himself emancipates; He Himself gives and takes.
He Himself beholds, and He Himself rejoices; He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace. ||2||
Whatever He is to do, that is what He is doing. No one else can do anything.
As He projects Himself, so do we describe Him; this is all Your Glorious Greatness, Lord. ||3||
The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the bottle of wine; Maya is the sweet wine, and the intoxicated mind continues to drink it in.
He Himself assumes all sorts of forms; thus poor Nanak speaks. ||4||5||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Make your intellect your instrument, and love your tambourine;
thus bliss and lasting pleasure shall be produced in your mind.
This is devotional worship, and this is the practice of penance.
So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||1||
Know that the perfect beat is the Praise of the Lord;
other dances produce only temporary pleasure in the mind. ||1||Pause||
Play the two cymbals of truth and contentment.
Let your ankle bells be the lasting Vision of the Lord.
Let your harmony and music be the elimination of duality.
So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||2||
Let the fear of God within your heart and mind be your spinning dance,
and keep up, whether sitting or standing.
To roll around in the dust is to know that the body is only ashes.
So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||3||
Keep the company of the disciples, the students who love the teachings.
As Gurmukh, listen to the True Name.
O Nanak, chant it, over and over again.
So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||4||6||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
He created the air, and He supports the whole world; he bound water and fire together.
The blind, ten-headed Raavan had his heads cut off, but what greatness was obtained by killing him? ||1||
What Glories of Yours can be chanted?
You are totally pervading everywhere; You love and cherish all. ||1||Pause||
You created all beings, and You hold the world in Your Hands; what greatness is it to put a ring in the nose of the black cobra, as Krishna did?
Whose Husband are You? Who is Your wife? You are subtly diffused and pervading in all. ||2||
Brahma, the bestower of blessings, entered the stem of the lotus, with his relatives, to find the extent of the universe.
Proceeding on, he could not find its limits; what glory was obtained by killing Kansa, the king? ||3||
The jewels were produced and brought forth by churning the ocean of milk. The other gods proclaimed “We are the ones who did this!”

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 005

Says Nanak, by hiding, how can the Lord be hidden? He has given each their share, one by one. ||4||7||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The vine of good actions and character has spread out, and it bears the fruit of the Lord's Name.
The Name has no form or outline; it vibrates with the unstruck Sound Current; through the Word of the Shabad, the Immaculate Lord is revealed. ||1||
One can speak on this only when he knows it.
He alone drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
Those who drink it in are enraptured; their bonds and shackles are cut away.
When one's light blends into the Divine Light, then the desire for Maya is ended. ||2||
Among all lights, I behold Your Form; all the worlds are Your Maya.
Among the tumults and forms, He sits in serene detachment; He bestows His Glance of Grace upon those who are engrossed in the illusion. ||3||
The Yogi who plays on the instrument of the Shabad gains the Blessed Vision of the Infinitely Beautiful Lord.
He, the Lord, is immersed in the Unstruck Shabad of the Word, says Nanak, the humble and meek. ||4||8||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
My virtue is that I carry the load of my words upon my head.
The real words are the Words of the Creator Lord.
How useless are eating, drinking and laughing,
if the Lord is not cherished in the heart! ||1||
Why should someone care for anything else,
if throughout his life, he gathers in that which is truly worth gathering? ||1||Pause||
The intellect of the mind is like a drunken elephant.
Whatever one utters is totally false, the most false of the false.
So what face should we put on to offer our prayer,
when both virtue and vice are close at hand as witnesses? ||2||
As You make us, so we become.
Without You, there is no other at all.
As is the understanding which You bestow, so do we receive.
As it pleases Your Will, so do You lead us. ||3||
The divine crystalline harmonies, their consorts, and their celestial families
\- from them, the essence of Ambrosial Nectar is produced.
O Nanak, this is the wealth and property of the Creator Lord.
If only this essential reality were understood! ||4||9||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
When by His Grace He came to my home, then my companions met together to celebrate my marriage.
Beholding this play, my mind became blissful; my Husband Lord has come to marry me. ||1||
So sing - yes, sing the songs of wisdom and reflection, O brides.
My spouse, the Life of the world, has come into my home. ||1||Pause||
When I was married within the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, I met my Husband Lord, and I came to know Him.
The Word of His Shabad is pervading the three worlds; when my ego was quieted, my mind became happy. ||2||
He Himself arranges His own affairs; His affairs cannot be arranged by anyone else.
By the affair of this marriage, truth, contentment, mercy and faith are produced; but how rare is that Gurmukh who understands it! ||3||
Says Nanak, that Lord alone is the Husband of all.
She, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace, becomes the happy soul-bride. ||4||10||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Home and forest are the same, for one who dwells in the balance of intuitive peace and poise.
His evil-mindedness departs, and the Praises of God take its place.
To chant the True Name with one's mouth is the true ladder.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 006

Serving the True Guru, one finds one's own place within the self. ||1||
To conquer the mind is the knowledge of the six Shaastras.
The Divine Light of the Lord God is perfectly pervading. ||1||Pause||
Excessive thirst for Maya makes people wear all sorts of religious robes.
The pain of corruption destroys the body's peace.
Sexual desire and anger steal the wealth of the self within.
But by abandoning duality, one is emancipated through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
In the Lord's Praise and adoration is intuitive peace, poise and bliss.
The Love of the Lord God is one's family and friends.
He Himself is the Doer, and He Himself is the Forgiver.
My body and mind belong to the Lord; my life is at His Command. ||3||
Falsehood and corruption cause terrible suffering.
All the religious robes and social classes look just like dust.
Whoever is born, continues to come and go.
O Nanak, only the Naam and the Lord's Command are eternal and everlasting. ||4||11||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
In the pool is the one incomparably beautiful lotus.
It blossoms continually; its form is pure and fragrant.
The swans pick up the bright jewels.
They take on the essence of the All-powerful Lord of the Universe. ||1||
Whoever is seen, is subject to birth and death.
In the pool without water, the lotus is not seen. ||1||Pause||
How rare are those who know and understand this secret.
The Vedas continually speak of the three branches.
One who merges into the knowledge of the Lord as absolute and related,
serves the True Guru and obtains the supreme status. ||2||
One who is imbued with the Love of the Lord and dwells continually upon Him is liberated.
He is the king of kings, and blossoms forth continually.
That one whom You preserve, by bestowing Your Mercy, O Lord,
even the sinking stone - You float that one across. ||3||
Your Light is pervading the three worlds; I know that You are permeating the three worlds.
When my mind turned away from Maya, I came to dwell in my own home.
Nanak falls at the feet of that person who immerses himself in the Lord's Love, and performs devotional worship night and day. ||4||12||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Receiving the True Teachings from the Guru, arguments depart.
But through excessive cleverness, one is only plastered with dirt.
The filth of attachment is removed by the True Name of the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, one remains lovingly attached to the Lord. ||1||
He is the Presence Ever-present; offer your prayers to Him.
Pain and pleasure are in the Hands of God, the True Creator. ||1||Pause||
One who practices falsehood comes and goes.
By speaking and talking, His limits cannot be found.
Whatever one sees, is not understood.
Without the Name, satisfaction does not enter into the mind. ||2||
Whoever is born is afflicted by disease,
tortured by the pain of egotism and Maya.
They alone are saved, who are protected by God.
Serving the True Guru, they drink in the Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||
The unstable mind is restrained by tasting this Nectar.
Serving the True Guru, one comes to cherish the Ambrosial Nectar of the Shabad.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, the state of liberation is obtained.
O Nanak, self-conceit is eradicated from within. ||4||13||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Whatever He has done, has proved to be true.
The True Guru bestows the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.
With the Naam in the heart, the mind is not separated from the Lord.
Night and day, one dwells with the Beloved. ||1||
O Lord, please keep me in the Protection of Your Sanctuary.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 007

By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the sublime essence of the Lord; I have received the wealth of the Naam and the nine treasures. ||1||Pause||
Those whose karma and Dharma - whose actions and faith - are in the True Name of the True Lord
\- I am forever a sacrifice to them.
Those who are imbued with the Lord are accepted and respected.
In their company, the supreme wealth is obtained. ||2||
Blessed is that bride, who has obtained the Lord as her Husband.
She is imbued with the Lord, and she reflects upon the Word of His Shabad.
She saves herself, and saves her family and friends as well.
She serves the True Guru, and contemplates the essence of reality. ||3||
The True Name is my social status and honor.
The love of the Truth is my karma and Dharma - my faith and my actions, and my self-control.
O Nanak, one who is forgiven by the Lord is not called to account.
The One Lord erases duality. ||4||14||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Some come, and after they come, they go.
Some are imbued with the Lord; they remain absorbed in Him.
Some find no place of rest at all, on the earth or in the sky.
Those who do not meditate on the Name of the Lord are the most unfortunate. ||1||
From the Perfect Guru, the way to salvation is obtained.
This world is a terrifying ocean of poison; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord helps us cross over. ||1||Pause||
Those, whom God unites with Himself,
cannot be crushed by death.
The beloved Gurmukhs remain immaculately pure,
like the lotus in the water, which remains untouched. ||2||
Tell me: who should we call good or bad?
Behold the Lord God; the truth is revealed to the Gurmukh.
I speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord, contemplating the Guru's Teachings.
I join the Sangat, the Guru's Congregation, and I find God's limits. ||3||
The Shaastras, the Vedas, the Simritees and all their many secrets;
bathing at the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage - all this is found by enshrining the sublime essence of the Lord in the heart.
The Gurmukhs are immaculately pure; no filth sticks to them.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides in the heart, by the greatest pre-ordained destiny. ||4||15||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Bowing down, again and again, I fall at the Feet of my Guru; through Him, I have seen the Lord, the Divine Self, within.
Through contemplation and meditation, the Lord dwells within the heart; see this, and understand. ||1||
So speak the Lord's Name, which shall emancipate you.
By Guru's Grace, the jewel of the Lord is found; ignorance is dispelled, and the Divine Light shines forth. ||1||Pause||
By merely saying it with the tongue, one's bonds are not broken, and egotism and doubt do not depart from within.
But when one meets the True Guru, egotism departs, and then, one realizes his destiny. ||2||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is sweet and dear to His devotees; it is the ocean of peace - enshrine it within the heart.
The Lover of His devotees, the Life of the World, the Lord bestows the Guru's Teachings upon the intellect, and one is emancipated. ||3||
One who dies fighting against his own stubborn mind finds God, and the desires of the mind are quieted.
O Nanak, if the Life of the World bestows His Mercy, one is intuitively attuned to the Love of the Lord. ||4||16||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Unto whom do they speak? Unto whom do they preach? Who understands? Let them understand themselves.
Who do they teach? Through study, they come to realize the Lord's Glorious Virtues. Through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, they come to dwell in contentment. ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 008

Through the Guru's Teachings, realize that He is pervading in all bodies;
O my soul, vibrate on the Profound, Unfathomable Lord. ||1||Pause||
Loving devotion to the Lord brings endless waves of joy and delight.
One who dwells with the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day, is sanctified.
The birth into the world of the faithless cynic is totally useless.
The humble devotee of the Lord remains unattached. ||2||
The body which sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord is sanctified.
The soul remains conscious of the Lord, absorbed in His Love.
The Lord is the Infinite Primal Being, beyond the beyond, the priceless jewel.
My mind is totally content, imbued with my Beloved. ||3||
Those who speak and babble on and on, are truly dead.
God is not far away - O God, You are right here.
I have seen that the whole world is engrossed in Maya.
O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||17||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Ti-Tukas:
One is a beggar, living on charity;
another is a king, absorbed in himself.
One receives honor, and another dishonor.
The Lord destroys and creates; He is enshrined in His meditation.
There is no other as great as You.
So whom should I present to You? Who is good enough? ||1||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my only Support.
You are the Great Giver, the Doer, the Creator. ||1||Pause||
I have not walked on Your Path; I have followed the crooked path.
In the Court of the Lord, I find no place to sit.
I am mentally blind, in the bondage of Maya.
The wall of my body is breaking down, wearing away, growing weaker.
You have such high hopes of eating and living
\- your breaths and morsels of food are already counted! ||2||
Night and day they are blind - please, bless them with Your Light.
They are drowning in the terrifying world-ocean, crying out in pain.
I am a sacrifice to those who chant, hear and believe in the Name.
Nanak utters this one prayer;
soul and body, all belong to You, Lord. ||3||
When You bless me, I chant Your Name.
Thus I find my seat in the Court of the Lord.
When it pleases You, evil-mindedness departs,
and the jewel of spiritual wisdom comes to dwell in the mind.
When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then one comes to meet the True Guru.
Prays Nanak, carry us across the terrifying world-ocean. ||4||18||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Panch-Padas:
A cow without milk; a bird without wings; a garden without water - totally useless!
What is an emperor, without respect? The chamber of the soul is so dark, without the Name of the Lord. ||1||
How could I ever forget You? It would be so painful!
I would suffer such pain - no, I shall not forget You! ||1||Pause||
The eyes grow blind, the tongue does not taste, and the ears do not hear any sound.
He walks on his feet only when supported by someone else; without serving the Lord, such are the fruits of life. ||2||
The Word is the tree; the garden of the heart is the farm; tend it, and irrigate it with the Lord's Love.
All these trees bear the fruit of the Name of the One Lord; but without the karma of good actions, how can anyone obtain it? ||3||
As many living beings are there are, they are all Yours. Without selfless service, no one obtains any reward.
Pain and pleasure come by Your Will; without the Name, the soul does not even exist. ||4||
To die in the Teachings is to live. Otherwise, what is life? That is not the way.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 009

Says Nanak, He grants life to the living beings; O Lord, please keep me according to Your Will. ||5||19||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Let the body be the Brahmin, and let the mind be the loin-cloth;
let spiritual wisdom be the sacred thread, and meditation the ceremonial ring.
I seek the Name of the Lord and His Praise as my cleansing bath.
By Guru's Grace, I am absorbed into God. ||1||
O Pandit, O religious scholar, contemplate God in such a way
that His Name may sanctify you, that His Name may be your study, and His Name your wisdom and way of life. ||1||Pause||
The outer sacred thread is worthwhile only as long as the Divine Light is within.
So make the remembrance of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, your loin-cloth and the ceremonial mark on your forehead.
Here and hereafter, the Name alone shall stand by you.
Do not seek any other actions, except the Name. ||2||
Worship the Lord in loving adoration, and burn your desire for Maya.
Behold only the One Lord, and do not seek out any other.
Become aware of reality, in the Sky of the Tenth Gate;
read aloud the Lord's Word, and contemplate it. ||3||
With the diet of His Love, doubt and fear depart.
With the Lord as your night watchman, no thief will dare to break in.
Let the knowledge of the One God be the ceremonial mark on your forehead.
Let the realization that God is within you be your discrimination. ||4||
Through ritual actions, God cannot be won over;
by reciting sacred scriptures, His value cannot be estimated.
The eighteen Puraanas and the four Vedas do not know His mystery.
O Nanak, the True Guru has shown me the Lord God. ||5||20||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
He alone is the selfless servant, slave and humble devotee,
who as Gurmukh, becomes the slave of his Lord and Master.
He, who created the Universe, shall ultimately destroy it.
Without Him, there is no other at all. ||1||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Gurmukh reflects upon the True Name; in the True Court, he is found to be true. ||1||Pause||
The true supplication, the true prayer
\- within the Mansion of His Sublime Presence, the True Lord Master hears and applauds these.
He summons the truthful to His Heavenly Throne
and bestows glorious greatness upon them; that which He wills, comes to pass. ||2||
The Power is Yours; You are my only Support.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is my true password.
One who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, goes to Him openly.
With the password of truth, his way is not blocked. ||3||
The Pandit reads and expounds on the Vedas,
but he does not know the secret of the thing within himself.
Without the Guru, understanding and realization are not obtained;
but still God is True, pervading everywhere. ||4||
What should I say, or speak or describe?
Only You Yourself know, O Lord of total wonder.
Nanak takes the Support of the Door of the One God.
There, at the True Door, the Gurmukhs sustain themselves. ||5||21||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The clay pitcher of the body is miserable; it suffers in pain through birth and death.
How can this terrifying world-ocean be crossed over? Without the Lord - Guru, it cannot be crossed. ||1||
Without You, there is no other at all, O my Beloved; without you, there is no other at all.
You are in all colors and forms; he alone is forgiven, upon whom You bestow Your Glance of Grace. ||1||Pause||
Maya, my mother-in-law, is evil; she does not let me live in my own home. The vicious one does not let me meet with my Husband Lord.
I serve at the feet of my companions and friends; the Lord has showered me with His Mercy, through Guru's Grace. ||2||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 010

Reflecting upon my self, and conquering my mind, I have seen that there is no other friend like You.
As You keep me, so do I live. You are the Giver of peace and pleasure. Whatever You do, comes to pass. ||3||
Hope and desire have both been dispelled; I have renounced my longing for the three qualities.
The Gurmukh obtains the state of ecstasy, taking to the Shelter of the Saints' Congregation. ||4||
All wisdom and meditation, all chanting and penance, come to one whose heart is filled with the Invisible, Inscrutable Lord.
O Nanak, one whose mind is imbued with the Lord's Name, finds the Guru's Teachings, and intuitively serves. ||5||22||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Panch-Padas:
Your attachment to your family, your attachment to all your affairs
\- renounce all your attachments, for they are all corrupt. ||1||
Renounce your attachments and doubts, O brother,
and dwell upon the True Name within your heart and body. ||1||Pause||
When one receives the nine treasures of the True Name,
his children do not weep, and his mother does not grieve. ||2||
In this attachment, the world is drowning.
Few are the Gurmukhs who swim across. ||3||
In this attachment, people are reincarnated over and over again.
Attached to emotional attachment, they go to the city of Death. ||4||
You have received the Guru's Teachings - now practice meditation and penance.
If attachment is not broken, no one is approved. ||5||
But if He bestows His Glance of Grace, then this attachment departs.
O Nanak, then one remains merged in the Lord. ||6||23||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
He Himself does everything, the True, Invisible, Infinite Lord.
I am a sinner, You are the Forgiver. ||1||
By Your Will, everything come to pass.
One who acts in stubborn-mindedness is ruined in the end. ||1||Pause||
The intellect of the self-willed manmukh is engrossed in falsehood.
Without the meditative remembrance of the Lord, it suffers in sin. ||2||
Renounce evil-mindedness, and you shall reap the rewards.
Whoever is born, comes through the Unknowable and Mysterious Lord. ||3||
Such is my Friend and Companion;
meeting with the Guru, the Lord, devotion was implanted within me. ||4||
In all other transactions, one suffers loss.
The Name of the Lord is pleasing to Nanak's mind. ||5||24||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Chau-Padas:
Contemplate and reflect upon knowledge, and you will become a benefactor to others.
When you conquer the five passions, then you shall come to dwell at the sacred shrine of pilgrimage. ||1||
You shall hear the vibrations of the tinkling bells, when your mind is held steady.
So what can the Messenger of Death do to me hereafter? ||1||Pause||
When you abandon hope and desire, then you become a true Sannyaasi.
When the Yogi practices abstinence, then he enjoys his body. ||2||
Through compassion, the naked hermit reflects upon his inner self.
He slays his own self, instead of slaying others. ||3||
You, O Lord, are the One, but You have so many Forms.
Nanak does not know Your wondrous plays. ||4||25||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
I am not stained by only one sin, that could be washed clean by virtue.
My Husband Lord is awake, while I sleep through the entire night of my life. ||1||
In this way, how can I become dear to my Husband Lord?
My Husband Lord remains awake, while I sleep through the entire night of my life. ||1||Pause||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 011

With hope and desire, I approach His Bed,
but I do not know whether He will be pleased with me or not. ||2||
How do I know what will happen to me, O my mother?
Without the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, I cannot survive. ||1||Pause||
I have not tasted His Love, and my thirst is not quenched.
My beautiful youth has run away, and now I, the soul-bride, repent and regret. ||3||
Even now, I am held by hope and desire.
I am depressed; I have no hope at all. ||1||Pause||
She overcomes her egotism, and adorns herself;
the Husband Lord now ravishes and enjoys the soul-bride on His Bed. ||4||
Then, O Nanak, the bride becomes pleasing to the Mind of her Husband Lord;
she sheds her self-conceit, and is absorbed in her Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||26||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
In this world of my father's house, I, the soul-bride, have been very childish;
I did not realize the value of my Husband Lord. ||1||
My Husband is the One; there is no other like Him.
If He bestows His Glance of Grace, then I shall meet Him. ||1||Pause||
In the next world of my in-law's house, I, the the soul-bride, shall realize Truth;
I shall come to know the celestial peace of my Husband Lord. ||2||
By Guru's Grace, such wisdom comes to me,
so that the soul-bride becomes pleasing to the Mind of the Husband Lord. ||3||
Says Nanak, she who adorns herself with the Love and the Fear of God,
enjoys her Husband Lord forever on His Bed. ||4||27||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
No one is anyone else's son, and no one is anyone else's mother.
Through false attachments, people wander around in doubt. ||1||
O My Lord and Master, I am created by You.
If You give it to me, I will chant Your Name. ||1||Pause||
That person who is filled with all sorts of sins may pray at the Lord's Door,
but he is forgiven only when the Lord so wills. ||2||
By Guru's Grace, evil-mindedness is destroyed.
Wherever I look, there I find the One Lord. ||3||
Says Nanak, if one comes to such an understanding,
then he is absorbed into the Truest of the True. ||4||28||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Du-Padas:
In that pool of the world, the people have their homes; there, the Lord has created water and fire.
In the mud of earthly attachment, their feet have become mired, and I have seen them drowning there. ||1||
O foolish people, why don't you remember the One Lord?
Forgetting the Lord, your virtues shall wither away. ||1||Pause||
I am not a celibate, nor am I truthful, nor a scholar; I was born foolish and ignorant.
Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who do not forget You, Lord. ||2||29||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
There are six systems of philosophy, six teachers, and six doctrines;
but the Teacher of teachers is the One Lord, who appears in so many forms. ||1||
That system, where the Praises of the Creator are sung
\- follow that system; in it rests greatness. ||1||Pause||
As the seconds, minutes, hours, days, weekdays months and seasons all originate from the one sun,
O Nanak, so do all forms originate from the One Creator. ||2||30||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 012

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, Third House, First Mehl:
You may have thousands of armies, thousands of marching bands and lances, and thousands of men to rise and salute you.
Your rule may extend over thousands of miles, and thousands of men may rise to honor you.
But, if your honor is of no account to the Lord, then all of your ostentatious show is useless. ||1||
Without the Name of the Lord, the world is in turmoil.
Even though the fool may be taught again and again, he remains the blindest of the blind. ||1||Pause||
You may earn thousands, collect thousands, and spend thousands of dollars; thousands may come, and thousands may go.
But, if your honor is of no account to the Lord, then where will you go to find a safe haven? ||2||
Thousands of Shaastras may be explained to the mortal, and thousands of Pandits may read the Puraanas to him;
but, if his honor is of no account to the Lord, then all of this is unacceptable. ||3||
Honor comes from the True Name, the Name of the Merciful Creator.
If it abides in the heart, day and night, O Nanak, then the mortal shall swim across, by His Grace. ||4||1||31||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The One Name is my lamp; I have put the oil of suffering into it.
Its flame has dried up this oil, and I have escaped my meeting with the Messenger of Death. ||1||
O people, do not make fun of me.
Thousands of wooden logs, piled up together, need only a tiny flame to burn. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is my festive dish, of rice balls on leafy plates; the True Name of the Creator Lord is my funeral ceremony.
Here and hereafter, in the past and in the future, this is my support. ||2||
The Lord's Praise is my River Ganges and my city of Benares; my soul takes its sacred cleansing bath there.
That becomes my true cleansing bath, if night and day, I enshrine love for You. ||3||
The rice balls are offered to the gods and the dead ancestors, but it is the Brahmins who eat them!
O Nanak, the rice balls of the Lord are a gift which is never exhausted. ||4||2||32||
Aasaa, Fourth House, First Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Gods, yearning for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, suffered through pain and hunger at the sacred shrines.
The yogis and the celibates live their disciplined lifestyle, while others wear saffron robes and become hermits. ||1||
For Your sake, O Lord Master, they are imbued with love.
Your Names are so many, and Your Forms are endless. No one can tell how may Glorious Virtues You have. ||1||Pause||
Leaving behind hearth and home, palaces, elephants, horses and native lands, mortals have journeyed to foreign lands.
The spiritual leaders, prophets, seers and men of faith renounced the world, and became acceptable. ||2||
Renouncing tasty delicacies, comfort, happiness and pleasures, some have abandoned their clothes and now wear skins.
Those who suffer in pain, imbued with Your Name, have become beggars at Your Door. ||3||
Some wear skins, and carry begging bowls, bearing wooden staffs, and sitting on deer skins. Others raise their hair in tufts and wear sacred threads and loin-cloths.
You are the Lord Master, I am just Your puppet. Prays Nanak, what is my social status to be? ||4||1||33||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 013

Aasaa, Fifth House, First Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The five evil passions dwell hidden within the mind.
They do not remain still, but move around like wanderers. ||1||
My soul does not stay held by the Merciful Lord.
It is greedy, deceitful, sinful and hypocritical, and totally attached to Maya. ||1||Pause||
I will decorate my neck with garlands of flowers.
When I meet my Beloved, then I will put on my decorations. ||2||
I have five companions and one Spouse.
It is ordained from the very beginning, that the soul must ultimately depart. ||3||
The five companions will lament together.
When the soul is trapped, prays Nanak, it is called to account. ||4||1||34||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, Sixth House, First Mehl:
If the pearl of the mind is strung like a jewel on the thread of the breath,
and the soul-bride adorns her body with compassion, then the Beloved Lord will enjoy His lovely bride. ||1||
O my Love, I am fascinated by Your many glories;
Your Glorious Virtues are not found in any other. ||1||Pause||
If the bride wears the garland of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, around her neck, and if she uses the toothbrush of the Lord;
and if she fashions and wears the bracelet of the Creator Lord around her wrist, then she shall hold her consciousness steady. ||2||
She should make the Lord, the Slayer of demons, her ring, and take the Transcendent Lord as her silken clothes.
The soul-bride should weave patience into the braids of her hair, and apply the lotion of the Lord, the Great Lover. ||3||
If she lights the lamp in the mansion of her mind, and makes her body the bed of the Lord,
then, when the King of spiritual wisdom comes to her bed, He shall take her, and enjoy her. ||4||1||35||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The created being acts as he is made to act; what can be said to him, O Siblings of Destiny?
Whatever the Lord is to do, He is doing; what cleverness could be used to affect Him? ||1||
The Order of Your Will is so sweet, O Lord; this is pleasing to You.
O Nanak, he alone is honored with greatness, who is absorbed in the True Name. ||1||Pause||
The deeds are done according to pre-ordained destiny; no one can turn back this Order.
As it is written, so it comes to pass; no one can erase it. ||2||
He who talks on and on in the Lord's Court is known as a joker.
He is not successful in the game of chess, and his chessmen do not reach their goal. ||3||
By himself, no one is literate, learned or wise; no one is ignorant or evil.
When, as a slave, one praises the Lord, only then is he known as a human being. ||4||2||36||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Let the Word of the Guru's Shabad be the ear-rings in your mind, and wear the patched coat of tolerance.
Whatever the Lord does, look upon that as good; thus you shall obtain the treasure of Sehj Yoga. ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 014

O father, the soul which is united in union as a Yogi, remains united in the supreme essence throughout the ages.
One who has obtained the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Immaculate Lord - his body enjoys the pleasure of spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||
In the Lord's City, he sits in his Yogic posture, and he forsakes his desires and conflicts.
The sound of the horn ever rings out its beautiful melody, and day and night, he is filled with the sound current of the Naad. ||2||
My cup is reflective meditation, and spiritual wisdom is my walking stick; to dwell in the Lord's Presence is the ashes I apply to my body.
The Praise of the Lord is my occupation; and to live as Gurmukh is my pure religion. ||3||
My arm-rest is to see the Lord's Light in all, although their forms and colors are so numerous.
Says Nanak, listen, O Bharthari Yogi: love only the Supreme Lord God. ||4||3||37||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Make spiritual wisdom your molasses, and meditation your scented flowers; let good deeds be the herbs.
Let devotional faith be the distilling fire, and your love the ceramic cup. Thus the sweet nectar of life is distilled. ||1||
O Baba, the mind is intoxicated with the Naam, drinking in its Nectar. It remains absorbed in the Lord's Love.
Night and day, remaining attached to the Love of the Lord, the celestial music of the Shabad resounds. ||1||Pause||
The Perfect Lord naturally gives the cup of Truth, to the one upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace.
One who trades in this Nectar - how could he ever love the wine of the world? ||2||
The Teachings of the Guru, the Ambrosial Bani - drinking them in, one becomes acceptable and renowned.
Unto the one who loves the Lord's Court, and the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, of what use is liberation or paradise? ||3||
Imbued with the Lord's Praises, one is forever a Bairaagee, a renunciate, and one's life is not lost in the gamble.
Says Nanak, listen, O Bharthari Yogi: drink in the intoxicating nectar of the Lord. ||4||4||38||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Having attacked Khuraasaan, Baabar terrified Hindustan.
The Creator Himself does not take the blame, but has sent the Mugal as the messenger of death.
There was so much slaughter that the people screamed. Didn't You feel compassion, Lord? ||1||
O Creator Lord, You are the Master of all.
If some powerful man strikes out against another man, then no one feels any grief in their mind. ||1||Pause||
But if a powerful tiger attacks a flock of sheep and kills them, then its master must answer for it.
This priceless country has been laid waste and defiled by dogs, and no one pays any attention to the dead.
You Yourself unite, and You Yourself separate; I gaze upon Your Glorious Greatness. ||2||
One may give himself a great name, and revel in the pleasures of the mind,
but in the Eyes of the Lord and Master, he is just a worm, for all the corn that he eats.
Only one who dies to his ego while yet alive, obtains the blessings, O Nanak, by chanting the Lord's Name. ||3||5||39||
Raag Aasaa, Second House, Third Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan is obtained by great good fortune.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, true detachment is obtained.
The six systems of philosophy are pervasive,

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 015

but the Guru's system is profound and unequalled. ||1||
The Guru's system is the way to liberation.
The True Lord Himself comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||Pause||
Through the Guru's system, the world is saved,
if it is embraced with love and affection.
How rare is that person who truly loves the Guru's Way.
Through the Guru's system, everlasting peace is obtained. ||2||
Through the Guru's system, the Door of Salvation is obtained.
Serving the True Guru, one's family is saved.
There is no salvation for those who have no Guru.
Beguiled by worthless sins, they are struck down. ||3||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the body finds peace and tranquility.
The Gurmukh is not afflicted by pain.
The Messenger of Death does not come near him.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is absorbed in the True Lord. ||4||1||40||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, eradicates his self-conceit from within.
He serves the True Guru, with no iota of self-interest.
The Fearless Lord, the Great Giver, ever abides in his mind.
The True Bani of the Word is obtained only by good destiny. ||1||
So gather merits, and let your demerits depart from within you.
You shall be absorbed into the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
One who purchases merits, knows the value of these merits.
He chants the Ambrosial Nectar of the Word, and the Name of the Lord.
Through the True Bani of the Word, he becomes pure.
Through merit, the Name is obtained. ||2||
The invaluable merits cannot be acquired.
The pure mind is absorbed into the True Word of the Shabad.
How very fortunate are those who meditate on the Naam,
and ever enshrine in their minds the Lord, the Giver of merit. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to those who gather merits.
At the Gate of Truth, I sing the Glorious Praises of the True One.
He Himself spontaneously bestows His gifts.
O Nanak, the value of the Lord cannot be described. ||4||2||41||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Great is the greatness of the True Guru;
He merges in His Merger, those who have been separated for so long.
He Himself merges the merged in His Merger.
He Himself knows His own worth. ||1||
How can anyone appraise the Lord's worth?
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one may merge with the Infinite, Unapproachable and Incomprehensible Lord. ||1||Pause||
Few are the Gurmukhs who know His worth.
How rare are those who receive the Lord's Grace.
Through the Sublime Bani of His Word, one becomes sublime.
The Gurmukh chants the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
Without the Name, the body suffers in pain;
but when one meets the True Guru, then that pain is removed.
Without meeting the Guru, the mortal earns only pain.
The self-willed manmukh receives only more punishment. ||3||
The essence of the Lord's Name is so very sweet;
he alone drinks it, whom the Lord causes to drink it.
By Guru's Grace, the essence of the Lord is obtained.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, salvation is attained. ||4||3||42||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
My God is True, deep and profound.
Serving Him, the body acquires peace and tranquility.
Through the Word of the Shabad, His humble servants easily swim across.
I fall at their feet forever and ever. ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 016

Those being whose minds are imbued and drenched with the Lord's Love
\- their pains of birth and death are taken away. They are automatically ushered into the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
One who has tasted the Shabad, obtains the true flavor.
The Name of the Lord abides within his mind.
The Lord God is Eternal and All-pervading.
He Himself is near, and He Himself is far away. ||2||
Everyone talks and speaks through speech;
the Lord Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself.
By merely speaking and talking, He is not obtained.
By Guru's Grace, He comes to abide in the mind. ||3||
The Gurmukh eradicates his self-conceit from within.
He is imbued with the Lord's Love, having discarded worldly attachment.
He contemplates the utterly Immaculate Word of the Guru's Shabad.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is our Salvation. ||4||4||43||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Attached to the love of duality, one only incurs pain.
Without the Word of the Shabad, one's life is wasted away in vain.
Serving the True Guru, understanding is obtained,
and then, one is not attached to the love of duality. ||1||
Those who hold fast to their roots, become acceptable.
Night and day, they meditate within their hearts on the Lord's Name; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they know the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
One who is attached to the branch, does not receive the fruits.
For blind actions, blind punishment is received.
The blind, self-willed manmukh finds no place of rest.
He is a maggot in manure, and in manure he shall rot away. ||2||
Serving the Guru, everlasting peace is obtained.
Joining the True Congregation, the Sat Sangat, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung.
One who contemplates the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
saves himself, and his family as well. ||3||
Through the Word of the Guru's Bani, the Naam resounds;
O Nanak, through the Word of the Shabad, one finds the Mansion of the Lord's Presence within the home of the heart.
Under Guru's Instruction, bathe in the Pool of Truth, in the Water of the Lord;
thus the filth of evil-mindedness and sin shall all be washed away. ||4||5||44||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs are dying; they are wasting away in death.
In the love of duality, they murder their own souls.
Crying out, “Mine, mine!”, they are ruined.
They do not remember their souls; they are asleep in superstition. ||1||
He alone dies a real death, who dies in the Word of the Shabad.
The Guru has inspired me to realize, that praise and slander are one and the same; in this world, the profit is obtained by chanting the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are dissolved within the womb.
Useless is the birth of those who are lured by duality.
Without the Naam, all are burning in pain.
The Perfect True Guru has given me this understanding. ||2||
The fickle mind is struck down so many times.
Having lost this opportunity, no place of rest shall be found.
Cast into the womb of reincarnation, the mortal lives in manure;
in such a home, the self-willed manmukh takes up residence. ||3||
I am forever a sacrifice to my True Guru;
the light of the Gurmukh blends with the Divine Light of the Lord.
Through the Immaculate Bani of the Word, the mortal dwells within the home of his own inner self.
O Nanak, he conquers his ego, and remains forever detached. ||4||6||45||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The Lord's slave sets aside his own social status.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 017

He dedicates his mind and body to the True Guru, and seeks His Sanctuary.
His greatest greatness is that the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is in his heart.
The Beloved Lord God is his constant companion. ||1||
He alone is the Lord's slave, who remains dead while yet alive.
He looks upon pleasure and pain alike; by Guru's Grace, he is saved through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
He does his deeds according to the Lord's Primal Command.
Without the Shabad, no one is approved.
Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, the Naam abides within the mind.
He Himself gives His gifts, without hesitation. ||2||
The self-willed manmukh wanders around the world in doubt.
Without any capital, he makes false transactions.
Without any capital, he does not obtain any merchandise.
The mistaken manmukh wastes away his life. ||3||
One who serves the True Guru is the Lord's slave.
His social status is exalted, and his reputation is exalted.
Climbing the Guru's Ladder, he becomes the most exalted of all.
O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, greatness is obtained. ||4||7||46||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh practices falsehood, only falsehood.
He never attains the Mansion of the Lord Presence.
Attached to duality, he wanders, deluded by doubt.
Entangled in worldly attachments, he comes and goes. ||1||
Behold, the decorations of the discarded bride!
Her consciousness is attached to children, spouse, wealth, and Maya, falsehood, emotional attachment, hypocrisy and corruption. ||1||Pause||
She who is pleasing to God is forever a happy soul-bride.
She makes the Word of the Guru's Shabad her decoration.
Her bed is so comfortable; she enjoys her Lord, night and day.
Meeting her Beloved, the obtains eternal peace. ||2||
She is a true, virtuous soul-bride, who enshrines love for the True Lord.
She keeps her Husband Lord always clasped to her heart.
She sees Him near at hand, ever-present.
My God is all-pervading everywhere. ||3||
Social status and beauty will not go with you hereafter.
As are the deeds done here, so does one become.
Through the Word of the Shabad, one becomes the highest of the high.
O Nanak, he is absorbed in the True Lord. ||4||8||47||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The Lord's humble servant is imbued with devotional love, effortlessly and spontaneously.
Through awe and fear of the Guru, he is truly absorbed in the True One.
Without the Perfect Guru, devotional love is not obtained.
The self-willed manmukhs lose their honor, and cry out in pain. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Lord's Name, and meditate on Him forever.
You shall always be in ecstasy, day and night, and you shall obtain the fruits of your desires. ||1||Pause||
Through the Perfect Guru, the Perfect Lord is obtained,
and the Shabad, the True Name, is enshrined in the mind.
One who bathes in the Pool of Ambrosial Nectar becomes immaculately pure within.
He becomes forever sanctified, and is absorbed in the True Lord. ||2||
He sees the Lord God ever-present.
By Guru's Grace, he sees the Lord permeating and pervading everywhere.
Wherever I go, there I see Him.
Without the Guru, there is no other Giver. ||3||
The Guru is the ocean, the perfect treasure,
the most precious jewel and priceless ruby.
By Guru's Grace, the Great Giver blesses us;
O Nanak, the Forgiving Lord forgives us. ||4||9||48||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The Guru is the Ocean; the True Guru is the Embodiment of Truth.
Through perfect good destiny, one serves the Guru.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 018

He alone understands, whom the Lord Himself inspires to understand.
By Guru's Grace, one serves Him. ||1||
With the jewel of spiritual wisdom, total understanding is obtained.
By Guru's Grace, ignorance is dispelled; one then remains wakeful, night and day, and beholds the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, attachment and pride are burnt away.
From the Perfect Guru, true understanding is obtained.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one realizes the Lord's Presence within.
Then, one's coming and going cease, and one becomes stable, absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
The world is tied to birth and death.
The unconscious, self-willed manmukh is enveloped in the darkness of Maya and emotional attachment.
He slanders others, and practices utter falsehood.
He is a maggot in manure, and into manure he is absorbed. ||3||
Joining the True Congregation, the Sat Sangat, total understanding is obtained.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, devotional love for the Lord is implanted.
One who surrenders to the Lord's Will is peaceful forever.
O Nanak, he is absorbed into the True Lord. ||4||10||49||
Aasaa, Third Mehl, Panch-Padas:
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, finds eternal bliss.
He is united with the True Guru, the Guru, the Lord God.
He does not die any more, and he does not come or go.
Through the Perfect Guru, he merges with the True Lord. ||1||
One who has the Naam, the Name of the Lord, written in his pre-ordained destiny,
night and day, meditates forever on the Naam; he obtains the wondrous blessing of devotional love from the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
Those, whom the Lord God has blended with Himself
\- their sublime state cannot be described.
The Perfect True Guru has given the Glorious Greatness,
of the most exalted order, and I am absorbed into the Lord's Name. ||2||
Whatever the Lord does, He does all by Himself.
In an instant, He establishes, and disestablishes.
By merely speaking, talking, shouting and preaching about the Lord, even hundreds of times, the mortal is not approved. ||3||
The Guru meets with those, who take virtue as their treasure;
they listen to the True Word of the Guru's Bani, the Shabad.
Pain departs, from that place where the Shabad abides.
By the jewel of spiritual wisdom, one is easily absorbed into the True Lord. ||4||
No other wealth is as great as the Naam.
It is bestowed only by the True Lord.
Through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, it abides in the mind.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, peace is obtained. ||5||11||50||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
One may dance and play numerous instruments;
but this mind is blind and deaf, so for whose benefit is this speaking and preaching?
Deep within is the fire of greed, and the dust-storm of doubt.
The lamp of knowledge is not burning, and understanding is not obtained. ||1||
The Gurmukh has the light of devotional worship within his heart.
Understanding his own self, he meets God. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukh's dance is to embrace love for the Lord;
to the beat of the drum, he sheds his ego from within.
My God is True; He Himself is the Knower of all.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, recognize the Creator Lord within yourself. ||2||
The Gurmukh is filled with devotional love for the Beloved Lord.
He intuitively reflects upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
For the Gurmukh, loving devotional worship is the way to the True Lord.
But the dances and the worship of the hypocrites bring only pain. ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 019

True Devotion is to remain dead while yet alive.
By Guru's Grace, one crosses over the terrible world-ocean.
Through the Guru's Teachings, one's devotion is accepted,
and then, the Dear Lord Himself comes to dwell in the mind. ||4||
When the Lord bestows His Mercy, He leads us to meet the True Guru.
Then, one's devotion becomes steady, and the consciousness is centered upon the Lord.
Those who are imbued with Devotion have truthful reputations.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, peace is obtained. ||5||12||51||
Aasaa, Eighth House, Kaafee, Third Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
By the Pleasure of the Lord's Will, one meets the True Guru, and true understanding is obtained.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord abides in the mind, and one comes to understand the Lord. ||1||
My Husband Lord, the Great Giver, is One. There is no other at all.
By Guru's merciful favor, He abides in the mind, and then, a lasting peace ensues. ||1||Pause||
In this age, the Lord's Name is fearless; it is obtained by meditative reflection upon the Guru.
Without the Name, the blind, foolish, self-willed manmukh is under Death's power. ||2||
By the Pleasure of the Lord's Will, the humble being performs His service, and understands the True Lord.
By the Pleasure of the Lord's Will, He is to be praised; surrendering to His Will, peace ensues. ||3||
By the Pleasure of the Lord's Will, the prize of this human birth is obtained, and the intellect is exalted.
O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh, you shall be emancipated. ||4||39||13||52||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You are the True Creator, my Lord Master.
That which is pleasing to Your Will, comes to pass. Whatever You give, that is what I receive. ||1||Pause||
All are Yours; all meditate on You.
He alone, whom You bless with Your Mercy, obtains the jewel of the Naam.
The Gurmukhs obtain it, and the self-willed manmukhs lose it.
You Yourself separate the mortals, and You Yourself unite them. ||1||
You are the River - all are within You.
Other than You, there is no one at all.
All beings and creatures are your play-things.
The united ones are separated, and the separated ones are re-united. ||2||
That humble being, whom You inspire to understand, understands;
he continually speaks and chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
One who serves the Lord, obtains peace.
He is easily absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||3||
You Yourself are the Creator; by Your doing, all things come to be.
Without You, there is no other at all.
You watch over the creation, and understand it.
O servant Nanak, the Lord is revealed to the Gurmukh. ||4||1||53||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 020

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Second House, Fourth Mehl:
Some form alliances with friends, children and siblings.
Some form alliances with in-laws and relatives.
Some form alliances with chiefs and leaders for their own selfish motives.
My alliance is with the Lord, who is pervading everywhere. ||1||
I have formed my alliance with the Lord; the Lord is my only support.
Other than the Lord, I have no other faction or alliance; I sing of the countless and endless Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those with whom you form alliances, shall perish.
Making false alliances, the mortals repent and regret in the end.
Those who practice falsehood shall not last.
I have formed my alliance with the Lord; there is no one more powerful than Him. ||2||
All these alliances are mere extensions of the love of Maya.
Only fools argue over Maya.
They are born, and they die, and they lose the game of life in the gamble.
My alliance is with the Lord, who embellishes all, in this world and the next. ||3||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the five thieves instigate alliances and conflicts.
Sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and self-conceit have increased.
One who is blessed by the Lord's Grace, joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
My alliance is with the Lord, who has destroyed all these alliances. ||4||
In the false love of duality, people sit and form alliances.
They complain about other peoples' faults, while their own self-conceit only increases.
As they plant, so shall they harvest.
Servant Nanak has joined the Lord's alliance of Dharma, which shall conquer the whole world. ||5||2||54||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
Constantly listening to the Ambrosial Gurbani in the heart, it becomes pleasing to the mind.
Through Gurbani, the Incomprehensible Lord is comprehended. ||1||
As Gurmukh, listen to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O my sisters.
The One Lord is pervading and permeating deep within the heart; with your mouth, recite the Ambrosial Hymns of the Guru. ||1||Pause||
My mind and body are filled with divine love, and great sadness.
By great good fortune, I have obtained the True Guru, the Primal Being. ||2||
In the love of duality, the mortals wander through poisonous Maya.
The unfortunate ones do not meet the True Guru. ||3||
The Lord Himself inspires us to drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Elixir.
Through the Perfect Guru, O Nanak, the Lord is obtained. ||4||3||55||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
The Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of my mind and body.
I chant the Naam; the Naam is the essence of peace. ||1||
So chant the Naam, O my friends and companions.
Without the Naam, there is nothing else for me. By great good fortune, as Gurmukh, I have received the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
Without the Naam, I cannot live.
By great good fortune, the Gurmukhs obtain the Naam. ||2||
Those who lack the Naam have their faces rubbed in the dirt of Maya.
Without the Naam, cursed, cursed are their lives. ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 021

The Great Lord is obtained by great good destiny.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is blessed with the Naam. ||4||4||56||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
I sing His Glorious Praises, and through the Word of His Bani, I speak His Glorious Praises.
As Gurmukh, I chant and recite the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
Chanting and meditating on the Naam, my mind becomes blissful.
The True Guru has implanted the True Name of the True Lord within me; I sing His Glorious Praises, and taste the supreme ecstasy. ||1||Pause||
The humble servants of the Lord sing the Lord's Glorious Praises.
By great good fortune, the detached, absolute Lord is obtained. ||2||
Those without virtue are stained by Maya's filth.
Lacking virtue, the egotistical die, and suffer reincarnation. ||3||
The ocean of the body yields pearls of virtue.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh churns this ocean, and discovers this essence. ||4||5||57||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
I listen to the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Naam is pleasing to my mind.
By great good fortune, the Gurmukh obtains the Lord. ||1||
Chant the Naam, as Gurmukh, and be exalted.
Without the Naam, I have no other support; the Naam is woven into all my breaths and morsels of food. ||1||Pause||
The Naam illuminates my mind; listening to it, my mind is pleased.
One who speaks the Naam - he alone is my friend and companion. ||2||
Without the Naam, the fools depart naked.
They burn away to death, chasing the poison of Maya, like the moth chasing the flame. ||3||
He Himself establishes, and, having established, disestablishes.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself bestows the Naam. ||4||6||58||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
The vine of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, has taken root in the Gurmukh.
It bears the fruit of the Lord; its taste is so tasty! ||1||
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in endless waves of joy.
Chant and repeat the Naam; through the Guru's Teachings praise the Lord, and slay the horrible serpent of the Messenger of Death. ||1||Pause||
The Lord has implanted His devotional worship in the Guru.
When the Guru is pleased, He bestows it upon His Sikh, O my siblings of Destiny. ||2||
One who acts in ego, knows nothing about the Way.
He acts like an elephant, who takes a bath, and then throws dust on his head. ||3||
If one's destiny is great and exalted,
O Nanak, one chants the Naam, the Name of the Immaculate, True Lord. ||4||7||59||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
My mind suffers hunger for the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Hearing the Naam, my mind is satisfied, O my Siblings of Destiny. ||1||
Chant the Naam, O my friends, O GurSikhs.
Chant the Naam, and through the Naam, obtain peace; through the Guru's Teachings, enshrine the Naam in your heart and mind. ||1||Pause||
Hearing the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind is in bliss.
Reaping the profit of the Naam, through the Guru's Teachings, my soul has blossomed forth. ||2||
Without the Naam, the mortal is a leper, blinded by emotional attachment.
All his actions are fruitless; they lead only to painful entanglements. ||3||
The very fortunate ones chant the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, one embraces love for the Naam. ||4||8||60||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 022

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Fourth Mehl, Raag Aasaa, 3 Of Sixth House :
You may pluck the strings with your hand, O Yogi, but your playing of the harp is in vain.
Under Guru's Instruction, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Yogi, and this mind of yours shall be imbued with the Lord's Love. ||1||
O Yogi, give your intellect the Teachings of the Lord.
The Lord, the One Lord, is pervading throughout all the ages; I humbly bow down to Him. ||1||Pause||
You sing in so many Ragas and harmonies, and you talk so much, but this mind of yours is only playing a game.
You work the well and irrigate the fields, but the oxen have already left to graze in the jungle. ||2||
In the field of the body, plant the Lord's Name, and the Lord will sprout there, like a lush green field.
O mortal, hook up your unstable mind like an ox, and irrigate your fields with the Lord's Name, through the Guru's Teachings. ||3||
The Yogis, the wandering Jangams, and all the world is Yours, O Lord. According to the wisdom which You give them, so do they follow their ways.
O Lord God of servant Nanak, O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts, please link my mind to You. ||4||9||61||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
How long must one search for angle bells and cymbals, and how long must one play the guitar?
In the brief instant between coming and going, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Such is the devotional love which has been produced in my mind.
Without the Lord, I cannot live even for an instant, like the fish which dies without water. ||1||Pause||
How long must one tune the five strings, and assemble the seven singers, and how long will they raise their voices in song?
In the time it takes to select and assemble these musicians, a moment elapses, and my mind sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
How long must one dance and stretch out one's feet, and how long must one reach out with one's hands?
Stretching out one's hands and feet, there is a moment's delay; and then, my mind meditates on the Lord. ||3||
How long must one satisfy the people, in order to obtain honor?
O servant Nanak, meditate forever in your heart on the Lord, and then everyone will congratulate you. ||4||10||62||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
Join the Sat Sangat, the Lord's True Congregation; joining the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
With the sparkling jewel of spiritual wisdom, the heart is illumined, and ignorance is dispelled. ||1||
O humble servant of the Lord, let your dancing be meditation on the Lord, Har, Har.
If only I cold meet such Saints, O my Siblings of Destiny; I would wash the feet of such servants. ||1||Pause||
Meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O my mind; night and day, center your consciousness on the Lord.
You shall have the fruits of your desires, and you shall never feel hunger again. ||2||
The Infinite Lord Himself is the Creator; the Lord Himself speaks, and causes us to speak.
The Saints are good, who are pleasing to Your Will; their honor is approved by You. ||3||
Nanak is not satisfied by chanting the Lord's Glorious Praises; the more he chants them, the more he is at peace.
The Lord Himself has bestowed the treasure of devotional love; His customers purchase virtues, and carry them home. ||4||11||63||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 023

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Eighth House, Kaafee, Fourth Mehl:
Death is ordained from the very beginning, and yet ego makes us cry.
Meditating on the Naam, as Gurmukh, one becomes stable and steady. ||1||
Blessed is the Perfect Guru, through whom the way of Death is known.
The sublime people earn the profit of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they are absorbed in the Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
The days of one's life are pre-ordained; they will come to their end, O mother.
One must depart, today or tomorrow, according to the Lord's Primal Order. ||2||
Useless are the lives of those, who have forgotten the Naam.
They play the game of chance in this world, and lose their mind. ||3||
Those who have found the Guru are at peace, in life and in death.
O Nanak, the true ones are truly absorbed into the True Lord. ||4||12||64||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
Having obtained the treasure of this human birth, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, I understand, and I am absorbed into the True Lord. ||1||
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny practice the Naam.
The True Lord summons the truthful to the Mansion of His Presence. ||1||Pause||
Deep within is the treasure of the Naam; it is obtained by the Gurmukh.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Deep within are infinite substances, but the self-willed manmukh does not find them.
In egotism and pride, the mortal's proud self consumes him. ||3||
O Nanak, his identity consumes his identical identity.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the mind is illumined, and meets the True Lord. ||4||13||65||
Raag Aasaavaree, 2 Of Sixteenth House, Fourth Mehl, Sudhang:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Night and day, I sing the Kirtan, the Praises of the Name of the Lord.
The True Guru has revealed to me the Name of the Lord; without the Lord, I cannot live, for a moment, even an instant. ||1||Pause||
My ears hear the Lord's Kirtan, and I contemplate Him; without the Lord, I cannot live, even for an instant.
As the swan cannot live without the lake, how can the Lord's slave live without serving Him? ||1||
Some enshrine love for duality in their hearts, and some pledge love for worldly attachments and ego.
The Lord's servant embraces love for the Lord and the state of Nirvaanaa; Nanak contemplates the Lord, the Lord God. ||2||14||66||
Aasaavaree, Fourth Mehl:
O mother, my mother, tell me about my Beloved Lord.
Without the Lord, I cannot live for a moment, even an instant; I love Him, like the camel loves the vine. ||1||Pause||
My mind has become sad and distant, longing for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, my Friend.
As the bumblebee cannot live without the lotus, I cannot live without the Lord. ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 024

Keep me under Your Protection, O Beloved Master of the Universe; fulfill my faith, O Lord of the World.
Servant Nanak's mind is filled with bliss, when he beholds the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, even for an instant. ||2||39||13||15||67||
Raag Aasaa, Second House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
One who loves her, is ultimately devoured.
One who seats her in comfort, is totally terrified by her.
Siblings, friends and family, beholding her, argue.
But she has come under my control, by Guru's Grace. ||1||
Beholding her, all are bewitched:
the strivers, the Siddhas, the demi-gods, angels and mortals. All, except the Saadhus, are deceived by her deception. ||1||Pause||
Some wander around as renunciates, but they are engrossed in sexual desire.
Some grow rich as householders, but she does not belong to them.
Some call themselves men of charity, and she torments them terribly.
The Lord has saved me, by attaching me to the Feet of the True Guru. ||2||
She leads astray the penitents who practice penance.
The scholarly Pandits are all seduced by greed.
The world of the three qualities is enticed, and the heavens are enticed.
The True Guru has saved me, by giving me His Hand. ||3||
She is the slave of those who are spiritually wise.
With her palms pressed together, she serves them and offers her prayer:
“Whatever you wish, that is what I shall do.”
O servant Nanak, she does not draw near to the Gurmukh. ||4||1||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have been separated from my Beloved by Maya (my mother-in-law).
Hope and desire (my younger brother-in-law and sister-in-law) are dying of grief.
I am no longer swayed by the fear of Death (my elder brother-in-law).
I am protected by my All-knowing, Wise Husband Lord. ||1||
Listen, O people: I have tasted the elixir of love.
The evil ones are dead, and my enemies are destroyed. The True Guru has given me the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
First, I renounced my egotistical love of myself.
Second, I renounced the ways of the world.
Renouncing the three qualities, I look alike upon friend and enemy.
And then, the fourth state of bliss was revealed to me by the Holy One. ||2||
In the cave of celestial bliss, I have obtained a seat.
The Lord of Light plays the unstruck melody of bliss.
I am in ecstasy, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Imbued with my Beloved Husband Lord, I am the blessed, happy soul-bride. ||3||
Servant Nanak chants the wisdom of God;
one who listens and practices it, is carried across and saved.
He is not born, and he does not die; he does not come or go.
He remains blended with the Lord. ||4||2||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The bride shows such special devotion, and has such an agreeable disposition.
Her beauty is incomparable, and her character is perfect.
The house in which she dwells is such a praiseworthy house.
But rare are those who, as Gurmukh, attain that state||1||
As the soul-bride of pure actions, I have met with the Guru.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 025

In worship, marriage and in the next world, such a soul-bride looks beautiful. ||1||Pause||
As long as she lived with her father,
her Husband wandered around in sadness.
I served and surrendered to the Lord, the True Being;
the Guru brought my bride to my home, and I obtained total happiness. ||2||
She is blessed with all sublime attributes, and her generations are unblemished.
Her Husband, her Lord and Master, fulfills her heart's desires.
Hope and desire (my younger brother-in-law and sister-in-law) are now totally content. ||3||
She is the most noble of all the family.
She counsels and advises her hope and desire.
How blessed is that household, in which she has appeared.
O servant Nanak, she passes her time in perfect peace and comfort. ||4||3||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever I resolve, she does not allow it to come to pass.
She stands blocking the way of goodness and self-discipline.
She wears many disguises, and assumes many forms,
and she does not allow me to dwell in my own home. She forces me to wander around in different directions. ||1||
She has become the mistress of my home, and she does not allow me to live in it.
If I try, she fights with me. ||1||Pause||
In the beginning, she was sent as a helper,
but she has overwhelmed the nine continents, all places and interspaces.
She has not spared even the river banks, the sacred shrines of pilgrimage, the Yogis and Sannyaasees,
or those who tirelessly read the Simritees and study the Vedas. ||2||
Wherever I sit, she sits there with me.
She has imposed her power upon the whole world.
Seeking meager protection, I am not protected from her.
Tell me, O my friend: unto whom should I turn for protection? ||3||
I heard of His Teachings, and so I have come to the True Guru.
The Guru has implanted the Mantra of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, within me.
And now, I dwell in the home of my own inner self; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord.
I have met God, O Nanak, and I have become care-free. ||4||
My home is now my own, and she is now my mistress.
She is now my servant, and the Guru has made me intimate with the Lord. ||1||Second Pause||4||4||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
First, they advised me to send a letter.
Second, they advised me to send two men.
Third, they advised me to make the effort and do something.
But I have renounced everything, and I meditate only on You, God. ||1||
Now, I am totally blissful, carefree and at ease.
The enemies and evil-doers have perished, and I have obtained peace. ||1||Pause||
The True Guru has imparted the Teachings to me.
My soul, body and everything belong to the Lord.
Whatever I do, is by Your Almighty Power.
You are my only Support, You are my only Court. ||2||
If I were to renounce You, God, unto whom could I turn?
There is no other, comparable to You.
Who else is Your servant to serve?
The faithless cynics are deluded; they wander around in the wilderness. ||3||
Your Glorious Greatness cannot be described.
Wherever I am, you save me, hugging me close in Your embrace.
Nanak, Your slave, has entered Your Sanctuary.
God has preserved his honor, and congratulations are pouring in. ||4||5||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 026

Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Having wandered through foreign lands, I have come here to do business.
I heard of the incomparable and profitable merchandise.
I have gathered in my pockets my capital of virtue, and I have brought it here with me.
Beholding the jewel, this mind is fascinated. ||1||
I have come to the door of the Trader.
Please display the merchandise, so that the business may be transacted. ||1||Pause||
The Trader has sent me to the Banker.
The jewel is priceless, and the capital is priceless.
O my gentle brother, mediator and friend
\- I have obtained the merchandise, and my consciousness is now steady and stable. ||2||
I have no fear of thieves, of wind or water.
I have easily made my purchase, and I easily take it away.
I have earned Truth, and I shall have no pain.
I have brought this merchandise home, safe and sound. ||3||
I have earned the profit, and I am happy.
Blessed is the Banker, the Perfect Bestower.
How rare is the Gurmukh who obtains this merchandise;
Nanak has brought this profitable merchandise home. ||4||6||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He does not consider my merits or demerits.
He does not look at my beauty, color or decorations.
I do not know the ways of wisdom and good conduct.
But taking me by the arm, my Husband Lord has led me to His Bed. ||1||
Hear, O my companions, my Husband, my Lord Master, possesses me.
Placing His Hand upon my forehead, He protects me as His Own. What do these ignorant people know? ||1||Pause||
My married life now appears so beauteous;
my Husband Lord has met me, and He sees all my pains.
Within the courtyard of my heart, the glory of the moon shines.
Night and day, I have fun with my Beloved. ||2||
My clothes are dyed the deep crimson color of the poppy.
All the ornaments and garlands around my neck adorn me.
Gazing upon my Beloved with my eyes, I have obtained all treasures;
I have shaken off the power of the evil demons. ||3||
I have obtained eternal bliss, and I constantly celebrate.
With the nine treasures of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am satisfied in my own home.
Says Nanak, when the happy soul-bride is adorned by her Beloved,
she is forever happy with her Husband Lord. ||4||7||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
They give you donations and worship you.
You take from them, and then deny that they have given anything to you.
That door, through which you must ultimately go, O Brahmin
\- at that door, you will come to regret and repent. ||1||
Such Brahmins shall drown, O Siblings of Destiny;
they think of doing evil to the innocent. ||1||Pause||
Within them is greed, and they wander around like mad dogs.
They slander others and carry loads of sin upon their heads.
Intoxicated by Maya, they do not think of the Lord.
Deluded by doubt, they wander off on many paths. ||2||
Outwardly, they wear various religious robes,
but within, they are enveloped by poison.
They instruct others, but do not understand themselves.
Such Brahmins will never be emancipated. ||3||
O foolish Brahmin, reflect upon God.
He watches and hears, and is always with you.
Says Nanak, if this is your destiny,
renounce your pride, and grasp the Guru's Feet. ||4||8||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 027

Pain and disease have left my body, and my mind has become pure; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.
I am in bliss, meeting with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and now, my mind does not go wandering. ||1||
My burning desires are quenched, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, O mother.
The fever of doubt has been totally eliminated; meeting the Guru, I am cooled and soothed, with intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||
My wandering has ended, since I have realized the One and Only Lord; now, I have come to dwell in the eternal place.
Your Saints are the Saving Grace of the world; beholding the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, I remain satisfied. ||2||
I have left behind the sins of countless incarnations, now that I have grasped the feet of the eternal Holy Guru.
My mind sings the celestial melody of bliss,
and death shall no longer consume it. ||3||
My Lord, the Cause of all causes, is All-powerful, the Giver of peace; He is my Lord, my Lord King.
Nanak lives by chanting Your Name, O Lord; You are my helper, with me, through and through. ||4||9||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The slanderer cries out and bewails.
He has forgotten the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent Lord; the slanderer reaps the rewards of his own actions. ||1||Pause||
If someone is his companion, then he shall be taken along with him.
Like the dragon, the slanderer carries his huge, useless loads, and burns in his own fire. ||1||
Nanak proclaims and announces what happens at the Door of the Transcendent Lord.
The humble devotees of the Lord are forever in bliss; singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, they blossom forth. ||2||10||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Even though I totally decorated myself,
still, my mind was not satisfied.
I applied various scented oils to my body,
and yet, I did not obtain even a tiny bit of pleasure from this.
Within my mind, I hold such a desire,
that I may live only to behold my Beloved, O my mother. ||1||
O mother, what should I do? This mind cannot rest.
It is bewitched by the tender love of my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
Garments, ornaments, and such exquisite pleasures
\- I look upon these as of no account.
Likewise, honor, fame, dignity and greatness,
obedience by the whole world,
and a household as beautiful as a jewel.
If I am pleasing to God's Will, then I shall be blessed, and forever in bliss. ||2||
With foods and delicacies of so many different kinds,
and such abundant pleasures and entertainments,
power and property and absolute command
\- with these, the mind is not satisfied, and its thirst is not quenched.
Without meeting Him, this day does not pass.
Meeting God, I find peace. ||3||
By searching and seeking, I have heard this news,
that without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, no one swims across.
One who has this good destiny written upon his forehead, finds the True Guru.
His hopes are fulfilled, and his mind is satisfied.
When one meets God, then his thirst is quenched.
Nanak has found the Lord, within his mind and body. ||4||11||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Panch-Padas:

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 028

First, your social status is high.
Second, you are honored in society.
Third, your home is beautiful.
But you are so ugly, with self-conceit in your mind. ||1||
O beautiful, attractive, wise and clever woman:
you have been trapped by your pride and attachment. ||1||Pause||
Your kitchen is so clean.
You take your bath, and worship, and apply the crimson mark upon your forehead;
with your mouth you speak wisdom, but you are destroyed by pride.
The dog of greed has ruined you in every way. ||2||
You wear your robes and enjoy pleasures;
you practice good conduct to impress people;
you apply scented oils of sandalwood and musk,
but your constant companion is the demon of anger. ||3||
Other people may be your water-carriers;
in this world, you may be a ruler.
Gold, silver and wealth may be yours,
but the goodness of your conduct has been destroyed by sexual promiscuity. ||4||
That soul, upon whom the Lord has bestowed His Glance of Grace,
is delivered from bondage.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Lord's sublime essence is obtained.
Says Nanak, how fruitful is that body. ||5||
All graces and all comforts shall come to you, as the happy soul-bride;
you shall be supremely beautiful and wise. ||1||Second Pause||12||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Ik-Tukas 2 :
One who is seen to be alive, shall surely die.
But he who is dead shall remain ever-lasting. ||1||
Those who die while yet alive, shall through this death, live on.
They place the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, as medicine in their mouths, and through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
The clay pot of the body shall be broken.
One who has eliminated the three qualities dwells in the home of his inner self. ||2||
One who climbs high, shall fall into the nether regions of the underworld.
One who lies upon the ground, shall not be touched by death. ||3||
Those who continue to wander around, achieve nothing.
Those who practice the Guru's Teachings, become steady and stable. ||4||
This body and soul all belong to the Lord.
O Nanak, meeting the Guru, I am enraptured. ||5||13||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The puppet of the body has been fashioned with great skill.
Know for sure that it shall turn to dust. ||1||
Remember your origins, O thoughtless fool.
Why are you so proud of yourself? ||1||Pause||
You are a guest, given three meals a day;
other things are entrusted to you. ||2||
you are just excrement, bones and blood, wrapped up in skin
\- this is what you are taking such pride in! ||3||
If you could understand even one thing, then you would be pure.
Without understanding, you shall be forever impure. ||4||
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru;
through Him, I obtain the Lord, the All-knowing Primal Being. ||5||14||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Ik-Tukas, Chau-Padas:
One moment, one day, is for me many days.
My mind cannot survive - how can I meet my Beloved? ||1||
I cannot endure one day, even one instant without Him.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 029

My mind's desire for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is so great. Is there any Saint who can lead me to meet my Beloved? ||1||Pause||
The four watches of the day are like the four ages.
And when night comes, I think that it shall never end. ||2||
The five demons have joined together, to separate me from my Husband Lord.
Wandering and rambling, I cry out and wring my hands. ||3||
The Lord has revealed the Blessed Vision of His Darshan to servant Nanak;
realizing his own self, he has obtained supreme peace. ||4||15||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
In the Lord's service, are the greatest treasures.
Serving the Lord, the Ambrosial Naam comes into one's mouth. ||1||
The Lord is my Companion; He is with me, as my Help and Support.
In pain and pleasure, whenever I remember Him, He is present. How can the poor Messenger of Death frighten me now? ||1||Pause||
The Lord is my Support; the Lord is my Power.
The Lord is my Friend; He is my mind's advisor. ||2||
The Lord is my capital; the Lord is my credit.
As Gurmukh, I earn the wealth, with the Lord as my Banker. ||3||
By Guru's Grace, this wisdom has come.
Servant Nanak has merged into the Being of the Lord. ||4||16||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
When God shows His Mercy, then this mind is focused on Him.
Serving the True Guru, all rewards are obtained. ||1||
O my mind, why are you so sad? My True Guru is Perfect.
He is the Giver of blessings, the treasure of all comforts; His Ambrosial Pool of Nectar is always overflowing. ||1||Pause||
One who enshrines His Lotus Feet within the heart,
meets the Beloved Lord; the Divine Light is revealed to him. ||2||
The five companions have met together to sing the songs of joy.
The unstruck melody, the sound current of the Naad, vibrates and resounds. ||3||
O Nanak, when the Guru is totally pleased, one meets the Lord, the King.
Then, the night of one's life passes in peace and natural ease. ||4||17||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Showing His Mercy, the Lord has revealed Himself to me.
Meeting the True Guru, I have received the perfect wealth. ||1||
Gather such a wealth of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.
It cannot be burned by fire, and water cannot drown it; it does not forsake society, or go anywhere else. ||1||Pause||
It does not run short, and it does not run out.
Eating and consuming it, the mind remains satisfied. ||2||
He is the true banker, who gathers the wealth of the Lord within his own home.
With this wealth, the whole world profits. ||3||
He alone receives the Lord's wealth, who is pre-ordained to receive it.
O servant Nanak, at that very last moment, the Naam shall be your only decoration. ||4||18||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Just like the farmer, He plants His crop,
and, whether it is ripe or unripe, He cuts it down. ||1||
Just so, you must know this well, that whoever is born, shall die.
Only the devotee of the Lord of the Universe becomes stable and permanent. ||1||Pause||
The day shall certainly be followed by the night.
And when the night passes, the morning shall again dawn. ||2||
In the love of Maya, the unfortunate ones remain in sleep.
By Guru's Grace, a rare few remain awake and aware. ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 030

Says Nanak, sing continually the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Your face shall be radiant, and your consciousness shall be immaculately pure. ||4||19||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The nine treasures are Yours - all treasures are Yours.
The Fulfiller of desires saves mortals in the end. ||1||
You are my Beloved, so what hunger can I have?
When You dwell within my mind, pain does not touch me. ||1||Pause||
Whatever You do, is acceptable to me.
O True Lord and Master, True is Your Order. ||2||
When it is pleasing to Your Will, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Within Your Home, there is justice, forever and ever. ||3||
O True Lord and Master, You are unknowable and mysterious.
Nanak is committed to Your service. ||4||20||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He is near at hand; He is the eternal Companion of the soul.
His Creative Power is all-pervading, in form and color. ||1||
My mind does not worry; it does not grieve, or cry out.
Imperishable, Unshakable, Unapproachable and forever safe and sound is my Husband Lord. ||1||Pause||
Unto whom does Your servant pay homage?
His King preserves his honor. ||2||
That slave, whom God has released from the restrictions of social status
\- who can now hold him in bondage? ||3||
The Lord is absolutely independent, and totally care-free;
O servant Nanak, chant His Glorious Praises. ||4||21||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Forsaking the Lord's sublime essence, the mortal is intoxicated with false essences.
The substance is within the home of the self, but the mortal goes out to find it. ||1||
He cannot hear the true ambrosial discourse.
Attached to false scriptures, he is engaged in argument. ||1||Pause||
He takes his wages from his Lord and Master, but he serves another.
With such sins, the mortal is engrossed. ||2||
He tries to hide from the One who is always with him.
He begs from Him, again and again. ||3||
Says Nanak, God is merciful to the meek.
As it pleases Him, He cherishes us. ||4||22||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my soul, my life, my wealth.
Here and hereafter, it is with me, to help me. ||1||
Without the Lord's Name, everything else is useless.
My mind is satisfied and satiated by the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||1||Pause||
Gurbani is the jewel, the treasure of devotion.
Singing, hearing and acting upon it, one is enraptured. ||2||
My mind is attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet.
The True Guru, in His Pleasure, has given this gift. ||3||
Unto Nanak, the Guru has revealed these instructions:
recognize the Imperishable Lord God in each and every heart. ||4||23||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The All-pervading Lord has established joys and celebrations.
He Himself embellishes His own works. ||1||
Perfect is the Creation of the Perfect Lord Master.
His magnificent greatness is totally all-pervading. ||1||Pause||
His Name is the treasure; His reputation is immaculate.
He Himself is the Creator; there is no other. ||2||
All beings and creatures are in His Hands.
God is pervading in all, and is always with them. ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 031

The Perfect Guru has fashioned His perfect fashion.
O Nanak, the Lord's devotees are blessed with glorious greatness. ||4||24||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have shaped this mind in the mold of the Guru's Word.
Beholding the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I have gathered the wealth of the Lord. ||1||
O sublime understanding, come, enter into my mind,
that I may meditate and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and love so dearly the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
I am satisfied and satiated by the True Name.
My cleansing bath at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage is the dust of the Saints. ||2||
I recognize that the One Creator is contained in all.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my understanding is refined. ||3||
I have become the servant of all; I have renounced my ego and pride.
The Guru has given this gift to Nanak. ||4||25||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My intellect has been enlightened, and my understanding is perfect.
Thus my evil-mindedness, which kept me far from Him, has been removed. ||1||
Such are the Teachings which I have received from the Guru;
while I was drowning in the pitch black well, I was saved, O my Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
The Guru is the boat to cross over the totally unfathomable ocean of fire; He is treasure of jewels. ||2||
This ocean of Maya is dark and treacherous.
The Perfect Guru has revealed the way to cross over it. ||3||
I do not have the ability to chant or practice intense meditation.
Guru Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||4||26||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Ti-Padas:
One who drinks in the Lord's sublime essence is forever imbued with it,
while other essences wear off in an instant.
Intoxicated with the Lord's sublime essence, the mind is forever in ecstasy.
Other essences bring only anxiety. ||1||
One who drinks in the Lord's sublime essence, is intoxicated and enraptured;
all other essences have no effect. ||1||Pause||
The value of the Lord's sublime essence cannot be described.
The Lord's sublime essence permeates the homes of the Holy.
One may spend thousands and millions, but it cannot be purchased.
He alone obtains it, who is so pre-ordained. ||2||
Tasting it, Nanak is wonder-struck.
Through the Guru, Nanak has obtained this taste.
Here and hereafter, it does not leave him.
Nanak is imbued and enraptured with the Lord's subtle essence. ||3||27||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
If she renounces and eliminates her sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment, and her evil-mindedness and self-conceit as well;
and if, becoming humble, she serves Him, then she becomes dear to her Beloved's Heart. ||1||
Listen, O beautiful soul-bride: By the Word of the Holy Saint, you shall be saved.
Your pain, hunger and doubt shall vanish, and you shall obtain peace, O happy soul-bride. ||1||Pause||
Washing the Guru's feet, and serving Him, the soul is sanctified, and the thirst for sin is quenched.
If you become the slave of the slave of the Lord's slaves, then you shall obtain honor in the Court of the Lord. ||2||
This is right conduct, and this is the correct lifestyle, to obey the Command of the Lord's Will; this is your devotional worship.
One who practices this Mantra, O Nanak, swims across the terrifying world-ocean. ||3||28||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 032

Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas:
You have been blessed with this human body.
This is your chance to meet the Lord of the Universe.
Other efforts are of no use to you.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, vibrate and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Make the effort, and cross over the terrifying world ocean.
This human life is passing away in vain, in the love of Maya. ||1||Pause||
I have not practiced meditation, penance, self-restraint or righteous living;
I have not served the Holy Saints, and I do not know the Lord, my King.
Says Nanak, my actions are vile and despicable;
O Lord, I seek Your Sanctuary - please, preserve my honor. ||2||29||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Without You, there is no other for me; You alone are in my mind.
You are my Friend and Companion, God; why should my soul be afraid? ||1||
You are my support, You are my hope.
While sitting down or standing up, while sleeping or waking, with every breath and morsel of food, I never forget You. ||1||Pause||
Protect me, please protect me, O God; I have come to Your Sanctuary; the ocean of fire is so horrible.
The True Guru is the Giver of peace to Nanak; I am Your child, O Lord of the World. ||2||30||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord God has saved me, His slave.
My mind has surrendered to my Beloved; my fever has taken poison and died. ||1||Pause||
Cold and heat do not touch me at all, when I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
My consciousness is not affected by the witch, Maya; I take to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saints, the Lord has shown His Mercy to me; He Himself is my Help and Support.
Nanak ever sings the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of excellence; his doubts and pains are eliminated. ||2||31||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have taken the medicine of the Name of the Lord.
I have found peace, and the seat of pain has been removed. ||1||
The fever has been broken, by the Teachings of the Perfect Guru.
I am in ecstasy, and all of my sorrows have been dispelled. ||1||Pause||
All beings and creatures obtain peace,
O Nanak, meditating on the Supreme Lord God. ||2||32||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
That time, which the mortal does not wish for, eventually comes.
Without the Lord's Command, how can understanding be understood? ||1||
The body is consumed by water, fire and earth.
But the soul is neither young nor old, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
Servant Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Holy.
By Guru's Grace, he has shaken off the fear of death. ||2||33||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Forever and ever, the soul is illumined;
in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, it dwells at the Feet of the Lord. ||1||
Chant the Lord's Name each and every day, O my mind.
You shall find lasting peace, contentment and tranquility, and all your sins shall depart. ||1||Pause||
Says Nanak, one who is blessed with perfect good karma,
meets the True Guru, and obtains the Perfect Supreme Lord God. ||2||34||
Thirty-four Shabads in Second House. ||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
She who has the Lord God as her Friend

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 033

her pain is dispelled, and she shall not become sad again. ||1||Pause||
Showing His Mercy, He joins her with His Feet,
and she attains celestial peace, joy and comfort. ||1||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, she sings the Glorious Praises of the Immeasurable Lord.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, O Nanak, she becomes invaluable. ||2||35||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Sexual desire, anger, intoxication with Maya and jealousy - I have lost all of these in the game of chance.
Purity, contentment, compassion, faith and truthfulness - I have ushered these into the home of my self. ||1||
All the loads of birth and death have been removed.
Joining the Saints' Society, my mind has become pure; the Perfect Guru has saved me in an instant. ||1||Pause||
My mind has become the dust of all, and everyone seems a sweet friend to me.
My Lord and Master is contained in all. He gives His Gifts to all beings, and cherishes them. ||2||
He Himself is the One and only; from the One, the One and only, came the expanse of the entire creation.
Chanting and meditating, all the humble beings have become Holy; meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, so many have been saved. ||3||
The Lord of the Universe is deep, profound and infinite; He has no end or limitation.
By Your Grace, Nanak sings Your Glorious Praises; meditating, meditating, he humbly bows to God. ||4||36||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
You are Infinite, Eternal and Incomprehensible; all this is Your Creation.
What clever games can we play, when everything is contained in You? ||1||
O my True Guru, protect me, Your child, through the power of Your play.
Grant me the good sense to ever sing Your Glorious Praises, O my Inaccessible and Infinite Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
The mortal is preserved in the womb of his mother, by the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord;
he makes merry, and with each and every breath he remembers the Lord, and the fire does not touch him. ||2||
Others' wealth, others' wives, and the slander of others - renounce your craving for these.
Serve the Lord's Lotus Feet within your heart, and hold to the Support of the Perfect Guru. ||3||
Houses, mansions and palaces which you see - none of these shall go with you.
As long as you live in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O servant Nanak, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||37||
Aasaa, Third House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Power, property, youth, household, fame and the beauty of youth;
great wealth, elephants, horses and jewels, purchased with tens of thousands of dollars;
hereafter, these shall be of no avail in the Court of the Lord; the proud must depart, leaving them behind. ||1||
Why center your consciousness on any other than the Lord?
Sitting down, standing up, sleeping and waking, forever and ever, meditate on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
He may have the most wondrous and beautiful arenas, and be victorious on the field of battle.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 034

He may proclaim, “I can kill anyone, I can capture anyone, and I can release anyone.”
But when the Order comes from the Supreme Lord God, he departs and leaves in a day. ||2||
He may perform all sorts of religious rituals and good actions, but he does not know the Creator Lord, the Doer of all.
He teaches, but does not practice what he preaches; he does not realize the essential reality of the Word of the Shabad.
Naked he came, and naked he shall depart; he is like an elephant, throwing dust on himself. ||3||
O Saints, and friends, listen to me: all this world is false.
Continually claiming, “Mine, mine”, the mortals are drowned; the fools waste away and die.
Meeting the Guru, O Nanak, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the True Name, I am emancipated. ||4||1||38||
Raag Aasaa, Fifth House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The whole world is asleep in doubt; it is blinded by worldly entanglements.
How rare is that humble servant of the Lord who is awake and aware. ||1||
The mortal is intoxicated with the great enticement of Maya, which is dearer to him than life.
How rare is the one who renounces it. ||2||
The Lord's Lotus Feet are incomparably beautiful; so is the Mantra of the Saint.
How rare is that holy person who is attached to them. ||3||
O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the love of divine knowledge is awakened;
the Lord's Mercy is bestowed upon those who are blessed with such good destiny. ||4||1||39||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Sixth House, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever pleases You is acceptable to me; that alone brings peace and ease to my mind.
You are the Doer, the Cause of causes, All-powerful and Infinite; there is none other than You. ||1||
Your humble servants sing Your Glorious Praises with enthusiasm and love.
That alone is good advice, wisdom and cleverness for Your humble servant, which You do or cause to be done. ||1||Pause||
Your Name is Ambrosial Nectar, O Beloved Lord; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have obtained its sublime essence.
Those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled, singing the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of peace. ||2||
One who has Your Support, O Lord Master, is not afflicted by anxiety.
One who is blessed by Your Kind Mercy, is the best, the most fortunate king. ||3||
Doubt, attachment, and deceit have all disappeared, since I obtained the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
Dealing in the Naam, O Nanak, we become truthful, and in the Love of the Lord's Name, we are absorbed. ||4||1 | 40||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He washes off the filth of other peoples' incarnations, but he obtains the rewards of his own actions.
He has no peace in this world, and he has no place in the Court of the Lord. In the City of Death, he is tortured. ||1||
The slanderer loses his life in vain.
He cannot succeed in anything, and in the world hereafter, he finds no place at all. ||1||Pause||
Such is the fate of the wretched slanderer - what can the poor creature do?
He is ruined there, where no one can protect him; with whom should he lodge his complaint? ||2||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 035

The slanderer shall never attain emancipation; this is the Will of the Lord and Master.
The more the Saints are slandered, the more they dwell in peace. ||3||
The Saints have Your Support, O Lord and Master; You are the Saints' Help and Support.
Says Nanak, the Saints are saved by the Lord; the slanderers are drowned in the deep. ||4||2||41||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He washes outwardly, but within, his mind is filthy; thus he loses his place in both worlds.
Here, he is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment; hereafter, he shall sigh and weep. ||1||
The way to vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the Universe is different.
Destroying the snake-hole, the snake is not killed; the deaf person does not hear the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
He renounces the affairs of Maya, but he does not appreciate the value of devotional worship.
He finds fault with the Vedas and the Shaastras, and does not know the essence of Yoga. ||2||
He stands exposed, like a counterfeit coin, when inspected by the Lord, the Assayer.
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything; how can we hide anything from Him? ||3||
Through falsehood, fraud and deceit, the mortal collapses in an instant - he has no foundation at all.
Truly, truly, truly, Nanak speaks; look within your own heart, and realize this. ||4||3||42||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Making the effort, the mind becomes pure; in this dance, the self is silenced.
The five passions are kept under control, and the One Lord dwells in the mind. ||1||
Your humble servant dances and sings Your Glorious Praises.
He plays upon the guitar, tambourine and cymbals, and the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds. ||1||Pause||
First, he instructs his own mind, and then, he leads others.
He chants the Lord's Name and meditates on it in his heart; with his mouth, he announces it to all. ||2||
He joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and washes their feet; he applies the dust of the Saints to his body
He surrenders his mind and body, and places them before the Guru; thus, he obtains the true wealth. ||3||
Whoever listens to, and beholds the Guru with faith, shall see his pains of birth and death taken away.
Such a dance eliminates hell; O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains wakeful. ||4||4||43||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The lowly outcaste becomes a Brahmin, and the untouchable sweeper becomes pure and sublime.
The burning desire of the nether regions and the etheric realms is finally quenched and extinguished. ||1||
The house-cat has been taught otherwise, and is terrified upon seeing the mouse.
The Guru has put the tiger under the control of the sheep, and now, the dog eats grass. ||1||Pause||
Without pillars, the roof is supported, and the homeless have found a home.
Without the jeweller, the jewel has been set, and the wonderful stone shines forth. ||2||
The claimant does not succeed by placing his claim, but by keeping silent, he obtains justice.
The dead sit on costly carpets, and what is seen with the eyes shall vanish. ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 036

One who claims to know, is ignorant; he does not know the Knower of all.
Says Nanak, the Guru has given me the Ambrosial Nectar to drink in; savoring it and relishing it, I blossom forth in bliss. ||4||5||44||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He has cut away my bonds, and overlooked my shortcomings, and so He has confirmed His nature.
Becoming merciful to me, like a mother or a father, he has come to cherish me as His own child. ||1||
The GurSikhs are preserved by the Guru, by the Lord of the Universe.
He rescues them from the terrible world ocean, casting His Glance of Grace upon them. ||1||Pause||
Meditating in remembrance on Him, we escape from the Messenger of Death; here and hereafter, we obtain peace.
With every breath and morsel of food, meditate, and chant with your tongue, continually, each and every day; sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Through loving devotional worship, the supreme status is obtained, and in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sorrows are dispelled.
I am not worn down, I do not die, and nothing strikes fear in me, since I have the wealth of the Lord's Immaculate Name in my purse. ||3||
At the very last moment, God becomes the mortal's Help and Support; here and hereafter, He is the Savior Lord.
He is my breath of life, my friend, support and wealth; O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||4||6||45||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Since You are my Lord and Master, what is there for me to fear? Other than You, who else should I praise?
You are the One and only, and so do all things exist; without You, there is nothing at all for me. ||1||
O Father, I have seen that the world is poison.
Save me, O Lord of the Universe! Your Name is my only Support. ||1||Pause||
You know completely the condition of my mind; who else could I go to tell of it?
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the whole world has gone crazy; obtaining the Naam, it finds peace. ||2||
What shall I say? Unto whom shall I speak? What I have to say, I say to God.
Everything which exists was created by You. You are my hope, forever and ever. ||3||
If you bestow greatness, then it is Your greatness; here and hereafter, I meditate on You.
The Lord God of Nanak is forever the Giver of peace; Your Name is my only strength. ||4||7||46||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Your Name is Ambrosial Nectar, O Lord Master; Your humble servant drinks in this supreme elixir.
The fearful load of sins from countless incarnations has vanished; doubt and duality are also dispelled. ||1||
I live by beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
Listening to Your Words, O True Guru, my mind and body are cooled and soothed. ||1||Pause||
By Your Grace, I have joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; You Yourself have caused this to happen.
Holding fast to Your Feet, O God, the poison is easily neutralized. ||2||
Your Name, O God, is the treasure of peace; I have received this everlasting Mantra.
Showing His Mercy, the True Guru has given it to me, and my fever and pain and hatred are annulled. ||3||
Blessed is the attainment of this human body, by which God blends Himself with me.
Blessed, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, is the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung.O Nanak, the Naam is my only Support. ||4||8||47||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 037

Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Everything is pre-ordained; what else can be known through study?
The errant child has been forgiven by the Supreme Lord God. ||1||
My True Guru is always merciful; He has saved me, the meek one.
He has cured me of my disease, and I have obtained the greatest peace; He has placed the Ambrosial Name of the Lord in my mouth. ||1||Pause||
He has washed away my countless sins; He has cut away my bonds, and I am liberated.
He has taken me by the arm, and pulled me out of the terrible, deep dark pit. ||2||
I have become fearless, and all my fears have been erased. The Savior Lord has saved me.
Such is Your generosity, O my God, that You have resolved all my affairs. ||3||
My mind has met with my Lord and Master, the treasure of excellence.
Taking to His Sanctuary, Nanak has become blissful. ||4||9||48||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
If I forget You, then everyone becomes my enemy. When You come to mind, then they serve me.
I do not know any other at all, O True, Invisible, Inscrutable Lord. ||1||
When You come to mind, You are always merciful to me; what can the poor people do to me?
Tell me, who should I call good or bad, since all beings are Yours? ||1||Pause||
You are my Shelter, You are my Support; giving me Your hand, You protect me.
That humble being, upon whom You bestow Your Grace, is not touched by slander or suffering. ||2||
That is peace, and that is greatness, which is pleasing to the mind of the Dear Lord God.
You are all-knowing, You are forever compassionate; obtaining Your Name, I revel in it and make merry. ||3||
I offer my prayer to You; my body and soul are all Yours.
Says Nanak, this is all Your greatness; no one even knows my name. ||4||10||49||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Show Your Mercy, O God, O Searcher of hearts, that in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I might obtain You, Lord.
When You open Your Door, and reveal the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, the mortal is not relegated to reincarnation again. ||1||
Meeting with my Beloved Lord aand Master, all my pains are taken away.
I am saved and carried across, in the company of those who remember the Supreme Lord God in their hearts. ||1||Pause||
This world is a great wilderness, an ocean of fire, in which mortals abide, in pleasure and pain.
Meeting with the True Guru, the mortal becomes immaculately pure; with his tongue, he chants the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. ||2||
He preserves his body and wealth, and takes everything as his own; such are the subtle bonds which bind him.
By Guru's Grace, the mortal becomes liberated, meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
God, the Savior, has saved those, who are pleasing to the Will of God.
The soul and body are all Yours, O Great Giver; O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice. ||4||11||50||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
You have avoided the slumber of attachment and impurity - by whose favor has this happened?
The great enticer does not affect you. Where has your laziness gone? ||1||Pause||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 038

How have you escaped from the treachery of sexual desire, anger and egotism?
The holy beings, angels and demons of the three qualities, and all the worlds have been plundered. ||1||
The forest fire has burnt down so much of the grass; how rare are the plants which have remained green.
He is so All-powerful, that I cannot even describe Him; no one can chant His Praises. ||2||
In the store-room of the lamp-black, I did not turn black; my color remained immaculate and pure.
The Guru has implanted the Maha Mantra, the Great Mantra, within my heart, and I have heard the wondrous Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
Showing His Mercy, God has looked upon me with favor, and He has attached me to His feet.
Through loving devotional worship, O Nanak, I have obtained peace; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am absorbed into the Lord. ||4||12||51||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Seventh House, Fifth Mehl:
That red dress looks so beautiful on your body.
Your Husband Lord is pleased, and His heart is enticed. ||1||
Whose handiwork is this red beauty of yours?
Whose love has rendered the poppy so red? ||1||Pause||
You are so beautiful; you are the happy soul-bride.
Your Beloved is in your home; good fortune is in your home. ||2||
You are pure and chaste, you are most distinguished.
You are pleasing to Your Beloved, and you have sublime understanding. ||3||
I am pleasing to my Beloved, and so I am imbued with the deep red color.
Says Nanak, I have been totally blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace. ||4||
Listen, O companions: this is my only work;
God Himself is the One who embellishes and adorns. ||1||Second Pause||1||52||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I suffered in pain, when I thought He was far away;
but now, He is Ever-present, and I receive His instructions. ||1||
My pride is gone, O friends and companions;
my doubt is dispelled, and the Guru has united me with my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
My Beloved has drawn me near to Him, and seated me on His Bed;
I have escaped the clutches of others. ||2||
In the mansion of my heart, shines the Light of the Shabad.
My Husband Lord is blissful and playful. ||3||
According to the destiny written upon my forehead, my Husband Lord has come home to me.
Servant Nanak has obtained the eternal marriage. ||4||2||53||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My mind is attached to the True Name.
My dealings with other people are only superficial. ||1||
Outwardly, I am on good terms with all;
but I remain detached, like the lotus upon the water. ||1||Pause||
By word of mouth, I talk with everyone;
but I keep God clasped to my heart. ||2||
I may appear utterly terrible,
but my mind is the dust of all men's feet.
Servant Nanak has found the Perfect Guru.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 039

Inwardly and outwardly, He has shown me the One Lord. ||4||3||54||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The mortal revels in joy, in the vigor of youth;
but without the Name, he mingles with dust. ||1||
He may wear ear-rings and fine clothes,
and have a comfortable bed, and his mind may be so proud. ||1||Pause||
He may have elephants to ride, and golden umbrellas over his head;
but without devotional worship to the Lord, he is buried beneath the dirt. ||2||
He may enjoy many women, of exquisite beauty;
but without the sublime essence of the Lord, all tastes are tasteless. ||3||
Deluded by Maya, the mortal is led into sin and corruption.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the All-powerful, Compassionate Lord. ||4||4||55||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
There is a garden, in which so many plants have grown.
They bear the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam as their fruit. ||1||
Consider this, O wise one,
by which you may attain the state of Nirvaanaa.
All around this garden are pools of poison, but within it is the Ambrosial Nectar, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
There is only one gardener who tends it.
He takes care of every leaf and branch. ||2||
He brings all sorts of plants and plants them there.
They all bear fruit - none is without fruit. ||3||
One who receives the Ambrosial Fruit of the Naam from the Guru
\- O Nanak, such a servant crosses over the ocean of Maya. ||4||5||56||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The pleasures of royalty are derived from Your Name.
I attain Yoga, singing the Kirtan of Your Praises. ||1||
All comforts are obtained in Your Shelter.
The True Guru has removed the veil of doubt. ||1||Pause||
Understanding the Command of the Lord's Will, I revel in pleasure and joy.
Serving the True Guru, I obtain the supreme state of Nirvaanaa. ||2||
One who recognizes You is recognized as a householder, and as a renunciate.
Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he dwells in Nirvaanaa. ||3||
One who has obtained the treasure of the Naam
\- prays Nanak, his treasure-house is filled to overflowing. ||4||6||57||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Journeying to sacred shrines of pilgrimage, I see the mortals acting in ego.
If I ask the Pandits, I find them tainted by Maya. ||1||
Show me that place, O friend,
where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are forever sung. ||1||Pause||
The Shaastras and the Vedas speak of sin and virtue;
they say that mortals are reincarnated into heaven and hell, over and over again. ||2||
In the householder's life, there is anxiety, and in the life of the renunciate, there is egotism.
Performing religious rituals, the soul is entangled. ||3||
By God's Grace, the mind is brought under control;
O Nanak, the Gurmukh crosses over the ocean of Maya. ||4||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
This place is found through the Guru. ||1||Second Pause||7||58||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Within my home there is peace, and outwardly there is peace as well.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, all pains are erased. ||1||
There is total peace, when You come into my mind.

He alone is pleasing to Your Will, who chants the Naam. ||1||Pause||
My body and mind are cooled and soothed, chanting the Name of the Lord.
Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, the house of pain is demolished. ||2||
He alone, who understands the Command of the Lord's Will, is approved.
The True Shabad of the Word of God is his trademark and insignia. ||3||
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord's Name within me.
Prays Nanak, my mind has found peace. ||4||8||59||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Wherever You send me, there I go.
Whatever You give me, brings me peace. ||1||
I am forever the chaylaa, the humble disciple, of the Lord of the Universe, the Sustainer of the World.
By Your Grace, I am satisfied and satiated. ||1||Pause||
Whatever You give me, I wear and eat.
By Your Grace, O God, my life passes peacefully. ||2||
Deep within my mind and body, I meditate on You.
I recognize none as equal to You. ||3||
Says Nanak, this is my continual meditation:
that I may be emancipated, clinging to the Feet of the Saints. ||4||9||60||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
While standing up, and sitting down, and even while asleep, meditate on the Lord.
Walking on the Way, sing the Praises of the Lord. ||1||

Listening to it, your mind shall be filled with bliss, and the troubles and diseases of your mind shall all depart. ||1||Pause||
While you work at your job, on the road and at the beach, meditate and chant.
By Guru's Grace, drink in the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord. ||2||
The humble being who sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, day and night,
does not have to go with the Messenger of Death. ||3||
One who does not forget the Lord, twenty-four hours a day, is emancipated;
O Nanak, I fall at his feet. ||4||10||61||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:

one becomes happy, and suffering is ended. ||1||
Celebrate, make merry, and sing God's Glories.
Forever and ever, surrender to the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
Act in accordance with the Shabad, the True Word of the True Guru.
Remain steady and stable within the home of your own self, and find God. ||2||
Do not harbor evil intentions against others in your mind,
and you shall not be troubled, O Siblings of Destiny, O friends. ||3||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the Tantric exercise, and the Mantra, given by the Guru.
Nanak knows this peace alone, night and day. ||4||11||62||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
That wretched being, whom no one knows
\- chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he is honored in the four directions. ||1||
I beg for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; please, give it to me, O Beloved!
Serving You, who, who has not been saved? ||1||Pause||
That person, whom no one wants to be near
\- the whole world comes to wash the dirt of his feet. ||2||
That mortal, who is of no use to anyone at all
\- by the Grace of the Saints, he meditates on the Naam. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the sleeping mind awakens.
Then, O Nanak, God seems sweet. ||4||12||63||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
With my eyes, I behold the One and Only Lord.
Forever and ever, I contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||

I sing the Praises of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
By the graceful favor of the Saints, I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
Everything is strung on His string.
He is contained in each and every heart. ||2||
He creates and destroys in an instant.
He Himself remains unattached, and without attributes. ||3||
He is the Creator, the Cause of causes, the Searcher of hearts.
Nanak's Lord and Master celebrates in bliss. ||4||13||64||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My wandering through millions of births has ended.
I have won, and not lost, this human body, so difficult to obtain. ||1||
My sins have been erased, and my sufferings and pains are gone.
I have been sanctified by the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||Pause||
The Saints of God have the ability to save us;
they meet with those of us who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||2||
My mind is filled with bliss, since the Guru gave me the Mantra of the Lord's Name.
My thirst has been quenched, and my mind has become steady and stable. ||3||
The wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is for me the nine treasures, and the spiritual powers of the Siddhas.

Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I contemplate, forever and ever, the True Guru;
with my hair, I dust the feet of the Guru. ||1||
Be wakeful, O my awakening mind!
Without the Lord, nothing else shall be of use to you; false is emotional attachment, and useless are worldly entanglements. ||1||Pause||
Embrace love for the Word of the Guru's Bani.
When the Guru shows His Mercy, pain is destroyed. ||2||
Without the Guru, there is no other place of rest.
The Guru is the Giver, the Guru gives the Name. ||3||
The Guru is the Supreme Lord God; He Himself is the Transcendent Lord.
Twenty-four hours a day, O Nanak, meditate on the Guru. ||4||16||67||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself is the tree, and the branches extending out.
He Himself preserves His own crop. ||1||
Wherever I look, I see that One Lord alone.
Deep within each and every heart, He Himself is contained. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the sun, and the rays emanating from it.
He is concealed, and He is revealed. ||2||
He is said to be of the highest attributes, and without attributes.
Both converge onto His single point. ||3||
Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt and fear.
With my eyes, I perceive the Lord, the embodiment of bliss, to be everywhere. ||4||17||68||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I know nothing of arguments or cleverness.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 042

Day and night, I chant Your Name. ||1||
I am worthless; I have no virtue at all.
God is the Creator, the Cause of all causes. ||1||Pause||
I am foolish, stupid, ignorant and thoughtless;
Your Name is my mind's only hope. ||2||
I have not practiced chanting, deep meditation, self-discipline or good actions;
but within my mind, I have worshipped God's Name. ||3||
I know nothing, and my intellect is inadequate.
Prays Nanak, O God, You are my only Support. ||4||18||69||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
These two words, Har, Har, make up my maalaa.
Continually chanting and reciting this rosary, God has become merciful to me, His humble servant. ||1||
I offer my prayer to the True Guru.
Shower Your Mercy upon me, and keep me safe in Your Sanctuary; please, give me the maalaa, the rosary of Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
One who enshrines this rosary of the Lord's Name within his heart,
is freed of the pains of birth and death. ||2||
The humble being who contemplates the Lord within his heart, and chants the Lord's Name, Har, Har, with his mouth,
never wavers, here or hereafter. ||3||
Says Nanak, one who is imbued with the Name,
goes to the next world with the maalaa of the Lord's Name. ||4||19||70||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
All things belong to Him - let yourself belong to Him as well.
No stain clings to such a humble being. ||1||
The Lord's servant is liberated forever.
Whatever He does, is pleasing to His servant; the way of life of His slave is immaculately pure. ||1||Pause||
One who renounces everything, and enters the Lord's Sanctuary
\- how can Maya cling to him? ||2||
With the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in his mind,
he suffers no anxiety, even in dreams. ||3||
Says Nanak, I have found the Perfect Guru.
My doubts and attachments have been totally obliterated. ||4||20||71||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
When my God is totally pleased with me,
then, tell me, how can suffering or doubt draw near me? ||1||
Continually listening to Your Glory, I live.
I am worthless - save me, O Lord! ||1||Pause||
My suffering has been ended, and my anxiety is forgotten.
I have obtained my reward, chanting the Mantra of the True Guru. ||2||
He is True, and True is His glory.
Remembering, remembering Him in meditation, keep Him clasped to your heart. ||3||
Says Nanak, what action is there left to do,
by one whose mind is filled with the Lord's Name? ||4||21||72||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Sexual desire, anger, and egotism lead to ruin.
Meditating on the Lord, the Lord's humble servants are redeemed. ||1||
The mortals are asleep, intoxicated with the wine of Maya.
The devotees remain awake, imbued with the Lord's meditation. ||1||Pause||
In emotional attachment and doubt, the mortals wander through countless incarnations.
The devotees remain ever-stable, meditating on the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||2||
Bound to household and possessions, the mortals are lost in the deep, dark pit.
The Saints are liberated, knowing the Lord to be near at hand. ||3||
Says Nanak, one who has taken to God's Sanctuary,
obtains peace in this world, and salvation in the world hereafter. ||4||22||73||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 043

Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
You are my waves, and I am Your fish.
You are my Lord and Master; I wait at Your Door. ||1||
You are my Creator, and I am Your servant.
I have taken to Your Sanctuary, O God, most profound and excellent. ||1||Pause||
You are my life, You are my Support.
Beholding You, my heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||
You are my salvation and honor; You make me acceptable.
You are All-powerful, You are my strength. ||3||
Night and day, I chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the treasure of excellence.
This is Nanak's prayer to God. ||4||23||74||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The mourner practices falsehood;
he laughs with glee, while mourning for others. ||1||
Someone has died, while there is singing in someone else's house.
One mourns and bewails, while another laughs with glee. ||1||Pause||
From childhood to old age,
the mortal does not attain his goals, and he comes to regret in the end. ||2||
The world is under the influence of the three qualities.
The mortal is reincarnated, again and again, into heaven and hell. ||3||
Says Nanak, one who is attached to the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
becomes acceptable, and his life becomes fruitful. ||4||24||75||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
She remains asleep, and does not know the news of God.
The day dawns, and then, she regrets. ||1||
Loving the Beloved, the mind is filled with celestial bliss.
You yearn to meet with God, so why do you delay? ||1||Pause||
He came and poured His Ambrosial Nectar into your hands,
but it slipped through your fingers, and fell onto the ground. ||2||
You are burdened with desire, emotional attachment and egotism;
it is not the fault of God the Creator. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the darkness of doubt is dispelled.
O Nanak, the Creator Lord blends us with Himself. ||4||25||76||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I long for the Lotus Feet of my Beloved Lord.
The wretched Messenger of Death has run away from me. ||1||
You enter into my mind, by Your Kind Mercy.
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all diseases are destroyed. ||1||Pause||
Death gives so much pain to others,
but it cannot even come near Your slave. ||2||
My mind thirsts for Your Vision;
in peaceful ease and bliss, I dwell in detachment. ||3||
Hear this prayer of Nanak:
please, infuse Your Name into his heart. ||4||26||77||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My mind is satisfied, and my entanglements have been dissolved.
God has become merciful to me. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saints, everything has turned out well.

The most dreadful desires have been eliminated. ||2||
My Master has given me a gift;
the fire has been extinguished, and my mind is now at peace. ||3||
My search has ended, and my mind is absorbed in celestial bliss.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 044

Nanak has obtained the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||27||78||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Those who are attuned to their Lord and Master
are satisfied and fulfilled with the perfect food. ||1||
The Lord's devotees never run short of anything.
They have plenty to eat, spend, enjoy and give. ||1||Pause||
One who has the Unfathomable Lord of the Universe as his Master
\- how can any mere mortal stand up to him? ||2||
One who is served by the eighteen supernatural powers of the Siddhas
\- grasp his feet, even for an instant. ||3||
That one, upon whom You have showered Your Mercy, O my Lord Master
\- says Nanak, he does not lack anything. ||4||28||79||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
When I meditate on my True Guru,
my mind becomes supremely peaceful. ||1||
The record of my account is erased, and my doubts are dispelled.
Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, His humble servant is blessed with good fortune. ||1||Pause||
When I remember my Lord and Master,
my fears are dispelled, O my friend. ||2||
When I took to Your Protection, O God,
my desires were fulfilled. ||3||
Gazing upon the wonder of Your play, my mind has become encouraged.
Servant Nanak relies on You alone. ||4||29||80||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Night and day, the mouse of time gnaws away at the rope of life.
Falling into the well, the mortal eats the sweet treats of Maya. ||1||
Thinking and planning, the night of the life is passing away.
Thinking of the many pleasures of Maya, the mortal never remembers the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth. ||1||Pause||
Believing the shade of the tree to be permanent, he builds his house beneath it.
But the noose of death is around his neck, and Shakti, the power of Maya, has aimed her arrows at him. ||2||
The sandy shore is being washed away by the waves,
but the fool still believes that place to be permanent. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, chant the Name of the Lord, the King.
Nanak lives by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||30||81||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Du-Tukas 9:
With that, you are engaged in playful sport;
with that, I am joined to you.
With that, everyone longs for you;
without it, no one would even look at your face. ||1||
Where is that detached soul now contained?
Without it, you are miserable. ||1||Pause||
With that, you are the woman of the house;
with that, you are respected.
With that, you are caressed;
without it, you are reduced to dust. ||2||
With that, you have honor and respect;
with that, you have relatives in the world.
With that, you are adorned in every way;
without it, you are reduced to dust. ||3||
That detached soul is neither born, nor dies.
It acts according to the Command of the Lord's Will.
O Nanak, having fashioned the body, the Lord unites the soul with it, and separates them again;
He alone knows His All-powerful creative nature. ||4||31||82||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 045

He does not die, so I do not fear.
He does not perish, so I do not grieve.
He is not poor, so I do not hunger.
He is not in pain, so I do not suffer. ||1||
There is no other Destroyer than Him.
He is my very life, the Giver of life. ||1||Pause||
He is not bound, so I am not in bondage.
He has no occupation, so I have no entanglements.
He has no impurities, so I have no impurities.
He is in ecstasy, so I am always happy. ||2||
He has no anxiety, so I have no cares.
He has no stain, so I have no pollution.
He has no hunger, so I have no thirst.
Since He is immaculately pure, I correspond to Him. ||3||
I am nothing; He is the One and only.
Before and after, He alone exists.
O Nanak, the Guru has taken away my doubts and mistakes;
He and I, joining together, are of the same color. ||4||32||83||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Serve Him in many different ways;
Dedicate your soul, your breath of life and your wealth to Him.
Carry water for Him, and wave the fan over Him - renounce your ego.
Make yourself a sacrifice to Him, time and time again. ||1||
She alone is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to God.
In her company, I may meet Him, O my mother. ||1||Pause||
I am the water-carrier of the slaves of His slaves.
I treasure in my soul the dust of their feet.
By that good destiny inscribed upon my forehead, I obtain their society.
Through His Love, the Lord Master meets me. ||2||
I dedicate all to Him - chanting and meditation, austerity and religious observances.
I offer all to Him - good actions, righteous conduct and incense burning.
Renouncing pride and attachment, I become the dust of the feet of the Saints.
In their society, I behold God with my eyes. ||3||
Each and every moment, I contemplate and adore Him.
Day and night, I serve Him like this.
The Lord of the Universe, the Cherisher of the World, has become merciful;
in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, He forgives us. ||4||33||84||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
In the Love of God, eternal peace is obtained.
In the Love of God, one is not touched by pain.
In the Love of God, the filth of ego is washed away.
In the Love of God, one becomes forever immaculate. ||1||
Listen, O friend: show such love and affection to God,
the Support of the soul, the breath of life, of each and every heart. ||1||Pause||
In the Love of God, all treasures are obtained.
In the Love of God, the Immaculate Naam fills the heart.
In the Love of God, one is eternally embellished.
In the Love of God, all anxiety is ended. ||2||
In the Love of God, one crosses over this terrible world-ocean.
In the Love of God, one does not fear death.
In the Love of God, all are saved.
The Love of God shall go along with you. ||3||
By himself, no one is united, and no one goes astray.
One who is blessed by God's Mercy, joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to You.
O God, You are the Support and the Strength of the Saints. ||4||34||85||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Becoming a king, the mortal wields his royal authority;
oppressing the people, he gathers wealth.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 046

Gathering it and collecting it, he fills his bags.
But God takes it away from him, and gives it to another. ||1||
The mortal is like an unbaked clay pot in water;
indulging in pride and egotism, he crumbles down and dissolves. ||1||Pause||
Being fearless, he becomes unrestrained.
He does not think of the Creator, who is ever with him.
He raises armies, and collects arms.
But when the breath leaves him, he turns to ashes. ||2||
He has lofty palaces, mansions and queens,
elephants and pairs of horses, delighting the mind;
he is blessed with a great family of sons and daughters.
But, engrossed in attachment, the blind fool wastes away to death. ||3||
The One who created him destroys him.
Enjoyments and pleasures are like just a dream.
He alone is liberated, and possesses regal power and wealth,
O Nanak, whom the Lord Master blesses with His Mercy. ||4||35||86||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The mortal is in love with this,
but the more he has, the more he longs for more.
It hangs around his neck, and does not leave him.
But falling at the feet of the True Guru, he is saved. ||1||
I have renounced and discarded Maya, the Enticer of the world.
I have met the Absolute Lord, and congratulations are pouring in. ||1||Pause||
She is so beautiful, she captivates the mind.
On the road, and the beach, at home, in the forest and in the wilderness, she touches us.
She seems so sweet to the mind and body.
But by Guru's Grace, I have seen her to be deceptive. ||2||
Her courtiers are also great deceivers.
They do not spare even their fathers or mothers.
They have enslaved their companions.
By Guru's Grace, I have subjugated them all. ||3||
Now, my mind is filled with bliss;
my fear is gone, and the noose is cut away.
Says Nanak, when I met the True Guru,
I came to dwell within my home in absolute peace. ||4||36||87||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Twenty-four hours a day, he knows the Lord to be near at hand;
he surrenders to the Sweet Will of God.
The One Name is the Support of the Saints;
they remain the dust of the feet of all. ||1||
Listen, to the way of life of the Saints, O my Siblings of Destiny;
their praises cannot be described. ||1||Pause||
Their occupation is the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Kirtan, the Praise of the Lord, the embodiment of bliss, is their rest.
Friends and enemies are one and the same to them.
They know of no other than God. ||2||
They erase millions upon millions of sins.
They dispel suffering; they are givers of the life of the soul.
They are so brave; they are men of their word.
The Saints have enticed Maya herself. ||3||
Their company is cherished even by the gods and the angels.
Blessed is their Darshan, and fruitful is their service.
With his palms pressed together, Nanak offers his prayer:
O Lord, Treasure of Excellence, please bless me with the service of the Saints. ||4||37||88||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
All peace and comforts are in the meditation of the One Name.
All righteous actions of Dharma are in the singing of the Lord's Glorious Praises.
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is so very pure and sacred.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 047

Meeting with them, love for God is embraced. ||1||
By Guru's Grace, bliss is obtained.
Meditating upon Him in remembrance, the mind is illumined; his state and condition cannot be described. ||1||Pause||
Fasts, religious vows, cleansing baths, and worship to Him;
listening to the Vedas, Puraanas, and Shaastras.
Extremely pure is he, and immaculate is his place,
who meditates upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat. ||2||
That humble being becomes renowned all over the world.
Even sinners are purified, by the dust of his feet.
One who has met the Lord, the Lord our King,
his condition and state cannot be described. ||3||
Twenty-four hours a day, with palms pressed together, I meditate;
I yearn to obtain the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of those Holy Saints.
Merge me, the poor one, with You, O Lord;
Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary. ||4||38||89||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Twenty-four hours a day, he takes his cleansing bath in water;
he makes continual offerings to the Lord; he is a true man of wisdom.
He never leaves anything uselessly.
Again and again, he falls at the Lord's Feet. ||1||
Such is the Saalagraam, the stone idol, which I serve;
such is my worship, flower-offerings and divine adoration as well. ||1||Pause||
His bell resounds to the four corners of the world.
His seat is forever in heaven.
His chauri, his fly-brush, waves over all.
His incense is ever-fragrant. ||2||
He is treasured in each and every heart.
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is His Eternal Court.
His Aartee, his lamp-lit worship service, is the Kirtan of His Praises, which brings lasting bliss.
His Greatness is so beautiful, and ever limitless. ||3||
He alone obtains it, who is so pre-ordained;
he takes to the Sanctuary of the Saints' Feet.
I hold in my hands the Saalagraam of the Lord.
Says Nanak, the Guru has given me this Gift. ||4||39||90||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Panch-Pada:
That highway, upon which the water-carrier is plundered
\- that way is far removed from the Saints. ||1||
The True Guru has spoken the Truth.
Your Name, O Lord, is the Way to Salvation; the road of the Messenger of Death is far away. ||1||Pause||
That place, where the greedy toll-collector dwells
\- that path remains far removed from the Lord's humble servant. ||2||
There, where so very many caravans of men are caught,
the Holy Saints remain with the Supreme Lord. ||3||
Chitra and Gupat, the recording angels of the conscious and the unconscious, write the accounts of all mortal beings,
but they cannot even see the Lord's humble devotees. ||4||
Says Nanak, one whose True Guru is Perfect
\- the unblown bugles of ecstasy vibrate for him. ||5||40||91||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Du-Pada 1:
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Naam is learned;
all desires and tasks are fulfilled.
My thirst has been quenched, and I am satiated with the Lord's Praise.
I live by chanting and meditating upon the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth. ||1||
I have entered the Sanctuary of the Creator, the Cause of all causes.
By Guru's Grace, I have entered the home of celestial bliss. Darkness is dispelled, and the moon of wisdom has risen. ||1||Pause||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 048

My treasure-house is overflowing with rubies and jewels;
I meditate on the Formless Lord, and so they never run short.
How rare is that humble being, who drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Word of the Shabad.
O Nanak, he attains the state of highest dignity. ||2||41||92||
Aasaa, Seventh House, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate continually on the Name of the Lord within your heart.
Thus you shall save all your companions and associates. ||1||
My Guru is always with me, near at hand.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on Him, I cherish Him forever. ||1||Pause||
Your actions seem so sweet to me.
Nanak begs for the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||42||93||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The world is saved by the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The Name of the Lord is the Support of the mind. ||1||
The Saints worship and adore the Lotus Feet of the Divine Guru;
they love the Beloved Lord. ||1||Pause||
She who has such good destiny written upon her forehead,
says Nanak, is blessed with the eternal happy marriage with the Lord. ||2||43||94||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Order of my Husband Lord seems so sweet to me.
My Husband Lord has driven out the one who was my rival.
My Beloved Husband has decorated me, His happy soul-bride.
He has quieted the burning thirst of my mind. ||1||
It is good that I submitted to the Will of my Beloved Lord.
I have realized celestial peace and poise within this home of mine. ||Pause||
I am the hand-maiden, the attendant of my Beloved Lord.
He is eternal and imperishable, inaccessible and infinite.
Holding the fan, sitting at His Feet, I wave it over my Beloved.
The five demons who tortured me have run away. ||2||
I am not from a noble family, and I am not beautiful.
What do I know? Why am I pleasing to my Beloved?
I am a poor orphan, destitute and dishonored.
My Husband took me in, and made me His queen. ||3||
When I saw my Beloved's face before me,
I became so happy and peaceful; my married life was blessed.
Says Nanak, my desires are fulfilled.
The True Guru has united me with God, the treasure of excellence. ||4||1||95||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
A frown creases her forehead, and her look is evil.
Her speech is bitter, and her tongue is rude.
She is always hungry, and she believes her Husband to be far away. ||1||
Such is Maya, the woman, which the One Lord has created.
She is devouring the whole world, but the Guru has saved me, O my Siblings of Destiny. ||Pause||
Administering her poisons, she has overcome the whole world.
She has bewitched Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
Only those Gurmukhs who are attuned to the Naam are blessed. ||2||
Performing fasts, religious observances and atonements, the mortals have grown weary.
They wander over the entire planet, on pilgrimages to the banks of sacred rivers.
But they alone are saved, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||3||
Attached to Maya, the whole world is in bondage.
The foolish self-willed manmukhs are consumed by their egotism.
Taking me by the arm, Guru Nanak has saved me. ||4||2||96||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Everything is painful, when one forgets the Lord Master.
Here and hereafter, such a mortal is useless. ||1||
The Saints are satisfied, meditating on the Lord, Har, Har.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 049

Bestowing Your Mercy, God, You attach us to Your Name; all peace comes by Your Will. ||Pause||
The Lord is Ever-present; one who deems Him to be far away, dies again and again, repenting. ||2||
The mortals do not remember the One, who has given them everything.
Engrossed in such terrible corruption, their days and nights waste away. ||3||
Says Nanak, meditate in remembrance of the One Lord God.
Salvation is obtained, in the Shelter of the Perfect Guru. ||4||3||97||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind and body are totally rejuvenated.
All sins and sorrows are washed away. ||1||
How blessed is that day, O my Siblings of Destiny,
when the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung, and the supreme status is obtained. ||Pause||
Worshipping the feet of the Holy Saints,
troubles and hatred are eliminated from the mind. ||2||
Meeting with the Perfect Guru, conflict is ended,
and the five demons are totally subdued. ||3||
One whose mind is filled with the Name of the Lord,
O Nanak - I am a sacrifice to him. ||4||4||98||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
O singer, sing of the One,
who is the Support of the soul, the body and the breath of life.
Serving Him, all peace is obtained.
You shall no longer go to any other. ||1||
My Blissful Lord Master is forever in bliss; meditate continually and forever, on the Lord, the treasure of excellence.
I am a sacrifice to the Beloved Saints; by their kind favor, God comes to dwell in the mind. ||Pause||
His gifts are never exhausted.
In His subtle way, He easily absorbs all.
His benevolence cannot be erased.
So enshrine that True Lord within your mind. ||2||
His house is filled with all sorts of articles;
God's servants never suffer pain.
Holding to His Support, the state of fearless dignity is obtained.
With each and every breath, sing of the Lord, the treasure of excellence. ||3||
He is not far from us, wherever we go.
When He shows His Mercy, we obtain the Lord, Har, Har.
I offer this prayer to the Perfect Guru.
Nanak begs for the treasure of the Lord's Name. ||4||5||99||

I have obtained the Perfect Guru, O my Siblings of Destiny.
All illness, sorrows and sufferings are dispelled, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||Pause||
The feet of the Guru abide within my heart;
I have received all the fruits of my heart's desires.
The fire is extinguished, and I am totally peaceful.
Showering His Mercy, the Guru has given this gift. ||2||
The Guru has given shelter to the shelterless.
The Guru has given honor to the dishonored.
Shattering his bonds, the Guru has saved His servant.
I taste with my tongue the Ambrosial Bani of His Word. ||3||
By great good fortune, I worship the Guru's feet.
Forsaking everything, I have obtained God's Sanctuary.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 050

That humble being, O Nanak, unto whom the Guru grants His Mercy, is forever enraptured. ||4||6||100||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The True Guru has truly given a child.
The long-lived one has been born to this destiny.
He came to acquire a home in the womb,
and his mother's heart is so very glad. ||1||
A son is born - a devotee of the Lord of the Universe.
This pre-ordained destiny has been revealed to all. ||Pause||
In the tenth month, by the Lord's Order, the baby has been born.
Sorrow is dispelled, and great joy has ensued.
The companions blissfully sing the songs of the Guru's Bani.
This is pleasing to the Lord Master. ||2||
The vine has grown, and shall last for many generations.
The Power of the Dharma has been firmly established by the Lord.
That which my mind wishes for, the True Guru has granted.
I have become carefree, and I fix my attention on the One Lord. ||3||
As the child places so much faith in his father,
I speak as it pleases the Guru to have me speak.
This is not a hidden secret;
Guru Nanak, greatly pleased, has bestowed this gift. ||4||7||101||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Giving His Hand, the Perfect Guru has protected the child.
The glory of His servant has become manifest. ||1||
I contemplate the Guru, the Guru; I meditate on the Guru, the Guru.
I offer my heart-felt prayer to the Guru, and it is answered. ||Pause||
I have taken to the Sanctuary of the True Divine Guru.
The service of His servant has been fulfilled. ||2||
He has preserved my soul, body, youth and breath of life.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru. ||3||8||102||
Aasaa, Eighth House, Kaafee, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am Your purchased slave, O True Lord Master.
My soul and body, and all of this, everything is Yours. ||1||
You are the honor of the dishonored. O Master, in You I place my trust.
Without the True One, any other support is false - know this well. ||1||Pause||
Your Command is infinite; no one can find its limit.
One who meets with the Perfect Guru, walks in the Way of the Lord's Will. ||2||
Cunning and cleverness are of no use.
That which the Lord Master gives, by the Pleasure of His Will - that is pleasing to me. ||3||
One may perform tens of thousands of actions, but attachment to things is not satisfied.
Servant Nanak has made the Naam his Support. He has renounced other entanglements. ||4||1||103||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have pursued all pleasures, but none is as great as the Lord.
By the Pleasure of the Guru's Will, the True Lord Master is obtained. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my Guru; I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him.
Please, grant me this one blessing, that I may never, even for an instant, forget Your Name. ||1||Pause||
How very fortunate are those who have the wealth of the Lord deep within the heart.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 051

They escape from the great noose of death; they are permeated with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
How can I chant the Glorious Praises of the Guru? The Guru is the ocean of Truth and clear understanding.
He is the Perfect Transcendent Lord, from the very beginning, and throughout the ages. ||3||
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, forever and ever, my mind is filled with the Love of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Guru is my soul, my breath of life, and wealth; O Nanak, He is with me forever. ||4||2||104||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
If the Invisible and Infinite Lord dwells within my mind, even for a moment,
then all my pains, troubles, and diseases vanish. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my Lord Master.
Meditating on Him, a great joy wells up within my mind and body. ||1||Pause||
I have heard only a little bit of news about the True Lord Master.
I have obtained the peace of all peace, O my mother; I cannot estimate its worth. ||2||
He is so beautiful to my eyes; beholding Him, I have been bewitched.
I am worthless, O my mother; He Himself has attached me to the hem of His robe. ||3||
He is beyond the world of the Vedas, the Koran and the Bible.
The Supreme King of Nanak is immanent and manifest. ||4||3||105||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Tens of thousands of devotees worship and adore You, chanting, “Beloved, Beloved.”
How shall You unite me, the worthless and corrupt soul, with Yourself. ||1||
You are my Support, O Merciful God, Lord of the Universe, Sustainer of the World.
You are the Master of all; the entire creation is Yours. ||1||Pause||
You are the constant help and support of the Saints, who behold You Ever-present.
Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, shall die, engulfed in sorrow and pain. ||2||
Those servants, who lovingly perform the Lord's service, are freed from the cycle of reincarnation.
What shall be the fate of those who forget the Naam? ||3||
As are the cattle which have strayed, so is the entire world.
O God, please cut away Nanak's bonds, and unite him with Yourself. ||4||4||106||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Forget all other things, and dwell upon the Lord alone.
Lay aside your false pride, and dedicate your mind and body to Him. ||1||
Twenty-four hours a day, praise the Creator Lord.
I live by Your bountiful gifts - please, shower me with Your Mercy! ||1||Pause||
So, do that work, by which your face shall be made radiant.
He alone becomes attached to the Truth, O Lord, unto whom You give it. ||2||
So build and adorn that house, which shall never be destroyed.
Enshrine the One Lord within your consciousness; He shall never die. ||3||
The Lord is dear to those, who are pleasing to the Will of God.
By Guru's Grace, Nanak describes the indescribable. ||4||5||107||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
What are they like - those who do not forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord?
Know that there is absolutely no difference; they are exactly like the Lord. ||1||
The mind and body are enraptured, meeting with You, O Lord.
Peace is obtained, by the favor of the Lord's humble servant; all pains are taken away. ||1||Pause||
As many as are the continents of the world, so many have been saved.
Those, in whose minds You Yourself dwell, O Lord, are the perfect devotees. ||2||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 052

Those whom You approve, are approved.
Such a celebrated and honored person is known everywhere. ||3||
Day and night, with every breath to worship and adore the Lord
\- please, O True Supreme King, fulfill this, Nanak's desire. ||4||6||108||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He, my Lord Master, is fully pervading all places.
He is the One Lord Master, the roof over our heads; there is no other than Him. ||1||
As it pleases Your Will, please save me, O Savior Lord.
Without You, my eyes see no other at all. ||1||Pause||
God Himself is the Cherisher; He takes care of each and every heart.
That person, within whose mind You Yourself dwell, never forgets You. ||2||
He does that which is pleasing to Himself.
He is known as the help and support of His devotees, throughout the ages. ||3||
Chanting and meditating up the Lord's Name, the mortal never comes to regret anything.
O Nanak, I thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; please, fulfill my desire, O Lord. ||4||7||109||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Why are you sleeping, and forgetting the Name, O careless and foolish mortal?
So many have been washed away and carried off by this river of life. ||1||
O mortal, get aboard the boat of the Lord's Lotus Feet, and cross over.
Twenty-four hours a day, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
You may enjoy various pleasures, but they are useless without the Name.
Without devotion to the Lord, you shall die in sorrow, again and again. ||2||
You may dress and eat and apply scented oils to your body,
but without the meditative remembrance of the Lord, your body shall surely turn to dust, and you shall have to depart. ||3||
How very treacherous is this world-ocean; how very few realize this!
Salvation rests in the Lord's Sanctuary; O Nanak, this is your pre-ordained destiny. ||4||8||110||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
No one is anyone's companion; why take any pride in others?
With the Support of the One Name, this terrible world-ocean is crossed over. ||1||
You are the True Support of me, the poor mortal, O my Perfect True Guru.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, my mind is encouraged. ||1||Pause||
Royal powers, wealth, and worldly involvements are of no use at all.
The Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is my Support; this wealth is everlasting. ||2||
As many as are the pleasures of Maya, so many are the shadows they leave.
The Gurmukhs sing of the Naam, the treasure of peace. ||3||
You are the True Lord, the treasure of excellence; O God, You are deep and unfathomable.
The Lord Master is the hope and support of Nanak's mind. ||4||9||111||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Remembering Him, suffering is removed, and celestial peace is obtained.
Night and day, with your palms pressed together, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
He alone is Nanak's God, unto whom all beings belong.
He is totally pervading everywhere, the Truest of the True. ||1||Pause||
Inwardly and outwardly, He is my companion and my helper; He is the One to be realized.
Adoring Him, my mind is cured of all its ailments. ||2||
The Savior Lord is infinite; He saves us from the fire of the womb.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 053

The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is soothing and cool; remembering it in meditation, the inner fire is quenched. ||3||
Peace, poise, and immense bliss, O Nanak, are obtained, when one becomes the dust of the feet of the humble servants of the Lord.
All of one's affairs are perfectly resolved, meeting with the Perfect Guru. ||4||10||112||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe is the treasure of excellence; He is known only to the Gurmukh.
When He shows His Mercy and Kindness, we revel in the Lord's Love. ||1||
Come, O Saints - let us join together and speak the Sermon of the Lord.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and ignore the criticism of others. ||1||Pause||
I live by chanting and meditating on the Naam, and so I obtain immense bliss.
Attachment to the world is useless and vain; it is false, and perishes in the end. ||2||
How rare are those who embrace love for the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Blessed and beautiful is that mouth, which meditates on the Lord. ||3||
The pains of birth, death and reincarnation are erased by meditating on the Lord.
That alone is Nanak's joy, which is pleasing to God. ||4||11||113||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Come, O friends: let us meet together and enjoy all the tastes and flavors.
Let us join together and chant the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and so wipe away our sins. ||1||
Reflect upon the essence of reality, O Saintly beings, and no troubles shall afflict you.
All of the thieves shall be destroyed, as the Gurmukhs remain wakeful. ||1||Pause||
Take wisdom and humility as your supplies, and burn away the poison of pride.
True is that shop, and perfect the transaction; deal only in the merchandise of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
They alone are accepted and approved, who dedicate their souls, bodies and wealth.
Those who are pleasing to their God, celebrate in happiness. ||3||
Those fools, who drink in the wine of evil-mindedness, become the husbands of prostitutes.
But those who are imbued with the sublime essence of the Lord, O Nanak, are intoxicated with the Truth. ||4||12||114||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I made the effort; I did it, and made a beginning.
I live by chanting and meditating on the Naam. The Guru has implanted this Mantra within me. ||1||
I fall at the Feet of the True Guru, who has dispelled my doubts.
Bestowing His Mercy, God has dressed me, and decorated me with the Truth. ||1||Pause||
Taking me by the hand, He made me His own, through the True Order of His Command.
That gift which God gave to me, is perfect greatness. ||2||
Forever and ever, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and chant the Name of the Destroyer of ego.
My vows have been honored, by the Grace of God and the True Guru, who has showered His Mercy. ||3||
The Perfect Guru has given the wealth of the Naam, and the profit of singing the Lord's Glorious Praises.
The Saints are the traders, O Nanak, and the Infinite Lord God is their Banker. ||4||13||115||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
One who has You as His Master, O God, is blessed with great destiny.
He is happy, and forever at peace; his doubts and fears are all dispelled. ||1||
I am the slave of the Lord of the Universe; my Master is the greatest of all.
He is the Creator, the Cause of causes; He is my True Guru. ||1||Pause||
There is no other whom I should fear.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 054

Serving the Guru, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is obtained, and the impassable world-ocean is crossed over. ||2||
By Your Glance of Grace, peace is obtained, and the treasure fills the mind.
That servant, unto whom You bestow Your Mercy, is approved and accepted. ||3||
How rare is that person who drinks in the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord's Kirtan.
Nanak has obtained the commodity of the One Name; he lives by chanting and meditating on it within his heart. ||4||14||116||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I am God's maid-servant; He is the highest of all.
All things, big and small, are said to belong to Him. ||1||
I surrender my soul, my breath of life, and my wealth, to my Lord Master.
Through His Name, I become radiant; I am known as His slave. ||1||Pause||
You are Carefree, the Embodiment of Bliss. Your Name is a gem, a jewel.
One who has You as her Master, is satisfied, satiated and happy forever. ||2||
O my companions and fellow maidens, please implant that balanced understanding within me.
Serve the Holy Saints lovingly, and find the treasure of the Lord. ||3||
All are servants of the Lord Master, and all call Him their own.
She alone dwells in peace, O Nanak, whom the Lord adorns. ||4||15||117||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Become the servant of the Saints, and learn this way of life.
Of all virtues, the most sublime virtue is to see your Husband Lord near at hand. ||1||
So, dye this mind of yours with the color of the Lord's Love.
Renounce cleverness and cunning, and know that the Sustainer of the world is with you. ||1||Pause||
Whatever your Husband Lord says, accept that, and make it your decoration.
Forget the love of duality, and chew upon this betel leaf. ||2||
Make the Word of the Guru's Shabad your lamp, and let your bed be Truth.
Twenty-four hours a day, stand with your palms pressed together, and the Lord, your King, shall meet you. ||3||
She alone is cultured and embellished, and she alone is of incomparable beauty.
She alone is the happy soul-bride, O Nanak, who is pleasing to the Creator Lord. ||4||16||118||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
As long as there are doubts in the mind, the mortal staggers and falls.
The Guru removed my doubts, and I have obtained my place of rest. ||1||
Those quarrelsome enemies have been overcome, through the Guru.
I have now escaped from them, and they have run away from me. ||1||Pause||
He is concerned with ‘mine and yours’, and so he is held in bondage.
When the Guru dispelled my ignorance, then the noose of death was cut away from my neck. ||2||
As long as he does not understand the Command of God's Will, he remains miserable.
Meeting with the Guru, he comes to recognize God's Will, and then, he becomes happy. ||3||
I have no enemies and no adversaries; no one is wicked to me.
That servant, who performs the Lord's service, O Nanak, is the slave of the Lord Master. ||4||17||119||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Peace, celestial poise and absolute bliss are obtained, singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
Bestowing His Name, the True Guru removes the evil omens. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my Guru; forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 055

I am a sacrifice to the Guru; meeting Him, I am absorbed into the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Good omens and bad omens affect those who do not keep the Lord in the mind.
The Messenger of Death does not approach those who are pleasing to the Lord God. ||2||
Donations to charity, meditation and penance - above all of them is the Naam.
One who chants with his tongue the Name of the Lord, Har, Har - his works are brought to perfect completion. ||3||
His fears are removed, and his doubts and attachments are gone; he sees none other than God.
O Nanak, the Supreme Lord God preserves him, and no pain or sorrow afflicts him any longer. ||4||18||120||
Aasaa, Ninth House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Contemplating Him within my consciousness, I obtain total peace; but hereafter, will I be pleasing to Him or not?
There is only One Giver; all others are beggars. Who else can we turn to? ||1||
When I beg from others, I am ashamed.
The One Lord Master is the Supreme King of all; who else is equal to Him? ||1||Pause||
Standing up and sitting down, I cannot live without Him. I search and search for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
Even Brahma and the sages Sanak, Sanandan, Sanaatan and Sanat Kumar, find it difficult to obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||2||
He is unapproachable and unfathomable; His wisdom is deep and profound; His value cannot be appraised.
I have taken to the Sanctuary of the True Lord, the Primal Being, and I meditate on the True Guru. ||3||
God, the Lord Master, has become kind and compassionate; He has cut the noose of death away from my neck.
Says Nanak, now that I have obtained the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I shall not have to be reincarnated again. ||4||1||121||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Inwardly, I sing His Praises, and outwardly, I sing His Praises; I sing His Praises while awake and asleep.
I am a trader in the Name of the Lord of the Universe; He has given it to me as my supplies, to carry with me. ||1||
I have forgotten and forsaken other things.
The Perfect Guru has given me the Gift of the Naam; this alone is my Support. ||1||Pause||
I sing His Praises while suffering, and I sing His Praises while I am at peace as well. I contemplate Him while I walk along the Path.
The Guru has implanted the Naam within my mind, and my thirst has been quenched. ||2||
I sing His Praises during the day, and I sing His Praises during the night; I sing them with each and every breath.
In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, this faith is established, that the Lord is with us, in life and in death. ||3||
Bless servant Nanak with this gift, O God, that he may obtain, and enshrine in his heart, the dust of the feet of the Saints.
Hear the Lord's Sermon with your ears, and behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan with your eyes; place your forehead upon the Guru's Feet. ||4||2||122||

That which you believe to be permanent, is a guest here for only a few days.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 056

Children, wives, homes, and all possessions - attachment to all of these is false. ||1||
O mind, why do you burst out laughing?
See with your eyes, that these things are only mirages. So earn the profit of meditation on the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
It is like the clothes which you wear on your body - they wear off in a few days.
How long can you run upon a wall? Ultimately, you come to its end. ||2||
It is like salt, preserved in its container; when it is put into water, it dissolves.
When the Order of the Supreme Lord God comes, the soul arises, and departs in an instant. ||3||
O mind, your steps are numbered, your moments spent sitting are numbered, and the breaths you are to take are numbered.
Sing forever the Praises of the Lord, O Nanak, and you shall be saved, under the Shelter of the Feet of the True Guru. ||4||1||123||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
That which was upside-down has been set upright; the deadly enemies and adversaries have become friends.
In the darkness, the jewel shines forth, and the impure understanding has become pure. ||1||
When the Lord of the Universe became merciful,
I found peace, wealth and the fruit of the Lord's Name; I have met the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
No one knew me, the miserable miser, but now, I have become famous all over the world.
Before, no one would even sit with me, but now, all worship my feet. ||2||
I used to wander in search of pennies, but now, all the desires of my mind are satisfied.
I could not bear even one criticism, but now, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am cooled and soothed. ||3||
What Glorious Virtues of the Inaccessible, Unfathomable, Profound Lord can one mere tongue describe?
Please, make me the slave of the slave of Your slaves; servant Nanak seeks the Lord's Sanctuary. ||4||2||124||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
O fool, you are so slow to earn your profits, and so quick to run up losses.
You do not purchase the inexpensive merchandise; O sinner, you are tied to your debts. ||1||
O True Guru, You are my only hope.
Your Name is the Purifier of sinners, O Supreme Lord God; You are my only Shelter. ||1||Pause||
Listening to the evil talk, you are caught up in it, but you are hesitant to chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
You are delighted by slanderous talk; your understanding is corrupt. ||2||
Others' wealth, others' wives and the slander of others - eating the uneatable, you have gone crazy.
You have not enshrined love for the True Faith of Dharma; hearing the Truth, you are enraged. ||3||
O God, Merciful to the meek, Compassionate Lord Master, Your Name is the Support of Your devotees.
Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary; O God, make him Your Own, and preserve his honor. ||4||3||125||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl
: They are attached to falsehood; clinging to the transitory, they are trapped in emotional attachment to Maya.
Wherever they go, they do not think of the Lord; they are blinded by intellectual egotism. ||1||
O mind, O renunciate, why don't you adore Him?
You dwell in that flimsy chamber, with all the sins of corruption. ||1||Pause||
Crying out, “Mine, mine”, your days and nights pass away; moment by moment, your life is running out.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 057

The sweet flavors tempt you, and you are occupied by your false and filthy business. ||2||
Your senses are beguiled by sensual pleasures of sex, by anger, greed and emotional attachment.
The All-powerful Architect of Destiny has ordained that you shall be reincarnated over and over again. ||3||
When the Destroyer of the pains of the poor becomes merciful, then, as Gurmukh, you shall find absolute peace.
Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord, day and night, and all your sickness shall be banished. ||4||
Meditate in this way, O Siblings of Destiny, on the Lord, the Architect of Destiny.
The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful; He has removed the pains of birth and death. ||1||Second Pause||4||4||126||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
For a moment of sexual pleasure, you shall suffer in pain for millions of days.
For an instant, you may savor pleasure, but afterwards, you shall regret it, again and again. ||1||
O blind man, meditate on the Lord, the Lord, your King.
Your day is drawing near. ||1||Pause||
You are deceived, beholding with your eyes, the bitter melon and swallow-wort.
But, like the companionship of a poisonous snake, so is the desire for another's spouse. ||2||
For the sake of your enemy, you commit sins, while you neglect the reality of your faith.
Your friendship is with those who abandon you, and you are angry with your friends. ||3||
The entire world is entangled in this way; he alone is saved, who has the Perfect Guru.
Says Nanak, I have crossed over the terrifying world-ocean; my body has become sanctified. ||4||5||127||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl Dupadas:
O Lord, You behold whatever we do in secrecy; the fool may stubbornly deny it.
By his own actions, he is tied down, and in the end, he regrets and repents. ||1||
My God knows, ahead of time, all things.
Deceived by doubt, you may hide your actions, but in the end, you shall have to confess the secrets of your mind. ||1||Pause||
Whatever they are attached to, they remain joined to that. What can any mere mortal do?
Please, forgive me, O Supreme Lord Master. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||2||6||128||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself preserves His servants; He causes them to chant His Name.
Wherever the business and affairs of His servants are, there the Lord hurries to be. ||1||
The Lord appears near at hand to His servant.
Whatever the servant asks of his Lord and Master, immediately comes to pass. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice to that servant, who is pleasing to his God.
Hearing of his glory, the mind is rejuvenated; Nanak comes to touch his feet. ||2||7||129||
Aasaa, Eleventh House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The actor displays himself in many disguises, but he remains just as he is.
The soul wanders through countless incarnations in doubt, but it does not come to dwell in peace. ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 058

O Saints, my friends and companions, without the Lord, Har, Har, you shall perish.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and win this precious treasure of human life. ||1||Pause||
God has created Maya of the three qualities; tell me, how can it be crossed over?
The whirlpool is awesome and unfathomable; only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad is one carried across. ||2||
Searching and searching endlessly, seeking and deliberating, Nanak has realized the true essence of reality.
Meditating on the invaluable treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the jewel of the mind is satisfied. ||3||1||130||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Dupadas:
By Guru's Grace, He dwells within my mind; whatever I ask for, I receive.
This mind is satisfied with the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; it does not go out, anywhere, anymore. ||1||
My Lord and Master is the highest of all; night and day, I sing the Glories of His Praises.
In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes; through Him, I frighten you. ||1||Pause||
When I behold my God, my Lord and Master, I do not pay any attention to any other.
God Himself has adorned servant Nanak; his doubts and fears have been dispelled, and he writes the account of the Lord. ||2||2||131||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The four castes and social classes, and the preachers with the six Shaastras on their finger-tips,
the beautiful, the refined, the shapely and the wise - the five passions have enticed and beguiled them all. ||1||
Who has seized and conquered the five powerful fighters? Is there anyone strong enough?
He alone, who conquers and defeats the five demons, is perfect in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||1||Pause||
They are so awesome and great; they cannot be controlled, and they do not run away. Their army is mighty and unyielding.
Says Nanak, that humble being who is under the protection of the Saadh Sangat, crushes those terrible demons. ||2||3||132||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Sublime Sermon of the Lord is the best thing for the soul. All other tastes are insipid. ||1||Pause||
The worthy beings, heavenly singers, silent sages and the knowers of the six Shaastras proclaim that nothing else is worthy of consideration. ||1||
It is the cure for evil passions, unique, unequalled and peace-giving; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, drink it in. ||2||4||133||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My Beloved has brought forth a river of nectar. The Guru has not held it back from my mind, even for an instant. ||1||Pause||
Beholding it, and touching it, I am sweetened and delighted. It is imbued with the Creator's Love. ||1||
Chanting it even for a moment, I rise to the Guru; meditating on it, one is not trapped by the Messenger of Death. The Lord has placed it as a garland around Nanak's neck, and within his heart. ||2||5||134||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is exalted and sublime. ||Pause||
Every day, hour and moment, I continually sing and speak of Govind, Govind, the Lord of the Universe. ||1||
Walking, sitting and sleeping, I chant the Lord's Praises; I treasure His Feet in my mind and body. ||2||
I am so small, and You are so great, O Lord and Master; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||3||6||135||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 059

Raag Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Twelfth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Renounce all your cleverness and remember the Supreme, Formless Lord God.
Without the One True Name, everything appears as dust. ||1||
Know that God is always with you.
By Guru's Grace, one understands, and is imbued with the Love of the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
Seek the Shelter of the One All-powerful Lord; there is no other place of rest.
The vast and terrifying world-ocean is crossed over, singing continually the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Birth and death are overcome, and one does not have to suffer in the City of Death.
He alone obtains the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, unto whom God shows His Mercy. ||3||
The One Lord is my Anchor and Support; the One Lord alone is the power of my mind.
O Nanak, joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on Him; without the Lord, there is no other at all. ||4||1||136||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The soul, the mind, the body and the breath of life belong to God. He has given all tastes and pleasures.
He is the Friend of the poor, the Giver of life, the Protector of those who seek His Sanctuary. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Here and hereafter, He is our Helper and Companion; embrace love and affection for the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
They meditate on the Vedas and the Shaastras, to swim across the world-ocean.
The many religious rituals, good deeds of karma and Dharmic worship - above all of these is the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Sexual desire, anger, and egotism depart, meeting with the Divine True Guru.
Implant the Naam within, perform devotional worship to the Lord and serve God - this is good. ||3||
I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet, O Merciful Lord; You are the Honor of the dishonored.
You are the Support of my soul, my breath of life; O God, You are Nanak's strength. ||4||2||137||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He wavers and falters, and suffers such great pain, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The profit of the sublime essence of the Lord of the Universe is obtained, by the Love of the One Supreme Lord God. ||1||
Chant continually the Name of the Lord.
With each and every breath, meditate on God, and renounce other love. ||1||Pause||
God is the Doer, the All-powerful Cause of causes; He Himself is the Giver of life.
So renounce all your cleverness, and meditate on God, twenty-four hours a day. ||2||
He is our best friend and companion, our help and support; He is lofty, inaccessible and infinite.
Enshrine His Lotus Feet within your heart; He is the Support of the soul. ||3||
Show Your Mercy, O Supreme Lord God, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises.
Total peace, and the greatest greatness, O Nanak, are obtained by living to chant the Name of the Lord. ||4||3||138||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I make the effort, as You cause me to do, my Lord and Master, to behold You in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
I am imbued with the color of the Love of the Lord, Har, Har; God Himself has colored me in His Love. ||1||
I chant the Lord's Name within my mind.
Bestow Your Mercy, and dwell within my heart; please, become my Helper. ||1||Pause||
Listening continually to Your Name, O Beloved God, I yearn to behold You.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 060

Please, be kind to me - I am just a worm. This is my object and purpose. ||2||
My body and wealth are Yours; You are my God - nothing is in my power.
As You keep me, so do I live; I eat what You give me. ||3||
The sins of countless incarnations are washed away, by bathing in the dust of the Lord's humble servants.
By loving devotional worship, doubt and fear depart; O Nanak, the Lord is Ever-present. ||4||4||139||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Blessed Vision of Your Darshan is unapproachable and incomprehensible; he alone obtains it, who has such good destiny recorded upon his forehead.
The Merciful Lord God has bestowed His Mercy, and the True Guru has granted the Lord's Name. ||1||
The Divine Guru is the Saving Grace in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
Even those fools and idiots, stained with feces and urine, have all taken to Your service. ||1||Pause||
You Yourself are the Creator, who established the entire world. You are contained in all.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma is wonder-struck, at the sight of everyone falling at the Lord's Feet. ||2||
The Golden Age of Sat Yuga, the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga, and the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga are good; but the best is the Dark Age, the Iron Age, of Kali Yuga.
As we act, so are the rewards we receive; no one can take the place of another. ||3||
O Dear Lord, whatever Your devotees ask for, You do. This is Your Way, Your very nature.
With my palms pressed together, O Nanak, I beg for this gift; Lord, please bless Your Saints with Your Vision. ||4||5||140||
Raag Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Thirteenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O True Guru, by Your Words,
even the worthless have been saved. ||1||Pause||
Even the most argumentative, vicious and indecent people, have been purified in Your company. ||1||
Those who have wandered in reincarnation, and those who have been consigned to hell - even their families have been redeemed. ||2||
Those whom no one knew, and those whom no one respected - even they have become famous and respected at the Court of the Lord. ||3||
What praise, and what greatness should I attribute to You? Nanak is a sacrifice to You, each and every moment. ||4||1||141||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The crazy people are asleep. ||1||Pause||
They are intoxicated with attachment to their families and sensory pleasures; they are held in the grip of falsehood. ||1||
The false desires, and the dream-like delights and pleasures - these, the self-willed manmukhs call true. ||2||
The wealth of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is with them, but they do not find even a tiny bit of its mystery. ||3||
By Your Grace, O Lord, You save those, who take to the Sanctuary of the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||4||2||142||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Tipadas:
I seek the Love of my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
Gold, jewels, giant pearls and rubies - I have no need for them. ||1||
Imperial power, fortunes, royal command and mansions

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 061

\- I have no desire for these. ||2||
The Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet, and dedication to the Saints
\- these bring me peace and pleasure.
O Nanak, my burning fire has been put out,
obtaining the Love of the Beloved. ||3||3||143||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Guru has revealed Him to my eyes. ||1||Pause||
Here and there, in each and every heart, and each and every being, You, O Fascinating Lord, You exist. ||1||
You are the Creator, the Cause of causes, the Support of the earth; You are the One and only, Beauteous Lord. ||2||
Meeting the Saints, and beholding the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, Nanak is a sacrifice to them; he sleeps in absolute peace. ||3||4||144||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is priceless.
It brings peace and poise. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is my Companion and Helper; He shall not forsake me or leave me. He is unfathomable and unequalled. ||1||
He is my Beloved, my brother, father and mother; He is the Support of His devotees. ||2||
The Invisible Lord is seen through the Guru; O Nanak, this is the wondrous play of the Lord. ||3||5||145||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Please help me sustain my devotion.
O Lord Master, I have come to You. ||1||Pause||
With the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, life becomes fruitful. Lord, please place Your Feet within my heart. ||1||
This is liberation, and this is the best way of life; please, keep me in the Society of the Saints. ||2||
Meditating on the Naam, I am absorbed in celestial peace; O Nanak, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||6||146||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Feet of my Lord and Master are so Beautiful!
The Lord's Saints obtain them. ||1||Pause||
They eradicate their self-conceit and serve the Lord; drenched in His Love, they sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||
They place their hopes in Him, and they thirst for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Nothing else is pleasing to them. ||2||
This is Your Mercy, Lord; what can Your poor creatures do? Nanak is devoted, a sacrifice to You. ||3||7||147||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Remember the One Lord in meditation within your mind. ||1||Pause||
Meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and enshrine Him within your heart. Without Him there is no other. ||1||
Entering God's Sanctuary, all rewards are obtained, and all pains are taken away. ||2||
He is the Giver of all beings, the Architect of Destiny; O Nanak, He is contained in each and every heart. ||3||8||148||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
One who forgets the Lord is dead. ||1||Pause||
One who meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, obtains all rewards. That person becomes happy. ||1||
One who calls himself a king, and acts in ego and pride, is caught by his doubts, like a parrot in a trap. ||2||
Says Nanak, one who meets the True Guru, becomes permanent and immortal. ||3||9||149||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Fourteenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
That love is forever fresh and new,
which is for the Beloved Lord. ||1||Pause||
One who is pleasing to God shall not be reincarnated again.
He remains absorbed in the loving devotional worship of the Lord, in the Love of the Lord. ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 062

He is blended with God, by dedicating his mind to Him.
Bless Nanak with Your Name, O Lord - please, shower Your Mercy upon him! ||2||1||150||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Please, come to me, O Beloved Lord; without You, no one can comfort me. ||1||Pause||
One may read the Simritees and the Shaastras, and perform all sorts of religious rituals; and yet, without the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, God, there is no peace at all. ||1||
People have grown weary of observing fasts, vows and rigorous self-discipline; Nanak abides with God, in the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||2||2||151||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Fifteenth House, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He sleeps, intoxicated by corruption and Maya; he does not come to realize or understand.
Seizing him by the hair, the Messenger of Death pulls him up; then, he comes to his senses. ||1||
Those who are attached to the poison of greed and sin grab at the wealth of others; they only bring pain on themselves.
They are intoxicated by their pride in those things which shall be destroyed in an instant; those demons do not understand. ||1||Pause||
The Vedas, the Shaastras and the holy men proclaim it, but the deaf do not hear it.
When the game of life is over, and he has lost, and he breathes his last, then the fool regrets and repents in his mind. ||2||
He paid the fine, but it is in vain - in the Court of the Lord, his account is not credited.
Those deeds which would have covered him - those deeds, he has not done. ||3||
The Guru has shown me the world to be thus; I sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the One Lord.
Renouncing his pride in strength and cleverness, Nanak has come to the Lord's Sanctuary. ||4||1||152||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Dealing in the Name of the Lord of the Universe,
and pleasing the Saints and holy men, obtain the Beloved Lord and sing His Glorious Praises; play the sound current of the Naad with the five instruments. ||1||Pause||
Obtaining His Mercy, I easily gained the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; now, I am imbued with the Love of the Lord of the Universe.
Serving the Saints, I feel love and affection for my Beloved Lord Master. ||1||
The Guru has implanted spiritual wisdom within my mind, and I rejoice that I shall not have to come back again. I have obtained celestial poise, and the treasure within my mind.
I have renounced all of the affairs of my mind's desires.
It has been so long, so long, so long, so very long, since my mind has felt such a great thirst.
Please, reveal to me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, and show Yourself to me.
Nanak the meek has entered Your Sanctuary; please, take me in Your embrace. ||2||2||153||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Who can destroy the fortress of sin,
and release me from hope, thirst, deception, attachment and doubt? ||1||Pause||
How can I escape the afflictions of sexual desire, anger, greed and pride? ||1||
In the Society of the Saints, love the Naam, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
Night and day, meditate on God.
I have captured and demolished the walls of doubt.
O Nanak, the Naam is my only treasure. ||2||3||154||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Renounce sexual desire, anger and greed;
remember the Name of the Lord of the Universe in your mind.
Meditation on the Lord is the only fruitful action. ||1||Pause||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 063

Renounce pride, attachment, corruption and falsehood, and chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
O mortal, attach yourself to the Feet of the Saints. ||1||
God is the Sustainer of the world, Merciful to the meek, the Purifier of sinners, the Transcendent Lord God. Awaken, and meditate on His Feet.
Perform His devotional worship, O Nanak, and your destiny shall be fulfilled. ||2||4||155||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Pleasure and pain, detachment and ecstasy - the Lord has revealed His Play. ||1||Pause||
One moment, the mortal is in fear, and the next moment he is fearless; in a moment, he gets up and departs.
One moment, he enjoys pleasures, and the next moment, he leaves and goes away. ||1||
One moment, he practices Yoga and intense meditation, and all sorts of worship; the next moment, he wanders in doubt.
One moment, O Nanak, the Lord bestows His Mercy and blesses him with His Love, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||5||156||
Raag Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Seventeenth House, Aasaavaree:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the Universe.
Cherish the Beloved Lord, Har, Har, in your mind.
The Guru says to install it in your consciousness.
Turn away from others, and turn to Him.
Thus you shall obtain your Beloved, O my companion. ||1||Pause||
In the pool of the world is the mud of attachment.
Stuck in it, his feet cannot walk towards the Lord.
The fool is stuck;
he cannot do anything else.
Only by entering the Lord's Sanctuary, O my companion, will you be released. ||1||
Thus your consciousness shall be stable and steady and firm.
Wilderness and household are the same.
Deep within dwells the One Husband Lord;
outwardly, there are many distractions.
Practice Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success.
Says Nanak, this is the way to dwell with the people, and yet remain apart from them. ||2||1||157||
Aasaavaree, Fifth Mehl:
Cherish one desire only:
meditate continually on the Guru.
Install the wisdom of the Saints' Mantra.
Serve the Feet of the Guru,
and you shall meet Him, by Guru's Grace, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
All doubts are dispelled,
and the Lord is seen to be pervading all places.
The fear of death is dispelled,
and the primal place is obtained.
Then, all subservience is removed. ||1||
One who has such destiny recorded upon his forehead, obtains it;
he crosses over the terrifying ocean of fire.
He obtains a place in the home of his own self,
and enjoys the most sublime essence of the Lord's essence.
His hunger is appeased;
Nanak, he is absorbed in celestial peace, O my mind. ||2||2||158||
Aasaavaree, Fifth Mehl:
Sing the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
Meditate on the celestial music.
The tongues of the holy Saints repeat it.
I have heard that this is the way to emancipation.
This is found by the greatest merit, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
The silent sages search for Him.
God is the Master of all.
It is so difficult to find Him in this world, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
He is the Dispeller of distress.
God is the Fulfiller of desires, O my mind. ||1||
O my mind, serve Him.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 064

He is unknowable and inscrutable.
Enshrine love for Him.
He does not perish, or go away, or die.
He is known only through the Guru.
Nanak, my mind is satisfied with the Lord, O my mind. ||2||3||159||
Aasaavaree, Fifth Mehl:
Grab hold of the Support of the One Lord.
Chant the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Submit to the Order of the True Lord.
Receive the treasure in your mind.
Thus you shall be absorbed in peace, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
One who is dead while yet alive,
crosses over the terrifying world-ocean.
One who becomes the dust of all
\- he alone is called fearless.
His anxieties are removed
by the Teachings of the Saints, O my mind. ||1||
That humble being, who takes happiness in the Naam, the Name of the Lord
\- pain never draws near him.
One who listens to the Praise of the Lord, Har, Har,
is obeyed by all men.
How fortunate it is that he came into the world;
Nanak, he is pleasing to God, O my mind. ||2||4||160||
Aasaavaree, Fifth Mehl:
Meeting together, let us sing the Praises of the Lord,
and attain the supreme state.
Those who obtain that sublime essence,
obtain all of the spiritual powers of the Siddhas.
They remain awake and aware night and day;
Nanak, they are blessed by great good fortune, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
Let us wash the feet of the Saints;
our evil-mindedness shall be cleansed.
Becoming the dust of the feet of the Lord's slaves,
one shall not be afflicted with pain.
Taking to the Sanctuary of His devotees,
he is no longer subject to birth and death.
They alone become eternal,
who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind. ||1||
You are my Friend, my Best Friend.
Please, implant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me.
Without Him, there is not any other.
Within my mind, I worship Him in adoration.
I do not forget Him, even for an instant.
How can I live without Him?
I am a sacrifice to the Guru.
Nanak, chant the Name, O my mind. ||2||5||161||
Aasaavaree, Fifth Mehl:
You are the Creator, the Cause of causes.
I cannot think of any other.
Whatever You do, comes to pass.
I sleep in peace and poise.
My mind has become patient,
since I fell at God's Door, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
I gained perfect control over my senses.
Ever since I rid myself of my self-conceit,
my sufferings have ended.
He has showered His Mercy upon me.
The Creator Lord has preserved my honor, O my mind. ||1||
Know that this is the only peace;
accept whatever the Lord does.
No one is bad.
Become the dust of the Feet of the Saints.
He Himself preserves those
who taste the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, O my mind. ||2||
One who has no one to call his own
\- God belongs to him.
God knows the state of our innermost being.
He knows everything.
Please, Lord, save the sinners.
This is Nanak's prayer, O my mind. ||3||6||162||
Aasaavaree, Fifth Mehl, Ik-Tukas:
O my stranger soul,
listen to the call. ||1||Pause||
Whatever you are attached to,

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 065

you shall have to leave it all behind.
These things seem like only a dream,
to one who takes the Lord's Name. ||1||
Forsaking the Lord, and clinging to another,
they run toward death and reincarnation.
But those humble beings, who attach themselves to the Lord, Har, Har,
continue to live.
One who is blessed with the Lord's Mercy,
O Nanak, becomes His devotee. ||2||7||163||232||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Ninth Mehl:
Who should I tell the condition of the mind?
Engrossed in greed, running around in the ten directions, you hold to your hopes of wealth. ||1||Pause||
For the sake of pleasure, you suffer such great pain, and you have to serve each and every person.
You wander from door to door like a dog, unconscious of the Lord's meditation. ||1||
You lose this human life in vain, and You are not even ashamed when others laugh at you.
O Nanak, why not sing the Lord's Praises, so that you may be rid of the body's evil disposition? ||2||1||233||
Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He descends the treacherous precipice, to bathe in the cleansing pool;
without speaking or saying anything, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Like water vapor in the sky, he remains absorbed in the Lord.
He churns the true pleasures to obtain the supreme nectar. ||1||
Listen to such spiritual wisdom, O my mind.
The Lord is totally pervading and permeating all places. ||1||Pause||
One who makes Truthfulness his fast and religious vows, does not suffer the pain of death.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he burns away his anger.
He dwells in the Tenth Gate, immersed in the Samaadhi of deep meditation.
Touching the philosopher's stone, he obtains the supreme status. ||2||
For the benefit of the mind, churn the true essence of reality;
bathing in the over-flowing tank of nectar, filth is washed away.
We become like the One with whom we are imbued.
Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. ||3||
The Guru is cool and soothing like ice; He puts out the fire of the mind.
Smear your body with the ashes of dedicated service,
and live in the home of peace - make this your religious order.
Let the Immaculate Bani of the Word be your playing of the flute. ||4||
Spiritual wisdom within is the supreme, sublime nectar.
Contemplation of the Guru is one's bathing at holy places of pilgrimage.
Worship and adoration within is the Lord's dwelling.
He is the One who blends one's light with the Divine Light. ||5||
He delights in the delightful wisdom of loving the One Lord.
He is one of the self-elect - he merges with the Lord, who occupies the throne.
He performs his works in obedience to the Will of his Lord and Master.
The Unknowable Lord cannot be understood. ||6||
The lotus originates in the water, and yet it remains distinct from the water.
Just so, the Divine Light pervades and permeates the water of the world.
Who is near, and who is far away?
I sing the Glories of the Lord, the treasure of virtue; I behold Him ever-present. ||7||
Inwardly and outwardly, there is none other than Him.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 066

Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass.
Listen, O Bharthari Yogi - Nanak speaks after deliberation;
the Immaculate Name is my only Support. ||8||1||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
All meditation, all austerities, and all clever tricks,
lead one to wander in the wilderness, but he does not find the Path.
Without understanding, he is not approved;
without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, ashes are thrown upon one's head. ||1||
True is the Master; the world comes and goes.
The mortal is emancipated, as Gurmukh, as the Lord's slave. ||1||Pause||
The world is bound by its attachments to the many desires.
Through the Guru's Teachings, some become free of desire.
Within them is the Naam, and their heart lotus blossoms forth.
They have no fear of death. ||2||
The men of the world are conquered by woman; they love the ladies.
Attached to children and wife, they forget the Naam.
They waste this human life in vain, and lose the game in the gamble.
Serving the True Guru is the best occupation. ||3||
One who speaks egotistically in public,
never attains liberation within.
One who burns away his attachment to Maya, by the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
meditates forever within his heart on the Immaculate Naam. ||4||
He restrains his wandering mind, and keeps it under control.
The company of such a Sikh is obtained only by Grace.
Without the Guru, he goes astray and continues coming and going.
Bestowing His Mercy, the Lord unites him in Union. ||5||
I cannot describe the Beauteous Lord.
I speak the unspoken; I cannot estimate His value.
All pain and pleasure come by Your Will.
All pain is eradicated by the True Name. ||6||
He plays the instrument without hands, and dances without feet.
But if he understands the Word of the Shabad, then he shall behold the True Lord.
With the True Lord within the self, all happiness comes.
Showering His Mercy, the Preserving Lord preserves him. ||7||
He understands the three worlds; he eliminates his self-conceit.
He understands the Bani of the Word, and he is absorbed into the True Lord.
Contemplating the Shabad, he enshrines love for the One Lord.
O Nanak, blessed is the Lord, the Embellisher. ||8||2||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
There are innumerable writings; those who write them take pride in them.
When one's mind accepts the Truth, he understands, and speaks of it.
Words, spoken and read again and again, are useless loads.
There are innumerable writings, but the Infinite Lord remains unwritten. ||1||
Know that such a True Lord is the One and only.
Understand that birth and death come according to the Lord's Will. ||1||Pause||
Because of attachment to Maya, the world is bound by the Messenger of Death.
These bonds are released when one remembers the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Guru is the Giver of peace; do not look for any other.
In this world, and the next, He shall stand by you. ||2||
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, embraces love for the One Lord.
One who eats the uneatable, has his doubts dispelled.
He is Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive; the Naam abides in his mind.
Becoming Gurmukh, he merges into the True Lord. ||3||
The One who created the earth and the Akaashic ethers of the sky,
established all; He establishes and disestablishes.
He Himself is permeating all.
He does not consult anyone; He Himself forgives. ||4||
You are the Ocean, over-flowing with jewels and rubies.
You are immaculate and pure, the true treasure of virtue.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 067

Peace is enjoyed, meeting the Guru, the Spiritual Teacher.
The Lord is the only Master; He is the only Minister. ||5||
The world is held in bondage; he alone is emancipated, who conquers his ego.
How rare in the world is that wise person, who practices this.
How rare in this world is that scholar who reflects upon this.
Without meeting the True Guru, all wander in ego. ||6||
The world is unhappy; only a few are happy.
The world is diseased, from its indulgences; it weeps over its lost virtue.
The world wells up, and then subsides, losing its honor.
He alone, who becomes Gurmukh, understands. ||7||
His price is so costly; His weight is unbearable.
He is immovable and undeceivable; enshrine Him in your mind, through the Guru's Teachings.
Meet Him through love, become pleasing to Him, and act in fear of Him.
Nanak the lowly says this, after deep contemplation. ||8||3||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
When someone dies, the five passions meet and mourn his death.
Overcoming self-conceit, he washes off his filth with the Word of the Shabad.
One who knows and understands, enters the home of peace and poise.
Without understanding, he loses all his honor. ||1||
Who dies, and who weeps for him?
O Lord, Creator, Cause of causes, You are over the heads of all. ||1||Pause||
Who weeps over the pain of the dead?
Those who weep, do so over their own troubles.
God knows the condition of those who are so affected.
Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. ||2||
One who remains dead while yet alive, is saved, and saves others as well.
Celebrate the Victory of the Lord; taking to His Sanctuary, the supreme status is obtained.
I am a sacrifice to the feet of the True Guru.
The Guru is the boat; through the Shabad of His Word, the terrifying world-ocean is crossed over. ||3||
He Himself is Fearless; His Divine Light is contained in all.
Without the Name, the world is defiled and untouchable.
Through evil-mindedness, they are ruined; why should they cry out and weep?
They are born only to die, without hearing the music of devotional worship. ||4||
Only one's true friends mourn one's death.
Those under the sway of the three dispositions continue to mourn on and on.
Disregarding pain and pleasure, center your consciousness on the Lord.
Dedicate your body and mind to the Love of the Lord. ||5||
The One Lord dwells within the various and countless beings.
There are so many rituals and religious faiths, their number is innumerable.
Without the Fear of God, and devotional worship, one's life is in vain.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the supreme wealth is obtained. ||6||
He Himself dies, and He Himself kills.
He Himself establishes, and having established, disestablishes.
He created the Universe, and by His Divine Nature, instilled His Divine Light into it.
One who reflects upon the Word of the Shabad, meets the Lord, without doubt. ||7||
Pollution is the burning fire, which is consuming the world.
Pollution is in the water, upon the land, and everywhere.
O Nanak, people are born and die in pollution.
By Guru's Grace, they drink in the Lord's sublime elixir. ||8||4||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
One who contemplates his own self, tests the worth of the jewel.
With a single glance, the Perfect Guru saves him.
When the Guru is pleased, one's mind comforts itself. ||1||
He is such a banker, who tests us.
By His True Glance of Grace, we are blessed with the Love of the One Lord, and are saved. ||1||Pause||
The capital of the Naam is immaculate and sublime.
That peddler is rendered pure, who is imbued with the Truth.
Praising the Lord, in the house of poise, he attains the Guru, the Creator. ||2||
One who burns away hope and desire through the Word of the Shabad,
chants the Lord's Name, and inspires others to chant it as well.
Through the Guru, he finds the Path home, to the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 068

His body becomes golden, by the Lord's Incomparable Light.
He beholds the divine beauty in all the three worlds.
That inexhaustible wealth of Truth is now in my lap. ||4||
In the five elements, the three worlds, the nine regions and the four directions, the Lord is pervading.
He supports the earth and the sky, exercising His almighty power.
He turns the outgoing mind around. ||5||
The fool does not realize what he sees with his eyes.
He does not taste with his tongue, and does not understand what is said.
Intoxicated with poison, he argues with the world. ||6||
In the uplifting society, one is uplifted.
He chases after virtue and washes off his sins.
Without serving the Guru, celestial poise is not obtained. ||7||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a diamond, a jewel, a ruby.
The pearl of the mind is the inner wealth.
O Nanak, the Lord tests us, and blesses us with His Glance of Grace. ||8||5||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom, meditation and satisfaction of the mind.

He enjoys the ambrosial wisdom, and the highest sublime essence.
He overcomes the five evil passions, and becomes the happiest of all men. ||3||
Your Divine Light is contained in all; everyone belongs to You.
You Yourself join and separate again.
Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. ||4||
He demolishes, and He builds; by His Order, he merges us into Himself.
Whatever is pleasing to His Will, happens.
Without the Guru, no one obtains the Perfect Lord. ||5||
In childhood and old age, he does not understand.
In the prime of youth, he is drowned in his pride.
Without the Name, what can the fool obtain? ||6||
He does not know the One who blesses him with nourishment and wealth.
Deluded by doubt, he later regrets and repents.
The noose of death is around the neck of that crazy madman. ||7||
I saw the world drowning, and I ran away in fear.
How very fortunate are those who have been saved by the True Guru.
O Nanak, they are attached to the feet of the Guru. ||8||6||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
They sing religious songs, but their consciousness is wicked.
They sing the songs, and call themselves divine,
but without the Name, their minds are false and wicked. ||1||
Where are you going? O mind, remain in your own home.
The Gurmukhs are satisfied with the Lord's Name; searching, they easily find the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment fill the mind and body;
greed and egotism lead only to pain.
How can the mind be comforted without the Lord's Name? ||2||
One who cleanses himself within, knows the True Lord.
The Gurmukh knows the condition of his innermost being.
Without the True Word of the Shabad, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is not realized. ||3||
One who merges his form into the Formless Lord,
abides in the True Lord, the Powerful, beyond power.
Such a person does not enter into the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||
Go there, where you may obtain the Naam, the Name of the Lord.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 069

Night and day, I am imbued with the Word of the Guru's Bani, and the Naam. ||6||
When my God attaches someone to Him, only then is that person attached.
Conquering ego, he remains awake to the Word of the Shabad.
Here and hereafter, he enjoys lasting peace. ||7||
The fickle mind does not know the way.
The filthy self-willed manmukh does not understand the Shabad.
The Gurmukh chants the Immaculate Naam. ||8||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 070

Aasaa, First Mehl:
When the body perishes, whose wealth is it?
Without the Guru, how can the Lord's Name be obtained?
The wealth of the Lord's Name is my Companion and Helper.
Night and day, center your loving attention on the Immaculate Lord. ||1||
Without the Lord's Name, who is ours?
I look upon pleasure and pain alike; I shall not forsake the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Lord Himself forgives me, and blends me with Himself. ||1||Pause||
The fool loves gold and women.
Attached to duality, he has forgotten the Naam.
O Lord, he alone chants the Naam, whom You have forgiven.
Death cannot touch one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
The Lord, the Guru, is the Giver; the Lord, the Sustainer of the World.
If it is pleasing to Your Will, please preserve me, O Merciful Lord.
As Gurmukh, my mind is pleased with the Lord.
My diseases are cured, and my pains are taken away. ||3||
There is no other medicine, Tantric charm or mantra.
Meditative remembrance upon the Lord, Har, Har, destroys sins.
You Yourself cause us to stray from the path, and forget the Naam.
Showering Your Mercy, You Yourself save us. ||4||
The mind is diseased with doubt, superstition and duality.
Without the Guru, it dwells in doubt, and contemplates duality.
The Guru reveals the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the Primal Lord.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 071

Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Those heads adorned with braided hair, with their parts painted with vermillion
\- those heads were shaved with scissors, and their throats were choked with dust.
They lived in palatial mansions, but now, they cannot even sit near the palaces. ||1||
Hail to You, O Father Lord, Hail to You!
O Primal Lord. Your limits are not known; You create, and create, and behold the scenes. ||1||Pause||
When they were married, their husbands looked so handsome beside them.
They came in palanquins, decorated with ivory;
water was sprinkled over their heads, and glittering fans were waved above them. ||2||
They were given hundreds of thousands of coins when they sat, and hundreds of thousands of coins when they stood.
They ate coconuts and dates, and rested comfortably upon their beds.
But ropes were put around their necks, and their strings of pearls were broken. ||3||
Their wealth and youthful beauty, which gave them so much pleasure, have now become their enemies.
The order was given to the soldiers, who dishonored them, and carried them away.
If it is pleasing to God's Will, He bestows greatness; if is pleases His Will, He bestows punishment. ||4||
If someone focuses on the Lord beforehand, then why should he be punished?
The kings had lost their higher consciousness, reveling in pleasure and sensuality.
Since Baabar's rule has been proclaimed, even the princes have no food to eat. ||5||
The Muslims have lost their five times of daily prayer, and the Hindus have lost their worship as well.
Without their sacred squares, how shall the Hindu women bathe and apply the frontal marks to their foreheads?
They never remembered their Lord as Raam, and now they cannot even chant Khudaa-i||6||
Some have returned to their homes, and meeting their relatives, they ask about their safety.
For some, it is pre-ordained that they shall sit and cry out in pain.
Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass. O Nanak, what is the fate of mankind? ||7||11||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Where are the games, the stables, the horses? Where are the drums and the bugles?
Where are the sword-belts and chariots? Where are those scarlet uniforms?
Where are the rings and the beautiful faces? They are no longer to be seen here. ||1||
This world is Yours; You are the Lord of the Universe.
In an instant, You establish and disestablish. You distribute wealth as it pleases You. ||1||Pause||
Where are the houses, the gates, the hotels and palaces? Where are those beautiful way-stations?
Where are those beautiful women, reclining on their beds, whose beauty would not allow one to sleep?
Where are those betel leaves, their sellers, and the haremees? They have vanished like shadows. ||2||
For the sake of this wealth, so many were ruined; because of this wealth, so many have been disgraced.
It was not gathered without sin, and it does not go along with the dead.
Those, whom the Creator Lord would destroy - first He strips them of virtue. ||3||
Millions of religious leaders failed to halt the invader, when they heard of the Emperor's invasion.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 072

He burned the rest-houses and the ancient temples; he cut the princes limb from limb, and cast them into the dust.
None of the Mugals went blind, and no one performed any miracle. ||4||
The battle raged between the Mugals and the Pat'haans, and the swords clashed on the battlefield.
They took aim and fired their guns, and they attacked with their elephants.
Those men whose letters were torn in the Lord's Court, were destined to die, O Siblings of Destiny. ||5||
The Hindu women, the Muslim women, the Bhattis and the Rajputs
\- some had their robes torn away, from head to foot, while others came to dwell in the cremation ground.
Their husbands did not return home - how did they pass their night? ||6||
The Creator Himself acts, and causes others to act. Unto whom should we complain?
Pleasure and pain come by Your Will; unto whom should we go and cry?
The Commander issues His Command, and is pleased. O Nanak, we receive what is written in our destiny. ||7||12||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, Kaafee, First Mehl, Eighth House, Ashtapadees:
As the shepherd is in the field for only a short time, so is one in the world.
Practicing falsehood, they build their homes. ||1||
Wake up! Wake up! O sleepers, see that the travelling merchant is leaving. ||1||Pause||
Go ahead and build your houses, if you think you will stay here forever and ever.
The body shall fall, and the soul shall depart; if only they knew this. ||2||
Why do you cry out and mourn for the dead? The Lord is, and shall always be.
You mourn for that person, but who will mourn for you? ||3||
You are engrossed in worldly entanglements, O Siblings of Destiny, and you are practicing falsehood.
The dead person does not hear anything at all; your cries are heard only by other people. ||4||
Only the Lord, who causes the mortal to sleep, O Nanak, can awaken him again.
One who understands his true home, does not sleep. ||5||
If the departing mortal can take his wealth with him,
then go ahead and gather wealth yourself. See this, reflect upon it, and understand. ||6||
Make your deals, and obtain the true merchandise, or else you shall regret it later.
Abandon your vices, and practice virtue, and you shall obtain the essence of reality. ||7||
Plant the seed of Truth in the soil of Dharmic faith, and practice such farming.
Only then will you be known as a merchant, if you take your profits with you. ||8||
If the Lord shows His Mercy, one meets the True Guru; contemplating Him, one comes to understand.
Then, one chants the Naam, hears the Naam, and deals only in the Naam. ||9||
As is the profit, so is the loss; this is the way of the world.
Whatever pleases His Will, O Nanak, is glory for me. ||10||13||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
I have searched in the four directions, but no one is mine.
If it pleases You, O Lord Master, then You are mine, and I am Yours. ||1||
There is no other door for me; where shall I go to worship?
You are my only Lord; Your True Name is in my mouth. ||1||Pause||
Some serve the Siddhas, the beings of spiritual perfection, and some serve spiritual teachers; they beg for wealth and miraculous powers.
May I never forget the Naam, the Name of the One Lord. This is the wisdom of the True Guru. ||2||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 073

Why do the Yogis, the revellers, and the beggars wander in foreign lands?
They do not understand the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and the essence of excellence within them. ||3||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, the teachers and astrologers, and those who endlessly read the Puraanas,
do not know what is within; God is hidden deep within them. ||4||
Some penitents perform penance in the forests, and some dwell forever at sacred shrines.
The unenlightened people do not understand themselves - why have they become renunciates? ||5||
Some control their sexual energy, and are known as celibates.
But without the Guru's Word, they are not saved, and they wander in reincarnation. ||6||
Some are householders, servants, and seekers, attached to the Guru's Teachings.
They hold fast to the Naam, to charity, to cleansing and purification; they remain awake in devotion to the Lord. ||7||
Through the Guru, the Gate of the Lord's Home is found, and that place is recognized.
Nanak does not forget the Naam; his mind has surrendered to the True Lord. ||8||14||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Stilling the desires of the mind, the mortal truly crosses over the terrifying world-ocean.
In the very beginning, and throughout the ages, You have been the Merciful Lord and Master; I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||
You are the Giver, and I am a mere beggar. Lord, please grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
The Gurmukh meditates on the Naam; the temple of his mind resounds with joy. ||1||Pause||
Renouncing false greed, one comes to realize the Truth.
So let yourself be absorbed in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and know this supreme realization. ||2||
This mind is a greedy king, engrossed in greed.
The Gurmukh eliminates his greed, and comes to an understanding with the Lord. ||3||
Planting the seeds in the rocky soil, how can one reap a profit?
The self-willed manmukh is not pleased with Truth; the false are buried in falsehood. ||4||
So renounce greed - you are blind! Greed only brings pain.
When the True Lord dwells within the mind, the poisonous ego is conquered. ||5||
Renounce the evil way of duality, or you shall be plundered, O Siblings of Destiny.
Day and night, praise the Naam, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru's protection. ||6||
The self-willed manmukh is a rock, a stone. His life is cursed and useless.
No matter now long a stone is kept under water, it still remains dry at its core. ||7||
The Name of the Lord is the treasure; the Perfect Guru has given it to me.
O Nanak, one who does not forget the Naam, churns and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||8||15||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The travellers travel from one road to another.
The world is engrossed in its entanglements, and does not appreciate the Truth. ||1||
Why wander around, and why go searching, when the Guru's Shabad reveals Him to us?
Leaving behind egotism and attachment, I have arrived at my own home. ||1||Pause||
Through Truth, one meets the True One; He is not obtained through falsehood.
Centering your consciousness on the True Lord, you shall not have to come into the world again. ||2||
Why do you weep for the dead? You do not know how to weep.
Weep by praising the True Lord, and recognize His Command. ||3||
Blessed is the birth of one who is destined to abide by the Lord's Command.
He obtains the true profit, realizing the Lord's Command. ||4||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 074

If it pleases the Commander, one goes to His Court, robed in honor.
By His Command, God's slaves are hit over the head. ||5||
The profit is earned by enshrining Truth and justice in the mind.
They obtain what is written in their destiny, and overcome pride. ||6||
The self-willed manmukhs are hit over the head, and consumed by conflict.
The cheaters are plundered by falsehood; they are chained and led away. ||7||
Enshrine the Lord Master in your mind, and you shall not have to repent.
He forgives our sins, when we practice the Teachings of the Guru's Word. ||8||
Nanak begs for the True Name, which is obtained by the Gurmukh.
Without You, I have no other at all; please, bless me with Your Glance of Grace. ||9||16||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Why should I go searching in the forests, when the woods of my home are so green?
The True Word of the Shabad has instantaneously come and settled in my heart. ||1||
Wherever I look, there He is; I know no other.
Working for the Guru, one realizes the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||1||Pause||
The True Lord blends us with Himself, when it is pleasing to His Mind.
One who ever walks in accordance with His Will, merges into His Being. ||2||
When the True Lord dwells in the mind, that mind flourishes.
He Himself grants greatness; His Gifts are never exhausted. ||3||
Serving this and that person, how can one obtain the Lord's Court?
If someone embarks on a boat of stone, he shall drown with its cargo. ||4||
So offer your mind, and surrender your head with it.
The Gurmukh realizes the true essence, and finds the home of his own self. ||5||
People discuss birth and death; the Creator created this.
Those who conquer their selfhood and remain dead, shall never have to die again. ||6||
Do those deeds which the Primal Lord has ordered for you.
If one surrenders his mind upon meeting the True Guru, who can estimate its value? ||7||
That Lord Master is the Assayer of the jewel of the mind; He places the value on it.
O Nanak, True is the Glory of that one, in whose mind the Lord Master dwells. ||8||17||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are deluded by doubt and duality.
Those who abandon the roots and cling to the branches, shall obtain only ashes. ||1||
Without the Name, how can one be emancipated? Who knows this?
One who becomes Gurmukh is emancipated; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. ||1||Pause||
Those who serve the One Lord become perfect in their understanding, O Siblings of Destiny.
The Lord's humble servant finds Sanctuary in Him, the Immaculate One, from the very beginning, and throughout the ages. ||2||
My Lord and Master is the One; there is no other, O Siblings of Destiny.
By the Grace of the True Lord, celestial peace is obtained. ||3||
Without the Guru, no one has obtained Him, although many may claim to have done so.
He Himself reveals the Way, and implants true devotion within. ||4||
Even if the self-willed manmukh is instructed, he stills goes into the wilderness.
Without the Lord's Name, he shall not be emancipated; he shall die, and sink into hell. ||5||
He wanders through birth and death, and never chants the Lord's Name.
He never realizes his own value, without serving the Guru. ||6||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 075

Whatever service the Lord causes us to do, that is just what we do.
He Himself acts; who else should be mentioned? He beholds His own greatness. ||7||
He alone serves the Guru, whom the Lord Himself inspires to do so.
O Nanak, offering his head, one is emancipated, and honored in the Court of the Lord. ||8||18||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Beautiful is the Supreme Lord and Master, and beautiful is the Word of the Guru's Bani.
By great good fortune, one meets the True Guru, and the supreme status of Nirvaanaa is obtained. ||1||
I am the lowest slave of Your slaves; I am Your most humble servant.
As You keep me, I live. Your Name is in my mouth. ||1||Pause||
I have such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; my mind accepts Your Will, and so You are pleased with me.
Greatness is in the Hands of my Lord and Master; by His Will, honor is obtained. ||2||
Do not think that the True Lord is far away; He is deep within.
Wherever I look, there I find Him pervading; how can I estimate His value? ||3||
He Himself does, and He Himself undoes. He Himself beholds His glorious greatness.
Becoming Gurmukh, one beholds Him, and so, His value is appraised. ||4||
So earn your profits while you are alive, by serving the Guru.
If it is so pre-ordained, then one finds the True Guru. ||5||
The self-willed manmukhs continually lose, and wander around, deluded by doubt.
The blind manmukhs do not remember the Lord; how can they obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan? ||6||
One's coming into the world is judged worthwhile only if one lovingly attunes oneself to the True Lord.
Meeting the Guru, one becomes invaluable; his light merges into the Light. ||7||
Day and night, he remains detached, and serves the Primal Lord.
O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Lord's Lotus Feet, are content with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||8||19||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
No matter how much one may describe the Lord, His limits still cannot be known.
I am without any support; You, O Lord, are my only Support; You are my almighty power. ||1||
This is Nanak's prayer, that he may be adorned with the True Name.
When self-conceit is eradicated, and understanding is obtained, one meets the Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||
Abandoning egotism and pride, one obtains contemplative understanding.
When the mind surrenders to the Lord Master, He bestows the support of the Truth. ||2||
Day and night, remain content with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; that is the true service.
No misfortune troubles one who follows the Command of the Lord's Will. ||3||
One who follows the Command of the Lord's Will is taken into the Lord's Treasury.
The counterfeit find no place there; they are mixed with the false ones. ||4||
Forever and ever, the genuine coins are treasured; with them, the true merchandise is purchased.
The false ones are not seen in the Lord's Treasury; they are seized and cast into the fire again. ||5||
Those who understand their own souls, are themselves the Supreme Soul.
The One Lord is the tree of ambrosial nectar, which bears the ambrosial fruit. ||6||
Those who taste the ambrosial fruit remain satisfied with Truth.
They have no doubt or sense of separation - their tongues taste the divine taste. ||7||
By His Command, and through your past actions, you came into the world; walk forever according to His Will.
Please, grant virtue to Nanak, the virtueless one; bless him with the glorious greatness of the Truth. ||8||20||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
One whose mind is attuned to the Lord's Name speaks the truth.
What would the people lose, if I became pleasing to You, O Lord? ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 076

As long as there is the breath of life, meditate on the True Lord.
You shall receive the profit of singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and find peace. ||1||Pause||
True is Your Service; bless me with it, O Merciful Lord.
I live by praising You; You are my Anchor and Support. ||2||
I am Your servant, the gate-keeper at Your Gate; You alone know my pain.
How wonderful is Your devotional worship! It removes all pains. ||3||
The Gurmukhs know that by chanting the Naam, they shall dwell in His Court, in His Presence.
True and acceptable is that time, when one recognizes the Word of the Shabad. ||4||
Those who practice Truth, contentment and love, obtain the supplies of the Lord's Name.
So banish corruption from your mind, and the True One will grant you Truth. ||5||
The True Lord inspires true love in the truthful.
He Himself administers justice, as it pleases His Will. ||6||
True is the gift of the True, Compassionate Lord.
Day and night, I serve the One whose Name is priceless. ||7||
You are so sublime, and I am so lowly, but I am called Your slave.
Please, shower Nanak with Your Glance of Grace, that he, the separated one, may merge with You again, O Lord. ||8||21||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
How can coming and going, the cycle of reincarnation be ended? And how can one meet the Lord?
The pain of birth and death is so great, in constant skepticism and duality. ||1||
Without the Name, what is life? Cleverness is detestable and cursed.
One who does not serve the Holy True Guru, is not pleased by devotion to the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Coming and going is ended only when one finds the True Guru.
He gives the wealth and capital of the Lord's Name, and false doubt is destroyed. ||2||
Joining the humble Saintly beings, let us sing the blessed, blessed Praises of the Lord.
The Primal Lord, the Infinite, is obtained by the Gurmukh. ||3||
The drama of the world is staged like the show of a buffoon.
For an instant, for a moment, the show is seen, but it disappears in no time at all. ||4||
The game of chance is played on the board of egotism, with the pieces of falsehood and ego.
The whole world loses; he alone wins, who reflects upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||5||
As is the cane in the hand of the blind man, so is the Lord's Name for me.
The Lord's Name is my Support, night and day and morning. ||6||
As You keep me, Lord, I live; the Lord's Name is my only Support.
It is my only comfort in the end; the gate of salvation is found by His humble servants. ||7||
The pain of birth and death is removed, by chanting and meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, one who does not forget the Naam, is saved by the Perfect Guru. ||8||22||
Aasaa, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Shaastras, the Vedas and the Simritees are contained in the ocean of Your Name; the River Ganges is held in Your Feet.
The intellect can understand the world of the three modes, but You, O Primal Lord, are totally astounding. ||1||
Servant Nanak meditates on His Feet, and chants the Ambrosial Word of His Bani. ||1||Pause||
Three hundred thirty million gods are Your servants. You bestow wealth, and the supernatural powers of the Siddhas; You are the Support of the breath of life.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 077

His beauteous forms cannot be comprehended; what can anyone accomplish by discussing and debating? ||2||
Throughout the ages, You are the three qualities, and the four sources of creation.
If You show Your Mercy, then one obtains the supreme status, and speaks the Unspoken Speech. ||3||
You are the Creator; all are created by You. What can any mortal being do?
He alone, upon whom You shower Your Grace, is absorbed into the Truth. ||4||
Everyone who comes and goes chants Your Name.
When it is pleasing to Your Will, then the Gurmukh understands. Otherwise, the self-willed manmukhs wander in ignorance. ||5||
You gave the four Vedas to Brahma, for him to read and read continually, and reflect upon.
The wretched one does not understand His Command, and is reincarnated into heaven and hell. ||6||
In each and every age, He creates the kings, who are sung of as His Incarnations.
Even they have not found His limits; what can I speak of and contemplate? ||7||
You are True, and all that You do is True. If You bless me with the Truth, I will speak on it.
One whom You inspire to understand the Truth, is easily absorbed into the Naam. ||8||1||23||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The True Guru has dispelled my doubts.
He has enshrined the Immaculate Name of the Lord within my mind.
Focusing on the Word of the Shabad, I have obtained lasting peace. ||1||
Listen, O my mind, to the essence of spiritual wisdom.
The Great Giver knows our condition completely; the Gurmukh obtains the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The great glory of meeting the True Guru is
that it has quenched the fire of possessiveness and desire;
imbued with peace and poise, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Without the Perfect Guru, no one knows the Lord.
Attached to Maya, they are engrossed in duality.
The Gurmukh receives the Naam, and the Bani of the Lord's Word. ||3||
Service to the Guru is the most excellent and sublime penance of penances.
The Dear Lord dwells in the mind, and all suffering departs.
Then, at the Gate of the True Lord, one appears truthful. ||4||
Serving the Guru, one comes to know the three worlds.
Understanding his own self, he obtains the Lord.
Through the True Word of His Bani, we enter the Mansion of His Presence. ||5||
Serving the Guru, all of one's generations are saved.
Keep the Immaculate Naam enshrined within your heart.
In the Court of the True Lord, you shall be adorned with True Glory. ||6||
How very fortunate are they, who are committed to the Guru's service.
Night and day, they are engaged in devotional worship; the True Name is implanted within them.
Through the Naam, all of one's generations are saved. ||7||
Nanak chants the true thought.
Keep the Name of the Lord enshrined within your heart.
Imbued with devotion to the Lord, the gate of salvation is found. ||8||2||24||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Everyone lives, hoping in hope.
Understanding His Command, one becomes free of desire.
So many are asleep in hope.
He alone wakes up, whom the Lord awakens. ||1||
The True Guru has led me to understand the Naam, the Name of the Lord; without the Naam, hunger does not go away.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 078

Through the Naam, the fire of desire is extinguished; the Naam is obtained by His Will. ||1||Pause||
In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, realize the Word of the Shabad.
By this devotional worship, egotism is eliminated.
Serving the True Guru, one becomes approved.
So know the One, who created hope and desire. ||2||
What shall we offer to one who proclaims the Word of the Shabad?
By His Grace, the Naam is enshrined within our minds.
Offer your head, and shed your self-conceit.
One who understands the Lord's Command finds lasting peace. ||3||
He Himself does, and causes others to do.
He Himself enshrines His Name in the mind of the Gurmukh.
He Himself misleads us, and He Himself puts us back on the Path.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, we merge into the True Lord. ||4||
True is the Shabad, and True is the Word of the Lord's Bani.
In each and every age, the Gurmukhs speak it and chant it.
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt and attachment.
Without the Name, everyone wanders around insane. ||5||
Throughout the three worlds, is the one Maya.
The fool reads and reads, but holds tight to duality.
He performs all sorts of rituals, but still suffers terrible pain.
Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained. ||6||
Reflective meditation upon the Shabad is such sweet nectar.
Night and day, one enjoys it, subduing his ego.
When the Lord showers His Mercy, we enjoy celestial bliss.
Imbued with the Naam, love the True Lord forever. ||7||
Meditate on the Lord, and read and reflect upon the Guru's Shabad.
Subdue your ego and meditate on the Lord.
Meditate on the Lord, and be imbued with fear and love of the True One.
O Nanak, enshrine the Naam within your heart, through the Guru's Teachings. ||8||3||25||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, Eighth House, Kaafee:
Peace emanates from the Guru; He puts out the fire of desire.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained from the Guru; it is the greatest greatness. ||1||
Keep the One Name in your consciousness, O my Siblings of Destiny.
Seeing the world on fire, I have hurried to the Lord's Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||
Spiritual wisdom emanates from the Guru; reflect upon the supreme essence of reality.
Through the Guru, the Lord's Mansion and His Court are attained; His devotional worship is overflowing with treasures. ||2||
The Gurmukh meditates on the Naam; he achieves reflective meditation and understanding.
The Gurmukh is the Lord's devotee, immersed in His Praises; the Infinite Word of the Shabad dwells within him. ||3||
Happiness emanates from the Gurmukh; he never suffers pain.
The Gurmukh conquers his ego, and his mind is immaculately pure. ||4||
Meeting the True Guru, self-conceit is removed, and understanding of the three worlds is obtained.
The Immaculate Divine Light is pervading and permeating everywhere; one's light merges into the Light. ||5||
The Perfect Guru instructs, and one's intellect becomes sublime.
A cooling and soothing peace comes within, and through the Naam, peace is obtained. ||6||
One meets the Perfect True Guru only when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace.
All sins and vices are eradicated, and one shall never again suffer pain or distress. ||7||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 079

Glory is in His Hands; He bestows His Name, and attaches us to it.
O Nanak, the treasure of the Naam abides within the mind, and glory is obtained. ||8||4||26||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Listen, O mortal: enshrine His Name within your mind; He shall come to meet with you, O my Sibling of Destiny.
Night and day, center your consciousness on true devotional worship of the True Lord. ||1||
Meditate on the One Naam, and you shall find peace, O my Siblings of Destiny.
Eradicate egotism and duality, and your glory shall be glorious. ||1||Pause||
The angels, humans and silent sages long for this devotional worship, but without the True Guru, it cannot be attained.
The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers read their books, but they do not understand. ||2||
He Himself keeps all in His Hand; nothing else can be said.
Whatever He gives, is received. The Guru has imparted this understanding to me. ||3||
All beings and creatures are His; He belongs to all.
So who can we call bad, since there is no other? ||4||
The Command of the One Lord is pervading throughout; duty to the One Lord is upon the heads of all.
He Himself has led them astray, and placed greed and corruption within their hearts. ||5||
He has sanctified those few Gurmukhs who understand Him, and reflect upon Him.
He grants devotional worship to them, and within them is the treasure. ||6||
The spiritual teachers know nothing but the Truth; they obtain true understanding.
They are led astray by Him, but they do not go astray, because they know the True Lord. ||7||
Within the homes of their bodies, the five passions are pervading, but here, the five are well-behaved.
O Nanak, without the True Guru, they are not overcome; through the Naam, the ego is conquered. ||8||5||27||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Everything is within the home of your own self; there is nothing beyond it.
By Guru's Grace, it is obtained, and the doors of the inner heart are opened wide. ||1||
From the True Guru, the Lord's Name is obtained, O Siblings of Destiny.
The treasure of the Naam is within; the Perfect True Guru has shown this to me. ||1||Pause||
One who is a buyer of the Lord's Name, finds it, and obtains the jewel of contemplation.
He opens the doors deep within, and through the Eyes of Divine Vision, beholds the treasure of liberation. ||2||
There are so many mansions within the body; the soul dwells within them.
He obtains the fruits of his mind's desires, and he shall not have to go through reincarnation again. ||3||
The appraisers cherish the commodity of the Name; they obtain understanding from the Guru.
The wealth of the Naam is priceless; how few are the Gurmukhs who obtain it. ||4||
Searching outwardly, what can anyone find? The commodity is deep within the home of the self, O Siblings of Destiny.
The entire world is wandering around, deluded by doubt; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. ||5||
The false one leaves his own hearth and home, and goes out to another's home.
Like a thief, he is caught, and without the Naam, he is beaten and struck down. ||6||
Those who know their own home, are happy, O Siblings of Destiny.
They realize God within their own hearts, through the glorious greatness of the Guru. ||7||
He Himself gives gifts, and He Himself bestows understanding; unto whom can we complain?
O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall obtain glory in the True Court. ||8||6||28||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 080

Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Those who recognize their own selves, enjoy the sweet flavor, O Siblings of Destiny.
Those who drink in the sublime essence of the Lord are emancipated; they love the Truth. ||1||
The Beloved Lord is the purest of the pure; He comes to dwell in the pure mind.
Praising the Lord, through the Guru's Teachings, one remains unaffected by corruption. ||1||Pause||
Without the Word of the Shabad, they do not understand themselves -they are totally blind, O Siblings of Destiny.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the heart is illuminated, and in the end, only the Naam shall be your companion. ||2||
They are occupied with the Naam, and only the Naam; they deal only in the Naam.
Deep within their hearts is the Naam; upon their lips is the Naam; they contemplate the Word of God, and the Naam. ||3||
They listen to the Naam, believe in the Naam, and through the Naam, they obtain glory.
They praise the Naam, forever and ever, and through the Naam, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||
Through the Naam, their hearts are illumined, and through the Naam, they obtain honor.
Through the Naam, peace wells up; I seek the Sanctuary of the Naam. ||5||
Without the Naam, no one is accepted; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor.
In the City of Death, they are tied down and beaten, and they lose their lives in vain. ||6||
Those Gurmukhs who realize the Naam, all serve the Naam.
So believe in the Naam, and only the Naam; through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained. ||7||
He alone receives it, unto whom it is given. Through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam is realized.
O Nanak, everything is under the influence of the Naam; by perfect good destiny, a few obtain it. ||8||7||29||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The deserted brides do not obtain the Mansion of their Husband's Presence, nor do they know His taste.
They speak harsh words, and do not bow to Him; they are in love with another. ||1||
How can this mind come under control?
By Guru's Grace, it is held in check; instructed in spiritual wisdom, it returns to its home. ||1||Pause||
He Himself adorns the happy soul-brides; they bear Him love and affection.
They live in harmony with the Sweet Will of the True Guru, naturally adorned with the Naam. ||2||
They enjoy their Beloved forever, and their bed is decorated with Truth.
They are fascinated with the Love of their Husband Lord; meeting their Beloved, they obtain peace. ||3||
Spiritual wisdom is the incomparable decoration of the happy soul-bride.
She is so beautiful - she is the queen of all; she enjoys the love and affection of her Husband Lord. ||4||
The True Lord, the Unseen, the Infinite, has infused His Love among the happy soul-brides.
They serve their True Guru, with true love and affection. ||5||
The happy soul-bride has adorned herself with the necklace of virtue.
She applies the perfume of love to her body, and within her mind is the jewel of reflective meditation. ||6||
Those who are imbued with devotional worship are the most exalted. Their social standing and honor come from the Word of the Shabad.
Without the Naam, all are low class, like maggots in manure. ||7||
Everyone proclaims, “Me, me!”; but without the Shabad, the ego does not depart.
O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam lose their ego; they remain absorbed in the True Lord. ||8||8||30||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Those who are imbued with the True Lord are spotless and pure; their reputation is forever true.
Here, they are known in each and every home, and hereafter, they are famous throughout the ages. ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 081

O beauteous and joyful mind, imbue yourself with your true color.
If you imbue yourself with the Beauteous Word of the Guru's Bani, then this color shall never fade away. ||1||Pause||
I am lowly, filthy, and totally egotistical; I am attached to the corruption of duality.
But meeting with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone, I am transformed into gold; I am blended with the Pure Light of the Infinite Lord. ||2||
Without the Guru, no one is imbued with the color of the Lord's Love; meeting with the Guru, this color is applied.
Those who are imbued with the Fear, and the Love of the Guru, are absorbed in the Praise of the True Lord. ||3||
Without fear, the cloth is not dyed, and the mind is not rendered pure.
Without fear, the performance of rituals is false, and one finds no place of rest. ||4||
Only those whom the Lord imbues, are so imbued; they join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
From the Perfect Guru, the Sat Sangat emanates, and one easily merges into the Love of the True One. ||5||
Without the Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all remain like beasts and animals.
They do not know the One who created them; without the Name, all are thieves. ||6||
Some purchase merits and sell off their demerits; through the Guru, they obtain peace and poise.
Serving the Guru, they obtain the Name, which comes to dwell deep within. ||7||
The One Lord is the Giver of all; He assigns tasks to each and every person.
O Nanak, the Lord embellishes us with the Name; attached to the Word of the Shabad, we are merged into Him. ||8||9||31||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Everyone longs for the Name, but he alone receives it, unto whom the Lord shows His Mercy.
Without the Name, there is only pain; he alone obtains peace, whose mind is filled with the Name. ||1||
You are infinite and merciful; I seek Your Sanctuary.
From the Perfect Guru, the glorious greatness of the Naam is obtained. ||1||Pause||
Inwardly and outwardly, there is only the One Lord. He has created the world, with its many varieties.
According to the Order of His Will, He makes us act. What else can we talk about, O Siblings of Destiny? ||2||
Knowledge and ignorance are all your making; You have control over these.
Some, You forgive, and unite with Yourself; while others, the wicked, you strike down and drive out of Your Court. ||3||
Some, from the very beginning, are pure and pious; You attach them to Your Name.
Serving the Guru, peace wells up; through the True Word of the Shabad, one comes to understand. ||4||
Some are crooked, filthy and vicious; the Lord Himself has led them astray from the Name.
They have no intuition, no understanding and no self-discipline; they wander around delirious. ||5||
He grants faith to those whom He has blessed with His Glance of Grace.
This mind finds truth, contentment and self-discipline, hearing the Immaculate Word of the Shabad. ||6||
By reading books, one cannot reach Him; by speaking and talking, His limits cannot be found.
Through the Guru, His value is found; through the True Word of the Shabad, understanding is obtained. ||7||
So reform this mind and body, by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
O Nanak, within this body is the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; it is found through the Love of the Infinite Guru. ||8||10||32||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The happy soul-brides are imbued with Truth; they are adorned with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 082

They find their Husband Lord within their own home, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Through merits, their demerits are forgiven, and they embrace love for the Lord.
The soul-bride then obtains the Lord as her Husband; meeting the Guru, this union comes about. ||1||Pause||
Some do not know the Presence of their Husband Lord; they are deluded by duality and doubt.
How can the forsaken brides meet Him? Their life night passes in pain. ||2||
Those whose minds are filled with the True Lord, perform truthful actions.
Night and day, they serve the Lord with poise, and are absorbed in the True Lord. ||3||
The forsaken brides wander around, deluded by doubt; telling lies, they eat poison.
They do not know their Husband Lord, and upon their deserted bed, they suffer in misery. ||4||
The True Lord is the One and only; do not be deluded by doubt, O my mind.
Consult with the Guru, serve the True Lord, and enshrine the Immaculate Truth within your mind. ||5||
The happy soul-bride always finds her Husband Lord; she banishes egotism and self-conceit.
She remains attached to her Husband Lord, night and day, and she finds peace upon His Bed of Truth. ||6||
Those who shouted, “Mine, mine!” have departed, without obtaining anything.
The separated one does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and departs, repenting in the end. ||7||
That Husband Lord of mine is the One and only; I am in love with the One alone.
O Nanak, if the soul-bride longs for peace, she should enshrine the Lord's Name within her mind. ||8||11||33||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Those whom the Lord has caused to drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, naturally, intuitively, enjoy the sublime essence.
The True Lord is care-free; he does not have even an iota of greed. ||1||
The True Ambrosial Nectar rains down, and trickles into the mouths of the Gurmukhs.
Their minds are forever rejuvenated, and they naturally, intuitively, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs are forever forsaken brides; they cry out and bewail at the Lord's Gate.
Those who do not enjoy the sublime taste of their Husband Lord, act according to their pre-ordained destiny. ||2||
The Gurmukh plants the seed of the True Name, and it sprouts. He deals in the True Name alone.
Those whom the Lord has attached to this profitable venture, are granted the treasure of devotional worship. ||3||
The Gurmukh is forever the true, happy soul-bride; she adorns herself with the fear of God and devotion to Him.
Night and day, she enjoys her Husband Lord; she keeps Truth enshrined within her heart. ||4||
I am a sacrifice to those who have enjoyed their Husband Lord.
They dwell forever with their Husband Lord; they eradicate self-conceit from within. ||5||
Their bodies and minds are cooled and soothed, and their faces are radiant, from the love and affection of their Husband Lord.
They enjoy their Husband Lord upon His cozy bed, having conquered their ego and desire. ||6||
Granting His Grace, He comes into our homes, through our infinite Love for the Guru.
The happy soul-bride obtains the One Lord as her Husband. ||7||
All of her sins are forgiven; the Uniter unites her with Himself.
O Nanak, chant such chants, that hearing them, He may enshrine love for you. ||8||12||34||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Merit is obtained from the True Guru, when God causes us to meet Him.

Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with intuitive ease and poise, spiritual wisdom is revealed. ||1||
O my mind, do not think of the Lord as being far away; behold Him ever close at hand.
He is always listening, and always watching over us; the Word of His Shabad is all-pervading everywhere. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukhs understand their own selves; they meditate single-mindedly on the Lord.
They enjoy their Husband Lord continually; through the True Name, they find peace. ||2||
O my mind, no one belongs to you; contemplate the Shabad, and see this.
So run to the Lord's Sanctuary, and find the gate of salvation. ||3||
Listen to the Shabad, and understand the Shabad, and lovingly focus your consciousness on the True One.
Through the Shabad, conquer your ego, and in the True Mansion of the Lord's Presence, you shall find peace. ||4||
In this age, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glory; without the Name, there is no glory.
The glory of this Maya lasts for only a few days; it disappears in an instant. ||5||
Those who forget the Naam are already dead, and they continue dying.
They do not enjoy the sublime essence of the Lord's taste; they sink into the manure. ||6||
Some are forgiven by the Lord; He unites them with Himself, and keeps them attached to the Naam, night and day.
They practice Truth, and abide in Truth; being truthful, they merge into Truth. ||7||
Without the Shabad, the world does not hear, and does not see; deaf and blind, it wanders around.
Without the Naam, it obtains only misery; the Naam is received only by His Will. ||8||
Those persons who link their consciousness with the Word of His Bani, are immaculately pure, and approved by the Lord.
O Nanak, they never forget the Naam, and in the Court of the Lord, they are known as true. ||9||13||35||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Through the Word of the Shabad, the devotees are known; their words are true.
They eradicate ego from within themselves; they surrender to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and meet with the True One. ||1||
Through the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, His humble servants obtain honor.
How blessed is their coming into the world! Everyone adores them. ||1||Pause||
Ego, self-centeredness, excessive anger and pride are the lot of mankind.
If one dies in the Word of the Shabad, then he is rid of this, and his light is merged into the Light of the Lord God. ||2||
Meeting with the Perfect True Guru, my life has been blessed.
I have obtained the nine treasures of the Naam, and my storehouse is inexhaustible, filled to overflowing. ||3||
Those who love the Naam come as dealers in the merchandise of the Naam.
Those who become Gurmukh obtain this wealth; deep within, they contemplate the Shabad. ||4||
The egotistical, self-willed manmukhs do not appreciate the value of devotional worship.
The Primal Lord Himself has beguiled them; they lose their lives in the gamble. ||5||
Without loving affection, devotional worship is not possible, and the body cannot be at peace.
The wealth of love is obtained from the Guru; through devotion, the mind becomes steady. ||6||
He alone performs devotional worship, whom the Lord so blesses; he contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The One Name abides in his heart, and he conquers his ego and duality. ||7||
The One Name is the social status and honor of the devotees; the Lord Himself adorns them.
They remain forever in the Protection of His Sanctuary. As it pleases His Will, He arranges their affairs. ||8||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 084

The worship of the Lord is unique - it is known only by reflecting upon the Guru.
O Nanak, one whose mind is filled with the Naam, through the Lord's Fear and devotion, is embellished with the Naam. ||9||14||36||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
He wanders around, engrossed in other pleasures, but without the Naam, he suffers in pain.
He does not meet the True Guru, the Primal Being, who imparts true understanding. ||1||
O my insane mind, drink in the sublime essence of the Lord, and savor its taste.
Attached to other pleasures, you wander around, and your life wastes away uselessly. ||1||Pause||
In this age, the Gurmukhs are pure; they remain absorbed in the love of the True Name.
Without the destiny of good karma, nothing can be obtained; what can we say or do? ||2||
He understands his own self, and dies in the Word of the Shabad; he banishes corruption from his mind.
He hurries to the Guru's Sanctuary, and is forgiven by the Forgiving Lord. ||3||
Without the Name, peace is not obtained, and pain does not depart from within.
This world is engrossed in attachment to Maya; it has gone astray in duality and doubt. ||4||
The forsaken soul-brides do not know the value of their Husband Lord; how can they decorate themselves?
Night and day, they continually burn, and they do not enjoy the Bed of their Husband Lord. ||5||
The happy soul-brides obtain the Mansion of His Presence, eradicating their self-conceit from within.
They decorate themselves with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and their Husband Lord unites them with Himself. ||6||
He has forgotten death, in the darkness of attachment to Maya.
The self-willed manmukhs die again and again, and are reborn; they die again, and are miserable at the Gate of Death. ||7||
They alone are united, whom the Lord unites with Himself; they contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
O Nanak, they are absorbed in the Naam; their faces are radiant, in that True Court. ||8||22||15||37||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When the five virtues were reconciled, and the five passions were estranged, I enshrined the five within myself, and cast out the other five. ||1||
In this way, the village of my body became inhabited, O my Siblings of Destiny.
Vice departed, and the Guru's spiritual wisdom was implanted within me. ||1||Pause||
The fence of true Dharmic religion has been built around it.
The spiritual wisdom and reflective meditation of the Guru has become its strong gate. ||2||
So plant the seed of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O friends, O Siblings of Destiny.
Deal only in the constant service of the Guru. ||3||
With intuitive peace and happiness, all the shops are filled.
The Banker and the dealers dwell in the same place. ||4||
There is no tax on non-believers, nor any fines or taxes at death.
The True Guru has set the Seal of the Primal Lord upon these goods. ||5||
So load the merchandise of the Naam, and set sail with your cargo.
Earn your profit, as Gurmukh, and you shall return to your own home. ||6||
The True Guru is the Banker, and His Sikhs are the traders.
Their merchandise is the Naam, and meditation on the True Lord is their account. ||7||
One who serves the True Guru dwells in this house.
O Nanak, the Divine City is eternal. ||8||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 085

Aasaavaree, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My mind is in love with the Lord.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; my lifestyle is pure and true. ||1||Pause||
I have such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; I think of him in so many ways.
So be Merciful, O Supreme Lord; shower Your Mercy upon me, O Lord, Destroyer of pride. ||1||
My stranger soul has come to join the Saadh Sangat.
That commodity, which I longed for, I have found in the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
There are so many pleasures and delights of Maya, but they pass away in an instant.
Your devotees are imbued with Your Name; they enjoy peace everywhere. ||3||
The entire world is seen to be passing away; only the Lord's Name is lasting and stable.
So make friends with the Holy Saints, so that you may obtain a lasting place of rest. ||4||
Friends, acquaintances, children and relatives - none of these shall be your companion.
The Lord's Name alone shall go with you; God is the Master of the meek. ||5||
The Lord's Lotus Feet are the Boat; attached to Them, you shall cross over the world-ocean.
Meeting with the Perfect True Guru, I embrace True Love for God. ||6||
The prayer of Your Holy Saints is, “May I never forget You, for even one breath or morsel of food.”
Whatever is pleasing to Your Will is good; by Your Sweet Will, my affairs are adjusted. ||7||
I have met my Beloved, the Ocean of Peace, and Supreme Bliss has welled up within me.
Says Nanak, all my pains have been eradicated, meeting with God, the Lord of Supreme Bliss. ||8||1||2||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Birharray ~ Songs Of Separation, To Be Sung In The Tune Of The Chhants. Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Remember the Supreme Lord God, O Beloved, and make yourself a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||
Remembering Him, sorrows are forgotten, O Beloved; how can one forsake Him? ||2||
I would sell this body to the Saint, O Beloved, if he would lead me to my Dear Lord. ||3||
The pleasures and adornments of corruption are insipid and useless; I have forsaken and abandoned them, O my Mother. ||4||
Lust, anger and greed left me, O Beloved, when I fell at the Feet of the True Guru. ||5||
Those humble beings who are imbued with the Lord, O Beloved, do not go anywhere else. ||6||
Those who have tasted the Lord's sublime essence, O Beloved, remain satisfied and satiated. ||7||
One who grasps the Hem of the Gown of the Holy Saint, O Nanak, crosses over the terrible world-ocean. ||8||1||3||
The pains of birth and death are removed, O Beloved, when the mortal meets with the Lord, the King. ||1||
God is so Beautiful, so Refined, so Wise - He is my very life! Reveal to me Your Darshan! ||2||
Those beings who are separated from You, O Beloved, are born only to die; they eat the poison of corruption. ||3||
He alone meets You, whom You cause to meet, O Beloved; I fall at his feet. ||4||
That happiness which one receives by beholding Your Darshan, O Beloved, cannot be described in words. ||5||
True Love cannot be broken, O Beloved; throughout the ages, it remains. ||6||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 086

Whatever pleases You is good, O Beloved; Your Will is Eternal. ||7||
Nanak, those who are imbued with the Love of the All-Pervading Lord, O Beloved, remain intoxicated with His Love, in natural ease. ||8||2||4||
You know all about my condition, O Beloved; who can I speak to about it? ||1||
You are the Giver of all beings; they eat and wear what You give them. ||2||
Pleasure and pain come by Your Will, O Beloved; they do not come from any other. ||3||
Whatever You cause me to do, that I do, O Beloved; I cannot do anything else. ||4||
All my days and nights are blessed, O Beloved, when I chant and meditate on the Lord's Name. ||5||
He does the deeds, O Beloved, which are pre-ordained, and inscribed upon his forehead. ||6||
The One is Himself prevailing everywhere, O Beloved; He is pervading in each and every heart. ||7||
Lift me up out of the deep pit of the world, O Beloved; Nanak has taken to Your Sanctuary. ||8||3||22||15||2||42||
Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Patee Likhee ~ The Poem Of The Alphabet:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Sassa: He who created the world, is the One Lord and Master of all.
Those whose consciousness remains committed to His Service - blessed is their birth and their coming into the world. ||1||
O mind, why forget Him? You foolish mind!
When your account is adjusted, O brother, only then shall you be judged wise. ||1||Pause||
Eevree: The Primal Lord is the Giver; He alone is True.
No accounting is due from the Gurmukh who understands the Lord through these letters. ||2||
Ooraa: Sing the Praises of the One whose limit cannot be found.
Those who perform service and practice truth, obtain the fruits of their rewards. ||3||
Nganga: One who understands spiritual wisdom becomes a Pandit, a religious scholar.

The hunters of the King of Death come, and bind him in the chains of Maya. ||5||
Khakha: The Creator is the King of the world; He enslaves by giving nourishment.
By His Binding, all the world is bound; no other Command prevails. ||6||
Gagga: One who renounces the singing of the songs of the Lord of the Universe, becomes arrogant in his speech.
One who has shaped the pots, and made the world the kiln, decides when to put them in it. ||7||
Ghagha: The servant who performs service, remains attached to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
One who recognizes bad and good as one and the same - in this way he is absorbed into the Lord and Master. ||8||
Chacha: He created the four Vedas, the four sources of creation, and the four ages
\- through each and every age, He Himself has been the Yogi, the enjoyer, the Pandit and the scholar. ||9||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 087

Chhachha: Ignorance exists within everyone; doubt is Your doing, O Lord.
Having created doubt, You Yourself cause them to wander in delusion; those whom You bless with Your Mercy meet with the Guru. ||10||
Jajja: That humble being who begs for wisdom has wandered begging through 8.4 million incarnations.
The One Lord takes away, and the One Lord gives; I have not heard of any other. ||11||
Jhajha: O mortal being, why are you dying of anxiety? Whatever the Lord is to give, He shall keep on giving.
He gives, and gives, and watches over us; according to the Orders which He issues, His beings receive nourishment. ||12||
Nyanya: When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then I do not behold any other.
The One Lord is totally pervading everywhere; the One Lord abides within the mind. ||13||

Don't lose your life in the gamble - hurry to the Lord's Sanctuary. ||14||
T'hat'ha: Peace pervades within those who link their consciousness to the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Those humble beings, whose consciousness is so linked, are saved; by Your Grace, they obtain peace. ||15||
Dadda: Why do you make such ostentatious shows, O mortal? Whatever exists, shall all pass away.
So serve Him, who is contained and pervading among everyone, and you shall obtain peace. ||16||
Dhadha: He Himself establishes and disestablishes; as it pleases His Will, so does He act.
Having created the creation, He watches over it; He issues His Commands, and emancipates those, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace. ||17||
Nanna: One whose heart is filled with the Lord, sings His Glorious Praises.
One whom the Creator Lord unites with Himself, is not consigned to reincarnation. ||18||
Tatta: The terrible world-ocean is so very deep; its limits cannot be found.
I do not have a boat, or even a raft; I am drowning - save me, O Savior King! ||19||
T'hat'ha: In all places and interspaces, He is; everything which exists, is by His doing.
What is doubt? What is called Maya? Whatever pleases Him is good. ||20||
Dadda: Do not blame anyone else; blame instead your own actions.
Whatever I did, for that I have suffered; I do not blame anyone else. ||21||
Dhadha: His power established and upholds the earth; the Lord has imparted His color to everything.
His gifts are received by everyone; all act according to His Command. ||22||

I am called the happy soul-bride, O sister, but my Husband Lord has never met me. ||23||

He sees and understands, and knows everything; inwardly and outwardly, he is fully pervading. ||24||

By Guru's Grace, they alone are saved, who hurry to enter the Lord's Sanctuary. ||25||
Babba: He set out to play the game, on the chess-board of the four ages.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 088

He made all beings and creatures his chessmen, and He Himself threw the dice. ||26||
Bhabha: Those who search, find the fruits of their rewards; by Guru's Grace, they live in the Fear of God.
The self-willed manmukhs wander around, and they do not remember the Lord; the fools are consigned to the cycle of 8.4 million incarnations. ||27||
Mamma: In emotional attachment, he dies; he only thinks of the Lord, the Love of Nectar, when he dies.
As long as the body is alive, he reads other things, and forgets the letter ‘m’, which stands for marnaa - death. ||28||
Yaya: He is never reincarnated again, if he recognizes the True Lord.
The Gurmukh speaks, the Gurmukh understands, and the Gurmukh knows only the One Lord. ||29||
Rarra: The Lord is contained among all; He created all beings.
Having created His beings, He has put them all to work; they alone remember the Naam, upon whom He bestows His Grace. ||30||

We eat and drink; we should endure equally whatever occurs, by His Will, by His Command. ||31||

He beholds, tastes, and knows everything; He is pervading and permeating inwardly and outwardly. ||32||
Rarra: Why do you quarrel, O mortal? Meditate on the Imperishable Lord, and be absorbed into the True One. Become a sacrifice to Him. ||33||
Haha: There is no other Giver than Him; having created the creatures, He gives them nourishment.
Meditate on the Lord's Name, be absorbed into the Lord's Name, and night and day, reap the Profit of the Lord's Name. ||34||
Airaa: He Himself created the world; whatever He has to do, He continues to do.
He acts, and causes others to act, and He knows everything; so says Nanak, the poet. ||35||1||
Raag Aasaa, Third Mehl, Patee - The Alphabet:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Ayo, Angai: The whole world which was created - Kaahkai, Ghangai: It shall pass away.
Reeree, Laalee: People commit sins, and falling into vice, forget virtue. ||1||
O mortal, why have you studied such an account,
which shall call you to answer for payment? ||1||Pause||
Sidhan, Ngaayiyai: You do not remember the Lord. Nanna: You do not take the Lord's Name.
Chhachha: You are wearing away, every night and day; you fool, how will you find release? You are held in the grip of death. ||2||
Babba: You do not understand, you fool; deluded by doubt, you are wasting your life.
Without justification, you call yourself a teacher; thus you take on the loads of others. ||3||
Jajja: You have been robbed of your Light, you fool; in the end, you shall have to depart, and you shall regret and repent.
You have not remembered the One Word of the Shabad, and so you shall have to enter the womb over and over again. ||4||
Read that which is written on your forehead, O Pandit, and do not teach wickedness to others.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 089

First, the teacher is tied down, and then, the noose is placed around the pupil's neck. ||5||
Sassa: You have lost your self-discipline, you fool, and you have accepted an offering under false pretenses.
The daughter of the alms-giver is just like your own; by accepting this payment for performing the wedding ceremony, you have cursed your own life. ||6||
Mamma: You have been cheated out your intellect, you fool, and you are afflicted with the great disease of ego.
Within your innermost self, you do not recognize God, and you compromise yourself for the sake of Maya. ||7||
Kakka: You wander around in sexual desire and anger, you fool; attached to possessiveness, you have forgotten the Lord.
You read, and reflect, and proclaim out loud, but without understanding, you are drowned to death. ||8||
Tatta: In anger, you are burnt, you fool. T'hat'ha: That place where you live, is cursed.
Ghagha: You go begging from door to door, you fool. Dadda: But still, you do not receive the gift. ||9||
Pappa: You shall not be able to swim across, you fool, since you are engrossed in worldly affairs.
The True Lord Himself has ruined you, you fool; this is the destiny written on your forehead. ||10||
Bhabha: You have drowned in the terrifying world-ocean, you fool, and you have become engrossed in Maya.
One who comes to know the One Lord, by Guru's Grace, is carried across in an instant. ||11||
Wawa: Your turn has come, you fool, but you have forgotten the Lord of Light.
This opportunity shall not come again, you fool; you shall fall under the power of the Messenger of Death. ||12||
Jhajha: You shall never have to regret and repent, you fool, if you listen to the Teachings of the True Guru, for even an instant.
Without the True Guru, there is no Guru at all; one who is without a Guru has a bad reputation. ||13||
Dhadha: Restrain your wandering mind, you fool; deep within you the treasure is to be found.
When one becomes Gurmukh, then he drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord; throughout the ages, he continues to drink it in. ||14||
Gagga: Keep the Lord of the Universe in your mind, you fool; by mere words, no one has ever attained Him.
Enshrine the Guru's feet within your heart, you fool, and all your past sins shall be forgiven. ||15||
Haha: Understand the Lord's Sermon, you fool; only then shall you attain eternal peace.
The more the self-willed manmukhs read, the more pain they suffer. Without the True Guru, liberation is not obtained. ||16||
Rarra: Center your consciousness on the Lord, you fool; abide with those whose hearts are filled with the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, those who recognize the Lord, understand the absolute Lord. ||17||
Your limits cannot be known; the indescribable Lord cannot be described.
O Nanak, whose who have met the True Guru, have their accounts settled. ||18||1||2||
Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Chhant, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O beautiful young bride, my Beloved Lord is very playful.
When the bride enshrines great love for her Husband Lord, He becomes merciful, and loves her in return.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 090

The soul-bride meets her Husband Lord, when the Lord Master Himself showers His favor upon her.
Her bed is decorated in the company of her Beloved, and her seven pools are filled with ambrosial nectar.
Be kind and compassionate to me, O Merciful True Lord, that I may obtain the Word of the Shabad, and sing Your Glorious Praises.
O Nanak, gazing upon her Husband Lord, the soul-bride is delighted, and her mind is filled with joy. ||1||
O bride of natural beauty, offer your loving prayers to the Lord.
The Lord is pleasing to my mind and body; I am intoxicated in my Lord God's Company.
Imbued with the Love of God, I pray to the Lord, and through the Lord's Name, I abide in peace.
If you recognize His Glorious Virtues, then you shall come to know God; thus virtue shall dwell in you, and sin shall run away.
Without You, I cannot survive, even for an instant; by merely talking and listening about You, I am not satisfied.
Nanak proclaims, “O Beloved, O Beloved!” His tongue and mind are drenched with the Lord's sublime essence. ||2||
O my companions and friends, my Husband Lord is the merchant.
I have purchased the Lord's Name; its sweetness and value are unlimited.
His value is invaluable; the Beloved dwells in His true home. If it is pleasing to God, then He blesses His bride.
Some enjoy sweet pleasures with the Lord, while I stand crying at His door.
The Creator, the Cause of causes, the All-powerful Lord Himself arranges our affairs.
O Nanak, blessed is the soul-bride, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace; she enshrines the Word of the Shabad in her heart. ||3||
In my home, the true songs of rejoicing resound; the Lord God, my Friend, has come to me.
He enjoys me, and imbued with His Love, I have captivated His heart, and given mine to Him.
I gave my mind, and obtained the Lord as my Husband; as it pleases His Will, He enjoys me.
I have placed my body and mind before my Husband Lord, and through the Shabad, I have been blessed. Within the home of my own self, I have obtained the ambrosial fruit.
He is not obtained by intellectual recitation or great cleverness; only by love does the mind obtain Him.
O Nanak, the Lord Master is my Best Friend; I am not an ordinary person. ||4||1||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The unstruck melody of the sound current resounds with the vibrations of the celestial instruments.
My mind, my mind is imbued with the Love of my Darling Beloved.
Night and day, my detached mind remains absorbed in the Lord, and I obtain my home in the profound trance of the celestial void.
The True Guru has revealed to me the Primal Lord, the Infinite, my Beloved, the Unseen.
The Lord's posture and His seat are permanent; my mind is absorbed in reflective contemplation upon Him.
O Nanak, the detached ones are imbued with His Name, the unstruck melody, and the celestial vibrations. ||1||
Tell me, how can I reach that unreachable, that unreachable city?
By practicing truthfulness and self-restraint, by contemplating His Glorious Virtues, and living the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Practicing the True Word of the Shabad, one comes to the home of his own inner being, and obtains the treasure of virtue.
He has no stems, roots, leaves or branches, but He is the Supreme Lord over the heads of all.
Practicing intensive meditation, chanting and self-discipline, people have grown weary; stubbornly practicing these rituals, they still have not found Him.
O Nanak, through spiritual wisdom, the Lord, the Life of the world, is met; the True Guru imparts this understanding. ||2||
The Guru is the ocean, the mountain of jewels, overflowing with jewels.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 091

Take your bath in the seven seas, O my mind, and become pure.
One bathes in the water of purity when it is pleasing to God, and obtains the five virtues by reflective meditation.
Renouncing sexual desire, anger, deceit and corruption, he enshrines the True Name in his heart.
When the waves of ego, greed and avarice subside, he finds the Lord Master, Merciful to the meek.
O Nanak, there is no place of pilgrimage comparable to the Guru; the True Guru is the Lord of the world. ||3||
I have searched the jungles and forests, and looked upon all the fields.
You created the three worlds, the entire universe, everything.
You created everything; You alone are permanent. Nothing is equal to You.
You are the Giver - all are Your beggars; without You, who should we praise?
You bestow Your gifts, even when we do not ask for them, O Great Giver; devotion to You is a treasure over-flowing.
Without the Lord's Name, there is no liberation; so says Nanak, the meek. ||4||2||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
My mind, my mind is attuned to the Love of my Beloved Lord.
The True Lord Master, the Primal Being, the Infinite One, is the Support of the earth.
He is unfathomable, unapproachable, infinite and incomparable. He is the Supreme Lord God, the Lord above all.
He is the Lord, from the beginning, throughout the ages, now and forevermore; know that all else is false.
If one does not appreciate the value of good deeds and Dharmic faith, how can one obtain clarity of consciousness and liberation?
O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Word of the Shabad; night and day, he meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
My mind, my mind has come to accept, that the Naam is our only Friend.
Egotism, worldly attachment, and the lures of Maya shall not go with you.
Mother, father, famliy, children, cleverness, property and spouses - none of these shall go with you.
I have renounced Maya, the daughter of the ocean; reflecting upon reality, I have trampled it under my feet.
The Primal Lord has revealed this wondrous show; wherever I look, there I see Him.
O Nanak, I shall not forsake the Lord's devotional worship; in the natural course, what shall be, shall be. ||2||
My mind, my mind has become immaculately pure, contemplating the True Lord.
I have dispelled my vices, and now I walk in the company of the virtuous.
Discarding my vices, I do good deeds, and in the True Court, I am judged as true.
My coming and going has come to an end; as Gurmukh, I reflect upon the nature of reality.
O my Dear Friend, You are my all-knowing companion; grant me the glory of Your True Name.
O Nanak, the jewel of the Naam has been revealed to me; such are the Teachings I have received from the Guru. ||3||
I have carefully applied the healing ointment to my eyes, and I am attuned to the Immaculate Lord.
He is permeating my mind and body, the Life of the world, the Lord, the Great Giver.
My mind is imbued with the Lord, the Great Giver, the Life of the world; I have merged and blended with Him, with intuitive ease.
In the Company of the Holy, and the Saints' Society, by God's Grace, peace is obtained.
The renunciates remain absorbed in devotional worship to the Lord; they are rid of emotional attachment and desire.
O Nanak, how rare is that unattached servant, who conquers his ego, and remains pleased with the Lord. ||4||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 092

Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Chhant, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You are everywhere, wherever I go, O True Creator Lord.
You are the Giver of all, the Architect of Destiny, the Dispeller of distress.
The Lord Master is the Dispeller of distress; all that happens is by His doing.
Millions upon millions of sins, He destroys in an instant.
He calls a swan a swan, and a crane a crane; He contemplates each and every heart.
You are everywhere, wherever I go, O True Creator Lord. ||1||
Those who meditate on Him single-mindedly obtain peace; how rare are they in this world.
The Messenger of Death does not draw near those who live the Guru's Teachings; they never return defeated.
Those who appreciate the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, never suffer defeat; the Messenger of Death does not even approach them.
Birth and death are ended for those who are attached to the feet of the Lord.
Through the Guru's Teachings, they obtain the sublime essence of the Lord, and the fruit of the Lord; they enshrine the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in their hearts.
Those who meditate on Him single-mindedly obtain peace; how rare are they in this world. ||2||
He who created the world and assigned all to their tasks - unto Him I am a sacrifice.
So serve Him, and gather profit, and you shall obtain honor in the Court of the Lord.
That humble being, who recognizes the One Lord alone, obtains honor in the Court of the Lord.
One who meditates on the Lord, through the Guru's Teachings, obtains the nine treasures; he chants and repeats continually the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Day and night, take the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the most sublime Primal Being.
The One who created the world and assigned all to their tasks - I am a sacrifice to Him. ||3||

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, First Mehl, Chhant, Third House:
Listen, O black deer: why are you so attached to the orchard of passion?
The fruit of sin is sweet for only a few days, and then it grows hot and bitter.
That fruit which intoxicated you has now become bitter and painful, without the Naam.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 093

It is temporary, like the waves on the sea, and the flash of lightning.
Without the Lord, there is no other protector, but you have forgotten Him.
Nanak speaks the Truth. Reflect upon it, O mind; you shall die, O black deer. ||1||
O bumble bee, you wander among the flowers, but terrible pain awaits you.
I have asked my Guru for true understanding.
I have asked my True Guru for understanding about the bumble bee, who is so involved with the flowers of the garden.
When the sun rises, the body will fall, and it will be cooked in hot oil.
You shall be bound and beaten on the road of Death, without the Word of the Shabad, O madman.
Nanak speaks the Truth. Reflect upon it, O mind; you shall die, O bumble bee. ||2||
O my stranger soul, why do you fall into entanglements?
The True Lord abides within your mind; why are you trapped by the noose of Death?
The fish leaves the water with tearful eyes, when the fisherman casts his net.
The love of Maya is sweet to the world, but in the end, this delusion is dispelled.
So perform devotional worship, link your consciousness to the Lord, and dispel anxiety from your mind.
Nanak speaks the Truth; focus your consciousness on the Lord, O my stranger soul. ||3||
The rivers and streams which separate may sometime be united again.
In age after age, that which is sweet, is full of poison; how rare is the Yogi who understands this.
That rare person who centers his consciousness on the True Guru, knows intuitively and realizes the Lord.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the thoughtless fools wander in doubt, and are ruined.

Eradicating her ego, she obtains her Husband Lord, and then, the sublime essence of the Lord dwells within her mind.
Says Nanak, fruitful and prosperous is her entire life; she is embellished with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
The soul-bride who has been led astray by duality and doubt, does not attain her Husband Lord.
That soul-bride has no virtue, and she wastes her life in vain.
The self-willed, ignorant and disgraceful manmukh wastes her life in vain, and in the end, she comes to grief.
But when she serves her True Guru, she obtains peace, and then she meets her Husband Lord, face to face.
Beholding her Husband Lord, she blossoms forth; her heart is delighted, and she is beautified by the True Word of the Shabad.
O Nanak, without the Name, the soul-bride wanders around, deluded by doubt. Meeting her Beloved, she obtains peace. ||2||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 094

The soul-bride knows that her Husband Lord is with her; the Guru unites her in this union.
Within her heart, she is merged with the Shabad, and the fire of her desire is easily extinguished.
The Shabad has quenched the fire of desire, and within her heart, peace and tranquility have come; she tastes the Lord's essence with intuitive ease.
Meeting her Beloved, she enjoys His Love continually, and her speech rings with the True Shabad.
Reading and studying continually, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the silent sages have grown weary; wearing religious robes, liberation is not obtained.
O Nanak, without devotional worship, the world has gone insane; through the True Word of the Shabad, one meets the Lord. ||3||

O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, we are in bliss forever; meeting the Lord, our affairs are resolved. ||4||1||6||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, Third Mehl, Chhant, Third House:
O my beloved friend, dedicate yourself to the devotional worship of your Husband Lord.
Serve your Guru constantly, and obtain the wealth of the Naam.
Dedicate yourself to the worship of your Husband Lord; this is pleasing to your Beloved Husband.
If you walk in accordance with your own will, then your Husband Lord will not be pleased with you.
This path of loving devotional worship is very difficult; how rare are those who find it, through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate.
Says Nanak, that one, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, links his consciousness to the worship of the Lord. ||1||
O my detached mind, unto whom do you show your detachment?
Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord live in the joy of the Lord, forever and ever.
So become detached, and renounce hypocrisy; Your Husband Lord knows everything.
The One Lord is pervading the water, the land and the sky; the Gurmukh realizes the Command of His Will.
One who realizes the Lord's Command, obtains all peace and comforts.
Thus says Nanak: such a detached soul remains absorbed in the Lord's Love, day and night. ||2||
Wherever you wander, O my mind, the Lord is there with you.
Renounce your cleverness, O my mind, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Your Husband Lord is always with you, if you remember the Lord's Name, even for an instant.
The sins of countless incarnations shall be washed away, and in the end, you shall obtain the supreme status.
You shall be linked to the True Lord, and as Gurmukh, remember Him forever.
Thus says Nanak: wherever you go, O my mind, the Lord is there with you. ||3||
Meeting the True Guru, the wandering mind is held steady; it comes to abide in its own home.
It purchases the Naam, chants the Naam, and remains absorbed in the Naam.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 095

The outgoing, wandering soul, upon meeting the True Guru, opens the Tenth Gate.
There, Ambrosial Nectar is food and the celestial music resounds; the world is held spell-bound by the music of the Word.
The many strains of the unstruck melody resound there, as one merges in Truth.
Thus says Nanak: by meeting the True Guru, the wandering soul becomes steady, and comes to dwell in the home of its own self. ||4||
O my mind, you are the embodiment of the Divine Light - recognize your own origin.
O my mind, the Dear Lord is with you; through the Guru's Teachings, enjoy His Love.
Acknowledge your origin, and then you shall know your Husband Lord, and so understand death and birth.
By Guru's Grace, know the One; then, you shall not love any other.
Peace comes to the mind, and gladness resounds; then, you shall be acclaimed.
Thus says Nanak: O my mind, you are the very image of the Luminous Lord; recognize the true origin of your self. ||5||
O mind, you are so full of pride; loaded with pride, you shall depart.
The fascinating Maya has fascinated you, over and over again, and lured you into reincarnation.
Clinging to pride, you shall depart, O foolish mind, and in the end, you shall regret and repent.
You are afflicted with the diseases of ego and desire, and you are wasting your life away in vain.
The foolish self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord, and shall regret and repent hereafter.
Thus says Nanak: O mind, you are full of pride; loaded with pride, you shall depart. ||6||
O mind, don't be so proud of yourself, as if you know it all; the Gurmukh is humble and modest.
Within the intellect are ignorance and ego; through the True Word of the Shabad, this filth is washed off.
So be humble, and surrender to the True Guru; do not attach your identity to your ego.
The world is consumed by ego and self-identity; see this, lest you lose your own self as well.
Make yourself follow the Sweet Will of the True Guru; remain attached to His Sweet Will.
Thus says Nanak: renounce your ego and self-conceit, and obtain peace; let your mind abide in humility. ||7||
Blessed is that time, when I met the True Guru, and my Husband Lord came into my consciousness.
I became so very blissful, and my mind and body found such a natural peace.
My Husband Lord came into my consciousness; I enshrined Him within my mind, and I renounced all vice.
When it pleased Him, virtues appeared in me, and the True Guru Himself adorned me.
Those humble beings become acceptable, who cling to the One Name and renounce the love of duality.
Thus says Nanak: blessed is the time when I met the True Guru, and my Husband Lord came into my consciousness. ||8||
Some people wander around, deluded by doubt; their Husband Lord Himself has misled them.
They wander around in the love of duality, and they do their deeds in ego.
Their Husband Lord Himself has misled them, and put them on the path of evil. Nothing lies in their power.
You alone know their ups and downs, You, who created the creation.
The Command of Your Will is very strict; how rare is the Gurmukh who understands.
Thus says Nanak: what can the poor creatures do, when You mislead them into doubt? ||9||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 096

O My True Lord Master, True is Your glorious greatness.
You are the Supreme Lord God, the Infinite Lord and Master. Your creative power cannot be described.
True is Your glorious greatness; when You enshrine it within the mind, one sings Your Glorious Praises forever.
He sings Your Glorious Praises, when it is pleasing to You, O True Lord; he centers his consciousness on You.
One whom You unite with Yourself, as Gurmukh, remains absorbed in You.
Thus says Nanak: O my True Lord Master, True is Your Glorious Greatness. ||10||2||7||5||2||7||
Raag Aasaa, Chhant, Fourth Mehl, First House:

The unstruck melody resounds, and the instruments ever vibrate, singing the Bani of the True Guru.
O Nanak, God the Great Giver has given me a gift; He has blended my light into the Light. ||1||
The self-willed manmukhs die in their self-willed stubbornness, declaring that the wealth of Maya is theirs.
They attach their consciousness to the foul-smelling pile of filth, which comes for a moment, and departs in an instant.
They attach their consciousness to the foul-smelling pile of filth, which is transitory, like the fading color of the safflower.
One moment, they are facing east, and the next instant, they are facing west; they continue spinning around, like the potter's wheel.
In sorrow, they eat, and in sorrow, they gather things and try to enjoy them, but they only increase their stores of sorrow.
O Nanak, one easily crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, when he comes to the Sanctuary of the Guru. ||2||
My Lord, my Lord Master is sublime, unapproachable and unfathomable.
The wealth of the Lord - I seek the wealth of the Lord, from my True Guru, the Divine Banker.
I seek the wealth of the Lord, to purchase the Naam; I sing and love the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
I have totally renounced sleep and hunger, and through deep meditation, I am absorbed into the Absolute Lord.
The traders of one kind come and take away the Name of the Lord as their profit.

The great ocean is full of the treasures of jewels upon jewels.
Those who are committed to the Word of the Guru's Bani, see them come into their hands.

Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
Slowly, slowly, slowly, very slowly, the drops of Ambrosial Nectar trickle down.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 097

As Gurmukh, the Gurmukh beholds the Lord, the Beloved Lord.
The Name of the Lord, the Emancipator of the world, is dear to him; the Name of the Lord is his glory.
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the boat, which carries the Gurmukh across.
This world, and the world hereafter, are adorned with the Lord's Name; the Gurmukh's lifestyle is the most excellent.
O Nanak, bestowing His kindness, the Lord gives the gift of His emancipating Name. ||1||
I chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, which destroys my sorrows and erases my sins.
Associating with the Guru, associating with the Guru, I practice meditation; I have enshrined the Lord within my heart.
I enshrined the Lord within my heart, and obtained the supreme status, when I came to the Sanctuary of the Guru.
My boat was sinking under the weight of greed and corruption, but it was uplifted when the True Guru implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me.

The Merciful Lord Himself has mercifully given this gift to me; O Nanak, I take to the Sanctuary of the Guru. ||2||
Hearing the Bani of the Lord's Name, all my affairs were brought to perfection and embellished.
With each and every hair, with each and every hair, as Gurmukh, I meditate on the Lord.
I meditate on the Lord's Name, and become pure; He has no form or shape.
The Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, is permeating my heart deep within, and all of my desire and hunger has disappeared.
My mind and body are totally adorned with peace and tranquility; through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord has been revealed to me.
The Lord Himself has shown His kind mercy to Nanak; He has made me the slave of the slaves of His slaves. ||3||
Those who forget the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, are foolish, unfortunate, self-willed manmukhs.
Within, they are engrossed in emotional attachment; each and every moment, Maya clings to them.
The filth of Maya clings to them, and they become unfortunate fools - they do not love the Lord's Name.
The egotistical and proud perform all sorts of rituals, but they shy away from the Lord's Name.
The path of Death is very arduous and painful; it is stained with the darkness of emotional attachment.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and finds the gate of salvation. ||4||
The Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, and the Lord Guru, are known by the Gurmukh.
One moment, this mind is in the heavens, and the next, it is in the nether regions; the Guru brings the wandering mind back to one-pointedness.
When the mind returns to one-pointedness, one totally understands the value of salvation, and enjoys the subtle essence of the Lord's Name.
The Lord's Name preserves the honor of His servant, as He preserved and emancipated Prahlaad.
So repeat continually the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam; chanting His Glorious Virtues, His limit cannot be found.

Their lives and bodies become totally blessed and fruitful; the Lord's Name illumines them.
O Nanak, by continually vibrating upon the Lord, day and night, the Gurmukhs abide in the home of the inner self. ||6||
Those who place their faith in the Lord's Name, do not attach their consciousness to another.
Even if the entire earth were to be transformed into gold, and given to them, without the Naam, they love nothing else.
The Lord's Name is pleasing to their minds, and they obtain supreme peace; when they depart in the end, it shall go with them as their support.
I have gathered the capital, the wealth of the Lord's Name; it does not sink, and does not depart.
The Lord's Name is the only true support in this age; the Messenger of Death does not draw near it.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs recognize the Lord; in His Mercy, He unites them with Himself. ||7||
True, True is the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam; the Gurmukh knows the Lord.
The Lord's servant is the one who commits himself to the Guru's service, and dedicates his mind and body as an offering to Him.
He dedicates his mind and body to Him, placing great faith in Him; the Guru lovingly unites His servant with Himself.
The Master of the meek, the Giver of souls, is obtained through the Perfect Guru.
The Guru's Sikh, and the Sikh's Guru, are one and the same; both spread the Guru's Teachings.
The Mantra of the Lord's Name is enshrined within the heart, O Nanak, and we merge with the Lord so easily. ||8||2||9||

They enjoy the sublime essence of the Lord, and remain totally detached. By great good fortune, they obtain the sublime essence of the Lord.
So very blessed and truly perfect are those, who through Guru's Instruction meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.

Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:

Then came the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga; men's minds were ruled by power, and they practiced celibacy and self-discipline.
The fourth foot of religion dropped off, and three remained. Their hearts and minds were inflamed with anger.
Their hearts and minds were filled with the horribly poisonous essence of anger. The kings fought their wars and obtained only pain.
Their minds were afflicted with the illness of egotism, and their self-conceit and arrogance increased.
If my Lord, Har, Har, shows His Mercy, my Lord and Master eradicates the poison by the Guru's Teachings and the Lord's Name.
Then came the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga; men's minds were ruled by power, and they practiced celibacy and self-discipline. ||2||

The penitents practiced penance, they offered sacred feasts and charity, and performed many rituals and religious rites.
They performed many rituals and religious rites; two legs of religion dropped away, and only two legs remained.
So many heroes waged great wars; in their egos they were ruined, and they ruined others as well.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 112

I am a sinner, devoid of wisdom, worthless, destitute and vile.
I am deceitful, hard-hearted, lowly and entangled in the mud of emotional attachment.
I am stuck in the filth of doubt and egotistical actions, and I try not to think of death.
In ignorance, I cling to the pleasures of woman and the joys of Maya.
My youth is wasting away, old age is approaching, and Death, my companion, is counting my days.
Prays Nanak, my hope is in You, Lord; please preserve me, the lowly one, in the Sanctuary of the Holy. ||2||
I have wandered through countless incarnations, suffering terrible pain in these lives.
I am entangled in sweet pleasures and gold.
After wandering around with such great loads of sin, I have come, after wandering through so many foreign lands.
Now, I have taken the protection of God, and I have found total peace in the Name of the Lord.
God, my Beloved, is my protector; nothing was done, or will ever be done, by myself alone.

Rise up and go forth, O traveller; why do you delay?
Your allotted time is now complete - why are you engrossed in falsehood?
You desire that which is false; deceived by Maya, you commit innumerable sins.
Your body shall become a pile of dust; the Messenger of Death has spotted you, and will conquer you.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 114

Abandoning your wealth and youth, you will have to leave, without any food or clothing.
O Nanak, only your actions shall go with you; the consequences of your actions cannot be erased. ||1||
Like the deer, captured on a moon-lit night,
so does the constant commission of sins turn pleasure into pain.
The sins you have committed shall not leave you; placing the noose around your neck, they shall lead you away.
Beholding an illusion, you are deceived, and on your bed, you enjoy a false lover.
You are intoxicated with greed, avarice and egotism; you are engrossed in self-conceit.
O Nanak, like the deer, you are being destroyed by your ignorance; your comings and goings shall never end. ||2||
The fly is caught in the sweet candy - how can it fly away?
The elephant has fallen into the pit - how can it escape?
It shall be so difficult to swim across, for one who does not remember the Lord and Master, even for an instant.
His sufferings and punishments are beyond reckoning; he receives the consequences of his own actions.
His secret deeds are exposed, and he is ruined here and hereafter.
O Nanak, without the True Guru, the self-willed egotistical manmukh is defrauded. ||3||
The Lord's slaves live by holding on to God's feet.
The Lord and Master embraces those who seek His Sanctuary.
He blesses them with power, wisdom, knowledge and meditation; He Himself inspires them to chant His Name.

Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Those actions you perform, day and night, are recorded upon your forehead.
And the One, from whom you hide these actions - He sees them, and is always with you.
The Creator Lord is with you; He sees you, so why commit sins?
So perform good deeds, and chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; you shall never have to go to hell.
Twenty-four hours a day, dwell upon the Lord's Name in meditation; it alone shall go along with you.
So vibrate continually in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, and the sins you committed shall be erased. ||1||
Practicing deceit, you fill your belly, you ignorant fool!

The Great Giver is always merciful. Why should we forget the Lord Master from our minds?
Join the Saadh Sangat, and vibrate fearlessly; all your relations shall be saved.

Know in your mind, that the One God is your friend, youth, wealth and everything.
Prays Nanak, by great good fortune, we find the Lord, and merge in peace and celestial poise. ||4||4||13||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Chhant, Eighth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Maya is the wall of doubt - Maya is the wall of doubt. It is such a powerful and destructive intoxicant; it corrupts and wastes away one's life.
In the terrible, impenetrable world-forest - in the terrible, impenetrable world-forest, the thieves are plundering man's house in broad daylight; night and day, this life is being consumed.
The days of your life are being consumed; they are passing away without God. So meet God, the Merciful Lord.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 116

I passed through so many births and deaths; without Union with the Beloved, I did not obtain salvation.
I am without the status of high birth, beauty, glory or spiritual wisdom; without You, who is mine, O Mother?
With my palms pressed together, O Nanak, I enter the Lord's Sanctuary; O beloved almighty Lord and Master, please, save me! ||1||
Like a fish out of water - like a fish out of water, separated from the Lord, the mind and body perish; how can I live, without my Beloved?
Facing the arrow head-on - facing the arrow head-on, the deer surrenders his mind, body and breath of life; he is struck by the hunter's soothing music.
I have enshrined love for my Beloved. In order to meet Him, I have become a renunciate. Cursed is that body which remains without Him, even for an instant.
My eyelids do not close, for I am absorbed in the love of my Beloved. Day and night, my mind thinks only of God.
Attuned to the Lord, intoxicated with the Naam, fear, doubt and duality have all left me.
Bestow Your mercy and compassion, O merciful and perfect Lord, that Nanak may be intoxicated with Your Love. ||2||
The bumble-bee is buzzing - the bumble-bee is buzzing, intoxicated with the honey, the flavor and the fragrance; because of its love for the lotus, it entangles itself.
The mind of the rainbird thirsts - the mind of the rainbird thirsts; its mind longs for the beautiful rain-drops from the clouds. Drinking them in, its fever departs.
O Destroyer of fever, Remover of pain, please unite me with You. My mind and body have such great love for You.
O my beautiful, wise and all-knowing Lord and Master, with what tongue should I chant Your Praises?
Take me by the arm, and grant me Your Name. One who is blessed with Your Glance of Grace, has his sins erased.
Nanak meditates on the Lord, the Purifier of sinners; beholding His Vision, he suffers no more. ||3||
I focus my consciousness on the Lord - I focus my consciousness upon the Lord; I am helpless - please, keep me under Your Protection. I yearn to meet You, my soul hungers for You.
I meditate on Your beautiful body - I meditate on Your beautiful body; my mind is fascinated by Your spiritual wisdom, O Lord of the world. Please, preserve the honor of Your humble servants and beggars.
God bestows perfect honor and destroys pain; He has fulfilled all my desires.
How very blessed was that day when the Lord embraced me; meeting my Husband Lord, my bed was beautified.
When God granted His Grace and met me, all my sins were erased.
Prays Nanak, my hopes are fulfilled; I have met the Lord, the Lord of Lakshmi, the treasure of excellence. ||4||1||14||

A hundred times a day, I am a sacrifice to my Guru;
He made angels out of men, without delay. ||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 117

Second Mehl:
If a hundred moons were to rise, and a thousand suns appeared,
even with such light, there would still be pitch darkness without the Guru. ||2||
First Mehl:
O Nanak, those who do not think of the Guru, and who think of themselves as clever,
shall be left abandoned in the field, like the scattered sesame.
They are abandoned in the field, says Nanak, and they have a hundred masters to please.
The wretches bear fruit and flower, but within their bodies, they are filled with ashes. ||3||
Pauree:
He Himself created Himself; He Himself assumed His Name.
Secondly, He fashioned the creation; seated within the creation, He beholds it with delight.
You Yourself are the Giver and the Creator; by Your Pleasure, You bestow Your Mercy.
You are the Knower of all; You give life, and take it away again with a word.
Seated within the creation, You behold it with delight. ||1||
Shalok, First Mehl:
True are Your worlds, True are Your solar Systems.
True are Your realms, True is Your creation.
True are Your actions, and all Your deliberations.
True is Your Command, and True is Your Court.
True is the Command of Your Will, True is Your Order.
True is Your Mercy, True is Your Insignia.
Hundreds of thousands and millions call You True.
In the True Lord is all power, in the True Lord is all might.
True is Your Praise, True is Your Adoration.
True is Your almighty creative power, True King.
O Nanak, true are those who meditate on the True One.
Those who are subject to birth and death are totally false. ||1||
First Mehl:
Great is His greatness, as great as His Name.
Great is His greatness, as True is His justice.
Great is His greatness, as permanent as His Throne.
Great is His greatness, as He knows our utterances.
Great is His greatness, as He understands all our affections.

Whatever He has done, or will do, is all by His Own Will. ||2||
Second Mehl:
This world is the room of the True Lord; within it is the dwelling of the True Lord.
By His Command, some are merged into Him, and some, by His Command, are destroyed.
Some, by the Pleasure of His Will, are lifted up out of Maya, while others are made to dwell within it.
No one can say who will be rescued.
O Nanak, he alone is known as Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord reveals Himself. ||3||
Pauree:
O Nanak, having created the souls, the Lord installed the Righteous Judge of Dharma to read and record their accounts.
There, only the Truth is judged true; the sinners are picked out and separated.
The false find no place there, and they go to hell with their faces blackened.
Those who are imbued with Your Name win, while the cheaters lose.
The Lord installed the Righteous Judge of Dharma to read and record the accounts. ||2||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Wonderful is the sound current of the Naad, wonderful is the knowledge of the Vedas.
Wonderful are the beings, wonderful are the species.
Wonderful are the forms, wonderful are the colors.
Wonderful are the beings who wander around naked.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 118

Wonderful is the wind, wonderful is the water.
Wonderful is fire, which works wonders.
Wonderful is the earth, wonderful the sources of creation.
Wonderful are the tastes to which mortals are attached.
Wonderful is union, and wonderful is separation.
Wonderful is hunger, wonderful is satisfaction.
Wonderful is His Praise, wonderful is His adoration.
Wonderful is the wilderness, wonderful is the path.
Wonderful is closeness, wonderful is distance.
How wonderful to behold the Lord, ever-present here.
Beholding His wonders, I am wonder-struck.
O Nanak, those who understand this are blessed with perfect destiny. ||1||
First Mehl:
By His Power we see, by His Power we hear; by His Power we have fear, and the essence of happiness.

By His Power wind, water and fire exist; by His Power earth and dust exist.
Everything is in Your Power, Lord; You are the all-powerful Creator. Your Name is the Holiest of the Holy.
O Nanak, through the Command of His Will, He beholds and pervades the creation; He is absolutely unrivalled. ||2||
Pauree:
Enjoying his pleasures, one is reduced to a pile of ashes, and the soul passes away.
He may be great, but when he dies, the chain is thrown around his neck, and he is led away.
There, his good and bad deeds are added up; sitting there, his account is read.
He is whipped, but finds no place of rest, and no one hears his cries of pain.
The blind man has wasted his life away. ||3||
Shalok, First Mehl:
In the Fear of God, the wind and breezes ever blow.
In the Fear of God, thousands of rivers flow.
In the Fear of God, fire is forced to labor.
In the Fear of God, the earth is crushed under its burden.
In the Fear of God, the clouds move across the sky.
In the Fear of God, the Righteous Judge of Dharma stands at His Door.
In the Fear of God, the sun shines, and in the Fear of God, the moon reflects.
They travel millions of miles, endlessly.
In the Fear of God, the Siddhas exist, as do the Buddhas, the demi-gods and Yogis.
In the Fear of God, the Akaashic ethers are stretched across the sky.
In the Fear of God, the warriors and the most powerful heroes exist.
In the Fear of God, multitudes come and go.
God has inscribed the Inscription of His Fear upon the heads of all.
O Nanak, the Fearless Lord, the Formless Lord, the True Lord, is One. ||1||
First Mehl:
O Nanak, the Lord is fearless and formless; myriads of others, like Rama, are mere dust before Him.
There are so many stories of Krishna, so many who reflect over the Vedas.
So many beggars dance, spinning around to the beat.
The magicians perform their magic in the market place, creating a false illusion.
They sing as kings and queens, and speak of this and that.
They wear earrings, and necklaces worth thousands of dollars.
Those bodies on which they are worn, O Nanak, those bodies turn to ashes.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 119

Wisdom cannot be found through mere words. To explain it is as hard as iron.
When the Lord bestows His Grace, then alone it is received; other tricks and orders are useless. ||2||
Pauree:
If the Merciful Lord shows His Mercy, then the True Guru is found.
This soul wandered through countless incarnations, until the True Guru instructed it in the Word of the Shabad.
There is no giver as great as the True Guru; hear this, all you people.
Meeting the True Guru, the True Lord is found; He removes self-conceit from within,
and instructs us in the Truth of Truths. ||4||
Shalok, First Mehl:
All the hours are the milk-maids, and the quarters of the day are the Krishnas.
The wind, water and fire are the ornaments; the sun and moon are the incarnations.
All of the earth, property, wealth and articles are all entanglements.
O Nanak, without divine knowledge, one is plundered, and devoured by the Messenger of Death. ||1||
First Mehl:
The disciples play the music, and the gurus dance.
They move their feet and roll their heads.
The dust flies and falls upon their hair.
Beholding them, the people laugh, and then go home.
They beat the drums for the sake of bread.
They throw themselves upon the ground.
They sing of the milk-maids, they sing of the Krishnas.
They sing of Sitas, and Ramas and kings.
The Lord is fearless and formless; His Name is True.
The entire universe is His Creation.
Those servants, whose destiny is awakened, serve the Lord.
The night of their lives is cool with dew; their minds are filled with love for the Lord.
Contemplating the Guru, I have been taught these teachings;
granting His Grace, He carries His servants across.
The oil-press, the spinning wheel, the grinding stones, the potter's wheel,
the numerous, countless whirlwinds in the desert,
the spinning tops, the churning sticks, the threshers,
the breathless tumblings of the birds,
and the men moving round and round on spindles
\- O Nanak, the tumblers are countless and endless.
The Lord binds us in bondage - so do we spin around.
According to their actions, so do all people dance.
Those who dance and dance and laugh, shall weep on their ultimate departure.
They do not fly to the heavens, nor do they become Siddhas.
They dance and jump around on the urgings of their minds.
O Nanak, those whose minds are filled with the Fear of God, have the love of God in their minds as well. ||2||
Pauree:
Your Name is the Fearless Lord; chanting Your Name, one does not have to go to hell.
Soul and body all belong to Him; asking Him to give us sustenance is a waste.
If you yearn for goodness, then perform good deeds and feel humble.
Even if you remove the signs of old age, old age shall still come in the guise of death.
No one remains here when the count of the breaths is full. ||5||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The Muslims praise the Islamic law; they read and reflect upon it.
The Lord's bound servants are those who bind themselves to see the Lord's Vision.
The Hindus praise the Praiseworthy Lord; the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, His form is incomparable.
They bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, making offerings of flowers, and burning incense before idols.
The Yogis meditate on the absolute Lord there; they call the Creator the Unseen Lord.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 120

But to the subtle image of the Immaculate Name, they apply the form of a body.
In the minds of the virtuous, contentment is produced, thinking about their giving.
They give and give, but ask a thousand-fold more, and hope that the world will honor them.
The thieves, adulterers, perjurers, evil-doers and sinners
\- after using up what good karma they had, they depart; have they done any good deeds here at all?
There are beings and creatures in the water and on the land, in the worlds and universes, form upon form.
Whatever they say, You know; You care for them all.
O Nanak, the hunger of the devotees is to praise You; the True Name is their only support.
They live in eternal bliss, day and night; they are the dust of the feet of the virtuous. ||1||
First Mehl:
The clay of the Muslim's grave becomes clay for the potter's wheel.
Pots and bricks are fashioned from it, and it cries out as it burns.
The poor clay burns, burns and weeps, as the fiery coals fall upon it.
O Nanak, the Creator created the creation; the Creator Lord alone knows. ||2||
Pauree:
Without the True Guru, no one has obtained the Lord; without the True Guru, no one has obtained the Lord.
He has placed Himself within the True Guru; revealing Himself, He declares this openly.
Meeting the True Guru, eternal liberation is obtained; He has banished attachment from within.
This is the highest thought, that one's consciousness is attached to the True Lord.
Thus the Lord of the World, the Great Giver is obtained. ||6||
Shalok, First Mehl:
In ego they come, and in ego they go.
In ego they are born, and in ego they die.

In ego they earn, and in ego they lose.
In ego they become truthful or false.
In ego they reflect on virtue and sin.
In ego they go to heaven or hell.
In ego they laugh, and in ego they weep.
In ego they become dirty, and in ego they are washed clean.
In ego they lose social status and class.
In ego they are ignorant, and in ego they are wise.
They do not know the value of salvation and liberation.
In ego they love Maya, and in ego they are kept in darkness by it.
Living in ego, mortal beings are created.
When one understands ego, then the Lord's gate is known.
Without spiritual wisdom, they babble and argue.
O Nanak, by the Lord's Command, destiny is recorded.
As the Lord sees us, so are we seen. ||1||
Second Mehl:
This is the nature of ego, that people perform their actions in ego.
This is the bondage of ego, that time and time again, they are reborn.
Where does ego come from? How can it be removed?
This ego exists by the Lord's Order; people wander according to their past actions.
Ego is a chronic disease, but it contains its own cure as well.
If the Lord grants His Grace, one acts according to the Teachings of the Guru's Shabad.
Nanak says, listen, people: in this way, troubles depart. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who serve are content. They meditate on the Truest of the True.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 121

They do not place their feet in sin, but do good deeds and live righteously in Dharma.
They burn away the bonds of the world, and eat a simple diet of grain and water.
You are the Great Forgiver; You give continually, more and more each day.
By His greatness, the Great Lord is obtained. ||7||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Men, trees, sacred shrines of pilgrimage, banks of sacred rivers, clouds, fields,
islands, continents, worlds, solar systems, and universes;
the four sources of creation - born of eggs, born of the womb, born of the earth and born of sweat;
oceans, mountains, and all beings - O Nanak, He alone knows their condition.
O Nanak, having created the living beings, He cherishes them all.
The Creator who created the creation, takes care of it as well.
He, the Creator who formed the world, cares for it.
Unto Him I bow and offer my reverence; His Royal Court is eternal.
O Nanak, without the True Name, of what use is the frontal mark of the Hindus, or their sacred thread? ||1||
First Mehl:
Hundreds of thousands of virtues and good actions, and hundreds of thousands of blessed charities,
hundreds of thousands of penances at sacred shrines, and the practice of Sehj Yoga in the wilderness,
hundreds of thousands of courageous actions and giving up the breath of life on the field of battle,
hundreds of thousands of divine understandings, hundreds of thousands of divine wisdoms and meditations and readings of the Vedas and the Puraanas
\- before the Creator who created the creation, and who ordained coming and going,
O Nanak, all these things are false. True is the Insignia of His Grace. ||2||
Pauree:
You alone are the True Lord. The Truth of Truths is pervading everywhere.
He alone receives the Truth, unto whom You give it; then, he practices Truth.
Meeting the True Guru, Truth is found. In His Heart, Truth is abiding.
The fools do not know the Truth. The self-willed manmukhs waste their lives away in vain.
Why have they even come into the world? ||8||
Shalok, First Mehl:
You may read and read loads of books; you may read and study vast multitudes of books.
You may read and read boat-loads of books; you may read and read and fill pits with them.
You may read them year after year; you may read them as many months are there are.
You may read them all your life; you may read them with every breath.
O Nanak, only one thing is of any account: everything else is useless babbling and idle talk in ego. ||1||
First Mehl:
The more one write and reads,
the more one burns.
The more one wanders at sacred shrines of pilgrimage,
the more one talks uselessly.
The more one wears religious robes, the more pain he causes his body.
O my soul, you must endure the consequences of your own actions.
One who does not eat the corn, misses out on the taste.
One obtains great pain, in the love of duality.
One who does not wear any clothes,
suffers night and day.
Through silence, he is ruined.
How can the sleeping one be awakened without the Guru?
One who goes barefoot
suffers by his own actions.
One who eats filth and throws ashes on his head
\- the blind fool loses his honor.
Without the Name, nothing is of any use.
One who lives in the wilderness, in cemetaries and cremation grounds
\- that blind man does not know the Lord; he regrets and repents in the end.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 122

One who meets the True Guru finds peace.
He enshrines the Name of the Lord in his mind.
O Nanak, when the Lord grants His Grace, He is obtained.
He becomes free of hope and fear, and burns away his ego with the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
Pauree:
Your devotees are pleasing to Your Mind, Lord. They look beautiful at Your door, singing Your Praises.
O Nanak, those who are denied Your Grace, find no shelter at Your Door; they continue wandering.
Some do not understand their origins, and without cause, they display their self-conceit.
I am the Lord's minstrel, of low social status; others call themselves high caste.
I seek those who meditate on You. ||9||
Shalok, First Mehl:
False is the king, false are the subjects; false is the whole world.
False is the mansion, false are the skyscrapers; false are those who live in them.
False is gold, and false is silver; false are those who wear them.
False is the body, false are the clothes; false is incomparable beauty.
False is the husband, false is the wife; they mourn and waste away.
The false ones love falsehood, and forget their Creator.
With whom should I become friends, if all the world shall pass away?
False is sweetness, false is honey; through falsehood, boat-loads of men have drowned.
Nanak speaks this prayer: without You, Lord, everything is totally false. ||1||
First Mehl:
One knows the Truth only when the Truth is in his heart.
The filth of falsehood departs, and the body is washed clean.
One knows the Truth only when he bears love to the True Lord.
Hearing the Name, the mind is enraptured; then, he attains the gate of salvation.
One knows the Truth only when he knows the true way of life.
Preparing the field of the body, he plants the Seed of the Creator.
One knows the Truth only when he receives true instruction.
Showing mercy to other beings, he makes donations to charities.
One knows the Truth only when he dwells in the sacred shrine of pilgrimage of his own soul.
He sits and receives instruction from the True Guru, and lives in accordance with His Will.
Truth is the medicine for all; it removes and washes away our sins.
Nanak speaks this prayer to those who have Truth in their laps. ||2||
Pauree:
The gift I seek is the dust of the feet of the Saints; if I were to obtain it, I would apply it to my forehead.
Renounce false greed, and meditate single-mindedly on the unseen Lord.
As are the actions we commit, so are the rewards we receive.
If it is so pre-ordained, then one obtains the dust of the feet of the Saints.
But through small-mindedness, we forfeit the merits of selfless service. ||10||
Shalok, First Mehl:
There is a famine of Truth; falsehood prevails, and the blackness of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga has turned men into demons.
Those who planted their seed have departed with honor; now, how can the shattered seed sprout?
If the seed is whole, and it is the proper season, then the seed will sprout.
O Nanak, without treatment, the raw fabric cannot be dyed.
In the Fear of God it is bleached white, if the treatment of modesty is applied to the cloth of the body.
O Nanak, if one is imbued with devotional worship, his reputation is not false. ||1||
First Mehl:
Greed and sin are the king and prime minister; falsehood is the treasurer.
Sexual desire, the chief advisor, is summoned and consulted; they all sit together and contemplate their plans.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 123

Their subjects are blind, and without wisdom, they try to please the will of the dead.
The spiritually wise dance and play their musical instruments, adorning themselves with beautiful decorations.
They shout out loud, and sing epic poems and heroic stories.
The fools call themselves spiritual scholars, and by their clever tricks, they love to gather wealth.
The righteous waste their righteousness, by asking for the door of salvation.
They call themselves celibate, and abandon their homes, but they do not know the true way of life.
Everyone calls himself perfect; none call themselves imperfect.
If the weight of honor is placed on the scale, then, O Nanak, one sees his true weight. ||2||
First Mehl:
Evil actions become publicly known; O Nanak, the True Lord sees everything.
Everyone makes the attempt, but that alone happens which the Creator Lord does.
In the world hereafter, social status and power mean nothing; hereafter, the soul is new.
Those few, whose honor is confirmed, are good. ||3||
Pauree:
Only those whose karma You have pre-ordained from the very beginning, O Lord, meditate on You.
Nothing is in the power of these beings; You created the various worlds.
Some, You unite with Yourself, and some, You lead astray.
By Guru's Grace You are known; through Him, You reveal Yourself.
We are easily absorbed in You. ||11||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Suffering is the medicine, and pleasure the disease, because where there is pleasure, there is no desire for God.
You are the Creator Lord; I can do nothing. Even if I try, nothing happens. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to Your almighty creative power which is pervading everywhere.
Your limits cannot be known. ||1||Pause||
Your Light is in Your creatures, and Your creatures are in Your Light; Your almighty power is pervading everywhere.
You are the True Lord and Master; Your Praise is so beautiful. One who sings it, is carried across.
Nanak speaks the stories of the Creator Lord; whatever He is to do, He does. ||2||
Second Mehl:
The Way of Yoga is the Way of spiritual wisdom; the Vedas are the Way of the Brahmins.
The Way of the Khshatriya is the Way of bravery; the Way of the Shudras is service to others.
The Way of all is the Way of the One; Nanak is a slave to one who knows this secret; he himself is the Immaculate Divine Lord. ||3||
Second Mehl:
The One Lord Krishna is the Divine Lord of all; He is the Divinity of the individual soul.
Nanak is a slave to anyone who understands this mystery of the all-pervading Lord; he himself is the Immaculate Divine Lord. ||4||
First Mehl:
Water remains confined within the pitcher, but without water, the pitcher could not have been formed;
just so, the mind is restrained by spiritual wisdom, but without the Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom. ||5||
Pauree:
If an educated person is a sinner, then the illiterate holy man is not to be punished.
As are the deeds done, so is the reputation one acquires.
So do not play such a game, which will bring you to ruin at the Court of the Lord.
The accounts of the educated and the illiterate shall be judged in the world hereafter.
One who stubbornly follows his own mind shall suffer in the world hereafter. ||12||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 124

Shalok, First Mehl:
O Nanak, the soul of the body has one chariot and one charioteer.
In age after age they change; the spiritually wise understand this.
In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, contentment was the chariot and righteousness the charioteer.
In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, celibacy was the chariot and power the charioteer.
In the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga, penance was the chariot and truth the charioteer.
In the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, fire is the chariot and falsehood the charioteer. ||1||
First Mehl:
The Sama Veda says that the Lord Master is robed in white; in the Age of Truth, everyone desired Truth, abided in Truth, and was merged in the Truth.
The Rig Veda says that God is permeating and pervading everywhere;
among the deities, the Lord's Name is the most exalted.
Chanting the Name, sins depart;
O Nanak, then, one obtains salvation.
In the Jujar Veda, Kaan Krishna of the Yaadva tribe seduced Chandraavali by force.
He brought the Elysian Tree for his milk-maid, and revelled in Brindaaban.
In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Atharva Veda became prominent; Allah became the Name of God.
Men began to wear blue robes and garments; Turks and Pat'haans assumed power.
The four Vedas each claim to be true.
Reading and studying them, four doctrines are found.
With loving devotional worship, abiding in humility, O Nanak, salvation is attained. ||2||
Pauree:
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru; meeting Him, I have come to cherish the Lord Master.
He has taught me and given me the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom, and with these eyes, I behold the world.
Those dealers who abandon their Lord and Master and attach themselves to another, are drowned.
The True Guru is the boat, but few are those who realize this.
Granting His Grace, He carries them across. ||13||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The simmal tree is straight as an arrow; it is very tall, and very thick.
But those birds which visit it hopefully, depart disappointed.
Its fruits are tasteless, its flowers are nauseating, and its leaves are useless.
Sweetness and humility, O Nanak, are the essence of virtue and goodness.
Everyone bows down to himself; no one bows down to another.
When something is placed on the balancing scale and weighed, the side which descends is heavier.
The sinner, like the deer hunter, bows down twice as much.
But what can be achieved by bowing the head, when the heart is impure? ||1||
First Mehl:
You read your books and say your prayers, and then engage in debate;
you worship stones and sit like a stork, pretending to be in Samaadhi.
With your mouth you utter falsehood, and you adorn yourself with precious decorations;
you recite the three lines of the Gayatri three times a day.
Around your neck is a rosary, and on your forehead is a sacred mark;
upon your head is a turban, and you wear two loin cloths.
If you knew the nature of God,
you would know that all of these beliefs and rituals are in vain.
Says Nanak, meditate with deep faith;
without the True Guru, no one finds the Way. ||2||
Pauree:
Abandoning the world of beauty, and beautiful clothes, one must depart.
He obtains the rewards of his good and bad deeds.
He may issue whatever commands he wishes, but he shall have to take to the narrow path hereafter.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 125

He goes to hell naked, and he looks hideous then.
He regrets the sins he committed. ||14||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Make compassion the cotton, contentment the thread, modesty the knot and truth the twist.
This is the sacred thread of the soul; if you have it, then go ahead and put it on me.
It does not break, it cannot be soiled by filth, it cannot be burnt, or lost.
Blessed are those mortal beings, O Nanak, who wear such a thread around their necks.
You buy the thread for a few shells, and seated in your enclosure, you put it on.
Whispering instructions into others' ears, the Brahmin becomes a guru.
But he dies, and the sacred thread falls away, and the soul departs without it. ||1||
First Mehl:
He commits thousands of robberies, thousands of acts of adultery, thousands of falsehoods and thousands of abuses.
He practices thousands of deceptions and secret deeds, night and day, against his fellow beings.
The thread is spun from cotton, and the Brahmin comes and twists it.
The goat is killed, cooked and eaten, and everyone then says, “Put on the sacred thread.”
When it wears out, it is thrown away, and another one is put on.
O Nanak, the thread would not break, if it had any real strength. ||2||
First Mehl:
Believing in the Name, honor is obtained. The Lord's Praise is the true sacred thread.
Such a sacred thread is worn in the Court of the Lord; it shall never break. ||3||
First Mehl:
There is no sacred thread for the sexual organ, and no thread for woman.
The man's beard is spat upon daily.
There is no sacred thread for the feet, and no thread for the hands;
no thread for the tongue, and no thread for the eyes.
The Brahmin himself goes to the world hereafter without a sacred thread.
Twisting the threads, he puts them on others.
He takes payment for performing marriages;
reading their horoscopes, he shows them the way.
Hear, and see, O people, this wondrous thing.
He is mentally blind, and yet his name is wisdom. ||4||
Pauree:
One, upon whom the Merciful Lord bestows His Grace, performs His service.
That servant, whom the Lord causes to obey the Order of His Will, serves Him.
Obeying the Order of His Will, he becomes acceptable, and then, he obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
One who acts to please His Lord and Master, obtains the fruits of his mind's desires.
Then, he goes to the Court of the Lord, wearing robes of honor. ||15||
Shalok, First Mehl:
They tax the cows and the Brahmins, but the cow-dung they apply to their kitchen will not save them.
They wear their loin cloths, apply ritual frontal marks to their foreheads, and carry their rosaries, but they eat food with the Muslims.
O Siblings of Destiny, you perform devotional worship indoors, but read the Islamic sacred texts, and adopt the Muslim way of life.
Renounce your hypocrisy!
Taking the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you shall swim across. ||1||
First Mehl:
The man-eaters say their prayers.
Those who wield the knife wear the sacred thread around their necks.
In their homes, the Brahmins sound the conch.
They too have the same taste.
False is their capital, and false is their trade.
Speaking falsehood, they take their food.
The home of modesty and Dharma is far from them.
O Nanak, they are totally permeated with falsehood.
The sacred marks are on their foreheads, and the saffron loin-cloths are around their waists;
in their hands they hold the knives - they are the butchers of the world!

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 126

Wearing blue robes, they seek the approval of the Muslim rulers.
Accepting bread from the Muslim rulers, they still worship the Puraanas.
They eat the meat of the goats, killed after the Muslim prayers are read over them,
but they do not allow anyone else to enter their kitchen areas.
They draw lines around them, plastering the ground with cow-dung.
The false come and sit within them.
They cry out, “Do not touch our food, or it will be polluted!”
But with their polluted bodies, they commit evil deeds.
With filthy minds, they try to cleanse their mouths.
Says Nanak, meditate on the True Lord.
If you are pure, you will obtain the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
All are within Your mind; You see and move them under Your Glance of Grace, O Lord.
You Yourself grant them glory, and You Yourself cause them to act.
The Lord is the greatest of the great; great is His world. He enjoins all to their tasks.
If he should cast an angry glance, He can transform kings into blades of grass.
Even though they may beg from door to door, no one will give them charity. ||16||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The thief robs a house, and offers the stolen goods to his ancestors.
In the world hereafter, this is recognized, and his ancestors are considered thieves as well.
The hands of the go-between are cut off; this is the Lord's justice.
O Nanak, in the world hereafter, that alone is received, which one gives to the needy from his own earnings and labor. ||1||
First Mehl:
As a woman has her periods, month after month,
so does falsehood dwell in the mouth of the false; they suffer forever, again and again.
They are not called pure, who sit down after merely washing their bodies.
Only they are pure, O Nanak, within whose minds the Lord abides. ||2||
Pauree:
With saddled horses, as fast as the wind, and harems decorated in every way;
in houses and pavilions and lofty mansions, they dwell, making ostentatious shows.
They act out their minds' desires, but they do not understand the Lord, and so they are ruined.
Asserting their authority, they eat, and beholding their mansions, they forget about death.
But old age comes, and youth is lost. ||17||
Shalok, First Mehl:
If one accepts the concept of impurity, then there is impurity everywhere.
In cow-dung and wood there are worms.
As many as are the grains of corn, none is without life.
First, there is life in the water, by which everything else is made green.
How can it be protected from impurity? It touches our own kitchen.
O Nanak, impurity cannot be removed in this way; it is washed away only by spiritual wisdom. ||1||
First Mehl:
The impurity of the mind is greed, and the impurity of the tongue is falsehood.
The impurity of the eyes is to gaze upon the beauty of another man's wife, and his wealth.
The impurity of the ears is to listen to the slander of others.
O Nanak, the mortal's soul goes, bound and gagged to the city of Death. ||2||
First Mehl:
All impurity comes from doubt and attachment to duality.
Birth and death are subject to the Command of the Lord's Will; through His Will we come and go.
Eating and drinking are pure, since the Lord gives nourishment to all.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs, who understand the Lord, are not stained by impurity. ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 127

Pauree:
Praise the Great True Guru; within Him is the greatest greatness.
When the Lord causes us to meet the Guru, then we come to see them.
When it pleases Him, they come to dwell in our minds.
By His Command, when He places His hand on our foreheads, wickedness departs from within.
When the Lord is thoroughly pleased, the nine treasures are obtained. ||18||
Shalok, First Mehl:
First, purifying himself, the Brahmin comes and sits in his purified enclosure.
The pure foods, which no one else has touched, are placed before him.
Being purified, he takes his food, and begins to read his sacred verses.
But it is then thrown into a filthy place - whose fault is this?
The corn is sacred, the water is sacred; the fire and salt are sacred as well; when the fifth thing, the ghee, is added,
then the food becomes pure and sanctified.
Coming into contact with the sinful human body, the food becomes so impure that is is spat upon.
That mouth which does not chant the Naam, and without the Name eats tasty foods
\- O Nanak, know this: such a mouth is to be spat upon. ||1||
First Mehl:
From woman, man is born; within woman, man is conceived; to woman he is engaged and married.
Woman becomes his friend; through woman, the future generations come.
When his woman dies, he seeks another woman; to woman he is bound.
So why call her bad? From her, kings are born.
From woman, woman is born; without woman, there would be no one at all.
O Nanak, only the True Lord is without a woman.
That mouth which praises the Lord continually is blessed and beautiful.
O Nanak, those faces shall be radiant in the Court of the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
All call You their own, Lord; one who does not own You, is picked up and thrown away.
Everyone receives the rewards of his own actions; his account is adjusted accordingly.
Since one is not destined to remain in this world anyway, why should he ruin himself in pride?
Do not call anyone bad; read these words, and understand.
Don't argue with fools. ||19||
Shalok, First Mehl:
O Nanak, speaking insipid words, the body and mind become insipid.
He is called the most insipid of the insipid; the most insipid of the insipid is his reputation.
The insipid person is discarded in the Court of the Lord, and the insipid one's face is spat upon.
The insipid one is called a fool; he is beaten with shoes in punishment. ||1||
First Mehl:
Those who are false within, and honorable on the outside, are very common in this world.
Even though they may bathe at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, still, their filth does not depart.
Those who have silk on the inside and rags on the outside, are the good ones in this world.
They embrace love for the Lord, and contemplate beholding Him.
In the Lord's Love, they laugh, and in the Lord's Love, they weep, and also keep silent.
They do not care for anything else, except their True Husband Lord.
Sitting, waiting at the Lord's Door, they beg for food, and when He gives to them, they eat.
There is only One Court of the Lord, and He has only one pen; there, you and I shall meet.
In the Court of the Lord, the accounts are examined; O Nanak, the sinners are crushed, like oil seeds in the press. ||2||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 128

Pauree:
You Yourself created the creation; You Yourself infused Your power into it.
You behold Your creation, like the losing and winning dice of the earth.
Whoever has come, shall depart; all shall have their turn.
He who owns our soul, and our very breath of life - why should we forget that Lord and Master from our minds?
With our own hands, let us resolve our own affairs. ||20||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
What sort of love is this, which clings to duality?
O Nanak, he alone is called a lover, who remains forever immersed in absorption.
But one who feels good only when good is done for him, and feels bad when things go badly
\- do not call him a lover. He trades only for his own account. ||1||
Second Mehl:
One who offers both respectful greetings and rude refusal to his master, has gone wrong from the very beginning.
O Nanak, both of his actions are false; he obtains no place in the Court of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
Serving Him, peace is obtained; meditate and dwell upon that Lord and Master forever.
Why do you do such evil deeds, that you shall have to suffer so?
Do not do any evil at all; look ahead to the future with foresight.
So throw the dice in such a way, that you shall not lose with your Lord and Master.
Do those deeds which shall bring you profit. ||21||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
If a servant performs service, while being vain and argumentative,
he may talk as much as he wants, but he shall not be pleasing to his Master.
But if he eliminates his self-conceit and then performs service, he shall be honored.
O Nanak, if he merges with the one with whom he is attached, his attachment becomes acceptable. ||1||
Second Mehl:
Whatever is in the mind, comes forth; spoken words by themselves are just wind.
He sows seeds of poison, and demands Ambrosial Nectar. Behold - what justice is this? ||2||
Second Mehl:
Friendship with a fool never works out right.
As he knows, he acts; behold, and see that it is so.
One thing can be absorbed into another thing, but duality keeps them apart.
No one can issue commands to the Lord Master; offer instead humble prayers.
Practicing falsehood, only falsehood is obtained. O Nanak, through the Lord's Praise, one blossoms forth. ||3||
Second Mehl:
Friendship with a fool, and love with a pompous person,
are like lines drawn in water, leaving no trace or mark. ||4||
Second Mehl:
If a fool does a job, he cannot do it right.
Even if he does something right, he does the next thing wrong. ||5||
Pauree:
If a servant, performing service, obeys the Will of his Master,
his honor increases, and he receives double his wages.
But if he claims to be equal to his Master, he earns his Master's displeasure.
He loses his entire salary, and is also beaten on his face with shoes.
Let us all celebrate Him, from whom we receive our nourishment.
O Nanak, no one can issue commands to the Lord Master; let us offer prayers instead. ||22||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
What sort of gift is this, which we receive only by our own asking?

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 129

O Nanak, that is the most wonderful gift, which is received from the Lord, when He is totally pleased. ||1||
Second Mehl:
What sort of service is this, by which the fear of the Lord Master does not depart?
O Nanak, he alone is called a servant, who merges with the Lord Master. ||2||
Pauree:
O Nanak, the Lord's limits cannot be known; He has no end or limitation.
He Himself creates, and then He Himself destroys.
Some have chains around their necks, while some ride on many horses.
He Himself acts, and He Himself causes us to act. Unto whom should I complain?
O Nanak, the One who created the creation - He Himself takes care of it. ||23||
Shalok, First Mehl:
He Himself fashioned the vessel of the body, and He Himself fills it.
Into some, milk is poured, while others remain on the fire.
Some lie down and sleep on soft beds, while others remain watchful.
He adorns those, O Nanak, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace. ||1||
Second Mehl:
He Himself creates and fashions the world, and He Himself keeps it in order.
Having created the beings within it, He oversees their birth and death.
Unto whom should we speak, O Nanak, when He Himself is all-in-all? ||2||
Pauree:
The description of the greatness of the Great Lord cannot be described.
He is the Creator, all-lowerful and benevolent; He gives sustenance to all beings.
The mortal does that work, which has been pre-destined from the very beginning.
O Nanak, except for the One Lord, there is no other place at all.
He does whatever He wills. ||24||1||
Sudh||One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Raag Aasaa, The Word Of The Devotees:
Kabeer, Naam Dayv And Ravi Daas.
Aasaa, Kabeer Jee:
Falling at the Feet of the Guru, I pray, and ask Him, "Why was man created?
What deeds cause the world to come into being, and be destroyed? Tell me, that I may understand."||1||
O Divine Guru, please, show Mercy to me, and place me on the right path, by which the bonds of fear may be cut away.
The pains of birth and death come from past actions and karma; peace comes when the soul finds release from reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
The mortal does not break free from the bonds of the noose of Maya, and he does not seek the shelter of the profound, absolute Lord.
He does not realize the dignity of the self, and Nirvaanaa; because of this, his doubt does not depart. ||2||
The soul is not born, even though he thinks it is born; it is free from birth and death.
When the mortal gives up his ideas of birth and death, he remains constantly absorbed in the Lord's Love. ||3||
As the reflection of an object blends in the water when the pitcher is broken,
says Kabeer, just so virtue dispels doubt, and then the soul is absorbed in the profound, absolute Lord. ||4||1||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 130

Aasaa:
They wear loin cloths, three and a half yards long, and triple-wound sacred threads.
They have rosaries around their necks, and they carry glittering jugs in their hands.
They are not called Saints of the Lord - they are thugs of Benares. ||1||
Such ‘saints’ are not pleasing to me;
they eat the trees along with the branches. ||1||Pause||
They wash their pots and pans before putting them on the stove, and they wash the wood before lighting it.
They dig up the earth and make two fireplaces, but they eat the whole person! ||2||
Those sinners continually wander in evil deeds, while they call themselves touch-nothing saints.
They wander around forever and ever in their self-conceit, and all their families are drowned. ||3||
He is attached to that, to which the Lord has attached him, and he acts accordingly.
Says Kabeer, one who meets the True Guru, is not reincarnated again. ||4||2||
Aasaa:
My Father has comforted me. He has given me a cozy bed, and placed His Ambrosial Nectar in my mouth.
How could I forget that Father from my mind?
When I go to the world hereafter, I shall not lose the game. ||1||
Maya is dead, O mother, and I am very happy.
I do not wear the patched coat, nor do I feel the chill. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice to my Father, who gave me life.
He put an end to my association with the five deadly sins.
I have conquered those five demons, and trampled them underfoot.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, my mind and body are drenched with His Love. ||2||
My Father is the Great Lord of the Universe.
How shall I go to that Father?
When I met the True Guru, He showed me the Way.
The Father of the Universe is pleasing to my mind. ||3||
I am Your son, and You are my Father.
We both dwell in the same place.
Says Kabeer, the Lord's humble servant knows only the One.
By Guru's Grace, I have come to know everything. ||4||3||
Aasaa:
In one pot, they put a boiled chicken, and in the other pot, they put wine.
The five Yogis of the Tantric ritual sit there, and in their midst sits the noseless one, the shameless queen. ||1||
The bell of the shameless queen, Maya, rings in both worlds.
Some rare person of discriminating wisdom has cut off your nose. ||1||Pause||
Within all dwells the noseless Maya, who kills all, and destroys them.
She says, “I am the sister, and the daughter of the sister of everyone; I am the hand-maiden of one who marries me.”||2||
My Husband is the Great One of discriminating wisdom; He alone is called a Saint.
He stands by me, and no one else comes near me. ||3||
I have cut off her nose, and cut off her ears, and cutting her into bits, I have expelled her.
Says Kabeer, she is the darling of the three worlds, but the enemy of the Saints. ||4||4||
Aasaa:
The Yogis, celibates, penitents and Sannyaasees make pilgrimages to all the sacred places.
The Jains with shaven heads, the silent ones, the beggars with matted hair - in the end, they all shall die. ||1||
Meditate, therefore, on the Lord.
What can the Messenger of Death do to one whose tongue loves the Name of the Lord? ||1||Pause||
Those who know the Shaastras and the Vedas, astrology and the rules of grammar of many languages;

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 131

those who know Tantras and mantras and all medicines - even they shall die in the end. ||2||
Those who enjoy regal power and rule, royal canopies and thrones, many beautiful women,
betel nuts, camphor and fragrant sandalwood oil - in the end, they too shall die. ||3||
I have searched all the Vedas, Puraanas and Simritees, but none of these can save anyone.
Says Kabeer, meditate on the Lord, and eliminate birth and death. ||4||5||
Aasaa:
The elephant is the guitar player, the ox is the drummer, and the crow plays the cymbals.
Putting on the skirt, the donkey dances around, and the water buffalo performs devotional worship. ||1||
The Lord, the King, has cooked the cakes of ice,
but only the rare man of understanding eats them. ||1||Pause||
Sitting in his den, the lion prepares the betel leaves, and the muskrat brings the betel nuts.
Going from house to house, the mouse sings the songs of joy, and the turtle blows on the conch-shell. ||2||
The son of the sterile woman goes to get married, and the golden canopy is spread out for him.
He marries a beautiful and enticing young woman; the rabbit and the lion sing their praises. ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - the ant has eaten the mountain.
The turtle says, “I need a burning coal, also.” Listen to this mystery of the Shabad. ||4||6||
Aasaa:
The body is a bag with seventy-two chambers, and one opening, the Tenth Gate.
He alone is a real Yogi on this earth, who asks for the primal world of the nine regions. ||1||
Such a Yogi obtains the nine treasures.
He lifts his soul up from below, to the skies of the Tenth Gate. ||1||Pause||
He makes spiritual wisdom his patched coat, and meditation his needle. He twists the thread of the Word of the Shabad.
Making the five elements his deer skin to sit on, he walks on the Guru's Path. ||2||
He makes compassion his shovel, his body the firewood, and he kindles the fire of divine vision.
He places love within his heart, and he remains in deep meditation throughout the four ages. ||3||
All Yoga is in the Name of the Lord; the body and the breath of life belong to Him.
Says Kabeer, if God grants His Grace, He bestows the insignia of Truth. ||4||7||
Aasaa:
Where have the Hindus and Muslims come from? Who put them on their different paths?
Think of this, and contemplate it within your mind, O men of evil intentions. Who will go to heaven and hell? ||1||
O Qazi, which book have you read?
Such scholars and students have all died, and none of them have discovered the inner meaning. ||1||Pause||
Because of the love of woman, circumcision is done; I don't believe in it, O Siblings of Destiny.
If God wished me to be a Muslim, it would be cut off by itself. ||2||
If circumcision makes one a Muslim, then what about a woman?
She is the other half of a man's body, and she does not leave him, so he remains a Hindu. ||3||
Give up your holy books, and remember the Lord, you fool, and stop oppressing others so badly.
Kabeer has grasped hold of the Lord's Support, and the Muslims have utterly failed. ||4||8||
Aasaa:
As long as the oil and the wick are in the lamp, everything is illuminated.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 132

But when the oil is burnt, the wick goes out, and the mansion becomes desolate. ||1||
O mad-man, no one will keep you, for even a moment.
Meditate on the Name of that Lord. ||1||Pause||
Tell me, whose mother is that, whose father is that, and which man has a wife?
When the pitcher of the body breaks, no one cares for you at all. Everyone says, “Take him away, take him away!”||2||
Sitting on the threshold, his mother cries, and his brothers take away the coffin.
Taking down her hair, his wife cries out in sorrow, and the swan-soul departs all alone. ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints, about the terrifying world-ocean.
This human suffers torture and the Messenger of Death will not leave him alone, O Lord of the World. ||4||9||
Du-Tukas
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa Of Kabeer Jee, Chau-Padas, Ik-Tukas:
Sanak and Sanand, the sons of Brahma, could not find the Lord's limits.
Brahma wasted his life away, continually reading the Vedas. ||1||
Churn the churn of the Lord, O my Siblings of Destiny.
Churn it steadily, so that the essence, the butter, may not be lost. ||1||Pause||
Make your body the churning jar, and use the stick of your mind to churn it.
Gather the curds of the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
The churning of the Lord is to reflect upon Him within your mind.
By Guru's Grace, the Ambrosial Nectar flows into us. ||3||
Says Kabeer, if the Lord, our King casts His Glance of Grace,
one is carried across to the other side, holding fast to the Lord's Name. ||4||1||10||
Aasaa:
The wick has dried up, and the oil is exhausted.
The drum does not sound, and the actor has gone to sleep. ||1||
The fire has gone out, and no smoke is produced.
The One Lord is pervading and permeating everywhere; there is no other second. ||1||Pause||
The string has broken, and the guitar makes no sound.
He mistakenly ruins his own affairs. ||2||
When one comes to understand, he forgets his preaching, ranting and raving, and arguing. ||3||
Says Kabeer, the state of supreme dignity is never far from those who conquer the five demons of the body passions. ||4||2||11||
Aasaa:
As many mistakes as the son commits,
his mother does not hold them against him in her mind. ||1||
O Lord, I am Your child.
Why not destroy my sins? ||1||Pause||
If the son, in anger, runs away,
even then, his mother does not hold it against him in her mind. ||2||
My mind has fallen into the whirlpool of anxiety.
Without the Naam, how can I cross over to the other side? ||3||
Please, bless my body with pure and lasting understanding, Lord;
in peace and poise, Kabeer chants the Praises of the Lord. ||4||3||12||
Aasaa:
My pilgrimage to Mecca is on the banks of the Gomati River;
the spiritual teacher in his yellow robes dwells there. ||1||
Waaho! Waaho! Hail! Hail! How wondrously he sings.
The Name of the Lord is pleasing to my mind. ||1||Pause||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 133

Naarada the sage, and Shaarada the goddess of knowledge, serve the Lord.
The goddess Lakhshmi sits by Him as His slave. ||2||
The mala is around my neck, and the Lord's Name is upon my tongue.
I repeat the Naam, the Name of the Lord, a thousand times, and bow in reverence to Him. ||3||
Says Kabeer, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord;
I teach both Hindus and Muslims. ||4||4||13||
Aasaa, Kabeer Jee, 9 Panch-Padas, 5 Du-Tukas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You tear off the leaves, O gardener, but in each and every leaf, there is life.
That stone idol, for which you tear off those leaves - that stone idol is lifeless. ||1||
In this, you are mistaken, O gardener.
The True Guru is the Living Lord. ||1||Pause||
Brahma is in the leaves, Vishnu is in the branches, and Shiva is in the flowers.
When you break these three gods, whose service are you performing? ||2||
The sculptor carves the stone and fashions it into an idol, placing his feet upon its chest.
If this stone god was true, it would devour the sculptor for this! ||3||
Rice and beans, candies, cakes and cookies
\- the priest enjoys these, while he puts ashes into the mouth of the idol. ||4||
The gardener is mistaken, and the world is mistaken, but I am not mistaken.
Says Kabeer, the Lord preserves me; the Lord, my King, has showered His Blessings upon me. ||5||1||14||
Aasaa:
Twelve years pass in childhood, and for another twenty years, he does not practice self-discipline and austerity.
For another thirty years, he does not worship God in any way, and then, when he is old, he repents and regrets. ||1||
His life wastes away as he cries out, “Mine, mine!”
The pool of his power has dried up. ||1||Pause||
He makes a dam around the dried-up pool, and with his hands, he makes a fence around the harvested field.
When the thief of Death comes, he quickly carries away what the fool had tried to preserve as his own. ||2||
His feet and head and hands begin to tremble, and the tears flow copiously from his eyes.
His tongue has not spoken the correct words, but now, he hopes to practice religion! ||3||
If the Dear Lord shows His Mercy, one enshrines love for Him, and obtains the Profit of the Lord's Name.
By Guru's Grace, he receives the wealth of the Lord's Name, which alone shall go with him, when he departs in the end. ||4||
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - he shall not take any other wealth with him.
When the summons comes from the King, the Lord of the Universe, the mortal departs, leaving behind his wealth and mansions. ||5||2||15||
Aasaa:
To some, the Lord has given silks and satins, and to some, beds decorated with cotton ribbons.
Some do not even have a poor patched coat, and some live in thatched huts. ||1||
Do not indulge in envy and bickering, O my mind.
By continually doing good deeds, these are obtained, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
The potter works the same clay, and colors the pots in different ways.
Into some, he sets pearls, while to others, he attaches filth. ||2||
God gave wealth to the miser for him to preserve, but the fool calls it his own.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 134

When the Messenger of Death strikes him with his club, in an instant, everything is settled. ||3||
The Lord's humble servant is called the most exalted Saint; he obeys the Command of the Lord's Order, and obtains peace.
Whatever is pleasing to the Lord, he accepts as True; he enshrines the Lord's Will within his mind. ||4||
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - it is false to call out, “Mine, mine.”
Breaking the bird cage, death takes the bird away, and only the torn threads remain. ||5||3||16||
Aasaa:
I am Your humble servant, Lord; Your Praises are pleasing to my mind.
The Lord, the Primal Being, the Master of the poor, does not ordain that they should be oppressed. ||1||
O Qazi, it is not right to speak before Him. ||1||Pause||
Keeping your fasts, reciting your prayers, and reading the Kalma, the Islamic creed, shall not take you to paradise.
The Temple of Mecca is hidden within your mind, if you only knew it. ||2||
That should be your prayer, to administer justice. Let your Kalma be the knowledge of the unknowable Lord.
Spread your prayer mat by conquering your five desires, and you shall recognize the true religion. ||3||
Recognize Your Lord and Master, and fear Him within your heart; conquer your egotism, and make it worthless.
As you see yourself, see others as well; only then will you become a partner in heaven. ||4||
The clay is one, but it has taken many forms; I recognize the One Lord within them all.
Says Kabeer, I have abandoned paradise, and reconciled my mind to hell. ||5||4||17||
Aasaa:
From the city of the Tenth Gate, the sky of the mind, not even a drop rains down. Where is the music of the sound current of the Naad, which was contained in it?
The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, the Master of wealth has taken away the Supreme Soul. ||1||
O Father, tell me: where has it gone? It used to dwell within the body,
and dance in the mind, teaching and speaking. ||1||Pause||
Where has the player gone - he who made this temple his own?
No story, word or understanding is produced; the Lord has drained off all the power. ||2||
The ears, your companions, have gone deaf, and the power of your organs is exhausted.
Your feet have failed, your hands have gone limp, and no words issue forth from your mouth. ||3||
Having grown weary, the five enemies and all the thieves have wandered away according to their own will.
The elephant of the mind has grown weary, and the heart has grown weary as well; through its power, it used to pull the strings. ||4||
He is dead, and the bonds of the ten gates are opened; he has left all his friends and brothers.
Says Kabeer, one who meditates on the Lord, breaks his bonds, even while yet alive. ||5||5||18||
Aasaa, 4 Ik-Tukas:
No one is more powerful than the she-serpent Maya,
who deceived even Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. ||1||
Having bitten and struck them down, she now sits in the immaculate waters.
By Guru's Grace, I have seen her, who has bitten the three worlds. ||1||Pause||
O Siblings of Destiny, why is she called a she-serpent?
One who realizes the True Lord, devours the she-serpent. ||2||
No one else is more frivolous than this she-serpent.
When the she-serpent is overcome, what can the Messengers of the King of Death do? ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 135

This she-serpent is created by Him.
What power or weakness does she have by herself? ||4||
If she abides with the mortal, then his soul abides in his body.
By Guru's Grace, Kabeer has easily crossed over. ||5||6||19||
Aasaa:
Why bother to read the Simritees to a dog?
Why bother to sing the Lord's Praises to the faithless cynic? ||1||
Remain absorbed in the Lord's Name, Raam, Raam, Raam.
Do not bother to speak of it to the faithless cynic, even by mistake. ||1||Pause||
Why offer camphor to a crow?
Why give the snake milk to drink? ||2||
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, discriminating understanding is attained.
That iron which touches the Philosopher's Stone becomes gold. ||3||
The dog, the faithless cynic, does everything as the Lord causes him to do.
He does the deeds pre-ordained from the very beginning. ||4||
If you take Ambrosial Nectar and irrigate the neem tree with it,
still, says Kabeer, its natural qualities are not changed. ||5||7||20||
Aasaa:
A fortress like that of Sri Lanka, with the ocean as a moat around it
\- there is no news about that house of Raavan. ||1||
What shall I ask for? Nothing is permanent.
I see with my eyes that the world is passing away. ||1||Pause||
Thousands of sons and thousands of grandsons
\- but in that house of Raavan, the lamps and wicks have gone out. ||2||
The moon and the sun cooked his food.
The fire washed his clothes. ||3||
Under Guru's Instructions, one whose mind is filled with the Lord's Name,
becomes permanent, and does not go anywhere. ||4||
Says Kabeer, listen, people:
without the Lord's Name, no one is liberated. ||5||8||21||
Aasaa:
First, the son was born, and then, his mother.
The guru falls at the feet of the disciple. ||1||
Listen to this wonderful thing, O Siblings of Destiny!
I saw the lion herding the cows. ||1||Pause||
The fish of the water gives birth upon a tree.
I saw a cat carrying away a dog. ||2||
The branches are below, and the roots are above.
The trunk of that tree bears fruits and flowers. ||3||
Riding a horse, the buffalo takes him out to graze.
The bull is away, while his load has come home. ||4||
Says Kabeer, one who understands this hymn,
and chants the Lord's Name, comes to understand everything. ||5||9||22||
22 Chau-Padas And Panch-Padas, Aasaa Of Kabeer Jee, 8 Tri-Padas, 7 Du-Tukas, 1 Ik-Tuka:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Lord created the body from sperm, and protected it in the fire pit.
For ten months He preserved you in your mother's womb, and then, after you were born, you became attached to Maya. ||1||
O mortal, why have you attached yourself to greed, and lost the jewel of life?
You did not plant the seeds of good actions in the earth of your past lives. ||1||Pause||
From an infant, you have grown old. That which was to happen, has happened.
When the Messenger of Death comes and grabs you by your hair, why do you cry out then? ||2||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 136

You hope for long life, while Death counts your breaths.
The world is a game, O Kabeer, so throw the dice consciously. ||3||1||23||
Aasaa:
I make my body the dying vat, and within it, I dye my mind. I make the five elements my marriage guests.
I take my marriage vows with the Lord, my King; my soul is imbued with His Love. ||1||
Sing, sing, O brides of the Lord, the marriage songs of the Lord.
The Lord, my King, has come to my house as my Husband. ||1||Pause||
Within the lotus of my heart, I have made my bridal pavilion, and I have spoken the wisdom of God.
I have obtained the Lord King as my Husband - such is my great good fortune. ||2||
The angles, holy men, silent sages, and the 330,000,000 deities have come in their heavenly chariots to see this spectacle.
Says Kabeer, I have been taken in marriage by the One Supreme Being, the Lord God. ||3||2||24||
Aasaa:
I am bothered by my mother-in-law, Maya, and loved by my father-in-law, the Lord. I fear even the name of my husband's elder brother, Death.
O my mates and companions, my husband's sister, misunderstanding has seized me, and I am burning with the pain of separation from my husband's younger brother, divine knowledge. ||1||
My mind has gone insane, since I forgot the Lord. How can I lead a virtuous lifestyle?
He rests in the bed of my mind, but I cannot see Him with my eyes. Unto whom should I tell my sufferings? ||1||Pause||
My step-father, egotism, fights with me, and my mother, desire, is always intoxicated.
When I stayed with my elder brother, meditation, then I was loved by my Husband Lord. ||2||
Says Kabeer, the five passions argue with me, and in these arguments, my life is wasting away.
The false Maya has bound the whole world, but I have obtained peace, chanting the Name of the Lord. ||3||3||25||
Aasaa:
In my house, I constantly weave the thread, while you wear the thread around your neck, O Brahmin.
You read the Vedas and sacred hymns, while I have enshrined the Lord of the Universe in my heart. ||1||
Upon my tongue, within my eyes, and within my heart, abides the Lord, the Lord of the Universe.
When you are interrogated at Death's door, O mad-man, what will you say then? ||1||Pause||
I am a cow, and You are the herdsman, the Sustainer of the World. You are my Saving Grace, lifetime after lifetime.
You have never taken me across to graze there - what sort of a herdsman are You? ||2||
You are a Brahmin, and I am a weaver of Benares; can You understand my wisdom?
You beg from emperors and kings, while I meditate on the Lord. ||3||4||26||
Aasaa:
The life of the world is only a dream; life is just a dream.
Believing it to be true, I grasped at it, and abandoned the supreme treasure. ||1||
O Father, I have enshrined love and affection for Maya,
which has taken the jewel of spiritual wisdom away from me. ||1||Pause||
The moth sees with its eyes, but it still becomes entangled; the insect does not see the fire.
Attached to gold and woman, the fool does not think of the noose of Death. ||2||
Reflect upon this, and abandon sin; the Lord is a boat to carry you across.
Says Kabeer, such is the Lord, the Life of the World; there is no one equal to Him. ||3||5||27||
Aasaa:

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 137

In the past, I have taken many forms, but I shall not take form again.
The strings and wires of the musical instrument are worn out, and I am in the power of the Lord's Name. ||1||
Now, I no longer dance to the tune.
My mind no longer beats the drum. ||1||Pause||
I have burnt away sexual desire, anger and attachment to Maya, and the pitcher of my desires has burst.
The gown of sensuous pleasures is worn out, and all my doubts have been dispelled. ||2||
I look upon all beings alike, and my conflict and strife are ended.
Says Kabeer, when the Lord showed His Favor, I obtained Him, the Perfect One. ||3||6||28||
Aasaa:
You keep your fasts to please Allah, while you murder other beings for pleasure.
You look after your own interests, and so not see the interests of others. What good is your word? ||1||
O Qazi, the One Lord is within you, but you do not behold Him by thought or contemplation.
You do not care for others, you are a religious fanatic, and your life is of no account at all. ||1||Pause||
Your holy scriptures say that Allah is True, and that he is neither male nor female.
But you gain nothing by reading and studying, O mad-man, if you do not gain the understanding in your heart. ||2||
Allah is hidden in every heart; reflect upon this in your mind.
The One Lord is within both Hindu and Muslim; Kabeer proclaims this out loud. ||3||7||29||
Aasaa, Ti-Pada, Ik-Tuka:
I have decorated myself to meet my Husband Lord.
But the Lord, the Life of the Word, the Sustainer of the Universe, has not come to meet me. ||1||
The Lord is my Husband, and I am the Lord's bride.
The Lord is so great, and I am infinitesimally small. ||1||Pause||
The bride and the Groom dwell together.
They lie upon the one bed, but their union is difficult. ||2||
Blessed is the soul-bride, who is pleasing to her Husband Lord.
Says Kabeer, she shall not have to be reincarnated again. ||3||8||30||
Aasaa Of Kabeer Jee, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When the Diamond of the Lord pierces the diamond of my mind, the fickle mind waving in the wind is easily absorbed into Him.
This Diamond fills all with Divine Light; through the True Guru's Teachings, I have found Him. ||1||
The sermon of the Lord is the unstruck, endless song.
Becoming a swan, one recognizes the Diamond of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, I have seen such a Diamond, permeating and pervading the world.
The hidden diamond became visible, when the Guru revealed it to me. ||2||1||31||
Aasaa:
My first wife, ignorance, was ugly, of low social status and bad character; she was evil in my home, and in her parents' home.
My present bride, divine understanding, is beautiful, wise and well-behaved; I have taken her to my heart. ||1||
It has turned out so well, that my first wife has died.
May she, whom I have now married, live throughout the ages. ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, when the younger bride came, the elder one lost her husband.
The younger bride is with me now, and the elder one has taken another husband. ||2||2||32||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 138

Aasaa:
My daughter-in-law was first called Dhannia, the woman of wealth,
but now she is called Raam-jannia, the servant of the Lord. ||1||
These shaven-headed saints have ruined my house.
They have caused my son to start chanting the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, listen, O mother:
these shaven-headed saints have done away with my low social status. ||2||3||33||
Aasaa:
Stay, stay, O daughter-in-law - do not cover your face with a veil.
In the end, this shall not bring you even half a shell. ||1||Pause||
The one before you used to veil her face;
do not follow in her footsteps. ||1||
The only merit in veiling your face is
that for a few days, people will say, “What a noble bride has come”. ||2||
Your veil shall be true only if
you skip, dance and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
Says Kabeer, the soul-bride shall win,
only if she passes her life singing the Lord's Praises. ||4||1||34||
Aasaa:
I would rather be cut apart by a saw, than have You turn Your back on me.
Hug me close, and listen to my prayer. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to You - please, turn Your face to me, O Beloved Lord.
Why have You turned Your back to me? Why have You killed me? ||1||Pause||
Even if You cut my body apart, I shall not pull my limbs away from You.
Even if my body falls, I shall not break my bonds of love with You. ||2||
Between You and I, there is no other.
You are the Husband Lord, and I am the soul-bride. ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O people:
now, I place no reliance in you. ||4||2||35||
Aasaa:
No one knows the secret of God, the Cosmic Weaver.
He has stretched out the fabric of the whole world. ||1||Pause||
When you listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas,
you shall know that the whole world is only a small piece of His woven fabric. ||1||
He has made the earth and sky His loom.
Upon it, He moves the two bobbins of the sun and the moon. ||2||
Placing my feet together, I have accomplished one thing - my mind is pleased with that Weaver.
I have come to understand my own home, and recognize the Lord within my heart. ||3||
Says Kabeer, when my body workshop breaks,
the Weaver shall blend my thread with His thread. ||4||3||36||
Aasaa:
With filth within the heart, even if one bathes at sacred places of pilgrimage, still, he shall not go to heaven.
Nothing is gained by trying to please others - the Lord cannot be fooled. ||1||
Worship the One Divine Lord.
The true cleansing bath is service to the Guru. ||1||Pause||
If salvation can be obtained by bathing in water, then what about the frog, which is always bathing in water?
As is the frog, so is that mortal; he is reincarnated, over and over again. ||2||
If the hard-hearted sinner dies in Benaares, he cannot escape hell.
And even if the Lord's Saint dies in the cursed land of Haramba, still, he saves all his family. ||3||
Where there is neither day nor night, and neither Vedas nor Shaastras, there, the Formless Lord abides.
Says Kabeer, meditate on Him, O mad-men of the world. ||4||4||37||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 139

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, The Word Of The Reverend Naam Dayv Jee:
In the one and in the many, He is pervading and permeating; wherever I look, there He is.
The marvellous image of Maya is so fascinating; how few understand this. ||1||
God is everything, God is everything. Without God, there is nothing at all.
As one thread holds hundreds and thousands of beads, He is woven into His creation. ||1||Pause||
The waves of the water, the foam and bubbles, are not distinct from the water.
This manifested world is the playful game of the Supreme Lord God; reflecting upon it, we find that it is not different from Him. ||2||
False doubts and dream objects - man believes them to be true.
The Guru has instructed me to try to do good deeds, and my awakened mind has accepted this. ||3||
Says Naam Dayv, see the Creation of the Lord, and reflect upon it in your heart.
In each and every heart, and deep within the very nucleus of all, is the One Lord. ||4||1||
Aasaa:
Bringing the pitcher, I fill it with water, to bathe the Lord.
But 4.2 million species of beings are in the water - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||1||
Wherever I go, the Lord is there.
He continually plays in supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||
I bring flowers to weave a garland, in worshipful adoration of the Lord.
But the bumble bee has already sucked out the fragrance - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||2||
I carry milk and cook it to make pudding, with which to feed the Lord.
But the calf has already tasted the milk - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||3||
The Lord is here, the Lord is there; without the Lord, there is no world at all.
Prays Naam Dayv, O Lord, You are totally permeating and pervading all places and interspaces. ||4||2||
Aasaa:
My mind is the yardstick, and my tongue is the scissors.
I measure it out and cut off the noose of death. ||1||
What do I have to do with social status? What do I have to with ancestry?
I meditate on the Name of the Lord, day and night. ||1||Pause||
I dye myself in the color of the Lord, and sew what has to be sewn.
Without the Lord's Name, I cannot live, even for a moment. ||2||
I perform devotional worship, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on my Lord and Master. ||3||
My needle is gold, and my thread is silver.
Naam Dayv's mind is attached to the Lord. ||4||3||
Aasaa:
The snake sheds its skin, but does not lose its venom.
The heron appears to be meditating, but it is concentrating on the water. ||1||
Why do you practice meditation and chanting,
when your mind is not pure? ||1||Pause||
That man who feeds like a lion,
is called the god of thieves. ||2||
Naam Dayv's Lord and Master has settled my inner conflicts.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 140

Drink in the sublime elixir of the Lord, O deceitful one. ||3||4||
Aasaa:
One who recognizes the Supreme Lord God, dislikes other desires.
He focuses his consciousness on the Lord's devotional worship, and keeps his mind free of anxiety. ||1||
O my mind, how will you cross over the world-ocean, if you are filled with the water of corruption?
Gazing upon the falseness of Maya, you have gone astray, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
You have given me birth in the house of a calico-printer, but I have found the Teachings of the Guru.
By the Grace of the Saint, Naam Dayv has met the Lord. ||2||5||
Aasaa, The Word Of The Reverend Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The deer, the fish, the bumble bee, the moth and the elephant are destroyed, each for a single defect.
So the one who is filled with the five incurable vices - what hope is there for him? ||1||
O Lord, he is in love with ignorance.
His lamp of clear wisdom has grown dim. ||1||Pause||
The creeping creatures live thoughtless lives, and cannot discriminate between good and evil.
It is so difficult to obtain this human incarnation, and yet, they keep company with the low. ||2||
Wherever the beings and creatures are, they are born according to the karma of their past actions.
The noose of death is unforgiving, and it shall catch them; it cannot be warded off. ||3||
O servant Ravi Daas, dispel your sorrow and doubt, and know that Guru-given spiritual wisdom is the penance of penances.
O Lord, Destroyer of the fears of Your humble devotees, make me supremely blissful in the end. ||4||1||
Aasaa:
Your Saints are Your body, and their company is Your breath of life.
By the True Guru-given spiritual wisdom, I know the Saints as the gods of gods. ||1||
O Lord, God of gods, grant me the Society of the Saints, the sublime essence of the Saints' conversation, and the Love of the Saints. ||1||Pause||
The Character of the Saints, the lifestyle of the Saints, and the service of the servant of the Saints. ||2||
I ask for these, and for one thing more - devotional worship, which shall fulfill my desires.
Do not show me the wicked sinners. ||3||
Says Ravi Daas, he alone is wise, who knows this:
there is no difference between the Saints and the Infinite Lord. ||4||2||
Aasaa:
You are sandalwood, and I am the poor castor oil plant, dwelling close to you.
From a lowly tree, I have become exalted; Your fragrance, Your exquisite fragrance now permeates me. ||1||
O Lord, I seek the Sanctuary of the company of Your Saints;
I am worthless, and You are so benevolent. ||1||Pause||
You are the white and yellow threads of silk, and I am like a poor worm.
O Lord, I seek to live in the Company of the Saints, like the bee with its honey. ||2||
My social status is low, my ancestry is low, and my birth is low as well.
I have not performed the service of the Lord, the Lord, says Ravi Daas the cobbler. ||3||3||
Aasaa:
What would it matter, if my body were cut into pieces?
If I were to lose Your Love, Lord, then Your humble servant would be afraid. ||1||
Your lotus feet are the home of my mind.
Drinking in Your Nectar, I have obtained the wealth of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Prosperity, adversity, property and wealth are just Maya.

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 141

Your humble servant is not engrossed in them. ||2||
Your humble servant is tied by the rope of Your Love.
Says Ravi Daas, what benefit would I get by escaping from it? ||3||4||
Aasaa:
The Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Haray.
Meditating on the Lord, the humble are carried across to salvation. ||1||Pause||
Through the Lord's Name, Kabeer became famous and respected.
The accounts of his past incarnations were torn up. ||1||
Because of Naam Dayv's devotion, the Lord drank the milk he offered.
He shall not have to suffer the pains of reincarnation into the world again. ||2||
Servant Ravi Daas is imbued with the Lord's Love.
By Guru's Grace, he shall not have to go to hell. ||3||5||
How does the puppet of clay dance?
He looks and listens, hears and speaks, and runs around. ||1||Pause||
When he acquires something, he is inflated with ego.
But when his wealth is gone, then he cries and bewails. ||1||
In thought, word and deed, he is attached to the sweet and tangy flavors.
When he dies, no one knows where he has gone. ||2||
Says Ravi Daas, the world is just a dramatic play, O Siblings of Destiny.
I have enshrined love for the Lord, the star of the show. ||3||6||
Aasaa, The Word Of Devotee Dhanna Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I wandered through countless incarnations, but mind, body and wealth never remain stable.
Attached to, and stained by the poisons of sexual desire and greed, the mind has forgotten the jewel of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The poisonous fruit seems sweet to the demented mind, which does not know the difference between good and evil.
Turning away from virtue, his love for other things increases, and he weaves again the web of birth and death. ||1||
He does not know the way to the Lord, who dwells within his heart; burning in the trap, he is caught by the noose of death.
Gathering the poisonous fruits, he fills his mind with them, and he forgets God, the Supreme Being, from his mind. ||2||
The Guru has given the wealth of spiritual wisdom; practicing meditation, the mind becomes one with Him.
Embracing loving devotional worship for the Lord, I have come to know peace; satisfied and satiated, I have been liberated. ||3||
One who is filled with the Divine Light, recognizes the undeceivable Lord God.
Dhanna has obtained the Lord, the Sustainer of the World, as his wealth; meeting the humble Saints, he merges in the Lord. ||4||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Naam Dayv's mind was absorbed into God, Gobind, Gobind, Gobind.
The calico-printer, worth half a shell, became worth millions. ||1||Pause||
Abandoning weaving and stretching thread, Kabeer enshrined love for the Lord's lotus feet.
A weaver from a lowly family, he became an ocean of excellence. ||1||
Ravi Daas, who used to carry dead cows every day, renounced the world of Maya.
He became famous in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||2||
Sain, the barber, the village drudge, became famous in each and every house.
The Supreme Lord God dwelled in his heart, and he was counted among the devotees. ||3||

## Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 142

Hearing this, Dhanna the Jaat applied himself to devotional worship.
The Lord of the Universe met him personally; Dhanna was so very blessed. ||4||2||
O my consciousness, why don't you remain conscious of the Merciful Lord? How can you recognize any other?
You may run around the whole universe, but that alone happens which the Creator Lord does. ||1||Pause||
In the water of the mother's womb, He fashioned the body with ten gates.
He gives it sustenance, and preserves it in fire - such is my Lord and Master. ||1||
The mother turtle is in the water, and her babies are out of the water. She has no wings to protect them, and no milk to feed them.
The Perfect Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss, the Fascinating Lord takes care of them. See this, and understand it in your mind||2||
The worm lies hidden under the stone - there is no way for him to escape.
Says Dhanna, the Perfect Lord takes care of him. Fear not, O my soul. ||3||3||
Aasaa, The Word Of Shaykh Fareed Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
They alone are true, whose love for God is deep and heart-felt.
Those who have one thing in their heart, and something else in their mouth, are judged to be false. ||1||
Those who are imbued with love for the Lord, are delighted by His Vision.
Those who forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are a burden on the earth. ||1||Pause||
Those whom the Lord attaches to the hem of His robe, are the true dervishes at His Door.
Blessed are the mothers who gave birth to them, and fruitful is their coming into the world. ||2||
O Lord, Sustainer and Cherisher, You are infinite, unfathomable and endless.
Those who recognize the True Lord - I kiss their feet. ||3||
I seek Your Protection - You are the Forgiving Lord.
Please, bless Shaykh Fareed with the bounty of Your meditative worship. ||4||1||
Aasaa:
Says Shaykh Fareed, O my dear friend, attach yourself to the Lord.
This body shall turn to dust, and its home shall be a neglected graveyard. ||1||
You can meet the Lord today, O Shaykh Fareed, if you restrain your bird-like desires which keep your mind in turmoil. ||1||Pause||
If I had known that I was to die, and not return again,
I would not have ruined myself by clinging to the world of falsehood. ||2||
So speak the Truth, in righteousness, and do not speak falsehood.
The disciple ought to travel the route, pointed out by the Guru. ||3||
Seeing the youths being carried across, the hearts of the beautiful young soul-brides are encouraged.
Those who side with the glitter of gold, are cut down with a saw. ||4||
O Shaykh, no one's life is permanent in this world.
That seat, upon which we now sit - many others sat on it and have since departed. ||5||
As the swallows appear in the month of Katik, forest fires in the month of Chayt, and lightning in Saawan,
and as the bride's arms adorn her husband's neck in winter;||6||
Just so, the transitory human bodies pass away. Reflect upon this in your mind.
It takes six months to form the body, but it breaks in an instant. ||7||
O Fareed, the earth asks the sky, “Where have the boatmen gone?”
Some have been cremated, and some lie in their graves; their souls are suffering rebukes. ||8||2||
