## Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 001

One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl:
O Primal Lord God, You Yourself are the Creator, the Cause of all causes.
You are All-pervading everywhere, totally filling all hearts.
You are seen pervading the world; who can know Your State? You protect all; You are our Lord and Master.
O my Imperishable and Formless Lord, You formed Yourself.
You are the One and Only; no one else is like You.
O Lord, You have no end or limitation. Who can contemplate You? You are the Father of the world, the Support of all life.
Your devotees are at Your Door, O God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||1||
Streams of Ambrosial Nectar flow; Your Treasures are unweighable and overflowing in abundance. You are the Farthest of the far, Infinite and Incomparably Beautiful.
You do whatever You please; You do not take advice from anyone else. In Your Home, creation and destruction happen in an instant.
No one else is equal to You; Your Light is Immaculate and Pure. Millions of sins are washed away, chanting Your Name, Har, Har.
Your devotees are at Your Door, God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||2||
You established all the worlds from within Yourself, and extended them outward. You are All-pervading amongst all, and yet You Yourself remain detached.
O Lord, there is no end or limit to Your Glorious Virtues; all beings and creatures are Yours. You are the Giver of all, the One Invisible Lord.

## Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 002

He Himself supports the Universe, revealing His All-powerful Creative Potency. He has no color, form, mouth or beard.
Your devotees are at Your Door, O God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||3||
You are the Treasure of all virtue; who can know the value of Your spiritual wisdom and meditation? O God, Your Place is known as the highest of the high.
Mind, wealth and the breath of life belong to You alone, Lord. The world is strung upon Your Thread. What praises can I give to You? You are the Greatest of the great.
Who can know Your Mystery? O Unfathomable, Infinite, Divine Lord, Your Power is unstoppable. O God, You are the Support of all.
Your devotees are at Your Door, O God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||
O Formless, Formed, Undeceivable, Perfect, Imperishable,
Blissful, Unlimited, Beautiful, Immaculate, Blossoming Lord:
Countless are those who sing Your Glorious Praises, but they do not know even a tiny bit of Your extent.
That humble being upon whom You shower Your Mercy meets with You, O God.
Blessed, blessed, blessed are those humble beings, upon whom the Lord, Har, Har, showers His Mercy.
Whoever meets with the Lord through Guru Nanak is rid of both birth and death. ||5||
The Lord is said to be True, True, True, True, the Truest of the True.
There is no other like Him. He is the Primal Being, the Primal Soul.
Chanting the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, the mortal is blessed with all comforts.
Those who taste it with their tongues, those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled.
That person who becomes pleasing to his Lord and Master, loves the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
Whoever meets with the Lord through Guru Nanak, saves all his generations. ||6||
True is His Congregation and His Court. The True Lord has established Truth.
Sitting upon His Throne of Truth, He administers True Justice.
The True Lord Himself fashioned the Universe. He is Infallible, and does not make mistakes.
The Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord, is the jewel. Its value cannot be appraised - it is priceless.
That person, upon whom the Lord of the Universe showers His Mercy obtains all comforts.
Those who touch the Feet of the Lord through Guru Nanak, do not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation ever again. ||7||
What is the Yoga, what is the spiritual wisdom and meditation, and what is the way, to praise the Lord?
The Siddhas and seekers and the three hundred thirty million gods cannot find even a tiny bit of the Lord's Value.
Neither Brahma, nor Sanak, nor the thousand-headed serpent king can find the limits of His Glorious Virtues.
The Inapprehensible Lord cannot be apprehended. He is pervading and permeating amongst all.
Those whom God has mercifully freed from their nooses - those humble beings are attached to His devotional worship.
Those who meet with the Lord through Guru Nanak are liberated forever, here and hereafter. ||8||
I am a beggar; I seek the Sanctuary of God, the Giver of givers.
Please bless me with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints; grasping them, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
Please listen to my prayer, if it pleases You, O my Lord and Master.

## Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 003

My mind yearns for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. This mind abides in devotional worship.
The lamp is lit in the darkness; all are saved in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, through the One Name and faith in the Dharma.
The Lord is revealed in all the worlds. O servant Nanak, the Guru is the Supreme Lord God. ||9||
Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
This body is frail and transitory, and bound to emotional attachment. I am foolish, stone-hearted, filthy and unwise.
My mind wanders and wobbles, and will not hold steady. It does not know the state of the Supreme Lord God.
I am intoxicated with the wine of youth, beauty and the riches of Maya. I wander around perplexed, in excessive egotistical pride.
The wealth and women of others, arguments and slander, are sweet and dear to my soul.
I try to hide my deception, but God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of Hearts, sees and hears all.
I have no humility, faith, compassion or purity, but I seek Your Sanctuary, O Giver of life.
The All-powerful Lord is the Cause of causes. O Lord and Master of Nanak, please save me! ||1||
The Praises of the Creator, the Enticer of the mind, are potent to destroy sins.
The All-powerful Lord is the boat, to carry us across; He saves all our generations.
O my unconscious mind, contemplate and remember Him in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Why are you wandering around, enticed by the darkness of doubt?
Remember Him in meditation, for an hour, for a moment, even for an instant. Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue.
You are bound to worthless deeds and shallow pleasures; why do you spend millions of lifetimes wandering in such pain?
Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, through the Teachings of the Saints. Meditate on the Lord with love in your soul. ||2||
The little sperm is planted in the body-field of the mother, and the human body, so difficult to obtain, is formed.
He eats and drinks, and enjoys pleasures; his pains are taken away, and his suffering is gone.
He is given the understanding to recognize mother, father, siblings and relatives.
He grows day by day, as the horrible specter of old age comes closer and closer.
You worthless, petty worm of Maya - remember your Lord and Master, at least for an instant!
Please take Nanak's hand, O Merciful Ocean of Mercy, and take away this heavy load of doubt. ||3||
O mind, you are a mouse, living in the mousehole of the body; you are so proud of yourself, but you act like an absolute fool.
You swing in the swing of wealth, intoxicated with Maya, and you wander around like an owl.
You take pleasure in your children, spouse, friends and relatives; your emotional attachment to them is increasing.
You have planted the seeds of egotism, and the sprout of possessiveness has come up. You pass your life making sinful mistakes.
The cat of death, with his mouth wide-open, is watching you. You eat food, but you are still hungry.
Meditate in remembrance on the Merciful Lord of the World, O Nanak, in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Know that the world is just a dream. ||4||

## Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 004

Neither body, nor house, nor love last forever. You are intoxicated with Maya; how long will you be proud of them?
Neither crown, nor canopy, nor servants last forever. You do not consider in your heart that your life is passing away.
Neither chariots, nor horses, nor elephants or royal thrones shall last forever. In an instant, you will have to leave them, and depart naked.
Neither warrior, nor hero, nor king or ruler last forever; see this with your eyes.
Neither fortress, nor shelter, nor treasure will save you; doing evil deeds, you shall depart empty-handed.
Friends, children, spouses and friends - none of them last forever; they change like the shade of a tree.
God is the Perfect Primal Being, Merciful to the meek; each and every instant, meditate in remembrance on Him, the Inaccessible and Infinite.
O Great Lord and Master, servant Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; please shower him with Your Mercy, and carry him across. ||5||
I have used up my breath of life, sold my self-respect, begged for charity, committed highway robbery, and dedicated my consciousness to the love and pursuit of acquiring wealth.
I have kept it secretly hidden from my friends, relatives, companions, children and siblings.
I ran around practicing falsehood, burning up my body and growing old.
I gave up good deeds, righteousness and Dharma, self-discipline, purity, religious vows and all good ways; I associated with the fickle Maya.
Beasts and birds, trees and mountains - in so many ways, I wandered lost in reincarnation.
I did not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, for a moment, or even an instant. He is the Master of the meek, the Lord of all life.
The food and drink, and the sweet and tasty dishes became totally bitter at the last moment.
O Nanak, I was saved in the Society of the Saints, at their feet; the others, intoxicated with Maya, have gone, leaving everything behind. ||6||
Brahma, Shiva, the Vedas and the silent sages sing the Glorious Praises of their Lord and Master with love and delight.
Indra, Vishnu and Gorakh, who come to earth and then go to heaven again, seek the Lord.
The Siddhas, human beings, gods and demons cannot find even a tiny bit of His Mystery.
The Lord's humble servants are imbued with love and affection for God their Beloved; in the delight of devotional worship, they are absorbed in the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
But those who forsake Him, and beg from another, shall see their mouths, teeth and tongues wear away.
O my foolish mind, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, the Giver of peace. Slave Nanak imparts these teachings. ||7||
The pleasures of Maya shall fade away. In doubt, the mortal falls into the deep dark pit of emotional attachment.
He is so proud, even the sky cannot contain him. His belly is filled with manure, bones and worms.
He runs around in the ten directions, for the sake of the great poison of corruption. He steals the wealth of others, and in the end, he is destroyed by his own ignorance.
His youth passes away, the illnesses of old age seize him, and the Messenger of Death punishes him; such is the death he dies.
He suffers the agony of hell in countless incarnations; he rots away in the pit of pain and condemnation.
O Nanak, those whom the Saint mercifully takes as his own, are carried across by their loving devotional worship. ||8||
All virtues are obtained, all fruits and rewards, and the desires of the mind; my hopes have been totally fulfilled.
The Medicine, the Mantra, the Magic Charm, will cure all illnesses and totally take away all pain.

## Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 005

Lust, anger, egotism, jealousy and desire are eliminated by chanting the Name of the Lord.
The merits of cleansing baths, charity, penance, purity and good deeds, are obtained by enshrining the Lotus Feet of God within the heart.
The Lord is my Friend, my Very Best Friend, Companion and Relative. God is the Sustenance of the soul, the Support of the breath of life.
I have grasped the Shelter and Support of my All-powerful Lord and Master; slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||9||
Weapons cannot cut that person who delights in the love of the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Ropes cannot bind that person whose mind is pierced through by the Vision of the Lord's Way.
Fire cannot burn that person who is attached to the dust of the feet of the Lord's humble servant.
Water cannot drown that person whose feet walk on the Lord's Path.
O Nanak, diseases, faults, sinful mistakes and emotional attachment are pierced by the Arrow of the Name. ||1||10||
People are engaged in making all sorts of efforts; they contemplate the various aspects of the six Shaastras.
Rubbing ashes all over their bodies, they wander around at the various sacred shrines of pilgrimage; they fast until their bodies are emaciated, and braid their hair into tangled messes.
Without devotional worship of the Lord, they all suffer in pain, caught in the tangled web of their love.
They perform worship ceremonies, draw ritual marks on their bodies, cook their own food fanatically, and make pompous shows of themselves in all sorts of ways. ||2||11||20||

Blessed is the Primal Lord God, the Creator, the All-powerful Cause of causes.
Blessed is the True Guru Nanak, who placed His hand upon Your forehead.
When He placed His hand upon Your forehead, then the celestial nectar began to rain down in torrents; the gods and human beings, heavenly heralds and sages were drenched in its fragrance.

## Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 020

By Guru's Grace, the greatest thing is obtained, and the mind is involved with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
You have formed and created this play, this great game. O Waahay Guru, this is all Your making. ||3||13||42||
The Lord is Inaccessible, Infinite, Eternal and Primordial; no one knows His beginning.
Shiva and Brahma meditate on Him; the Vedas describe Him again and again.
The Lord is Formless, beyond hate and vengeance; there is no one else like Him.
He creates and destroys - He is All-powerful; God is the Boat to carry all across.
He created the world in its various aspects; His humble servant MAT'HURAA delights in His Praises.
Sat Naam, the Great and Supreme True Name of God, the Personification of Creativity, dwells in the Consciousness of Guru Raam Daas. ||1||
I have grasped hold of the All-powerful Guru; He has made my mind steady and stable, and embellished me with clear consciousness.
And, His Banner of Righteousness waves proudly forever, to defend against the waves of sin.
His humble servant MAT'HRAA knows this as true, and speaks it from his soul; there is nothing else to consider.
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the Great Ship, to carry us all across the terrifying world-ocean, safely to the other side. ||2||

For His Sake, the silent sages meditated and focused their consciousness, wandering all the ages through; rarely, if ever, their souls were enlightened.
In the Hymns of the Vedas, Brahma sang His Praises; for His Sake, Shiva the silent sage held his place on the Kailaash Mountain.
For His Sake, the Yogis, celibates, Siddhas and seekers, the countless sects of fanatics with matted hair wear religious robes, wandering as detached renunciates.
That True Guru, by the Pleasure of His Will, showered His Mercy upon all beings, and blessed Guru Raam Daas with the Glorious Greatness of the Naam. ||5||
He focuses His Meditation deep within; the Embodiment of Light, He illuminates the three worlds.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, doubt runs away, pain is eradicated, and celestial peace spontaneously wells up.

Meditate on the True Guru, O men, through Whom the Lord is obtained. ||5||54||
Living the Word of the Shabad, He attained the supreme status; while performing selfless service, He did not leave the side of Guru Amar Daas.
From that service, the light from the jewel of spiritual wisdom shines forth, radiant and bright; it has destroyed pain, poverty and darkness.

## Section 42 - Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl - Part 022

So speaks KEERAT the poet: those who grasp hold of the feet of the Saints, are not afraid of death, sexual desire or anger.
Just as Guru Nanak was part and parcel, life and limb with Guru Angad, so is Guru Amar Daas one with Guru Raam Daas. ||1||
Whoever serves the True Guru obtains the treasure; night and day, he dwells at the Lord's Feet.

The Unspoken Speech of Guru Amar Daas cannot be expressed with only one tongue.
Guru Raam Daas of the Sodhi dynasty has now been blessed with Glorious Greatness, to carry the whole world across. ||3||
I am overflowing with sins and demerits; I have no merits or virtues at all. I abandoned the Ambrosial Nectar, and I drank poison instead.
I am attached to Maya, and deluded by doubt; I have fallen in love with my children and spouse.
I have heard that the most exalted Path of all is the Sangat, the Guru's Congregation. Joining it, the fear of death is taken away.
KEERAT the poet offers this one prayer: O Guru Raam Daas, save me! Take me into Your Sanctuary! ||4||58||
He has crushed and overpowered emotional attachment. He seized sexual desire by the hair, and threw it down.
With His Power, He cut anger into pieces, and sent greed away in disgrace.
Life and death, with palms pressed together, respect and obey the Hukam of His Command.
He brought the terrifying world-ocean under His Control; by His Pleasure, He carried His Sikhs across.
He is seated upon the Throne of Truth, with the canopy above His Head; He is embellished with the powers of Yoga and the enjoyment of pleasures.
So speaks SALL the poet: O Guru Raam Daas, Your sovereign power is eternal and unbreakable; Your army is invincible. ||1||
