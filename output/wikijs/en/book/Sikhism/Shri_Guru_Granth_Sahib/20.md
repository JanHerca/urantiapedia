## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 001

One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Raag Bilaaval, First Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
You are the Emperor, and I call You a chief - how does this add to Your greatness?
As You permit me, I praise You, O Lord and Master; I am ignorant, and I cannot chant Your Praises. ||1||
Please bless me with such understanding, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises.
May I dwell in Truth, according to Your Will. ||1||Pause||
Whatever has happened, has all come from You. You are All-knowing.
Your limits cannot be known, O my Lord and Master; I am blind - what wisdom do I have? ||2||
What should I say? While talking, I talk of seeing, but I cannot describe the indescribable.
As it pleases Your Will, I speak; it is just the tiniest bit of Your greatness. ||3||
Among so many dogs, I am an outcast; I bark for my body's belly.
Without devotional worship, O Nanak, even so, still, my Master's Name does not leave me. ||4||1||
Bilaawal, First Mehl:
My mind is the temple, and my body is the simple cloth of the humble seeker; deep within my heart, I bathe at the sacred shrine.
The One Word of the Shabad abides within my mind; I shall not come to be born again. ||1||
My mind is pierced through by the Merciful Lord, O my mother!
Who can know the pain of another?
I think of none other than the Lord. ||1||Pause||
O Lord, inaccessible, unfathomable, invisible and infinite: please, take care of me!
In the water, on the land and in sky, You are totally pervading. Your Light is in each and every heart. ||2||
All teachings, instructions and understandings are Yours; the mansions and sanctuaries are Yours as well.
Without You, I know no other, O my Lord and Master; I continually sing Your Glorious Praises. ||3||
All beings and creatures seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary; all thought of their care rests with You.
That which pleases Your Will is good; this alone is Nanak's prayer. ||4||2||
Bilaawal, First Mehl:
He Himself is the Word of the Shabad, and He Himself is the Insignia.
He Himself is the Listener, and He Himself is the Knower.
He Himself created the creation, and He Himself beholds His almighty power.
You are the Great Giver; Your Name alone is approved. ||1||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 002

Such is the Name of the Immaculate, Divine Lord.
I am just a beggar; You are invisible and unknowable. ||1||Pause||
Love of Maya is like a cursed woman, ugly, dirty and promiscuous.
Power and beauty are false, and last for only a few days.
But when one is blessed with the Naam, the darkness within is illuminated. ||2||
I tasted Maya and renounced it, and now, I have no doubts.
One whose father is known, cannot be illegitimate.
One who belongs to the One Lord, has no fear.
The Creator acts, and causes all to act. ||3||
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad conquers his mind, through his mind.
Keeping his mind restrained, he enshrines the True Lord within his heart.
He does not know any other, and he is a sacrifice to the Guru.
O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, he is emancipated. ||4||3||
Bilaaval, First Mehl:
Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, the mind intuitively meditates on the Lord.
Imbued with the Lord's Love, the mind is satisfied.
The insane, self-willed manmukhs wander around, deluded by doubt.
Without the Lord, how can anyone survive? Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized. ||1||
Without the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, how can I live, O my mother?
Without the Lord, my soul cannot survive, even for an instant; the True Guru has helped me understand this. ||1||Pause||
Forgetting my God, I die in pain.
With each breath and morsel of food, I meditate on my Lord, and seek Him.
I remain always detached, but I am enraptured with the Lord's Name.
Now, as Gurmukh, I know that the Lord is always with me. ||2||
The Unspoken Speech is spoken, by the Will of the Guru.
He shows us that God is unapproachable and unfathomable.
Without the Guru, what lifestyle could we practice, and what work could we do?
Eradicating egotism, and walking in harmony with the Guru's Will, I am absorbed in the Word of the Shabad. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs are separated from the Lord, gathering false wealth.
The Gurmukhs are celebrated with the glory of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Lord has showered His Mercy upon me, and made me the slave of His slaves.
The Name of the Lord is the wealth and capital of servant Nanak. ||4||4||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Cursed, cursed is the food; cursed, cursed is the sleep; cursed, cursed are the clothes worn on the body.
Cursed is the body, along with family and friends, when one does not find his Lord and Master in this life.
He misses the step of the ladder, and this opportunity will not come into his hands again; his life is wasted, uselessly. ||1||
The love of duality does not allow him to lovingly focus his attention on the Lord; he forgets the Feet of the Lord.
O Life of the World, O Great Giver, you eradicate the sorrows of your humble servants. ||1||Pause||
You are Merciful, O Great Giver of Mercy; what are these poor beings?
All are liberated or placed into bondage by You; this is all one can say.
One who becomes Gurmukh is said to be liberated, while the poor self-willed manmukhs are in bondage. ||2||
He alone is liberated, who lovingly focuses his attention on the One Lord, always dwelling with the Lord.
His depth and condition cannot be described. The True Lord Himself embellishes him.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 003

Those who wander around, deluded by doubt, are called manmukhs; they are neither on this side, nor on the other side. ||3||
That humble being, who is blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace obtains Him, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
In the midst of Maya, the Lord's servant is emancipated.
O Nanak, one who has such destiny inscribed upon his forehead, conquers and destroys death. ||4||1||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
How can the unweighable be weighed?
If there is anyone else as great, then he alone could understand the Lord.
There is no other than Him.
How can His value be estimated? ||1||
By Guru's Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind.
One comes to know Him, when duality departs. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the Assayer, applying the touch-stone to test it.
He Himself analyzes the coin, and He Himself approves it as currency.
He Himself weights it perfectly.
He alone knows; He is the One and Only Lord. ||2||
All the forms of Maya emanate from Him.
He alone becomes pure and immaculate, who is united with the Lord.
He alone is attached, whom the Lord attaches.
All Truth is revealed to him, and then, he merges in the True Lord. ||3||
He Himself leads the mortals to focus on Him, and He Himself causes them to chase after Maya.
He Himself imparts understanding, and He reveals Himself.
He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the Word of the Shabad.
O Nanak, He Himself speaks and teaches. ||4||2||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
My Lord and Master has made me His servant, and blessed me with His service; how can anyone argue about this?
Such is Your play, One and Only Lord; You are the One, contained among all. ||1||
When the True Guru is pleased and appeased, one is absorbed in the Lord's Name. One who is blessed by the Lord's Mercy, finds the True Guru; night and day, he automatically remains focused on the Lord's meditation. ||1||Pause||
How can I serve You? How can I be proud of this?
When You withdraw Your Light, O Lord and Master, then who can speak and teach? ||2||
You Yourself are the Guru, and You Yourself are the chaylaa, the humble disciple; You Yourself are the treasure of virtue.
As You cause us to move, so do we move, according to the Pleasure of Your Will, O Lord God. ||3||
Says Nanak, You are the True Lord and Master; who can know Your actions?
Some are blessed with glory in their own homes, while others wander in doubt and pride. ||4||3||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
The perfect Lord has fashioned the Perfect Creation. Behold the Lord pervading everywhere.
In this play of the world, is the glorious greatness of the True Name. No one should take pride in himself. ||1||
One who accepts the wisdom of the True Guru's Teachings, is absorbed into the True Guru.
The Lord's Name abides deep within the nucleus of one who realizes the Bani of the Guru's Word within his soul. ||1||Pause||
Now, this is the essence of the teachings of the four ages: for the human race, the Name of the One Lord is the greatest treasure.
Celibacy, self-discipline and pilgrimages were the essence of Dharma in those past ages; but in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Praise of the Lord's Name is the essence of Dharma. ||2||
Each and every age has its own essence of Dharma; study the Vedas and the Puraanas, and see this as true.
They are Gurmukh, who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; in this world, they are perfect and approved. ||3||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 004

Says Nanak, loving the True Lord, the mind's egotism and self-conceit is eradicated.
Those who speak and listen to the Lord's Name, all find peace. Those who believe in it, obtain the supreme treasure. ||4||4||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
The Lord Himself attaches the Gurmukh to His Love;
joyful melodies permeate his home, and he is embellished with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The women come and sing the songs of joy.
Meeting with their Beloved, lasting peace is obtained. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to those, whose minds are filled with the Lord.
Meeting with the humble servant of the Lord, peace is obtained, and one intuitively sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
They are always imbued with Your Joyful Love;
O Dear Lord, You Yourself come to dwell in their minds.
They obtain eternal glory.
The Gurmukhs are united in the Lord's Union. ||2||
The Gurmukhs are imbued with the love of the Word of the Shabad.
They abide in the home of their own being, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
They are dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love; they look so beautiful.
This dye never fades away; they are absorbed in the True Lord. ||3||
The Shabad deep within the nucleus of the self dispels the darkness of ignorance.
Meeting with my Friend, the True Guru, I have obtained spiritual wisdom.
Those who are attuned to the True Lord, do not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again.
O Nanak, my Perfect Guru implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, deep within. ||4||5||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
From the Perfect Guru, I have obtained glorious greatness.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, has spontaneously come to abide in my mind.
Through the Word of the Shabad, I have burnt away egotism and Maya.
Through the Guru, I have obtained honor in the Court of the True Lord. ||1||
I serve the Lord of the Universe; I have no other work to do.
Night and day, my mind is in ecstasy; as Gurmukh, I beg for the bliss-giving Naam. ||1||Pause||
From the mind itself, mental faith is obtained.
Through the Guru, I have realized the Shabad.
How rare is that person, who looks upon life and death alike.
She shall never die again, and shall not have to see the Messenger of Death. ||2||
Within the home of the self are all the millions of treasures.
The True Guru has revealed them, and my egotistical pride is gone.
I keep my meditation always focused on the Cosmic Lord.
Night and day, I sing the One Name. ||3||
I have obtained glorious greatness in this age,
from the Perfect Guru, meditating on the Naam.
Wherever I look, I see the Lord permeating and pervading.
He is forever the Giver of peace; His worth cannot be estimated. ||4||
By perfect destiny, I have found the Perfect Guru.
He has revealed to me the treasure of the Naam, deep within the nucleus of my self.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is so very sweet.
O Nanak, my thirst is quenched, and my mind and body have found peace. ||5||6||4||6||10||
Raag Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Effort and intelligence come from God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; as He wills, they act.
As the violinist plays upon the strings of the violin, so does the Lord play the living beings. ||1||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 005

Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue, O mind.
According to the pre-ordained destiny written upon my forehead, I have found the Guru, and the Lord abides within my heart. ||1||Pause||
Entangled in Maya, the mortal wanders around. Save Your humble servant, O Lord,
as you saved Prahlaad from the clutches of Harnaakash; keep him in Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||2||
How can I describe the state and the condition, O Lord, of those many sinners you have purified?
Ravi Daas, the leather-worker, who worked with hides and carried dead animals was saved, by entering the Lord's Sanctuary. ||3||
O God, Merciful to the meek, carry Your devotees across the world-ocean; I am a sinner - save me from sin!
O Lord, make me the slave of the slave of Your slaves; servant Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. ||4||1||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
I am foolish, idiotic and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary, O Primal Being, O Lord beyond birth.
Have Mercy upon me, and save me, O my Lord and Master; I am a lowly stone, with no good karma at all. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate and meditate on the Lord, the Name of the Lord.
Under Guru's Instructions, obtain the sublime, subtle essence of the Lord; renounce other fruitless actions. ||1||Pause||
The humble servants of the Lord are saved by the Lord; I am worthless - it is Your glory to save me.
I have no other than You, O my Lord and Master; I meditate on the Lord, by my good karma. ||2||
Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, their lives are cursed, and they must endure terrible pain.
They are consigned to reincarnation over and over again; they are the most unfortunate fools, with no good karma at all. ||3||
The Naam is the Support of the Lord's humble servants; their good karma is pre-ordained.
The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam within servant Nanak, and his life is fruitful. ||4||2||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
My consciousness is lured by emotional attachment and corruption; is is filled with evil-minded filth.
I cannot serve You, O God; I am ignorant - how can I cross over? ||1||
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord of man.
God has showered His Mercy upon His humble servant; meeting with the True Guru, he is carried across. ||1||Pause||
O my Father, my Lord and Master, Lord God, please bless me with such understanding, that I may sing Your Praises.
Those who are attached to You are saved, like iron which is carried across with wood. ||2||
The faithless cynics have little or no understanding; they do not serve the Lord, Har, Har.
Those beings are unfortunate and vicious; they die, and are consigned to reincarnation, over and over again. ||3||
Those whom You unite with Yourself, O Lord and Master, bathe in the Guru's cleansing pool of contentment.
Vibrating upon the Lord, the filth of their evil-mindedness is washed away; servant Nanak is carried across. ||4||3||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
Come, O Saints, and join together, O my Siblings of Destiny; let us tell the Stories of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the boat in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the boatman to ferry us across. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
According to the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon your forehead, sing the Praises of the Lord; join the Holy Congregation, and cross over the world-ocean. ||1||Pause||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 006

Within the body-village is the Lord's supreme, sublime essence. How can I obtain it? Teach me, O humble Saints.
Serving the True Guru, you shall obtain the Fruitful Vision of the Lord's Darshan; meeting Him, drink in the ambrosial essence of the Lord's Nectar. ||2||
The Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is so sweet; O Saints of the Lord, taste it, and see.
Under Guru's Instruction, the Lord's essence seems so sweet; through it, all corrupt sensual pleasures are forgotten. ||3||
The Name of the Lord is the medicine to cure all diseases; so serve the Lord, O humble Saints.
The four great blessings are obtained, O Nanak, by vibrating upon the Lord, under Guru's Instruction. ||4||4||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
Anyone, from any class - Kh'shaatriya, Brahman, Soodra or Vaishya - can chant, and meditate on the Mantra of the Lord's Name.
Worship the Guru, the True Guru, as the Supreme Lord God; serve Him constantly, all day and night. ||1||
O humble servants of the Lord, behold the True Guru with your eyes.
Whatever you wish for, you shall receive, chanting the Word of the Lord's Name, under Guru's Instruction. ||1||Pause||
People think of many and various efforts, but that alone happens, which is to happen.
All beings seek goodness for themselves, but what the Lord does - that may not be what we think and expect. ||2||
So renounce the clever intellect of your mind, O humble servants of the Lord, no matter how hard this may be.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; accept the wisdom of the Guru, the True Guru. ||3||
Wisdom, balanced wisdom is in Your power, O Lord and Master; I am the instrument, and You are the player, O Primal Lord.
O God, O Creator, Lord and Master of servant Nanak, as You wish, so do I speak. ||4||5||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
I meditate on the source of bliss, the Sublime Primal Being; night and day, I am in ecstasy and bliss.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma has no power over me; I have cast off all subservience to the Messenger of Death. ||1||
Meditate, O mind, on the Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe.
By great good fortune, I have found the Guru, the True Guru; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||
The foolish faithless cynics are held captive by Maya; in Maya, they continue wandering, wandering around.
Burnt by desire, and bound by the karma of their past actions, they go round and round, like the ox at the mill press. ||2||
The Gurmukhs, who focus on serving the Guru, are saved; by great good fortune, they perform service.
Those who meditate on the Lord obtain the fruits of their rewards, and the bonds of Maya are all broken. ||3||
He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the servant. The Lord of the Universe Himself is all by Himself.
O servant Nanak, He Himself is All-pervading; as He keeps us, we remain. ||4||6||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl, Partaal, Thirteenth House:
O Siblings of Destiny, chant the Name of the Lord, the Purifier of sinners.
The Lord emancipates his Saints and devotees.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 007

The Lord is totally permeating and pervading everywhere;
the Name of the Lord is pervading the water and the land.
So sing continuously of the Lord, the Dispeller of pain. ||1||Pause||
The Lord has made my life fruitful and rewarding.
I meditate on the Lord, the Dispeller of pain.
I have met the Guru, the Giver of liberation.
The Lord has made my life's journey fruitful and rewarding.
Joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
O mortal, place your hopes in the Name of the Lord,
and your love of duality shall simply vanish.
One who, in hope, remains unattached to hope,
such a humble being meets with his Lord.
And one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name
\- servant Nanak falls at his feet. ||2||1||7||4||6||7||17||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He is attached to what he sees.
How can I meet You, O Imperishable God?
Have Mercy upon me, and place me upon the Path;
let me be attached to the hem of the robe of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||
How can I cross over the poisonous world-ocean?
The True Guru is the boat to carry us across. ||1||Pause||
The wind of Maya blows and shakes us,
but the Lord's devotees remain ever-stable.
They remain unaffected by pleasure and pain.
The Guru Himself is the Savior above their heads. ||2||
Maya, the snake, holds all in her coils.
They burn to death in egotism, like the moth lured by seeing the flame.
They make all sorts of decorations, but they do not find the Lord.
When the Guru becomes Merciful, He leads them to meet the Lord. ||3||
I wander around, sad and depressed, seeking the jewel of the One Lord.
This priceless jewel is not obtained by any efforts.
That jewel is within the body, the Temple of the Lord.
The Guru has torn away the veil of illusion, and beholding the jewel, I am delighted. ||4||
One who has tasted it, comes to know its flavor;
he is like the mute, whose mind is filled with wonder.
I see the Lord, the source of bliss, everywhere.
Servant Nanak speaks the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and merges in Him. ||5||1||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Divine Guru has blessed me with total happiness.
He has linked His servant to His service.
No obstacles block my path, meditating on the incomprehensible, inscrutable Lord. ||1||
The soil has been sanctified, singing the Glories of His Praises.
The sins are eradicated, meditating on the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is pervading everywhere;
from the very beginning, and throughout the ages, His Glory has been radiantly manifest.
By Guru's Grace, sorrow does not touch me. ||2||
The Guru's Feet seem so sweet to my mind.
He is unobstructed, dwelling everywhere.
I found total peace, when the Guru was pleased. ||3||
The Supreme Lord God has become my Savior.
Wherever I look, I see Him there with me.
O Nanak, the Lord and Master protects and cherishes His slaves. ||4||2||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
You are the treasure of peace, O my Beloved God.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 008

Your Glories are uncounted, O God, my Lord and Master.
I am an orphan, entering Your Sanctuary.
Have Mercy on me, O Lord, that I may meditate on Your Feet. ||1||
Take pity upon me, and abide within my mind;
I am worthless - please let me grasp hold of the hem of Your robe. ||1||Pause||
When God comes into my consciousness, what misfortune can strike me?
The Lord's servant does not suffer pain from the Messenger of Death.
All pains are dispelled, when one remembers the Lord in meditation;
God abides with him forever. ||2||
The Name of God is the Support of my mind and body.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the body is reduced to ashes.
When God comes into my consciousness, all my affairs are resolved.
Forgetting the Lord, one becomes subservient to all. ||3||
I am in love with the Lotus Feet of the Lord.
I am rid of all evil-minded ways.
The Mantra of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, is deep within my mind and body.
O Nanak, eternal bliss fills the home of the Lord's devotees. ||4||3||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Second House, To Be Sung To The Tune Of Yaan-Ree-Ay:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You are the Support of my mind, O my Beloved, You are the Support of my mind.
All other clever tricks are useless, O Beloved; You alone are my Protector. ||1||Pause||
One who meets with the Perfect True Guru, O Beloved, that humble person is enraptured.
He alone serves the Guru, O Beloved, unto whom the Lord becomes merciful.
Fruitful is the form of the Divine Guru, O Lord and Master; He is overflowing with all powers.
O Nanak, the Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord; He is ever-present, forever and ever. ||1||
I live by hearing, hearing of those who know their God.
They contemplate the Lord's Name, they chant the Lord's Name, and their minds are imbued with the Lord's Name.
I am Your servant; I beg to serve Your humble servants. By the karma of perfect destiny, I do this.
This is Nanak's prayer: O my Lord and Master, may I obtain the Blessed Vision of Your humble servants. ||2||
They are said to be very fortunate, O Beloved, who who dwell in the Society of the Saints.
They contemplate the Immaculate, Ambrosial Naam, and their minds are illuminated.
The pains of birth and death are eradicated, O Beloved, and the fear of the Messenger of Death is ended.
They alone obtain the Blessed Vision of this Darshan, O Nanak, who are pleasing to their God. ||3||
O my lofty, incomparable and infinite Lord and Master, who can know Your Glorious Virtues?
Those who sing them are saved, and those who listen to them are saved; all their sins are erased.
You save the beasts, demons and fools, and even stones are carried across.
Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; he is forever and ever a sacrifice to You. ||4||1||4||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Renounce the tasteless water of corruption, O my companion, and drink in the supreme nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Without the taste of this nectar, all have drowned, and their souls have not found happiness.
You have no honor, glory or power - become the slave of the Holy Saints.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 009

O Nanak, they alone look beautiful in the Court of the Lord, whom the Lord has made His Own. ||1||
Maya is a mirage, which deludes the mind, O my companion, like the scent-crazed deer, or the transitory shade of a tree.
Maya is fickle, and does not go with you, O my companion; in the end, it will leave you.
He may enjoy pleasures and sensual delights with supremely beautiful women, but no one finds peace in this way.
Blessed, blessed are the humble, Holy Saints of the Lord, O my companion. O Nanak, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Go, O my very fortunate companion: dwell in the Company of the Saints, and merge with the Lord.
There, neither pain nor hunger nor disease will afflict you; enshrine love for the Lord's Lotus Feet.
There is no birth or death there, no coming or going in reincarnation, when you enter the Sanctuary of the Eternal Lord.
Love does not end, and attachment does not grip you, O Nanak, when you meditate on the One Lord. ||3||
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, my Beloved has pierced my mind, and I am intuitively attuned to His Love.
My bed is embellished, meeting with my Beloved; in ecstasy and bliss, I sing His Glorious Praises.
O my friends and companions, I am imbued with the Lord's Love; the desires of my mind and body are satisfied.
O Nanak, the wonder-struck soul blends with the Wonderful Lord; this state cannot be described. ||4||2||5||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The entire Universe is the form of the One Lord.
He Himself is the trade, and He Himself is the trader. ||1||
How rare is that one who is blessed with such spiritual wisdom.
Wherever I go, there I see Him. ||1||Pause||
He manifests many forms, while still unmanifest and absolute, and yet He has One Form.
He Himself is the water, and He Himself is the waves. ||2||
He Himself is the temple, and He Himself is selfless service.
He Himself is the worshipper, and He Himself is the idol. ||3||
He Himself is the Yoga; He Himself is the Way.
Nanak's God is forever liberated. ||4||1||6||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself creates, and He Himself supports.
He Himself causes all to act; He takes no blame Himself. ||1||
He Himself is the teaching, and He Himself is the teacher.
He Himself is the splendor, and He Himself is the experiencer of it. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is silent, and He Himself is the speaker.
He Himself is undeceivable; He cannot be deceived. ||2||
He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is manifest.
He Himself is in each and every heart; He Himself is unattached. ||3||
He Himself is absolute, and He Himself is with the Universe.
Says Nanak, all are beggars of God. ||4||2||7||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He places the one who strays back on the Path;
such a Guru is found by great good fortune. ||1||
Meditate, contemplate the Name of the Lord, O mind.
The Beloved Feet of the Guru abide within my heart. ||1||Pause||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 010

Caught in the illusion of Maya, you have forgotten the Supreme Lord. ||3||
By great good fortune, one sings the Kirtan of God's Praises.
In the Society of the Saints, Nanak has found God. ||4||11||16||

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
This perishable realm and world has been made like a house of sand.
In no time at all, it is destroyed, like the paper drenched with water. ||1||
Listen to me, people: behold, and consider this within your mind.
The Siddhas, the seekers, house-holders and Yogis have forsaken their homes and left. ||1||Pause||
This world is like a dream in the night.
All that is seen shall perish. Why are you attached to it, you fool? ||2||
Where are your brothers and friends? Open your eyes and see!
Some have gone, and some will go; everyone must take his turn. ||3||
Those who serve the Perfect True Guru, remain ever-stable at the Door of the Lord.
Servant Nanak is the Lord's slave; preserve his honor, O Lord, Destroyer of ego. ||4||1||31||

He alone knows its taste, who tastes the Priceless Name of the Lord.
Its value cannot be estimated; what can I say with my mouth? ||3||
Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Supreme Lord God. The Word of Your Bani is the treasure of virtue.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 015

Please bless me with the dust of the feet of Your slaves; Nanak is a sacrifice. ||4||3||33||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Keep me under Your Protection, God; shower me with Your Mercy.
I do not know how to serve You; I am just a low-life fool. ||1||
I take pride in You, O my Darling Beloved.
I am a sinner, continuously making mistakes; You are the Forgiving Lord. ||1||Pause||
I make mistakes each and every day. You are the Great Giver;
I am worthless. I associate with Maya, your hand-maiden, and I renounce You, God; such are my actions. ||2||
You bless me with everything, showering me with Mercy; And I am such an ungrateful wretch!
I am attached to Your gifts, but I do not even think of You, O my Lord and Master. ||3||
There is none other than You, O Lord, Destroyer of fear.
Says Nanak, I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Merciful Guru; I am so foolish - please, save me! ||4||4||34||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Don't blame anyone else; meditate on your God.
Serving Him, great peace is obtained; O mind, sing His Praises. ||1||
O Beloved, other than You, who else should I ask?
You are my Merciful Lord and Master; I am filled with all faults. ||1||Pause||
As You keep me, I remain; there is no other way.
You are the Support of the unsupported; You Name is my only Support. ||2||
One who accepts whatever You do as good - that mind is liberated.
The entire creation is Yours; all are subject to Your Ways. ||3||
I wash Your Feet and serve You, if it pleases You, O Lord and Master.
Be Merciful, O God of Compassion, that Nanak may sing Your Glorious Praises. ||4||5||35||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Death hovers over his head, laughing, but the beast does not understand.
Entangled in conflict, pleasure and egotism, he does not even think of death. ||1||
So serve your True Guru; why wander around miserable and unfortunate?
You gaze upon the transitory, beautiful safflower, but why do you get attached to it? ||1||Pause||
You commit sins again and again, to gather wealth to spend.
But your dust shall mix with dust; you shall arise and depart naked. ||2||
Those for whom you work, will become your spiteful enemies.
In the end, they will run away from you; why do you burn for them in anger? ||3||
He alone becomes the dust of the Lord's slaves, who has such good karma upon his forehead.
Says Nanak, he is released from bondage, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||4||6||36||

Filth is washed away, millions of sins are dispelled, and the consciousness becomes immaculate and pure. ||1||Pause||
Such is devotional worship of the Lord of the Universe, that the ant can overpower the elephant.
Whoever the Lord makes His own, is blessed with the gift of fearlessness. ||2||
The lion becomes a cat, and the mountain looks like a blade of grass.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 016

Those who worked for half a shell, will be judged very wealthy. ||3||
What glorious greatness of Yours can I describe, O Lord of infinite excellences?
Please bless me with Your Mercy, and grant me Your Name; O Nanak, I am lost without the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||4||7||37||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He is constantly entangled in pride, conflict, greed and tasty flavors.
He is involved in deception, fraud, household affairs and corruption. ||1||
I have seen this with my eyes, by the Grace of the Perfect Guru.
Power, property, wealth and youth are useless, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Beauty, incense, scented oils, beautiful clothes and foods
\- when they come into contact with the body of the sinner, they stink. ||2||
Wandering, wandering around, the soul is reincarnated as a human, but this body lasts only for an instant.
Losing this opportunity, he must wander again through countless incarnations. ||3||
By God's Grace, he meets the Guru; contemplating the Lord, Har, Har, he is wonderstruck.
He is blessed with peace, poise and bliss, O Nanak, through the perfect sound current of the Naad. ||4||8||38||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The feet of the Saints are the boat, to cross over the world-ocean.
In the wilderness, the Guru places them on the Path, and reveals the secrets of the Lord's Mystery. ||1||
O Lord, Har Har Har, Har Har Haray, Har Har Har, I love You.
While standing up, sitting down and sleeping, think of the Lord, Har Har Har. ||1||Pause||
The five thieves run away, when one joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
His investment is intact, and he earns great profits; his household is blessed with honor. ||2||
His position is unmoving and eternal, his anxiety is ended, and he wavers no more.
His doubts and misgivings are dispelled, and he sees God everywhere. ||3||
The Virtues of our Virtuous Lord and Master are so profound; how many of His Glorious Virtues should I speak?
Nanak has obtained the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Company of the Holy. ||4||9||39||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
That life, which has no contact with the Holy, is useless.
Joining their congregation, all doubts are dispelled, and I am emancipated. ||1||
That day, when I meet with the Holy - I am a sacrifice to that day.
Again and again, I sacrifice my body, mind and soul to them. ||1||Pause||
They have helped me renounce this ego, and implant this humility within myself.
This mind has become the dust of all men's feet, and my self-conceit has been dispelled. ||2||
In an instant, I burnt away the ideas of slander and ill-will towards others.
I see close at hand, the Lord of mercy and compassion; He is not far away at all. ||3||
My body and mind are cooled and soothed, and now, I am liberated from the world.
Love, consciousness, the breath of life, wealth and everything, O Nanak, are in the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||4||10||40||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I perform service for Your slave, O Lord, and wipe his feet with my hair.
I offer my head to him, and listen to the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the source of bliss. ||1||
Meeting You, my mind is rejuvenated, so please meet me, O Merciful Lord.
Night and day, my mind enjoys bliss, contemplating the Lord of Compassion. ||1||Pause||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 017

God's Holy people are the saviors of the world; I grab hold of the hem of their robes.
Bless me, O God, with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||2||
I have no skill or wisdom at all, nor any work to my credit.
Please, protect me from doubt, fear and emotional attachment, and cut away the noose of Death from my neck. ||3||
I beg of You, O Lord of Mercy, O my Father, please cherish me!
I sing Your Glorious Praises, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Lord, Home of peace. ||4||11||41||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever You wish, You do. Without You, there is nothing.
Gazing upon Your Glory, the Messenger of Death leaves and goes away. ||1||
By Your Grace, one is emancipated, and egotism is dispelled.
God is omnipotent, possessing all powers; He is obtained through the Perfect, Divine Guru. ||1||Pause||
Searching, searching, searching - without the Naam, everything is false.
All the comforts of life are found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; God is the Fulfiller of desires. ||2||
Whatever You attach me to, to that I am attached; I have burnt away all my cleverness.
You are permeating and pervading everywhere, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek. ||3||
I ask for everything from You, but only the very fortunate ones obtain it.
This is Nanak's prayer, O God, I live by singing Your Glorious Praises. ||4||12||42||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Dwelling in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all sins are erased.
One who is attuned to the Love of God, is not cast into the womb of reincarnation. ||1||

The intellect is brightened and illuminated; turning away from the world, the heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||
He is cooled and soothed, peaceful and content; all his thirst is quenched.
The mind's wandering in the ten directions is stopped, and one dwells in the immaculate place. ||3||
The Savior Lord saves him, and his doubts are burnt to ashes.
Nanak is blessed with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He finds peace, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan. ||4||13||43||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Carry water for the Lord's slave, wave the fan over him, and grind his corn; then, you shall be happy.
Burn in the fire your power, property and authority. ||1||
Grasp hold of the feet of the servant of the humble Saints.
Renounce and abandon the wealthy, the regal overlords and kings. ||1||Pause||
The dry bread of the Saints is equal to all treasures.
The thirty-six tasty dishes of the faithless cynic, are just like poison. ||2||
Wearing the old blankets of the humble devotees, one is not naked.
But by putting on the silk clothes of the faithless cynic, one loses one's honor. ||3||
Friendship with the faithless cynic breaks down mid-way.
But whoever serves the humble servants of the Lord, is emancipated here and hereafter. ||4||
Everything comes from You, O Lord; You Yourself created the creation.
Blessed with the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||5||14||44||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 018

Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
With my ears, I listen to the Lord, Har, Har; I sing the Praises of my Lord and Master.
I place my hands and my head upon the feet of the Saints, and meditate on the Lord's Name. ||1||
Be kind to me, O Merciful God, and bless me with this wealth and success.
Obtaining the dust of the feet of the Saints, I apply it to my forehead. ||1||Pause||
I am the lowest of the low, absolutely the lowest; I offer my humble prayer.
I wash their feet, and renounce my self-conceit; I merge in the Saints' Congregation. ||2||
With each and every breath, I never forget the Lord; I never go to another.
Obtaining the Fruitful Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I discard my pride and attachment. ||3||
I am embellished with truth, contentment, compassion and Dharmic faith.
My spiritual marriage is fruitful, O Nanak; I am pleasing to my God. ||4||15||45||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The words of the Holy are eternal and unchanging; this is apparent to everyone.
That humble being, who joins the Saadh Sangat, meets the Sovereign Lord. ||1||
This faith in the Lord of the Universe, and peace, are found by meditating on the Lord.
Everyone is speaking in various ways, but the Guru has brought the Lord into the home of my self. ||1||Pause||
He preserves the honor of those who seek His Sanctuary; there is no doubt about this at all.
In the field of actions and karma, plant the Lord's Name; this opportunity is so difficult to obtain! ||2||
God Himself is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; He does, and causes everything to be done.
He purifies so many sinners; this is the natural way of our Lord and Master. ||3||
Don't be fooled, O mortal being, by the illusion of Maya.
O Nanak, God saves the honor of those of whom He approves. ||4||16||46||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He fashioned you from clay, and made your priceless body.
He covers the many faults in your mind, and makes you look immaculate and pure. ||1||
So why do you forget God from your mind? He has done so many good things for you.
One who forsakes God, and blends himself with another, in the end is blended with dust. ||1||Pause||
Meditate, meditate in remembrance with each and every breath - do not delay!
Renounce worldly affairs, and merge yourself into God; forsake false loves. ||2||
He is many, and He is One; He takes part in the many plays. This is as He is, and shall be.
So serve that Supreme Lord God, and accept the Guru's Teachings. ||3||
God is said to be the highest of the high, the greatest of all, our companion.
Please, let Nanak be the slave of the slave of Your slaves. ||4||17||47||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe is my only Support. I have renounced all other hopes.
God is All-powerful, above all; He is the perfect treasure of virtue. ||1||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of the humble servant who seeks God's Sanctuary.
In their minds, the Saints take the Support of the Transcendent Lord. ||1||Pause||
He Himself preserves, and He Himself gives. He Himself cherishes.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 019

Merciful to the meek, the treasure of mercy, He remembers and protects us with each and every breath. ||2||
Whatever the Creator Lord does is glorious and great.
The Perfect Guru has instructed me, that peace comes by the Will of our Lord and Master. ||3||
Anxieties, worries and calculations are dismissed; the Lord's humble servant accepts the Hukam of His Command.
He does not die, and He does not leave; Nanak is attuned to His Love. ||4||18||48||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The great fire is put out and cooled; meeting with the Guru, sins run away.
I fell into the deep dark pit; giving me His Hand, He pulled me out. ||1||
He is my friend; I am the dust of His Feet.
Meeting with Him, I am at peace; He blesses me with the gift of the soul. ||1||Pause||
I have now received my pre-ordained destiny.
Dwelling with the Lord's Holy Saints, my hopes are fulfilled. ||2||
The fear of the three worlds is dispelled, and I have found my place of rest and peace.
The all-powerful Guru has taken pity upon me, and the Naam has come to dwell in my mind. ||3||
O God, You are the Anchor and Support of Nanak.
He is the Doer, the Cause of causes; the All-powerful Lord God is inaccessible and infinite. ||4||19||49||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
One who forgets God is filthy, poor and low.

If one human being serves another human being, the one served stands by him.
Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary and Protection, O Lord, ocean of peace; He takes the Support of Your Name alone. ||2||6||92||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints, and I serve the Saints.
I am rid of all worldly concerns, bonds, entanglements and other affairs. ||1||Pause||
I have obtained peace, poise and great bliss from the Guru, through the Lord's Name.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 029

Such is the sublime essence of the Lord, that I cannot describe it. The Perfect Guru has turned me away from the world. ||1||
I behold the Fascinating Lord with everyone. No one is without Him - He is pervading everywhere.
The Perfect Lord, the treasure of mercy, is permeating everywhere. Says Nanak, I am fully fulfilled. ||2||7||93||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
What does the mind say? What can I say?
You are wise and all-knowing, O God, my Lord and Master; what can I say to You? ||1||Pause||
You know even what is not said, whatever is in the soul.
O mind, why do you deceive others? How long will you do this? The Lord is with you; He hears and sees everything. ||1||
Knowing this, my mind has become blissful; there is no other Creator.
Says Nanak, the Guru has become kind to me; my love for the Lord shall never wear off. ||2||8||94||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Thus, the slanderer crumbles away.
This is the distinctive sign - listen, O Siblings of Destiny: he collapses like a wall of sand. ||1||Pause||
When the slanderer sees a fault in someone else, he is pleased. Seeing goodness, he is depressed.
Twenty-four hours a day, he plots, but nothing works. The evil man dies, constantly thinking up evil plans. ||1||
The slanderer forgets God, death approaches him, and he starts to argue with the humble servant of the Lord.
God Himself, the Lord and Master, is Nanak's protector. What can any wretched person do to him? ||2||9||95||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Why do you wander in delusion like this?
You act, and incite others to act, and then deny it. The Lord is always with you; He sees and hears everything. ||1||Pause||
You purchase glass, and discard gold; you are in love with your enemy, while you renounce your true friend.
That which exists, seems bitter; that which does not exist, seems sweet to you. Engrossed in corruption, you are burning away. ||1||
The mortal has fallen into the deep, dark pit, and is entangled in the darkness of doubt, and the bondage of emotional attachment.
Says Nanak, when God becomes merciful, one meets with the Guru, who takes him by the arm, and lifts him out. ||2||10||96||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
With my mind, body and tongue, I remember the Lord.
I am in ecstasy, and my anxieties are dispelled; the Guru has blessed me with total peace. ||1||Pause||
My ignorance has been totally transformed into wisdom. My God is wise and all-knowing.
Giving me His Hand, He saved me, and now no one can harm me at all. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Holy; by their Grace, I contemplate the Lord's Name.
Says Nanak, I place my faith in my Lord and Master; within my mind, I do not believe in any other, even for an instant. ||2||11||97||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Perfect Guru has has saved me.
He has enshrined the Ambrosial Name of the Lord within my heart, and the filth of countless incarnations has been washed away. ||1||Pause||
The demons and wicked enemies are driven out, by meditating, and chanting the Chant of the Perfect Guru.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 030

What can any wretched creature do to me? The radiance of my God is gloriously great. ||1||
Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance, I have found peace; I have enshrined His Lotus Feet within my mind.
Slave Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; there is none above Him. ||2||12||98||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Forever and ever, chant the Name of God.
The pains of old age and death shall not afflict you, and in the Court of the Lord hereafter, your affairs shall be perfectly resolved. ||1||Pause||
So forsake your self-conceit, and ever seek Sanctuary. This treasure is obtained only from the Guru.
The noose of birth and death is snapped; this is the insignia, the hallmark, of the Court of the True Lord. ||1||
Whatever You do, I accept as good. I have eradicated all egotistical pride from my mind.
Says Nanak, I am under His protection; He created the entire Universe. ||2||13||99||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Deep within the nucleus of his mind and body, is God.
He continually sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and always does good for others; his tongue is priceless. ||1||Pause||
All his generations are redeemed and saved in an instant, and the filth of countless incarnations is washed away.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, his Lord and Master, he passes blissfully through the forest of poison. ||1||
I have obtained the boat of God's Feet, to carry me across the terrifying world-ocean.
The Saints, servants and devotees belong to the Lord; Nanak's mind is attached to Him. ||2||14||100||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I am reassured, gazing upon Your wondrous play.
You are my Lord and Master, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; You dwell with the Holy Saints. ||1||Pause||
In an instant, our Lord and Master establishes and exalts. From a lowly worm, He creates a king. ||1||
May I never forget You from my heart; slave Nanak prays for this blessing. ||2||15||101||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The imperishable Lord God is worthy of worship and adoration.
Dedicating my mind and body, I place them before the Lord, the Cherisher of all beings. ||1||Pause||
His Sanctuary is All-powerful; He cannot be described; He is the Giver of peace, the ocean of mercy, supremely compassionate.
Holding him close in His embrace, the Lord protects and saves him, and then even the hot wind cannot touch him. ||1||
Our Merciful Lord and Master is wealth, property and everything to His humble Saints.
Nanak, a beggar, asks for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan; please, bless him with the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||2||16||102||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is equal to millions of efforts.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and the Messenger of Death will be frightened away. ||1||Pause||
To enshrine the Feet of God in one's mind and body, is to perform all sorts of acts of atonement.
Coming and going, doubt and fear have run away, and the sins of countless incarnations are burnt away. ||1||
So become fearless, and vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe. This is true wealth, obtained only by great good fortune.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 031

Be merciful, O Perfect God, Great Giver, that slave Nanak may chant Your immaculate Praises. ||2||17||103||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord saved me from Sulhi Khan.
The emperor did not succeed in his plot, and he died in disgrace. ||1||Pause||
The Lord and Master raised His axe, and chopped off his head; in an instant, he was reduced to dust. ||1||
Plotting and planning evil, he was destroyed. The One who created him, gave him a push.
Of his sons, friends and wealth, nothing remains; he departed, leaving behind all his brothers and relatives.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to God, who fulfilled the word of His slave. ||2||18||104||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Perfect is service to the Perfect Guru.
Our Lord and Master Himself is Himself all-pervading. The Divine Guru has resolved all my affairs. ||1||Pause||
In the beginning, in the middle and in the end, God is our only Lord and Master. He Himself fashioned His Creation.
He Himself saves His servant. Great is the glorious grandeur of my God! ||1||
The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord is the True Guru; all beings are in His power.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of His Lotus Feet, chanting the Lord's Name, the immaculate Mantra. ||2||19||105||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself protects me from suffering and sin.
Falling at the Guru's Feet, I am cooled and soothed; I meditate on the Lord's Name within my heart. ||1||Pause||

He is the Master of the masterless, All-powerful to give Sanctuary. He is the Mother and Father of the whole Universe.
He is the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear; Nanak sings and chants the Glorious Praises of his Lord and Master. ||2||20||106||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Acknowledge the One, from whom You originated.
Meditating on the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, I have found peace, pleasure and salvation. ||1||Pause||
I met the Perfect Guru, by great good fortune, and so found the wise and all-knowing Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
He gave me His Hand, and making me His own, He saved me; He is absolutely all-powerful, the honor of the dishonored. ||1||
Doubt and fear have been dispelled in an instant, and in the darkness, the Divine Light shines forth.
With each and every breath, Nanak worships and adores the Lord; forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||2||21||107||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Both here and hereafter, the Mighty Guru protects me.
God has embellished this world and the next for me, and all my affairs are perfectly resolved. ||1||Pause||
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have found peace and poise, bathing in the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Comings and goings have ceased, and I have found stability; the pains of birth and death are eradicated. ||1||
I cross over the ocean of doubt and fear, and the fear of death is gone; the One Lord is permeating and pervading in each and every heart.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 032

Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Destroyer of pain; I behold His Presence deep within, and all around as well. ||2||22||108||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, all pains run away.
Please, never leave my vision, O Lord; please abide with my soul. ||1||Pause||
My Beloved Lord and Master is the Support of the breath of life.
God, the Inner-knower, is all-pervading. ||1||
Which of Your Glorious Virtues should I contemplate and remember?
With each and every breath, O God, I remember You. ||2||
God is the ocean of mercy, merciful to the meek;
He cherishes all beings and creatures. ||3||
Twenty-four hours a day, Your humble servant chants Your Name.
You Yourself, O God, have inspired Nanak to love You. ||4||23||109||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Body, wealth and youth pass away.
You have not meditated and vibrated upon the Lord's Name; while you commit your sins of corruption in the night, the light of day dawns upon you. ||1||Pause||
Continually eating all sorts of foods, the teeth in your mouth crumble, decay and fall out.
Living in egotism and possessiveness, you are deluded; committing sins, you have no kindness for others. ||1||
The great sins are the terrible ocean of pain; the mortal is engrossed in them.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master; taking him by the arm, God has lifted him up and out. ||2||24||110||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
God Himself has come into my consciousness.
My enemies and opponents have grown weary of attacking me, and now, I have become happy, O my friends and Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
The disease is gone, and all misfortunes have been averted; the Creator Lord has made me His own.
I have found peace, tranquility and total bliss, enshrining the Name of my Beloved Lord within my heart. ||1||
My soul, body and wealth are all Your capital; O God, You are my All-powerful Lord and Master.
You are the Saving Grace of Your slaves; slave Nanak is forever Your slave. ||2||25||111||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe, I am emancipated.
Suffering is eradicated, and true peace has come, meditating on the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||1||Pause||
All beings belong to Him - He makes them happy. He is the true power of His humble devotees.
He Himself saves and protects His slaves, who believe in their Creator, the Destroyer of fear. ||1||

He hugs us close in His embrace, and protects His humble servants; attaching us to the hem of His robe, he saves us. ||1||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 033

Safe and sound, we have returned home, while the slanderer's face is blackened.
Says Nanak, my True Guru is Perfect; by the Grace of God and Guru, I am so happy. ||2||27||113||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I have fallen in love with my Beloved Lord. ||Pause||
Cutting it, it does not break, and releasing it, it does not let go. Such is the string the Lord has tied me with. ||1||
Day and night, He dwells within my mind; please bless me with Your Mercy, O my God. ||2||
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my beauteous Lord; I have heard his Unspoken Speech and Story. ||3||
Servant Nanak is said to be the slave of His slaves; O my Lord and Master, please bless me with Your Mercy. ||4||28||114||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I meditate on the Lord's Feet; I am a sacrifice to Them.
My Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord; I enshrine Him within my heart, and meditate on Him within my mind. ||1||Pause||
Meditate, meditate, meditate in remembrance on the Giver of peace, who created the whole Universe.
With your tongue, savor the One Lord, and you shall be honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||1||
He alone obtains this treasure, who joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
O Lord and Master, mercifully bless Nanak with this gift, that he may ever sing the Glorious Praises of Your Kirtan. ||2||29||115||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I have been saved, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
I am cheered and applauded throughout the world; my Supreme Lord God carries me across. ||1||Pause||
The Perfect Lord fills the Universe; He is the Giver of peace; He cherishes and fulfills the whole Universe.
He is completely filling all places and interspaces; I am a devoted sacrifice to the Lord's Feet. ||1||
The ways of all beings are in Your Power, O my Lord and Master. All supernatural spiritual powers are Yours; You are the Creator, the Cause of causes.
In the beginning, and throughout the ages, God is our Savior and Protector; remembering the Lord in meditation, O Nanak, fear is eliminated. ||2||30||116||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas, Eighth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am nothing, God; everything is Yours.
In this world, You are the absolute, formless Lord; in the world hereafter, You are the related Lord of form. You play it both ways, O my Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
You exist within the city, and beyond it as well; O my God, You are everywhere.
You Yourself are the King, and You Yourself are the subject. In one place, You are the Lord and Master, and in another place, You are the slave. ||1||
From whom should I hide? Whom should I try to deceive? Wherever I look, I see Him near at hand.
I have met with Guru Nanak, the Embodiment of the Holy Saints. When the drop of water merges into the ocean, it cannot be distinguished as separate again. ||2||1||117||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 034

You are the all-powerful Cause of causes.
Please cover my faults, Lord of the Universe, O my Guru; I am a sinner - I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. ||1||Pause||
Whatever we do, You see and know; there is no way anyone can stubbornly deny this.
Your glorious radiance is great! So I have heard, O God. Millions of sins are destroyed by Your Name. ||1||
It is my nature to make mistakes, forever and ever; it is Your Natural Way to save sinners.
You are the embodiment of kindness, and the treasure of compassion, O Merciful Lord; through the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, Nanak has found the state of redemption in life. ||2||2||118||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Bless me with such mercy, Lord,
that my forehead may touch the feet of the Saints, and my eyes may behold the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, and my body may fall at the dust of their feet. ||1||Pause||
May the Word of the Guru's Shabad abide within my heart, and the Lord's Name be enshrined within my mind.
Drive out the five thieves, O my Lord and Master, and let my doubts all burn like incense. ||1||
Whatever You do, I accept as good; I have driven out the sense of duality.
You are Nanak's God, the Great Giver; in the Congregation of the Saints, emancipate me. ||2||3||119||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I ask for such advice from Your humble servants,
that I may meditate on You, and love You,
and serve You, and become part and parcel of Your Being. ||1||Pause||
I serve His humble servants, and speak with them, and abide with them.
I apply the dust of the feet of His humble servants to my face and forehead; my hopes, and the many waves of desire, are fulfilled. ||1||
Immaculate and pure are the praises of the humble servants of the Supreme Lord God; the feet of His humble servants are equal to millions of sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Nanak bathes in the dust of the feet of His humble servants; the sinful resides of countless incarnations have been washed away. ||2||4||120||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
If it pleases You, then cherish me.
O Supreme Lord God, Transcendent Lord, O True Guru, I am Your child, and You are my Merciful Father. ||1||Pause||
I am worthless; I have no virtues at all. I cannot understand Your actions.
You alone know Your state and extent. My soul, body and property are all Yours. ||1||
You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Primal Lord and Master; You know even what is unspoken.
My body and mind are cooled and soothed, O Nanak, by God's Glance of Grace. ||2||5||121||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Keep me with You forever, O God.
You are my Beloved, the Enticer of my mind; without You, my life is totally useless. ||1||Pause||
In an instant, You transform the beggar into a king; O my God, You are the Master of the masterless.
You save Your humble servants from the burning fire; You make them Your own, and with Your Hand, You protect them. ||1||
I have found peace and cool tranquility, and my mind is satisfied; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, all struggles are ended.
Service to the Lord, O Nanak, is the treasure of treasures; all other clever tricks are useless. ||2||6||122||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 035

Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Never forget Your servant, O Lord.
Hug me close in Your embrace, O God, my Lord and Master; consider my primal love for You, O Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
It is Your Natural Way, God, to purify sinners; please do not keep my errors in Your Heart.
You are my life, my breath of life, O Lord, my wealth and peace; be merciful to me, and burn away the curtain of egotism. ||1||
Without water, how can the fish survive? Without milk, how can the baby survive?
Servant Nanak thirsts for the Lord's Lotus Feet; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of his Lord and Master's Darshan, he finds the essence of peace. ||2||7||123||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Here, and hereafter, there is happiness.
The Perfect Guru has perfectly, totally saved me; the Supreme Lord God has been kind to me. ||1||Pause||
The Lord, my Beloved, is pervading and permeating my mind and body; all my pains and sufferings are dispelled.
In celestial peace, tranquility and bliss, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; my enemies and adversaries have been totally destroyed. ||1||
God has not considered my merits and demerits; in His Mercy, He has made me His own.
Unweighable is the greatness of the immovable and imperishable Lord; Nanak proclaims the victory of the Lord. ||2||8||124||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Fear of God, and devotional worship, how can anyone cross over the world-ocean?
Be kind to me, O Saving Grace of sinners; preserve my faith in You, O my Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
The mortal does not remember the Lord in meditation; he wanders around intoxicated by egotism; he is engrossed in corruption like a dog.
Utterly cheated, his life is slipping away; committing sins, he is sinking away. ||1||
I have come to Your Sanctuary, Destroyer of pain; O Primal Immaculate Lord, may I dwell upon You in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
O Lord of beautiful hair, Destroyer of pain, Eradicator of sins, Nanak lives, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||2||9||125||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas, Ninth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He Himself merges us with Himself.
When I came to Your Sanctuary, my sins vanished. ||1||Pause||
Renouncing egotistical pride and other anxieties, I have sought the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints.
Chanting, meditating on Your Name, O my Beloved, disease is eradicated from my body. ||1||
Even utterly foolish, ignorant and thoughtless persons have been saved by the Kind Lord.
Says Nanak, I have met the Perfect Guru; my comings and goings have ended. ||2||1||126||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Hearing Your Name, I live.
When the Perfect Guru became pleased with me, then my hopes were fulfilled. ||1||Pause||
Pain is gone, and my mind is comforted; the music of bliss fascinates me.
The yearning to meet my Beloved God has welled up within me. I cannot live without Him, even for an instant. ||1||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 036

You have saved so many devotees, so many humble servants; so many silent sages contemplate You.
The support of the blind, the wealth of the poor; Nanak has found God, of endless virtues. ||2||2||127||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Thirteenth House, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Enticing Lord, I cannot sleep; I sigh. I am adorned with necklaces, gowns, ornaments and make-up.
I am sad, sad and depressed.
When will You come home? ||1||Pause||
I seek the Sanctuary of the happy soul-brides; I place my head upon their feet.
Unite me with my Beloved.
When will He come to my home? ||1||
Listen, my companions: tell me how to meet Him. Eradicate all egotism, and then you shall find your Beloved Lord within the home of your heart.
Then, in delight, you shall sing the songs of joy and praise.
Meditate on the Lord, the embodiment of bliss.
O Nanak, I came to the Lord's Door,
and then, I found my Beloved. ||2||
The Enticing Lord has revealed His form to me,
and now, sleep seems sweet to me.
My thirst is totally quenched,
and now, I am absorbed in celestial bliss.
How sweet is the story of my Husband Lord.
I have found my Beloved, Enticing Lord. ||Second Pause||1||128||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
My ego is gone; I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
I am absorbed in my Lord and Master, the help and support of the Saints.
Now, I hold tight to His Feet. ||1||Pause||
My mind longs for Him, and does not love any other. I am totally absorbed, in love with His Lotus Feet, like the bumble bee attached to the honey of the lotus flower.
I do not desire any other taste; I seek only the One Lord. ||1||
I have broken away from the others, and I have been released from the Messenger of Death.
O mind, drink in the subtle essence of the Lord; join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and turn away from the world.
There is no other, none other than the Lord.
O Nanak, love the Feet, the Feet of the Lord. ||2||2||129||
Raag Bilaaval, Ninth Mehl, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Name of the Lord is the Dispeller of sorrow - realize this.
Remembering Him in meditation, even Ajaamal the robber and Ganikaa the prostitute were liberated; let your soul know this. ||1||Pause||
The elephant's fear was taken away in an instant, as soon as he chanted the Lord's Name.
Listening to Naarad's teachings, the child Dhroo was absorbed in deep meditation. ||1||
He obtained the immovable, eternal state of fearlessness, and all the world was amazed.
Says Nanak, the Lord is the Saving Grace and the Protector of His devotees; believe it - He is close to you. ||2||1||
Bilaaval, Ninth Mehl:
Without the Name of the Lord, you shall only find pain.
Without devotional worship, doubt is not dispelled; the Guru has revealed this secret. ||1||Pause||
Of what use are sacred shrines of pilgrimage, if one does not enter the Sanctuary of the Lord?

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 037

Know that Yoga and sacrificial feasts are fruitless, if one forgets the Praises of God. ||1||
One who lays aside both pride and attachment, sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
Says Nanak, the mortal who does this is said to be ‘jivan mukta’ - liberated while yet alive. ||2||2||
Bilaaval, Ninth Mehl:
There is no meditation on the Lord within him.
That man wastes his life uselessly - keep this in mind. ||1||Pause||
He bathes at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and adheres to fasts, but he has no control over his mind.
Know that such religion is useless to him. I speak the Truth for his sake. ||1||
It's like a stone, kept immersed in water; still, the water does not penetrate it.
So, understand it: that mortal being who lacks devotional worship is just like that. ||2||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, liberation comes from the Naam. The Guru has revealed this secret.
Says Nanak, he alone is a great man, who sings the Praises of God. ||3||3||
Bilaaval, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, Tenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He dwells close at hand, and sees all,
but how rare is the Gurmukh who understands this.
Without the Fear of God, there is no devotional worship.
Imbued with the Word of the Shabad, eternal peace is attained. ||1||
Such is the spiritual wisdom, the treasure of the Naam;
obtaining it, the Gurmukhs enjoy the subtle essence of this nectar. ||1||Pause||
Everyone talks about spiritual wisdom and spiritual knowledge.
Talking, talking, they argue, and suffer.
No one can stop talking and discussing it.
Without being imbued with the subtle essence, there is no liberation. ||2||
Spiritual wisdom and meditation all come from the Guru.
Through the lifestyle of Truth, the True Lord comes to dwell in the mind.
The self-willed manmukh talks about it, but does not practice it.
Forgetting the Name, he finds no place of rest. ||3||
Maya has caught the mind in the trap of the whirlpool.
Each and every heart is trapped by this bait of poison and sin.
See that whoever has come, is subject to death.
Your affairs shall be adjusted, if you contemplate the Lord in your heart. ||4||
He alone is a spiritual teacher, who lovingly focuses his consciousness on the Word of the Shabad.
The self-willed, egotistical manmukh loses his honor.
The Creator Lord Himself inspires us to His devotional worship.
He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness. ||5||
The life-night is dark, while the Divine Light is immaculate.
Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are false, filthy and untouchable.
The Vedas preach sermons of devotional worship.
Listening, hearing and believing, one beholds the Divine Light. ||6||
The Shaastras and Simritees implant the Naam within.
The Gurmukh lives in peace and tranquility, doing deeds of sublime purity.
The self-willed manmukh suffers the pains of reincarnation.
His bonds are broken, enshrining the Name of the One Lord. ||7||
Believing in the Naam, one obtains true honor and adoration.
Who should I see? There is none other than the Lord.
I see, and I say, that He alone is pleasing to my mind.
Says Nanak, there is no other at all. ||8||1||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 038

Bilaaval, First Mehl:
The human acts according to the wishes of the mind.
This mind feeds on virtue and vice.
Intoxicated with the wine of Maya, satisfaction never comes.
Satisfaction and liberation come, only to one whose mind is pleasing to the True Lord. ||1||
Gazing upon his body, wealth, wife and all his possessions, he is proud.
But without the Name of the Lord, nothing shall go along with him. ||1||Pause||
He enjoys tastes, pleasures and joys in his mind.
But his wealth will pass on to other people, and his body will be reduced to ashes.
The entire expanse, like dust, shall mix with dust.
Without the Word of the Shabad, his filth is not removed. ||2||
The various songs, tunes and rhythms are false.
Trapped by the three qualities, people come and go, far from the Lord.
In duality, the pain of their evil-mindedness does not leave them.
But the Gurmukh is emancipated by taking the medicine, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
He may wear a clean loin-cloth, apply the ceremonial mark to his forehead, and wear a mala around his neck;
but if there is anger within him, he is merely reading his part, like an actor in a play.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he drinks in the wine of Maya.
Without devotional worship to the Guru, there is no peace. ||4||
The human is a pig, a dog, a donkey, a cat,
a beast, a filthy, lowly wretch, an outcast,
if he turns his face away from the Guru. He shall wander in reincarnation.
Bound in bondage, he comes and goes. ||5||
Serving the Guru, the treasure is found.
With the Naam in the heart, one always prospers.
And in the Court of the True Lord, you shall not called to account.
One who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, is approved at the Lord's Door. ||6||
Meeting the True Guru, one knows the Lord.
Understanding the Hukam of His Command, one acts according to His Will.
Understanding the Hukam of His Command, he dwells in the Court of the True Lord.
Through the Shabad, death and birth are ended. ||7||
He remains detached, knowing that everything belongs to God.
He dedicates his body and mind unto the One who owns them.
He does not come, and he does not go.
O Nanak, absorbed in Truth, he merges in the True Lord. ||8||2||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, Tenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The world is like a crow; with its beak, it croaks spiritual wisdom.
But deep within there is greed, falsehood and pride.
Without the Name of the Lord, your thin outer covering shall wear off, you fool. ||1||
Serving the True Guru, the Naam shall dwell in your conscious mind.
Meeting with the Guru, the Name of the Lord comes to mind. Without the Name, other loves are false. ||1||Pause||
So do that work, which the Guru tells you to do.
Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, you shall come to the home of celestial bliss.
Through the True Name, you shall obtain glorious greatness. ||2||
One who does not understand his own self, but still tries to instruct others,
is mentally blind, and acts in blindness.
How can he ever find a home and a place of rest, in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence? ||3||
Serve the Dear Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts;
deep within each and every heart, His Light is shining forth.
How can anyone hide anything from Him? ||4||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 039

The True Name is known through the True Word of the Shabad.
The Lord Himself meets that one who eradicates egotistical pride.
The Gurmukh chants the Naam, forever and ever. ||5||
Serving the True Guru, duality and evil-mindedness are taken away.
Guilty mistakes are erased, and the sinful intellect is cleansed.
One's body sparkles like gold, and one's light merges into the Light. ||6||
Meeting with the True Guru, one is blessed with glorious greatness.
Pain is taken away, and the Naam comes to dwell within the heart.
Imbued with the Naam, one finds eternal peace. ||7||
Obeying the Gur's instructions, one's actions are purified.
Obeying the Guru's Instructions, one finds the state of salvation.
O Nanak, those who follow the Guru's Teachings are saved, along with their families. ||8||1||3||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Eleventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
One who eliminates his self-centeredness, and eradicates his ego, night and day sings the songs of the Lord's Love.
The Gurmukh is inspired, his body is golden, and his light merges into the Light of the Fearless Lord. ||1||
I take the Support of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
I cannot live, for a moment, even for an instant, without the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukh reads the Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
In the one house of the body, there are ten gates; night and day, the five thieves break in.
They steal the entire wealth of one's Dharmic faith, but the blind, self-willed manmukh does not know it. ||2||
The fortress of the body is overflowing with gold and jewels; when it is awakened by spiritual wisdom, one enshrines love for the essence of reality.
The thieves and robbers hide out in the body; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they are arrested and locked up. ||3||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the boat, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the boatman, to carry us across.
The Messenger of Death, the tax collector, does not even come close, and no thieves or robbers can plunder you. ||4||
I continuously sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, day and night; singing the Lord's Praises, I cannot find His limits.
The mind of the Gurmukh returns to its own home; it meets the Lord of the Universe, to the beat of the celestial drum. ||5||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan with my eyes, my mind is satisfied; with my ears, I listen to the Guru's Bani, and the Word of His Shabad.
Listening, listening, my soul is softened, delighted by His subtle essence, chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe. ||6||
In the grip of the three qualities, they are engrossed in love and attachment to Maya; only as Gurmukh do they find the absolute quality, absorption in bliss.
With a single, impartial eye, look upon all alike, and see God pervading all. ||7||
The Light of the Lord's Name permeates all; the Gurmukh knows the unknowable.
O Nanak, the Lord has become merciful to the meek; through loving adoration, he merges in the Lord's Name. ||8||1||4||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
Meditate on the cool water of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Perfume yourself with the fragrant scent of the Lord, the sandalwood tree.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 040

Joining the Society of the Saints, I have obtained the supreme status. I am just a castor-oil tree, made fragrant by their association. ||1||
Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Master of the world, the Lord of creation.
Those humble beings who seek the Lord's Sanctuary are saved, like Prahlaad; they are emancipated and merge with the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Of all plants, the sandalwood tree is the most sublime. Everything near the sandalwood tree becomes fragrant like sandalwood.
The stubborn, false faithless cynics are dried up; their egotistical pride separates them far from the Lord. ||2||
Only the Creator Lord Himself knows the state and condition of everyone; the Lord Himself makes all the arrangements.
One who meets the True Guru is transformed into gold. Whatever is pre-ordained, is not erased by erasing. ||3||
The treasure of jewels is found in the ocean of the Guru's Teachings. The treasure of devotional worship is opened to me.
Focused on the Guru's Feet, faith wells up within me; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I hunger for more. ||4||
I am totally detached, continually, continuously meditating on the Lord; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I express my love for Him.
Time and time again, each and every moment and instant, I express it. I cannot find the Lord's limits; He is the farthest of the far. ||5||
The Shaastras, the Vedas and the Puraanas advise righteous actions, and the performance of the six religious rituals.
The hypocritical, self-willed manmukhs are ruined by doubt; in the waves of greed, their boat is heavily loaded, and it sinks. ||6||
So chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and through the Naam, find emancipation. The Simritees and Shaastras recommend the Naam.
Eradicating egotism, one becomes pure. The Gurmukh is inspired, and obtains the supreme status. ||7||
This world, with its colors and forms, is all Yours, O Lord; as You attach us, so do we do our deeds.
O Nanak, we are the instruments upon which He plays; as He wills, so is the path we take. ||8||2||5||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
The Gurmukh meditates on the Inaccessible, Unfathomable Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the True Guru, the True Primal Being.
He has brought the Lord's Name to dwell upon my breath of life; meeting with the True Guru, I am absorbed into the Lord's Name. ||1||
The Name of the Lord is the only Support of His humble servants.
I shall live under the protection of the True Guru. By Guru's Grace, I shall attain the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
This body is the field of karma; the Gurmukhs plow and work it, and harvest the essence.
The priceless jewel of the Naam becomes manifest, and it pours into their vessels of love. ||2||
Become the slave of the slave of the slave, of that humble being who has become the devotee of the Lord.
I dedicate my mind and intellect, and place them in offering before my Guru; by Guru's Grace, I speak the Unspoken. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in attachment to Maya; their minds are thirsty, burning with desire.
Following the Guru's Teachings, I have obtained the Ambrosial Water of the Naam, and the fire has been put out. The Word of the Guru's Shabad has put it out. ||4||
This mind dances before the True Guru. The unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds, vibrating the celestial melody.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 041

I praise the Lord, day and night, moving my feet to the beat of the drum. ||5||
Imbued with the Lord's Love, my mind sings His Praise, joyfully chanting the Shabad, the source of nectar and bliss.
The stream of immaculate purity flows through the home of the self within; one who drinks it in, finds peace. ||6||
The stubborn-minded, egotistical, proud-minded person performs rituals, but these are like sand castles built by children.
When the waves of the ocean come in, they crumble and dissolve in an instant. ||7||
The Lord is the pool, and the Lord Himself is the ocean; this world is all a play which He has staged.
As the waves of water merge into the water again, O Nanak, so does He merge into Himself. ||8||3||6||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
My mind wears the ear-rings of the True Guru's acquaintance; I apply the ashes of the Word of the Guru's Shabad to my body.
By body has become immortal, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Both birth and death have come to an end for me. ||1||
O my mind, remain united with the Saadh Sangat.
Be merciful to me, O Lord; each and every instant, let me wash the Feet of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
Forsaking family life, he wanders in the forest, but his mind does not remain at rest, even for an instant.
The wandering mind returns home, only when it seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Holy people. ||2||
The Sannyaasi renounces his daughters and sons, but his mind still conjures up all sorts of hopes and desires.
With these hopes and desires, he still does not understand, that only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad does one become free of desires, and find peace. ||3||
When detachment from the world wells up within, he become a naked hermit, but still, his mind roams, wanders and rambles in the ten directions.
He wanders around, but his desires are not satisfied; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he finds the house of kindness and compassion. ||4||
The Siddhas learn many Yogis postures, but their minds still yearn for riches, miraculous powers and energy.
Satisfaction, contentment and tranquility do not come to their minds; but meeting the Holy Saints, they are satisfied, and through the Name of the Lord, spiritual perfection is attained. ||5||
Life is born from the egg, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth; God created the beings and creatures of all colors and forms.
One who seeks the Sanctuary of the Holy is saved, whether he is a Kh'shaatriya, a Brahmin, a Soodra, a Vaishya or the most untouchable of the untouchables. ||6||
Naam Dayv, Jai Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan and Ravi Daas the low-caste leather-worker,
blessed Dhanna and Sain; all those who joined the humble Saadh Sangat, met the Merciful Lord. ||7||
The Lord protects the honor of His humble servants; He is the Lover of His devotees - He makes them His own.
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Life of the world, who has showered His Mercy upon him, and saved him. ||8||||4||7||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
The thirst for God has welled up deep within me; hearing the Word of the Guru's Teachings, my mind is pierced by His arrow.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 042

The pain of my mind is known only to my own mind; who can know the pain of another? ||1||
The Lord, the Guru, the Enticer, has enticed my mind.
I am stunned and amazed, gazing upon my Guru; I have entered the realm of wonder and bliss. ||1||Pause||
I wander around, exploring all lands and foreign countries; within my mind, I have such a great longing to see my God.
I sacrifice my mind and body to the Guru, who has shown me the Way, the Path to my Lord God. ||2||
If only someone would bring me news of God; He seems so sweet to my heart, mind and body.
I would cut off my head and place it under the feet of that one who leads me to meet and unite with my Lord God. ||3||
Let us go, O my companions, and understand our God; with the spell of virtue, let us obtain our Lord God.
He is called the Lover of His devotees; let us follow in the footsteps of those who seek God's Sanctuary. ||4||
If the soul-bride adorns herself with compassion and forgiveness, God is pleased, and her mind is illumined with the lamp of the Guru's wisdom.
With happiness and ecstasy, my God enjoys her; I offer each and every bit of my soul to Him. ||5||
I have made the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, my necklace; my mind tinged with devotion is the intricate ornament of crowning glory.
I have spread out my bed of faith in the Lord, Har, Har. I cannot abandon Him - my mind is filled with such a great love for Him. ||6||
If God says one thing, and the soul-bride does something else, then all her decorations are useless and false.
She may adorn herself to meet her Husband Lord, but still, only the virtuous soul-bride meets God, and the other's face is spat upon. ||7||
I am Your hand-maiden, O Inaccessible Lord of the Universe; what can I do by myself? I am under Your power.
Be merciful, Lord, to the meek, and save them; Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, and the Guru. ||8||5||8||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
My mind and body are filled with love for my Inaccessible Lord and Master. Each and every instant, I am filled with immense faith and devotion.
Gazing upon the Guru, my mind's faith is fulfilled, like the song-bird, which cries and cries, until the rain-drop falls into its mouth. ||1||
Join with me, join with me, O my companions, and teach me the Sermon of the Lord.
The True Guru has mercifully united me with God. Cutting off my head, and chopping it into pieces, I offer it to Him. ||1||Pause||
Each and every hair on my head, and my mind and body, suffer the pains of separation; without seeing my God, I cannot sleep.
The doctors and healers look at me, and are perplexed. Within my heart, mind and body, I feel the pain of divine love. ||2||
I cannot live for a moment, for even an instant, without my Beloved, like the opium addict who cannot live without opium.
Those who thirst for God, do not love any other. Without the Lord, there is no other at all. ||3||
If only someone would come and unite me with God; I am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to him.
After being separated from the Lord for countless incarnations, I am re-united with Him, entering the Sanctuary of the True, True, True Guru. ||4||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 043

There is one bed for the soul-bride, and the same bed for God, her Lord and Master. The self-willed manmukh does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; she wanders around, in limbo.
Uttering, “Guru, Guru”, she seeks His Sanctuary; so God comes to meet her, without a moment's delay. ||5||
One may perform many rituals, but the mind is filled with hypocrisy, evil deeds and greed.
When a son is born in the house of a prostitute, who can tell the name of his father? ||6||
Because of devotional worship in my past incarnations, I have been born into this life. The Guru has inspired me to worship the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har.
Worshipping, worshipping Him with devotion, I found the Lord, and then I merged into the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. ||7||
God Himself came and ground the henna leaves into powder, and applied it to my body.
Our Lord and Master showers His Mercy upon us, and grasps hold of our arms; O Nanak, He lifts us up and saves us. ||8||6||9||2||1||6||9||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Twelfth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I cannot express the Praises of my God; I cannot express His Praises.
I have abandoned all others, seeking His Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||
God's Lotus Feet are Infinite.
I am forever a sacrifice to Them.
My mind is in love with Them.
If I were to abandon Them, there is nowhere else I could go. ||1||
I chant the Lord's Name with my tongue.
The filth of my sins and evil mistakes is burnt off.
Climbing aboard the Boat of the Saints, I am emancipated.
I have been carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
My mind is tied to the Lord with the string of love and devotion.
This is the Immaculate Way of the Saints.
They forsake sin and corruption.
They meet the Formless Lord God. ||3||
Gazing upon God, I am wonderstruck.
I taste the Perfect Flavor of Bliss.
I do not waver or wander here or there.
The Lord God, Har, Har, dwells within my consciousness. ||4||
Those who constantly remember God, the treasure of virtue, will never go to hell.
Those who listen, fascinated, to the Unstruck Sound-Current of the Word, will never have to see the Messenger of Death with their eyes. ||5||
I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Heroic Lord of the World.
The Merciful Lord God is under the power of His devotees.
The Vedas do not know the Mystery of the Lord.
The silent sages constantly serve Him. ||6||
He is the Destroyer of the pains and sorrows of the poor.
It is so very difficult to serve Him.
No one knows His limits.
He is pervading the water, the land and the sky. ||7||
Hundreds of thousands of times, I humbly bow to Him.
I have grown weary, and I have collapsed at God's Door.
O God, make me the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Please fulfill this, Nanak's wish. ||8||1||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
God, please release me from birth and death.
I have grown weary, and collapsed at Your door.
I grasp Your Feet, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The Love of the Lord, Har, Har, is sweet to my mind.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 044

Be Merciful, and attach me to the hem of Your robe.
Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O Merciful Master of the meek, You are my Lord and Master, O Merciful Master of the meek.
I yearn for the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||Pause||
The world is a pit of poison,
filled with the utter darkness of ignorance and emotional attachment.
Please take my hand, and save me, Dear God.
Please bless me with Your Name, Lord.
Without You, God, I have no place at all.
Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||2||
The human body is in the grip of greed and attachment.
Without meditating and vibrating upon the Lord, it is reduced to ashes.
The Messenger of Death is dreadful and horrible.
The recording scribes of the conscious and the unconscious, Chitr and Gupt, know all actions and karma.
Day and night, they bear witness.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||3||
O Lord, Destroyer of fear and egotism,
be merciful, and save the sinners.
My sins cannot even be counted.
Without the Lord, who can hide them?
I thought of Your Support, and seized it, O my Lord and Master.
Please, give Nanak Your hand and save him, Lord! ||4||
The Lord, the treasure of virtue, the Lord of the world,
cherishes and and sustains every heart.
My mind is thirsty for Your Love, and the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
O Lord of the Universe, please fulfill my hopes.
I cannot survive, even for an instant.
By great good fortune, Nanak has found the Lord. ||5||
Without You, God, there is no other at all.
My mind loves You, as the partridge loves the moon,
as the fish loves the water,
as the bee and the lotus cannot be separated.
As the chakvi bird longs for the sun,
so does Nanak thirst for the Lord's feet. ||6||
As the young bride places the hopes of her life in her husband,
as the greedy person looks upon the gift of wealth,
as milk is joined to water,
as food is to the very hungry man,
and as the mother loves her son,
so does Nanak constantly remember the Lord in meditation. ||7||
As the moth falls into the lamp,
as the thief steals without hesitation,
as the elephant is trapped by its sexual urges,
as the sinner is caught in his sins,
as the gambler's addiction does not leave him,
so is this mind of Nanak's attached to the Lord. ||8||
As the deer loves the sound of the bell,
and as the song-bird longs for the rain,
the Lord's humble servant lives in the Society of the Saints,
lovingly meditating and vibrating upon the Lord of the Universe.
My tongue chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||9||
One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and hears them, and writes them,
receives all fruits and rewards from the Lord.
He saves all his ancestors and generations,
and crosses over the world-ocean.
The Lord's Feet are the boat to carry him across.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he sings the Praises of the Lord.
The Lord protects his honor.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's door. ||10||2||
Bilaaval, First Mehl, T'hitee ~ The Lunar Days, Tenth House, To The Drum-Beat Jat:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The First Day: The One Universal Creator is unique,
immortal, unborn, beyond social class or involvement.
He is inaccessible and unfathomable, with no form or feature.
Searching, searching, I have seen Him in each and every heart.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 045

I am a sacrifice to one who sees, and inspires others to see Him.
By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status. ||1||
Whose Name should I chant, and meditate on, except the Lord of the Universe?
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is revealed within the home of one's own heart. ||1||Pause||
The Second Day: Those who are in love with another, come to regret and repent.
The are tied up at Death's door, and continue coming and going.
What have they brought, and what will they take with them when they go?
The Messenger of Death looms over their heads, and they endure his beating.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, no one finds release.
Practicing hypocrisy, no one finds liberation. ||2||
The True Lord Himself created the universe, joining the elements together.
Breaking the cosmic egg, He united, and separated.
He made the earth and the sky into places to live.
He created day and night, fear and love.
The One who created the Creation, also watches over it.
There is no other Creator Lord. ||3||
The Third Day: He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,
the gods, goddesses and various manifestations.
The lights and forms cannot be counted.
The One who fashioned them, knows their value.
He evaluates them, and totally pervades them.
Who is close, and who is far away? ||4||
The Fourth Day: He created the four Vedas,
the four sources of creation, and distinct forms of speech.
He created the eighteen Puraanas, the six Shaastras and the three qualities.
He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand.
One who overcomes the three qualities, dwells in the fourth state.
Prays Nanak, I am his slave. ||5||
The Fifth Day: The five elements are demons.
The Lord Himself is unfathomable and detached.
Some are gripped by doubt, hunger, emotional attachment and desire.
Some taste the sublime essence of the Shabad, and are satisfied.
Some are imbued with the Lord's Love, while some die, and are reduced to dust.
Some attain the Court and the Mansion of the True Lord, and behold Him, ever-present. ||6||
The false one has no honor or fame;
like the black crow, he never becomes pure.
He is like the bird, imprisoned in a cage;
he paces back and forth behind the bars, but he is not released.
He alone is emancipated, whom the Lord and Master emancipates.
He follows the Guru's Teachings, and enshrines devotional worship. ||7||
The Sixth Day: God organized the six systems of Yoga.
The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates of itself.
If God wills it so, then one is summoned to the Mansion of His Presence.
One who is pierced through by the Shabad, obtains honor.
Those who wear religious robes burn, and are ruined.
Through Truth, the truthful ones merge into the True Lord. ||8||
The Seventh Day: When the body is imbued with Truth and contentment,
the seven seas within are filled with the Immaculate Water.
Bathing in good conduct, and contemplating the True Lord within the heart,
one obtains the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and carries everyone across.
With the True Lord in the mind, and the True Lord lovingly on one's lips,
one is blessed with the banner of Truth, and meets with no obstructions. ||9||
The Eighth Day: The eight miraculous powers come when one subdues his own mind,
and contemplates the True Lord through pure actions.
Forget the three qualities of wind, water and fire,
and concentrate on the pure True Name.
That human who remains lovingly focused on the Lord,
prays Nanak, shall not be consumed by death. ||10||
The Ninth Day: The Name is the supreme almighty Master of the nine masters of Yoga, the nine realms of the earth, and each and every heart.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 046

This whole world is the child of Maya.
I bow in submission to God, my Protector from the very beginning of time.
He was in the beginning, He has been throughout the ages, He is now, and He shall always be.
He is unlimited, and capable of doing everything. ||11||
The Tenth Day: Meditate on the Naam, give to charity, and purify yourself.
Night and day, bathe in spiritual wisdom and the Glorious Virtues of the True Lord.
Truth cannot be polluted; doubt and fear run away from it.
The flimsy thread breaks in an instant.
Know that the world is just like this thread.
Your consciousness shall become steady and stable, enjoying the Love of the True Lord. ||12||
The Eleventh Day: Enshrine the One Lord within your heart.
Eradicate cruelty, egotism and emotional attachment.
Earn the fruitful rewards, by observing the fast of knowing your own self.
One who is engrossed in hypocrisy, does not see the true essence.
The Lord is immaculate, self-sustaining and unattached.
The Pure, True Lord cannot be polluted. ||13||
Wherever I look, I see the One Lord there.
He created the other beings, of many and various kinds.
Eating only fruits, one loses the fruits of life.
Eating only delicacies of various sorts, one loses the true taste.
In fraud and greed, people are engrossed and entangled.
The Gurmukh is emancipated, practicing Truth. ||14||
The Twelfth Day: One whose mind is not attached to the twelve signs,
remains awake day and night, and never sleeps.
He remains awake and aware, lovingly centered on the Lord.
With faith in the Guru, he is not consumed by death.
Those who become detached, and conquer the five enemies
\- prays Nanak, they are lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||15||
The Twelfth Day: Know, and practice, compassion and charity.
Bring your out-going mind back home.
Observe the fast of remaining free of desire.
Chant the unchanted Chant of the Naam with your mouth.
Know that the One Lord is contained in the three worlds.
Purity and self-discipline are all contained in knowing the Truth. ||16||
The Thirteenth Day: He is like a tree on the sea-shore.
But his roots can become immortal, if his mind is attuned to the Lord's Love.
Then, he will not die of fear or anxiety, and he will never drown.
Without the Fear of God, he drowns and dies, and loses his honor.
With the Fear of God in his heart, and his heart in the Fear of God, he knows God.
He sits on the throne, and becomes pleasing to the Mind of the True Lord. ||17||
The Fourteenth Day: One who enters into the fourth state,
overcomes time, and the three qualities of raajas, taamas and satva.
Then the sun enters into the house of the moon,
and one knows the value of the technology of Yoga.
He remains lovingly focused on God, who is permeating the fourteen worlds, the nether regions of the underworld, the galaxies and solar systems. ||18||
Amaavas - The Night of the New Moon: The moon is hidden in the sky.
O wise one, understand and contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
The moon in the sky illuminates the three worlds.
Creating the creation, the Creator beholds it.
One who sees, through the Guru, merges into Him.
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded, coming and going in reincarnation. ||19||
One who establishes his home within his own heart, obtains the most beautiful, permanent place.
One comes to understand his own self, when he finds the True Guru.
Wherever there is hope, there is destruction and desolation.
The bowl of duality and selfishness breaks.
Prays Nanak, I am the slave of that one, who remains detached amidst the traps of attachment. ||20||1||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 047

Bilaaval, Third Mehl, The Seven Days, Tenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Sunday: He, the Lord, is the Primal Being.
He Himself is the Pervading Lord; there is no other at all.
Through and through, He is woven into the fabric of the world.
Whatever the Creator Himself does, that alone happens.
Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is forever in peace.
But how rare is the one, who, as Gurmukh, understands this. ||1||
Within my heart, I chant the Chant of the Lord, the treasure of virtue.
The Lord, my Lord and Master, is inaccessible, unfathomable and unlimited. Grasping the feet of the Lord's humble servants, I meditate on Him, and become the slave of His slaves. ||1||Pause||

His value cannot be described.
Talking and speaking about Him, all keep themselves lovingly focused on Him.

The profit of the Naam is obtained through the Door of the Guru.
The Great Giver Himself gives it.
I am a sacrifice to the One who gives it.
By Guru's Grace, self-conceit is eradicated.
O Nanak, enshrine the Naam within your heart.
I celebrate the victory of the Lord, the Great Giver. ||5||
Thursday: The fifty-two warriors were deluded by doubt.
All the goblins and demons are attached to duality.
God Himself created them, and sees each one distinct.
O Creator Lord, You are the Support of all.
The beings and creatures are under Your protection.
He alone meets You, whom You Yourself meet. ||6||
Friday: God is permeating and pervading everywhere.
He Himself created all, and appraises the value of all.
One who become Gurmukh, contemplates the Lord.
He practices truth and self-restraint.
Without genuine understanding, all fasts, religious rituals and daily worship services lead only to the love of duality. ||7||
Saturday: Contemplating good omens and the Shaastras,
in egotism and self-conceit, the world wanders in delusion.
The blind, self-willed manmukh in engrossed in the love of duality.
Bound and gagged at death's door, he is beaten and punished.
By Guru's Grace, one finds lasting peace.
He practices Truth, and lovingly focuses on the Truth. ||8||
Those who serve the True Guru are very fortunate.
Conquering their ego, they embrace love for the True Lord.
They are automatically imbued with Your Love, O Lord.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 048

You are the Giver of peace; You merge them into Yourself.
Everything comes from the One and only Lord; there is no other at all.
The Gurmukh realizes this, and understands. ||9||
The fifteen lunar days, the seven days of the week,
the months, seasons, days and nights, come over and over again;
so the world goes on.
Coming and going were created by the Creator Lord.
The True Lord remains steady and stable, by His almighty power.
O Nanak, how rare is that Gurmukh who understands, and contemplates the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||1||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
The Primal Lord Himself formed the Universe.
The beings and creatures are engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya.
In the love of duality, they are attached to the illusory material world.
The unfortunate ones die, and continue to come and go.
Meeting with the True Guru, understanding is obtained.
Then, the illusion of the material world is shattered, and one merges in Truth. ||1||
One who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead
\- the One God abides within his mind. ||1||Pause||
He created the Universe, and He Himself beholds all.
No one can erase Your record, Lord.
If someone calls himself a Siddha or a seeker,
he is deluded by doubt, and will continue coming and going.
That humble being alone understands, who serves the True Guru.
Conquering his ego, he finds the Lord's Door. ||2||
From the One Lord, all others were formed.
The One Lord is pervading everywhere; there is no other at all.
Renouncing duality, one comes to know the One Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one knows the Lord's Door, and His Banner.
Meeting the True Guru, one finds the One Lord.
Duality is subdued within. ||3||
One who belongs to the All-powerful Lord and Master
\- no one can destroy him.
The Lord's servant remains under His protection;
The Lord Himself forgives him, and blesses him with glorious greatness.
There is none higher than Him.
Why should he be afraid? What should he ever fear? ||4||
Through the Guru's Teachings, peace and tranquility abide within the body.
Remember the Word of the Shabad, and you shall never suffer pain.
You shall not have to come or go, or suffer in sorrow.
Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you shall merge in celestial peace.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh beholds Him ever-present, close at hand.
My God is always fully pervading everywhere. ||5||
Some are selfless servants, while others wander, deluded by doubt.
The Lord Himself does, and causes everything to be done.
The One Lord is all-pervading; there is no other at all.
The mortal might complain, if there were any other.
Serve the True Guru; this is the most excellent action.
In the Court of the True Lord, you shall be judged true. ||6||
All the lunar days, and the days of the week are beautiful, when one contemplates the Shabad.
If one serves the True Guru, he obtains the fruits of his rewards.
The omens and days all come and go.
But the Word of the Guru's Shabad is eternal and unchanging. Through it, one merges in the True Lord.
The days are auspicious, when one is imbued with Truth.
Without the Name, all the false ones wander deluded. ||7||
The self-willed manmukhs die, and dead, they fall into the most evil state.
They do not remember the One Lord; they are deluded by duality.
The human body is unconscious, ignorant and blind.
Without the Word of the Shabad, how can anyone cross over?
The Creator Himself creates.
He Himself contemplates the Guru's Word. ||8||
The religious fanatics wear all sorts of religious robes.
They roll around and wander around, like the false dice on the board.
They find no peace, here or hereafter.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 049

The self-willed manmukhs waste away their lives, and die.
Serving the True Guru, doubt is driven away.
Deep within the home of the heart, one finds the Mansion of the True Lord's Presence. ||9||
Whatever the Perfect Lord does, that alone happens.
Concern with these omens and days leads only to duality.
Without the True Guru, there is only pitch darkness.
Only idiots and fools worry about these omens and days.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh obtains understanding and realization;
he remains forever merged in the Name of the One Lord. ||10||2||
Bilaaval, First Mehl, Chhant, Dakhnee:

With her palms pressed together, she prays to the Guru, to unite her with her True Beloved Lord.
Seeing His bride's loving devotion, the Beloved Lord eradicates unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger.

I am enticed by the love of my Husband Lord, the Eternal, Imperishable Lord God.
The Lord is everlasting, the Master of masters. Whatever He wills, happens.
O Great Giver, You are always kind and compassionate. You infuse life into all living beings.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 050

I have no other spiritual wisdom, meditation or worship; the Name of the Lord alone dwells deep within me.
I know nothing about religious robes, pilgrimages or stubborn fanaticism; O Nanak, I hold tight to the Truth. ||1||

Awake, O bride of splendored eyes, and chant the Word of the Guru's Bani.
Listen, and place your faith in the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.
The Unspoken Speech, the state of Nirvaanaa - how rare is the Gurmukh who understands this.
Merging in the Word of the Shabad, self-conceit is eradicated, and the three worlds are revealed to her understanding.
Remaining detached, with infinity infusing, the true mind cherishes the virtues of the Lord.
He is fully pervading and permeating all places; Nanak has enshrined Him within his heart. ||3||
The Lord is calling you to the Mansion of His Presence; O soul-bride, He is the Lover of His devotees.
Following the Guru's Teachings, your mind shall be delighted, and your body shall be fulfilled.
Conquer and subdue your mind, and love the Word of the Shabad; reform yourself, and realize the Lord of the three worlds.
Her mind shall not waver or wander anywhere else, when she comes to know her Husband Lord.
You are my only Support, You are my Lord and Master. You are my strength and anchor.

Very fortunate are those happy soul-brides, who have the jewel of the Naam upon their foreheads.
The Lord, the Lord God, is Nanak's Husband Lord, pleasing to his mind. ||1||
The Lord is the honor of the dishonored. The Lord, the Lord God is Himself by Himself.

My Lord God does whatever He pleases; the Lord imbues mortal beings with the color of His Love.
Servant Nanak is easily merged into the Celestial Lord. He is satisfied with the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||
The Lord is found only through this human incarnation. This is the time to contemplate the Lord.
As Gurmukhs, the happy soul-brides meet Him, and their love for Him is abundant.
Those who have not attained human incarnation, are cursed by evil destiny.
O Lord, God, Har, Har, Har, Har, save Nanak; he is Your humble servant. ||3||
The Guru has implanted within me the Name of the Inaccessible Lord God; my mind and body are drenched with the Lord's Love.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 051

The Name of the Lord is the Lover of His devotees; the Gurmukhs attain the Lord.

Day and night, I stand and serve my God; how can I attain Him?
Prays Nanak, have mercy on me, and attach me to the hem of Your robe, O Lord. ||1||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 052

The date for my wedding is set, and cannot be changed; my union with the Lord is perfect.
I am totally at peace, and my separation from Him has ended.
The Saints meet and come together, and meditate on God; they form a wondrous wedding party.
Gathering together, they arrive with poise and grace, and love fills the minds of the bride's family.
Her light blends with His Light, through and through, and everyone enjoys the Nectar of the Lord's Name.
Prays Nanak, the Saints have totally united me with God, the All-powerful Cause of causes. ||3||

Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
By blessed destiny, I have found my Husband Lord.
The unstruck sound current vibrates and resounds in the Court of the Lord.
Night and day, the sounds of ecstasy resound and resonate; day and night, I am enraptured.
Disease, sorrow and suffering do not afflict anyone there; there is no birth or death there.
There are treasures overflowing there - wealth, miraculous powers, ambrosial nectar and devotional worship.
Prays Nanak, I am a sacrifice, devoted to the Supreme Lord God, the Support of the breath of life. ||1||
Listen, O my companions, and sister soul-brides, let's join together and sing the songs of joy.
Loving our God with mind and body, let's ravish and enjoy Him.
Lovingly enjoying Him, we become pleasing to Him; let's not reject Him, for a moment, even for an instant.
Let's hug Him close in our embrace, and not feel shy; let's bathe our minds in the dust of His feet.
With the intoxicating drug of devotional worship, let's entice Him, and not wander anywhere else.
Prays Nanak, meeting with our True Friend, we attain the immortal status. ||2||
I am wonder-struck and amazed, gazing upon the Glories of my Imperishable Lord.

The soul is the Creator of the expanse of creation. Without God, I know no other at all.
He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. He created the Creation.
Prays Nanak, they alone know this, who drink in the subtle essence of the Lord. ||4||2||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 053

Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Chhant:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Come, O my sisters, come, O my companions, and let us remain under the Lord's control. Let's sing the Songs of Bliss of our Husband Lord.
Renounce your pride, O my companions, renounce your egotistical pride, O my sisters, so that you may become pleasing to your Beloved.
Renounce pride, emotional attachment, corruption and duality, and serve the One Immaculate Lord.
Hold tight to the Sanctuary of the Feet of the Merciful Lord, your Beloved, the Destroyer of all sins.
Be the slave of His slaves, forsake sorrow and sadness, and do not bother with other devices.
Prays Nanak, O Lord, please bless me with Your Mercy, that I may sing Your songs of bliss. ||1||
The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of my Beloved, is like a cane to a blind man.
Maya seduces in so many ways, like a beautiful enticing woman.
This enticer is so incredibly beautiful and clever; she entices with countless suggestive gestures.
Maya is stubborn and persistent; she seems so sweet to the mind, and then he does not chant the Naam.
At home, in the forest, on the banks of sacred rivers, fasting, worshipping, on the roads and on the shore, she is spying.
Prays Nanak, please bless me with Your Kindness, Lord; I am blind, and Your Name is my cane. ||2||
I am helpless and masterless; You, O my Beloved, are my Lord and Master. As it pleases You, so do You protect me.
I have no wisdom or cleverness; what face should I put on to please You?
I am not clever, skillful or wise; I am worthless, without any virtue at all.
I have no beauty or pleasing smell, no beautiful eyes. As it pleases You, please preserve me, O Lord.
His victory is celebrated by all; how can I know the state of the Lord of Mercy?
Prays Nanak, I am the servant of Your servants; as it pleases You, please preserve me. ||3||
I am the fish, and You are the water; without You, what can I do?
I am the rainbird, and You are the rain-drop; when it falls into my mouth, I am satisfied.
When it falls into my mouth, my thirst is quenched; You are the Lord of my soul, my heart, my breath of life.
Touch me, and caress me, O Lord, You are in all; let me meet You, so that I may be emancipated.
In my consciousness I remember You, and the darkness is dispelled, like the chakvi duck, which longs to see the dawn.
Prays Nanak, O my Beloved, please unite me with Yourself; the fish never forgets the water. ||4||
Blessed, blessed is my destiny; my Husband Lord has come into my home.
The gate of my mansion is so beautiful, and all my gardens are so green and alive.
My peace-giving Lord and Master has rejuvenated me, and blessed me with great joy, bliss and love.
My Young Husband Lord is eternally young, and His body is forever youthful; what tongue can I use to chant His Glorious Praises?
My bed is beautiful; gazing upon Him, I am fascinated, and all my doubts and pains are dispelled.

Shalok:
God is beautiful, tranquil and merciful; He is the treasure of absolute peace, my Husband Lord.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 054

Meeting with God, the Ocean of Peace, O Nanak, this soul becomes happy. ||1||
Chhant:
One finds God, the Ocean of Peace, when destiny is activated.
Abandoning the distinctions of honor and dishonor, grasp the Feet of the Lord.
Renounce cleverness and trickery, and forsake your evil-minded intellect.
O Nanak, seek the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Lord, Your King, and your marriage will be permanent and stable. ||1||
Why forsake God, and attach yourself to another? Without the Lord, you cannot even live.
The ignorant fool does not feel any shame; the evil man wanders around deluded.
God is the Purifier of sinners; if he forsakes God, tell me, where he can find a place of rest?
O Nanak, by loving devotional worship of the Merciful Lord, he attains the state of eternal life. ||2||
May that vicious tongue that does not chant the Name of the Great Lord of the World, be burnt.
One who does not serve God, the Lover of His devotees, shall have his body eaten by crows.
Enticed by doubt, he does not understand the pain it brings; he wanders through millions of incarnations.
O Nanak, if you desire anything other than the Lord, you shall be consumed, like a maggot in manure. ||3||
Embrace love for the Lord God, and in detachment, unite with Him.
Give up your sandalwood oil, expensive clothes, perfumes, tasty flavors and the poison of egotism.
Do not waver this way or that, but remain wakeful in the service of the Lord.
O Nanak, she who has obtained her God, is a happy soul-bride forever. ||4||1||4||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Seek the Lord, O fortunate ones, and join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe forever, imbued with the Love of the Supreme Lord God.
Serving God forever, you shall obtain the fruitful rewards you desire.
O Nanak, seek the Sanctuary of God; meditate on the Lord, and ride the many waves of the mind. ||1||
I shall not forget God, even for an instant; He has blessed me with everything.
By great good fortune, I have met Him; as Gurmukh, I contemplate my Husband Lord.
Holding me by the arm, He has lifted me up and pulled me out of the darkness, and made me His own.
Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Nanak lives; his mind and heart are cooled and soothed. ||2||
What virtues of Yours can I speak, O God, O Searcher of hearts?
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I have crossed over to the other shore.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, all my desires are fulfilled.
Nanak is saved, meditating on the Lord, the Lord and Master of all. ||3||
Sublime are those eyes, which are drenched with the Love of the Lord.
Gazing upon God, my desires are fulfilled; I have met the Lord, the Friend of my soul.
I have obtained the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Love, and now the taste of corruption is insipid and tasteless to me.
O Nanak, as water mingles with water, my light has merged into the Light. ||4||2||5||9||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 055

Vaar Of Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
I sing of the sublime Lord, the Lord God, in the melody of Raag Bilaaval.
Hearing the Guru's Teachings, I obey them; this is the pre-ordained destiny written upon my forehead.
All day and night, I chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har; within my heart, I am lovingly attuned to Him.
My body and mind are totally rejuvenated, and the garden of my mind has blossomed forth in lush abundance.
The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled, with the light of the lamp of the Guru's wisdom. Servant Nanak lives by beholding the Lord.
Let me behold Your face, for a moment, even an instant! ||1||
Third Mehl:
Be happy and sing in Bilaaval, when the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is in your mouth.
The melody and music, and the Word of the Shabad are beautiful, when one focuses his meditation on the celestial Lord.
So leave behind the melody and music, and serve the Lord; then, you shall obtain honor in the Court of the Lord.
O Nanak, as Gurmukh, contemplate God, and rid your mind of egotistical pride. ||2||
Pauree:
O Lord God, You Yourself are inaccessible; You formed everything.
You Yourself are totally permeating and pervading the entire universe.
You Yourself are absorbed in the state of deep meditation; You Yourself sing Your Glorious Praises.
Meditate on the Lord, O devotees, day and night; He shall deliver you in the end.
Those who serve the Lord, find peace; they are absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
In the love of duality, the happiness of Bilaaval does not come; the self-willed manmukh finds no place of rest.
Through hypocrisy, devotional worship does not come, and the Supreme Lord God is not found.
By stubborn-mindedly performing religious rituals, no one obtains the approval of the Lord.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands himself, and eradicates self-conceit from within.
He Himself is the Supreme Lord God; the Supreme Lord God comes to dwell in his mind.
Birth and death are erased, and his light blends with the Light. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Be happy in Bilaaval, O my beloveds, and embrace love for the One Lord.
The pains of birth and death shall be eradicated, and you shall remain absorbed in the True Lord.
You shall be blissful forever in Bilaaval, if you walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
Sitting in the Saints' Congregation, sing with love the Glorious Praises of the Lord forever.
O Nanak, beautiful are those humble beings, who, as Gurmukh, are united in the Lord's Union. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord Himself is within all beings. The Lord is the friend of His devotees.
Everyone is under the Lord's control; in the home of the devotees there is bliss.
The Lord is the friend and companion of His devotees; all His humble servants stretch out and sleep in peace.
The Lord is the Lord and Master of all; O humble devotee, remember Him.
No one can equal You, Lord. Those who try, struggle and die in frustration. ||2||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 056

Shalok, Third Mehl:
He alone knows God, and he alone is a Brahmin, who walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
One whose heart is filled with the Lord, is freed of egotism and disease.
He chants the Lord's Praises, gathers virtue, and his light merges into the Light.
How rare are those Brahmins who, in this age, come to know God, by lovingly focusing their consciousness on Him.
O Nanak, those who are blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace, remain lovingly attuned to the Name of the True Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
One who does not serve the True Guru, and who does not love the Word of the Shabad,
earns the very painful disease of egotism; he is so very selfish.
Acting stubborn-mindedly, he is reincarnated over and over again.
The birth of the Gurmukh is fruitful and auspicious. The Lord unites him with Himself.
O Nanak, when the Merciful Lord grants His Mercy, one obtains the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
All glorious greatness is in the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh, meditate on the Lord.
One obtains all that he asks for, if he keeps his consciousness focused on the Lord.
If he tells the secrets of his soul to the True Guru, then he finds absolute peace.
When the Perfect Guru bestows the Lord's Teachings, then all hunger departs.
One who is blessed with such pre-ordained destiny, sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
No one goes away empty-handed from the True Guru; He unites me in Union with my God.
Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the True Guru; through it, one obtains whatever fruitful rewards he desires.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is Ambrosial Nectar. It banishes all hunger and thirst.
Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord brings contentment; the True Lord comes to dwell in the mind.
Meditating on the True Lord, the status of immortality is obtained; the Unstruck Word of the Shabad vibrates and resounds.
The True Lord is pervading in the ten directions; through the Guru, this is intuitively known.
O Nanak, those humble beings who have the Truth deep within, are never hidden, even if others try to hide them. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Serving the Guru, one finds the Lord, when the Lord blesses him with His Glance of Grace.
Human beings become angels, when the Lord blesses them with true devotional worship.
Conquering egotism, they are blended with the Lord; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they are purified.
O Nanak, they remain merged with the Lord; they are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam. ||2||
Pauree:
Within the Guru, the True Guru, is the glorious greatness of the Name. The Creator Lord Himself has magnified it.
All His servants and Sikhs live by gazing, gazing upon it. It is pleasing to their hearts deep within.
The slanderers and evil-doers cannot see this glorious greatness; they do not appreciate the goodness of others.
What can be achieved by anyone babbling? The Guru is in love with the True Lord.
That which is pleasing to the Creator Lord, increases day by day, while all the people babble uselessly. ||4||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Cursed are the hopes in the love of duality; they tie the consciousness to love and attachment to Maya.
One who forsakes the peace of the Lord in exchange for straw, and forgets the Naam, suffers in pain.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 057

The ignorant self-willed manmukhs are blind. They are born, only to die again, and continue coming and going.
Their affairs are not resolved, and in the end, they depart, regretting and repenting.
One who is blessed with the Lord's Grace, meets the True Guru; he alone meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Imbued with the Naam, the humble servants of the Lord find a lasting peace; servant Nanak is a sacrifice to them. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Hope and desire entice the world; they entice the whole universe.
Everyone, and all that has been created, is under the domination of Death.
By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, Death seizes the mortal; he alone is saved, whom the Creator Lord forgives.
O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, this mortal swims across, if he abandons his ego.
Conquer hope and desire, and remain unattached; contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
Pauree:
Wherever I go in this world, I see the Lord there.
In the world hereafter as well, the Lord, the True Judge Himself, is pervading and permeating everywhere.
The faces of the false are cursed, while the true devotees are blessed with glorious greatness.
True is the Lord and Master, and true is His justice. The heads of the slanderers are covered with ashes.
Servant Nanak worships the True Lord in adoration; as Gurmukh, he finds peace. ||5||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
By perfect destiny, one finds the True Guru, if the Lord God grants forgiveness.
Of all efforts, the best effort is to attain the Lord's Name.
It brings a cooling, soothing tranquility deep within the heart, and eternal peace.
Then, one eats and wears the Ambrosial Nectar; O Nanak, through the Name, comes glorious greatness. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O mind, listening to the Guru's Teachings, you shall obtain the treasure of virtue.
The Giver of peace shall dwell in your mind; you shall be rid of egotism and pride.
O Nanak, by His Grace, one is blessed with the Ambrosial Nectar of the treasure of virtue. ||2||
Pauree:
The kings, emperors, rulers, lords, nobles and chiefs, are all created by the Lord.
Whatever the Lord causes them to do, they do; they are all beggars, dependent on the Lord.
Such is God, the Lord of all; He is on the True Guru's side. All castes and social classes, the four sources of creation, and the whole universe are slaves of the True Guru; God makes them work for Him.
See the glorious greatness of serving the Lord, O Saints of the Lord; He has conquered and driven all the enemies and evil-doers out of the body-village.
The Lord, Har, Har, is Merciful to His humble devotees; granting His Grace, the Lord Himself protects and preserves them. ||6||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Fraud and hypocrisy within bring constant pain; the self-willed manmukh does not practice meditation.
Suffering in pain, he does his deeds; he is immersed in pain, and he shall suffer in pain hereafter.
By his karma, he meets the True Guru, and then, he is lovingly attuned to the True Name.
O Nanak, he is naturally at peace; doubt and fear run away and leave him. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The Gurmukh is in love with the Lord forever. The Name of the Lord is pleasing to his mind.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 058

The Gurmukh beholds and speaks the Naam, the Name of the Lord; chanting the Naam, he finds peace.
O Nanak, the spiritual wisdom of the Gurmukh shines forth; the black darkness of ignorance is dispelled. ||2||
Third Mehl:
The filthy, foolish, self-willed manmukhs die.
The Gurmukhs are immaculate and pure; they keep the Lord enshrined within their hearts.
Prays Nanak, listen, O Siblings of Destiny!
Serve the True Guru, and the filth of your ego shall be gone.
Deep within, the pain of skepticism afflicts them; their heads are constantly assaulted by worldly entanglements.
Asleep in the love of duality, they never wake up; they are attached to the love of Maya.
They do not remember the Name, and they do not contemplate the Word of the Shabad; this is the view of the self-willed manmukhs.
They do not love the Lord's Name, and they lose their life uselessly. O Nanak, the Messenger of Death attacks them, and humiliates them. ||3||
Pauree:
He alone is a true king, whom the Lord blesses with true devotion.
People pledge their allegiance to him; no other store stocks this merchandise, nor deals in this trade.
That humble devotee who turns his face towards the Guru and becomes sunmukh, receives the Lord's wealth; the faithless baymukh, who turns his face away from the Guru, gathers only ashes.
The Lord's devotees are dealers in the Name of the Lord. The Messenger of Death, the tax-collector, does not even approach them.
Servant Nanak has loaded the wealth of the Name of the Lord, who is forever independent and care-free. ||7||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
In this age, the devotee earns the wealth of the Lord; all the rest of the world wanders deluded in doubt.
By Guru's Grace, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell in his mind; night and day, he meditates on the Naam.
In the midst of corruption, he remains detached; through the Word of the Shabad, he burns away his ego.
He crosses over, and saves his relatives as well; blessed is the mother who gave birth to him.
Peace and poise fill his mind forever, and he embraces love for the True Lord.
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva wander in the three qualities, while their egotism and desire increase.
The Pandits, the religious scholars and the silent sages read and debate in confusion; their consciousness is centered on the love of duality.
The Yogis, wandering pilgrims and Sanyaasees are deluded; without the Guru, they do not find the essence of reality.
The miserable self-willed manmukhs are forever deluded by doubt; they waste away their lives uselessly.
O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam are balanced and poised; forgiving them, the Lord blends them with Himself. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O Nanak, praise Him, who has control over everything.
Remember Him, O mortals - without Him, there is no other at all.
He dwells deep within those who are Gurmukh; forever and ever, they are at peace. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who do not become Gurmukh and earn the wealth of the Lord's Name, are bankrupt in this age.
They wander around begging all over the world, but no one even spits in their faces.
They gossip about others, and lose their credit, and expose themselves as well.
That wealth, for which they slander others, does not come into their hands, no matter where they go.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 059

Through loving service, the Gurmukhs receive the wealth of the Naam, but the unfortunate ones cannot receive it. This wealth is not found anywhere else, in this country or in any other. ||8||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukh does not have an iota of skepticism or doubt; worries depart from within him.
Whatever he does, he does with grace and poise. Nothing else can be said about him.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself hears the speech of those whom He makes His own. ||1||
Third Mehl:
He conquers death, and subdues the desires of his mind; the Immaculate Name abides deep within him.
Night and day, he remains awake and aware; he never sleeps, and he intuitively drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.
His speech is sweet, and his words are nectar; night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
He dwells in the home of his own self, and appears beautiful forever; meeting him, Nanak finds peace. ||2||
Pauree:
The wealth of the Lord is a jewel, a gem; the Guru has caused the Lord to grant that wealth of the Lord.
If someone sees something, he may ask for it; or, someone may cause it to be given to him. But no one can take a share of this wealth of the Lord by force.
He alone obtains a share of the wealth of the Lord, who is blessed by the Creator with faith and devotion to the True Guru, according to his pre-ordained destiny.
No one is a share-holder in this wealth of the Lord, and no one owns any of it. It has no boundaries or borders to be disputed. If anyone speaks ill of the wealth of the Lord, his face will be blackened in the four directions.
No one's power or slander can prevail against the gifts of the Lord; day by day they continually, continuously increase. ||9||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The world is going up in flames - shower it with Your Mercy, and save it!
Save it, and deliver it, by whatever method it takes.
The True Guru has shown the way to peace, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.
Nanak knows no other than the Lord, the Forgiving Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Through egotism, fascination with Maya has trapped them in duality.
It cannot be killed, it does not die, and it cannot be sold in a store.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is burnt away, and then it departs from within.
The body and mind become pure, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind.
O Nanak, the Shabad is the killer of Maya; the Gurmukh obtains it. ||2||
Pauree:
The glorious greatness of the True Guru was bestowed by the True Guru; He understood this as the Insignia, the Mark of the Primal Lord's Will.
He tested His sons, nephews, sons-in-law and relatives, and subdued the egotistical pride of them all.
Wherever anyone looks, my True Guru is there; the Lord blessed Him with the whole world.
One who meets with, and believes in the True Guru, is embellished here and hereafter. Whoever turns his back on the Guru and becomes baymukh, shall wander in cursed and evil places.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 060

My Lord and Master is on the side of servant Nanak. The All-powerful and All-knowing Lord God is my Best Friend.
Seeing the food being distributed, everyone came and fell at the feet of the True Guru, who cleansed the minds of all of their egotistical pride. ||10||
Shalok, First Mehl:
One plants the seed, another harvests the crop, and still another beats the grain from the chaff.
O Nanak, it is not known, who will ultimately eat the grain. ||1||
First Mehl:
He alone is carried across, within whose mind the Lord abides.
O Nanak, that alone happens, which is pleasing to His Will. ||2||
Pauree:
The Merciful Supreme Lord God has carried me across the world-ocean.
The compassionate perfect Guru has eradicated my doubts and fears.
Unsatisfied sexual desire and unresolved anger, the horrible demons, have been totally destroyed.
I have enshrined the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam within my throat and heart.
O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my birth and death have been adorned and redeemed. ||11||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are said to be false.
The five thieves plunder their homes, and egotism breaks in.
The faithless cynics are defrauded by their own evil-mindedness; they do not know the sublime essence of the Lord.
Those who lose the Ambrosial Nectar through doubt, remain engrossed and entangled in corruption.
They make friends with the wicked, and argue with the humble servants of the Lord.
O Nanak, the faithless cynics are bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death, and suffer agony in hell.
They act according to the karma of the actions they committed before; as the Lord keeps them, so do they live. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Those who serve the True Guru, are transformed from powerless into powerful.
With every breath and morsel of food, the Lord abides in their minds forever, and the Messenger of Death cannot even see them.
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, fills their hearts, and Maya is their servant.
One who becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves, obtains the greatest treasure.
O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to that one, within whose mind and body God dwells.
One who has such pre-ordained destiny, he alone is in love with the humble Saints. ||2||
Pauree:
Whatever the Perfect True Guru says, the Transcendent Lord hears.
It pervades and permeates the whole world, and it is on the mouth of each and every being.
So numerous are the great glories of the Lord, they cannot even be counted.
Truth, poise and bliss rest in the True Guru; the Guru bestows the jewel of Truth.
O Nanak, the Supreme Lord God embellishes the Saints, who become like the True Lord. ||12||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
He does not understand himself; he believes the Lord God to be far away.
He forgets to serve the Guru; how can his mind remain in the Lord's Presence?
The self-willed manmukh wastes away his life in worthless greed and falsehood.
O Nanak, the Lord forgives, and blends them with Himself; through the True Word of the Shabad, He is ever-present. ||1||
Third Mehl:
True is the Praise of the Lord God; the Gurmukh chants the Name of the Lord of the Universe.
Praising the Naam night and day, and meditating on the Lord, the mind becomes blissful.
By great good fortune, I have found the Lord, the perfect embodiment of supreme bliss.
Servant Nanak praises the Naam; his mind and body shall never again be shattered. ||2||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 061

Pauree:
If someone slanders the True Guru, and then comes seeking the Guru's Protection,
the True Guru forgives him for his past sins, and unites him with the Saints' Congregation.
When the rain falls, the water in the streams, rivers and ponds flows into the Ganges; flowing into the Ganges, it is made sacred and pure.
Such is the glorious greatness of the True Guru, who has no vengeance; meeting with Him, thirst and hunger are quenched, and instantly, one attains celestial peace.
O Nanak, behold this wonder of the Lord, my True King! Everyone is pleased with one who obeys and believes in the True Guru. ||13||1||
Sudh||
Bilaaval, The Word Of The Devotees.
Of Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified By Guru's Grace:
This world is a drama; no one can remain here.
Walk the straight path; otherwise, you will be pushed around. ||1||Pause||
The children, the young and the old, O Siblings of Destiny, will be taken away by the Messenger of Death.
The Lord has made the poor man a mouse, and the cat of Death is eating him up. ||1||
It gives no special consideration to either the rich or the poor.
The king and his subjects are equally killed; such is the power of Death. ||2||
Those who are pleasing to the Lord are the servants of the Lord; their story is unique and singular.
They do not come and go, and they never die; they remain with the Supreme Lord God. ||3||
Know this in your soul, that by renouncing your children, spouse, wealth and property
\- says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - you shall be united with the Lord of the Universe. ||4||1||
BILAAVAL:
I do not read books of knowledge, and I do not understand the debates.
I have gone insane, chanting and hearing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
O my father, I have gone insane; the whole world is sane, and I am insane.
I am spoiled; let no one else be spoiled like me. ||1||Pause||
I have not made myself go insane - the Lord made me go insane.
The True Guru has burnt away my doubt. ||2||
I am spoiled; I have lost my intellect.
Let no one go astray in doubt like me. ||3||
He alone is insane, who does not understand himself.
When he understands himself, then he knows the One Lord. ||4||
One who is not intoxicated with the Lord now, shall never be intoxicated.
Says Kabeer, I am imbued with the Lord's Love. ||5||2||
BILAAVAL:
Abandoning his household, he may go to the forest, and live by eating roots;
but even so, his sinful, evil mind does not renounce corruption. ||1||
How can anyone be saved? How can anyone cross over the terrifying world-ocean?
Save me, save me, O my Lord! Your humble servant seeks Your Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||
I cannot escape my desire for sin and corruption.
I make all sorts of efforts to hold back from this desire, but it clings to me, again and again. ||2||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 062

Youth and old age - my entire life has passed, but I haven't done any good.
This priceless soul has been treated as if if were worth no more than a shell. ||3||
Says Kabeer, O my Lord, You are contained in all.
There is none as merciful as You are, and none as sinful as I am. ||4||3||
BILAAVAL:
Every day, he rises early, and brings a fresh clay pot; he passes his life embellishing and glazing it.
He does not think at all of worldly weaving; he is absorbed in the subtle essence of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Who in our family has ever chanted the Name of the Lord?
Ever since this worthless son of mine began chanting with his mala, we have had no peace at all! ||1||Pause||
Listen, O my sisters-in-law, a wondrous thing has happened!
This boy has ruined our weaving business. Why didn't he simply die? ||2||
O mother, the One Lord, the Lord and Master, is the source of all peace. The Guru has blessed me with His Name.
He preserved the honor of Prahlaad, and destroyed Harnaakhash with his nails. ||3||
I have renounced the gods and ancestors of my house, for the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Says Kabeer, God is the Destroyer of all sins; He is the Saving Grace of His Saints. ||4||4||
BILAAVAL:
There is no king equal to the Lord.
All these lords of the world last for only a few days, putting on their false displays. ||1||Pause||
How can Your humble servant waver? You spread Your shadow over the three worlds.
Who can raise his hand against Your humble servant? No one can describe the Lord's expanse. ||1||
Remember Him, O my thoughtless and foolish mind, and the unstruck melody of the sound current will resonate and resound.
Says Kabeer, my skepticism and doubt have been dispelled; the Lord has exalted me, as He did Dhroo and Prahlaad. ||2||5||
BILAAVAL:
Save me! I have disobeyed You.
I have not practiced humility, righteousness or devotional worship; I am proud and egotistical, and I have taken a crooked path. ||1||Pause||
Believing this body to be immortal, I pampered it, but it is a fragile and perishable vessel.
Forgetting the Lord who formed, fashioned and embellished me, I have become attached to another. ||1||
I am Your thief; I cannot be called holy. I have fallen at Your feet, seeking Your Sanctuary.
Says Kabeer, please listen to this prayer of mine, O Lord; please do not send me sommons of the Messenger of Death. ||2||6||
BILAAVAL:
I stand humbly at Your Court.
Who else can take care of me, other than You? Please open Your door, and grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||Pause||
You are the richest of the rich, generous and unattached. With my ears, I listen to Your Praises.
From whom should I beg? I see that all are beggars. My salvation comes only from You. ||1||
You blessed Jai Dayv, Naam Dayv and Sudaamaa the Brahmin with Your infinite mercy.
Says Kabeer, You are the All-powerful Lord, the Great Giver; in an instant, You bestow the four great blessings. ||2||7||
BILAAVAL:
He has a walking stick, ear-rings, a patched coat and a begging bowl.
Wearing the robes of a beggar, he wanders around, deluded by doubt. ||1||

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 063

Abandon your Yogic postures and breath control exercises, O madman.
Renounce fraud and deception, and meditate continuously on the Lord, O madman. ||1||Pause||
That which you beg for, has been enjoyed in the three worlds.
Says Kabeer, the Lord is the only Yogi in the world. ||2||8||
BILAAVAL:
This Maya has made me forget Your feet, O Lord of the World, Master of the Universe.
Not even a bit of love wells up in Your humble servant; what can Your poor servant do? ||1||Pause||
Cursed is the body, cursed is the wealth, and cursed is this Maya; cursed, cursed is the clever intellect and understanding.
Restrain and hold back this Maya; overcome it, through the Word of the Guru's Teachings. ||1||
What good is farming, and what good is trading? Worldly entanglements and pride are false.
Says Kabeer, in the end, they are ruined; ultimately, Death will come for them. ||2||9||
BILAAVAL:
Within the pool of the body, there is an incomparably beautiful lotus flower.
Within it, is the Supreme Light, the Supreme Soul, who has no feature or form. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate, meditate on the Lord, and forsake your doubt. The Lord is the Life of the World. ||1||Pause||
Nothing is seen coming into the world, and nothing is seen leaving it.
Where the body is born, there it dies, like the leaves of the water-lily. ||2||
Maya is false and transitory; forsaking it, one obtains peaceful, celestial contemplation.
Says Kabeer, serve Him within your mind; He is the Enemy of ego, the Destroyer of demons. ||3||10||
BILAAVAL:
The illusion of birth and death is gone; I lovingly focus on the Lord of the Universe.
In my life, I am absorbed in deep silent meditation; the Guru's Teachings have awakened me. ||1||Pause||
The sound made from bronze, that sound goes into the bronze again.
But when the bronze is broken, O Pandit, O religious scholar, where does the sound go then? ||1||
I gaze upon the world, the confluence of the three qualities; God is awake and aware in each and every heart.
Such is the understanding revealed to me; within my heart, I have become a detached renunciate. ||2||
I have come to know my own self, and my light has merged in the Light.
Says Kabeer, now I know the Lord of the Universe, and my mind is satisfied. ||3||11||
BILAAVAL:
When Your Lotus Feet dwell within one's heart, why should that person waver, O Divine Lord?
I know that all comforts, and the nine treasures, come to one who intuitively, naturally, chants the Praise of the Divine Lord. ||Pause||
Such wisdom comes, only when one sees the Lord in all, and unties the knot of hypocrisy.
Time and time again, he must hold himself back from Maya; let him take the scale of the Lord, and weigh his mind. ||1||
Then wherever he goes, he will find peace, and Maya will not shake him.
Says Kabeer, my mind believes in the Lord; I am absorbed in the Love of the Divine Lord. ||2||12||
Bilaaval, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Guru has made my life fruitful.

## Section 20 - Raag Bilaaval - Part 064

My pain is forgotten, and I have found peace deep within myself. ||1||
The Guru has blessed me with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.
Without the Lord's Name, life is mindless. ||1||Pause||
Meditating in remembrance, Naam Dayv has come to know the Lord.
His soul is blended with the Lord, the Life of the World. ||2||1||
Bilaaval, The Word Of Devotee Ravi Daas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Seeing my poverty, everyone laughed. Such was my condition.
Now, I hold the eighteen miraculous spiritual powers in the palm of my hand; everything is by Your Grace. ||1||
You know, and I am nothing, O Lord, Destroyer of fear.
All beings seek Your Sanctuary, O God, Fulfiller, Resolver of our affairs. ||1||Pause||
Whoever enters Your Sanctuary, is relieved of his burden of sin.
You have saved the high and the low from the shameless world. ||2||
Says Ravi Daas, what more can be said about the Unspoken Speech?
Whatever You are, You are, O Lord; how can anything compare with Your Praises? ||3||1||
BILAAVAL:
That family, into which a holy person is born,
whether of high or low social class, whether rich or poor, shall have its pure fragrance spread all over the world. ||1||Pause||
Whether he is a Brahmin, a Vaishya, a Soodra, or a Kh'shaatriya; whether he is a poet, an outcaste, or a filthy-minded person,
he becomes pure, by meditating on the Lord God. He saves himself, and the families of both his parents. ||1||
Blessed is that village, and blessed is the place of his birth; blessed is his pure family, throughout all the worlds.
One who drinks in the sublime essence abandons other tastes; intoxicated with this divine essence, he discards sin and corruption. ||2||
Among the religious scholars, warriors and kings, there is no other equal to the Lord's devotee.
As the leaves of the water lily float free in the water, says Ravi Daas, so is their life in the world. ||3||2||
The Word Of Sadhana, Raag Bilaaval:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
For a king's daughter, a man disguised himself as Vishnu.
He did it for sexual exploitation, and for selfish motives, but the Lord protected his honor. ||1||
What is Your value, O Guru of the world, if You will not erase the karma of my past actions?
Why seek safety from a lion, if one is to be eaten by a jackal? ||1||Pause||
For the sake of a single rain-drop, the rainbird suffers in pain.
When its breath of life is gone, even an ocean is of no use to it. ||2||
Now, my life has grown weary, and I shall not last much longer; how can I be patient?
If I drown and die, and then a boat comes along, tell me, how shall I climb aboard? ||3||
I am nothing, I have nothing, and nothing belongs to me.
Now, protect my honor; Sadhana is Your humble servant. ||4||1||
