## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 001

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Siree Raag, First Mehl, First House:
If I had a palace made of pearls, inlaid with jewels,
scented with musk, saffron and sandalwood, a sheer delight to behold
\-seeing this, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||1||
Without the Lord, my soul is scorched and burnt.
I consulted my Guru, and now I see that there is no other place at all. ||1||Pause||
If the floor of this palace was a mosaic of diamonds and rubies, and if my bed was encased with rubies,
and if heavenly beauties, their faces adorned with emeralds, tried to entice me with sensual gestures of love
\-seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||2||
If I were to become a Siddha, and work miracles, summon wealth
and become invisible and visible at will, so that people would hold me in awe
\-seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||3||
If I were to become an emperor and raise a huge army, and sit on a throne,
issuing commands and collecting taxes-O Nanak, all of this could pass away like a puff of wind.
Seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||4||1||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
If I could live for millions and millions of years, and if the air was my food and drink,
and if I lived in a cave and never saw either the sun or the moon, and if I never slept, even in dreams
\-even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||1||
The True Lord, the Formless One, is Himself in His Own Place.
I have heard, over and over again, and so I tell the tale; as it pleases You, Lord, please instill within me the yearning for You. ||1||Pause||
If I was slashed and cut into pieces, over and over again, and put into the mill and ground into flour,
burnt by fire and mixed with ashes
\-even then, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||2||
If I was a bird, soaring and flying through hundreds of heavens,
and if I was invisible, neither eating nor drinking anything
\-even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||3||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 002

O Nanak, if I had hundreds of thousands of stacks of paper, and if I were to read and recite and embrace love for the Lord,
and if ink were never to fail me, and if my pen were able to move like the wind
\-even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||4||2||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
As it is pre-ordained, people speak their words. As it is pre-ordained, they consume their food.
As it is pre-ordained, they walk along the way. As it is pre-ordained, they see and hear.
As it is pre-ordained, they draw their breath. Why should I go and ask the scholars about this? ||1||
O Baba, the splendor of Maya is deceptive.
The blind man has forgotten the Name; he is in limbo, neither here nor there. ||1||Pause||
Life and death come to all who are born. Everything here gets devoured by Death.
He sits and examines the accounts, there where no one goes along with anyone.
Those who weep and wail might just as well all tie bundles of straw. ||2||
Everyone says that God is the Greatest of the Great. No one calls Him any less.
No one can estimate His Worth. By speaking of Him, His Greatness is not increased.
You are the One True Lord and Master of all the other beings, of so many worlds. ||3||
Nanak seeks the company of the lowest of the low class, the very lowest of the low. Why should he try to compete with the great?
In that place where the lowly are cared for-there, the Blessings of Your Glance of Grace rain down. ||4||3||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Greed is a dog; falsehood is a filthy street-sweeper. Cheating is eating a rotting carcass.
Slandering others is putting the filth of others into your own mouth. The fire of anger is the outcaste who burns dead bodies at the crematorium.
I am caught in these tastes and flavors, and in self-conceited praise. These are my actions, O my Creator! ||1||
O Baba, speak only that which will bring you honor.
They alone are good, who are judged good at the Lord's Door. Those with bad karma can only sit and weep. ||1||Pause||
The pleasures of gold and silver, the pleasures of women, the pleasure of the fragrance of sandalwood,
the pleasure of horses, the pleasure of a soft bed in a palace, the pleasure of sweet treats and the pleasure of hearty meals
\-these pleasures of the human body are so numerous; how can the Naam, the Name of the Lord, find its dwelling in the heart? ||2||
Those words are acceptable, which, when spoken, bring honor.
Harsh words bring only grief. Listen, O foolish and ignorant mind!
Those who are pleasing to Him are good. What else is there to be said? ||3||
Wisdom, honor and wealth are in the laps of those whose hearts remain permeated with the Lord.
What praise can be offered to them? What other adornments can be bestowed upon them?
O Nanak, those who lack the Lord's Glance of Grace cherish neither charity nor the Lord's Name. ||4||4||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The Great Giver has given the intoxicating drug of falsehood.
The people are intoxicated; they have forgotten death, and they have fun for a few days.
Those who do not use intoxicants are true; they dwell in the Court of the Lord. ||1||
O Nanak, know the True Lord as True.
Serving Him, peace is obtained; you shall go to His Court with honor. ||1||Pause||
The Wine of Truth is not fermented from molasses. The True Name is contained within it.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 003

I am a sacrifice to those who hear and chant the True Name.
Only one who obtains a room in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is deemed to be truly intoxicated. ||2||
Bathe in the waters of Goodness and apply the scented oil of Truth to your body,
and your face shall become radiant. This is the gift of 100,000 gifts.
Tell your troubles to the One who is the Source of all comfort. ||3||
How can you forget the One who created your soul, and the praanaa, the breath of life?
Without Him, all that we wear and eat is impure.
Everything else is false. Whatever pleases Your Will is acceptable. ||4||5||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Burn emotional attachment, and grind it into ink. Transform your intelligence into the purest of paper.
Make the love of the Lord your pen, and let your consciousness be the scribe. Then, seek the Guru's Instructions, and record these deliberations.
Write the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; write over and over again that He has no end or limitation. ||1||
O Baba, write such an account,
that when it is asked for, it will bring the Mark of Truth. ||1||Pause||
There, where greatness, eternal peace and everlasting joy are bestowed,
the faces of those whose minds are attuned to the True Name are anointed with the Mark of Grace.
If one receives God's Grace, then such honors are received, and not by mere words. ||2||
Some come, and some arise and depart. They give themselves lofty names.
Some are born beggars, and some hold vast courts.
Going to the world hereafter, everyone shall realize that without the Name, it is all useless. ||3||
I am terrified by the Fear of You, God. Bothered and bewildered, my body is wasting away.
Those who are known as sultans and emperors shall be reduced to dust in the end.
O Nanak, arising and departing, all false attachments are cut away. ||4||6||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Believing, all tastes are sweet. Hearing, the salty flavors are tasted;
chanting with one's mouth, the spicy flavors are savored. All these spices have been made from the Sound-current of the Naad.
The thirty-six flavors of ambrosial nectar are in the Love of the One Lord; they are tasted only by one who is blessed by His Glance of Grace. ||1||
O Baba, the pleasures of other foods are false.
Eating them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||
My mind is imbued with the Lord's Love; it is dyed a deep crimson. Truth and charity are my white clothes.
The blackness of sin is erased by my wearing of blue clothes, and meditation on the Lord's Lotus Feet is my robe of honor.
Contentment is my cummerbund, Your Name is my wealth and youth. ||2||
O Baba, the pleasures of other clothes are false.
Wearing them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||
The understanding of Your Way, Lord, is horses, saddles and bags of gold for me.
The pursuit of virtue is my bow and arrow, my quiver, sword and scabbard.
To be distinguished with honor is my drum and banner. Your Mercy is my social status. ||3||
O Baba, the pleasures of other rides are false.
By such rides, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the pleasure of houses and mansions. Your Glance of Grace is my family, Lord.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 004

The Hukam of Your Command is the pleasure of Your Will, Lord. To say anything else is far beyond anyone's reach.
O Nanak, the True King does not seek advice from anyone else in His decisions. ||4||
O Baba, the pleasure of other sleep is false.
By such sleep, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||4||7||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
With the body of saffron, and the tongue a jewel, and the breath of the body pure fragrant incense;
with the face anointed at the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, and the heart illuminated with wisdom
\-with that wisdom, chant the Praises of the True Name, the Treasure of Excellence. ||1||
O Baba, other wisdom is useless and irrelevant.
If falsehood is practiced a hundred times, it is still false in its effects. ||1||Pause||
You may be worshipped and adored as a Pir (a spiritual teacher); you may be welcomed by all the world;
you may adopt a lofty name, and be known to have supernatural spiritual powers
\-even so, if you are not accepted in the Court of the Lord, then all this adoration is false. ||2||
No one can overthrow those who have been established by the True Guru.
The Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within them, and through the Naam, they are radiant and famous.
They worship the Naam, and they believe in the Naam. The True One is forever Intact and Unbroken. ||3||
When the body mingles with dust, what happens to the soul?
All clever tricks are burnt away, and you shall depart crying.
O Nanak, those who forget the Naam-what will happen when they go to the Court of the Lord? ||4||8||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The virtuous wife exudes virtue; the unvirtuous suffer in misery.
If you long for your Husband Lord, O soul-bride, you must know that He is not met by falsehood.
No boat or raft can take you to Him. Your Husband Lord is far away. ||1||
My Lord and Master is Perfect; His Throne is Eternal and Immovable.
One who attains perfection as Gurmukh, obtains the Immeasurable True Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Palace of the Lord God is so beautiful. Within it, there are gems, rubies, pearls and flawless diamonds. A fortress of gold surrounds this Source of Nectar.
How can I climb up to the Fortress without a ladder? By meditating on the Lord, through the Guru, I am blessed and exalted. ||2||
The Guru is the Ladder, the Guru is the Boat, and the Guru is the Raft to take me to the Lord's Name.
The Guru is the Boat to carry me across the world-ocean; the Guru is the Sacred Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Holy River.
If it pleases Him, I bathe in the Pool of Truth, and become radiant and pure. ||3||
He is called the Most Perfect of the Perfect. He sits upon His Perfect Throne.
He looks so Beautiful in His Perfect Place. He fulfills the hopes of the hopeless.
O Nanak, if one obtains the Perfect Lord, how can his virtues decrease? ||4||9||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Come, my dear sisters and spiritual companions; hug me close in your embrace.
Let's join together, and tell stories of our All-powerful Husband Lord.
All Virtues are in our True Lord and Master; we are utterly without virtue. ||1||
O Creator Lord, all are in Your Power.
I dwell upon the One Word of the Shabad. You are mine-what else do I need? ||1||Pause||
Go, and ask the happy soul-brides, “By what virtuous qualities do you enjoy your Husband Lord?”
“We are adorned with intuitive ease, contentment and sweet words.
We meet with our Beloved, the Source of Joy, when we listen to the Word of the Guru's Shabad."||2||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 005

You have so many Creative Powers, Lord; Your Bountiful Blessings are so Great.
So many of Your beings and creatures praise You day and night.
You have so many forms and colors, so many classes, high and low. ||3||
Meeting the True One, Truth wells up. The truthful are absorbed into the True Lord.
Intuitive understanding is obtained and one is welcomed with honor, through the Guru's Word, filled with the Fear of God.
O Nanak, the True King absorbs us into Himself. ||4||10||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
It all worked out-I was saved, and the egotism within my heart was subdued.
The evil energies have been made to serve me, since I placed my faith in the True Guru.
I have renounced my useless schemes, by the Grace of the True, Carefree Lord. ||1||
O mind, meeting with the True One, fear departs.
Without the Fear of God, how can anyone become fearless? Become Gurmukh, and immerse yourself in the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
How can we describe Him with words? There is no end to the descriptions of Him.
There are so many beggars, but He is the only Giver.
He is the Giver of the soul, and the praanaa, the breath of life; when He dwells within the mind, there is peace. ||2||
The world is a drama, staged in a dream. In a moment, the play is played out.
Some attain union with the Lord, while others depart in separation.
Whatever pleases Him comes to pass; nothing else can be done. ||3||
The Gurmukhs purchase the Genuine Article. The True Merchandise is purchased with the True Capital.
Those who purchase this True Merchandise through the Perfect Guru are blessed.
O Nanak, one who stocks this True Merchandise shall recognize and realize the Genuine Article. ||4||11||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
As metal merges with metal, those who chant the Praises of the Lord are absorbed into the Praiseworthy Lord.
Like the poppies, they are dyed in the deep crimson color of Truthfulness.
Those contented souls who meditate on the Lord with single-minded love, meet the True Lord. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, become the dust of the feet of the humble Saints.
In the Society of the Saints, the Guru is found. He is the Treasure of Liberation, the Source of all good fortune. ||1||Pause||
Upon that Highest Plane of Sublime Beauty, stands the Mansion of the Lord.
By true actions, this human body is obtained, and the door within ourselves which leads to the Mansion of the Beloved, is found.
The Gurmukhs train their minds to contemplate the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||2||
By actions committed under the influence of the three qualities, hope and anxiety are produced.
Without the Guru, how can anyone be released from these three qualities? Through intuitive wisdom, we meet with Him and find peace.
Within the home of the self, the Mansion of His Presence is realized when He bestows His Glance of Grace and washes away our pollution. ||3||
Without the Guru, this pollution is not removed. Without the Lord, how can there be any homecoming?
Contemplate the One Word of the Shabad, and abandon other hopes.
O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to the one who beholds, and inspires others to behold Him. ||4||12||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The life of the discarded bride is cursed. She is deceived by the love of duality.
Like a wall of sand, day and night, she crumbles, and eventually, she breaks down altogether.
Without the Word of the Shabad, peace does not come. Without her Husband Lord, her suffering does not end. ||1||
O soul-bride, without your Husband Lord, what good are your decorations?

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 006

In this world, you shall not find any shelter; in the world hereafter, being false, you shall suffer. ||1||Pause||
The True Lord Himself knows all; He makes no mistakes. He is the Great Farmer of the Universe.
First, He prepares the ground, and then He plants the Seed of the True Name.
The nine treasures are produced from Name of the One Lord. By His Grace, we obtain His Banner and Insignia. ||2||
Some are very knowledgeable, but if they do not know the Guru, then what is the use of their lives?
The blind have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The self-willed manmukhs are in utter darkness.
Their comings and goings in reincarnation do not end; through death and rebirth, they are wasting away. ||3||
The bride may buy sandalwood oil and perfumes, and apply them in great quantities to her hair;
she may sweeten her breath with betel leaf and camphor,
but if this bride is not pleasing to her Husband Lord, then all these trappings are false. ||4||
Her enjoyment of all pleasures is futile, and all her decorations are corrupt.
Until she has been pierced through with the Shabad, how can she look beautiful at Guru's Gate?
O Nanak, blessed is that fortunate bride, who is in love with her Husband Lord. ||5||13||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The empty body is dreadful, when the soul goes out from within.
The burning fire of life is extinguished, and the smoke of the breath no longer emerges.
The five relatives (the senses) weep and wail painfully, and waste away through the love of duality. ||1||
You fool: chant the Name of the Lord, and preserve your virtue.
Egotism and possessiveness are very enticing; egotistical pride has plundered everyone. ||1||Pause||
Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are attached to affairs of duality.
Attached to duality, they putrefy and die; they are filled with the fire of desire within.
Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; all others are cheated and plundered by deceitful worldly affairs. ||2||
Love dies, and affection vanishes. Hatred and alienation die.
Entanglements end, and egotism dies, along with attachment to Maya, possessiveness and anger.
Those who receive His Mercy obtain the True One. The Gurmukhs dwell forever in balanced restraint. ||3||
By true actions, the True Lord is met, and the Guru's Teachings are found.
Then, they are not subject to birth and death; they do not come and go in reincarnation.
O Nanak, they are respected at the Lord's Gate; they are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||14||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The body is burnt to ashes; by its love of Maya, the mind is rusted through.
Demerits become one's enemies, and falsehood blows the bugle of attack.
Without the Word of the Shabad, people wander lost in reincarnation. Through the love of duality, multitudes have been drowned. ||1||
O mind, swim across, by focusing your consciousness on the Shabad.
Those who do not become Gurmukh do not understand the Naam; they die, and continue coming and going in reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
That body is said to be pure, in which the True Name abides.
One whose body is imbued with the Fear of the True One, and whose tongue savors Truthfulness,
is brought to ecstasy by the True Lord's Glance of Grace. That person does not have to go through the fire of the womb again. ||2||
From the True Lord came the air, and from the air came water.
From water, He created the three worlds; in each and every heart He has infused His Light.
The Immaculate Lord does not become polluted. Attuned to the Shabad, honor is obtained. ||3||
One whose mind is contented with Truthfulness, is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 007

The body of the five elements is dyed in the Fear of the True One; the mind is filled with the True Light.
O Nanak, your demerits shall be forgotten; the Guru shall preserve your honor. ||4||15||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
O Nanak, the Boat of Truth will ferry you across; contemplate the Guru.
Some come, and some go; they are totally filled with egotism.
Through stubborn-mindedness, the intellect is drowned; one who becomes Gurmukh and truthful is saved. ||1||
Without the Guru, how can anyone swim across to find peace?
As it pleases You, Lord, You save me. There is no other for me at all. ||1||Pause||
In front of me, I see the jungle burning; behind me, I see green plants sprouting.
We shall merge into the One from whom we came. The True One is pervading each and every heart.
He Himself unites us in Union with Himself; the True Mansion of His Presence is close at hand. ||2||
With each and every breath, I dwell upon You; I shall never forget You.
The more the Lord and Master dwells within the mind, the more the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.
Mind and body are Yours; You are my Master. Please rid me of my pride, and let me merge with You. ||3||
The One who formed this universe created the creation of the three worlds.
The Gurmukh knows the Divine Light, while the foolish self-willed manmukh gropes around in the darkness.
One who sees that Light within each and every heart understands the Essence of the Guru's Teachings. ||4||
Those who understand are Gurmukh; recognize and applaud them.
They meet and merge with the True One. They become the Radiant Manifestation of the Excellence of the True One.
O Nanak, they are contented with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They offer their bodies and souls to God. ||5||16||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Listen, O my mind, my friend, my darling: now is the time to meet the Lord.
As long as there is youth and breath, give this body to Him.
Without virtue, it is useless; the body shall crumble into a pile of dust. ||1||
O my mind, earn the profit, before you return home.
The Gurmukh praises the Naam, and the fire of egotism is extinguished. ||1||Pause||
Again and again, we hear and tell stories; we read and write and understand loads of knowledge,
but still, desires increase day and night, and the disease of egotism fills us with corruption.
That Carefree Lord cannot be appraised; His Real Value is known only through the Wisdom of the Guru's Teachings. ||2||
Even if someone has hundreds of thousands of clever mental tricks, and the love and company of hundreds of thousands of people
\-still, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he will not feel satisfied. Without the Name, all suffer in sorrow.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, O my soul, you shall be emancipated; as Gurmukh, you shall come to understand your own self. ||3||
I have sold my body and mind to the Guru, and I have given my mind and head as well.
I was seeking and searching for Him throughout the three worlds; then, as Gurmukh, I sought and found Him.
The True Guru has united me in Union, O Nanak, with that God. ||4||17||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
I have no anxiety about dying, and no hope of living.
You are the Cherisher of all beings; You keep the account of our breaths and morsels of food.
You abide within the Gurmukh. As it pleases You, You decide our allotment. ||1||
O my soul, chant the Name of the Lord; the mind will be pleased and appeased.
The raging fire within is extinguished; the Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 008

Know the state of your inner being; meet with the Guru and get rid of your skepticism.
To reach your True Home after you die, you must conquer death while you are still alive.
The beautiful, Unstruck Sound of the Shabad is obtained, contemplating the Guru. ||2||
The Unstruck Melody of Gurbani is obtained, and egotism is eliminated.
I am forever a sacrifice to those who serve their True Guru.
They are dressed in robes of honor in the Court of the Lord; the Name of the Lord is on their lips. ||3||
Wherever I look, I see the Lord pervading there, in the union of Shiva and Shakti, of consciousness and matter.
The three qualities hold the body in bondage; whoever comes into the world is subject to their play.
Those who separate themselves from the Lord wander lost in misery. The self-willed manmukhs do not attain union with Him. ||4||
If the mind becomes balanced and detached, and comes to dwell in its own true home, imbued with the Fear of God,
then it enjoys the essence of supreme spiritual wisdom; it shall never feel hunger again.
O Nanak, conquer and subdue this mind; meet with the Lord, and you shall never again suffer in pain. ||5||18||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
This foolish mind is greedy; through greed, it becomes even more attached to greed.
The evil-minded shaaktas, the faithless cynics, are not attuned to the Shabad; they come and go in reincarnation.
One who meets with the Holy True Guru finds the Treasure of Excellence. ||1||
O mind, renounce your egotistical pride.
Serve the Lord, the Guru, the Sacred Pool, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Chant the Name of the Lord day and night; become Gurmukh, and know the Wealth of the Lord.
All comforts and peace, and the Essence of the Lord, are enjoyed by acquiring spiritual wisdom in the Society of the Saints.
Day and night, continually serve the Lord God; the True Guru has given the Naam. ||2||
Those who practice falsehood are dogs; those who slander the Guru shall burn in their own fire.
They wander lost and confused, deceived by doubt, suffering in terrible pain. The Messenger of Death shall beat them to a pulp.
The self-willed manmukhs find no peace, while the Gurmukhs are wondrously joyful. ||3||
In this world, people are engrossed in false pursuits, but in the world hereafter, only the account of your true actions is accepted.
The Guru serves the Lord, His Intimate Friend. The Guru's actions are supremely exalted.
O Nanak, never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the True Lord shall bless you with His Mark of Grace. ||4||19||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Forgetting the Beloved, even for a moment, the mind is afflicted with terrible diseases.
How can honor be attained in His Court, if the Lord does not dwell in the mind?
Meeting with the Guru, peace is found. The fire is extinguished in His Glorious Praises. ||1||
O mind, enshrine the Praises of the Lord, day and night.
One who does not forget the Naam, for a moment or even an instant-how rare is such a person in this world! ||1||Pause||
When one's light merges into the Light, and one's intuitive consciousness is joined with the Intuitive Consciousness,
then one's cruel and violent instincts and egotism depart, and skepticism and sorrow are taken away.
The Lord abides within the mind of the Gurmukh, who merges in the Lord's Union, through the Guru. ||2||
If I surrender my body like a bride, the Enjoyer will enjoy me.
Do not make love with one who is just a passing show.
The Gurmukh is ravished like the pure and happy bride on the Bed of God, her Husband. ||3||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 009

The Gurmukh puts out the four fires, with the Water of the Lord's Name.
The lotus blossoms deep within the heart, and filled with Ambrosial Nectar, one is satisfied.
O Nanak, make the True Guru your friend; going to His Court, you shall obtain the True Lord. ||4||20||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, O my beloved; follow the Guru's Teachings, and speak of the Lord.
Apply the Touchstone of Truth to your mind, and see if it comes up to its full weight.
No one has found the worth of the ruby of the heart; its value cannot be estimated. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, the Diamond of the Lord is within the Guru.
The True Guru is found in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Day and night, praise the Word of His Shabad. ||1||Pause||
The True Merchandise, Wealth and Capital are obtained through the Radiant Light of the Guru.
Just as fire is extinguished by pouring on water, desire becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves.
The Messenger of Death will not touch you; in this way, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, carrying others across with you. ||2||
The Gurmukhs do not like falsehood. They are imbued with Truth; they love only Truth.
The shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not like the Truth; false are the foundations of the false.
Imbued with Truth, you shall meet the Guru. The true ones are absorbed into the True Lord. ||3||
Within the mind are emeralds and rubies, the Jewel of the Naam, treasures and diamonds.
The Naam is the True Merchandise and Wealth; in each and every heart, His Presence is deep and profound.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Diamond of the Lord, by His Kindness and Compassion. ||4||21||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The fire of doubt is not extinguished, even by wandering through foreign lands and countries.
If inner filth is not removed, one's life is cursed, and one's clothes are cursed.
There is no other way to perform devotional worship, except through the Teachings of the True Guru. ||1||
O mind, become Gurmukh, and extinguish the fire within.
Let the Words of the Guru abide within your mind; let egotism and desires die. ||1||Pause||
The jewel of the mind is priceless; through the Name of the Lord, honor is obtained.
Join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and find the Lord. The Gurmukh embraces love for the Lord.
Give up your selfishness, and you shall find peace; like water mingling with water, you shall merge in absorption. ||2||
Those who have not contemplated the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are unworthy; they come and go in reincarnation.
One who has not met with the True Guru, the Primal Being, is bothered and bewildered in the terrifying world-ocean.
This jewel of the soul is priceless, and yet it is being squandered like this, in exchange for a mere shell. ||3||
Those who joyfully meet with the True Guru are perfectly fulfilled and wise.
Meeting with the Guru, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. In the Court of the Lord, they are honored and approved.
O Nanak, their faces are radiant; the Music of the Shabad, the Word of God, wells up within them. ||4||22||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Make your deals, dealers, and take care of your merchandise.
Buy that object which will go along with you.
In the next world, the All-knowing Merchant will take this object and care for it. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, chant the Lord's Name, and focus your consciousness on Him.
Take the Merchandise of the Lord's Praises with you. Your Husband Lord shall see this and approve. ||1||Pause||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 010

Those who do not have the Assets of Truth-how can they find peace?
By dealing their deals of falsehood, their minds and bodies become false.
Like the deer caught in the trap, they suffer in terrible agony; they continually cry out in pain. ||2||
The counterfeit coins are not put into the Treasury; they do not obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord-Guru.
The false ones have no social status or honor. No one succeeds through falsehood.
Practicing falsehood again and again, people come and go in reincarnation, and forfeit their honor. ||3||
O Nanak, instruct your mind through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and praise the Lord.
Those who are imbued with the love of the Name of the Lord are not loaded down by doubt.
Those who chant the Name of the Lord earn great profits; the Fearless Lord abides within their minds. ||4||23||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Second House:
Wealth, the beauty of youth and flowers are guests for only a few days.
Like the leaves of the water-lily, they wither and fade and finally die. ||1||
Be happy, dear beloved, as long as your youth is fresh and delightful.
But your days are few-you have grown weary, and now your body has grown old. ||1||Pause||
My playful friends have gone to sleep in the graveyard.
In my double-mindedness, I shall have to go as well. I cry in a feeble voice. ||2||
Haven't you heard the call from beyond, O beautiful soul-bride?
You must go to your in-laws; you cannot stay with your parents forever. ||3||
O Nanak, know that she who sleeps in her parents' home is plundered in broad daylight.
She has lost her bouquet of merits; gathering one of demerits, she departs. ||4||24||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Second House:
He Himself is the Enjoyer, and He Himself is the Enjoyment. He Himself is the Ravisher of all.
He Himself is the Bride in her dress, He Himself is the Bridegroom on the bed. ||1||
My Lord and Master is imbued with love; He is totally permeating and pervading all. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the fisherman and the fish; He Himself is the water and the net.
He Himself is the sinker, and He Himself is the bait. ||2||
He Himself loves in so many ways. O sister soul-brides, He is my Beloved.
He continually ravishes and enjoys the happy soul-brides; just look at the plight I am in without Him! ||3||
Prays Nanak, please hear my prayer: You are the pool, and You are the soul-swan.
You are the lotus flower of the day and You are the water-lily of the night. You Yourself behold them, and blossom forth in bliss. ||4||25||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Third House:
Make this body the field, and plant the seed of good actions. Water it with the Name of the Lord, who holds all the world in His Hands.
Let your mind be the farmer; the Lord shall sprout in your heart, and you shall attain the state of Nirvaanaa. ||1||
You fool! Why are you so proud of Maya?
Father, children, spouse, mother and all relatives-they shall not be your helpers in the end. ||Pause||
So weed out evil, wickedness and corruption; leave these behind, and let your soul meditate on God.
When chanting, austere meditation and self-discipline become your protectors, then the lotus blossoms forth, and the honey trickles out. ||2||
Bring the twenty-seven elements of the body under your control, and throughout the three stages of life, remember death.
See the Infinite Lord in the ten directions, and in all the variety of nature. Says Nanak, in this way, the One Lord shall carry you across. ||3||26||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 011

Siree Raag, First Mehl, Third House:
Make good deeds the soil, and let the Word of the Shabad be the seed; irrigate it continually with the water of Truth.
Become such a farmer, and faith will sprout. This brings knowledge of heaven and hell, you fool! ||1||
Do not think that your Husband Lord can be obtained by mere words.
You are wasting this life in the pride of wealth and the splendor of beauty. ||1||Pause||
The defect of the body which leads to sin is the mud puddle, and this mind is the frog, which does not appreciate the lotus flower at all.
The bumble bee is the teacher who continually teaches the lesson. But how can one understand, unless one is made to understand? ||2||
This speaking and listening is like the song of the wind, for those whose minds are colored by the love of Maya.
The Grace of the Master is bestowed upon those who meditate on Him alone. They are pleasing to His Heart. ||3||
You may observe the thirty fasts, and say the five prayers each day, but ‘Satan’ can undo them.
Says Nanak, you will have to walk on the Path of Death, so why do you bother to collect wealth and property? ||4||27||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
He is the Master who has made the world bloom; He makes the Universe blossom forth, fresh and green.
He holds the water and the land in bondage. Hail to the Creator Lord! ||1||
Death, O Mullah-death will come,
so live in the Fear of God the Creator. ||1||Pause||
You are a Mullah, and you are a Qazi, only when you know the Naam, the Name of God.
You may be very educated, but no one can remain when the measure of life is full. ||2||
He alone is a Qazi, who renounces selfishness and conceit, and makes the One Name his Support.
The True Creator Lord is, and shall always be. He was not born; He shall not die. ||3||
You may chant your prayers five times each day; you may read the Bible and the Koran.
Says Nanak, the grave is calling you, and now your food and drink are finished. ||4||28||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
The dogs of greed are with me.
In the early morning, they continually bark at the wind.
Falsehood is my dagger; through deception, I eat the carcasses of the dead.
I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||1||
I have not followed good advice, nor have I done good deeds.
I am deformed and horribly disfigured.
Your Name alone, Lord, saves the world.
This is my hope; this is my support. ||1||Pause||
With my mouth I speak slander, day and night.
I spy on the houses of others-I am such a wretched low-life!
Unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger dwell in my body, like the outcasts who cremate the dead.
I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||2||
I make plans to trap others, although I appear gentle.
I am a robber-I rob the world.
I am very clever-I carry loads of sin.
I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||3||
I have not appreciated what You have done for me, Lord; I take from others and exploit them.
What face shall I show You, Lord? I am a sneak and a thief.
Nanak describes the state of the lowly.
I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||4||29||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
There is one awareness among all created beings.
None have been created without this awareness.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 012

As is their awareness, so is their way.
According to the account of our actions, we come and go in reincarnation. ||1||
Why, O soul, do you try such clever tricks?
Taking away and giving back, God does not delay. ||1||Pause||
All beings belong to You; all beings are Yours. O Lord and Master,
how can You become angry with them?
Even if You, O Lord and Master, become angry with them,
still, You are theirs, and they are Yours. ||2||
We are foul-mouthed; we spoil everything with our foul words.
You weigh us in the balance of Your Glance of Grace.
When one's actions are right, the understanding is perfect.
Without good deeds, it becomes more and more deficient. ||3||
Prays Nanak, what is the nature of the spiritual people?
They are self-realized; they understand God.
By Guru's Grace, they contemplate Him;
such spiritual people are honored in His Court. ||4||30||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
You are the River, All-knowing and All-seeing. I am just a fish-how can I find Your limit?
Wherever I look, You are there. Outside of You, I would burst and die. ||1||
I do not know of the fisherman, and I do not know of the net.
But when the pain comes, then I call upon You. ||1||Pause||
You are present everywhere. I had thought that You were far away.
Whatever I do, I do in Your Presence.
You see all my actions, and yet I deny them.
I have not worked for You, or Your Name. ||2||
Whatever You give me, that is what I eat.
There is no other door-unto which door should I go?
Nanak offers this one prayer:
this body and soul are totally Yours. ||3||
He Himself is near, and He Himself is far away; He Himself is in-between.
He Himself beholds, and He Himself listens. By His Creative Power, He created the world.
Whatever pleases Him, O Nanak-that Command is acceptable. ||4||31||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
Why should the created beings feel pride in their minds?
The Gift is in the Hands of the Great Giver.
As it pleases Him, He may give, or not give.
What can be done by the order of the created beings? ||1||
He Himself is True; Truth is pleasing to His Will.
The spiritually blind are unripe and imperfect, inferior and worthless. ||1||Pause||
The One who owns the trees of the forest and the plants of the garden
\-according to their nature, He gives them all their names.
The Flower and the Fruit of the Lord's Love are obtained by pre-ordained destiny.
As we plant, so we harvest and eat. ||2||
The wall of the body is temporary, as is the soul-mason within it.
The flavor of the intellect is bland and insipid without the Salt.
O Nanak, as He wills, He makes things right.
Without the Name, no one is approved. ||3||32||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fifth House:
The Undeceiveable is not deceived by deception. He cannot be wounded by any dagger.
As our Lord and Master keeps us, so do we exist. The soul of this greedy person is tossed this way and that. ||1||
Without the oil, how can the lamp be lit? ||1||Pause||
Let the reading of your prayer book be the oil, and let the Fear of God be the wick for the lamp of this body.
Light this lamp with the understanding of Truth. ||2||
Use this oil to light this lamp.
Light it, and meet your Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
This body is softened with the Word of the Guru's Bani;
you shall find peace, doing seva (selfless service).

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 013

All the world continues coming and going in reincarnation. ||3||
In the midst of this world, do seva,
and you shall be given a place of honor in the Court of the Lord.
Says Nanak, swing your arms in joy! ||4||33||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I serve my True Guru with single-minded devotion, and lovingly focus my consciousness on Him.
The True Guru is the mind's desire and the sacred shrine of pilgrimage, for those unto whom He has given this understanding.
The blessings of the wishes of the mind are obtained, and the fruits of one's desires.
Meditate on the Name, worship the Name, and through the Name, you shall be absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. ||1||
O my mind, drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and your thirst shall be quenched.
Those Gurmukhs who have tasted it remain intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who serve the True Guru obtain the Treasure of the Naam.
Deep within, they are drenched with the Essence of the Lord, and the egotistical pride of the mind is subdued.
The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and they intuitively center themselves in meditation.
Their minds become pure, and they remain immersed in the Lord; they are honored in His Court. ||2||
Those who serve the True Guru in this world are very rare.
Those who keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts subdue egotism and possessiveness.
I am a sacrifice to those who are in love with the Naam.
Those who attain the Inexhaustible Name of the Infinite Lord remain happy throughout the four ages. ||3||
Meeting with the Guru, the Naam is obtained, and the thirst of emotional attachment departs.
When the mind is permeated with the Lord, one remains detached within the home of the heart.
I am a sacrifice to those who enjoy the Sublime Taste of the Lord.
O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace, the True Name, the Treasure of Excellence, is obtained. ||4||1||34||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
People wear all sorts of costumes and wander all around, but in their hearts and minds, they practice deception.
They do not attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and after death, they sink into manure. ||1||
O mind, remain detached in the midst of your household.
Practicing truth, self-discipline and good deeds, the Gurmukh is enlightened. ||1||Pause||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mind is conquered, and one attains the State of Liberation in one's own home.
So meditate on the Name of the Lord; join and merge with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||2||
You may enjoy the pleasures of hundreds of thousands of women, and rule the nine continents of the world.
But without the True Guru, you will not find peace; you will be reincarnated over and over again. ||3||
Those who wear the Necklace of the Lord around their necks, and focus their consciousness on the Guru's Feet
\-wealth and supernatural spiritual powers follow them, but they do not care for such things at all. ||4||
Whatever pleases God's Will comes to pass. Nothing else can be done.
Servant Nanak lives by chanting the Naam. O Lord, please give it to me, in Your Natural Way. ||5||2||35||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 014

Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House:
Everyone belongs to the One who rules the Universe.
The Gurmukh practices good deeds, and the truth is revealed in the heart.
True is the reputation of the true, within whom truth abides.
Those who meet the True Lord are not separated again; they come to dwell in the home of the self deep within. ||1||
O my Lord! Without the Lord, I have no other at all.
The True Guru leads us to meet the Immaculate True God through the Word of His Shabad. ||1||Pause||
One whom the Lord merges into Himself is merged in the Shabad, and remains so merged.
No one merges with Him through the love of duality; over and over again, they come and go in reincarnation.
The One Lord permeates all. The One Lord is pervading everywhere.
That Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord shows His Kindness, is absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
After all their reading, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers argue and debate.
Their intellect and understanding are perverted; they just don't understand. They are filled with greed and corruption.
Through 8.4 million incarnations they wander lost and confused; through all their wandering and roaming, they are ruined.
They act according to their pre-ordained destiny, which no one can erase. ||3||
It is very difficult to serve the True Guru. Surrender your head; give up your selfishness.
Realizing the Shabad, one meets with the Lord, and all one's service is accepted.
By personally experiencing the Personality of the Guru, one's own personality is uplifted, and one's light merges into the Light.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny come to meet the True Guru. ||4||
O mind, don't cry out that you are hungry, always hungry; stop complaining.
The One who created the 8.4 million species of beings gives sustenance to all.
The Fearless Lord is forever Merciful; He takes care of all.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, and finds the Door of Liberation. ||5||3||36||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who hear and believe, find the home of the self deep within.
Through the Guru's Teachings, they praise the True Lord; they find the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence.
Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, they are immaculate and pure. I am forever a sacrifice to them.
Those people, within whose hearts the Lord abides, are radiant and enlightened. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Immaculate Lord, Har, Har.
Those whose have such pre-ordained destiny written on their foreheads-those Gurmukhs remain absorbed in the Lord's Love. ||1||Pause||
O Saints, see clearly that the Lord is near at hand; He is pervading everywhere.
Those who follow the Guru's Teachings realize Him, and see Him Ever-present.
He dwells forever in the minds of the virtuous. He is far removed from those worthless people who lack virtue.
The self-willed manmukhs are totally without virtue. Without the Name, they die in frustration. ||2||
Those who hear and believe in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, meditate on the Lord in their minds.
Night and day, they are steeped in devotion; their minds and bodies become pure.
The color of the world is false and weak; when it washes away, people cry out in pain.
Those who have the Radiant Light of the Naam within, become steady and stable, forever and ever. ||3||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 015

The blessing of this human life has been obtained, but still, people do not lovingly focus their thoughts on the Name of the Lord.
Their feet slip, and they cannot stay here any longer. And in the next world, they find no place of rest at all.
This opportunity shall not come again. In the end, they depart, regretting and repenting.
Those whom the Lord blesses with His Glance of Grace are saved; they are lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||4||
They all show off and pretend, but the self-willed manmukhs do not understand.
Those Gurmukhs who are pure of heart-their service is accepted.
They sing the Glorious Praise of the Lord; they read about the Lord each day. Singing the Praise of the Lord, they merge in absorption.
O Nanak, the words of those who are lovingly attuned to the Naam are true forever. ||5||4||37||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who meditate single-mindedly on the Naam, and contemplate the Teachings of the Guru
\-their faces are forever radiant in the Court of the True Lord.
They drink in the Ambrosial Nectar forever and ever, and they love the True Name. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, the Gurmukhs are honored forever.
They meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har, and they wash off the filth of egotism. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs do not know the Naam. Without the Name, they lose their honor.
They do not savor the Taste of the Shabad; they are attached to the love of duality.
They are worms in the filth of manure. They fall into manure, and into manure they are absorbed. ||2||
Fruitful are the lives of those who walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
Their families are saved; blessed are the mothers who gave birth to them.
By His Will He grants His Grace; those who are so blessed, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam; they eradicate selfishness and conceit from within.
They are pure, inwardly and outwardly; they merge into the Truest of the True.
O Nanak, blessed is the coming of those who follow the Guru's Teachings and meditate on the Lord. ||4||5||38||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The devotees of the Lord have the Wealth and Capital of the Lord; with Guru's Advice, they carry on their trade.
They praise the Name of the Lord forever and ever. The Name of the Lord is their Merchandise and Support.
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord into the Lord's devotees; it is an Inexhaustible Treasure. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, instruct your minds in this way.
O mind, why are you so lazy? Become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Naam. ||1||Pause||
Devotion to the Lord is love for the Lord. The Gurmukh reflects deeply and contemplates.
Hypocrisy is not devotion-speaking words of duality leads only to misery.
Those humble beings who are filled with keen understanding and meditative contemplation-even though they intermingle with others, they remain distinct. ||2||
Those who keep the Lord enshrined within their hearts are said to be the servants of the Lord.
Placing mind and body in offering before the Lord, they conquer and eradicate egotism from within.
Blessed and acclaimed is that Gurmukh, who shall never be defeated. ||3||
Those who receive His Grace find Him. Without His Grace, He cannot be found.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 016

The 8.4 million species of beings all yearn for the Lord. Those whom He unites, come to be united with the Lord.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Lord, and remains forever absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||4||6||39||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The Name of the Lord is the Ocean of Peace; the Gurmukhs obtain it.
Meditating on the Naam, night and day, they are easily and intuitively absorbed in the Naam.
Their inner beings are immersed in the True Lord; they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, the world is in misery, engrossed in the love of duality.
In the Sanctuary of the Guru, peace is found, meditating on the Naam night and day. ||1||Pause||
The truthful ones are not stained by filth. Meditating on the Lord, their minds remain pure.
The Gurmukhs realize the Word of the Shabad; they are immersed in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Name.
The Guru has lit the brilliant light of spiritual wisdom, and the darkness of ignorance has been dispelled. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs are polluted. They are filled with the pollution of egotism, wickedness and desire.
Without the Shabad, this pollution is not washed off; through the cycle of death and rebirth, they waste away in misery.
Engrossed in this transitory drama, they are not at home in either this world or the next. ||3||
For the Gurmukh, the love of the Name of the Lord is chanting, deep meditation and self-discipline.
The Gurmukh meditates forever on the Name of the One Creator Lord.
O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Support of all beings. ||4||7||40||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in emotional attachment; they are not balanced or detached.
They do not comprehend the Word of the Shabad. They suffer in pain forever, and lose their honor in the Court of the Lord.
The Gurmukhs shed their ego; attuned to the Naam, they find peace. ||1||
O my mind, day and night, you are always full of wishful hopes.
Serve the True Guru, and your emotional attachment shall be totally burnt away; remain detached within the home of your heart. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukhs do good deeds and blossom forth; balanced and detached in the Lord, they are in ecstasy.
Night and day, they perform devotional worship, day and night; subduing their ego, they are carefree.
By great good fortune, I found the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; I have found the Lord, with intuitive ease and ecstasy. ||2||
That person is a Holy Saadhu, and a renouncer of the world, whose heart is filled with the Naam.
His inner being is not touched by anger or dark energies at all; he has lost his selfishness and conceit.
The True Guru has revealed to him the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he drinks in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and is satisfied. ||3||
Whoever has found it, has done so in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Through perfect good fortune, such balanced detachment is attained.
The self-willed manmukhs wander around lost, but they do not know the True Guru. They are inwardly attached to egotism.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Shabad are dyed in the Color of the Lord's Name. Without the Fear of God, how can they retain this Color? ||4||8||41||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Within the home of your own inner being, the merchandise is obtained. All commodities are within.
Each and every moment, dwell on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukhs obtain it.
The Treasure of the Naam is inexhaustible. By great good fortune, it is obtained. ||1||
O my mind, give up slander, egotism and arrogance.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 017

Become Gurmukh, and meditate forever on the Dear Lord, the One and Only Creator. ||1||Pause||
The faces of the Gurmukhs are radiant and bright; they reflect on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
They obtain peace in this world and the next, chanting and meditating within their hearts on the Lord.
Within the home of their own inner being, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, reflecting on the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru shall have their faces blackened.
Night and day, they suffer in pain; they see the noose of Death always hovering above them.
Even in their dreams, they find no peace; they are consumed by the fires of intense anxiety. ||3||
The One Lord is the Giver of all; He Himself bestows all blessings.
No one else has any say in this; He gives just as He pleases.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs obtain Him; He Himself knows Himself. ||4||9||42||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Serve your True Lord and Master, and you shall be blessed with true greatness.
By Guru's Grace, He abides in the mind, and egotism is driven out.
This wandering mind comes to rest, when the Lord casts His Glance of Grace. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Name of the Lord.
The Treasure of the Naam abides forever within the mind, and one's place of rest is found in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||1||Pause||
The minds and bodies of the self-willed manmukhs are filled with darkness; they find no shelter, no place of rest.
Through countless incarnations they wander lost, like crows in a deserted house.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the heart is illuminated. Through the Shabad, the Name of the Lord is received. ||2||
In the corruption of the three qualities, there is blindness; in attachment to Maya, there is darkness.
The greedy people serve others, instead of the Lord, although they loudly announce their reading of scriptures.
They are burnt to death by their own corruption; they are not at home, on either this shore or the one beyond. ||3||
In attachment to Maya, they have forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World.
Without the Guru, all are unconscious; they are held in bondage by the Messenger of Death.
O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, you shall be saved, contemplating the True Name. ||4||10||43||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The three qualities hold people in attachment to Maya. The Gurmukh attains the fourth state of higher consciousness.
Granting His Grace, God unites us with Himself. The Name of the Lord comes to abide within the mind.
Those who have the treasure of goodness join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, follow the Guru's Teachings and dwell in truth.
Practice truth, and only truth, and merge in the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice to those who recognize the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Renouncing selfishness, I fall at their feet, and walk in harmony with His Will.
Earning the Profit of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am intuitively absorbed in the Naam. ||2||
Without the Guru, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is not found, and the Naam is not obtained.
Seek and find such a True Guru, who shall lead you to the True Lord.
Destroy your evil passions, and you shall dwell in peace. Whatever pleases the Lord comes to pass. ||3||
As one knows the True Guru, so is the peace obtained.
There is no doubt at all about this, but those who love Him are very rare.
O Nanak, the One Light has two forms; through the Shabad, union is attained. ||4||11||44||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 018

Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Discarding the Ambrosial Nectar, they greedily grab the poison; they serve others, instead of the Lord.
They lose their faith, they have no understanding; night and day, they suffer in pain.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not even think of the Lord; they are drowned to death without water. ||1||
O mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the Lord; seek the Protection of His Sanctuary.
If the Word of the Guru's Shabad abides deep within, then you shall not forget the Lord. ||1||Pause||
This body is the puppet of Maya. The evil of egotism is within it.
Coming and going through birth and death, the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor.
Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained, and one's light merges into the Light. ||2||
Serving the True Guru brings a deep and profound peace, and one's desires are fulfilled.
Abstinence, truthfulness and self-discipline are obtained, and the body is purified; the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell within the mind.
Such a person remains blissful forever, day and night. Meeting the Beloved, peace is found. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to those who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
In the Court of the True One, they are blessed with true greatness; they are intuitively absorbed into the True Lord.
O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace He is found; the Gurmukh is united in His Union. ||4||12||45||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh performs religious rituals, like the unwanted bride decorating her body.
Her Husband Lord does not come to her bed; day after day, she grows more and more miserable.
She does not attain the Mansion of His Presence; she does not find the door to His House. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, meditate on the Naam with one-pointed mind.
Remain united with the Society of the Saints; chant the Name of the Lord, and find peace. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukh is the happy and pure soul-bride forever. She keeps her Husband Lord enshrined within her heart.
Her speech is sweet, and her way of life is humble. She enjoys the Bed of her Husband Lord.
The happy and pure soul-bride is noble; she has infinite love for the Guru. ||2||
By perfect good fortune, one meets the True Guru, when one's destiny is awakened.
Suffering and doubt are cut out from within, and peace is obtained.
One who walks in harmony with the Guru's Will shall not suffer in pain. ||3||
The Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar, is in the Guru's Will. With intuitive ease, it is obtained.
Those who are destined to have it, drink it in; their egotism is eradicated from within.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and is united with the True Lord. ||4||13||46||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
If you know that He is your Husband Lord, offer your body and mind to Him.
Behave like the happy and pure soul-bride.
With intuitive ease, you shall merge with the True Lord, and He shall bless you with true greatness. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru, there is no devotional worship.
Without the Guru, devotion is not obtained, even though everyone may long for it. ||1||Pause||
The soul-bride in love with duality goes around the wheel of reincarnation, through 8.4 million incarnations.
Without the Guru, she finds no sleep, and she passes her life-night in pain.
Without the Shabad, she does not find her Husband Lord, and her life wastes away in vain. ||2||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 019

Practicing egotism, selfishness and conceit, she wanders around the world, but her wealth and property will not go with her.
The spiritually blind do not even think of the Naam; they are all bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death.
Meeting the True Guru, the wealth is obtained, contemplating the Name of the Lord in the heart. ||3||
Those who are attuned to the Naam are immaculate and pure; through the Guru, they obtain intuitive peace and poise.
Their minds and bodies are dyed in the Color of the Lord's Love, and their tongues savor His Sublime Essence.
O Nanak, that Primal Color which the Lord has applied, shall never fade away. ||4||14||47||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
By His Grace one becomes Gurmukh, worshipping the Lord with devotion. Without the Guru there is no devotional worship.
Those whom He unites with Himself, understand and become pure.
The Dear Lord is True, and True is the Word of His Bani. Through the Shabad, we merge with Him. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny: those who lack devotion-why have they even bothered to come into the world?
They do not serve the Perfect Guru; they waste away their lives in vain. ||1||Pause||
The Lord Himself, the Life of the World, is the Giver of Peace. He Himself forgives, and unites with Himself.
So what about all these poor beings and creatures? What can anyone say?
He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glory. He Himself enjoins us to His Service. ||2||
Gazing upon their families, people are lured and trapped by emotional attachment, but none will go along with them in the end.
Serving the True Guru, one finds the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. His Value cannot be estimated.
The Lord God is my Friend and Companion. God shall be my Helper and Support in the end. ||3||
Within your conscious mind, you may say anything, but without the Guru, selfishness is not removed.
The Dear Lord is the Giver, the Lover of His devotees. By His Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind.
O Nanak, by His Grace, He bestows enlightened awareness; God Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness. ||4||15||48||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Blessed is the mother who gave birth; blessed and respected is the father of one who serves the True Guru and finds peace. His arrogant pride is banished from within.
Standing at the Lord's Door, the humble Saints serve Him; they find the Treasure of Excellence. ||1||
O my mind, become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Lord.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad abides within the mind, and the body and mind become pure. ||1||Pause||
By His Grace, He has come into my home; He Himself has come to meet me.
Singing His Praises through the Shabads of the Guru, we are dyed in His Color with intuitive ease.
Becoming truthful, we merge with the True One; remaining blended with Him, we shall never be separated again. ||2||
Whatever is to be done, the Lord is doing. No one else can do anything.
Those separated from Him for so long are reunited with Him once again by the True Guru, who takes them into His Own Account.
He Himself assigns all to their tasks; nothing else can be done. ||3||
One whose mind and body are imbued with the Lord's Love gives up egotism and corruption.
Day and night, the Name of the One Lord, the Fearless and Formless One, dwells within the heart.
O Nanak, He blends us with Himself, through the Perfect, Infinite Word of His Shabad. ||4||16||49||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe is the Treasure of Excellence; His limits cannot be found.
He is not obtained by mouthing mere words, but by rooting out ego from within.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 020

Meeting the True Guru, one is permeated forever with the Fear of God, who Himself comes to dwell within the mind. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, one who becomes Gurmukh and understands this is very rare.
To act without understanding is to lose the treasure of this human life. ||1||Pause||
Those who have tasted it, enjoy its flavor; without tasting it, they wander in doubt, lost and deceived.
The True Name is the Ambrosial Nectar; no one can describe it.
Drinking it in, one becomes honorable, absorbed in the Perfect Word of the Shabad. ||2||
He Himself gives, and then we receive. Nothing else can be done.
The Gift is in the Hands of the Great Giver. At the Guru's Door, in the Gurdwara, it is received.
Whatever He does, comes to pass. All act according to His Will. ||3||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is abstinence, truthfulness, and self-restraint. Without the Name, no one becomes pure.
Through perfect good fortune, the Naam comes to abide within the mind. Through the Shabad, we merge into Him.
O Nanak, one who lives in intuitive peace and poise, imbued with the Lord's Love, obtains the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||17||50||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
You may torment your body with extremes of self-discipline, practice intensive meditation and hang upside-down, but your ego will not be eliminated from within.
You may perform religious rituals, and still never obtain the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, remain dead while yet alive, and the Name of the Lord shall come to dwell within the mind. ||1||
Listen, O my mind: hurry to the Protection of the Guru's Sanctuary.
By Guru's Grace you shall be saved. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean of poison. ||1||Pause||
Everything under the influence of the three qualities shall perish; the love of duality is corrupting.
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read the scriptures, but they are trapped in the bondage of emotional attachment. In love with evil, they do not understand.
Meeting the Guru, the bondage of the three qualities is cut away, and in the fourth state, the Door of Liberation is attained. ||2||
Through the Guru, the Path is found, and the darkness of emotional attachment is dispelled.
If one dies through the Shabad, then salvation is obtained, and one finds the Door of Liberation.
By Guru's Grace, one remains blended with the True Name of the Creator. ||3||
This mind is very powerful; we cannot escape it just by trying.
In the love of duality, people suffer in pain, condemned to terrible punishment.
O Nanak, those who are attached to the Naam are saved; through the Shabad, their ego is banished. ||4||18||51||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
By His Grace, the Guru is found, and the Name of the Lord is implanted within.
Without the Guru, no one has obtained it; they waste away their lives in vain.
The self-willed manmukhs create karma, and in the Court of the Lord, they receive their punishment. ||1||
O mind, give up the love of duality.
The Lord dwells within you; serving the Guru, you shall find peace. ||Pause||
When you love the Truth, your words are true; they reflect the True Word of the Shabad.
The Name of the Lord dwells within the mind; egotism and anger are wiped away.
Meditating on the Naam with a pure mind, the Door of Liberation is found. ||2||
Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes. It dies and is re-born; it continues coming and going in reincarnation.
The self-willed manmukhs do not recognize the Shabad; they forfeit their honor, and depart in disgrace.
Serving the Guru, the Name is obtained, and one remains absorbed in the True Lord. ||3||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 021

With faith in the Shabad, the Guru is found, and selfishness is eradicated from within.
Night and day, worship the True Lord with devotion and love forever.
The Treasure of the Naam abides in the mind; O Nanak, in the poise of perfect balance, merge into the Lord. ||4||19||52||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who do not serve the True Guru shall be miserable throughout the four ages.
The Primal Being is within their own home, but they do not recognize Him. They are plundered by their egotistical pride and arrogance.
Cursed by the True Guru, they wander around the world begging, until they are exhausted.
They do not serve the True Word of the Shabad, which is the solution to all of their problems. ||1||
O my mind, see the Lord ever close at hand.
He shall remove the pains of death and rebirth; the Word of the Shabad shall fill you to overflowing. ||1||Pause||
Those who praise the True One are true; the True Name is their Support.
They act truthfully, in love with the True Lord.
The True King has written His Order, which no one can erase.
The self-willed manmukhs do not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. The false are plundered by falsehood. ||2||
Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes. Without the Guru, there is utter darkness.
In emotional attachment to Maya, they have forgotten the Great Giver, the Giver of Peace.
Those who serve the True Guru are saved; they keep the True One enshrined in their hearts.
By His Grace, we find the Lord, and reflect on the True Word of the Shabad. ||3||
Serving the True Guru, the mind becomes immaculate and pure; egotism and corruption are discarded.
So abandon your selfishness, and remain dead while yet alive. Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The pursuit of worldly affairs comes to an end, when you embrace love for the True One.
Those who are attuned to Truth-their faces are radiant in the Court of the True Lord. ||4||
Those who do not have faith in the Primal Being, the True Guru, and who do not enshrine love for the Shabad
\-they take their cleansing baths, and give to charity again and again, but they are ultimately consumed by their love of duality.
When the Dear Lord Himself grants His Grace, they are inspired to love the Naam.
O Nanak, immerse yourself in the Naam, through the Infinite Love of the Guru. ||5||20||53||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Whom shall I serve? What shall I chant? I will go and ask the Guru.
I will accept the Will of the True Guru, and eradicate selfishness from within.
By this work and service, the Naam shall come to dwell within my mind.
Through the Naam, peace is obtained; I am adorned and embellished by the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||
O my mind, remain awake and aware night and day, and think of the Lord.
Protect your crops, or else the birds shall descend on your farm. ||1||Pause||
The desires of the mind are fulfilled, when one is filled to overflowing with the Shabad.
One who fears, loves, and is devoted to the Dear Lord day and night, sees Him always close at hand.
Doubt runs far away from the bodies of those, whose minds remain forever attuned to the True Word of the Shabad.
The Immaculate Lord and Master is found. He is True; He is the Ocean of Excellence. ||2||
Those who remain awake and aware are saved, while those who sleep are plundered.
They do not recognize the True Word of the Shabad, and like a dream, their lives fade away.
Like guests in a deserted house, they leave just exactly as they have come.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 022

The life of the self-willed manmukh passes uselessly. What face will he show when he passes beyond? ||3||
God Himself is everything; those who are in their ego cannot even speak of this.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized, and the pain of egotism is eradicated from within.
I fall at the feet of those who serve their True Guru.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who are found to be true in the True Court. ||4||21||54||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Consider the time and the moment-when should we worship the Lord?
Night and day, one who is attuned to the Name of the True Lord is true.
If someone forgets the Beloved Lord, even for an instant, what sort of devotion is that?
One whose mind and body are cooled and soothed by the True Lord-no breath of his is wasted. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord.
True devotional worship is performed when the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||Pause||
With intuitive ease, cultivate your farm, and plant the Seed of the True Name.
The seedlings have sprouted luxuriantly, and with intuitive ease, the mind is satisfied.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it in, thirst is quenched.
This true mind is attuned to Truth, and it remains permeated with the True One. ||2||
In speaking, in seeing and in words, remain immersed in the Shabad.
The Word of the Guru's Bani vibrates throughout the four ages. As Truth, it teaches Truth.
Egotism and possessiveness are eliminated, and the True One absorbs them into Himself.
Those who remain lovingly absorbed in the True One see the Mansion of His Presence close at hand. ||3||
By His Grace, we meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Without His Mercy, it cannot be obtained.
Through perfect good destiny, one finds the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and one comes to meet the True Guru.
Night and day, remain attuned to the Naam, and the pain of corruption shall be dispelled from within.
O Nanak, merging with the Shabad through the Name, one is immersed in the Name. ||4||22||55||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad are filled with the Fear of God.
They remain forever merged with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; they dwell upon the Glories of the True One.
They cast off the filth of their mental duality, and they keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts.
True is their speech, and true are their minds. They are in love with the True One. ||1||
O my mind, you are filled with the filth of egotism.
The Immaculate Lord is eternally Beautiful. We are adorned with the Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
God joins to Himself those whose minds are fascinated with the True Word of His Shabad.
Night and day, they are attuned to the Naam, and their light is absorbed into the Light.
Through His Light, God is revealed. Without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained.
The True Guru comes to meet those who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||2||
Without the Name, all are miserable. In the love of duality, they are ruined.
Without Him, I cannot survive even for an instant, and my life-night passes in anguish.
Wandering in doubt, the spiritually blind come and go in reincarnation, over and over again.
When God Himself bestows His Glance of Grace, He blends us into Himself. ||3||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 023

He hears and sees everything. How can anyone deny Him?
Those who sin again and again, shall rot and die in sin.
God's Glance of Grace does not come to them; those self-willed manmukhs do not obtain understanding.
They alone see the Lord, unto whom He reveals Himself. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs find Him. ||4||23||56||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Without the Guru, the disease is not cured, and the pain of egotism is not removed.
By Guru's Grace, He dwells in the mind, and one remains immersed in His Name.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found; without the Shabad, people wander, deceived by doubt. ||1||
O mind, dwell in the balanced state of your own inner being.
Praise the Lord's Name, and you shall no longer come and go in reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
The One Lord alone is the Giver, pervading everywhere. There is no other at all.
Praise the Word of the Shabad, and He shall come to dwell in your mind; you shall be blessed with intuitive peace and poise.
Everything is within the Lord's Glance of Grace. As He wishes, He gives. ||2||
In egotism, all must account for their actions. In this accounting, there is no peace.
Acting in evil and corruption, people are immersed in corruption.
Without the Name, they find no place of rest. In the City of Death, they suffer in agony. ||3||
Body and soul all belong to Him; He is the Support of all.
By Guru's Grace, understanding comes, and then the Door of Liberation is found.
O Nanak, sing the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He has no end or limitation. ||4||24||57||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who have the Support of the True Name are in ecstasy and peace forever.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they obtain the True One, the Destroyer of pain.
Forever and ever, they sing the Glorious Praises of the True One; they love the True Name.
When the Lord Himself grants His Grace, He bestows the treasure of devotion. ||1||
O mind, sing His Glorious Praises, and be in ecstasy forever.
Through the True Word of His Bani, the Lord is obtained, and one remains immersed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||
In true devotion, the mind is dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love, with intuitive peace and poise.
The mind is fascinated by the Word of the Guru's Shabad, which cannot be described.
The tongue imbued with the True Word of the Shabad drinks in the Amrit with delight, singing His Glorious Praises.
The Gurmukh obtains this love, when the Lord, in His Will, grants His Grace. ||2||
This world is an illusion; people pass their life-nights sleeping.
By the Pleasure of His Will, He lifts some out, and unites them with Himself.
He Himself abides in the mind, and drives out attachment to Maya.
He Himself bestows glorious greatness; He inspires the Gurmukh to understand. ||3||
The One Lord is the Giver of all. He corrects those who make mistakes.
He Himself has deceived some, and attached them to duality.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is found, and one's light merges into the Light.
Attuned to the Name of the Lord night and day, O Nanak, you shall be absorbed into the Name. ||4||25||58||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The virtuous obtain Truth; they give up their desires for evil and corruption.
Their minds are imbued with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; the Love of their Beloved is on their tongues.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 024

Without the True Guru, no one has found Him; reflect upon this in your mind and see.
The filth of the self-willed manmukhs is not washed off; they have no love for the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
O my mind, walk in harmony with the True Guru.
Dwell within the home of your own inner being, and drink in the Ambrosial Nectar; you shall attain the Peace of the Mansion of His Presence. ||1||Pause||
The unvirtuous have no merit; they are not allowed to sit in His Presence.
The self-willed manmukhs do not know the Shabad; those without virtue are far removed from God.
Those who recognize the True One are permeated and attuned to Truth.
Their minds are pierced through by the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and God Himself ushers them into His Presence. ||2||
He Himself dyes us in the Color of His Love; through the Word of His Shabad, He unites us with Himself.
This True Color shall not fade away, for those who are attuned to His Love.
The self-willed manmukhs grow weary of wandering around in all four directions, but they do not understand.
One who is united with the True Guru, meets and merges in the True Word of the Shabad. ||3||
I have grown weary of making so many friends, hoping that someone might be able to end my suffering.
Meeting with my Beloved, my suffering has ended; I have attained Union with the Word of the Shabad.
Earning Truth, and accumulating the Wealth of Truth, the truthful person gains a reputation of Truth.
Meeting with the True One, O Nanak, the Gurmukh shall not be separated from Him again. ||4||26||59||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The Creator Himself created the Creation; He produced the Universe, and He Himself watches over it.
The One and Only Lord is pervading and permeating all. The Unseen cannot be seen.
God Himself is Merciful; He Himself bestows understanding.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the True One dwells forever in the mind of those who remain lovingly attached to Him. ||1||
O my mind, surrender to the Guru's Will.
Mind and body are totally cooled and soothed, and the Naam comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||Pause||
Having created the creation, He supports it and takes care of it.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is realized, when He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace.
Those who are beautifully adorned with the Shabad in the Court of the True Lord
\-those Gurmukhs are attuned to the True Word of the Shabad; the Creator unites them with Himself. ||2||
Through the Guru's Teachings, praise the True One, who has no end or limitation.
He dwells in each and every heart, by the Hukam of His Command; by His Hukam, we contemplate Him.
So praise Him through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and drive out egotism from within.
That soul-bride who lacks the Lord's Name acts without virtue, and so she grieves. ||3||
Praising the True One, attached to the True One, I am satisfied with the True Name.
Contemplating His Virtues, I accumulate virtue and merit; I wash myself clean of demerits.
He Himself unites us in His Union; there is no more separation.
O Nanak, I sing the Praises of my Guru; through Him, I find that God. ||4||27||60||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Listen, listen, O soul-bride: you are overtaken by sexual desire-why do you walk like that, swinging your arms in joy?
You do not recognize your own Husband Lord! When you go to Him, what face will you show Him?
I touch the feet of my sister soul-brides who have known their Husband Lord.
If only I could be like them! Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I am united in His Union. ||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 025

O woman, the false ones are being cheated by falsehood.
God is your Husband; He is Handsome and True. He is obtained by reflecting upon the Guru. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs do not recognize their Husband Lord; how will they spend their life-night?
Filled with arrogance, they burn with desire; they suffer in the pain of the love of duality.
The happy soul-brides are attuned to the Shabad; their egotism is eliminated from within.
They enjoy their Husband Lord forever, and their life-night passes in the most blissful peace. ||2||
She is utterly lacking in spiritual wisdom; she is abandoned by her Husband Lord. She cannot obtain His Love.
In the darkness of intellectual ignorance, she cannot see her Husband, and her hunger does not depart.
Come and meet with me, my sister soul-brides, and unite me with my Husband.
She who meets the True Guru, by perfect good fortune, finds her Husband; she is absorbed in the True One. ||3||
Those upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace become His happy soul-brides.
One who recognizes her Lord and Master places her body and mind in offering before Him.
Within her own home, she finds her Husband Lord; her egotism is dispelled.
O Nanak, the happy soul-brides are embellished and exalted; night and day they are absorbed in devotional worship. ||4||28||61||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Some enjoy their Husband Lord; unto whose door should I go to ask for Him?
I serve my True Guru with love, that He may lead me to Union with my Husband Lord.
He created all, and He Himself watches over us. Some are close to Him, and some are far away.
She who knows her Husband Lord to be always with her, enjoys His Constant Presence. ||1||
O woman, you must walk in harmony with the Guru's Will.
Night and day, you shall enjoy your Husband, and you shall intuitively merge into the True One. ||1||Pause||
Attuned to the Shabad, the happy soul-brides are adorned with the True Word of the Shabad.
Within their own home, they obtain the Lord as their Husband, with love for the Guru.
Upon her beautiful and cozy bed, she enjoys the Love of her Lord. She is overflowing with the treasure of devotion.
That Beloved God abides in her mind; He gives His Support to all. ||2||
I am forever a sacrifice to those who praise their Husband Lord.
I dedicate my mind and body to them, and give my head as well; I fall at their feet.
Those who recognize the One renounce the love of duality.
The Gurmukh recognizes the Naam, O Nanak, and is absorbed into the True One. ||3||29||62||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
O Dear Lord, You are the Truest of the True. All things are in Your Power.
The 8.4 million species of beings wander around searching for You, but without the Guru, they do not find You.
When the Dear Lord grants His Forgiveness, this human body finds lasting peace.
By Guru's Grace, I serve the True One, who is Immeasurably Deep and Profound. ||1||
O my mind, attuned to the Naam, you shall find peace.
Follow the Guru's Teachings, and praise the Naam; there is no other at all. ||1||Pause||
The Righteous Judge of Dharma, by the Hukam of God's Command, sits and administers True Justice.
Those evil souls, ensnared by the love of duality, are subject to Your Command.
The souls on their spiritual journey chant and meditate within their minds on the One Lord, the Treasure of Excellence.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 026

The Righteous Judge of Dharma serves them; blessed is the Lord who adorns them. ||2||
One who eliminates mental wickedness from within the mind, and casts out emotional attachment and egotistical pride,
comes to recognize the All-pervading Soul, and is intuitively absorbed into the Naam.
Without the True Guru, the self-willed manmukhs do not find liberation; they wander around like lunatics.
They do not contemplate the Shabad; engrossed in corruption, they utter only empty words. ||3||
He Himself is everything; there is no other at all.
I speak just as He makes me speak, when He Himself makes me speak.
The Word of the Gurmukh is God Himself. Through the Shabad, we merge in Him.
O Nanak, remember the Naam; serving Him, peace is obtained. ||4||30||63||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The world is polluted with the filth of egotism, suffering in pain. This filth sticks to them because of their love of duality.
This filth of egotism cannot be washed away, even by taking cleansing baths at hundreds of sacred shrines.
Performing all sorts of rituals, people are smeared with twice as much filth.
This filth is not removed by studying. Go ahead, and ask the wise ones. ||1||
O my mind, coming to the Sanctuary of the Guru, you shall become immaculate and pure.
The self-willed manmukhs have grown weary of chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, but their filth cannot be removed. ||1||Pause||
With a polluted mind, devotional service cannot be performed, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, cannot be obtained.
The filthy, self-willed manmukhs die in filth, and they depart in disgrace.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to abide in the mind, and the filth of egotism is dispelled.
Like a lamp lit in the darkness, the spiritual wisdom of the Guru dispels ignorance. ||2||
“I have done this, and I will do that”-I am an idiotic fool for saying this!
I have forgotten the Doer of all; I am caught in the love of duality.
There is no pain as great as the pain of Maya; it drives people to wander all around the world, until they become exhausted.
Through the Guru's Teachings, peace is found, with the True Name enshrined in the heart. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to those who meet and merge with the Lord.
This mind is attuned to devotional worship; through the True Word of Gurbani, it finds its own home.
With the mind so imbued, and the tongue imbued as well, sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.
O Nanak, never forget the Naam; immerse yourself in the True One. ||4||31||64||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl, First House:
Within my mind and body is the intense pain of separation; how can my Beloved come to meet me in my home?
When I see my God, seeing God Himself, my pain is taken away.
I go and ask my friends, “How can I meet and merge with God?”||1||
O my True Guru, without You I have no other at all.
I am foolish and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary. Please be Merciful and unite me with the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The True Guru is the Giver of the Name of the Lord. God Himself causes us to meet Him.
The True Guru understands the Lord God. There is no other as Great as the Guru.
I have come and collapsed in the Guru's Sanctuary. In His Kindness, He has united me with God. ||2||
No one has found Him by stubborn-mindedness. All have grown weary of the effort.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 027

Thousands of clever mental tricks have been tried, but still, the raw and undisciplined mind does not absorb the Color of the Lord's Love.
By falsehood and deception, none have found Him. Whatever you plant, you shall eat. ||3||
O God, You are the Hope of all. All beings are Yours; You are the Wealth of all.
O God, none return from You empty-handed; at Your Door, the Gurmukhs are praised and acclaimed.
In the terrifying world-ocean of poison, people are drowning-please lift them up and save them! This is servant Nanak's humble prayer. ||4||1||65||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
Receiving the Naam, the mind is satisfied; without the Naam, life is cursed.
If I meet the Gurmukh, my Spiritual Friend, he will show me God, the Treasure of Excellence.
I am every bit a sacrifice to one who reveals to me the Naam. ||1||
O my Beloved, I live by meditating on Your Name.
Without Your Name, my life does not even exist. My True Guru has implanted the Naam within me. ||1||Pause||
The Naam is a Priceless Jewel; it is with the Perfect True Guru.
When one is enjoined to serve the True Guru, He brings out this Jewel and bestows this enlightenment.
Blessed, and most fortunate of the very fortunate, are those who come to meet the Guru. ||2||
Those who have not met the Primal Being, the True Guru, are most unfortunate, and are subject to death.
They wander in reincarnation over and over again, as the most disgusting maggots in manure.
Do not meet with, or even approach those people, whose hearts are filled with horrible anger. ||3||
The True Guru, the Primal Being, is the Pool of Ambrosial Nectar. The very fortunate ones come to bathe in it.
The filth of many incarnations is washed away, and the Immaculate Naam is implanted within.
Servant Nanak has obtained the most exalted state, lovingly attuned to the True Guru. ||4||2||66||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
I sing His Glories, I describe His Glories, I speak of His Glories, O my mother.
The Gurmukhs, my spiritual friends, bestow virtue. Meeting with my spiritual friends, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The Diamond of the Guru has pierced the diamond of my mind, which is now dyed in the deep crimson color of the Name. ||1||
O my Lord of the Universe, singing Your Glorious Praises, my mind is satisfied.
Within me is the thirst for the Lord's Name; may the Guru, in His Pleasure, grant it to me. ||1||Pause||
Let your minds be imbued with His Love, O blessed and fortunate ones. By His Pleasure, the Guru bestows His Gifts.
The Guru has lovingly implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.
Without the True Guru, the Name of the Lord is not found, even though people may perform hundreds of thousands, even millions of rituals. ||2||
Without destiny, the True Guru is not found, even though He sits within the home of our own inner being, always near and close at hand.
There is ignorance within, and the pain of doubt, like a separating screen.
Without meeting with the True Guru, no one is transformed into gold. The self-willed manmukh sinks like iron, while the boat is very close. ||3||
The Boat of the True Guru is the Name of the Lord. How can we climb on board?
One who walks in harmony with the True Guru's Will comes to sit in this Boat.
Blessed, blessed are those very fortunate ones, O Nanak, who are united with the Lord through the True Guru. ||4||3||67||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 028

Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
I stand by the wayside and ask the Way. If only someone would show me the Way to God-I would go with him.
I follow in the footsteps of those who enjoy the Love of my Beloved.
I beg of them, I implore them; I have such a yearning to meet God! ||1||
O my Siblings of Destiny, please unite me in Union with my Lord God.
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has shown me the Lord God. ||1||Pause||
In deep humility, I fall at the Feet of the Perfect True Guru.
The Guru is the Honor of the dishonored. The Guru, the True Guru, brings approval and applause.
I am never tired of praising the Guru, who unites me with the Lord God. ||2||
Everyone, all over the world, longs for the True Guru.
Without the good fortune of destiny, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is not obtained. The unfortunate ones just sit and cry.
All things happen according to the Will of the Lord God. No one can erase the pre-ordained Writ of Destiny. ||3||
He Himself is the True Guru; He Himself is the Lord. He Himself unites in His Union.
In His Kindness, He unites us with Himself, as we follow the Guru, the True Guru.
Over all the world, He is the Life of the World, O Nanak, like water mingled with water. ||4||4||68||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
The Essence of the Ambrosial Naam is the most sublime essence; how can I get to taste this essence?
I go and ask the happy soul-brides, “How did you come to meet God?”
They are care-free and do not speak; I massage and wash their feet. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, meet with your spiritual friend, and dwell upon the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The True Guru, the Primal Being, is your Friend, who shall drive out pain and subdue your ego. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukhs are the happy soul-brides; their minds are filled with kindness.
The Word of the True Guru is the Jewel. One who believes in it tastes the Sublime Essence of the Lord.
Those who partake of the Lord's Sublime Essence, through the Guru's Love, are known as great and very fortunate. ||2||
This Sublime Essence of the Lord is in the forests, in the fields and everywhere, but the unfortunate ones do not taste it.
Without the True Guru, it is not obtained. The self-willed manmukhs continue to cry in misery.
They do not bow before the True Guru; the demon of anger is within them. ||3||
The Lord Himself, Har, Har, Har, is the Sublime Essence. The Lord Himself is the Essence.
In His Kindness, He blesses the Gurmukh with it; the Ambrosial Nectar of this Amrit trickles down.
Then, the body and mind totally blossom forth and flourish; O Nanak, the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. ||4||5||69||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
The day dawns, and then it ends, and the night passes away.
Man's life is diminishing, but he does not understand. Each day, the mouse of death is gnawing away at the rope of life.
Maya spreads out like sweet molasses; the self-willed manmukh is stuck like a fly, rotting away. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, God is my Friend and Companion.
Emotional attachment to children and spouse is poison; in the end, no one will go along with you as your helper. ||1||Pause||
Through the Guru's Teachings, some embrace love for the Lord, and are saved. They remain detached and unaffected, and they find the Sanctuary of the Lord.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 029

They keep death constantly before their eyes; they gather the Provisions of the Lord's Name, and receive honor.
The Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord. The Lord Himself takes them in His Loving Embrace. ||2||
For the Gurmukhs, the Way is obvious. At the Lord's Door, they face no obstructions.
They praise the Lord's Name, they keep the Naam in their minds, and they remain attached to the Love of the Naam.
The Unstruck Celestial Music vibrates for them at the Lord's Door, and they are honored at the True Door. ||3||
Those Gurmukhs who praise the Naam are applauded by everyone.
Grant me their company, God-I am a beggar; this is my prayer.
O Nanak, great is the good fortune of those Gurmukhs, who are filled with the Light of the Naam within. ||4||33||31||6||70||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, First House:
Why are you so thrilled by the sight of your son and your beautifully decorated wife?
You enjoy tasty delicacies, you have lots of fun, and you indulge in endless pleasures.
You give all sorts of commands, and you act so superior.
The Creator does not come into the mind of the blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukh. ||1||
O my mind, the Lord is the Giver of peace.
By Guru's Grace, He is found. By His Mercy, He is obtained. ||1||Pause||
People are entangled in the enjoyment of fine clothes, but gold and silver are only dust.
They acquire beautiful horses and elephants, and ornate carriages of many kinds.
They think of nothing else, and they forget all their relatives.
They ignore their Creator; without the Name, they are impure. ||2||
Gathering the wealth of Maya, you earn an evil reputation.
Those whom you work to please shall pass away along with you.
The egotistical are engrossed in egotism, ensnared by the intellect of the mind.
One who is deceived by God Himself, has no position and no honor. ||3||
The True Guru, the Primal Being, has led me to meet the One, my only Friend.
The One is the Saving Grace of His humble servant. Why should the proud cry out in ego?
As the servant of the Lord wills, so does the Lord act. At the Lord's Door, none of his requests are denied.
Nanak is attuned to the Love of the Lord, whose Light pervades the entire Universe. ||4||1||71||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
With the mind caught up in playful pleasures, involved in all sorts of amusements and sights that stagger the eyes, people are led astray.
The emperors sitting on their thrones are consumed by anxiety. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, peace is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
If the Supreme Lord, the Architect of Destiny, writes such an order, then anguish and anxiety are erased. ||1||Pause||
There are so many places-I have wandered through them all.
The masters of wealth and the great land-lords have fallen, crying out, “This is mine! This is mine!”||2||
They issue their commands fearlessly, and act in pride.
They subdue all under their command, but without the Name, they are reduced to dust. ||3||
Even those who are served by the 33 million angelic beings, at whose door the Siddhas and the Saadhus stand,
who live in wondrous affluence and rule over mountains, oceans and vast dominions-O Nanak, in the end, all this vanishes like a dream! ||4||2||72||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 030

Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Arising each day, you cherish your body, but you are idiotic, ignorant and without understanding.
You are not conscious of God, and your body shall be cast into the wilderness.
Focus your consciousness on the True Guru; you shall enjoy bliss forever and ever. ||1||
O mortal, you came here to earn a profit.
What useless activities are you attached to? Your life-night is coming to its end. ||1||Pause||
The animals and the birds frolic and play-they do not see death.
Mankind is also with them, trapped in the net of Maya.
Those who always remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are considered to be liberated. ||2||
That dwelling which you will have to abandon and vacate-you are attached to it in your mind.
And that place where you must go to dwell-you have no regard for it at all.
Those who fall at the Feet of the Guru are released from this bondage. ||3||
No one else can save you-don't look for anyone else.
I have searched in all four directions; I have come to find His Sanctuary.
O Nanak, the True King has pulled me out and saved me from drowning! ||4||3||73||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
For a brief moment, man is a guest of the Lord; he tries to resolve his affairs.
Engrossed in Maya and sexual desire, the fool does not understand.
He arises and departs with regret, and falls into the clutches of the Messenger of Death. ||1||
You are sitting on the collapsing riverbank-are you blind?
If you are so pre-destined, then act according to the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||
The Reaper does not look upon any as unripe, half-ripe or fully ripe.
Picking up and wielding their sickles, the harvesters arrive.
When the landlord gives the order, they cut and measure the crop. ||2||
The first watch of the night passes away in worthless affairs, and the second passes in deep sleep.
In the third, they babble nonsense, and when the fourth watch comes, the day of death has arrived.
The thought of the One who bestows body and soul never enters the mind. ||3||
I am devoted to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; I sacrifice my soul to them.
Through them, understanding has entered my mind, and I have met the All-knowing Lord God.
Nanak sees the Lord always with him-the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||4||74||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Let me forget everything, but let me not forget the One Lord.
All my evil pursuits have been burnt away; the Guru has blessed me with the Naam, the true object of life.
Give up all other hopes, and rely on the One Hope.
Those who serve the True Guru receive a place in the world hereafter. ||1||
O my mind, praise the Creator.
Give up all your clever tricks, and fall at the Feet of the Guru. ||1||Pause||
Pain and hunger shall not oppress you, if the Giver of Peace comes into your mind.
No undertaking shall fail, when the True Lord is always in your heart.
No one can kill that one unto whom You, Lord, give Your Hand and protect.
Serve the Guru, the Giver of Peace; He shall remove and wash off all your faults. ||2||
Your servant begs to serve those who are enjoined to Your service.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 031

The opportunity to work hard serving the Saadh Sangat is obtained, when the Divine Lord is pleased.
Everything is in the Hands of our Lord and Master; He Himself is the Doer of deeds.
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who fulfills all hopes and desires. ||3||
The One appears to be my Companion; the One is my Brother and Friend.
The elements and the components are all made by the One; they are held in their order by the One.
When the mind accepts, and is satisfied with the One, then the consciousness becomes steady and stable.
Then, one's food is the True Name, one's garments are the True Name, and one's Support, O Nanak, is the True Name. ||4||5||75||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
All things are received if the One is obtained.
The precious gift of this human life becomes fruitful when one chants the True Word of the Shabad.
One who has such destiny written on his forehead enters the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, through the Guru. ||1||
O my mind, focus your consciousness on the One.
Without the One, all entanglements are worthless; emotional attachment to Maya is totally false. ||1||Pause||
Hundreds of thousands of princely pleasures are enjoyed, if the True Guru bestows His Glance of Grace.
If He bestows the Name of the Lord, for even a moment, my mind and body are cooled and soothed.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny hold tight to the Feet of the True Guru. ||2||
Fruitful is that moment, and fruitful is that time, when one is in love with the True Lord.
Suffering and sorrow do not touch those who have the Support of the Name of the Lord.
Grasping him by the arm, the Guru lifts them up and out, and carries them across to the other side. ||3||
Embellished and immaculate is that place where the Saints gather together.
He alone finds shelter, who has met the Perfect Guru.
Nanak builds his house upon that site where there is no death, no birth, and no old age. ||4||6||76||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate on Him, O my soul; He is the Supreme Lord over kings and emperors.
Place the hopes of your mind in the One, in whom all have faith.
Give up all your clever tricks, and grasp the Feet of the Guru. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Name with intuitive peace and poise.
Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on God. Constantly sing the Glories of the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
Seek His Shelter, O my mind; there is no other as Great as He.
Remembering Him in meditation, a profound peace is obtained. Pain and suffering will not touch you at all.
Forever and ever, work for God; He is our True Lord and Master. ||2||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall become absolutely pure, and the noose of death shall be cut away.
So offer your prayers to Him, the Giver of Peace, the Destroyer of fear.
Showing His Mercy, the Merciful Master shall resolve your affairs. ||3||
The Lord is said to be the Greatest of the Great; His Kingdom is the Highest of the High.
He has no color or mark; His Value cannot be estimated.
Please show Mercy to Nanak, God, and bless him with Your True Name. ||4||7||77||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
One who meditates on the Naam is at peace; his face is radiant and bright.
Obtaining it from the Perfect Guru, he is honored all over the world.
In the Company of the Holy, the One True Lord comes to abide within the home of the self. ||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 032

O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Naam is your Companion; it shall always be with you. It shall save you in the world hereafter. ||1||Pause||
What good is worldly greatness?
All the pleasures of Maya are tasteless and insipid. In the end, they shall all fade away.
Perfectly fulfilled and supremely acclaimed is the one, in whose heart the Lord abides. ||2||
Become the dust of the Saints; renounce your selfishness and conceit.
Give up all your schemes and your clever mental tricks, and fall at the Feet of the Guru.
He alone receives the Jewel, upon whose forehead such wondrous destiny is written. ||3||
O Siblings of Destiny, it is received only when God Himself bestows it.
People serve the True Guru only when the fever of egotism has been eradicated.
Nanak has met the Guru; all his sufferings have come to an end. ||4||8||78||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
The One is the Knower of all beings; He alone is our Savior.
The One is the Support of the mind; the One is the Support of the breath of life.
In His Sanctuary there is eternal peace. He is the Supreme Lord God, the Creator. ||1||
O my mind, give up all these efforts.
Dwell upon the Perfect Guru each day, and attach yourself to the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
The One is my Brother, the One is my Friend. The One is my Mother and Father.
The One is the Support of the mind; He has given us body and soul.
May I never forget God from my mind; He holds all in the Power of His Hands. ||2||
The One is within the home of the self, and the One is outside as well. He Himself is in all places and interspaces.
Meditate twenty-four hours a day on the One who created all beings and creatures.
Attuned to the Love of the One, there is no sorrow or suffering. ||3||
There is only the One Supreme Lord God; there is no other at all.
Soul and body all belong to Him; whatever pleases His Will comes to pass.
Through the Perfect Guru, one becomes perfect; O Nanak, meditate on the True One. ||4||9||79||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Those who focus their consciousness on the True Guru are perfectly fulfilled and famous.
Spiritual wisdom wells up in the minds of those unto whom the Lord Himself shows Mercy.
Those who have such destiny written upon their foreheads obtain the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the One Lord.
The happiness of all happiness shall well up, and in the Court of the Lord, you shall be dressed in robes of honor. ||1||Pause||
The fear of death and rebirth is removed by performing loving devotional service to the Lord of the World.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one becomes immaculate and pure; the Lord Himself takes care of such a one.
The filth of birth and death is washed away, and one is uplifted, beholding the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||2||
The Supreme Lord God is pervading all places and interspaces.
The One is the Giver of all-there is no other at all.
In His Sanctuary, one is saved. Whatever He wishes, comes to pass. ||3||
Perfectly fulfilled and famous are those, in whose minds the Supreme Lord God abides.
Their reputation is spotless and pure; they are famous all over the world.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on my God. ||4||10||80||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 033

Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Meeting the True Guru, all my sufferings have ended, and the Peace of the Lord has come to dwell within my mind.
The Divine Light illuminates my inner being, and I am lovingly absorbed in the One.
Meeting with the Holy Saint, my face is radiant; I have realized my pre-ordained destiny.
I constantly sing the Glories of the Lord of the Universe. Through the True Name, I have become spotlessly pure. ||1||
O my mind, you shall find peace through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Working for the Perfect Guru, no one goes away empty-handed. ||1||Pause||
The desires of the mind are fulfilled, when the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained.
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is always with you; recognize Him as the Creator.
By Guru's Grace, your face shall be radiant. Chanting the Naam, you shall receive the benefits of giving charity and taking cleansing baths.
Sexual desire, anger and greed are eliminated, and all egotistical pride is abandoned. ||2||
The Profit of the Naam is obtained, and all affairs are brought to fruition.
In His Mercy, God unites us with Himself, and He blesses us with the Naam.
My comings and goings in reincarnation have come to an end; He Himself has bestowed His Mercy.
I have obtained my home in the True Mansion of His Presence, realizing the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||
His humble devotees are protected and saved; He Himself showers His Blessings upon us.
In this world and in the world hereafter, radiant are the faces of those who cherish and enshrine the Glories of the True Lord.
Twenty-four hours a day, they lovingly dwell upon His Glories; they are imbued with His Infinite Love.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord God, the Ocean of Peace. ||4||11||81||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
If we meet the Perfect True Guru, we obtain the Treasure of the Shabad.
Please grant Your Grace, God, that we may meditate on Your Ambrosial Naam.
The pains of birth and death are taken away; we are intuitively centered on His Meditation. ||1||
O my mind, seek the Sanctuary of God.
Without the Lord, there is no other at all. Meditate on the One and only Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
His Value cannot be estimated; He is the Vast Ocean of Excellence.
O most fortunate ones, join the Sangat, the Blessed Congregation; purchase the True Word of the Shabad.
Serve the Lord, the Ocean of Peace, the Supreme Lord over kings and emperors. ||2||
I take the Support of the Lord's Lotus Feet; there is no other place of rest for me.
I lean upon You as my Support, O Supreme Lord God. I exist only by Your Power.
O God, You are the Honor of the dishonored. I seek to merge with You. ||3||
Chant the Lord's Name and contemplate the Lord of the World, twenty-four hours a day.
He preserves our soul, our breath of life, body and wealth. By His Grace, He protects our soul.
O Nanak, all pain has been washed away, by the Supreme Lord God, the Forgiver. ||4||12||82||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
I have fallen in love with the True Lord. He does not die, He does not come and go.
In separation, He is not separated from us; He is pervading and permeating amongst all.
He is the Destroyer of the pain and suffering of the meek. He bears True Love for His servants.
Wondrous is the Form of the Immaculate One. Through the Guru, I have met Him, O my mother! ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, make God your Friend.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 034

Cursed is emotional attachment and love of Maya; no one is seen to be at peace. ||1||Pause||
God is Wise, Giving, Tender-hearted, Pure, Beautiful and Infinite.
He is our Companion and Helper, Supremely Great, Lofty and Utterly Infinite.
He is not known as young or old; His Court is Steady and Stable.
Whatever we seek from Him, we receive. He is the Support of the unsupported. ||2||
Seeing Him, our evil inclinations vanish; mind and body become peaceful and tranquil.
With one-pointed mind, meditate on the One Lord, and the doubts of your mind will be dispelled.
He is the Treasure of Excellence, the Ever-fresh Being. His Gift is Perfect and Complete.
Forever and ever, worship and adore Him. Day and night, do not forget Him. ||3||
One whose destiny is so pre-ordained, obtains the Lord of the Universe as his Companion.
I dedicate my body, mind, wealth and all to Him. I totally sacrifice my soul to Him.
Seeing and hearing, He is always close at hand. In each and every heart, God is pervading.
Even the ungrateful ones are cherished by God. O Nanak, He is forever the Forgiver. ||4||13||83||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
This mind, body and wealth were given by God, who naturally adorns us.
He has blessed us with all our energy, and infused His Infinite Light deep within us.
Forever and ever, meditate in remembrance on God; keep Him enshrined in your heart. ||1||
O my mind, without the Lord, there is no other at all.
Remain in God's Sanctuary forever, and no suffering shall afflict you. ||1||Pause||
Jewels, treasures, pearls, gold and silver-all these are just dust.
Mother, father, children and relatives-all relations are false.
The self-willed manmukh is an insulting beast; he does not acknowledge the One who created him. ||2||
The Lord is pervading within and beyond, and yet people think that He is far away.
They are engrossed in clinging desires; within their hearts there is ego and falsehood.
Without devotion to the Naam, crowds of people come and go. ||3||
Please preserve Your beings and creatures, God; O Creator Lord, please be merciful!
Without God, there is no saving grace. The Messenger of Death is cruel and unfeeling.
O Nanak, may I never forget the Naam! Please bless me with Your Mercy, Lord! ||4||14||84||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
“My body and my wealth; my ruling power, my beautiful form and country-mine!”
You may have children, a wife and many mistresses; you may enjoy all sorts of pleasures and fine clothes.
And yet, if the Name of the Lord does not abide within the heart, none of it has any use or value. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Always keep the Company of the Holy, and focus your consciousness on the Feet of the Guru. ||1||Pause||
Those who have such blessed destiny written on their foreheads meditate on the Treasure of the Naam.
All their affairs are brought to fruition, holding onto the Guru's Feet.
The diseases of ego and doubt are cast out; they shall not come and go in reincarnation. ||2||
Let the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, be your cleansing baths at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Your soul, breath of life, mind and body shall blossom forth in lush profusion; this is the true purpose of life.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 035

In this world you shall be blessed with greatness, and in the Court of the Lord you shall find your place of rest. ||3||
God Himself acts, and causes others to act; everything is in His Hands.
He Himself bestows life and death; He is with us, within and beyond.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the Master of all hearts. ||4||15||85||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
The Guru is Merciful; we seek the Sanctuary of God.
Through the Teachings of the True Guru, all worldly entanglements are eliminated.
The Name of the Lord is firmly implanted within my mind; through His Ambrosial Glance of Grace, I am exalted and enraptured. ||1||
O my mind, serve the True Guru.
God Himself grants His Grace; do not forget Him, even for an instant. ||Pause||
Continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the Destroyer of demerits.
Without the Name of the Lord, there is no peace. Having tried all sorts of ostentatious displays, I have come to see this.
Intuitively imbued with His Praises, one is saved, crossing over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
The merits of pilgrimages, fasts and hundreds of thousands of techniques of austere self-discipline are found in the dust of the feet of the Holy.
From whom are you trying to hide your actions? God sees all;
He is Ever-present. My God is totally pervading all places and interspaces. ||3||
True is His Empire, and True is His Command. True is His Seat of True Authority.
True is the Creative Power which He has created. True is the world which He has fashioned.
O Nanak, chant the True Name; I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him. ||4||16||86||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Make the effort, and chant the Lord's Name. O very fortunate ones, earn this wealth.
In the Society of the Saints, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, and wash off the filth of countless incarnations. ||1||
O my mind, chant and meditate on the Name of the Lord.
Enjoy the fruits of your mind's desires; all suffering and sorrow shall depart. ||Pause||
For His sake, you assumed this body; see God always with you.
God is pervading the water, the land and the sky; He sees all with His Glance of Grace. ||2||
The mind and body become spotlessly pure, enshrining love for the True Lord.
One who dwells upon the Feet of the Supreme Lord God has truly performed all meditations and austerities. ||3||
The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is a Gem, a Jewel, a Pearl.
The essence of intuitive peace and bliss is obtained, O servant Nanak, by singing the Glories of God. ||4||17||87||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
That is the essence of the scriptures, and that is a good omen, by which one comes to chant the Name of the Lord.
The Guru has given me the Wealth of the Lotus Feet of the Lord, and I, without shelter, have now obtained Shelter.
The True Capital, and the True Way of Life, comes by chanting His Glories, twenty-four hours a day.
Granting His Grace, God meets us, and we no longer die, or come or go in reincarnation. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the Lord, with single-minded love.
He is contained deep within each and every heart. He is always with you, as your Helper and Support. ||1||Pause||
How can I measure the happiness of meditating on the Lord of the Universe?
Those who taste it are satisfied and fulfilled; their souls know this Sublime Essence.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 036

In the Society of the Saints, God, the Beloved, the Forgiver, comes to dwell within the mind.
One who has served his God is the emperor of kings||2||
This is the time to speak and sing the Praise and the Glory of God, which brings the merit of millions of cleansing and purifying baths.
The tongue which chants these Praises is worthy; there is no charity equal to this.
Blessing us with His Glance of Grace, the Kind and Compassionate, All-powerful Lord comes to dwell within the mind and body.
My soul, body and wealth are His. Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||3||
One whom the Creator Lord has met and joined to Himself shall never again be separated.
The True Creator Lord breaks the bonds of His slave.
The doubter has been put back on the path; his merits and demerits have not been considered.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the One who is the Support of every heart. ||4||18||88||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
With your tongue, repeat the True Name, and your mind and body shall become pure.
Your mother and father and all your relations-without Him, there are none at all.
If God Himself bestows His Mercy, then He is not forgotten, even for an instant. ||1||
O my mind, serve the True One, as long as you have the breath of life.
Without the True One, everything is false; in the end, all shall perish. ||1||Pause||
My Lord and Master is Immaculate and Pure; without Him, I cannot even survive.
Within my mind and body, there is such a great hunger; if only someone would come and unite me with Him, O my mother!
I have searched the four corners of the world-without our Husband Lord, there is no other place of rest. ||2||
Offer your prayers to Him, who shall unite you with the Creator.
The True Guru is the Giver of the Naam; His Treasure is perfect and overflowing.
Forever and ever, praise the One, who has no end or limitation. ||3||
Praise God, the Nurturer and Cherisher; His Wondrous Ways are unlimited.
Forever and ever, worship and adore Him; this is the most wonderful wisdom.
O Nanak, God's Flavor is sweet to the minds and bodies of those who have such blessed destiny written on their foreheads. ||4||19||89||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Meet with the humble Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, and contemplate the True Name.
For the journey of the soul, gather those supplies which will go with you here and hereafter.
These are obtained from the Perfect Guru, when God bestows His Glance of Grace.
Those unto whom He is Merciful, receive His Grace. ||1||
O my mind, there is no other as great as the Guru.
I cannot imagine any other place. The Guru leads me to meet the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who go to see the Guru obtain all treasures.
Those whose minds are attached to the Guru's Feet are very fortunate, O my mother.
The Guru is the Giver, the Guru is All-powerful. The Guru is All-pervading, contained amongst all.
The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God. The Guru lifts up and saves those who are drowning. ||2||
How shall I praise the Guru, the All-powerful Cause of causes?
Those, upon whose foreheads the Guru has placed His Hand, remain steady and stable.
The Guru has led me to drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He has released me from the cycle of birth and death.
I serve the Guru, the Transcendent Lord, the Dispeller of fear; my suffering has been taken away. ||3||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 037

The True Guru is the Deep and Profound Ocean of Peace, the Destroyer of sin.
For those who serve their Guru, there is no punishment at the hands of the Messenger of Death.
There is none to compare with the Guru; I have searched and looked throughout the entire universe.
The True Guru has bestowed the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, the mind is filled with peace. ||4||20||90||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
People eat what they believe to be sweet, but it turns out to be bitter in taste.
They attach their affections to brothers and friends, uselessly engrossed in corruption.
They vanish without a moment's delay; without God's Name, they are stunned and amazed. ||1||
O my mind, attach yourself to the service of the True Guru.
Whatever is seen, shall pass away. Abandon the intellectualizations of your mind. ||1||Pause||
Like the mad dog running around in all directions,
the greedy person, unaware, consumes everything, edible and non-edible alike.
Engrossed in the intoxication of sexual desire and anger, people wander through reincarnation over and over again. ||2||
Maya has spread out her net, and in it, she has placed the bait.
The bird of desire is caught, and cannot find any escape, O my mother.
One who does not know the Lord who created him, comes and goes in reincarnation over and over again. ||3||
By various devices, and in so many ways, this world is enticed.
They alone are saved, whom the All-powerful, Infinite Lord protects.
The servants of the Lord are saved by the Love of the Lord. O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||21||91||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
The herdsman comes to the pasture lands-what good are his ostentatious displays here?
When your allotted time is up, you must go. Take care of your real hearth and home. ||1||
O mind, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and serve the True Guru with love.
Why do you take pride in trivial matters? ||1||Pause||
Like an overnight guest, you shall arise and depart in the morning.
Why are you so attached to your household? It is all like flowers in the garden. ||2||
Why do you say, “Mine, mine”? Look to God, who has given it to you.
It is certain that you must arise and depart, and leave behind your hundreds of thousands and millions. ||3||
Through 8.4 million incarnations you have wandered, to obtain this rare and precious human life.
O Nanak, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the day of departure is drawing near! ||4||22||92||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
As long as the soul-companion is with the body, it dwells in happiness.
But when the companion arises and departs, then the body-bride mingles with dust. ||1||
My mind has become detached from the world; it longs to see the Vision of God's Darshan.
Blessed is Your Place. ||1||Pause||
As long as the soul-husband dwells in the body-house, everyone greets you with respect.
But when the soul-husband arises and departs, then no one cares for you at all. ||2||
In this world of your parents' home, serve your Husband Lord; in the world beyond, in your in-laws' home, you shall dwell in peace.
Meeting with the Guru, be a sincere student of proper conduct, and suffering shall never touch you. ||3||
Everyone shall go to their Husband Lord. Everyone shall be given their ceremonial send-off after their marriage.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 038

O Nanak, blessed are the happy soul-brides, who are in love with their Husband Lord. ||4||23||93||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House:
The One Lord is the Doer, the Cause of causes, who has created the creation.
Meditate on the One, O my mind, who is the Support of all. ||1||
Meditate within your mind on the Guru's Feet.
Give up all your clever mental tricks, and lovingly attune yourself to the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
Suffering, agony and fear do not cling to one whose heart is filled with the GurMantra.
Trying millions of things, people have grown weary, but without the Guru, none have been saved. ||2||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, the mind is comforted and all sins depart.
I am a sacrifice to those who fall at the Feet of the Guru. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the True Name of the Lord comes to dwell in the mind.
Very fortunate are those, O Nanak, whose minds are filled with this love. ||4||24||94||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Gather in the Wealth of the Lord, worship the True Guru, and give up all your corrupt ways.
Meditate in remembrance on the Lord who created and adorned you, and you shall be saved. ||1||
O mind, chant the Name of the One, the Unique and Infinite Lord.
He gave you the praanaa, the breath of life, and your mind and body. He is the Support of the heart. ||1||Pause||
The world is drunk, engrossed in sexual desire, anger and egotism.
Seek the Sanctuary of the Saints, and fall at their feet; your suffering and darkness shall be removed. ||2||
Practice truth, contentment and kindness; this is the most excellent way of life.
One who is so blessed by the Formless Lord God renounces selfishness, and becomes the dust of all. ||3||
All that is seen is You, Lord, the expansion of the expanse.
Says Nanak, the Guru has removed my doubts; I recognize God in all. ||4||25||95||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
The whole world is engrossed in bad deeds and good deeds.
God's devotee is above both, but those who understand this are very rare. ||1||
Our Lord and Master is all-pervading everywhere.
What should I say, and what should I hear? O my Lord and Master, You are Great, All-powerful and All-knowing. ||1||Pause||
One who is influenced by praise and blame is not God's servant.
One who sees the essence of reality with impartial vision, O Saints, is very rare-one among millions. ||2||
People talk on and on about Him; they consider this to be praise of God.
But rare indeed is the Gurmukh, who is above this mere talk. ||3||
He is not concerned with deliverance or bondage.
Nanak has obtained the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||4||26||96||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:
Relying on Your Mercy, Dear Lord, I have indulged in sensual pleasures.
Like a foolish child, I have made mistakes. O Lord, You are my Father and Mother. ||1||
It is easy to speak and talk,
but it is difficult to accept Your Will. ||1||Pause||
I stand tall; You are my Strength. I know that You are mine.
Inside of all, and outside of all, You are our Self-sufficient Father. ||2||
O Father, I do not know-how can I know Your Way?

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 039

He frees us from bondage, O Saints, and saves us from possessiveness. ||3||
Becoming Merciful, my Lord and Master has ended my comings and goings in reincarnation.
Meeting with the Guru, Nanak has recognized the Supreme Lord God. ||4||27||97||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, First House:
Meeting with the humble beings, O Siblings of Destiny, the Messenger of Death is conquered.
The True Lord and Master has come to dwell within my mind; my Lord and Master has become Merciful.
Meeting with the Perfect True Guru, all my worldly entanglements have ended. ||1||
O my True Guru, I am a sacrifice to You.
I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. By the Pleasure of Your Will, You have blessed me with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who have served You with love are truly wise.
Those who have the Treasure of the Naam within emancipate others as well as themselves.
There is no other Giver as great as the Guru, who has given the gift of the soul. ||2||
Blessed and acclaimed is the coming of those who have met the Guru with loving faith.
Attuned to the True One, you shall obtain a place of honor in the Court of the Lord.
Greatness is in the Hands of the Creator; it is obtained by pre-ordained destiny. ||3||
True is the Creator, True is the Doer. True is our Lord and Master, and True is His Support.
So speak the Truest of the True. Through the True One, an intuitive and discerning mind is obtained.
Nanak lives by chanting and meditating on the One, who is pervading within and contained amongst all. ||4||28||98||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Worship the Guru, the Transcendent Lord, with your mind and body attuned to love.
The True Guru is the Giver of the soul; He gives Support to all.
Act according to the Instructions of the True Guru; this is the true philosophy.
Without being attuned to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all attachment to Maya is just dust. ||1||
O my friend, reflect upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har
. In the Saadh Sangat, He dwells within the mind, and one's works are brought to perfect fruition. ||1||Pause||
The Guru is All-powerful, the Guru is Infinite. By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is obtained.
The Guru is Imperceptible, Immaculate and Pure. There is no other as great as the Guru.
The Guru is the Creator, the Guru is the Doer. The Gurmukh obtains true glory.
Nothing is beyond the Guru; whatever He wishes comes to pass. ||2||
The Guru is the Sacred Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Wish-fulfilling Elysian Tree.
The Guru is the Fulfiller of the desires of the mind. The Guru is the Giver of the Name of the Lord, by which all the world is saved.
The Guru is All-powerful, the Guru is Formless; the Guru is Lofty, Inaccessible and Infinite.
The Praise of the Guru is so sublime-what can any speaker say? ||3||
All the rewards which the mind desires are with the True Guru.
One whose destiny is so pre-ordained, obtains the Wealth of the True Name.
Entering the Sanctuary of the True Guru, you shall never die again.
Nanak: may I never forget You, Lord. This soul, body and breath are Yours. ||4||29||99||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
O Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, listen: release comes only through the True Name.
Worship the Feet of the Guru. Let the Name of the Lord be your sacred shrine of pilgrimage.
Hereafter, you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord; there, even the homeless find a home. ||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 040

O Siblings of Destiny, service to the True Guru alone is True.
When the True Guru is pleased, we obtain the Perfect, Unseen, Unknowable Lord. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has bestowed the True Name.
Night and day, I praise the True One; I sing the Glorious Praises of the True One.
True is the food, and true are the clothes, of those who chant the True Name of the True One. ||2||
With each breath and morsel of food, do not forget the Guru, the Embodiment of Fulfillment.
None is seen to be as great as the Guru. Meditate on Him twenty-four hours a day.
As He casts His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name, the Treasure of Excellence. ||3||
The Guru and the Transcendent Lord are one and the same, pervading and permeating amongst all.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, meditate on the Naam.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Guru, who does not die, or come and go in reincarnation. ||4||30||100||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Siree Raag, First Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees:
I speak and chant His Praises, vibrating the of my mind. The more I know Him, the more I vibrate it.
The One, unto whom we vibrate and sing-how great is He, and where is His Place?
Those who speak of Him and praise Him-they all continue speaking of Him with love. ||1||
O Baba, the Lord Allah is Inaccessible and Infinite.
Sacred is His Name, and Sacred is His Place. He is the True Cherisher. ||1||Pause||
The extent of Your Command cannot be seen; no one knows how to write it.
Even if a hundred poets met together, they could not describe even a tiny bit of it.
No one has found Your Value; they all merely write what they have heard again and again. ||2||
The Pirs, the Prophets, the spiritual teachers, the faithful, the innocents and the martyrs,
the Shaikhs, the mystics, the Qazis, the Mullahs and the Dervishes at His Door
\-they are blessed all the more as they continue reading their prayers in praise to Him. ||3||
He seeks no advice when He builds; He seeks no advice when He destroys. He seeks no advice while giving or taking.
He alone knows His Creative Power; He Himself does all deeds.
He beholds all in His Vision. He gives to those with whom He is pleased. ||4||
His Place and His Name are not known, no one knows how great is His Name.
How great is that place where my Sovereign Lord dwells?
No one can reach it; whom shall I go and ask? ||5||
One class of people does not like the other, when one has been made great.
Greatness is only in His Great Hands; He gives to those with whom He is pleased.
By the Hukam of His Command, He Himself regenerates, without a moment's delay. ||6||
Everyone cries out, “More! More!”, with the idea of receiving.
How great should we call the Giver? His Gifts are beyond estimation.
O Nanak, there is no deficiency; Your Storehouses are filled to overflowing, age after age. ||7||1||
First Mehl:
All are brides of the Husband Lord; all decorate themselves for Him.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 041

But when the time comes to settle their accounts, their red robes are corrupt.
His Love is not obtained through hypocrisy. Her false coverings bring only ruin. ||1||
In this way, the Dear Husband Lord ravishes and enjoys His bride.
The happy soul-bride is pleasing to You, Lord; by Your Grace, You adorn her. ||1||Pause||
She is decorated with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; her mind and body belong to her Husband Lord.
With her palms pressed together, she stands, waiting on Him, and offers her True prayers to Him.
Dyed in the deep crimson of the Love of her Darling Lord, she dwells in the Fear of the True One. Imbued with His Love, she is dyed in the color of His Love. ||2||
She is said to be the hand-maiden of her Beloved Lord; His sweetheart surrenders to His Name.
True Love is never broken; she is united in Union with the True One.
Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, her mind is pierced through. I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||3||
That bride, who is absorbed into the True Guru, shall never become a widow.
Her Husband Lord is Beautiful; His Body is forever fresh and new. The True One does not die, and shall not go.
He continually enjoys His happy soul-bride; He casts His Gracious Glance of Truth upon her, and she abides in His Will. ||4||
The bride braids her hair with Truth; her clothes are decorated with His Love.
Like the essence of sandalwood, He permeates her consciousness, and the Temple of the Tenth Gate is opened.
The lamp of the Shabad is lit, and the Name of the Lord is her necklace. ||5||
She is the most beautiful among women; upon her forehead she wears the Jewel of the Lord's Love.
Her glory and her wisdom are magnificent; her love for the Infinite Lord is True.
Other than her Beloved Lord, she knows no man. She enshrines love for the True Guru. ||6||
Asleep in the darkness of the night, how shall she pass her life-night without her Husband?
Her limbs shall burn, her body shall burn, and her mind and wealth shall burn as well.
When the Husband does not enjoy His bride, then her youth passes away in vain. ||7||
The Husband is on the Bed, but the bride is asleep, and so she does not come to know Him.
While I am asleep, my Husband Lord is awake. Where can I go for advice?
The True Guru has led me to meet Him, and now I dwell in the Fear of God. O Nanak, His Love is always with me. ||8||2||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
O Lord, You are Your Own Glorious Praise. You Yourself speak it; You Yourself hear it and contemplate it.
You Yourself are the Jewel, and You are the Appraiser. You Yourself are of Infinite Value.
O True Lord, You are Honor and Glory; You Yourself are the Giver. ||1||
O Dear Lord, You are the Creator and the Cause.
If it is Your Will, please save and protect me; please bless me with the lifestyle of the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
You Yourself are the flawless diamond; You Yourself are the deep crimson color.
You Yourself are the perfect pearl; You Yourself are the devotee and the priest.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You are praised. In each and every heart, the Unseen is seen. ||2||
You Yourself are the ocean and the boat. You Yourself are this shore, and the one beyond.
O All-knowing Lord, You are the True Way. The Shabad is the Navigator to ferry us across.
One who does not fear God shall live in fear; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. ||3||
The Creator alone is seen to be Eternal; all others come and go.
Only You, Lord, are Immaculate and Pure. All others are bound up in worldly pursuits.
Those who are protected by the Guru are saved. They are lovingly attuned to the True Lord. ||4||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 042

Through the Shabad, they recognize the Dear Lord; through the Guru's Word, they are attuned to Truth.
Filth does not stick to the body of one who has secured a dwelling in his True Home.
When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name. Without the Name, who are our relatives? ||5||
Those who have realized the Truth are at peace throughout the four ages.
Subduing their egotism and desires, they keep the True Name enshrined in their hearts.
In this world, the only real profit is the Name of the One Lord; it is earned by contemplating the Guru. ||6||
Loading the Merchandise of the True Name, you shall gather in your profits forever with the Capital of Truth.
In the Court of the True One, you shall sit in truthful devotion and prayer.
Your account shall be settled with honor, in the Radiant Light of the Name of the Lord. ||7||
The Lord is said to be the Highest of the High; no one can perceive Him.
Wherever I look, I see only You. The True Guru has inspired me to see You.
The Divine Light within is revealed, O Nanak, through this intuitive understanding. ||8||3||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The fish did not notice the net in the deep and salty sea.
It was so clever and beautiful, but why was it so confident?
By its actions it was caught, and now death cannot be turned away from its head. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, just like this, see death hovering over your own heads!
People are just like this fish; unaware, the noose of death descends upon them. ||1||Pause||
The whole world is bound by death; without the Guru, death cannot be avoided.
Those who are attuned to Truth are saved; they renounce duality and corruption.
I am a sacrifice to those who are found to be Truthful in the True Court. ||2||
Think of the hawk preying on the birds, and the net in the hands of the hunter.
Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; the others are caught by the bait.
Without the Name, they are picked up and thrown away; they have no friends or companions. ||3||
God is said to be the Truest of the True; His Place is the Truest of the True.
Those who obey the True One-their minds abide in true meditation.
Those who become Gurmukh, and obtain spiritual wisdom-their minds and mouths are known to be pure. ||4||
Offer your most sincere prayers to the True Guru, so that He may unite you with your Best Friend.
Meeting your Best Friend, you shall find peace; the Messenger of Death shall take poison and die.
I dwell deep within the Name; the Name has come to dwell within my mind. ||5||
Without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness; without the Shabad, understanding is not obtained.
Through the Guru's Teachings, you shall be enlightened; remain absorbed in the Love of the True Lord.
Death does not go there; your light shall merge with the Light. ||6||
You are my Best Friend; You are All-knowing. You are the One who unites us with Yourself.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we praise You; You have no end or limitation.
Death does not reach that place, where the Infinite Word of the Guru's Shabad resounds. ||7||
By the Hukam of His Command, all are created. By His Command, actions are performed.
By His Command, all are subject to death; by His Command, they merge in Truth.
O Nanak, whatever pleases His Will comes to pass. Nothing is in the hands of these beings. ||8||4||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
If the mind is polluted, then the body is polluted, and the tongue is polluted as well.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 043

With false mouths, people speak falsehood. How can they be made pure?
Without the Holy Water of the Shabad, they are not cleansed. From the True One alone comes Truth. ||1||
O soul-bride, without virtue, what happiness can there be?
The Husband Lord enjoys her with pleasure and delight; she is at peace in the love of the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
When the Husband goes away, the bride suffers in the pain of separation,
like the fish in shallow water, crying for mercy.
As it pleases the Will of the Husband Lord, peace is obtained, when He Himself casts His Glance of Grace. ||2||
Praise your Husband Lord, together with your bridesmaids and friends.
The body is beautified, and the mind is fascinated. Imbued with His Love, we are enraptured.
Adorned with the Shabad, the beautiful bride enjoys her Husband with virtue. ||3||
The soul-bride is of no use at all, if she is evil and without virtue.
She does not find peace in this world or the next; she burns in falsehood and corruption.
Coming and going are very difficult for that bride who is abandoned and forgotten by her Husband Lord. ||4||
The beautiful soul-bride of the Husband Lord-by what sensual pleasures has she been doomed?
She is of no use to her Husband if she babbles in useless arguments.
At the Door of His Home, she finds no shelter; she is discarded for seeking other pleasures. ||5||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read their books, but they do not understand the real meaning.
They give instructions to others, and then walk away, but they deal in Maya themselves.
Speaking falsehood, they wander around the world, while those who remain true to the Shabad are excellent and exalted. ||6||
There are so many Pandits and astrologers who ponder over the Vedas.
They glorify their disputes and arguments, and in these controversies they continue coming and going.
Without the Guru, they are not released from their karma, although they speak and listen and preach and explain. ||7||
They all call themselves virtuous, but I have no virtue at all.
With the Lord as her Husband, the soul-bride is happy; I, too, love that God.
O Nanak, through the Shabad, union is obtained; there is no more separation. ||8||5||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
You may chant and meditate, practice austerities and self-restraint, and dwell at sacred shrines of pilgrimage;
you may give donations to charity, and perform good deeds, but without the True One, what is the use of it all?
As you plant, so shall you harvest. Without virtue, this human life passes away in vain. ||1||
O young bride, be a slave to virtue, and you shall find peace.
Renouncing wrongful actions, following the Guru's Teachings, you shall be absorbed into the Perfect One. ||1||Pause||
Without capital, the trader looks around in all four directions.
He does not understand his own origins; the merchandise remains within the door of his own house.
Without this commodity, there is great pain. The false are ruined by falsehood. ||2||
One who contemplates and appraises this Jewel day and night reaps new profits.
He finds the merchandise within his own home, and departs after arranging his affairs.
So trade with the true traders, and as Gurmukh, contemplate God. ||3||
In the Society of the Saints, He is found, if the Uniter unites us.
One whose heart is filled with His Infinite Light meets with Him, and shall never again be separated from Him.
True is his position; he abides in Truth, with love and affection for the True One. ||4||
One who understands himself finds the Mansion of the Lord's Presence within his own home.
Imbued with the True Lord, Truth is gathered in.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 044

God is known throughout the three worlds. True is the Name of the True One. ||5||
The wife who knows that her Husband Lord is always with her is very beautiful.
The soul-bride is called to the Mansion of the His Presence, and her Husband Lord ravishes her with love.
The happy soul-bride is true and good; she is fascinated by the Glories of her Husband Lord. ||6||
Wandering around and making mistakes, I climb the plateau; having climbed the plateau, I go up the mountain.
But now I have lost my way, and I am wandering around in the forest; without the Guru, I do not understand.
If I wander around forgetting God's Name, I shall continue coming and going in reincarnation, over and over again. ||7||
Go and ask the travellers, how to walk on the Path as His slave.
They know the Lord to be their King, and at the Door to His Home, their way is not blocked.
O Nanak, the One is pervading everywhere; there is no other at all. ||8||6||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Through the Guru, the Pure One is known, and the human body becomes pure as well.
The Pure, True Lord abides within the mind; He knows the pain of our hearts.
With intuitive ease, a great peace is found, and the arrow of death shall not strike you. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, filth is washed away by bathing in the Pure Water of the Name.
You alone are Perfectly Pure, O True Lord; all other places are filled with filth. ||1||Pause||
The Temple of the Lord is beautiful; it was made by the Creator Lord.
The sun and the moon are lamps of incomparably beautiful light. Throughout the three worlds, the Infinite Light is pervading.
In the shops of the city of the body, in the fortresses and in the huts, the True Merchandise is traded. ||2||
The ointment of spiritual wisdom is the destroyer of fear; through love, the Pure One is seen.
The mysteries of the seen and the unseen are all known, if the mind is kept centered and balanced.
If one finds such a True Guru, the Lord is met with intuitive ease. ||3||
He draws us to His Touchstone, to test our love and consciousness.
The counterfeit have no place there, but the genuine are placed in His Treasury.
Let your hopes and anxieties depart; thus pollution is washed away. ||4||
Everyone begs for happiness; no one asks for suffering.
But in the wake of happiness, there comes great suffering. The self-willed manmukhs do not understand this.
Those who see pain and pleasure as one and the same find peace; they are pierced through by the Shabad. ||5||
The Vedas proclaim, and the words of Vyaasa tell us,
that the silent sages, the servants of the Lord, and those who practice a life of spiritual discipline are attuned to the Naam, the Treasure of Excellence.
Those who are attuned to the True Name win the game of life; I am forever a sacrifice to them. ||6||
Those who do not have the Naam in their mouths are filled with pollution; they are filthy throughout the four ages.
Without loving devotion to God, their faces are blackened, and their honor is lost.
Those who have forgotten the Naam are plundered by evil; they weep and wail in dismay. ||7||
I searched and searched, and found God. In the Fear of God, I have been united in His Union.
Through self-realization, people dwell within the home of their inner being; egotism and desire depart.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Name of the Lord are immaculate and radiant. ||8||7||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Listen, O deluded and demented mind: hold tight to the Guru's Feet.
Chant and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; death will be afraid of you, and suffering shall depart.
The deserted wife suffers terrible pain. How can her Husband Lord remain with her forever? ||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 045

O Siblings of Destiny, I have no other place to go.
The Guru has given me the Treasure of the Wealth of the Naam; I am a sacrifice to Him. ||1||Pause||
The Guru's Teachings bring honor. Blessed is He-may I meet and be with Him!
Without Him, I cannot live, even for a moment. Without His Name, I die.
I am blind-may I never forget the Naam! Under His Protection, I shall reach my true home. ||2||
Those chaylaas, those devotees, whose spiritual teacher is blind, shall not find their place of rest.
Without the True Guru, the Name is not obtained. Without the Name, what is the use of it all?
People come and go, regretting and repenting, like crows in a deserted house. ||3||
Without the Name, the body suffers in pain; it crumbles like a wall of sand.
As long as Truth does not enter into the consciousness, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is not found.
Attuned to the Shabad, we enter our home, and obtain the Eternal State of Nirvaanaa. ||4||
I ask my Guru for His Advice, and I follow the Guru's Advice.
With the Shabads of Praise abiding in the mind, the pain of egotism is burnt away.
We are intuitively united with Him, and we meet the Truest of the True. ||5||
Those who are attuned to the Shabad are spotless and pure; they renounce sexual desire, anger, selfishness and conceit.
They sing the Praises of the Naam, forever and ever; they keep the Lord enshrined within their hearts.
How could we ever forget Him from our minds? He is the Support of all beings. ||6||
One who dies in the Shabad is beyond death, and shall never die again.
Through the Shabad, we find Him, and embrace love for the Name of the Lord.
Without the Shabad, the world is deceived; it dies and is reborn, over and over again. ||7||
All praise themselves, and call themselves the greatest of the great.
Without the Guru, one's self cannot be known. By merely speaking and listening, what is accomplished?
O Nanak, one who realizes the Shabad does not act in egotism. ||8||8||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Without her Husband, the soul-bride's youth and ornaments are useless and wretched.
She does not enjoy the pleasure of His Bed; without her Husband, her ornaments are absurd.
The discarded bride suffers terrible pain; her Husband does not come to the bed of her home. ||1||
O mind, meditate on the Lord, and find peace.
Without the Guru, love is not found. United with the Shabad, happiness is found. ||1||Pause||
Serving the Guru, she finds peace, and her Husband Lord adorns her with intuitive wisdom.
Truly, she enjoys the Bed of her Husband, through her deep love and affection.
As Gurmukh, she comes to know Him. Meeting with the Guru, she maintains a virtuous lifestyle. ||2||
Through Truth, meet your Husband Lord, O soul-bride. Enchanted by your Husband, enshrine love for Him.
Your mind and body shall blossom forth in Truth. The value of this cannot be described.
The soul-bride finds her Husband Lord in the home of her own being; she is purified by the True Name. ||3||
If the mind within the mind dies, then the Husband ravishes and enjoys His bride.
They are woven into one texture, like pearls on a necklace around the neck.
In the Society of the Saints, peace wells up; the Gurmukhs take the Support of the Naam. ||4||
In an instant, one is born, and in an instant, one dies. In an instant one comes, and in an instant one goes.
One who recognizes the Shabad merges into it, and is not afflicted by death.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 046

Our Lord and Master is Unweighable; He cannot be weighed. He cannot be found merely by talking. ||5||
The merchants and the traders have come; their profits are pre-ordained.
Those who practice Truth reap the profits, abiding in the Will of God.
With the Merchandise of Truth, they meet the Guru, who does not have a trace of greed. ||6||
As Gurmukh, they are weighed and measured, in the balance and the scales of Truth.
The enticements of hope and desire are quieted by the Guru, whose Word is True.
He Himself weighs with the scale; perfect is the weighing of the Perfect One. ||7||
No one is saved by mere talk and speech, nor by reading loads of books.
The body does not obtain purity without loving devotion to the Lord.
O Nanak, never forget the Naam; the Guru shall unite us with the Creator. ||8||9||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Meeting the Perfect True Guru, we find the jewel of meditative reflection.
Surrendering our minds to our Guru, we find universal love.
We find the wealth of liberation, and our demerits are erased. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom.
Go and ask Brahma, Naarad and Vyaas, the writer of the Vedas. ||1||Pause||
Know that from the vibration of the Word, we obtain spiritual wisdom and meditation. Through it, we speak the Unspoken.
He is the fruit-bearing Tree, luxuriantly green with abundant shade.
The rubies, jewels and emeralds are in the Guru's Treasury. ||2||
From the Guru's Treasury, we receive the Love of the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.
We gather in the True Merchandise, through the Perfect Grace of the Infinite.
The True Guru is the Giver of peace, the Dispeller of pain, the Destroyer of demons. ||3||
The terrifying world-ocean is difficult and dreadful; there is no shore on this side or the one beyond.
There is no boat, no raft, no oars and no boatman.
The True Guru is the only boat on this terrifying ocean. His Glance of Grace carries us across. ||4||
If I forget my Beloved, even for an instant, suffering overtakes me and peace departs.
Let that tongue be burnt in flames, which does not chant the Naam with love.
When the pitcher of the body bursts, there is terrible pain; those who are caught by the Minister of Death regret and repent. ||5||
Crying out, “Mine! Mine!”, they have departed, but their bodies, their wealth, and their wives did not go with them.
Without the Name, wealth is useless; deceived by wealth, they have lost their way.
So serve the True Lord; become Gurmukh, and speak the Unspoken. ||6||
Coming and going, people wander through reincarnation; they act according to their past actions.
How can one's pre-ordained destiny be erased? It is written in accordance with the Lord's Will.
Without the Name of the Lord, no one can be saved. Through the Guru's Teachings, we are united in His Union. ||7||
Without Him, I have no one to call my own. My soul and my breath of life belong to Him.
May my egotism and possessiveness be burnt to ashes, and my greed and egotistical pride consigned to the fire.
O Nanak, contemplating the Shabad, the Treasure of Excellence is obtained. ||8||10||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
O mind, love the Lord, as the lotus loves the water.
Tossed about by the waves, it still blossoms with love.
In the water, the creatures are created; outside of the water they die. ||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 047

O mind, how can you be saved without love?
God permeates the inner beings of the Gurmukhs. They are blessed with the treasure of devotion. ||1||Pause||
O mind, love the Lord, as the fish loves the water.
The more the water, the more the happiness, and the greater the peace of mind and body.
Without water, she cannot live, even for an instant. God knows the suffering of her mind. ||2||
O mind, love the Lord, as the song-bird loves the rain.
The pools are overflowing with water, and the land is luxuriantly green, but what are they to her, if that single drop of rain does not fall into her mouth?
By His Grace, she receives it; otherwise, because of her past actions, she gives her head. ||3||
O mind, love the Lord, as the water loves the milk.
The water, added to the milk, itself bears the heat, and prevents the milk from burning.
God unites the separated ones with Himself again, and blesses them with true greatness. ||4||
O mind, love the Lord, as the chakvee duck loves the sun.
She does not sleep, for an instant or a moment; the sun is so far away, but she thinks that it is near.
Understanding does not come to the self-willed manmukh. But to the Gurmukh, the Lord is always close. ||5||
The self-willed manmukhs make their calculations and plans, but only the actions of the Creator come to pass.
His Value cannot be estimated, even though everyone may wish to do so.
Through the Guru's Teachings, it is revealed. Meeting with the True One, peace is found. ||6||
True love shall not be broken, if the True Guru is met.
Obtaining the wealth of spiritual wisdom, the understanding of the three worlds is acquired.
So become a customer of merit, and do not forget the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||7||
Those birds which peck at the shore of the pool have played and have departed.
In a moment, in an instant, we too must depart. Our play is only for today or tomorrow.
But those whom You unite, Lord, are united with You; they obtain a seat in the Arena of Truth. ||8||
Without the Guru, love does not well up, and the filth of egotism does not depart.
One who recognizes within himself that, “He is me”, and who is pierced through by the Shabad, is satisfied.
When one becomes Gurmukh and realizes his own self, what more is there left to do or have done? ||9||
Why speak of union to those who are already united with the Lord? Receiving the Shabad, they are satisfied.
The self-willed manmukhs do not understand; separated from Him, they endure beatings.
O Nanak, there is only the one door to His Home; there is no other place at all. ||10||11||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs wander around, deluded and deceived. They find no place of rest.
Without the Guru, no one is shown the Way. Like the blind, they continue coming and going.
Having lost the treasure of spiritual wisdom, they depart, defrauded and plundered. ||1||
O Baba, Maya deceives with its illusion.
Deceived by doubt, the discarded bride is not received into the Lap of her Beloved. ||1||Pause||
The deceived bride wanders around in foreign lands; she leaves, and abandons her own home.
Deceived, she climbs the plateaus and mountains; her mind wavers in doubt.
Separated from the Primal Being, how can she meet with Him again? Plundered by pride, she cries out and bewails. ||2||
The Guru unites the separated ones with the Lord again, through the love of the Delicious Name of the Lord.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 048

Through truth and intuitive poise, great honor is obtained, with the Support of the Naam and the Glory of the Lord.
As it pleases You, Lord, please save and protect me. Without You, O my Husband Lord, who else is there for me? ||3||
Reading their books over and over again, people continue making mistakes; they are so proud of their religious robes.
But what is the use of bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, when the filth of stubborn pride is within the mind?
Other than the Guru, who can explain that within the mind is the Lord, the King, the Emperor? ||4||
The Treasure of the Lord's Love is obtained by the Gurmukh, who contemplates the essence of reality.
The bride eradicates her selfishness, and adorns herself with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Within her own home, she finds her Husband, through infinite love for the Guru. ||5||
Applying oneself to the service of the Guru, the mind is purified, and peace is obtained.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad abides within the mind, and egotism is eliminated from within.
The Treasure of the Naam is acquired, and the mind reaps the lasting profit. ||6||
If He grants His Grace, then we obtain it. We cannot find it by our own efforts.
Remain attached to the Feet of the Guru, and eradicate selfishness from within.
Attuned to Truth, you shall obtain the True One. ||7||
Everyone makes mistakes; only the Guru and the Creator are infallible.
One who instructs his mind with the Guru's Teachings comes to embrace love for the Lord.
O Nanak, do not forget the Truth; you shall receive the Infinite Word of the Shabad. ||8||12||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The enticing desire for Maya leads people to become emotionally attached to their children, relatives, households and spouses.
The world is deceived and plundered by riches, youth, greed and egotism.
The drug of emotional attachment has destroyed me, as it has destroyed the whole world. ||1||
O my Beloved, I have no one except You.
Without You, nothing else pleases me. Loving You, I am at peace. ||1||Pause||
I sing the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with love; I am content with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Whatever is seen shall pass away. So do not be attached to this false show.
Like a traveller in his travels, you have come. Behold the caravan leaving each day. ||2||
Many preach sermons, but without the Guru, understanding is not obtained.
If someone receives the Glory of the Naam, he is attuned to truth and blessed with honor.
Those who are pleasing to You are good; no one is counterfeit or genuine. ||3||
In the Guru's Sanctuary we are saved. The assets of the self-willed manmukhs are false.
The eight metals of the King are made into coins by the Word of His Shabad.
The Assayer Himself assays them, and He places the genuine ones in His Treasury. ||4||
Your Value cannot be appraised; I have seen and tested everything.
By speaking, His Depth cannot be found. Abiding in truth, honor is obtained.
Through the Guru's Teachings, I praise You; otherwise, I cannot describe Your Value. ||5||
That body which does not appreciate the Naam-that body is infested with egotism and conflict.
Without the Guru, spiritual wisdom is not obtained; other tastes are poison.
Without virtue, nothing is of any use. The taste of Maya is bland and insipid. ||6||
Through desire, people are cast into the womb and reborn. Through desire, they taste the sweet and sour flavors.
Bound by desire, they are led on, beaten and struck on their faces and mouths.
Bound and gagged and assaulted by evil, they are released only through the Name, through the Guru's Teachings. ||7||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 049

In all places, You are the One and Only. As it pleases You, Lord, please save and protect me!
Through the Guru's Teachings, the True One abides within the mind. The Companionship of the Naam brings the most excellent honor.
Eradicate the disease of egotism, and chant the True Shabad, the Word of the True Lord. ||8||
You are pervading throughout the Akaashic Ethers, the nether regions and the three worlds.
You Yourself are bhakti, loving devotional worship. You Yourself unite us in Union with Yourself.
O Nanak, may I never forget the Naam! As is Your Pleasure, so is Your Will. ||9||13||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
My mind is pierced through by the Name of the Lord. What else should I contemplate?
Focusing your awareness on the Shabad, happiness wells up. Attuned to God, the most excellent peace is found.
As it pleases You, please save me, Lord. The Name of the Lord is my Support. ||1||
O mind, the Will of our Lord and Master is true.
Focus your love upon the One who created and adorned your body and mind. ||1||Pause||
If I cut my body into pieces, and burn them in the fire,
and if I make my body and mind into firewood, and night and day burn them in the fire,
and if I perform hundreds of thousands and millions of religious rituals-still, all these are not equal to the Name of the Lord. ||2||
If my body were cut in half, if a saw was put to my head,
and if my body were frozen in the Himalayas-even then, my mind would not be free of disease.
None of these are equal to the Name of the Lord. I have seen and tried and tested them all. ||3||
If I made a donation of castles of gold, and gave lots of fine horses and wondrous elephants in charity,
and if I made donations of land and cows-even then, pride and ego would still be within me.
The Name of the Lord has pierced my mind; the Guru has given me this true gift. ||4||
There are so many stubborn-minded intelligent people, and so many who contemplate the Vedas.
There are so many entanglements for the soul. Only as Gurmukh do we find the Gate of Liberation.
Truth is higher than everything; but higher still is truthful living. ||5||
Call everyone exalted; no one seems lowly.
The One Lord has fashioned the vessels, and His One Light pervades the three worlds.
Receiving His Grace, we obtain Truth. No one can erase His Primal Blessing. ||6||
When one Holy person meets another Holy person, they abide in contentment, through the Love of the Guru.
They contemplate the Unspoken Speech, merging in absorption in the True Guru.
Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, they are contented; they go to the Court of the Lord in robes of honor. ||7||
In each and every heart the Music of the Lord's Flute vibrates, night and day, with sublime love for the Shabad.
Only those few who become Gurmukh understand this by instructing their minds.
O Nanak, do not forget the Naam. Practicing the Shabad you shall be saved. ||8||14||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
There are painted mansions to behold, white-washed, with beautiful doors;
they were constructed to give pleasure to the mind, but this is only for the sake of the love of duality.
The inner being is empty without love. The body shall crumble into a heap of ashes. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, this body and wealth shall not go along with you.
The Lord's Name is the pure wealth; through the Guru, God bestows this gift. ||1||Pause||
The Lord's Name is the pure wealth; it is given only by the Giver.
One who has the Guru, the Creator, as his Friend, shall not be questioned hereafter.
He Himself delivers those who are delivered. He Himself is the Forgiver. ||2||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 050

The self-willed manmukh looks upon his daughters, sons and relatives as his own.
Gazing upon his wife, he is pleased. But along with happiness, they bring grief.
The Gurmukhs are attuned to the Word of the Shabad. Day and night, they enjoy the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||3||
The consciousness of the wicked, faithless cynics wanders around in search of transitory wealth, unstable and distracted.
Searching outside of themselves, they are ruined; the object of their search is in that sacred place within the home of the heart.
The self-willed manmukhs, in their ego, miss it; the Gurmukhs receive it in their laps. ||4||
You worthless, faithless cynic-recognize your own origin!
This body is made of blood and semen. It shall be consigned to the fire in the end.
The body is under the power of the breath, according to the True Sign inscribed upon your forehead. ||5||
Everyone begs for a long life-no one wishes to die.
A life of peace and comfort comes to that Gurmukh, within whom God dwells.
Without the Naam, what good those who do not have the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of the Lord and Guru? ||6||
In their dreams at night, people wander around as long as they sleep;
just so, they are under the power of the snake Maya, as long as their hearts are filled with ego and duality.
Through the Guru's Teachings, they come to understand and see that this world is just a dream. ||7||
As thirst is quenched with water, and the baby is satisfied with mother's milk,
and as the lotus does not exist without water, and as the fish dies without water
\-O Nanak, so does the Gurmukh live, receiving the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||8||15||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Beholding the terrifying mountain in this world of my father's home, I am terrified.
It is so difficult to climb this high mountain; there is no ladder which reaches up there.
But as Gurmukh, I know that it is within my self; the Guru has brought me to Union, and so I cross over. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, the terrifying world-ocean is so difficult to cross-I am terrified!
The Perfect True Guru, in His Pleasure, has met with me; the Guru has saved me, through the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
I may say, “I am going, I am going”, but I know that, in the end, I must really go.
Whoever comes must also go. Only the Guru and the Creator are Eternal.
So praise the True One continually, and love His Place of Truth. ||2||
Beautiful gates, houses and palaces, solidly built forts,
elephants, saddled horses, hundreds of thousands of uncounted armies
\-none of these will go along with anyone in the end, and yet, the fools bother themselves to exhaustion with these, and then die. ||3||
You may gather gold and sliver, but wealth is just a net of entanglement.
You may beat the drum and proclaim authority over the whole world, but without the Name, death hovers over your head.
When the body falls, the play of life is over; what shall be the condition of the evil-doers then? ||4||
The husband is delighted seeing his sons, and his wife upon his bed.
He applies sandalwood and scented oils, and dresses himself in his beautiful clothes.
But dust shall mix with dust, and he shall depart, leaving hearth and home behind. ||5||
He may be called a chief, an emperor, a king, a governor or a lord;
he may present himself as a leader or a chief, but this just burns him in the fire of egotistical pride.
The self-willed manmukh has forgotten the Naam. He is like straw, burning in the forest fire. ||6||
Whoever comes into the world and indulges in ego, must depart.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 051

The whole world is a store-house of lamp-black; the body and mind are blackened with it.
Those who are saved by the Guru are immaculate and pure; through the Word of the Shabad, they extinguish the fire of desire. ||7||
O Nanak, they swim across with the True Name of the Lord, the King above the heads of kings.
May I never forget the Name of the Lord! I have purchased the Jewel of the Lord's Name.
The self-willed manmukhs putrefy and die in the terrifying world-ocean, while the Gurmukhs cross over the bottomless ocean. ||8||16||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Second House:
They have made this their resting place and they sit at home, but the urge to depart is always there.
This would be known as a lasting place of rest, only if they were to remain stable and unchanging. ||1||
What sort of a resting place is this world?
Doing deeds of faith, pack up the supplies for your journey, and remain committed to the Name. ||1||Pause||
The Yogis sit in their Yogic postures, and the Mullahs sit at their resting stations.
The Hindu Pandits recite from their books, and the Siddhas sit in the temples of their gods. ||2||
The angels, Siddhas, worshippers of Shiva, heavenly musicians, silent sages, Saints, priests, preachers, spiritual teachers and commanders
\-each and every one has left, and all others shall depart as well. ||3||
The sultans and kings, the rich and the mighty, have marched away in succession.
In a moment or two, we shall also depart. O my heart, understand that you must go as well! ||4||
This is described in the Shabads; only a few understand this!
Nanak offers this prayer to the One who pervades the water, the land and the air. ||5||
He is Allah, the Unknowable, the Inaccessible, All-powerful and Merciful Creator.
All the world comes and goes-only the Merciful Lord is permanent. ||6||
Call permanent only the One, who does not have destiny inscribed upon His Forehead.
The sky and the earth shall pass away; He alone is permanent. ||7||
The day and the sun shall pass away; the night and the moon shall pass away; the hundreds of thousands of stars shall disappear.
He alone is permanent; Nanak speaks the Truth. ||8||17||
Seventeen Ashtapadees Of The First Mehl.
Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
By God's Grace, the Gurmukh practices devotion; without the Guru, there is no devotional worship.
One who merges his own self into Him understands, and so becomes pure.
The Dear Lord is True, and True is the Word of His Bani. Through the Word of the Shabad, Union with Him is obtained. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, without devotion, why have people even come into the world?
They have not served the Perfect Guru; they have wasted their lives in vain. ||1||Pause||
The Lord Himself, the Life of the World, is the Giver. He Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself.
What are these poor beings and creatures? What can they speak and say?
God Himself grants glory to the Gurmukhs; He joins them to His Service. ||2||
Beholding your family, you are lured away by emotional attachment, but when you leave, they will not go with you.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 052

Serving the True Guru, I have found the Treasure of Excellence. Its value cannot be estimated.
The Dear Lord God is my Best Friend. In the end, He shall be my Companion and Support. ||3||
In this world of my father's home, the Great Giver is the Life of the World. The self-willed manmukhs have lost their honor.
Without the True Guru, no one knows the Way. The blind find no place of rest.
If the Lord, the Giver of Peace, does not dwell within the mind, then they shall depart with regret in the end. ||4||
In this world of my father's house, through the Guru's Teachings, I have cultivated within my mind the Great Giver, the Life of the World.
Night and day, performing devotional worship, day and night, ego and emotional attachment are removed.
And then, attuned to Him, we become like Him, truly absorbed in the True One. ||5||
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He gives us His Love, and we contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Serving the True Guru, intuitive peace wells up, and ego and desire die.
The Lord, the Giver of Virtue, dwells forever within the minds of those who keep Truth enshrined within their hearts. ||6||
My God is forever Immaculate and Pure; with a pure mind, He can be found.
If the Treasure of the Name of the Lord abides within the mind, egotism and pain are totally eliminated.
The True Guru has instructed me in the Word of the Shabad. I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||7||
Within your own conscious mind, you may say anything, but without the Guru, selfishness and conceit are not eradicated.
The Dear Lord is the Lover of His devotees, the Giver of Peace. By His Grace, He abides within the mind.
O Nanak, God blesses us with the sublime awakening of consciousness; He Himself grants glorious greatness to the Gurmukh. ||8||1||18||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who go around acting in egotism are struck down by the Messenger of Death with his club.
Those who serve the True Guru are uplifted and saved, in love with the Lord. ||1||
O mind, become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Those who are so pre-destined by the Creator are absorbed into the Naam, through the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||
Without the True Guru, faith does not come, and love for the Naam is not embraced.
Even in dreams, they find no peace; they sleep immersed in pain. ||2||
Even if you chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with great longing, your past actions are still not erased.
The Lord's devotees surrender to His Will; those devotees are accepted at His Door. ||3||
The Guru has lovingly implanted the Word of His Shabad within me. Without His Grace, it cannot be attained.
Even if the poisonous plant is watered with ambrosial nectar a hundred times, it will still bear poisonous fruit. ||4||
Those humble beings who are in love with the True Guru are pure and true.
They act in harmony with the Will of the True Guru; they shed the poison of ego and corruption. ||5||
Acting in stubborn-mindedness, no one is saved; go and study the Simritees and the Shaastras.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and practicing the Shabads of the Guru, you shall be saved. ||6||
The Name of the Lord is the Treasure, which has no end or limitation.
The Gurmukhs are beauteous; the Creator has blessed them with His Mercy. ||7||
O Nanak, the One Lord alone is the Giver; there is no other at all.
By Guru's Grace, He is obtained. By His Mercy, He is found. ||8||2||19||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 053

Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The soul-bird in the beautiful tree of the body pecks at Truth, with love for the Guru.
She drinks in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and abides in intuitive ease; she does not fly around coming and going.
She obtains her home within her own heart; she is absorbed into the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
O mind, work to serve the Guru.
If you walk in harmony with the Guru's Will, you shall remain immersed in the Lord's Name, night and day. ||1||Pause||
The birds in the beautiful trees fly around in all four directions.
The more they fly around, the more they suffer; they burn and cry out in pain.
Without the Guru, they do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and they do not obtain the Ambrosial Fruit. ||2||
The Gurmukh is like God's tree, always green, blessed with the Sublime Love of the True One, with intuitive peace and poise.
He cuts off the three branches of the three qualities, and embraces love for the One Word of the Shabad.
The Lord alone is the Ambrosial Fruit; He Himself gives it to us to eat. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs stand there and dry up; they do not bear any fruit, and they do not provide any shade.
Don't even bother to sit near them-they have no home or village.
They are cut down and burnt each day; they have neither the Shabad, nor the Lord's Name. ||4||
According to the Lord's Command, people perform their actions; they wander around, driven by the karma of their past actions.
By the Lord's Command, they behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Wherever He sends them, there they go.
By His Command, the Lord, Har, Har, abides within our minds; by His Command we merge in Truth. ||5||
The wretched fools do not know the Lord's Will; they wander around making mistakes.
They go about their business stubborn-mindedly; they are disgraced forever and ever.
Inner peace does not come to them; they do not embrace love for the True Lord. ||6||
Beautiful are the faces of the Gurmukhs, who bear love and affection for the Guru.
Through true devotional worship, they are attuned to Truth; at the True Door, they are found to be true.
Blessed is their coming into being; they redeem all their ancestors. ||7||
All do their deeds under the Lord's Glance of Grace; no one is beyond His Vision.
According to the Glance of Grace with which the True Lord beholds us, so do we become.
O Nanak, the Glorious Greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is received only by His Mercy. ||8||3||20||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam; the self-willed manmukhs do not understand.
The faces of the Gurmukhs are always radiant; the Lord has come to dwell within their minds.
Through intuitive understanding they are at peace, and through intuitive understanding they remain absorbed in the Lord. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, be the slaves of the Lord's slaves.
Service to the Guru is worship of the Guru. How rare are those who obtain it! ||1||Pause||
The happy soul-bride is always with her Husband Lord, if she walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
She attains her Eternal, Ever-stable Husband, who never dies or goes away.
United with the Word of the Shabad, she shall not be separated again. She is immersed in the Lap of her Beloved. ||2||
The Lord is Immaculate and Radiantly Bright; without the Guru, He cannot be found.
He cannot be understood by reading scriptures; the deceitful pretenders are deluded by doubt.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is always found, and the tongue is permeated with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||3||
Emotional attachment to Maya is shed with intuitive ease, through the Guru's Teachings.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 054

Without the Shabad, the world wanders lost in pain. The self-willed manmukh is consumed.
Through the Shabad, meditate on the Naam; through the Shabad, you shall merge in Truth. ||4||
The Siddhas wander around, deluded by Maya; they are not absorbed in the Samaadhi of the Lord's Sublime Love.
The three worlds are permeated by Maya; they are totally covered by it.
Without the Guru, liberation is not attained, and the double-mindedness of Maya does not go away. ||5||
What is called Maya? What does Maya do?
These beings are bound by pleasure and pain; they do their deeds in egotism.
Without the Shabad, doubt is not dispelled, and egotism is not eliminated from within. ||6||
Without love, there is no devotional worship. Without the Shabad, no one finds acceptance.
Through the Shabad, egotism is conquered and subdued, and the illusion of Maya is dispelled.
The Gurmukh obtains the Treasure of the Naam with intuitive ease. ||7||
Without the Guru, one's virtues do not shine forth; without virtue, there is no devotional worship.
The Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He abides within their minds. They meet that God with intuitive ease.
O Nanak, through the Shabad, praise the Lord. By His Grace, He is obtained. ||8||4||21||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Emotional attachment to Maya is created by my God; He Himself misleads us through illusion and doubt.
The self-willed manmukhs perform their actions, but they do not understand; they waste away their lives in vain.
Gurbani is the Light to illuminate this world; by His Grace, it comes to abide within the mind. ||1||
O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and find peace.
Praising the Perfect Guru, you shall easily meet with that God. ||1||Pause||
Doubt departs, and fear runs away, when you focus your consciousness on the Lord's Feet.
The Gurmukh practices the Shabad, and the Lord comes to dwell within the mind.
In the mansion of the home within the self, we merge in Truth, and the Messenger of Death cannot devour us. ||2||
Naam Dayv the printer, and Kabeer the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru.
Those who know God and recognize His Shabad lose their ego and class consciousness.
Their Banis are sung by the angelic beings, and no one can erase them, O Siblings of Destiny! ||3||
The demon's son Prahlaad had not read about religious rituals or ceremonies, austerity or self-discipline; he did not know the love of duality.
Upon meeting with the True Guru, he became pure; night and day, he chanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
He read only of the One and he understood only the One Name; he knew no other at all. ||4||
The followers of the six different life-styles and world-views, the Yogis and the Sanyaasees have gone astray in doubt without the Guru.
If they serve the True Guru, they find the state of salvation; they enshrine the Dear Lord within their minds.
They focus their consciousness on the True Bani, and their comings and goings in reincarnation are over. ||5||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read and argue and stir up controversies, but without the Guru, they are deluded by doubt.
They wander around the cycle of 8.4 million reincarnations; without the Shabad, they do not attain liberation.
But when they remember the Name, then they attain the state of salvation, when the True Guru unites them in Union. ||6||
In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the Name of the Lord wells up, when the True Guru unites us in His Sublime Love.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 055

I offer my mind and body, and I renounce my selfishness and conceit; I walk in Harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
I am forever a sacrifice to my Guru, who has attached my consciousness to the Lord. ||7||
He alone is a Brahmin, who knows the Lord Brahma, and is attuned to the Love of the Lord.
God is close at hand; He dwells deep within the hearts of all. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, know Him.
O Nanak, through the Naam, greatness is obtained; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized. ||8||5||22||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Everyone longs to be centered and balanced, but without the Guru, no one can.
The Pandits and the astrologers read and read until they grow weary, while the fanatics are deluded by doubt.
Meeting with the Guru, intuitive balance is obtained, when God, in His Will, grants His Grace. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru, intuitive balance is not obtained.
Through the Word of the Shabad, intuitive peace and poise wells up, and that True Lord is obtained. ||1||Pause||
That which is sung intuitively is acceptable; without this intuition, all chanting is useless.
In the state of intuitive balance, devotion wells up. In intuitive balance, love is balanced and detached.
In the state of intuitive balance, peace and tranquility are produced. Without intuitive balance, life is useless. ||2||
In the state of intuitive balance, praise the Lord forever and ever. With intuitive ease, embrace Samaadhi.
In the state of intuitive balance, chant His Glories, lovingly absorbed in devotional worship.
Through the Shabad, the Lord dwells within the mind, and the tongue tastes the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||3||
In the poise of intuitive balance, death is destroyed, entering the Sanctuary of the True One.
Intuitively balanced, the Name of the Lord dwells within the mind, practicing the lifestyle of Truth.
Those who have found Him are very fortunate; they remain intuitively absorbed in Him. ||4||
Within Maya, the poise of intuitive balance is not produced. Maya leads to the love of duality.
The self-willed manmukhs perform religious rituals, but they are burnt down by their selfishness and conceit.
Their births and deaths do not cease; over and over again, they come and go in reincarnation. ||5||
In the three qualities, intuitive balance is not obtained; the three qualities lead to delusion and doubt.
What is the point of reading, studying and debating, if one loses his roots?
In the fourth state, there is intuitive balance; the Gurmukhs gather it in. ||6||
The Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord, is the treasure. Through intuitive balance, understanding is obtained.
The virtuous praise the True One; their reputation is true.
The wayward are united with God through intuitive balance; through the Shabad, union is obtained. ||7||
Without intuitive balance, all are blind. Emotional attachment to Maya is utter darkness.
In intuitive balance, understanding of the True, Infinite Shabad is obtained.
Granting forgiveness, the Perfect Guru unites us with the Creator. ||8||
In intuitive balance, the Unseen is recognized-the Fearless, Luminous, Formless Lord.
There is only the One Giver of all beings. He blends our light with His Light.
So praise God through the Perfect Word of His Shabad; He has no end or limitation. ||9||
Those who are wise take the Naam as their wealth; with intuitive ease, they trade with Him.
Night and day, they receive the Profit of the Lord's Name, which is an inexhaustible and over-flowing treasure.
O Nanak, when the Great Giver gives, nothing at all is lacking. ||10||6||23||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 056

Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Meeting with the True Guru, you shall not have to go through the cycle of reincarnation again; the pains of birth and death will be taken away.
Through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, all understanding is obtained; remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O my mind, focus your consciousness on the True Guru.
The Immaculate Naam itself, ever-fresh, comes to abide within the mind. ||1||Pause||
O Dear Lord, please protect and preserve me in Your Sanctuary. As You keep me, so do I remain.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Gurmukh remains dead while yet alive, and swims across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
By great good fortune, the Name is obtained. Following the Guru's Teachings, through the Shabad, you shall be exalted.
God, the Creator Himself, dwells within the mind; remain absorbed in the state of intuitive balance. ||3||
Some are self-willed manmukhs; they do not love the Word of the Shabad. Bound in chains, they wander lost in reincarnation.
Through 8.4 million lifetimes, they wander over and over again; they waste away their lives in vain. ||4||
In the minds of the devotees there is bliss; they are attuned to the Love of the True Word of the Shabad.
Night and day, they constantly sing the Glories of the Immaculate Lord; with intuitive ease, they are absorbed into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||5||
The Gurmukhs speak the Ambrosial Bani; they recognize the Lord, the Supreme Soul in all.
They serve the One; they worship and adore the One. The Gurmukhs speak the Unspoken Speech. ||6||
The Gurmukhs serve their True Lord and Master, who comes to dwell in the mind.
They are forever attuned to the Love of the True One, who bestows His Mercy and unites them with Himself. ||7||
He Himself does, and He Himself causes others to do; He wakes some from their sleep.
He Himself unites us in Union; Nanak is absorbed in the Shabad. ||8||7||24||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Serving the True Guru, the mind becomes immaculate, and the body becomes pure.
The mind obtains bliss and eternal peace, meeting with the Deep and Profound Lord.
Sitting in the Sangat, the True Congregation, the mind is comforted and consoled by the True Name. ||1||
O mind, serve the True Guru without hesitation.
Serving the True Guru, the Lord abides within the mind, and no trace of filth shall attach itself to you. ||1||Pause||
From the True Word of the Shabad comes honor. True is the Name of the True One.
I am a sacrifice to those who conquer their ego and recognize the Lord.
The self-willed manmukhs do not know the True One; they find no shelter, and no place of rest anywhere. ||2||
Those who take the Truth as their food and the Truth as their clothing, have their home in the True One.
They constantly praise the True One, and in the True Word of the Shabad they have their dwelling.
They recognize the Lord, the Supreme Soul in all, and through the Guru's Teachings they dwell in the home of their own inner self. ||3||
They see the Truth, and they speak the Truth; their bodies and minds are True.
True are their teachings, and True are their instructions; True are the reputations of the true ones.
Those who have forgotten the True One are miserable-they depart weeping and wailing. ||4||
Those who have not served the True Guru-why did they even bother to come into the world?
They are bound and gagged and beaten at Death's door, but no one hears their shrieks and cries.
They waste their lives uselessly; they die and are reincarnated over and over again. ||5||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 057

Seeing this world on fire, I rushed to the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
The True Guru has implanted the Truth within me; I dwell steadfastly in Truth and self-restraint.
The True Guru is the Boat of Truth; in the Word of the Shabad, we cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||6||
People continue wandering through the cycle of 8.4 million incarnations; without the True Guru, liberation is not obtained.
Reading and studying, the Pandits and the silent sages have grown weary, but attached to the love of duality, they have lost their honor.
The True Guru teaches the Word of the Shabad; without the True One, there is no other at all. ||7||
Those who are linked by the True One are linked to Truth. They always act in Truth.
They attain their dwelling in the home of their own inner being, and they abide in the Mansion of Truth.
O Nanak, the devotees are happy and peaceful forever. They are absorbed in the True Name. ||8||17||8||25||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
When you are confronted with terrible hardships, and no one offers you any support,
when your friends turn into enemies, and even your relatives have deserted you,
and when all support has given way, and all hope has been lost
\-if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, even the hot wind shall not touch you. ||1||
Our Lord and Master is the Power of the powerless.
He does not come or go; He is Eternal and Permanent. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is known as True. ||1||Pause||
If you are weakened by the pains of hunger and poverty,
with no money in your pockets, and no one will give you any comfort,
and no one will satisfy your hopes and desires, and none of your works is accomplished
\-if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall obtain the eternal kingdom. ||2||
When you are plagued by great and excessive anxiety, and diseases of the body;
when you are wrapped up in the attachments of household and family, sometimes feeling joy, and then other times sorrow;
when you are wandering around in all four directions, and you cannot sit or sleep even for a moment
\-if you come to remember the Supreme Lord God, then your body and mind shall be cooled and soothed. ||3||
When you are under the power of sexual desire, anger and worldly attachment, or a greedy miser in love with your wealth;
if you have committed the four great sins and other mistakes; even if you are a murderous fiend
who has never taken the time to listen to sacred books, hymns and poetry
\-if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, and contemplate Him, even for a moment, you shall be saved. ||4||
People may recite by heart the Shaastras, the Simritees and the four Vedas;
they may be ascetics, great, self-disciplined Yogis; they may visit sacred shrines of pilgrimage
and perform the six ceremonial rituals, over and over again, performing worship services and ritual bathings.
Even so, if they have not embraced love for the Supreme Lord God, then they shall surely go to hell. ||5||
You may possess empires, vast estates, authority over others, and the enjoyment of myriads of pleasures;
you may have delightful and beautiful gardens, and issue unquestioned commands;
you may have enjoyments and entertainments of all sorts and kinds, and continue to enjoy exciting pleasures
\-and yet, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall be reincarnated as a snake. ||6||
You may possess vast riches, maintain virtuous conduct, have a spotless reputation and observe religious customs;
you may have the loving affections of mother, father, children, siblings and friends;
you may have armies well-equipped with weapons, and all may salute you with respect;

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 058

But still, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, then you shall be taken and consigned to the most hideous hell! ||7||
You may have a body free of disease and deformity, and have no worries or grief at all;
you may be unmindful of death, and night and day revel in pleasures;
you may take everything as your own, and have no fear in your mind at all;
but still, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall fall under the power of the Messenger of Death. ||8||
The Supreme Lord showers His Mercy, and we find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The more time we spend there, the more we come to love the Lord.
The Lord is the Master of both worlds; there is no other place of rest.
When the True Guru is pleased and satisfied, O Nanak, the True Name is obtained. ||9||1||26||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House:
I do not know what pleases my Lord.
O mind, seek out the way! ||1||Pause||
The meditatives practice meditation,
and the wise practice spiritual wisdom,
but how rare are those who know God! ||1||
The worshipper of Bhagaauti practices self-discipline,
the Yogi speaks of liberation,
and the ascetic is absorbed in asceticism. ||2||
The men of silence observe silence,
the Sanyaasees observe celibacy,
and the Udaasees abide in detachment. ||3||
There are nine forms of devotional worship.
The Pandits recite the Vedas.
The householders assert their faith in family life. ||4||
Those who utter only One Word, those who take many forms, the naked renunciates,
the wearers of patched coats, the magicians, those who remain always awake,
and those who bathe at holy places of pilgrimage-||5||
Those who go without food, those who never touch others,
the hermits who never show themselves,
and those who are wise in their own minds-||6||
Of these, no one admits to any deficiency;
all say that they have found the Lord.
But he alone is a devotee, whom the Lord has united with Himself. ||7||
Abandoning all devices and contrivances, I have sought His Sanctuary.
Nanak has fallen at the Feet of the Guru. ||8||2||27||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Third House:
Among Yogis, You are the Yogi;
among pleasure seekers, You are the Pleasure Seeker.
Your limits are not known to any of the beings in the heavens, in this world, or in the nether regions of the underworld. ||1||
I am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to Your Name. ||1||Pause||
You created the world,
and assigned tasks to one and all.
You watch over Your Creation, and through Your All-powerful Creative Potency, You cast the dice. ||2||
You are manifest in the Expanse of Your Workshop.
Everyone longs for Your Name,
but without the Guru, no one finds You. All are enticed and trapped by Maya. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.
Meeting Him, the supreme status is obtained.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 059

The angelic beings and the silent sages long for Him; the True Guru has given me this understanding. ||4||
How is the Society of the Saints to be known?
There, the Name of the One Lord is chanted.
The One Name is the Lord's Command; O Nanak, the True Guru has given me this understanding. ||5||
This world has been deluded by doubt.
You Yourself, Lord, have led it astray.
The discarded soul-brides suffer in terrible agony; they have no luck at all. ||6||
What are the signs of the discarded brides?
They miss their Husband Lord, and they wander around in dishonor.
The clothes of those brides are filthy-they pass their life-night in agony. ||7||
What actions have the happy soul-brides performed?
They have obtained the fruit of their pre-ordained destiny.
Casting His Glance of Grace, the Lord unites them with Himself. ||8||
Those, whom God causes to abide by His Will,
have the Shabad of His Word abiding deep within.
They are the true soul-brides, who embrace love for their Husband Lord. ||9||
Those who take pleasure in God's Will
remove doubt from within.
O Nanak, know Him as the True Guru, who unites all with the Lord. ||10||
Meeting with the True Guru, they receive the fruits of their destiny,
and egotism is driven out from within.
The pain of evil-mindedness is eliminated; good fortune comes and shines radiantly from their foreheads. ||11||
The Bani of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar.
It permeates the hearts of Your devotees.
Serving You, peace is obtained; granting Your Mercy, You bestow salvation. ||12||
Meeting with the True Guru, one comes to know;
by this meeting, one comes to chant the Name.
Without the True Guru, God is not found; all have grown weary of performing religious rituals. ||13||
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru;
I was wandering in doubt, and He has set me on the right path.
If the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, He unites us with Himself. ||14||
You, Lord, are pervading in all,
and yet, the Creator keeps Himself concealed.
O Nanak, the Creator is revealed to the Gurmukh, within whom He has infused His Light. ||15||
The Master Himself bestows honor.
He creates and bestows body and soul.
He Himself preserves the honor of His servants; He places both His Hands upon their foreheads. ||16||
All strict rituals are just clever contrivances.
My God knows everything.
He has made His Glory manifest, and all people celebrate Him. ||17 |
| He has not considered my merits and demerits;
this is God's Own Nature.
Hugging me close in His Embrace, He protects me, and now, even the hot wind does not touch me. ||18||
Within my mind and body, I meditate on God.
I have obtained the fruits of my soul's desire.
You are the Supreme Lord and Master, above the heads of kings. Nanak lives by chanting Your Name. ||19||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 060

You Yourself created the Universe;
You created the play of duality, and staged it.
The Truest of the True is pervading everywhere; He instructs those with whom He is pleased. ||20||
By Guru's Grace, I have found God.
By His Grace, I have shed emotional attachment to Maya.
Showering His Mercy, He has blended me into Himself. ||21||
You are the Gopis, the milk-maids of Krishna; You are the sacred river Jamunaa; You are Krishna, the herdsman.
You Yourself support the world.
By Your Command, human beings are fashioned. You Yourself embellish them, and then again destroy them. ||22||
Those who have focused their consciousness on the True Guru
have rid themselves of the love of duality.
The light of those mortal beings is immaculate. They depart after redeeming their lives. ||23||
Forever and ever, night and day, I praise the Greatness of Your Goodness.
You bestow Your Gifts, even if we do not ask for them. Says Nanak, contemplate the True Lord. ||24||1||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
I fall at His Feet to please and appease Him.
The True Guru has united me with the Lord, the Primal Being. There is no other as great as He. ||1||Pause||
The Lord of the Universe is my Sweet Beloved.
He is sweeter than my mother or father.
Among all sisters and brothers and friends, there is no one like You. ||1||
By Your Command, the month of Saawan has come.
I have hooked up the plow of Truth,
and I plant the seed of the Name in hopes that the Lord, in His Generosity, will bestow a bountiful harvest. ||2||
Meeting with the Guru, I recognize only the One Lord.
In my consciousness, I do not know of any other account.
The Lord has assigned one task to me; as it pleases Him, I perform it. ||3||
Enjoy yourselves and eat, O Siblings of Destiny.
In the Guru's Court, He has blessed me with the Robe of Honor.
I have become the Master of my body-village; I have taken the five rivals as prisoners. ||4||
I have come to Your Sanctuary.
The five farm-hands have become my tenants;
none dare to raise their heads against me. O Nanak, my village is populous and prosperous. ||5||
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You.
I meditate on You continually.
The village was in ruins, but You have re-populated it. I am a sacrifice to You. ||6||
O Beloved Lord, I meditate on You continually;
I obtain the fruits of my mind's desires.
All my affairs are arranged, and the hunger of my mind is appeased. ||7||
I have forsaken all my entanglements;
I serve the True Lord of the Universe.
I have firmly attached the Name, the Home of the Nine Treasures to my robe. ||8||
I have obtained the comfort of comforts.
The Guru has implanted the Word of the Shabad deep within me.
The True Guru has shown me my Husband Lord; He has placed His Hand upon my forehead. ||9||
I have established the Temple of Truth.
I sought out the Guru's Sikhs, and brought them into it.
I wash their feet, and wave the fan over them. Bowing low, I fall at their feet. ||10||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 061

I heard of the Guru, and so I went to Him.
He instilled within me the Naam, the goodness of charity and true cleansing.
All the world is liberated, O Nanak, by embarking upon the Boat of Truth. ||11||
The whole Universe serves You, day and night.
Please hear my prayer, O Dear Lord.
I have thoroughly tested and seen all-You alone, by Your Pleasure, can save us. ||12||
Now, the Merciful Lord has issued His Command.
Let no one chase after and attack anyone else.
Let all abide in peace, under this Benevolent Rule. ||13||
Softly and gently, drop by drop, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles down.
I speak as my Lord and Master causes me to speak.
I place all my faith in You; please accept me. ||14||
Your devotees are forever hungry for You.
O Lord, please fulfill my desires.
Grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Giver of Peace. Please, take me into Your Embrace. ||15||
I have not found any other as Great as You.
You pervade the continents, the worlds and the nether regions;
You are permeating all places and interspaces. Nanak: You are the True Support of Your devotees. ||16||
I am a wrestler; I belong to the Lord of the World.
I met with the Guru, and I have tied a tall, plumed turban.
All have gathered to watch the wrestling match, and the Merciful Lord Himself is seated to behold it. ||17||
The bugles play and the drums beat.
The wrestlers enter the arena and circle around.
I have thrown the five challengers to the ground, and the Guru has patted me on the back. ||18||
All have gathered together,
but we shall return home by different routes.
The Gurmukhs reap their profits and leave, while the self-willed manmukhs lose their investment and depart. ||19||
You are without color or mark.
The Lord is seen to be manifest and present.
Hearing of Your Glories again and again, Your devotees meditate on You; they are attuned to You, O Lord, Treasure of Excellence. ||20||
Through age after age, I am the servant of the Merciful Lord.
The Guru has cut away my bonds.
I shall not have to dance in the wrestling arena of life again. Nanak has searched, and found this opportunity. ||21||2||29||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Pehray, First House:
In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you were cast into the womb, by the Lord's Command.
Upside-down, within the womb, you performed penance, O my merchant friend, and you prayed to your Lord and Master.
You uttered prayers to your Lord and Master, while upside-down, and you meditated on Him with deep love and affection.
You came into this Dark Age of Kali Yuga naked, and you shall depart again naked.
As God's Pen has written on your forehead, so it shall be with your soul.
Says Nanak, in the first watch of the night, by the Hukam of the Lord's Command, you enter into the womb. ||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 062

In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you have forgotten to meditate.
From hand to hand, you are passed around, O my merchant friend, like Krishna in the house of Yashoda.
From hand to hand, you are passed around, and your mother says, “This is my son.”
O, my thoughtless and foolish mind, think: In the end, nothing shall be yours.
You do not know the One who created the creation. Gather spiritual wisdom within your mind.
Says Nanak, in the second watch of the night, you have forgotten to meditate. ||2||
In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your consciousness is focused on wealth and youth.
You have not remembered the Name of the Lord, O my merchant friend, although it would release you from bondage.
You do not remember the Name of the Lord, and you become confused by Maya.
Revelling in your riches and intoxicated with youth, you waste your life uselessly.
You have not traded in righteousness and Dharma; you have not made good deeds your friends.
Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night, your mind is attached to wealth and youth. ||3||
In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Grim Reaper comes to the field.
When the Messenger of Death seizes and dispatches you, O my merchant friend, no one knows the mystery of where you have gone.
So think of the Lord! No one knows this secret, of when the Messenger of Death will seize you and take you away.
All your weeping and wailing then is false. In an instant, you become a stranger.
You obtain exactly what you have longed for.
Says Nanak, in the fourth watch of the night, O mortal, the Grim Reaper has harvested your field. ||4||1||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your innocent mind has a child-like understanding.
You drink milk, and you are fondled so gently, O my merchant friend. The mother and father love their child so much, but in Maya, all are caught in emotional attachment.
By the good fortune of good deeds done in the past, you have come, and now you perform actions to determine your future.
Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained, and you are drowned in the love of duality.
Says Nanak, in the first watch of the night, O mortal, you shall be saved by remembering the Lord. ||1||
In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you are intoxicated with the wine of youth and beauty.
Day and night, you are engrossed in sexual desire, O my merchant friend, and your consciousness is blind to the Naam.
The Lord's Name is not within your heart, but all sorts of other tastes seem sweet to you.
You have no wisdom at all, no meditation, no virtue or self-discipline; in falsehood, you are caught in the cycle of birth and death.
Pilgrimages, fasts, purification and self-discipline are of no use, nor are rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship.
O Nanak, emancipation comes only by loving devotional worship; through duality, people are engrossed in duality. ||2||
In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the swans, the white hairs, come and land upon the pool of the head.
Youth wears itself out, and old age triumphs, O my merchant friend; as time passes, your days diminish.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 063

At the last moment, you repent-you are so blind!-when the Messenger of Death seizes you and carries you away.
You kept all your things for yourself, but in an instant, they are all lost.
Your intellect left you, your wisdom departed, and now you repent for the evil deeds you committed.
Says Nanak, O mortal, in the third watch of the night, let your consciousness be lovingly focused on God. ||3||
In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your body grows old and weak.
Your eyes go blind, and cannot see, O my merchant friend, and your ears do not hear any words.
Your eyes go blind, and your tongue is unable to taste; you live only with the help of others.
With no virtue within, how can you find peace? The self-willed manmukh comes and goes in reincarnation.
When the crop of life has matured, it bends, breaks and perishes; why take pride in that which comes and goes?
Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, the Gurmukh recognizes the Word of the Shabad. ||4||
Your breath comes to its end, O my merchant friend, and your shoulders are weighed down by the tyrant of old age.
Not one iota of virtue came into you, O my merchant friend; bound and gagged by evil, you are driven along.
One who departs with virtue and self-discipline is not struck down, and is not consigned to the cycle of birth and death.
The Messenger of Death and his trap cannot touch him; through loving devotional worship, he crosses over the ocean of fear.
He departs with honor, and merges in intuitive peace and poise; all his pains depart.
Says Nanak, when the mortal becomes Gurmukh, he is saved and honored by the True Lord. ||5||2||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord places you in the womb.
You meditate on the Lord, and chant the Lord's Name, O my merchant friend. You contemplate the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and meditating on it within the fire of the womb, your life is sustained by dwelling on the Naam.
You are born and you come out, and your mother and father are delighted to see your face.
Remember the One, O mortal, to whom the child belongs. As Gurmukh, reflect upon Him within your heart.
Says Nanak, O mortal, in the first watch of the night, dwell upon the Lord, who shall shower you with His Grace. ||1||
In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the mind is attached to the love of duality.
Mother and father hug you close in their embrace, claiming, “He is mine, he is mine”; so is the child brought up, O my merchant friend.
Your mother and father constantly hug you close in their embrace; in their minds, they believe that you will provide for them and support them.
The fool does not know the One who gives; instead, he clings to the gift.
Rare is the Gurmukh who reflects upon, meditates upon, and within his mind, is lovingly attached to the Lord.
Says Nanak, in the second watch of the night, O mortal, death never devours you. ||2||
In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your mind is entangled in worldly and household affairs.
You think of wealth, and gather wealth, O my merchant friend, but you do not contemplate the Lord or the Lord's Name.
You never dwell upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, who will be your only Helper and Support in the end.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 064

This wealth, property and Maya are false. In the end, you must leave these, and depart in sorrow.
Those whom the Lord, in His Mercy, unites with the Guru, reflect upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night, O mortal, they go, and are united with the Lord. ||3||
In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord announces the time of departure.
Serve the Perfect True Guru, O my merchant friend; your entire life-night is passing away.
Serve the Lord each and every instant-do not delay! You shall become eternal throughout the ages.
Enjoy ecstasy forever with the Lord, and do away with the pains of birth and death.
Know that there is no difference between the Guru, the True Guru, and your Lord and Master. Meeting with Him, take pleasure in the Lord's devotional service.
Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, the life-night of the devotee is fruitful. ||4||1||3||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord placed your soul in the womb.
In the tenth month, you were made into a human being, O my merchant friend, and you were given your allotted time to perform good deeds.
You were given this time to perform good deeds, according to your pre-ordained destiny.
God placed you with your mother, father, brothers, sons and wife.
God Himself is the Cause of causes, good and bad-no one has control over these things.
Says Nanak, O mortal, in the first watch of the night, the soul is placed in the womb. ||1||
In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the fullness of youth rises in you like waves.
You do not distinguish between good and evil, O my merchant friend-your mind is intoxicated with ego.
Mortal beings do not distinguish between good and evil, and the road ahead is treacherous.
They never serve the Perfect True Guru, and the cruel tyrant Death stands over their heads.
When the Righteous Judge seizes you and interrogates you, O madman, what answer will you give him then?
Says Nanak, in the second watch of the night, O mortal, the fullness of youth tosses you about like waves in the storm. ||2||
In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the blind and ignorant person gathers poison.
He is entangled in emotional attachment to his wife and sons, O my merchant friend, and deep within him, the waves of greed are rising up.
The waves of greed are rising up within him, and he does not remember God.
He does not join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and he suffers in terrible pain through countless incarnations.
He has forgotten the Creator, his Lord and Master, and he does not meditate on Him, even for an instant.
Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night, the blind and ignorant person gathers poison. ||3||
In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, that day is drawing near.
As Gurmukh, remember the Naam, O my merchant friend. It shall be your Friend in the Court of the Lord.
As Gurmukh, remember the Naam, O mortal; in the end, it shall be your only companion.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 065

This emotional attachment to Maya shall not go with you; it is false to fall in love with it.
The entire night of your life has passed away in darkness; but by serving the True Guru, the Divine Light shall dawn within.
Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, that day is drawing near! ||4||
Receiving the summons from the Lord of the Universe, O my merchant friend, you must arise and depart with the actions you have committed.
You are not allowed a moment's delay, O my merchant friend; the Messenger of Death seizes you with firm hands.
Receiving the summons, people are seized and dispatched. The self-willed manmukhs are miserable forever.
But those who serve the Perfect True Guru are forever happy in the Court of the Lord.
The body is the field of karma in this age; whatever you plant, you shall harvest.
Says Nanak, the devotees look beautiful in the Court of the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs wander forever in reincarnation. ||5||1||4||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl, Second House, Chhant:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
How can the ignorant soul-bride obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, while she is in this world of her father's home?
When the Lord Himself grants His Grace, the Gurmukh learns the duties of her Husband's Celestial Home.
The Gurmukh learns the duties of her Husband's Celestial Home; she meditates forever on the Lord, Har, Har.
She walks happily among her companions, and in the Lord's Court, she swings her arms joyfully.
Her account is cleared by the Righteous Judge of Dharma, when she chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The ignorant soul-bride becomes Gurmukh, and gains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, while she is still in her father's house. ||1||
My marriage has been performed, O my father. As Gurmukh, I have found the Lord.
The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled. The Guru has revealed the blazing light of spiritual wisdom.
This spiritual wisdom given by the Guru shines forth, and the darkness has been dispelled. I have found the Priceless Jewel of the Lord.
The sickness of my ego has been dispelled, and my pain is over and done. Through the Guru's Teachings, my identity has consumed my identical identity.
I have obtained my Husband Lord, the Akaal Moorat, the Undying Form. He is Imperishable; He shall never die, and He shall never ever leave.
My marriage has been performed, O my father. As Gurmukh, I have found the Lord. ||2||
The Lord is the Truest of the True, O my father. Meeting with the humble servants of the Lord, the marriage procession looks beautiful.
She who chants the Lord's Name is happy in this world of her father's home, and in the next world of her Husband Lord, she shall be very beautiful.
In her Husband Lord's Celestial Home, she shall be most beautiful, if she has remembered the Naam in this world.
Fruitful are the lives of those who, as Gurmukh, have conquered their minds-they have won the game of life.
Joining with the humble Saints of the Lord, my actions bring prosperity, and I have obtained the Lord of Bliss as my Husband.
The Lord is the Truest of the True, O my father. Joining with the humble servants of the Lord, the marriage party has been embellished. ||3||
O my father, give me the Name of the Lord God as my wedding gift and dowry.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 066

Give me the Lord as my wedding gown, and the Lord as my glory, to accomplish my works.
Through devotional worship to the Lord, this ceremony is made blissful and beautiful; the Guru, the True Guru, has given this gift.
Across the continents, and throughout the Universe, the Lord's Glory is pervading. This gift is not diminished by being diffused among all.
Any other dowry, which the self-willed manmukhs offer for show, is only false egotism and a worthless display.
O my father, please give me the Name of the Lord God as my wedding gift and dowry. ||4||
The Lord, Raam, Raam, is All-pervading, O my father. Meeting her Husband Lord, the soul-bride blossoms forth like the flourishing vine.
In age after age, through all the ages, forever and ever, those who belong to the Guru's Family shall prosper and increase.
Age after age, the Family of the True Guru shall increase. As Gurmukh, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Almighty Lord never dies or goes away. Whatever He gives, keeps on increasing.
O Nanak, the One Lord is the Saint of Saints. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the soul-bride is bountiful and beautiful.
The Lord, Raam, Raam, is All-pervading, O my father. Meeting her Husband Lord, the soul-bride blossoms forth like the flourishing vine. ||5||1||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Chhant:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O dear beloved mind, my friend, reflect upon the Name of the Lord of the Universe.
O dear beloved mind, my friend, the Lord shall always be with you.
The Name of the Lord shall be with you as your Helper and Support. Meditate on Him-no one who does so shall ever return empty-handed.
You shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires, by focusing your consciousness on the Lord's Lotus Feet.
He is totally pervading the water and the land; He is the Lord of the World-forest. Behold Him in exaltation in each and every heart.
Nanak gives this advice: O beloved mind, in the Company of the Holy, burn away your doubts. ||1||
O dear beloved mind, my friend, without the Lord, all outward show is false.
O dear beloved mind, my friend, the world is an ocean of poison.
Let the Lord's Lotus Feet be your Boat, so that pain and skepticism shall not touch you.
Meeting with the Perfect Guru, by great good fortune, meditate on God twenty-four hours a day.
From the very beginning, and throughout the ages, He is the Lord and Master of His servants. His Name is the Support of His devotees.
Nanak gives this advice: O beloved mind, without the Lord, all outward show is false. ||2||
O dear beloved mind, my friend, load the profitable cargo of the Lord's Name.
O dear beloved mind, my friend, enter through the eternal Door of the Lord.
One who serves at the Door of the Imperceptible and Unfathomable Lord, obtains this eternal position.
There is no birth or death there, no coming or going; anguish and anxiety are ended.
The accounts of Chitr and Gupt, the recording scribes of the conscious and the subconscious are torn up, and the Messenger of Death cannot do anything.
Nanak gives this advice: O beloved mind, load the profitable cargo of the Lord's Name. ||3||
O dear beloved mind, my friend, abide in the Society of the Saints.
O dear beloved mind, my friend, chanting the Lord's Name, the Divine Light shines within.
Remember your Lord and Master, who is easily obtained, and all desires shall be fulfilled.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 067

By my past actions, I have found the Lord, the Greatest Lover. Separated from Him for so long, I am united with Him again.
Inside and out, He is pervading everywhere. Faith in Him has welled up within my mind.
Nanak gives this advice: O beloved mind, let the Society of the Saints be your dwelling. ||4||
O dear beloved mind, my friend, let your mind remain absorbed in loving devotion to the Lord.
O dear beloved mind, my friend, the fish of the mind lives only when it is immersed in the Water of the Lord.
Drinking in the Lord's Ambrosial Bani, the mind is satisfied, and all pleasures come to abide within.
Attaining the Lord of Excellence, I sing the Songs of Joy. The True Guru, becoming merciful, has fulfilled my desires.
He has attached me to the hem of His robe, and I have obtained the nine treasures. My Lord and Master has bestowed His Name, which is everything to me.
Nanak instructs the Saints to teach, that the mind is imbued with loving devotion to the Lord. ||5||1||2||
Chhants Of Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Dakhanaa:
My Beloved Husband Lord is deep within my heart. How can I see Him?
In the Sanctuary of the Saints, O Nanak, the Support of the breath of life is found. ||1||
Chhant:
To love the Lotus Feet of the Lord-this way of life has come into the minds of His Saints.
The love of duality, this evil practice, this bad habit, is not liked by the Lord's slaves.
It is not pleasing to the Lord's slaves; without the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, how can they find peace, even for a moment?
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the body and mind are empty; like fish out of water, they die.
Please meet with me, O my Beloved-You are the Support of my breath of life. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing Your Glorious Praises.
O Lord and Master of Nanak, please grant Your Grace, and permeate my body, mind and being. ||1||
DAKHANAA:
He is Beautiful in all places; I do not see any other at all.
Meeting with the True Guru, O Nanak, the doors are opened wide. ||1||
Chhant:
Your Word is Incomparable and Infinite. I contemplate the Word of Your Bani, the Support of the Saints.
I remember Him in meditation with every breath and morsel of food, with perfect faith. How could I forget Him from my mind?
How could I forget Him from my mind, even for an instant? He is the Most Worthy; He is my very life!
My Lord and Master is the Giver of the fruits of the mind's desires. He knows all the useless vanities and pains of the soul.
Meditating on the Patron of lost souls, the Companion of all, your life shall not be lost in the gamble.
Nanak offers this prayer to God: Please shower me with Your Mercy, and carry me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
DAKHANAA:
People bathe in the dust of the feet of the Saints, when the Lord becomes merciful.
I have obtained all things, O Nanak; the Lord is my Wealth and Property. ||1||
Chhant:
My Lord and Master's Home is beautiful. It is the resting place of His devotees, who live in hopes of attaining it.
Their minds and bodies are absorbed in meditation on the Name of God; they drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 068

They drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar, and become eternally stable. They know that the water of corruption is insipid and tasteless.
When my God, the Lord of the Universe became merciful, I came to look upon the Saadh Sangat as the treasure.
All pleasures and supreme ecstasy, O my Beloved, come to those who sew the Jewel of the Lord into their minds.
They do not forget, even for an instant, the Support of the breath of life. They live by constantly meditating on Him, O Nanak. ||3||
DAKHANAA:
O Lord, You meet and merge with those whom you have made Your Own.
You Yourself are entranced, O Nanak, hearing Your Own Praises. ||1||
Chhant:
Administering the intoxicating drug of love, I have won over the Lord of the Universe; I have fascinated His Mind.
By the Grace of the Saints, I am held in the loving embrace of the Unfathomable Lord, and I am entranced.
Held in the Lord's loving embrace, I look beautiful, and all my pains have been dispelled. By the loving worship of His devotees, the Lord has come under their power.
All pleasures have come to dwell in the mind; the Lord of the Universe is pleased and appeased. Birth and death have been totally eliminated.
O my companions, sing the Songs of Joy. My desires have been fulfilled, and I shall never again be trapped or shaken by Maya.
Taking hold of my hand, O Nanak, my Beloved God will not let me be swallowed up by the world-ocean. ||4||
DAKHANAA:
The Master's Name is Priceless; no one knows its value.
Those who have good destiny recorded upon their foreheads, O Nanak, enjoy the Love of the Lord. ||1||
Chhant:
Those who chant are sanctified. All those who listen are blessed, and those who write save their ancestors.
Those who join the Saadh Sangat are imbued with the Lord's Love; they reflect and meditate on God.
Contemplating God, their lives are reformed and redeemed; God has showered His Perfect Mercy upon them.
Taking them by the hand, the Lord has blessed them with His Praises. They no longer have to wander in reincarnation, and they never have to die.
Through the Kind and Compassionate True Guru, I have met the Lord; I have conquered sexual desire, anger and greed.
Our Indescribable Lord and Master cannot be described. Nanak is devoted, forever a sacrifice to Him. ||5||1||3||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl, Vanajaaraa ~ The Merchant: One Universal CREATOR GOD. TRUTH IS THE NAME. BY GURU'S GRACE:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. By Guru's Grace:
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Excellent and Sublime. He created everyone.
The Lord cherishes all beings. He permeates each and every heart.
Meditate forever on that Lord. Without Him, there is no other at all.
Those who focus their consciousness on emotional attachment to Maya must leave; they depart crying out in despair.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, his only Companion in the end. ||1||
I have none other than You, O Lord.
In the Guru's Sanctuary, the Lord is found, O my merchant friend; by great good fortune, He is obtained. ||1||Pause||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 069

Without the humble Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, no one has obtained the Lord's Name.
Those who do their deeds in ego are like the prostitute's son, who has no name.
The father's status is obtained only if the Guru is pleased and bestows His Favor.
By great good fortune, the Guru is found; embrace love for the Lord, day and night.
Servant Nanak has realized God; he sings the Lord's Praises through the actions he does. ||2||
In my mind there is such a deep yearning for the Lord, Har, Har.
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Naam within me; I have found the Lord through the Lord God's Name. ||1||Pause||
As long as there is youth and health, meditate on the Naam.
Along the way, the Lord shall go along with you, and in the end, He shall save you.
I am a sacrifice to those, within whose minds the Lord has come to dwell.
Those who have not remembered the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, shall leave with regret in the end.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their foreheads, O servant Nanak, meditate on the Naam. ||3||
O my mind, embrace love for the Lord, Har, Har.
By great good fortune, the Guru is found; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we are carried across to the other side. ||1||Pause||
The Lord Himself creates, He Himself gives and takes away.
The Lord Himself leads us astray in doubt; the Lord Himself imparts understanding.
The minds of the Gurmukhs are illuminated and enlightened; they are so very rare.
I am a sacrifice to those who find the Lord, through the Guru's Teachings.
Servant Nanak's heart-lotus has blossomed forth, and the Lord, Har, Har, has come to dwell in the mind. ||4||
O mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Guru, O my soul; all your sins shall be taken away. ||1||Pause||
The All-pervading Lord dwells within each and every person's heart-how can He be obtained?
By meeting the Perfect Guru, the True Guru, the Lord comes to dwell within the conscious mind.
The Naam is my Support and Sustenance. From the Lord's Name, I obtain salvation and understanding.
My faith is in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Lord's Name is my status and honor.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He is dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love. ||5||
Meditate on the Lord, the True Lord God.
Through the Guru's Word, you shall come to know the Lord God. From the Lord God, everything was created. ||1||Pause||
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, come to the Guru and meet Him.
They love to serve, O my merchant friend, and through the Guru, they are illuminated by the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Blessed, blessed is the trade of those traders who have loaded the merchandise of the Wealth of the Lord.
The faces of the Gurmukhs are radiant in the Court of the Lord; they come to the Lord and merge with Him.
O servant Nanak, they alone find the Guru, with whom the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence, is pleased. ||6||
Meditate on the Lord, with every breath and morsel of food.
The Gurmukhs embrace the Love of the Lord in their minds; they are continually occupied with the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 070

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Vaar Of Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl, With Shaloks:
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Among the ragas, Siree Raag is the best, if it inspires you to enshrine love for the True Lord.
The True Lord comes to abide forever in the mind, and your understanding becomes steady and unequalled.
The priceless jewel is obtained, by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The tongue becomes true, the mind becomes true, and the body becomes true as well.
O Nanak, forever true are the dealings of those who serve the True Guru. ||1||
Third Mehl:
All other loves are transitory, as long as people do not love their Lord and Master.
This mind is enticed by Maya-it cannot see or hear.
Without seeing her Husband Lord, love does not well up; what can the blind person do?
O Nanak, the True One who takes away the eyes of spiritual wisdom-He alone can restore them. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord alone is the One Creator; there is only the One Court of the Lord.
The One Lord's Command is the One and Only-enshrine the One Lord in your consciousness.
Without that Lord, there is no other at all. Remove your fear, doubt and dread.
Praise that Lord who protects you, inside your home, and outside as well.
When that Lord becomes merciful, and one comes to chant the Lord's Name, one swims across the ocean of fear. ||1||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The gifts belong to our Lord and Master; how can we compete with Him?
Some remain awake and aware, and do not receive these gifts, while others are awakened from their sleep to be blessed. ||1||
First Mehl:
Faith, contentment and tolerance are the food and provisions of the angels.
They obtain the Perfect Vision of the Lord, while those who gossip find no place of rest. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself created all; You Yourself delegate the tasks.
You Yourself are pleased, beholding Your Own Glorious Greatness.
O Lord, there is nothing at all beyond You. You are the True Lord.
You Yourself are contained in all places.
Meditate on that Lord, O Saints; He shall rescue and save you. ||2||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Pride in social status is empty; pride in personal glory is useless.
The One Lord gives shade to all beings.
You may call yourself good;
O Nanak, this will only be known when your honor is approved in God's Account. ||1||
Second Mehl:
Die before the one whom you love;
to live after he dies is to live a worthless life in this world. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself created the earth, and the two lamps of the sun and the moon.
You created the fourteen world-shops, in which Your Business is transacted.
The Lord bestows His Profits on those who become Gurmukh.
The Messenger of Death does not touch those who drink in the True Ambrosial Nectar.
They themselves are saved, along with their family, and all those who follow them are saved as well. ||3||
Shalok, First Mehl:
He created the Creative Power of the Universe, within which He dwells.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 071

One who reflects upon his allotted span of life, becomes the slave of God.
The value of the Creative Power of the Universe cannot be known.
Even if its value were known, it could not be described.
Some think about religious rituals and regulations,
but without understanding, how can they cross over to the other side?
Let sincere faith be your bowing in prayer, and let the conquest of your mind be your objective in life.
Wherever I look, there I see God's Presence. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The Society of the Guru is not obtained like this, by trying to be near or far away.
O Nanak, you shall meet the True Guru, if your mind remains in His Presence. ||2||
Pauree:
The seven islands, seven seas, nine continents, four Vedas and eighteen Puraanas
\-O Lord, You pervade and permeate all. Lord, everyone loves You.
All beings and creatures meditate on You, Lord. You hold the earth in Your Hands.
I am a sacrifice to those Gurmukhs who worship and adore the Lord.
You Yourself are All-pervading; You stage this wondrous drama! ||4||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Why ask for a pen, and why ask for ink? Write within your heart.
Remain immersed forever in the Love of your Lord and Master, and your love for Him shall never break.
Pen and ink shall pass away, along with what has been written.
O Nanak, the Love of your Husband Lord shall never perish. The True Lord has bestowed it, as it was pre-ordained. ||1||
Third Mehl:
That which is seen, shall not go along with you. What does it take to make you see this?
The True Guru has implanted the True Name within; remain lovingly absorbed in the True One.
O Nanak, the Word of His Shabad is True. By His Grace, it is obtained. ||2||
Pauree:
O Lord, You are inside and outside as well. You are the Knower of secrets.
Whatever anyone does, the Lord knows. O my mind, think of the Lord.
The one who commits sins lives in fear, while the one who lives righteously rejoices.
O Lord, You Yourself are True, and True is Your Justice. Why should anyone be afraid?
O Nanak, those who recognize the True Lord are blended with the True One. ||5||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Burn the pen, and burn the ink; burn the paper as well.
Burn the writer who writes in the love of duality.
O Nanak, people do what is pre-ordained; they cannot do anything else. ||1||
Third Mehl:
False is other reading, and false is other speaking, in the love of Maya.
O Nanak, without the Name, nothing is permanent; those who read and read are ruined. ||2||
Pauree:
Great is the Greatness of the Lord, and the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
Great is the Greatness of the Lord; His Justice is totally Righteous.
Great is the Greatness of the Lord; people receive the fruits of the soul.
Great is the Greatness of the Lord; He does not hear the words of the back-biters.
Great is the Greatness of the Lord; He gives His Gifts without being asked. ||6||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who act in ego shall all die. Their worldly possessions shall not go along with them.
Because of their love of duality, they suffer in pain. The Messenger of Death is watching all.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 072

O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved, by contemplating the True Name. ||1||
First Mehl:
We are good at talking, but our actions are bad.
Mentally, we are impure and black, but outwardly, we appear white.
We imitate those who stand and serve at the Lord's Door.
They are attuned to the Love of their Husband Lord, and they experience the pleasure of His Love.
They remain powerless, even while they have power; they remain humble and meek.
O Nanak, our lives become profitable if we associate with them. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself are the water, You Yourself are the fish, and You Yourself are the net.
You Yourself cast the net, and You Yourself are the bait.
You Yourself are the lotus, unaffected and still brightly-colored in hundreds of feet of water.
You Yourself liberate those who think of You for even an instant.
O Lord, nothing is beyond You. I am delighted to behold You, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||7||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
One who does not know the Hukam of the Lord's Command cries out in terrible pain.
She is filled with deception, and she cannot sleep in peace.
But if the soul-bride follows the Will of her Lord and Master, she shall be honored in her own home, and called to the Mansion of His Presence.
O Nanak, by His Mercy, this understanding is obtained.
By Guru's Grace, she is absorbed into the True One. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O self-willed manmukh, devoid of the Naam, do not be misled upon beholding the color of the safflower.
Its color lasts for only a few days-it is worthless!
Attached to duality, the foolish, blind and stupid people waste away and die.
Like worms, they live in manure, and in it, they die over and over again.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are dyed in the color of truth; they take on the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru.
The color of devotional worship does not fade away; they remain intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
You created the entire universe, and You Yourself bring sustenance to it.
Some eat and survive by practicing fraud and deceit; from their mouths they drop falsehood and lies.
As it pleases You, You assign them their tasks.
Some understand Truthfulness; they are given the inexhaustible treasure.
Those who eat by remembering the Lord are prosperous, while those who do not remember Him stretch out their hands in need. ||8||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The Pandits, the religious scholars, constantly read and recite the Vedas, for the sake of the love of Maya.
In the love of duality, the foolish people have forgotten the Lord's Name; they shall receive their punishment.
They never think of the One who gave them body and soul, who provides sustenance to all.
The noose of death shall not be cut away from their necks; they shall come and go in reincarnation over and over again.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not understand anything. They do what they are pre-ordained to do.
Through perfect destiny, they meet the True Guru, the Giver of peace, and the Naam comes to abide in the mind.
They enjoy peace, they wear peace, and they pass their lives in the peace of peace.
O Nanak, they do not forget the Naam from the mind; they are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Serving the True Guru, peace is obtained. The True Name is the Treasure of Excellence.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 073

Follow the Guru's Teachings, and recognize your own self; the Divine Light of the Lord's Name shall shine within.
The true ones practice Truth; greatness rests in the Great Lord.
Body, soul and all things belong to the Lord-praise Him, and offer your prayers to Him.
Sing the Praises of the True Lord through the Word of His Shabad, and you shall abide in the peace of peace.
You may practice chanting, penance and austere self-discipline within your mind, but without the Name, life is useless.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the Name is obtained, while the self-willed manmukh wastes away in emotional attachment.
Please protect me, by the Pleasure of Your Will. Nanak is Your slave. ||2||
Pauree:
All are Yours, and You belong to all. You are the wealth of all.
Everyone begs from You, and all offer prayers to You each day.
Those, unto whom You give, receive everything. You are far away from some, and You are close to others.
Without You, there is not even a place to stand begging. See this yourself and verify it in your mind.
All praise You, O Lord; at Your Door, the Gurmukhs are enlightened. ||9||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read and read, and shout out loud, but they are attached to the love of Maya.
They do not recognize God within themselves-they are so foolish and ignorant!
In the love of duality, they try to teach the world, but they do not understand meditative contemplation.
They lose their lives uselessly; they die, only to be re-born, over and over again. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Those who serve the True Guru obtain the Name. Reflect on this and understand.
Eternal peace and joy abide in their minds; they abandon their cries and complaints.
Their identity consumes their identical identity, and their minds become pure by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
O Nanak, attuned to the Shabad, they are liberated. They love their Beloved Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
Service to the Lord is fruitful; through it, the Gurmukh is honored and approved.
That person, with whom the Lord is pleased, meets with the Guru, and meditates on the Name of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found. The Lord carries us across.
Through stubborn-mindedness, none have found Him; go and consult the Vedas on this.
O Nanak, he alone serves the Lord, whom the Lord attaches to Himself. ||10||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Nanak, he is a brave warrior, who conquers and subdues his vicious inner ego.
Praising the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Gurmukhs redeem their lives.
They themselves are liberated forever, and they save all their ancestors.
Those who love the Naam look beauteous at the Gate of Truth.
The self-willed manmukhs die in egotism-even their death is painfully ugly.
Everything happens according to the Lord's Will; what can the poor people do?
Attached to self-conceit and duality, they have forgotten their Lord and Master.
O Nanak, without the Name, everything is painful, and happiness is forgotten. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord within me. It has dispelled my doubts from within.
I sing the Lord's Name and the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises; the Divine Light shines, and now I see the Way.
Conquering my ego, I am lovingly focused on the One Lord; the Naam has come to dwell within me.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 074

Following the Guru's Teachings, I cannot be touched by the Messenger of Death. I am absorbed in the True Name.
The Creator Himself is All-pervading everywhere; He links those with whom He is pleased to His Name.
Servant Nanak chants the Naam, and so he lives. Without the Name, he would die in an instant. ||2||
Pauree:
One who is accepted at the Court of the Lord shall be accepted in courts everywhere.
Wherever he goes, he is recognized as honorable. Seeing his face, all sinners are saved.
Within him is the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Through the Naam, he is exalted.
He worships the Name, and believes in the Name; the Name erases all his sinful mistakes.
Those who meditate on the Name, with one-pointed mind and focused consciousness, remain forever stable in the world. ||11||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Worship the Divine, Supreme Soul, with the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru.
If the individual soul has faith in the Supreme Soul, then it shall obtain realization within its own home.
The soul becomes steady, and does not waver, by the natural inclination of the Guru's Loving Will.
Without the Guru, intuitive wisdom does not come, and the filth of greed does not depart from within.
If the Lord's Name abides within the mind, for a moment, even for an instant, it is like bathing at all the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Filth does not stick to those who are true, but filth attaches itself to those who love duality.
This filth cannot be washed off, even by bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
The self-willed manmukh does deeds in egotism; he earns only pain and more pain.
O Nanak, the filthy ones become clean only when they meet and surrender to the True Guru. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs may be taught, but how can they really be taught?
The manmukhs do not fit in at all. Because of their past actions, they are condemned to the cycle of reincarnation.
Loving attention to the Lord and attachment to Maya are the two separate ways; all act according to the Hukam of the Lord's Command.
The Gurmukh has conquered his own mind, by applying the Touchstone of the Shabad.
He fights with his mind, he settles with his mind, and he is at peace with his mind.
All obtain the desires of their minds, through the Love of the True Word of the Shabad.
They drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam forever; this is how the Gurmukhs act.
Those who struggle with something other than their own mind, shall depart having wasted their lives.
The self-willed manmukhs, through stubborn-mindedness and the practice of falsehood, lose the game of life.
Those who conquer their own mind, by Guru's Grace, lovingly focus their attention on the Lord.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs practice Truth, while the self-willed manmukhs continue coming and going in reincarnation. ||2||
Pauree:
O Saints of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, listen, and hear the Lord's Teachings, through the True Guru.
Those who have good destiny pre-ordained and inscribed on their foreheads, grasp it and keep it enshrined in the heart.
Through the Guru's Teachings, they intuitively taste the sublime, exquisite and ambrosial sermon of the Lord.
The Divine Light shines in their hearts, and like the sun which removes the darkness of night, it dispels the darkness of ignorance.
As Gurmukh, they behold with their eyes the Unseen, Imperceptible, Unknowable, Immaculate Lord. ||12||
Shalok, Third Mehl:

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 075

Those who serve their True Guru are certified and accepted.
They eradicate selfishness and conceit from within; they remain lovingly absorbed in the True One.
Those who do not serve the True Guru waste away their lives in vain.
O Nanak, the Lord does just as He pleases. No one has any say in this. ||1||
Third Mehl:
With the mind encircled by wickedness and evil, people do evil deeds.
The ignorant worship the love of duality; in the Lord's Court they shall be punished.
So worship the Lord, the Light of the soul; without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained.
Meditation, penance and austere self-discipline are found by surrendering to the True Guru's Will. By His Grace this is received.
O Nanak, serve with this intuitive awareness; only that which is pleasing to the Lord is approved. ||2||
Pauree:
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; it will bring you eternal peace, day and night.
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; meditating on it, all sins and misdeeds shall be erased.
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; through it, all poverty, pain and hunger shall be removed.
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; as Gurmukh, declare your love.
One who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead by the True Lord, chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||13||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who do not serve the True Guru, and who do not contemplate the Word of the Shabad
\-spiritual wisdom does not enter into their hearts; they are like dead bodies in the world.
They go through the cycle of 8.4 million reincarnations, and they are ruined through death and rebirth.
He alone serves the True Guru, whom the Lord Himself inspires to do so.
The Treasure of the Naam is within the True Guru; by His Grace, it is obtained.
Those who are truly attuned to the Word of the Guru's Shabad-their love is forever True.
O Nanak, those who are united with Him shall not be separated again. They merge imperceptibly into God. ||1||
Third Mehl:
One who knows the Benevolent Lord God is the true devotee of Bhagaautee.
By Guru's Grace, he is self-realized.
He restrains his wandering mind, and brings it back to its own home within the self.
He remains dead while yet alive, and he chants the Name of the Lord.
Such a Bhagaautee is most exalted.
O Nanak, he merges into the True One. ||2||
Third Mehl:
He is full of deceit, and yet he calls himself a devotee of Bhagaautee.
Through hypocrisy, he shall never attain the Supreme Lord God.
He slanders others, and pollutes himself with his own filth.
Outwardly, he washes off the filth, but the impurity of his mind does not go away.
He argues with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
Night and day, he suffers, engrossed in the love of duality.
He does not remember the Name of the Lord, but still, he performs all sorts of empty rituals.
That which is pre-ordained cannot be erased.
O Nanak, without serving the True Guru, liberation is not obtained. ||3||
Pauree:
Those who meditate on the True Guru shall not be burnt to ashes.
Those who meditate on the True Guru are satisfied and fulfilled.
Those who meditate on the True Guru are not afraid of the Messenger of Death.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 076

Those upon whom the Lord showers His Mercy, fall at the Feet of the True Guru.
Here and hereafter, their faces are radiant; they go to the Lord's Court in robes of honor. ||14||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
Chop off that head which does not bow to the Lord.
O Nanak, that human body, in which there is no pain of separation from the Lord-take that body and burn it. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Forgetting the Primal Lord, O Nanak, people are born and die, over and over again.
Mistaking it for musk, they have fallen into the stinking pit of filth. ||2||
Pauree:
Meditate on that Name of the Lord, O my mind, whose Command rules over all.
Chant that Name of the Lord, O my mind, which will save you at the very last moment.
Chant that Name of the Lord, O my mind, which shall drive out all hunger and desire from your mind.
Very fortunate and blessed is that Gurmukh who chants the Naam; it shall bring all slanderers and wicked enemies to fall at his feet.
O Nanak, worship and adore the Naam, the Greatest Name of all, before which all come and bow. ||15||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
She may wear good clothes, but the bride is ugly and rude; her mind is false and impure.
She does not walk in harmony with the Will of her Husband Lord. Instead, she foolishly gives Him orders.
But she who walks in harmony with the Guru's Will, shall be spared all pain and suffering.
That destiny which was pre-ordained by the Creator cannot be erased.
She must dedicate her mind and body to her Husband Lord, and enshrine love for the Word of the Shabad.
Without His Name, no one has found Him; see this and reflect upon it in your heart.
O Nanak, she is beautiful and graceful; the Creator Lord ravishes and enjoys her. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Attachment to Maya is an ocean of darkness; neither this shore nor the one beyond can be seen.
The ignorant, self-willed manmukhs suffer in terrible pain; they forget the Lord's Name and drown.
They arise in the morning and perform all sorts of rituals, but they are caught in the love of duality.
Those who serve the True Guru cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs keep the True Name enshrined in their hearts; they are absorbed into the True One. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord pervades and permeates the water, the land and the sky; there is no other at all.
The Lord Himself sits upon His Throne and administers justice. He beats and drives out the false-hearted.
The Lord bestows glorious greatness upon those who are truthful. He administers righteous justice.
So praise the Lord, everybody; He protects the poor and the lost souls.
He honors the righteous and punishes the sinners. ||16||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh, the foolish bride, is a filthy, rude and evil wife.
Forsaking her Husband Lord and leaving her own home, she gives her love to another.
Her desires are never satisfied, and she burns and cries out in pain.
O Nanak, without the Name, she is ugly and ungraceful. She is abandoned and left behind by her Husband Lord. ||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 077

Third Mehl:
The happy soul-bride is attuned to the Word of the Shabad; she is in love with the True Guru.
She continually enjoys and ravishes her Beloved, with true love and affection.
She is such a loveable, beautiful and noble woman.
O Nanak, through the Naam, the happy soul-bride unites with the Lord of Union. ||2||
Pauree:
Lord, everyone sings Your Praises. You have freed us from bondage.
Lord, everyone bows in reverence to You. You have saved us from our sinful ways.
Lord, You are the Honor of the dishonored. Lord, You are the Strongest of the strong.
The Lord beats down the egocentrics and corrects the foolish, self-willed manmukhs.
The Lord bestows glorious greatness on His devotees, the poor, and the lost souls. ||17||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
One who walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru, obtains the greatest glory.
The Exalted Name of the Lord abides in his mind, and no one can take it away.
That person, upon whom the Lord bestows His Grace, receives His Mercy.
O Nanak, creativity is under the control of the Creator; how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize this! ||1||
Third Mehl:
O Nanak, those who worship and adore the Lord's Name night and day, vibrate the String of the Lord's Love.
Maya, the maid-servant of our Lord and Master, serves them.
The Perfect One has made them perfect; by the Hukam of His Command, they are embellished.
By Guru's Grace, they understand Him, and they find the gate of salvation.
The self-willed manmukhs do not know the Lord's Command; they are beaten down by the Messenger of Death.
But the Gurmukhs, who worship and adore the Lord, cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
All their demerits are erased, and replaced with merits. The Guru Himself is their Forgiver. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord's devotees have faith in Him. The Lord knows everything.
No one is as great a Knower as the Lord; the Lord administers righteous justice.
Why should we feel any burning anxiety, since the Lord does not punish without just cause?
True is the Master, and True is His Justice; only the sinners are defeated.
O devotees, praise the Lord with your palms pressed together; the Lord saves His humble devotees. ||18||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Oh, if only I could meet my Beloved, and keep Him enshrined deep within my heart!
I praise that God forever and ever, through love and affection for the Guru.
O Nanak, that one upon whom He bestows His Glance of Grace is united with Him; such a person is the true soul-bride of the Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Serving the Guru, the Lord is obtained, when He bestows His Glance of Grace.
They are transformed from humans into angels, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
They conquer their egotism and merge with the Lord; they are saved through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
O Nanak, they merge imperceptibly into the Lord, who has bestowed His Favor upon them. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord Himself inspires us to worship Him; He reveals His Glorious Greatness.
He Himself inspires us to place our faith in Him. Thus He performs His Own Service.

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 078

The Lord bestows bliss upon His devotees, and gives them a seat in the eternal home.
He does not give the sinners any stability or place of rest; He consigns them to the depths of hell.
The Lord blesses His devotees with His Love; He sides with them and saves them. ||19||
Shalok, First Mehl:
False-mindedness is the drummer-woman; cruelty is the butcheress; slander of others in one's heart is the cleaning-woman, and deceitful anger is the outcast-woman.
What good are the ceremonial lines drawn around your kitchen, when these four are seated there with you?
Make Truth your self-discipline, and make good deeds the lines you draw; make chanting the Name your cleansing bath.
O Nanak, those who do not walk in the ways of sin, shall be exalted in the world hereafter. ||1||
First Mehl:
Which is the swan, and which is the crane? It is only by His Glance of Grace.
Whoever is pleasing to Him, O Nanak, is transformed from a crow into a swan. ||2||
Pauree:
Whatever work you wish to accomplish-tell it to the Lord.
He will resolve your affairs; the True Guru gives His Guarantee of Truth.
In the Society of the Saints, you shall taste the treasure of the Ambrosial Nectar.
The Lord is the Merciful Destroyer of fear; He preserves and protects His slaves.
O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and see the Unseen Lord God. ||20||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Body and soul, all belong to Him. He gives His Support to all.
O Nanak, become Gurmukh and serve Him, who is forever and ever the Giver.
I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Formless Lord.
Their faces are forever radiant, and the whole world bows in reverence to them. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Meeting the True Guru, I am totally transformed; I have obtained the nine treasures to use and consume.
The Siddhis-the eighteen supernatural spiritual powers-follow in my footsteps; I dwell in my own home, within my own self.
The Unstruck Melody constantly vibrates within; my mind is exalted and uplifted-I am lovingly absorbed in the Lord.
O Nanak, devotion to the Lord abides within the minds of those who have such pre-ordained destiny written on their foreheads. ||2||
Pauree:
I am a minstrel of the Lord God, my Lord and Master; I have come to the Lord's Door.
The Lord has heard my sad cries from within; He has called me, His minstrel, into His Presence.
The Lord called His minstrel in, and asked, “Why have you come here?”
“O Merciful God, please grant me the gift of continual meditation on the Lord's Name.”
And so the Lord, the Great Giver, inspired Nanak to chant the Lord's Name, and blessed him with robes of honor. ||21||1||Sudh||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Siree Raag, Kabeer Jee: To Be Sung To The Tune Of “Ayk Su-Aan” :
The mother thinks that her son is growing up; she does not understand that, day by day, his life is diminishing.
Calling him, “Mine, mine”, she fondles him lovingly, while the Messenger of Death looks on and laughs. ||1||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 079

You have misled the world so deeply in doubt.
How can people understand You, when they are entranced by Maya? ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, give up the pleasures of corruption, or else you will surely die of them.
Meditate on the Lord, O mortal being, through the Word of His Bani; you shall be blessed with eternal life. In this way, shall you cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
As it pleases Him, people embrace love for the Lord,
and doubt and delusion are dispelled from within.
Intuitive peace and poise well up within, and the intellect is awakened to spiritual wisdom.
By Guru's Grace, the inner being is touched by the Lord's Love. ||3||
In this association, there is no death.
Recognizing the Hukam of His Command, you shall meet with your Lord and Master. ||1||Second Pause||
Siree Raag, Trilochan:
The mind is totally attached to Maya; the mortal has forgotten his fear of old age and death.
Gazing upon his family, he blossoms forth like the lotus flower; the deceitful person watches and covets the homes of others. ||1||
When the powerful Messenger of Death comes, no one can stand against his awesome power.
Rare, very rare, is that friend who comes and says,
“O my Beloved, take me into Your Embrace! O my Lord, please save me!”||1||Pause||
Indulging in all sorts of princely pleasures, O mortal, you have forgotten God; you have fallen into the world-ocean, and you think that you have become immortal.
Cheated and plundered by Maya, you do not think of God, and you waste your life in laziness. ||2||
The path you must walk is treacherous and terrifying, O mortal; neither the sun nor the moon shine there.
Your emotional attachment to Maya will be forgotten, when you have to leave this world. ||3||
Today, it became clear to my mind that the Righteous Judge of Dharma is watching us.
His messengers, with their awesome power, crush people between their hands; I cannot stand against them. ||4||
If someone is going to teach me something, let it be that the Lord is pervading the forests and fields.
O Dear Lord, You Yourself know everything; so prays Trilochan, Lord. ||5||2||
Siree Raag, Devotee Kabeer Jee:
Listen, O religious scholar: the One Lord alone is Wondrous; no one can describe Him.
He fascinates the angels, the celestial singers and the heavenly musicians; he has strung the three worlds upon His Thread. ||1||
The Unstruck Melody of the Sovereign Lord's Harp vibrates;
by His Glance of Grace, we are lovingly attuned to the Sound-current of the Naad. ||1||Pause||
The Tenth Gate of my crown chakra is the distilling fire, and the channels of the Ida and Pingala are the funnels, to pour in and empty out the golden vat.
Into that vat, there trickles a gentle stream of the most sublime and pure essence of all distilled essences. ||2||
Something wonderful has happened-the breath has become the cup.
In all the three worlds, such a Yogi is unique. What king can compare to him? ||3||
This spiritual wisdom of God, the Supreme Soul, has illuminated my being. Says Kabeer, I am attuned to His Love.
All the rest of the world is deluded by doubt, while my mind is intoxicated with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||4||3||

## Section 05 - Siree Raag - Part 080

Sree Raag, The Word Of Devotee Baynee Jee:
TO BE SUNG TO THE TUNE OF “PEHRAY”:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O man, when you were coiled in the cradle of the womb, upside-down, you were absorbed in meditation.
You took no pride in your perishable body; night and day were all the same to you-you lived unknowing, in the silence of the void.
Remember the terrible pain and suffering of those days, now that you have spread out the net of your consciousness far and wide.
Leaving the womb, you entered this mortal world; you have forgotten the Lord from your mind. ||1||
Later, you will regret and repent-you fool! Why are you engrossed in evil-mindedness and skepticism?
Think of the Lord, or else you shall be led to the City of Death. Why are you wandering around, out of control? ||1||Pause||
You play like a child, craving sweets; moment by moment, you become more entangled in emotional attachment.
Tasting good and bad, you eat nectar and then poison, and then the five passions appear and torture you.
Abandoning meditation, penance and self-restraint, and the wisdom of good actions, you do not worship and adore the Lord's Name.
You are overflowing with sexual desire, and your intellect is stained with darkness; you are held in the grip of Shakti's power. ||2||
In the heat of youthful passion, you look with desire upon the faces of other men's wives; you do not distinguish between good and evil.
Drunk with sexual desire and other great sins, you go astray, and do not distinguish between vice and virtue.
Gazing upon your children and your property, your mind is proud and arrogant; you cast out the Lord from your heart.
When others die, you measure your own wealth in your mind; you waste your life in the pleasures of the mouth and sexual organs. ||3||
Your hair is whiter than the jasmine flower, and your voice has grown feeble, as if it comes from the seventh underworld.
Your eyes water, and your intellect and strength have left you; but still, your sexual desire churns and drives you on.
And so, your intellect has dried up through corruption, and the lotus flower of your body has wilted and withered.
You have forsaken the Bani, the Word of the Immortal Lord, in this mortal world; in the end, you shall regret and repent. ||4||
Gazing upon the tiny bodies of your children, love has welled up within your heart; you are proud of them, but you do not understand.
You long for the dignity of a long life, but your eyes can no longer see anything.
Your light has gone out, and the bird of your mind has flown away; you are no longer welcome in your own home and courtyard.
Says Baynee, listen, O devotee: who has ever attained liberation after such a death? ||5||
Sree Raag:
You are me, and I am You-what is the difference between us?
We are like gold and the bracelet, or water and the waves. ||1||
If I did not commit any sins, O Infinite Lord,
how would You have acquired the name, ‘Redeemer of sinners’? ||1||Pause||
You are my Master, the Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts.
The servant is known by his God, and the Lord and Master is known by His servant. ||2||
Grant me the wisdom to worship and adore You with my body.
O Ravi Daas, one who understands that the Lord is equally in all, is very rare. ||3||
