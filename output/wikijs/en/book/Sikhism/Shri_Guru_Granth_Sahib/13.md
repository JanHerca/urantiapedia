## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 001

One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:
Death comes to all, and all must suffer separation.
Go and ask the clever people, whether they shall meet in the world hereafter.
Those who forget my Lord and Master shall suffer in terrible pain. ||1||
So praise the True Lord,
by whose Grace peace ever prevails. ||Pause||
Praise Him as great; He is, and He shall ever be.
You alone are the Great Giver; mankind cannot give anything.
Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass; what good does it do to cry out in protest? ||2||
Many have proclaimed their sovereignty over millions of fortresses on the earth, but they have now departed.
And those, whom even the sky could not contain, had ropes put through their noses.
O mind, if you only knew the torment in your future, you would not relish the sweet pleasures of the present. ||3||
O Nanak, as many as are the sins one commits, so many are the chains around his neck.
If he possesses virtues, then the chains are cut away; these virtues are his brothers, his true brothers.
Going to the world hereafter, those who have no Guru are not accepted; they are beaten, and expelled. ||4||1||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House:
Make your mind the farmer, good deeds the farm, modesty the water, and your body the field.
Let the Lord's Name be the seed, contentment the plow, and your humble dress the fence.
Doing deeds of love, the seed shall sprout, and you shall see your home flourish. ||1||
O Baba, the wealth of Maya does not go with anyone.
This Maya has bewitched the world, but only a rare few understand this. ||Pause||
Make your ever-decreasing life your shop, and make the Lord's Name your merchandise.
Make understanding and contemplation your warehouse, and in that warehouse, store the Lord's Name.
Deal with the Lord's dealers, earn your profits, and rejoice in your mind. ||2||
Let your trade be listening to scripture, and let Truth be the horses you take to sell.
Gather up merits for your travelling expenses, and do not think of tomorrow in your mind.
When you arrive in the land of the Formless Lord, you shall find peace in the Mansion of His Presence. ||3||
Let your service be the focusing of your consciousness, and let your occupation be the placing of faith in the Naam.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 002

Let your work be restraint from sin; only then will people call you blessed.
O Nanak, the Lord shall look upon you with His Glance of Grace, and you shall be blessed with honor four times over. ||4||2||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Chau-Tukas:
The son is dear to his mother and father; he is the wise son-in-law to his father-in-law.
The father is dear to his son and daughter, and the brother is very dear to his brother.
By the Order of the Lord's Command, he leaves his house and goes outside, and in an instant, everything becomes alien to him.
The self-willed manmukh does not remember the Name of the Lord, does not give in charity, and does not cleanse his consciousness; his body rolls in the dust. ||1||
The mind is comforted by the Comforter of the Naam.
I fall at the Guru's feet - I am a sacrifice to Him; He has given me to understand the true understanding. ||Pause||
The mind is impressed with the false love of the world; he quarrels with the Lord's humble servant.
Infatuated with Maya, night and day, he sees only the worldly path; he does not chant the Naam, and drinking poison, he dies.
He is imbued and infatuated with vicious talk; the Word of the Shabad does not come into his consciousness.
He is not imbued with the Lord's Love, and he is not impressed by the taste of the Name; the self-willed manmukh loses his honor. ||2||
He does not enjoy celestial peace in the Company of the Holy, and there is not even a bit of sweetness on his tongue.
He calls his mind, body and wealth his own; he has no knowledge of the Court of the Lord.
Closing his eyes, he walks in darkness; he cannot see the home of his own being, O Siblings of Destiny.
Tied up at Death's door, he finds no place of rest; he receives the rewards of his own actions. ||3||
When the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then I see Him with my own eyes; He is indescribable, and cannot be described.
With my ears, I continually listen to the Word of the Shabad, and I praise Him; His Ambrosial Name abides within my heart.
He is Fearless, Formless and absolutely without vengeance; I am absorbed in His Perfect Light.
O Nanak, without the Guru, doubt is not dispelled; through the True Name, glorious greatness is obtained. ||4||3||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Du-Tukas:
In the realm of land, and in the realm of water, Your seat is the chamber of the four directions.
Yours is the one and only form of the entire universe; Your mouth is the mint to fashion all. ||1||
O my Lord Master, Your play is so wonderful!
You are pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; You Yourself are contained in all. ||Pause||
Wherever I look, there I see Your Light, but what is Your form?
You have one form, but it is unseen; there is none like any other. ||2||
The beings born of eggs, born of the womb, born of the earth and born of sweat, all are created by You.
I have seen one glory of Yours, that You are pervading and permeating in all. ||3||
Your Glories are so numerous, and I do not know even one of them; I am such a fool - please, give me some of them!
Prays Nanak, listen, O my Lord Master: I am sinking like a stone - please, save me! ||4||4||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
I am a wicked sinner and a great hypocrite; You are the Immaculate and Formless Lord.
Tasting the Ambrosial Nectar, I am imbued with supreme bliss; O Lord and Master, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||
O Creator Lord, You are the honor of the dishonored.
In my lap is the honor and glory of the wealth of the Name; I merge into the True Word of the Shabad. ||Pause||
You are perfect, while I am worthless and imperfect. You are profound, while I am trivial.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 003

My mind is imbued with You, day and night and morning, O Lord; my tongue chants Your Name, and my mind meditates on You. ||2||
You are True, and I am absorbed into You; through the mystery of the Shabad, I shall ultimately become True as well.
Those who are imbued with the Naam day and night are pure, while those who die to be reborn are impure. ||3||
I do not see any other like the Lord; who else should I praise? No one is equal to Him.
Prays Nanak, I am the slave of His slaves; by Guru's Instruction, I know Him. ||4||5||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
He is unknowable, infinite, unapproachable and imperceptible. He is not subject to death or karma.
His caste is casteless; He is unborn, self-illumined, and free of doubt and desire. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to the Truest of the True.
He has no form, no color and no features; through the True Word of the Shabad, He reveals Himself. ||Pause||
He has no mother, father, sons or relatives; He is free of sexual desire; He has no wife.
He has no ancestry; He is immaculate. He is infinite and endless; O Lord, Your Light is pervading all. ||2||
Deep within each and every heart, God is hidden; His Light is in each and every heart.
The heavy doors are opened by Guru's Instructions; one becomes fearless, in the trance of deep meditation. ||3||
The Lord created all beings, and placed death over the heads of all; all the world is under His Power.
Serving the True Guru, the treasure is obtained; living the Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated. ||4||
In the pure vessel, the True Name is contained; how few are those who practice true conduct.
The individual soul is united with the Supreme Soul; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||5||6||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
Like a fish without water is the faithless cynic, who dies of thirst.
So shall you die, O mind, without the Lord, as your breath goes in vain. ||1||
O mind, chant the Lord's Name, and praise Him.
Without the Guru, how will you obtain this juice? The Guru shall unite you with the Lord. ||Pause||
For the Gurmukh, meeting with the Society of the Saints is like making a pilgrimage to a sacred shrine.
The benefit of bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage is obtained by the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||2||
Like the Yogi without abstinence, and like penance without truth and contentment,
so is the body without the Lord's Name; death will slay it, because of the sin within. ||3||
The faithless cynic does not obtain the Lord's Love; the Lord's Love is obtained only through the True Guru.
One who meets with the Guru, the Giver of pleasure and pain, says Nanak, is absorbed in the Lord's Praise. ||4||7||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
You, God, are the Giver of gifts, the Lord of perfect understanding; I am a mere beggar at Your Door.
What should I beg for? Nothing remains permanent; O Lord, please, bless me with Your Beloved Name. ||1||
In each and every heart, the Lord, the Lord of the forest, is permeating and pervading.
In the water, on the land, and in the sky, He is pervading but hidden; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is revealed. ||Pause||
In this world, in the nether regions of the underworld, and in the Akaashic Ethers, the Guru, the True Guru, has shown me the Lord; He has showered me with His Mercy.
He is the unborn Lord God; He is, and shall ever be. Deep within your heart, behold Him, the Destroyer of ego. ||2||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 004

This wretched world is caught in birth and death; in the love of duality, it has forgotten devotional worship of the Lord.
Meeting the True Guru, the Guru's Teachings are obtained; the faithless cynic loses the game of life. ||3||
Breaking my bonds, the True Guru has set me free, and I shall not be cast into the womb of reincarnation again.
O Nanak, the jewel of spiritual wisdom shines forth, and the Lord, the Formless Lord, dwells within my mind. ||4||8||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
The treasure of the Name, for which you have come into the world - that Ambrosial Nectar is with the Guru.
Renounce costumes, disguises and clever tricks; this fruit is not obtained by duplicity. ||1||
O my mind, remain steady, and do not wander away.
By searching around on the outside, you shall only suffer great pain; the Ambrosial Nectar is found within the home of your own being. ||Pause||
Renounce corruption, and seek virtue; committing sins, you shall only come to regret and repent.
You do not know the difference between good and evil; again and again, you sink into the mud. ||2||
Within you is the great filth of greed and falsehood; why do you bother to wash your body on the outside?
Chant the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord always, under Guru's Instruction; only then will your innermost being be emancipated. ||3||
Let greed and slander be far away from you, and renounce falsehood; through the True Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall obtain the true fruit.
As it pleases You, You preserve me, Dear Lord; servant Nanak sings the Praises of Your Shabad. ||4||9||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Panch-Padas:
You cannot save your own home from being plundered; why do you spy on the houses of others?
That Gurmukh who joins himself to the Guru's service, saves his own home, and tastes the Lord's Nectar. ||1||
O mind, you must realize what your intellect is focused on.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is involved with other tastes; the unfortunate wretch shall come to regret it in the end. ||Pause||
When things come, he is pleased, but when they go, he weeps and wails; this pain and pleasure remains attached to him.
The Lord Himself causes him to enjoy pleasure and endure pain; the Gurmukh, however, remains unaffected. ||2||
What else can be said to be above the subtle essence of the Lord? One who drinks it in is satisfied and satiated.
One who is lured by Maya loses this juice; that faithless cynic is tied to his evil-mindedness. ||3||
The Lord is the life of the mind, the Master of the breath of life; the Divine Lord is contained in the body.
If You so bless us, Lord, then we sing Your Praises; the mind is satisfied and fulfilled, lovingly attached to the Lord. ||4||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the subtle essence of the Lord is obtained; meeting the Guru, the fear of death departs.
O Nanak, chant the Name of the Lord, as Gurmukh; you shall obtain the Lord, and realize your pre-ordained destiny. ||5||10||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
Destiny, pre-ordained by the Lord, looms over the heads of all beings; no one is without this pre-ordained destiny.
Only He Himself is beyond destiny; creating the creation by His creative power, He beholds it, and causes His Command to be followed. ||1||
O mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and be at peace.
Day and night, serve at the Guru's feet; the Lord is the Giver, and the Enjoyer. ||Pause||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 005

He is within - see Him outside as well; there is no one, other than Him.
As Gurmukh, look upon all with the single eye of equality; in each and every heart, the Divine Light is contained. ||2||
Restrain your fickle mind, and keep it steady within its own home; meeting the Guru, this understanding is obtained.
Seeing the unseen Lord, you shall be amazed and delighted; forgetting your pain, you shall be at peace. ||3||
Drinking in the ambrosial nectar, you shall attain the highest bliss, and dwell within the home of your own self.
So sing the Praises of the Lord, the Destroyer of the fear of birth and death, and you shall not be reincarnated again. ||4||
The essence, the immaculate Lord, the Light of all - I am He and He is me - there is no difference between us.
The Infinite Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God - Nanak has met with Him, the Guru. ||5||11||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When I am pleasing to Him, then I sing His Praises.
Singing His Praises, I receive the fruits of my rewards.
The rewards of singing His Praises are obtained when He Himself gives them. ||1||
O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the treasure is obtained;
this is why I remain immersed in the True Name. ||Pause||
When I awoke within myself to the Guru's Teachings,
then I renounced my fickle intellect.
When the Light of the Guru's Teachings dawned,
and then all darkness was dispelled. ||2||
When the mind is attached to the Guru's Feet,
then the Path of Death recedes.
Through the Fear of God, one attains the Fearless Lord;
then, one enters the home of celestial bliss. ||3||
Prays Nanak, how rare are those who reflect and understand,
the most sublime action in this world.
The noblest deed is to sing the Lord's Praises,
and so meet the Lord Himself. ||4||1||12||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
All of Your servants, who relish the Word of Your Shabad, serve You.
By Guru's Grace, they become pure, eradicating self-conceit from within.
Night and day, they continually sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord; they are adorned with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, I am Your child; I seek Your Sanctuary.
You are the One and Only Lord, the Truest of the True; You Yourself are the Destroyer of ego. ||Pause||
Those who remain wakeful obtain God; through the Word of the Shabad, they conquer their ego.
Immersed in family life, the Lord's humble servant ever remains detached; he reflects upon the essence of spiritual wisdom.
Serving the True Guru, he finds eternal peace, and he keeps the Lord enshrined in his heart. ||2||
This mind wanders in the ten directions; it is consumed by the love of duality.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 006

The foolish self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord's Name; he wastes away his life in vain.
But when he meets the True Guru, then he obtains the Name; he sheds egotism and emotional attachment. ||3||
The Lord's humble servants are True - they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The True Lord God unites them with Himself, and they keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts.
O Nanak, through the Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone is my wealth. ||4||1||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
The True Lord has blessed His devotees with the treasure of devotional worship, and the wealth of the Lord's Name.
The wealth of the Naam, shall never be exhausted; no one can estimate its worth.
With the wealth of the Naam, their faces are radiant, and they attain the True Lord. ||1||
O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found.
Without the Shabad, the world wanders around, and receives its punishment in the Court of the Lord. ||Pause||
Within this body dwell the five thieves: sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and egotism.
They plunder the Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh does not realize it; no one hears his complaint.
The world is blind, and its dealings are blind as well; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. ||2||
Indulging in egotism and possessiveness, they are ruined; when they depart, nothing goes along with them.
But one who becomes Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and ever contemplates the Lord's Name.
Through the True Word of Gurbani, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace, he is enraptured. ||3||
The spiritual wisdom of the True Guru is a steady light within the heart. The Lord's decree is over the heads of even kings.
Night and day, the Lord's devotees worship Him; night and day, they gather in the true profit of the Lord's Name.
O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated; attuned to the Shabad, he finds the Lord. ||4||2||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
If one becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves, then he finds the Lord, and eradicates ego from within.
The Lord of bliss is his object of devotion; night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, the Lord's devotees remain ever as one, absorbed in the Lord. ||1||
O Dear Lord, Your Glance of Grace is True.
Show mercy to Your slave, O Beloved Lord, and preserve my honor. ||Pause||
Continually praising the Word of the Shabad, I live; under Guru's Instruction, my fear has been dispelled.
My True Lord God is so beautiful! Serving the Guru, my consciousness is focused on Him.
One who chants the True Word of the Shabad, and the Truest of the True, the Word of His Bani, remains wakeful, day and night. ||2||
He is so very deep and profound, the Giver of eternal peace; no one can find His limit.
Serving the Perfect Guru, one becomes carefree, enshrining the Lord within the mind.
The mind and body become immaculately pure, and a lasting peace fills the heart; doubt is eradicated from within. ||3||
The Way of the Lord is always such a difficult path; only a few find it, contemplating the Guru.
Imbued with the Lord's Love, and intoxicated with the Shabad, he renounces ego and corruption.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, and the Love of the One Lord, he is embellished with the Word of the Shabad. ||4||3||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 007

Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
Dear Beloved Lord, I praise You continually, as long as there is the breath within my body.
If I were to forget You, for a moment, even for an instant, O Lord Master, it would be like fifty years for me.
I was always such a fool and an idiot, O Siblings of Destiny, but now, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, my mind is enlightened. ||1||
Dear Lord, You Yourself bestow understanding.
Dear Lord, I am forever a sacrifice to You; I am dedicated and devoted to Your Name. ||Pause||
I have died in the Word of the Shabad, and through the Shabad, I am dead while yet alive, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Shabad, I have been liberated.
Through the Shabad, my mind and body have been purified, and the Lord has come to dwell within my mind.
The Guru is the Giver of the Shabad; my mind is imbued with it, and I remain absorbed in the Lord. ||2||
Those who do not know the Shabad are blind and deaf; why did they even bother to come into the world?
They do not obtain the subtle essence of the Lord's elixir; they waste away their lives, and are reincarnated over and over again.
The blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukhs are like maggots in manure, and in manure they rot away. ||3||
The Lord Himself creates us, watches over us, and places us on the Path, O Siblings of Destiny; there is no one other than Him.
No one can erase that which is pre-ordained, O Siblings of Destiny; whatever the Creator wills, comes to pass.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the mind; O Siblings of Destiny, there is no other at all. ||4||4||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukhs practice devotional worship, and become pleasing to God; night and day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
You Yourself protect and take care of Your devotees, who are pleasing to Your Mind.
You are the Giver of virtue, realized through the Word of Your Shabad. Uttering Your Glories, we merge with You, O Glorious Lord. ||1||
O my mind, remember always the Dear Lord.
At the very last moment, He alone shall be your best friend; He shall always stand by you. ||Pause||
The gathering of the wicked enemies shall always practice falsehood; they do not contemplate understanding.
Who can obtain fruit from the slander of evil enemies? Remember that Harnaakhash was torn apart by the Lord's claws.
Prahlaad, the Lord's humble servant, constantly sang the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and the Dear Lord saved him. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs see themselves as being very virtuous; they have absolutely no understanding at all.
They indulge in slander of the humble spiritual people; they waste their lives away, and then they have to depart.
They never think of the Lord's Name, and in the end, they depart, regretting and repenting. ||3||
The Lord makes the lives of His devotees fruitful; He Himself links them to the Guru's service.
Imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and intoxicated with celestial bliss, night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Slave Nanak utters this prayer: O Lord, please, let me fall at their feet. ||4||5||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
He alone is a Sikh, a friend, a relative and a sibling, who walks in the Way of the Guru's Will.
One who walks according to his own will, O Siblings of Destiny, suffers separation from the Lord, and shall be punished.
Without the True Guru, peace is never obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; again and again, he regrets and repents. ||1||
The Lord's slaves are happy, O Siblings of Destiny.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 008

The sins and sorrows of countless lifetimes are eradicated; the Lord Himself unites them in His Union. ||Pause||
All of these relatives are like chains upon the soul, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is deluded by doubt.
Without the Guru, the chains cannot be broken; the Gurmukhs find the door of salvation.
One who performs rituals without realizing the Word of the Guru's Shabad, shall die and be reborn, again and again. ||2||
The world is entangled in egotism and possessiveness, O Siblings of Destiny, but no one belongs to anyone else.
The Gurmukhs attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, singing the Glories of the Lord; they dwell in the home of their own inner being.
One who understands here, realizes himself; the Lord God belongs to him. ||3||
The True Guru is forever merciful, O Siblings of Destiny; without good destiny, what can anyone obtain?
He looks alike upon all with His Glance of Grace, but people receive the fruits of their rewards according to their love for the Lord.
O Nanak, when the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind, then self-conceit is eradicated from within. ||4||6||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Chau-Tukas:
True devotional worship is obtained only through the True Guru, when the True Word of His Bani is in the heart.
Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained; egotism is obliterated through the Word of the Shabad.
Without the Guru, there is no true devotion; otherwise, people wander around, deluded by ignorance.
The self-willed manmukhs wander around, suffering in constant pain; they drown and die, even without water. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, remain forever in the Lord's Sanctuary, under His Protection.
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He preserves our honor, and blesses us with the glory of the Lord's Name. ||Pause||
Through the Perfect Guru, one comes to understand himself, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.
The Lord, the Life of the world, ever abides in his heart, and he renounces sexual desire, anger and egotism.
The Lord is ever-present, permeating and pervading all places; the Name of the Infinite Lord is enshrined within the heart.
Throughout the ages, through the Word of His Bani, His Shabad is realized, and the Name becomes so sweet and beloved to the mind. ||2||
Serving the Guru, one realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord; fruitful is his life, and his coming into the world.
Tasting the sublime elixir of the Lord, his mind is satisfied and satiated forever; singing the Glories of the Glorious Lord, he is fulfilled and satisfied.
The lotus of his heart blossoms forth, he is ever imbued with the Lord's Love, and the unstruck melody of the Shabad resounds within him.
His body and mind become immaculately pure; his speech becomes immaculate as well, and he merges in the Truest of the True. ||3||
No one knows the state of the Lord's Name; through the Guru's Teachings, it comes to abide in the heart.
One who becomes Gurmukh, understands the Path; his tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord's Nectar.
Meditation, austere self-discipline and self-restraint are all obtained from the Guru; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to abide within the heart.
O Nanak, those humble beings who praise the Naam are beautiful; they are honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||4||7||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Du-Tukas:
Meeting the True Guru, one turns away from the world, O Siblings of Destiny; when he remains dead while yet alive, he obtains true understanding.
He alone is the Guru, and he alone is a Sikh, O Siblings of Destiny, whose light merges in the Light. ||1||
O my mind, be lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, it seems so sweet to the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; the Gurmukhs obtain a place in the Court of the Lord. ||Pause||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 009

Without the Guru, love for the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny; the self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in the love of duality.
Actions performed by the manmukh are like the threshing of the chaff - they obtain nothing for their efforts. ||2||
Meeting the Guru, the Naam comes to permeate the mind, O Siblings of Destiny, with true love and affection.
He always sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, with infinite love for the Guru. ||3||
How blessed and approved is his coming into the world, O Siblings of Destiny, who focuses his mind on serving the Guru.
O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is obtained, O Siblings of Destiny, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and we merge with the Lord. ||4||8||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:
The three worlds are entangled in the three qualities, O Siblings of Destiny; the Guru imparts understanding.
Attached to the Lord's Name, one is emancipated, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the wise ones about this. ||1||
O mind, renounce the three qualities, and focus your consciousness on the fourth state.
The Dear Lord abides in the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; ever sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||Pause||
From the Naam, everyone originated, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the Naam, they die away.
The ignorant world is blind, O Siblings of Destiny; those who sleep are plundered. ||2||
Those Gurmukhs who remain awake are saved, O Siblings of Destiny; they cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
In this world, the Name of the Lord is the true profit, O Siblings of Destiny; keep it enshrined within your heart. ||3||
In the Guru's Sanctuary, O Siblings of Destiny, you shall be saved; be lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name.
O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is the boat, and the Name is the raft, O Siblings of Destiny; setting out on it, the Lord's humble servant crosses over the world-ocean. ||4||9||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:
The True Guru is the ocean of peace in the world; there is no other place of rest and peace.
The world is afflicted with the painful disease of egotism; dying, only to be reborn, it cries out in pain. ||1||
O mind, serve the True Guru, and obtain peace.
If you serve the True Guru, you shall find peace; otherwise, you shall depart, after wasting away your life in vain. ||Pause||
Led around by the three qualities, he does many deeds, but he does not come to taste and savor the subtle essence of the Lord.
He says his evening prayers, and makes offerings of water, and recites his morning prayers, but without true understanding, he still suffers in pain. ||2||
One who serves the True Guru is very fortunate; as the Lord so wills, he meets with the Guru.
Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, His humble servants remain ever satisfied; they eradicate self-conceit from within themselves. ||3||
This world is blind, and all act blindly; without the Guru, no one finds the Path.
O Nanak, meeting with the True Guru, one sees with his eyes, and finds the True Lord within the home of his own being. ||4||10||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
Without serving the True Guru, he suffers in terrible pain, and throughout the four ages, he wanders aimlessly.
I am poor and meek, and throughout the ages, You are the Great Giver - please, grant me the understanding of the Shabad. ||1||
O Dear Beloved Lord, please show mercy to me.
Unite me in the Union of the True Guru, the Great Giver, and give me the support of the Lord's Name. ||Pause||
Conquering my desires and duality, I have merged in celestial peace, and I have found the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord.
I have tasted the sublime essence of the Lord, and my soul has become immaculately pure; the Lord is the Destroyer of sins. ||2||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 010

Dying in the Word of the Shabad, you shall live forever, and you shall never die again.
The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam is ever-sweet to the mind; but how few are those who obtain the Shabad. ||3||
The Great Giver keeps His Gifts in His Hand; He gives them to those with whom He is pleased.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, they find peace, and in the Court of the Lord, they are exalted. ||4||11||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
Serving the True Guru, the divine melody wells up within, and one is blessed with wisdom and salvation.
The True Name of the Lord comes to abide in the mind, and through the Name, one merges in the Name. ||1||
Without the True Guru, the whole world is insane.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not realize the Word of the Shabad; they are deluded by false doubts. ||Pause||
The three-faced Maya had led them astray in doubt, and they are snared by the noose of egotism.
Birth and death hang over their heads, and being reborn from the womb, they suffer in pain. ||2||
The three qualities permeate the whole world; acting in ego, it loses its honor.
But one who becomes Gurmukh comes to realize the fourth state of celestial bliss; he finds peace through the Name of the Lord. ||3||
The three qualities are all Yours, O Lord; You Yourself created them. Whatever You do, comes to pass.
O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated; through the Shabad, he is rid of egotism. ||4||12||

He Himself is the thread, and He Himself is the many beads; through His Almighty Power, He has strung the worlds.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 011

He holds the thread, and when He withdraws the thread, the beads scatter into heaps. ||1||

The Beloved Himself beholds, and rejoices; God Himself works wonders, and beholds them.
The Beloved Himself is contained in all the woods and meadows; as Gurmukh, He reveals Himself. ||1||

The Beloved Himself fashioned the world, and He Himself counter-balances it with a gram. ||1||

The Beloved Himself is the earth, and He Himself is the water; He Himself acts, and causes others to act.
The Beloved Himself issues His Commands, and keeps the water and the land bound down.
The Beloved Himself instills the Fear of God; He binds the tiger and the goat together. ||2||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 012

Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, Du-Tukas:
Separated from the Lord for countless lifetimes, the self-willed manmukh suffers in pain, engaged in acts of egotism.
Beholding the Holy Saint, I found God; O Lord of the Universe, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||
The Love of God is very dear to me.
When I joined the Sat Sangat, the Company of the Holy People, the Lord, the embodiment of peace, came into my heart. ||Pause||
You dwell, hidden, within my heart day and night, Lord; but the poor fools do not understand Your Love.
Meeting with the Almighty True Guru, God was revealed to me; I sing His Glorious Praises, and reflect upon His Glories. ||2||
As Gurmukh, I have become enlightened; peace has come, and evil-mindedness has been dispelled from my mind.
Understanding the relationship of the individual soul with God, I have found peace, in Your Sat Sangat, Your True Congregation, O Lord. ||3||
Those who are blessed by Your Kind Mercy, meet the Almighty Lord, and find the Guru.
Nanak has found the immeasurable, celestial peace; night and day, he remains awake to the Lord, the Master of the Forest of the Universe. ||4||7||
Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:
The inner depths of my mind are pierced by love for the Lord; I cannot live without the Lord.
Just as the fish dies without water, I die without the Lord's Name. ||1||
O my God, please bless me with the water of Your Name.
I beg for Your Name, deep within myself, day and night; through the Name, I find peace. ||Pause||
The song-bird cries out for lack of water - without water, its thirst cannot be quenched.
The Gurmukh obtains the water of celestial bliss, and is rejuvenated, blossoming forth through the blessed Love of the Lord. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs are hungry, wandering around in the ten directions; without the Name, they suffer in pain.
They are born, only to die, and enter into reincarnation again; in the Court of the Lord, they are punished. ||3||
But if the Lord shows His Mercy, then one comes to sing His Glorious Praises; deep within the nucleus of his own self, he finds the sublime essence of the Lord's elixir.
The Lord has become Merciful to meek Nanak, and through the Word of the Shabad, his desires are quenched. ||4||8||
Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, Panch-Padas:
If one eats the uneatable, then he becomes a Siddha, a being of perfect spirituality; through this perfection, he obtains wisdom.
When the arrow of the Lord's Love pierces his body, then his doubt is eradicated. ||1||
O my Lord of the Universe, please bless Your humble servant with glory.
Under Guru's Instructions, enlighten me with the Lord's Name, that I may dwell forever in Your Sanctuary. ||Pause||
This whole world is engrossed in coming and going; O my foolish and ignorant mind, be mindful of the Lord.
O Dear Lord, please, take pity upon me, and unite me with the Guru, that I may merge in the Lord's Name. ||2||
Only one who has it knows God; he alone has it, to whom God has given it - so very beautiful, unapproachable and unfathomable. Through the Perfect Guru, the unknowable is known. ||3||
Only one who tastes it knows it, like the mute, who tastes the sweet candy, but cannot speak of it.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 014

The jewel is concealed, but it is not concealed, even though one may try to conceal it. ||4||
Everything is Yours, O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts; You are the Lord God of all.
He alone receives the gift, unto whom You give it; O servant Nanak, there is no one else. ||5||9||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House, Ti-Tukas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Who should I ask? Who should I worship? All were created by Him.
Whoever appears to be the greatest of the great, shall ultimately be mixed with the dust.
The Fearless, Formless Lord, the Destroyer of Fear bestows all comforts, and the nine treasures. ||1||
O Dear Lord, Your gifts alone satisfy me.
Why should I praise the poor helpless man? Why should I feel subservient to him? ||Pause||
All things come to one who meditates on the Lord; the Lord satisfies his hunger.
The Lord, the Giver of peace, bestows such wealth, that it can never be exhausted.
I am in ecstasy, absorbed in celestial peace; the True Guru has united me in His Union. ||2||
O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; worship the Naam, night and day, and recite the Naam.
Listen to the Teachings of the Holy Saints, and all fear of death will be dispelled.
Those blessed by God's Grace are attached to the Word of the Guru's Bani. ||3||
Who can estimate Your worth, God? You are kind and compassionate to all beings.
Everything which You do, prevails; I am just a poor child - what can I do?
Protect and preserve Your servant Nanak; be kind to him, like a father to his son. ||4||1||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House, Chau-Tukas:
Praise the Guru, and the Lord of the Universe, O Siblings of Destiny; enshrine Him in your mind, body and heart.
Let the True Lord and Master abide in your mind, O Siblings of Destiny; this is the most excellent way of life.
Those bodies, in which the Name of the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny - those bodies are reduced to ashes.
I am a sacrifice to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Siblings of Destiny; they take the Support of the One and Only Lord. ||1||
So worship and adore that True Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; He alone does everything.
The Perfect Guru has taught me, O Siblings of Destiny, that without Him, there is no other at all. ||Pause||
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they putrefy and die, O Siblings of Destiny; their numbers cannot be counted.
Without Truth, purity cannot be achieved, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is true and unfathomable.
Coming and going do not end, O Siblings of Destiny; pride in worldly valuables is false.
The Gurmukh saves millions of people, O Siblings of Destiny, blessing them with even a particle of the Name. ||2||
I have searched through the Simritees and the Shaastras, O Siblings of Destiny - without the True Guru, doubt does not depart.
They are so tired of performing their many deeds, O Siblings of Destiny, but they fall into bondage again and again.
I have searched in the four directions, O Siblings of Destiny, but without the True Guru, there is no place at all.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 015

By great good fortune, I found the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, and I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
The Truth is forever pure, O Siblings of Destiny; those who are true are pure.
When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, O Siblings of Destiny, then one obtains Him.
Among millions, O Siblings of Destiny, hardly one humble servant of the Lord is found.
Nanak is imbued with the True Name, O Siblings of Destiny; hearing it, the mind and body become immaculately pure. ||4||2||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Du-Tukas:
As long as this person believes in love and hate, it is difficult for him to meet the Lord.
As long as he discriminates between himself and others, he will distance himself from the Lord. ||1||
O Lord, grant me such understanding,
that I might serve the Holy Saints, and seek the protection of their feet, and not forget them, for a moment, even an instant. ||Pause||
O foolish, thoughtless and fickle mind, such understanding did not come into your heart.
Renouncing the Lord of Life, you have become engrossed in other things, and you are involved with your enemies. ||2||
Sorrow does not afflict one who does not harbor self-conceit; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have attained this understanding.
Know that the babbling of the faithless cynic is like wind passing by. ||3||
This mind is inundated by millions of sins - what can I say?
Nanak, Your humble servant has come to Your Sanctuary, God; please, erase all his accounts. ||4||3||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Children, spouses, men and women in one's household, are all bound by Maya.
At the very last moment, none of them shall stand by you; their love is totally false. ||1||
O man, why do you pamper your body so?
It shall disperse like a cloud of smoke; vibrate upon the One, the Beloved Lord. ||Pause||
There are three ways in which the body can be consumed - it can be thrown into water, given to the dogs, or cremated to ashes.
He considers himself to be immortal; he sits in his home, and forgets the Lord, the Cause of causes. ||2||
In various ways, the Lord has fashioned the beads, and strung them on a slender thread.
The thread shall break, O wretched man, and then, you shall repent and regret. ||3||
He created you, and after creating you, He adorned you - meditate on Him day and night.
God has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; I hold tight to the Support of the True Guru. ||4||4||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
I met the True Guru, by great good fortune, and my mind has been enlightened.
No one else can equal me, because I have the loving support of my Lord and Master. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.
I am at peace in this world, and I shall be in celestial peace in the next; my home is filled with bliss. ||Pause||
He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Creator, my Lord and Master.
I have become fearless, attached to the Guru's feet; I take the Support of the Name of the One Lord. ||2||
Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; the Form of God is deathless; He is and shall always be.
He hugs His humble servants close, and protects and preserves them; their love for Him is sweet to Him. ||3||
Great is His glorious greatness, and wondrous is His magnificence; through Him, all affairs are resolved.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 016

Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru; all his sorrows have been dispelled. ||4||5||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
To the happy person, everyone seems happy; to the sick person, everyone seems sick.
The Lord and Master acts, and causes us to act; union is in His Hands. ||1||
O my mind, no one appears to be mistaken, to one who has dispelled his own doubts; he realizes that everyone is God. ||Pause||
One whose mind is comforted in the Society of the Saints, believes that all are joyful.
One whose mind is afflicted by the disease of egotism, cries out in birth and death. ||2||
Everything is clear to one whose eyes are blessed with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.
In the darkness of spiritual ignorance, he sees nothing at all; he wanders around in reincarnation, over and over again. ||3||
Hear my prayer, O Lord and Master; Nanak begs for this happiness:
whereever Your Holy Saints sing the Kirtan of Your Praises, let my mind be attached to that place. ||4||6||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
My body belongs to the Saints, my wealth belongs to the Saints, and my mind belongs to the Saints.
By the Grace of the Saints, I meditate on the Lord's Name, and then, all comforts come to me. ||1||
Without the Saints, there are no other givers.
Whoever takes to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, is carried across. ||Pause||
Millions of sins are erased by serving the humble Saints, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with love.
One finds peace in this world, and one's face is radiant in the next world, by associating with the humble Saints, through great good fortune. ||2||
I have only one tongue, and the Lord's humble servant is filled with countless virtues; how can I sing his praises?
The inaccessible, unapproachable and eternally unchanging Lord is obtained in the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||3||
I am worthless, lowly, without friends or support, and full of sins; I long for the Shelter of the Saints.
I am drowning in the deep, dark pit of household attachments - please save me, Lord! ||4||7||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House:
O Creator Lord, You fulfill the desires of those, within whose heart You abide.
Your slaves do not forget You; the dust of Your feet is pleasing to their minds. ||1||
Your Unspoken Speech cannot be spoken.
O treasure of excellence, Giver of peace, Lord and Master, Your greatness is the highest of all. ||Pause||
The mortal does those deeds, and those alone, which You ordained by destiny.
Your servant, whom You bless with Your service, is satisfied and fulfilled, beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||2||
You are contained in all, but he alone realizes this, whom You bless with understanding.
By Guru's Grace, his spiritual ignorance is dispelled, and he is respected everywhere. ||3||
He alone is spiritually enlightened, he alone is a meditator, and he alone is a man of good nature.
Says Nanak, one unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful, does not forget the Lord from his mind. ||4||8||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
The whole creation is engrossed in emotional attachment; sometimes, one is high, and at other times, low.
No one can be purified by any rituals or devices; they cannot reach their goal. ||1||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 017

O my mind, emancipation is attained in the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints.
Without the Perfect Guru, births and deaths do not cease, and one comes and goes, over and over again. ||Pause||
The whole world is entangled in what is called the delusion of doubt.
The perfect devotee of the Primal Lord God remains detached from everything. ||2||
Don't indulge in slander for any reason, for everything is the creation of the Lord and Master.
One who is blessed with the Mercy of my God, dwells on the Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||
The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, the True Guru, saves all.
Says Nanak, without the Guru, no one crosses over; this is the perfect essence of all contemplation. ||4||9||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
I have searched and searched and searched, and found that the Lord's Name is the most sublime reality.
Contemplating it for even an instant, sins are erased; the Gurmukh is carried across and saved. ||1||
Drink in the sublime essence of the Lord's Name, O man of spiritual wisdom.
Listening to the Ambrosial Words of the Holy Saints, the mind finds absolute fulfillment and satisfaction. ||Pause||
Liberation, pleasures, and the true way of life are obtained from the Lord, the Giver of all peace.
The Perfect Lord, the Architect of Destiny, blesses His slave with the gift of devotional worship. ||2||
Hear with your ears, and sing with your tongue, and meditate within your heart on Him.
The Lord and Master is all-powerful, the Cause of causes; without Him, there is nothing at all. ||3||
By great good fortune, I have obtained the jewel of human life; have mercy on me, O Merciful Lord.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and contemplates Him forever in meditation. ||4||10||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
After taking your cleansing bath, remember your God in meditation, and your mind and body shall be free of disease.
Millions of obstacles are removed, in the Sanctuary of God, and good fortune dawns. ||1||
The Word of God's Bani, and His Shabad, are the best utterances.
So constantly sing them, listen to them, and read them, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Perfect Guru shall save you. ||Pause||
The glorious greatness of the True Lord is immeasurable; the Merciful Lord is the Lover of His devotees.
He has preserved the honor of His Saints; from the very beginning of time, His Nature is to cherish them. ||2||
So eat the Ambrosial Name of the Lord as your food; put it into your mouth at all times.
The pains of old age and death shall all depart, when you constantly sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. ||3||
My Lord and Master has heard my prayer, and all my affairs have been resolved.
The glorious greatness of Guru Nanak is manifest, throughout all the ages. ||4||11||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The One God is our father; we are the children of the One God. You are our Guru.
Listen, friends: my soul is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You; O Lord, reveal to me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 018

Listen, friends: I am a sacrifice to the dust of Your feet.
This mind is yours, O Siblings of Destiny. ||Pause||
I wash your feet, I massage and clean them; I give this mind to you.
Listen, friends: I have come to Your Sanctuary; teach me, that I might unite with God. ||2||
Do not be proud; seek His Sanctuary, and accept as good all that He does.
Listen, friends: dedicate your soul, body and your whole being to Him; thus you shall receive the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||3||
He has shown mercy to me, by the Grace of the Saints; the Lord's Name is sweet to me.
The Guru has shown mercy to servant Nanak; I see the casteless, immaculate Lord everywhere. ||4||1||12||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
God is the Lord and Master of millions of universes; He is the Giver of all beings.
He ever cherishes and cares for all beings, but the fool does not appreciate any of His virtues. ||1||
I do not know how to worship the Lord in adoration.
I can only repeat, “Lord, Lord, Guru, Guru.”
O Dear Lord, I go by the name of the Lord's slave. ||Pause||
The Compassionate Lord is Merciful to the meek, the ocean of peace; He fills all hearts.
He sees, hears, and is always with me; but I am a fool, and I think that He is far away. ||2||
The Lord is limitless, but I can only describe Him within my limitations; what do I know, about what He is like?
I offer my prayer to my True Guru; I am so foolish - please, teach me! ||3||
I am just a fool, but millions of sinners just like me have been saved.
Those who have heard, and seen Guru Nanak, do not descend into the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||2||13||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Those things, which caused me such anxiety, have all vanished.
Now, I sleep in peace and tranquility, and my mind is in a state of deep and profound peace; the inverted lotus of my heart has blossomed forth. ||1||
Behold, a wondrous miracle has happened!
That Lord and Master, whose wisdom is said to be unfathomable, has been enshrined within my heart, by the Guru. ||Pause||
The demons which tormented me so much, have themselves become terrified.
They pray: please, save us from your Lord Master; we seek your protection. ||2||
When the treasure of the Lord of the Universe is opened, those who are pre-destined, receive it.
The Guru has given me the one jewel, and my mind and body have become peaceful and tranquil. ||3||
The Guru has blessed me with the one drop of Ambrosial Nectar, and so I have become stable, unmoving and immortal - I shall not die.
The Lord blessed Guru Nanak with the treasure of devotional worship, and did not call him to account again. ||4||3||14||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Those whose minds are attached to the lotus feet of the Lord - those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled.
But those, within whose hearts the priceless virtue does not abide - those men remain thirsty and unsatisfied. ||1||
Worshipping the Lord in adoration, one becomes happy, and free of disease.
But one who forgets my Dear Lord - know him to be afflicted with tens of thousands of illnesses. ||Pause||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 019

Those who hold tightly to Your Support, God, are happy in Your Sanctuary.
But those humble beings who forget the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, are counted among the most miserable beings. ||2||
One who has faith in the Guru, and who is lovingly attached to God, enjoys the delights of supreme ecstasy.
One who forgets God and forsakes the Guru, falls into the most horrible hell. ||3||
As the Lord engages someone, so he is engaged, and so does he perform.
Nanak has taken to the Shelter of the Saints; his heart is absorbed in the Lord's feet. ||4||4||15||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
As the king is entangled in kingly affairs, and the egotist in his own egotism,
and the greedy man is enticed by greed, so is the spiritually enlightened being absorbed in the Love of the Lord. ||1||
This is what befits the Lord's servant.
Beholding the Lord near at hand, he serves the True Guru, and he is satisfied through the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||Pause||
The addict is addicted to his drug, and the landlord is in love with his land.

Says Nanak, remember the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all desires, and you too shall be carried across and saved. ||3||4||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
What efforts should the mortal make,
to attain devotional worship of the Lord, and eradicate the fear of death? ||1||Pause||
Which actions, what sort of knowledge, and what religion - what Dharma should one practice?
What Name of the Guru should one remember in meditation, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean? ||1||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of the One Lord is the treasure of mercy; chanting it, one obtains salvation.
No other religion is comparable to this; so speak the Vedas. ||2||
He is beyond pain and pleasure, forever unattached; He is called the Lord of the world.
He dwells deep within your inner self, O Nanak, like the image in a mirror. ||3||5||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
O mother, how can I see the Lord of the world?
In the utter darkness of emotional attachment and spiritual ignorance, my mind remains entangled. ||1||Pause||
Deluded by doubt, I have wasted my whole life; I have not obtained a stable intellect.
I remain under the influence of corrupting sins, night and day, and I have not renounced wickedness. ||1||
I never joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and I did not sing the Kirtan of God's Praises.
O servant Nanak, I have no virtues at all; keep me in Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||2||6||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
O mother, my mind is out of control.
Night and day, it runs after sin and corruption. How can I restrain it? ||1||Pause||
He listens to the teachings of the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, but he does not enshrine them in his heart, even for an instant.
Engrossed in the wealth and women of others, his life passes away uselessly. ||1||
He has gone insane with the wine of Maya, and does not understand even a bit of spiritual wisdom.
Deep within his heart, the Immaculate Lord dwells, but he does not know this secret. ||2||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 039

When I came to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, all my evil-mindedness was dispelled.
Then, O Nanak, I remembered the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all desires, and the noose of Death was snapped. ||3||7||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
O man, grasp this Truth firmly in your soul.
The whole world is just like a dream; it will pass away in an instant. ||1||Pause||
Like a wall of sand, built up and plastered with great care, which does not last even a few days,
just so are the pleasures of Maya. Why are you entangled in them, you ignorant fool? ||1||
Understand this today - it is not yet too late! Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord.
Says Nanak, this is the subtle wisdom of the Holy Saints, which I proclaim out loud to you. ||2||8||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
In this world, I have not found any true friend.
The whole world is attached to its own pleasures, and when trouble comes, no one is with you. ||1||Pause||
Wives, friends, children and relatives - all are attached to wealth.
When they see a poor man, they all forsake his company and run away. ||1||
So what should I say to this crazy mind, which is affectionately attached to them?
The Lord is the Master of the meek, the Destroyer of all fears, and I have forgotten to praise Him. ||2||
Like a dog's tail, which will never straighten out, the mind will not change, no matter how many things are tried.
Says Nanak, please, Lord, uphold the honor of Your innate nature; I chant Your Name. ||3||9||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
O mind, you have not accepted the Guru's Teachings.
What is the use of shaving your head, and wearing saffron robes? ||1||Pause||
Abandoning Truth, you cling to falsehood; your life is uselessly wasting away.
Practicing hypocrisy, you fill your belly, and then sleep like an animal. ||1||
You do not know the Way of the Lord's meditation; you have sold yourself into Maya's hands.
The madman remains entangled in vice and corruption; he has forgotten the jewel of the Naam. ||2||
He remains thoughtless, not thinking of the Lord of the Universe; his life is uselessly passing away.
Says Nanak, O Lord, please, confirm your innate nature; this mortal is continually making mistakes. ||3||10||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
That man, who in the midst of pain, does not feel pain,
who is not affected by pleasure, affection or fear, and who looks alike upon gold and dust;||1||Pause||
Who is not swayed by either slander or praise, nor affected by greed, attachment or pride;
who remains unaffected by joy and sorrow, honor and dishonor;||1||
who renounces all hopes and desires and remains desireless in the world;
who is not touched by sexual desire or anger - within his heart, God dwells. ||2||
That man, blessed by Guru's Grace, understands this way.
O Nanak, he merges with the Lord of the Universe, like water with water. ||3||11||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 040

Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
O dear friend, know this in your mind.
The world is entangled in its own pleasures; no one is for anyone else. ||1||Pause||
In good times, many come and sit together, surrounding you on all four sides.
But when hard times come, they all leave, and no one comes near you. ||1||
Your wife, whom you love so much, and who has remained ever attached to you,
runs away crying, “Ghost! Ghost!”, as soon as the swan-soul leaves this body. ||2||
This is the way they act - those whom we love so much.
At the very last moment, O Nanak, no one is any use at all, except the Dear Lord. ||3||12||139||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees, Chau-Tukas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am not torn by duality, because I do not worship any other than the Lord; I do not visit tombs or crematoriums.
I do not enter the houses of strangers, engrossed in desire. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, has satisfied my desires.
Deep within my heart, the Guru has shown me the home of my being, and my mind is imbued with peace and poise, O Siblings of Destiny.
You Yourself are all-knowing, and You Yourself are all-seeing; You alone bestow intelligence, O Lord. ||1||
My mind is detached, imbued with detachment; the Word of the Shabad has pierced my mind, O my mother.
God's Light shines continually within the nucleus of my deepest self; I am lovingly attached to the Bani, the Word of the True Lord Master. ||Pause||
Countless detached renunciates talk of detachment and renunciation, but he alone is a true renunciate, who is pleasing to the Lord Master.
The Word of the Shabad is ever in his heart; he is absorbed in the Fear of God, and he works to serve the Guru.
He remembers the One Lord, his mind does not waver, and he restrains its wanderings.
He is intoxicated with celestial bliss, and is ever imbued with the Lord's Love; he sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||2||
The mind is like the wind, but if it comes to rest in peace, even for an instant, then he shall abide in the peace of the Name, O Siblings of Destiny.
His tongue, eyes and ears are imbued with Truth; O Lord, You quench the fires of desire.
In hope, the renunciate remains free of hopes; in the home of his own inner self, he is absorbed in the trance of deep meditation.
He remains content, satisfied with the charity of the Naam; he drinks in the Ambrosial Amrit with ease. ||3||
There is no renunciation in duality, as long as there is even a particle of duality.
The whole world is Yours, Lord; You alone are the Giver. There is not any other, O Siblings of Destiny.
The self-willed manmukh dwells in misery forever, while the Lord bestows greatness upon the Gurmukh.
God is infinite, endless, inaccessible and unfathomable; His worth cannot be described. ||4||
The consciousness in deep Samaadhi, the Supreme Being, the Lord of the three worlds - these are Your Names, Lord.
The creatures born into this world have their destiny inscribed upon their foreheads; they experience according to their destinies.
The Lord Himself causes them to do good and bad deeds; He Himself makes them steadfast in devotional worship.
The filth of their mind and mouth is washed off when they live in the Fear of God; the inaccessible Lord Himself blesses them with spiritual wisdom. ||5||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 041

Only those who taste it know its sweet taste, like the mute, who eats the candy, and only smiles.
How can I describe the indescribable, O Siblings of Destiny? I shall follow His Will forever.
If one meets with the Guru, the Generous Giver, then he understands; those who have no Guru cannot understand this.
As the Lord causes us to act, so do we act, O Siblings of Destiny. What other clever tricks can anyone try? ||6||
Some are deluded by doubt, while others are imbued with devotional worship; Your play is infinite and endless.
As You engage them, they receive the fruits of their rewards; You alone are the One who issues Your Commands.
I would serve You, if anything were my own; my soul and body are Yours.
One who meets with the True Guru, by His Grace, takes the Support of the Ambrosial Naam. ||7||
He dwells in the heavenly realms, and his virtues radiantly shine forth; meditation and spiritual wisdom are found in virtue.
The Naam is pleasing to his mind; he speaks it, and causes others to speak it as well. He speaks the essential essence of wisdom.
The Word of the Shabad is his Guru and spiritual teacher, profound and unfathomable; without the Shabad, the world is insane.
He is a perfect renunciate, naturally at ease, O Nanak, whose mind is pleased with the True Lord. ||8||1||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Ti-Tukas:
Hope and desire are entrapments, O Siblings of Destiny. Religious rituals and ceremonies are traps.
Because of good and bad deeds, one is born into the world, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he is ruined.
This Maya is the enticer of the world, O Siblings of Destiny; all such actions are corrupt. ||1||
Listen, O ritualistic Pandit:
that religious ritual which produces happiness, O Siblings of Destiny, is contemplation of the essence of the soul. ||Pause||
You may stand and recite the Shaastras and the Vedas, O Siblings of Destiny, but these are just worldly actions.
Filth cannot be washed away by hypocrisy, O Siblings of Destiny; the filth of corruption and sin is within you.
This is how the spider is destroyed, O Siblings of Destiny, by falling head-long in its own web. ||2||
So many are destroyed by their own evil-mindedness, O Siblings of Destiny; in the love of duality, they are ruined.
Without the True Guru, the Name is not obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, doubt does not depart.
If one serves the True Guru, then he obtains peace, O Siblings of Destiny; his comings and goings are ended. ||3||
True celestial peace comes from the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny; the immaculate mind is absorbed into the True Lord.
One who serves the Guru, understands, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Guru, the way is not found.
What can anyone do, with greed within? O Siblings of Destiny, by telling lies, they eat poison. ||4||
O Pandit, by churning cream, butter is produced.
By churning water, you shall only see water, O Siblings of Destiny; this world is like that.
Without the Guru, he is ruined by doubt, O Siblings of Destiny; the unseen Divine Lord is in each and every heart. ||5||
This world is like a thread of cotton, O Siblings of Destiny, which Maya has tied on all ten sides.
Without the Guru, the knots cannot be untied, O Siblings of Destiny; I am so tired of religious rituals.
This world is deluded by doubt, O Siblings of Destiny; no one can say anything about it. ||6||
Meeting with the Guru, the Fear of God comes to abide in the mind; to die in the Fear of God is one's true destiny.
In the Court of the Lord, the Naam is far superior to ritualistic cleansing baths, charity and good deeds, O Siblings of Destiny.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 042

One who implants the Naam within himself, through the Guru's halter - O Siblings of Destiny, the Lord dwells in his mind, and he is free of hypocrisy. ||7||
This body is the jeweller's shop, O Siblings of Destiny; the incomparable Naam is the merchandise.
The merchant secures this merchandise, O Siblings of Destiny, by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Blessed is the merchant, O Nanak, who meets the Guru, and engages in this trade. ||8||2||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
Those who serve the True Guru, O Beloved, their companions are saved as well.
No one blocks their way, O Beloved, and the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar is on their tongue.
Without the Fear of God, they are so heavy that they sink and drown, O Beloved; but the Lord, casting His Glance of Grace, carries them across. ||1||
I ever praise You, O Beloved, I ever sing Your Praises.
Without the boat, one is drowned in the sea of fear, O Beloved; how can I reach the distant shore? ||1||Pause||
I praise the Praiseworthy Lord, O Beloved; there is no other one to praise.
Those who praise my God are good, O Beloved; they are imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and His Love.
If I join them, O Beloved, I can churn the essence and so find joy. ||2||
The gateway to honor is Truth, O Beloved; it bears the Insignia of the True Name of the Lord.
We come into the world, and we depart, with our destiny written and pre-ordained, O Beloved; realize the Command of the Commander.
Without the Guru, this Command is not understood, O Beloved; True is the Power of the True Lord. ||3||
By His Command, we are conceived, O Beloved, and by His Command, we grow in the womb.
By His Command, we are born, O Beloved, head-first, and upside-down.
The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the Lord, O Beloved; he departs after resolving his affairs. ||4||
By His Command, one comes into the world, O Beloved, and by His Will, he goes.
By His Will, some are bound and gagged and driven away, O Beloved; the self-willed manmukhs suffer their punishment.
By His Command, the Word of the Shabad, is realized, O Beloved, and one goes to the Court of the Lord robed in honor. ||5||
By His Command, some accounts are accounted for, O Beloved; by His Command, some suffer in egotism and duality.
By His Command, one wanders in reincarnation, O Beloved; deceived by sins and demerits, he cries out in his suffering.
If he comes to realize the Command of the Lord's Will, O Beloved, then he is blessed with Truth and Honor. ||6||
It is so difficult to speak it, O Beloved; how can we speak, and hear, the True Name?
I am a sacrifice to those who praise the Lord, O Beloved.
I have obtained the Name, and I am satisfied, O Beloved; by His Grace, I am united in His Union. ||7||
If my body were to become the paper, O Beloved, and my mind the inkpot;
and if my tongue became the pen, O Beloved, I would write, and contemplate, the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.
Blessed is that scribe, O Nanak, who writes the True Name, and enshrines it within his heart. ||8||3||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Du-Tukas:
You are the Giver of virtue, O Immaculate Lord, but my mind is not immaculate, O Siblings of Destiny.
I am a worthless sinner, O Siblings of Destiny; virtue is obtained from You alone, Lord. ||1||
O my Beloved Creator Lord, You create, and You behold.
I am a hypocritical sinner, O Siblings of Destiny. Bless my mind and body with Your Name, O Lord. ||Pause||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 043

The poisonous Maya has enticed the consciousness, O Siblings of Destiny; through clever tricks, one loses his honor.

Beautiful, beautiful, the Lord is called, O Siblings of Destiny; beautiful, like the deep crimson color of the poppy.
If man loves the Lord with detachment, O Siblings of Destiny, he is judged to be true and infallible in the Lord's court and home. ||3||
You are pervading the realms of the underworld and the heavenly skies; Your wisdom and glories are in each and every heart.
Meeting with the Guru, one finds peace, O Siblings of Destiny, and pride is dispelled from the mind. ||4||
Scrubbing with water, the body can be cleaned, O Siblings of Destiny, but the body becomes dirty again.
Bathing in the supreme essence of spiritual wisdom, O Siblings of Destiny, the mind and body become pure. ||5||
Why worship gods and goddesses, O Siblings of Destiny? What can we ask of them? What can they give us?
The stone gods are washed with water, O Siblings of Destiny, but they just sink in the water. ||6||
Without the Guru, the unseen Lord cannot be seen, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is drowning, having lost its honor.
Greatness is in the hands of my Lord and Master, O Siblings of Destiny; as He is pleased, He gives. ||7||
That soul-bride, who talks sweetly and speaks the Truth, O Siblings of Destiny, becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord.
Pierced by His Love, she abides in Truth, O Siblings of Destiny, deeply imbued with the Lord's Name. ||8||
Everyone calls God his own, O Siblings of Destiny, but the all-knowing Lord is known only through the Guru.
Those who are pierced by His Love are saved, O Siblings of Destiny; they bear the Insignia of the True Word of the Shabad. ||9||
A large pile of firewood, O Siblings of Destiny, will burn if a small fire is applied.
In the same way, if the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells in the heart for a moment, even for an instant, O Siblings of Destiny, then one meets the Lord with ease, O Nanak. ||10||4||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House, Ti-Tukas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You always preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Dear Lord; You have protected them from the very beginning of time.
You protected Your servant Prahlaad, O Dear Lord, and annihilated Harnaakhash.
The Gurmukhs place their faith in the Dear Lord, but the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt. ||1||
O Dear Lord, this is Your Glory.
You preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Lord Master; Your devotees seek Your Sanctuary. ||Pause||
The Messenger of Death cannot touch Your devotees; death cannot even approach them.
The Name of the Lord alone abides in their minds; through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they find liberation.
Wealth and all the spiritual powers of the Siddhis fall at the feet of the Lord's devotees; they obtain peace and poise from the Guru. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs have no faith; they are filled with greed and self-interest.
They are not Gurmukh - they do not understand the Word of the Shabad in their hearts; they do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Their masks of falsehood and hypocrisy shall fall off; the self-willed manmukhs speak with insipid words. ||3||
You are pervading through Your devotees, O Dear God; through Your devotees, You are known.
All the people are enticed by Maya; they are Yours, Lord - You alone are the Architect of Destiny.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 044

Overcoming my egotism and quieting the desires within my mind, I have come to realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||4||
God automatically does the work of those who love the Name of the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, he ever dwells in their minds, and He resolves all their affairs.
Whoever challenges them is destroyed; they have the Lord God as their Savior. ||5||
Without serving the True Guru, no one finds the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs die crying out in pain.
They come and go, and find no place of rest; in pain and suffering, they perish.
But one who becomes Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, and is easily absorbed in the True Name. ||6||
Without serving the True Guru, one cannot escape reincarnation, even by performing numerous rituals.
Those who read the Vedas, and argue and debate without the Lord, lose their honor.
True is the True Guru, and True is the Word of His Bani; in the Guru's Sanctuary, one is saved. ||7||
Those whose minds are filled with the Lord are judged as true in the Court of the Lord; they are hailed as true in the True Court.
Their praises echo throughout the ages, and no one can erase them.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those who enshrine the Lord within their hearts. ||8||1||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Du-Tukas:

He has given me the treasure of the Naam; O Siblings of Destiny, through the Guru's Teachings, I am absorbed in celestial bliss. ||4||

Serve the True Guru forever, O Siblings of Destiny, and eradicate self-conceit from within. ||5||
Under Guru's Instruction, the Fear of God is produced, O Siblings of Destiny; true and excellent are the deeds done in the Fear of God.
Then, one is blessed with the treasure of the Lord's Love, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Support of the True Name. ||6||
I fall at the feet of those who serve their True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny.

She who does not know the Will of her Husband Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, is an ill-mannered and bitter bride.
She does things with a stubborn mind, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, she is false. ||3||
They alone sing the Lord's Praises, who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their foreheads, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Love of the True Lord, they find detachment.

He kills and revives all, O Siblings of Destiny; serve Him, day and night.

But if she becomes Gurmukh, then she chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; the meets her True Beloved, and merges in Him. ||6||
In this life, she has not focused her consciousness on the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; how can she show her face when she leaves?
In spite of the warning calls which were sounded, she has been plundered, O Siblings of Destiny; she yearned only for corruption. ||7||

Night and day, he sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, O Beloved, totally filled with Ambrosial Nectar.
He crosses over the sea of pain, O Beloved, and swims across the terrifying world-ocean.
One who is pleasing to His Will, He unites with Himself, O Beloved; he is forever true. ||7||
The all-powerful Divine Lord is compassionate, O Beloved; He is the Support of His devotees.
I seek His Sanctuary, O Beloved; He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
He has adorned me in this world and the next, O Beloved; He has placed the Emblem of Truth upon my forehead.
I shall never forget that God, O Beloved; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||8||2||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
They read scriptures, and contemplate the Vedas; they practice the inner cleansing techniques of Yoga, and control of the breath.
But they cannot escape from the company of the five passions; they are increasingly bound to egotism. ||1||
O Beloved, this is not the way to meet the Lord; I have performed these rituals so many times.
I have collapsed, exhausted, at the Door of my Lord Master; I pray that He may grant me a discerning intellect. ||Pause||
One may remain silent and use his hands as begging bowls, and wander naked in the forest.
He may make pilgrimages to river banks and sacred shrines all over the world, but his sense of duality will not leave him. ||2||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 048

His mind's desires may lead him to go and dwell at sacred places of pilgrimage, and offer his head to be sawn off;
but this will not cause the filth of his mind to depart, even though he may make thousands of efforts. ||3||
He may give gifts of all sorts - gold, women, horses and elephants.
He may make offerings of corn, clothes and land in abundance, but this will not lead him to the Lord's Door. ||4||
He may remain devoted to worship and adoration, bowing his forehead to the floor, practicing the six religious rituals.
He indulges in egotism and pride, and falls into entanglements, but he does not meet the Lord by these devices. ||5||
He practices the eighty-four postures of Yoga, and acquires the supernatural powers of the Siddhas, but he gets tired of practicing these.
He lives a long life, but is reincarnated again and again; he has not met with the Lord. ||6||
He may enjoy princely pleasures, and regal pomp and ceremony, and issue unchallenged commands.
He may lie on beautiful beds, perfumed with sandalwood oil, but this will led him only to the gates of the most horrible hell. ||7||
Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is the highest of all actions.
Says Nanak, he alone obtains it, who is pre-destined to receive it. ||8||
Your slave is intoxicated with this Love of Yours.
The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful to me, and this mind is imbued with the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||Second Pause||1||3||
Vaar Of Raag Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok, First Mehl:
Sorat'h is always beautiful, if it brings the True Lord to dwell in the mind of the soul-bride.
Her teeth are clean and her mind is not split by duality; the Name of the True Lord is on her tongue.
Here and hereafter, she abides in the Fear of God, and serves the True Guru without hesitation.
Discarding worldly adornments, she meets her Husband Lord, and she celebrates joyfully with Him.
She is adorned forever with the Name in her mind, and she does not have even an iota of filth.
Her husband's younger and elder brothers, the corrupt desires, have died, suffering in pain; and now, who fears Maya, the mother-in-law?
If she becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord, O Nanak, she bears the jewel of good karma upon her forehead, and everything is Truth to her. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
Sorat'h is beautiful only when it leads the soul-bride to seek the Lord's Name.
She pleases her Guru and God; under Guru's Instruction, she speaks the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
She is attracted to the Lord's Name, day and night, and her body is drenched in the color of the Love of the Lord, Har, Har.
No other being like the Lord God can be found; I have looked and searched over the whole world.
The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam within me; my mind does not waver any more.
Servant Nanak is the Lord's slave, the slave of the slaves of the Guru, the True Guru. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself are the Creator, the Fashioner of the world.
You Yourself have arranged the play, and You Yourself arrange it.
You Yourself are the Giver and the Creator; You Yourself are the Enjoyer.
The Word of Your Shabad is pervading everywhere, O Creator Lord.
As Gurmukh, I ever praise the Lord; I am a sacrifice to the Guru. ||1||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 049

Shalok, Third Mehl:
In the flames of egotism, he is burnt to death; he wanders in doubt and the love of duality.
The Perfect True Guru saves him, making him His own.
This world is burning; through the Sublime Word of the Guru's Shabad, this comes to be seen.
Those who are attuned to the Shabad are cooled and soothed; O Nanak, they practice Truth. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding; blessed and acceptable is such a life.
Those who do not forget the True Guru, in life and in death, are truly wise people.
Their families are saved, and they are approved by the Lord.
The Gurmukhs are approved in death as in life, while the self-willed manmukhs continue the cycle of birth and death.
O Nanak, they are not described as dead, who are absorbed in the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
Pauree:
Serve the Immaculate Lord God, and meditate on the Lord's Name.
Join the Society of the Holy Saints, and be absorbed in the Lord's Name.
O Lord, glorious and great is service to You; I am so foolish
\- please, commit me to it. I am Your servant and slave; command me, according to Your Will.
As Gurmukh, I shall serve You, as Guru has instructed me. ||2||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
He acts according to pre-ordained destiny, written by the Creator Himself.
Emotional attachment has drugged him, and he has forgotten the Lord, the treasure of virtue.
Don't think that he is alive in the world - he is dead, through the love of duality.
Those who do not meditate on the Lord, as Gurmukh, are not permitted to sit near the Lord.
They suffer the most horrible pain and suffering, and neither their sons nor their wives go along with them.
Their faces are blackened among men, and they sigh in deep regret.
No one places any reliance in the self-willed manmukhs; trust in them is lost.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs live in absolute peace; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within them. ||1||
Third Mehl:
They alone are relatives, and they alone are friends, who, as Gurmukh, join together in love.
Night and day, they act according to the True Guru's Will; they remain absorbed in the True Name.
Those who are attached to the love of duality are not called friends; they practice egotism and corruption.
The self-willed manmukhs are selfish; they cannot resolve anyone's affairs.
O Nanak, they act according to their pre-ordained destiny; no one can erase it. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself arranged the play of it.
You Yourself created the three qualities, and fostered emotional attachment to Maya.
He is called to account for his deeds done in egotism; he continues coming and going in reincarnation.
The Guru instructs those whom the Lord Himself blesses with Grace.
I am a sacrifice to my Guru; forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||3||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The love of Maya is enticing; without teeth, it has eaten up the world.
The self-willed manmukhs are eaten away, while the Gurmukhs are saved; they focus their consciousness on the True Name.
Without the Name, the world wanders around insane; the Gurmukhs come to see this.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 050

Involved in worldly affairs, he wastes his life in vain; the peace-giving Lord does not come to abide in his mind.
O Nanak, they alone obtain the Name, who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The home within is filled with Ambrosial Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh does not get to taste it.
He is like the deer, who does not recognize its own musk-scent; it wanders around, deluded by doubt.
The manmukh forsakes the Ambrosial Nectar, and instead gathers poison; the Creator Himself has fooled him.
How rare are the Gurmukhs, who obtain this understanding; they behold the Lord God within themselves.
Their minds and bodies are cooled and soothed, and their tongues enjoy the sublime taste of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Shabad, the Name wells up; through the Shabad, we are united in the Lord's Union.
Without the Shabad, the whole world is insane, and it loses its life in vain.
The Shabad alone is Ambrosial Nectar; O Nanak, the Gurmukhs obtain it. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord God is inaccessible; tell me, how can we find Him?
He has no form or feature, and He cannot be seen; tell me, how can we meditate on Him?
The Lord is formless, immaculate and inaccessible; which of His Virtues should we speak of and sing?
They alone walk on the Lord's Path, whom the Lord Himself instructs.
The Perfect Guru has revealed Him to me; serving the Guru, He is found. ||4||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
It is as if my body has been crushed in the oil-press, without yielding even a drop of blood;
it is as if my soul has been cut apart into pieces for the sake of the Love of the True Lord;
O Nanak, still, night and day, my Union with the Lord is not broken. ||1||
Third Mehl:
My Friend is so full of joy and love; He colors my mind with the color of His Love,
like the fabric which is treated to retain the color of the dye.
O Nanak, this color does not depart, and no other color can be imparted to this fabric. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord Himself is pervading everywhere; the Lord Himself causes us to chant His Name.
The Lord Himself created the creation; He commits all to their tasks.
He engages some in devotional worship, and others, He causes to stray.
He places some on the Path, while He leads others into the wilderness.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||5||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding, if one performs it with his mind focused on it.
The fruits of the mind's desires are obtained, and egotism departs from within.
His bonds are broken, and he is liberated; he remains absorbed in the True Lord.
It is so difficult to obtain the Naam in this world; it comes to dwell in the mind of the Gurmukh.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to one who serves his True Guru. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The mind of the self-willed manmukh is so very stubborn; it is stuck in the love of duality.
He does not find peace, even in dreams; he passes his life in misery and suffering.
The Pandits have grown weary of going door to door, reading and reciting their scriptures; the Siddhas have gone into their trances of Samaadhi.
This mind cannot be controlled; they are tired of performing religious rituals.
The impersonators have grown weary of wearing false costumes, and bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 051

They do not know the state of their own minds; they are deluded by doubt and egotism.
By Guru's Grace, the Fear of God is obtained; by great good fortune, the Lord comes to abide in the mind.
When the Fear of God comes, the mind is restrained, and through the Word of the Shabad, the ego is burnt away.
Those who are imbued with Truth are immaculate; their light merges in the Light.
Meeting the True Guru, one obtains the Name; O Nanak, he is absorbed in peace. ||2||
Pauree:
The pleasures of kings and emperors are pleasing, but they last for only a few days.
These pleasures of Maya are like the color of the safflower, which wears off in a moment.
They do not go with him when he departs; instead, he carries the load of sins upon his head.
When death seizes him, and marches him away, then he looks absolutely hideous.
That lost opportunity will not come into his hands again, and in the end, he regrets and repents. ||6||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru, suffer in sorrow and bondage.
Again and again, they are born only to die; they cannot meet their Lord.
The disease of doubt does not depart, and they find only pain and more pain.
O Nanak, if the Gracious Lord forgives, then one is united in Union with the Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru, shall find no place of rest or shelter.
They wander around from door to door, like a woman forsaken, with a bad character and a bad reputation.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are forgiven, and united in Union with the True Guru. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who serve the True Lord, the Destroyer of ego, cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
Those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are passed over by the Messenger of Death.
Those who meditate on the Lord, go to His Court in robes of honor.
They alone serve You, O Lord, whom You bless with Grace.
I sing continually Your Glorious Praises, O Beloved; as Gurmukh, my doubts and fears have been dispelled. ||7||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Upon the plate, three things have been placed; this is the sublime, ambrosial food of the Lord.
Eating this, the mind is satisfied, and the Door of Salvation is found.
It is so difficult to obtain this food, O Saints; it is obtained only by contemplating the Guru.
Why should we cast this riddle out of our minds? We should keep it ever enshrined in our hearts.
The True Guru has posed this riddle. The Guru's Sikhs have found its solution.
O Nanak, he alone understands this, whom the Lord inspires to understand. The Gurmukhs work hard, and find the Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Those whom the Primal Lord unites, remain in Union with Him; they focus their consciousness on the True Guru.
Those whom the Lord Himself separates, remain separated; in the love of duality, they are ruined.
O Nanak, without good karma, what can anyone obtain? He earns what he is pre-destined to receive. ||2||
Pauree:
Sitting together, the companions sing the Songs of the Lord's Praises.
They praise the Lord's Name continually; they are a sacrifice to the Lord.
Those who hear, and believe in the Lord's Name, to them I am a sacrifice.
O Lord, let me unite with the Gurmukhs, who are united with You.
I am a sacrifice to those who, day and night, behold their Guru. ||8||
Shalok, Third Mehl:

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 052

Without the Name of the Lord, everyone wanders around the world, losing.
The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in the pitch black darkness of egotism.
The Gurmukhs drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak, contemplating the Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Third Mehl:
He wakes in peace, and he sleeps in peace.
The Gurmukh praises the Lord night and day.
The self-willed manmukh remains deluded by his doubts.
He is filled with anxiety, and he cannot even sleep.
The spiritually wise wake and sleep in peace.
Nanak is a sacrifice to those who are imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
They alone meditate on the Lord's Name, who are imbued with the Lord.
They meditate on the One Lord; the One and Only Lord is True.
The One Lord is pervading everywhere; the One Lord created the Universe.
Those who meditate on the Lord's Name, cast out their fears.
The Lord Himself blesses them with Guru's Instruction; the Gurmukh meditates on the Lord. ||9||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Spiritual wisdom, which would bring understanding, does not enter into his mind.
Without seeing, how can he praise the Lord? The blind act in blindness.
O Nanak, when one realizes the Word of the Shabad, then the Naam comes to abide in the mind. ||1||
Third Mehl:
There is One Bani; there is One Guru; there is one Shabad to contemplate.
True is the merchandise, and true is the shop; the warehouses are overflowing with jewels.
By Guru's Grace, they are obtained, if the Great Giver gives them.
Dealing in this true merchandise, one earns the profit of the incomparable Naam.
In the midst of poison, the Ambrosial Nectar is revealed; by His Mercy, one drinks it in.
O Nanak, praise the True Lord; blessed is the Creator, the Embellisher. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who are permeated by falsehood, do not love the Truth.
If someone speaks the Truth, falsehood is burnt away.
The false are satisfied by falsehood, like the crows who eat manure.
When the Lord grants His Grace, then one meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
As Gurmukh, worship the Lord's Name in adoration; fraud and sin shall disappear. ||10||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Shaykh, you wander in the four directions, blown by the four winds; bring your mind back to the home of the One Lord.
Renounce your petty arguments, and realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Bow in humble respect before the True Guru; He is the Knower who knows everything.
Burn away your hopes and desires, and live like a guest in this world.
If you walk in harmony with the True Guru's Will, then you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord.
O Nanak, those who do not contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord - cursed are their clothes, and cursed is their food. ||1||
Third Mehl:
There is no end to the Lord's Glorious Praises; His worth cannot be described.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord; they are absorbed in His Glorious Virtues. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord has adorned the coat of the body; He has embroidered it with devotional worship.
The Lord has woven His silk into it, in so many ways and fashions.
How rare is that man of understanding, who understands, and deliberates within.
He alone understands these deliberations, whom the Lord Himself inspires to understand.
Poor servant Nanak speaks: the Gurmukhs know the Lord, the Lord is True. ||11||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 053

Shalok, Third Mehl:
Great men speak the teachings by relating them to individual situations, but the whole world shares in them.
One who becomes Gurmukh knows the Fear of God, and realizes his own self.
If, by Guru's Grace, one remains dead while yet alive, the mind becomes content in itself.
Those who have no faith in their own minds, O Nanak - how can they speak of spiritual wisdom? ||1||
Third Mehl:
Those who do not focus their consciousness on the Lord, as Gurmukh, suffer pain and grief in the end.
They are blind, inwardly and outwardly, and they do not understand anything.
O Pandit, O religious scholar, the whole world is fed for the sake of those who are attuned to the Lord's Name.
Those who praise the Word of the Guru's Shabad, remain blended with the Lord.
O Pandit, O religious scholar, no one is satisfied, and no one finds true wealth through the love of duality.
They have grown weary of reading scriptures, but still, they do not find contentment, and they pass their lives burning, night and day.
Their cries and complaints never end, and doubt does not depart from within them.
O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they rise up and depart with blackened faces. ||2||
Pauree:
O Beloved, lead me to meet my True Friend; meeting with Him, I shall ask Him to show me the Path.
I am a sacrifice to that Friend, who shows it to me.
I share His Virtues with Him, and meditate on the Lord's Name.
I serve my Beloved Lord forever; serving the Lord, I have found peace.
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has imparted this understanding to me. ||12||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Pandit, O religious scholar, your filth shall not be erased, even if you read the Vedas for four ages.
The three qualities are the roots of Maya; in egotism, one forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Pandits are deluded, attached to duality, and they deal only in Maya.
They are filled with thirst and hunger; the ignorant fools starve to death.
Serving the True Guru, peace is obtained, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.
Hunger and thirst have departed from within me; I am in love with the True Name.
O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam, who keep the Lord clasped tightly to their hearts, are automatically satisfied. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh does not serve the Lord's Name, and so he suffers in horrible pain.
He is filled with the darkness of ignorance, and he does not understand anything.
Because of his stubborn mind, he does not plant the seeds of intuitive peace; what will he eat in the world hereafter, to satisfy his hunger?
He has forgotten the treasure of the Naam; he is caught in the love of duality.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are honored with glory, when the Lord Himself unites them in His Union. ||2||
Pauree:
The tongue which sings the Lord's Praises, is so very beautiful.
One who speaks the Lord's Name, with mind, body and mouth, is pleasing to the Lord.
That Gurmukh tastes the the sublime taste of the Lord, and is satisfied.
She sings continually the Glorious Praises of her Beloved; singing His Glorious Praises, she is uplifted.
She is blessed with the Lord's Mercy, and she chants the Words of the Guru, the True Guru. ||13||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The elephant offers its head to the reins, and the anvil offers itself to the hammer;
just so, we offer our minds and bodies to our Guru; we stand before Him, and serve Him.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 054

This is how the Gurmukhs eliminate their self-conceit, and come to rule the whole world.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, when the Lord casts His Glance of Grace. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Blessed and approved is the coming into the world, of those Gurmukhs who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, they save their families, and they are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
The Guru unites His Sikhs, the Gurmukhs, with the Lord.
The Guru keeps some of them with Himself, and engages others in His Service.
Those who cherish their Beloved in their conscious minds, the Guru blesses them with His Love.
The Guru loves all of His Gursikhs equally well, like friends, children and siblings.
So chant the Name of the Guru, the True Guru, everyone! Chanting the Name of the Guru, Guru, you shall be rejuvenated. ||14||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Nanak, the blind, ignorant fools do not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they involve themselves in other activities.
They are bound and gagged at the door of the Messenger of Death; they are punished, and in the end, they rot away in manure. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O Nanak, those humble beings are true and approved, who serve their True Guru.
They remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord, and their comings and goings cease. ||2||
Pauree:
Gathering the wealth and property of Maya, brings only pain in the end.
Homes, mansions and adorned palaces will not go with anyone.
He may breed horses of various colors, but these will not be of any use to him.
O human, link your consciousness to the Lord's Name, and in the end, it shall be your companion and helper.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukh is blessed with peace. ||15||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Without the karma of good actions, the Name is not obtained; it can be obtained only by perfect good karma.
O Nanak, if the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then under Guru's Instruction, one is united in His Union. ||1||
First Mehl:
Some are cremated, and some are buried; some are eaten by dogs.
Some are thrown into water, while others are thrown into wells.
O Nanak, it is not known, where they go and into what they merge. ||2||
Pauree:
The food and clothes, and all the worldly possessions of those who are attuned to the Lord's Name are sacred.
All the homes, temples, palaces and way-stations are sacred, where the Gurmukhs, the selfless servants, the Sikhs and the renouncers of the world, go and take their rest.
All the horses, saddles and horse blankets are sacred, upon which the Gurmukhs, the Sikhs, the Holy and the Saints, mount and ride.
All the rituals and Dharmic practices and deeds are sacred, for those who utter the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the True Name of the Lord.
Those Gurmukhs, those Sikhs, who have purity as their treasure, go to their Guru. ||16||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Nanak, forsaking the Name, he loses everything, in this world and the next.
Chanting, deep meditation and austere self-disciplined practices are all wasted; he is deceived by the love of duality.
He is bound and gagged at the door of the Messenger of Death. He is beaten, and receives terrible punishment. ||1||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 055

Third Mehl:
They inflict their hatred upon the Saints, and they love the wicked sinners.
They find no peace in either this world or the next; they are born only to die, again and again.
Their hunger is never satisfied, and they are ruined by duality.
The faces of these slanderers are blackened in the Court of the True Lord.
O Nanak, without the Naam, they find no shelter on either this shore, or the one beyond. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who meditate on the Lord's Name, are imbued with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in their minds.
For those who worship the One Lord in their conscious minds, there is no other than the One Lord.
They alone serve the Lord, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny is written.
They continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and singing the Glories of the Glorious Lord, they are uplifted.
Great is the greatness of the Gurmukhs, who, through the Perfect Guru, remain absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||17||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
It is very difficult to serve the True Guru; offer your head, and eradicate self-conceit.
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad shall never have to die again; his service is totally approved.
Touching the philosopher's stone, one becomes the philosopher's stone, which transforms lead into gold; remain lovingly attached to the True Lord.
One who has such pre-ordained destiny, comes to meet the True Guru and God.
O Nanak, the Lord's servant does not meet Him because of his own account; he alone is acceptable, whom the Lord forgives. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The fools do not know the difference between good and bad; they are deceived by their self-interests.
But if they contemplate the Word of the Shabad, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and their light merges in the Light.
The Fear of God is always on their minds, and so they come to understand everything.
The True Guru is pervading the homes within; He Himself blends them with the Lord.
O Nanak, they meet the True Guru, and all their desires are fulfilled, if the Lord grants His Grace and so wills. ||2||
Pauree:
Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those devotees, who, with their mouths, utter the Name of the Lord.
Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those Saints, who, with their ears, listen to the Lord's Praises.
Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those holy people, who sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and so become virtuous.
Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those Gurmukhs, who live as Gursikhs, and conquer their minds.
But the greatest good fortune of all, is that of the Guru's Sikhs, who fall at the Guru's feet. ||18||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
One who knows God, and who lovingly focuses his attention on the One Word of the Shabad, keeps his spirituality intact.
The nine treasures and the eighteen spiritual powers of the Siddhas follow him, who keeps the Lord enshrined in his heart.
Without the True Guru, the Name is not found; understand this, and reflect upon it.
O Nanak, through perfect good destiny, one meets the True Guru, and finds peace, throughout the four ages. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Whether he is young or old, the self-willed manmukh cannot escape hunger and thirst.
The Gurmukhs are imbued with the Word of the Shabad; they are at peace, having lost their self-conceit.
They are satisfied and satiated within; they never feel hungry again.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 056

O Nanak, whatever the Gurmukhs do is acceptable; they remain lovingly absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
I am a sacrifice to those Sikhs who are Gurmukhs.
I behold the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of those who meditate on the Lord's Name.
Listening to the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, I contemplate His virtues; I write His Praises on the fabric of my mind.
I praise the Lord's Name with love, and eradicate all my sins.
Blessed, blessed and beauteous is that body and place, where my Guru places His feet. ||19||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Without the Guru, spiritual wisdom is not obtained, and peace does not come to abide in the mind.
O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the self-willed manmukhs depart, after having wasted their lives. ||1||
Third Mehl:
All the Siddhas, spiritual masters and seekers search for the Name; they have grown weary of concentrating and focusing their attention.
Without the True Guru, no one finds the Name; the Gurmukhs unite in Union with the Lord.
Without the Name, all food and clothes are worthless; cursed is such spirituality, and cursed are such miraculous powers.
That alone is spirituality, and that alone is miraculous power, which the Carefree Lord spontaneously bestows.
O Nanak, the Lord's Name abides in the mind of the Gurmukh; this is spirituality, and this is miraculous power. ||2||
Pauree:
I am a minstrel of God, my Lord and Master; every day, I sing the songs of the Lord's Glorious Praises.
I sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and I listen to the Praises of the Lord, the Master of wealth and Maya.
The Lord is the Great Giver; all the world is begging; all beings and creatures are beggars.
O Lord, You are kind and compassionate; You give Your gifts to even worms and insects among the rocks.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh, he has become truly wealthy. ||20||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Reading and studying are just worldly pursuits, if there is thirst and corruption within.
Reading in egotism, all have grown weary; through the love of duality, they are ruined.
He alone is educated, and he alone is a wise Pandit, who contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
He searches within himself, and finds the true essence; he finds the Door of Salvation.
He finds the Lord, the treasure of excellence, and peacefully contemplates Him.
Blessed is the trader, O Nanak, who, as Gurmukh, takes the Name as his only Support. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Without conquering his mind, no one can be successful. See this, and concentrate on it.
The wandering holy men are tired of of making pilgrimages to sacred shrines; they have not been able to conquer their minds.
The Gurmukh has conquered his mind, and he remains lovingly absorbed in the True Lord.
O Nanak, this is how the filth of the mind is removed; the Word of the Shabad burns away the ego. ||2||
Pauree:
O Saints of the Lord, O my Siblings of Destiny, please meet with me, and implant the Name of the One Lord within me.
O humble servants of the Lord, adorn me with the decorations of the Lord, Har, Har; let me wear the robes of the Lord's forgiveness.
Such decorations are pleasing to my God; such love is dear to the Lord.
I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, day and night; in an instant, all sins are eradicated.
That Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord becomes merciful, chants the Lord's Name, and wins the game of life. ||21||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 057

Shalok, Third Mehl:
The filth of countless incarnations sticks to this mind; it has become pitch black.
The oily rag cannot be cleaned by merely washing it, even if it is washed a hundred times.
By Guru's Grace, one remains dead while yet alive; his intellect is transformed, and he becomes detached from the world.
O Nanak, no filth sticks to him, and he does not fall into the womb again. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Kali Yuga is called the Dark Age, but the most sublime state is attained in this age.
The Gurmukh obtains the fruit, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises; this is his destiny, ordained by the Lord.
O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, he worships the Lord night and day; he chants the Lord's Name, and remains absorbed in the Lord's devotional worship. ||2||
Pauree:
O Lord, unite me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, so that with my mouth, I may speak the sublime Word of the Guru's Bani.
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and constantly chant the Lord's Name; through the Guru's Teachings, I enjoy the Lord's Love constantly.
I take the medicine of meditation on the Lord's Name, which has cured all diseases and multitudes of sufferings.
Those who do not forget the Lord, while breathing or eating - know them to be the perfect servants of the Lord.
Those Gurmukhs who worship the Lord in adoration end their subservience to the Messenger of Death, and to the world. ||22||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O man, you have been tormented by a nightmare, and you have passed your life in sleep.
You did not wake to hear the Word of the True Guru's Shabad; you have no inspiration within yourself.
That body burns, which has no virtue, and which does not serve the Guru.
I have seen that the world is burning, in egotism and the love of duality.
O Nanak, those who seek the Guru's Sanctuary are saved; within their minds, they meditate on the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, the soul-bride is rid of egotism, and she is glorified.
If she walks steadily in the way of His Will, then she is adorned with decorations.
Her couch becomes beautiful, and she constantly enjoys her Husband Lord; she obtains the Lord as her Husband.
The Lord does not die, and she never suffers pain; she is a happy soul-bride forever.
O Nanak, the Lord God unites her with Himself; she enshrines love and affection for the Guru. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who conceal and deny their Guru, are the most evil people.
O Dear Lord, let me not even see them; they are the worst sinners and murderers.
They wander from house to house, with impure minds, like wicked, forsaken women.
But by great good fortune, they may meet the Company of the Holy; as Gurmukhs, they are reformed.
O Lord, please be kind and let me meet the True Guru; I am a sacrifice to the Guru. ||23||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Serving the Guru, peace is produced, and then, one does not suffer in pain.
The cycle of birth and death is brought to an end, and death has no power over at all.
His mind is imbued with the Lord, and he remains merged in the True Lord.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who walk in the Way of the True Guru's Will. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Without the Word of the Shabad, purity is not obtained, even though the soul-bride may adorn herself with all sorts of decorations.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 058

She does not know the value of her Husband Lord; she is attached to the love of duality.
She is impure, and ill-mannered, O Nanak; among women, she is the most evil woman. ||2||
Pauree:
Be kind to me, Lord, that I might chant the Word of Your Bani.
May I meditate on the Lord's Name, chant the Lord's Name, and obtain the profit of the Lord's Name.
I am a sacrifice to those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, day and night.
May I behold with my eyes those who worship and adore my Beloved True Guru.
I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has united me with my Lord, my friend, my very best friend. ||24||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord loves His slaves; the Lord is the friend of His slaves.
The Lord is under the control of His slaves, like the musical instrument under the control of the musician.
The Lord's slaves meditate on the Lord; they love their Beloved.
Please, hear me, O God - let Your Grace rain over the whole world.
The praise of the Lord's slaves is the Glory of the Lord.
The Lord loves His Own Glory, and so His humble servant is celebrated and hailed.
That humble servant of the Lord meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Lord, and the Lord's humble servant, are one and the same.
Servant Nanak is the slave of the Lord; O Lord, O God, please, preserve his honor. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
Nanak loves the True Lord; without Him, he cannot even survive.
Meeting the True Guru, one finds the Perfect Lord, and the tongue enjoys the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
Night and day, morning and night, I sing to You, Lord.
All beings and creatures meditate on Your Name.
You are the Giver, the Great Giver; we eat whatever You give us.
In the congregation of the devotees, sins are eradicated.
Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, O Lord. ||25||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
He has spiritual ignorance within, and his intellect is dull and dim; he does not place his faith in the True Guru.
He has deceit within himself, and so he sees deception in all others; through his deceptions, he is totally ruined.
The True Guru's Will does not enter into his consciousness, and so he wanders around, pursuing his own interests.
If He grants His Grace, then Nanak is absorbed into the Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya; in the love of duality, their minds are unsteady.
Night and day, they are burning; day and night, they are totally ruined by their egotism.
Within them, is the total pitch darkness of greed, and no one even approaches them.
They themselves are miserable, and they never find peace; they are born, only to die, and die again.
O Nanak, the True Lord God forgives those, who focus their consciousness on the Guru's feet. ||2||
Pauree:
That Saint, that devotee, is acceptable, who is loved by God.
Those beings are wise, who meditate on the Lord.
They eat the food, the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.
They apply the dust of the feet of the Saints to their foreheads.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 059

O Nanak, they are purified, bathing in the sacred shrine of the Lord. ||26||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
Within the Gurmukh is peace and tranquility; his mind and body are absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
He contemplates the Naam, he studies the Naam, and he remains lovingly absorbed in the Naam.
He obtains the treasure of the Naam, and his anxiety is dispelled.
Meeting with the Guru, the Naam wells up, and his thirst and hunger are completely relieved.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, he gathers in the Naam. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
One who is cursed by the True Guru, abandons his home, and wanders around aimlessly.
He is jeered at, and his face is blackened in the world hereafter.
He babbles incoherently, and foaming at the mouth, he dies.
What can anyone do? Such is his destiny, according to his past deeds.
Wherever he goes, he is a liar, and by telling lies, he not liked by anyone.
O Siblings of Destiny, behold this, the glorious greatness of our Lord and Master, O Saints; as one behaves, so does he receive.
This shall be God's determination in His True Court; servant Nanak predicts and proclaims this. ||2||
Pauree:
The True Guru has established the village; the Guru has appointed its guards and protectors.
My hopes are fulfilled, and my mind is imbued with the love of the Guru's Feet.
The Guru is infinitely merciful; He has erased all my sins.
The Guru has showered me with His Mercy, and He has made me His own.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who has countless virtues. ||27||
Shalok, First Mehl:
By His Command, we receive our pre-ordained rewards; so what can we do now, O Pandit?
When His Command is received, then it is decided; all beings move and act accordingly. ||1||
Second Mehl:
The string through the nose is in the hands of the Lord Master; one's own actions drive him on.
Wherever his food is, there he eats it; O Nanak, this is the Truth. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord Himself puts everything in its proper place.
He Himself created the creation, and He Himself destroys it.
He Himself fashions His creatures, and He Himself nourishes them.
He hugs His slaves close in His embrace, and blesses them with His Glance of Grace.
O Nanak, His devotees are forever in bliss; they have burnt away the love of duality. ||28||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O mind, meditate on the Dear Lord, with single-minded conscious concentration.
The glorious greatness of the Lord shall last forever and ever; He never regrets what He gives.
I am forever a sacrifice to the Lord; serving Him, peace is obtained.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains merged with the Lord; he burns away his ego through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Third Mehl:
He Himself enjoins us to serve Him, and He Himself blesses us with forgiveness.
He Himself is the father and mother of all; He Himself cares for us.
O Nanak, those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abide in the home of their inner being; they are honored throughout the ages. ||2||
Pauree:
You are the Creator, all-powerful, able to do anything. Without You, there is no other at all.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 060

You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself shall destroy it in the end.
The Word of Your Shabad alone is pervading everywhere; whatever You do, comes to pass.
God blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness, and then, he finds the Lord.
As Gurmukh, Nanak worships and adores the Lord; let everyone proclaim, “Blessed, blessed, blessed is He, the Guru!”||29||1||SUDH||
Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Kabeer Jee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Worshipping their idols, the Hindus die; the Muslims die bowing their heads.
The Hindus cremate their dead, while the Muslims bury theirs; neither finds Your true state, Lord. ||1||
O mind, the world is a deep, dark pit.
On all four sides, Death has spread his net. ||1||Pause||
Reciting their poems, the poets die; the mystical ascetics die while journeying to Kaydaar Naat'h.
The Yogis die, with their matted hair, but even they do not find Your state, Lord. ||2||
The kings die, gathering and hoarding their money, burying great quantities of gold.
The Pandits die, reading and reciting the Vedas; women die, gazing at their own beauty. ||3||
Without the Lord's Name, all come to ruin; behold, and know this, O body.
Without the Name of the Lord, who can find salvation? Kabeer speaks the Teachings. ||4||1||
When the body is burnt, it turns to ashes; if it is not cremated, then it is eaten by armies of worms.
The unbaked clay pitcher dissolves, when water is poured into it; this is also the nature of the body. ||1||
Why, O Siblings of Destiny, do you strut around, all puffed up with pride?
Have you forgotten those days, when you were hanging, face down, for ten months? ||1||Pause||
Like the bee which collects honey, the fool eagerly gathers and collects wealth.
At the time of death, they shout, “Take him away, take him away! Why leave a ghost lying around?”||2||
His wife accompanies him to the threshold, and his friends and companions beyond.
All the people and relatives go as far as the cremation grounds, and then, the soul-swan goes on alone. ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O mortal being: you have been seized by Death, and you have fallen into the deep, dark pit.
You have entangled yourself in the false wealth of Maya, like the parrot caught in the trap. ||4||2||
Listening to all the teachings of the Vedas and the Puraanas, I wanted to perform the religious rituals.
But seeing all the wise men caught by Death, I arose and left the Pandits; now I am free of this desire. ||1||
O mind, you have not completed the only task you were given;
you have not meditated on the Lord, your King. ||1||Pause||
Going to the forests, they practice Yoga and deep, austere meditation; they live on roots and the fruits they gather.
The musicians, the Vedic scholars, the chanters of one word and the men of silence, all are listed on the Register of Death. ||2||
Loving devotional worship does not enter into your heart; pampering and adorning your body, you must still give it up.
You sit and play music, but you are still a hypocrite; what do you expect to receive from the Lord? ||3||
Death has fallen on the whole world; the doubting religious scholars are also listed on the Register of Death.

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 061

Says Kabeer, those humble people become pure - they become Khalsa - who know the Lord's loving devotional worship. ||4||3||
SECOND HOUSE||
With both of my eyes, I look around;
I don't see anything except the Lord.
My eyes gaze lovingly upon Him,
and now, I cannot speak of anything else. ||1||
My doubts were removed, and my fear ran away,
when my consciousness became attached to the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
When the magician beats his tambourine,
everyone comes to see the show.
When the magician winds up his show,
then he enjoys its play all alone. ||2||
By preaching sermons, one's doubt is not dispelled.
Everyone is tired of preaching and teaching.
The Lord causes the Gurmukh to understand;
his heart remains permeated with the Lord. ||3||
When the Guru grants even a bit of His Grace,
one's body, mind and entire being are absorbed into the Lord.
Says Kabeer, I am imbued with the Lord's Love;
I have met with the Life of the world, the Great Giver. ||4||4||
Let the sacred scriptures be your milk and cream,
and the ocean of the mind the churning vat.
Be the butter-churner of the Lord,
and your buttermilk shall not be wasted. ||1||
O soul-bride slave, why don't you take the Lord as your Husband?
He is the Life of the world, the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||
The chain is around your neck, and the cuffs are on your feet.
The Lord has sent you wandering around from house to house.
And still, you do not meditate on the Lord, O soul-bride, slave.
Death is watching you, O wretched woman. ||2||
The Lord God is the Cause of causes.
What is in the hands of the poor soul-bride, the slave?
She awakens from her slumber,
and she becomes attached to whatever the Lord attaches her. ||3||
O soul-bride, slave, where did you obtain that wisdom,
by which you erased your inscription of doubt?
Kabeer has tasted that subtle essence;
by Guru's Grace, his mind is reconciled with the Lord. ||4||5||
Without Him, we cannot even live;
when we meet Him, then our task is completed.
People say it is good to live forever,
but without dying, there is no life. ||1||
So now, what sort wisdom should I contemplate and preach?
As I watch, worldly things dissipate. ||1||Pause||
Saffron is ground up, and mixed with sandalwood;
without eyes, the world is seen.
The son has given birth to his father;
without a place, the city has been established. ||2||
The humble beggar has found the Great Giver,
but he is unable to eat what he has been given.
He cannot leave it alone, but it is never exhausted.
He shall not go to beg from others any longer. ||3||
Those select few, who know how to die while yet alive, enjoy great peace.
Kabeer has found that wealth;
meeting with the Lord, he has erased his self-conceit. ||4||6||
What use is it to read, and what use is it to study?
What use is it to listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas?
What use is reading and listening,
if celestial peace is not attained? ||1||
The fool does not chant the Name of the Lord.
So what does he think of, over and over again? ||1||Pause||
In the darkness, we need a lamp

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 062

to find the incomprehensible thing.
I have found this incomprehensible thing;
my mind is illuminated and enlightened. ||2||
Says Kabeer, now I know Him;
since I know Him, my mind is pleased and appeased.
My mind is pleased and appeased, and yet, people do not believe it.
They do not believe it, so what can I do? ||3||7||
In his heart there is deception, and yet in his mouth are words of wisdom.
You are false - why are you churning water? ||1||
Why do you bother to wash your body?
Your heart is still full of filth. ||1||Pause||
The gourd may be washed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines,
but even then, its bitterness is not removed. ||2||
Says Kabeer after deep contemplation,
please help me cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Lord, O Destroyer of ego. ||3||8||
Sorat'h:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Practicing great hypocrisy, he acquires the wealth of others.
Returning home, he squanders it on his wife and children. ||1||
O my mind, do not practice deception, even inadvertently.
In the end, your own soul shall have to answer for its account. ||1||Pause||
Moment by moment, the body is wearing away, and old age is asserting itself.
And then, when you are old, no one shall pour water into your cup. ||2||
Says Kabeer, no one belongs to you.
Why not chant the Lord's Name in your heart, when you are still young? ||3||9||
O Saints, my windy mind has now become peaceful and still.
It seems that I have learned something of the science of Yoga. ||Pause||
The Guru has shown me the hole,
through which the deer carefully enters.
I have now closed off the doors,
and the unstruck celestial sound current resounds. ||1||
The pitcher of my heart-lotus is filled with water;
I have spilled out the water, and set it upright.
Says Kabeer, the Lord's humble servant, this I know.
Now that I know this, my mind is pleased and appeased. ||2||10||
Raag Sorat'h:
I am so hungry, I cannot perform devotional worship service.
Here, Lord, take back Your mala.
I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saints.
I do not owe anyone anything. ||1||
O Lord, how can I be with You?
If You do not give me Yourself, then I shall beg until I get You. ||Pause||
I ask for two kilos of flour,
and half a pound of ghee, and salt.
I ask for a pound of beans,
which I shall eat twice a day. ||2||
I ask for a cot, with four legs,
and a pillow and mattress.
I ask for a quit to cover myself.
Your humble servant shall perform Your devotional worship service with love. ||3||
I have no greed;
Your Name is the only ornament I wish for.
Says Kabeer, my mind is pleased and appeased;
now that my mind is pleased and appeased, I have come to know the Lord. ||4||11||
Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When I see Him, I sing His Praises.
Then I, his humble servant, become patient. ||1||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 063

Meeting the Divine True Guru, I merge into the sound current of the Naad. ||1||Pause||
Where the dazzling white light is seen,
there the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds.
One's light merges in the Light;
by Guru's Grace, I know this. ||2||
The jewels are in the treasure chamber of the heart-lotus.
They sparkle and glitter like lightning.
The Lord is near at hand, not far away.
He is totally permeating and pervading in my soul. ||3||
Where the light of the undying sun shines,
the light of burning lamps seems insignificant.
By Guru's Grace, I know this.
Servant Naam Dayv is absorbed in the Celestial Lord. ||4||1||
FOURTH HOUSE, SORAT'H:
The woman next door asked Naam Dayv, "Who built your house?
I shall pay him double wages. Tell me, who is your carpenter?"||1||
O sister, I cannot give this carpenter to you.
Behold, my carpenter is pervading everywhere.
My carpenter is the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||
This carpenter demands the wages of love, if someone wants Him to build their house.
When one breaks his ties with all the people and relatives, then the carpenter comes of His own accord. ||2||
I cannot describe such a carpenter, who is contained in everything, everywhere.
The mute tastes the most sublime ambrosial nectar, but if you ask him to describe it, he cannot. ||3||
Listen to the virtues of this carpenter, O sister; He stopped the oceans, and established Dhroo as the pole star.
Naam Dayv's Lord Master brought Sita back, and gave Sri Lanka to Bhabheekhan. ||4||2||
SORAT'H, THIRD HOUSE:
The skinless drum plays.
Without the rainy season, the clouds shake with thunder.
Without clouds, the rain falls,
if one contemplates the essence of reality. ||1||
I have met my Beloved Lord.
Meeting with Him, my body is made beauteous and sublime. ||1||Pause||
Touching the philosopher's stone, I have been transformed into gold.
I have threaded the jewels into my mouth and mind.
I love Him as my own, and my doubt has been dispelled.
Seeking the Guru's guidance, my mind is content. ||2||
The water is contained within the pitcher;
I know that the One Lord is contained in all.
The mind of the disciple has faith in the Guru.
Servant Naam Dayv understands the essence of reality. ||3||3||
Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When I am in my ego, then You are not with me. Now that You are with me, there is no egotism within me.
The wind may raise up huge waves in the vast ocean, but they are just water in water. ||1||
O Lord, what can I say about such an illusion?
Things are not as they seem. ||1||Pause||
It is like the king, who falls asleep upon his throne, and dreams that he is a beggar.
His kingdom is intact, but separated from it, he suffers in sorrow. Such is my own condition. ||2||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 064

Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me.
Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold; now, I do not say what I said then. ||3||
The One Lord is pervading the many forms; He enjoys Himself in all hearts.
Says Ravi Daas, the Lord is nearer than our own hands and feet. Whatever will be, will be. ||4||1||
If I am bound by the noose of emotional attachment, then I shall bind You, Lord, with the bonds of love.
Go ahead and try to escape, Lord; I have escaped by worshipping and adoring You. ||1||
O Lord, You know my love for You.
Now, what will You do? ||1||Pause||
A fish is caught, cut up, and cooked it in many different ways.
Bit by bit, it is eaten, but still, it does not forget the water. ||2||
The Lord, our King, is father to no one, except those who love Him.
The veil of emotional attachment has been cast over the entire world, but it does not bother the Lord's devotee. ||3||
Says Ravi Daas, my devotion to the One Lord is increasing; now, who can I tell this to?
That which brought me to worship and adore You - I am still suffering that pain. ||4||2||
I obtained this precious human life as a reward for my past actions, but without discriminating wisdom, it is wasted in vain.
Tell me, without devotional worship of the Lord, of what use are mansions and thrones like those of King Indra? ||1||
You have not considered the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, our King;
this sublime essence shall cause you to forget all other essences. ||1||Pause||
We do not know what we need to know, and we have become insane. We do not consider what we should consider; our days are passing away.
Our passions are strong, and our discriminating intellect is weak; we have no access to the supreme objective. ||2||
We say one thing, and do something else; entangled in endless Maya, we do not understand anything.
Says Ravi Daas, Your slave, O Lord, I am disillusioned and detached; please, spare me Your anger, and have mercy on my soul. ||3||3||
He is the ocean of peace; the miraculous tree of life, the wish-fulfilling jewel, and the Kaamadhayna, the cow which fulfills all desires, all are in His power.
The four great blessings, the eighteen supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, and the nine treasures, are all in the palm of His hand. ||1||
You do not chant with your tongue the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
Abandon your involvement in all other words. ||1||Pause||
The various Shaastras, Puranaas, and the Vedas of Brahma, are made up of thirty-four letters.
After deep contemplation, Vyaas spoke of the supreme objective; there is nothing equal to the Lord's Name. ||2||
Very fortunate are those who are absorbed in celestial bliss, and released from their entanglements; they are lovingly attached to the Lord.
Says Ravi Daas, enshrine the Lord's Light within your heart, and your fear of birth and death shall run away from you. ||3||4||
If You are the mountain, Lord, then I am the peacock.
If You are the moon, then I am the partridge in love with it. ||1||
O Lord, if You will not break with me, then I will not break with You.
For, if I were to break with You, with whom would I then join? ||1||Pause||
If You are the lamp, then I am the wick.
If You are the sacred place of pilgrimage, then I am the pilgrim. ||2||

## Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 065

I am joined in true love with You, Lord.
I am joined with You, and I have broken with all others. ||3||
Wherever I go, there I serve You.
There is no other Lord Master than You, O Divine Lord. ||4||
Meditating, vibrating upon You, the noose of death is cut away.
To attain devotional worship, Ravi Daas sings to You, Lord. ||5||5||
The body is a wall of water, supported by the pillars of air; the egg and sperm are the mortar.
The framework is made up of bones, flesh and veins; the poor soul-bird dwells within it. ||1||
O mortal, what is mine, and what is yours?
The soul is like a bird perched upon a tree. ||1||Pause||
You lay the foundation and build the walls.
But in the end, three and a half cubits will be your measured space. ||2||
You make your hair beautiful, and wear a stylish turban on your head.
But in the end, this body shall be reduced to a pile of ashes. ||3||
Your palaces are lofty, and your brides are beautiful.
But without the Lord's Name, you shall lose the game entirely. ||4||
My social status is low, my ancestry is low, and my life is wretched.
I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Luminous Lord, my King; so says Ravi Daas, the shoemaker. ||5||6||
I am a shoemaker, but I do not know how to mend shoes.
People come to me to mend their shoes. ||1||Pause||
I have no awl to stitch them;
I have no knife to patch them. ||1||
Mending, mending, people waste their lives and ruin themselves.
Without wasting my time mending, I have found the Lord. ||2||
Ravi Daas chants the Lord's Name;
he is not concerned with the Messenger of Death. ||3||7||
Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Bheekhan Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Tears well up in my eyes, my body has become weak, and my hair has become milky-white.
My throat is tight, and I cannot utter even one word; what can I do now? I am a mere mortal. ||1||
O Lord, my King, Gardener of the world-garden, be my Physician,
and save me, Your Saint. ||1||Pause||
My head aches, my body is burning, and my heart is filled with anguish.
Such is the disease that has struck me; there is no medicine to cure it. ||2||
The Name of the Lord, the ambrosial, immaculate water, is the best medicine in the world.
By Guru's Grace, says servant Bheekhan, I have found the Door of Salvation. ||3||1||
Such is the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the invaluable jewel, the most sublime wealth, which I have found through good deeds.
By various efforts, I have enshrined it within my heart; this jewel cannot be hidden by hiding it. ||1||
The Glorious Praises of the Lord cannot be spoken by speaking.
They are like the sweet candies given to a mute. ||1||Pause||
The tongue speaks, the ears listen, and the mind contemplates the Lord; they find peace and comfort.
Says Bheekhan, my eyes are content; wherever I look, there I see the Lord. ||2||2||
