ASA KI WAR[^1]

THERE is but one God whose name is true, the Creator, devoid of fear and enmity, immortal, unborn, self-existent, great and beneficent.

GURU HAR GOBIND

This _War_ includes _sloks_. The _sloks_ also were written by the first Guru, and should be sung to the air of ‘Tunda As Raja’.[^2]

## SLOK

_Guru Nanak_

I am a sacrifice to my Guru a hundred times a day,
Who without any delay made demigods out of men.

_Guru Angad_

Were a hundred moons to rise, and a thousand suns to mount _the sky_;
Even with such light there would be appalling darkness without the Guru.

_Guru Nanak_

Nanak, they who very clever in their own estimation think not of the Guru,
Shall be left like spurious sesames in a reaped field.

<span id="p219">[<sup><small>p. 219</small></sup>]</span>

They shall be left in the field, saith Nanak, without an owner:
The wretches may even bear fruit and flower, but they shall be as ashes within their bodies.

## PAURI I[^1]

God Himself created the world and Himself gave names to _things_.
He made Maya[^2] by His power: seated He beheld _His work_ with delight.
O Creator, Thou art the Giver; being pleased Thou bestowest and practisest kindness.
Thou knowest all things; Thou givest and takest life with a word.[^3]
Seated Thou didst behold _Thy work_ with delight.

## SLOK II

_Guru Nanak_

True are Thy regions and true Thy universes,
True Thy worlds and true Thy creation
True Thine acts and all Thy thoughts;
True Thine order and true Thy court;
True Thy command and true Thy behest
True Thy favour and true Thy signs.
Hundreds of thousands and millions declare Thee true
True is all Thy power, true all Thy strength
True Thy praises, true _Thy_ eulogies
True Thy might, O true King.
Nanak, true are they who meditate on the True One.
They who are born and die are the falsest of the false.[^4]

[^1]: The _pauris_ in this collection are all by Guru Nanak, so in the original his name is omitted at their head.

[^2]: In Sanskrit literature, Mâya is styled _anâdi_, without a beginning, hence uncreated, but this is not the doctrine of the Gurus. To believe that God did not create Mâya would be to believe in a limitation of His power.

[^3]: Also translated—Thou givest and takest life from the body.

[^4]: _Koch_ is here used as the correlative of _sach_, true.

<span id="p220">[<sup><small>p. 220</small></sup>]</span>

_Guru Nanak_[^1]

Great is His glory whose name is great;
Great is His glory whose justice is true;
Great is His glory whose seat is immovable;
Great is His glory who understandeth _our_ utterances;
Great is His greatness who knoweth all our feelings;
Great is His glory who giveth without consulting _others_;
Great is His glory who is all in all Himself.
Nanak, His acts cannot be described.
All that He did and hath to do dependeth on His own will.

_Guru Angad_

This world is the True One's chamber; the True One's dwelling is therein.
Some by His order He absorbeth in _Himself_; others by His order He destroyeth.[^2]
Some at His pleasure He withdraweth from mammon; others _He causeth_ to abide therein.
It cannot be even told whom He will regenerate.
Nanak, he to whom God revealeth Himself, is known as holy.

## PAURI II

Nanak, _God_ having created animals recorded their names, and appointed Dharmraj _to judge their acts_.
At His own court the real truth is adjudged; He separateth and removeth those who are attached to mammon.
There the false find no place: they go to hell with blackened faces.
They who are imbued with Thy name win; the deceivers lose.
_God_ recorded names and appointed Dharmraj to record acts.

<span id="p221">[<sup><small>p. 221</small></sup>]</span>

## SLOK III

_Guru Nanak_

Wonderful Thy word, wonderful Thy knowledge;
Wonderful Thy creatures, wonderful their species;
Wonderful their forms, wonderful their colours
Wonderful the animals which wander naked;
Wonderful Thy wind; wonderful Thy water;
Wonderful Thy fire which sporteth wondrously;
Wonderful the earth, wonderful the sources of production
Wonderful the pleasures to which mortals are attached
Wonderful is meeting, wonderful parting _from Thee_;
Wonderful is hunger, wonderful repletion;
Wonderful Thy praises, wonderful Thy eulogies;
Wonderful the desert, wonderful the road;
Wonderful Thy nearness, wonderful Thy remoteness
Wonderful to behold Thee present.
Beholding these wonderful things I remain wondering.
Nanak, they who understand them are supremely fortunate.

_Guru Nanak_

By Thy power we see, by Thy power we hear, by Thy power we fear, _or enjoy_ the highest happiness;
By Thy power _were made_ the nether regions and the heavens; by Thy power all creation;
By Thy power _were produced_ the Veds, the Purans, the _Muhammadan_ books, and by Thy power all compositions;
By Thy power we eat, drink, and clothe ourselves; by Thy power _springeth_ all affection;
By Thy power are the species, genera, and colours of _creatures_; by Thy power are the animals of the world.[^1]
By Thy power are virtues; by Thy power are vices: by Thy power, honour and dishonour;[^2]

<span id="p222">[<sup><small>p. 222</small></sup>]</span>

By Thy power are wind, water, and fire; by Thy power is the earth.
Everything existeth by Thy power; Thou art the omnipotent Creator; Thy name is the holiest of the holy.
_Saith_ Nanak, Thou beholdest and pervadest _all things_ subject to Thy command: Thou art altogether unrivalled.

## PAURI III

_Man_ having enjoyed himself becometh ashes, and the soul passeth away.
However great and wealthy a man may be, _the ministers of Death_ throw a chain on his neck and take him away.
There an account of his acts is read; _the Judge_ on his seat taketh the account and passeth sentence.
Such a man shall find no place of _shelter_; when he is beaten, who will hear his cries?
Man, blind that thou art, thou hast wasted thy life.

## SLOK IV

_Guru Nanak_

In fear[^1] the winds and breezes ever blow
In fear flow hundreds of thousands of rivers
In fear fire performeth its forced labour;
In fear the earth is pressed by its burden
In fear Indar moveth headlong: in fear _sitteth_ Dharmraj at _God's_ gate;
In fear is the sun, in fear the moon; they travel millions of miles without end;
in fear are the Sidhs, the Budhas, the demigods, and the Naths; in fear are the stars[^2] and the firmament;
In fear are wrestlers, very mighty men and divine heroes;
In fear cargoes of men come and go.
God hath destined fear for every one;[^3] Nanak, the Formless One, the True, is alone without fear.

<span id="p223">[<sup><small>p. 223</small></sup>]</span>

_Guru Nanak_

Nanak, the Formless One is without fear; all the Rams were dust.
How many stories there are of Krishan! how many Veds and _religious_ compositions![^1]
How many beggars dance, and fall, and again beat time!
Actors enter the market-place and draw forth their appliances;[^2]
Kings and queens sing and utter nonsense;[^3]
They wear earrings worth hundreds of thousands, and necklaces worth hundreds of thousands.[^4]
The body on which they are worn, O Nanak, shall become ashes.
Divine knowledge is not sought in _mere_ words; to speak _concerning it_ were as hard as iron;
By God's grace man obtaineth it; skill and orders are useless _therefor_.

## PAURI IV

If the Kind One look with kindness, then is the true Guru obtained.
The soul hath wandered through many births, and now the true Guru hath communicated the Word.
There is no benefactor so great as the true Guru; hear this, all ye people.
By meeting the true Guru who hath removed pride from his heart, and who preacheth the Truest of the true,
The True One is obtained.

## SLOK V

Let all the gharis be your milkmaids, and the pahars your Krishans and Gopals[^5]:
Let wind, water, and fire be your jewels; and the moon and sun your avatars;

[^1]: Also translated—How many expound the Veds!

[^2]: Also translated—draw a crowd around them. This hymn purports to give a brief description of the miracle-plays of Ram and Krishan.

[^3]: Literally—speak of the upper and lower regions.

[^4]: _Lâkh takiân_. _Takâ_ is really a double pice, or about a halfpenny of English money, but in the plural it means money in general.

[^5]: _Gopâls_ are herdsmen among whom Krishan used to sport.

<span id="p224">[<sup><small>p. 224</small></sup>]</span>

The whole earth your _stage_ properties and vessels, which are all entanglements.
Nanak, they who are devoid of divine knowledge are robbed; the minister of death hath devoured them.

_Guru Nanak_

The disciples play, the gurus dance,
Shake their feet, and roll their heads.
Dust flieth and falleth on their hair;[^1]
The audience beholding laugh and go home.
For the sake of food _the performers_ beat time,
And dash themselves on the ground.
The milkmaids sing, Krishans sing,
Sitas and royal Rams sing.
Fearless is the Formless One, whose name is true,
And whose creation is the whole world.
The worshippers on whom God bestoweth kindness worship Him;
Pleasant[^2] is the night for those who long for Him in their hearts.
By the Guru's instruction to his disciples this knowledge _is obtained_,
That the Kind One saveth _those on whom He looketh_ with favour.
Oil-presses, spinning-wheels, hand-mills, potters' wheels,
Plates, whirlwinds, many and endless,
Tops, churning-staves, threshing-frames turn round
Birds tumble and take no breath.
Men put animals on stakes and whirl them.
O Nanak, the tumblers are innumerable and endless.
_In the same way_ those bound in entanglements are swung round;
Every one danceth according to his own acts—
They who dance and laugh shall weep on their departure;

<span id="p225">[<sup><small>p. 225</small></sup>]</span>

They cannot fly or obtain supernatural power.
Leaping and dancing are human recreations,
Nanak, they who have the fear of God in their hearts have also love.

## PAURI V

Thy name is the Formless: by repeating it man goeth not to hell.
The soul and body are all Thine: what Thou givest man eateth: to say _aught else were_ waste of words.
_O man_, if thou desire thine advantage, do good acts and be lowly.
Even though thou stave off old age, it shall come to thee in the disguise of death.
None may remain when his measure is full.

## SLOK VI

The Musalmans praise the Shariat, read it, and reflect on it;
_But_ God's servants are they who employ themselves in His service in order to behold Him.
The Hindus praise the Praised One whose appearance and form are incomparable;
They bathe in holy streams, _perform_ idol-worship and adoration, use[^1] copious incense of sandal.
The Jogis meditate on God the Creator, whom they call the Unseen,
Whose form is minute, whose name is the Bright One, and who is the image of their bodies.[^2]
In the minds of the generous contentment is produced in their desire to give.
Others give, but ask a thousandfold more, and still meant the world to honour them.
_Why mention_ thieves, adulterers, perjurers, evil and sinful men?

<span id="p226">[<sup><small>p. 226</small></sup>]</span>

Many depart from here after eating what they had amassed _in previous births_;[^1] shall they have any business whatever _in the next world_?[^2]
The _animals_ which live in the water, dry land, the fourteen worlds, and all creation—
What they say Thou alone knowest; for them too Thou carest.
_Saith_ Nanak, the saints hunger to praise Thee; the true Name i_s their_ support.
In everlasting joy they abide day and night: _may I obtain_ the dust of the feet of such virtuous _men_!

Guru Nanak and Shaikh Brahm discussed the question of the disposal of the dead. The Shaik maintained that a man who was burned would either go to hell or not rise at the day of judgement.

_Guru Nanak_

The ashes of the Musalman fall into the potter's clod;
Vessels and bricks are fashioned from them; they cry out as they burn.
The poor ashes burn and weep, and sparks fly from them.
Nanak, the Creator who made the world, knoweth _whether it is better to be burned or buried_.

## PAURI VI

Without the true Guru none hath found _God_: without the true Guru none hath found _God_.
God hath put Himself into the true Guru; He hath made manifest and proclaimed this.
Salvation is ever obtained by meeting the true Guru who hath banished worldly love from within him.
Best are the meditations of him who hath fixed his mind on the True One:
He hath found the Giver of life to the world.

[^1]: And have done nothing meritorious in this birth.

[^2]: This verse is also translated—Many depart from here after spending what they possessed; had they any other business _in this world_?

<span id="p227">[<sup><small>p. 227</small></sup>]</span>

## SLOK VII

In pride man cometh, in pride he departeth;
In pride is man born, in pride he dieth
In pride he giveth, in pride he taketh;
In pride he earneth, in pride he spendeth;
In pride man becometh true _or_ false;
In pride man meditateth evil _or_ good;
In pride he goeth to hell or heaven;
In pride he rejoiceth, in pride he mourneth;
In pride he becometh filthy, in pride he is cleansed;
In pride man loseth his caste and race;
In pride are the ignorant, in pride the clever;
_In pride_ one knoweth not the value of deliverance or salvation;
In pride is mammon and in pride its effect _on the heart_;
In pride are animals created.
When pride is removed, _God's_ gate is seen.
Without divine knowledge man worrieth himself by talking.
Nanak, the Commander hath thus ordained it
As man regardeth _God_, so _God_ regardeth him.[^1]

_Guru Angad_

It is the nature of pride that it produceth pride.
This pride is a trammel which subjecteth _man_ to repeated transmigration.
What is the origin of pride, and by what device shall it depart?
For pride it is ordained that, man wander according to his previous acts.
Pride is a chronic disease, but there is also a medicine for it in the heart.
If God bestow His grace, man shall avail himself of the Guru's instruction;
Saith Nanak, hear, O ye men, in this way trouble shall depart.



<span id="p228">[<sup><small>p. 228</small></sup>]</span>

## PAURI VII

They who have meditated on God as the truest of the true, have done _real_ worship and are contented;
They have refrained from evil,[^1] done good deeds, and practised honesty;
They have lived on a little corn and water, and burst the entanglements of the world.
Thou art the great Bestower; ever Thou givest _gifts_ which increase a quarterfold.
They who have magnified the great God have found Him.

## SLOK VIII

Men, trees, the banks of sacred streams, clouds, fields,
Islands, peoples, countries, continents, the universe,
The sources of _production_ from eggs, wombs, the earth, and perspiration,
Lakes, mountains, animals—O Nanak, God knoweth their condition.
Nanak, God having created animals taketh care of them all.
The Creator who created the world hath to take thought for it also.
It is the same Creator who made the world who taketh thought for it.
To Him be obeisance; blessings be on Him! His court is imperishable.
Nanak, without the true Name what is a sacrificial mark? what a sacrificial thread?

_Guru Nanak_

Man may perform hundreds of thousands of good acts and deeds, hundreds of thousands of approved charities,
Hundreds of thousands of penances at sacred places, sahaj jog[^2] in the wilderness,

<span id="p229">[<sup><small>p. 229</small></sup>]</span>

Hundreds of thousands of braveries, and part with his life in the conflict of battle;
He may study hundreds of thousands of Veds and works of divine knowledge and meditation, and read the Purans—
Nanak, these devices would be of no avail; true is the mark of grace.
The Creator who made the world hath decreed transmigration.

## PAURI VIII

Thou alone art the true Lord who hath diffused the real truth.
He to whom Thou givest obtaineth truth, and he then practiseth it.
Man obtaineth truth on meeting the true Guru in whose heart the truth dwelleth.
The fool knoweth not truth, and hath wasted his life by obstinacy;
Why hath he come into the world?

## SLOK IX

_Guru Nanak_

A man may load carts with books; he may load men with books _to take_ with him;
Books may be put on boats; pits may be filled with them.
A man may read books for months; he may read them for years;
He may read them for life; he may read them while he hath breath-
Nanak, only one word, _God's name_, would be of account; all else _would_ be the senseless discussion of pride.

_Guru Nanak_

The more one readeth and writeth, the more is one tormented;
The more one wandereth on pilgrimages, the more one babbleth;
The more religious garbs man weareth, the more discomfort he causeth his body.

<span id="p230">[<sup><small>p. 230</small></sup>]</span>

Bear, O my soul, the _result_ of thine own acts.
He who eateth not corn[^1] hath lost the relish _of life_.
Men suffer much pain through their attachment to mammon.
They who wear not clothes suffer terribly day and night.
Man ruineth himself by _perpetual_ silence; how can he who sleepeth in ignorance be awakened without a guru.
Even though man go barefooted, he must still suffer for his own acts.[^2]
If a man eat filth, and put ashes on his head,
The blind fool loseth respect; without the Name he obtaineth no _abiding_ place.
The ignorant man who dwelleth in the wilderness and at burial and cremation-grounds, knoweth not _God_ and shall afterwards regret.
He who meeteth the true Guru and fixeth _God's_ name in his heart, obtaineth comfort.
Nanak, he on whom _God_ looketh with favour obtaineth Him.
He becometh free from hopes and fears, and destroyeth his pride by means of the Word.

## PAURI IX

The saints, _O Lord_, please Thy heart, adorn Thy gate, and hymn Thy praises.
Nanak, they who are outside Thy favour, find no entrance and wander _in many births_.
Some know not their origin, and have an excessive opinion of themselves.
I am a singer of low caste; others call themselves of high caste.
I _only_ beg of those who meditate on Thee.[^3]



<span id="p231">[<sup><small>p. 231</small></sup>]</span>

## SLOK X

_Guru Nanak_

False are kings, false their subjects, false the whole world
False are mansions, false palaces, false those who dwell therein;
False is gold; false silver; false he who weareth them
False the body; false raiment; false peerless beauty;
False husbands; false wives; they waste away and become dust.
Man who is false loveth what is false, and forgetteth the Creator.
With whom contract friendship? The whole world passeth away.
False is sweetness; false honey; in falsehood shiploads are drowned.
Nanak humbly asserteth—except Thee, O God, everything is thoroughly false.

_Guru Nanak_

Man is known as true when truth is in his heart
When the filth of falsehood departeth, man washeth his body clean.
Man is known as true when he beareth love to the True One;
When the mind is enraptured on hearing the Name, man attaineth the door of salvation.
Man shall be known as true when he knoweth the _true_ way;
Having prepared the field of the body, put into it the seed of the Creator.
Man shall be known as true when he receiveth true instruction;
Let man show mercy to living things and perform some works of charity.
Man shall be known as true, when he dwelleth in the pilgrimage of his heart:

<span id="p232">[<sup><small>p. 232</small></sup>]</span>

Let man after inquiry from the true Guru rest and abide _in his own heart_;
Truth is the medicine for all; it removeth and washeth away sin.
Nanak maketh supplication to those who are in possession of truth.

## PAURI X

Be mine the gift of the dust of the saints' feet: if I obtain it, I shall apply it to my forehead.
Forsake false covetousness; concentrate thy mind and meditate on the Unseen One.
Thou shalt obtain a reward in proportion to what thou hast done.
If it have been so allotted from the beginning, man shall obtain the dust of the saints' feet.
Ruin not thyself with scant service.

## SLOK XI

_Guru Nanak_

There is a dearth of truth; falsehood prevaileth; the blackness of this age _maketh men_ demons.
They who have sown the seed of _the Name_ have departed with honour; how can half-seed germinate?
If the seed be whole, it will germinate in the proper season.
Nanak, unbleached cloth cannot be dyed without a base.
If the body be put into the vat of fear, modesty be made its base,
And it be dyed with devotion, O Nanak, there will not be a trace of falsehood in it.

_Guru Nanak_

Greed and sin are ruler and village accountant; falsehood is master of the mint.
Lust, his minister, summoneth and examineth men, and sitteth in judgement on them.
The subjects _are_ blind and without divine knowledge, and satisfy _the judge's_ greed with bribes.

<span id="p233">[<sup><small>p. 233</small></sup>]</span>

Priests dance, play musical instruments, disguise, and decorate themselves;
They shout aloud, sing of battles, and heroes' praises.
Fools call _themselves_ pandits and with tricks and cavilling love to amass _wealth_.
_Pretended_ religious men spoil their religious acts, _and yet_ want the door of salvation;
They call themselves continent, and leave their houses and homes, _yet_ they know not the way.
Every one is perfect to himself: no one admitteth himself wanting.
If the weight of honour be put into the scale, then, Nanak, man shall appear _properly_ weighed.

_Guru Nanak_

Man's evil becometh known, O Nanak; the True One seeth _all_.
Every one maketh endeavours, _but_ it is _only_ what the Creator doeth that taketh place.
Caste hath no power in the next world: there is a new _order of_ beings.
They whose accounts are honoured are the good.

## PAURI XI

They whom Thou didst so destine from the beginning meditate on _Thee_, O Lord.
There is nothing in the power of creatures; _O God_, it is Thou who hast created the different worlds.
Some Thou blendest with Thyself; others Thou leadest astray from Thee.
I Thou art known by the favour of the Guru, through whom Thou revealest Thyself.
_They who know Thee_ are easily absorbed in the True One.

## SLOK XII

_Guru Nanak_

Pain is medicine, _worldly_ pleasure a disease; where there is such pleasure, there is no desire _for God_.
Thou art the Doer, I do nothing; if I try to do anything, it cometh to nothing.

<span id="p234">[<sup><small>p. 234</small></sup>]</span>

I am a sacrifice _unto Thee_; Thou abidest in Thine omnipotence:
Thine end cannot be seen.
Thy light pervadeth creatures; creatures are contained in Thy light; Thou fillest inanimate and animate creation.[^1]
Thou art the true Lord; beautiful is Thy praise; he who uttereth it is saved.
Nanak uttereth the words of the Creator; what is to be done _God_ continueth to do.

_Guru Angad_

The Jogis deem it their duty to acquire divine knowledge, the Brahmans to read the Veds,
The Khatris _to exercise_ bravery, the Sudars to work for others;
But the highest duty of all is to repeat the name of the one God.[^2]
He who knoweth the secret of this
Is a bright God himself, and Nanak is his slave.

_Guru Angad_

There is one God, the God of all gods, the Supreme God of souls.
He who knoweth the secrets of the soul and of God,
Is a bright God himself, and Nanak is his slave.

_Guru Nanak_

Water remaineth if confined in a vessel; _but_ it cannot remain without a vessel.
The mind controlled by divine knowledge is restrained; _but_ without a guru there can be no divine knowledge.

<span id="p235">[<sup><small>p. 235</small></sup>]</span>

## PAURI XII

When the literate man is sinful _he deserveth Punishment_; but punish not the illiterate saint.
As man acteth so shall he be described.
Play not such a game as shall bring thee defeat on arriving at God's court.
The literate and the illiterate shall be judged hereafter The headstrong shall be punished in the next world.

## SLOK XIII

_Guru Nanak_

Nanak, this body of ours[^1] hath one carriage and one driver.
They are both changed in every age: the holy man knoweth this.
In the Sat age contentment was the carriage, piety the driver in front;
In the Treta age continence was the carriage, strength the driver in front;
In the Dwapar age penance was the carriage, truth the driver in front;
In the Kal age passion[^2] is the carriage, falsehood the driver in front.

_Guru Nanak_

The Sam _Ved_ saith that the Lord is white-robed,[^3] that men desired truth, abode in truth, and that all were absorbed in truth.
The Rig saith that God's name is everywhere contained, that it is as the sun in heaven;
That by repeating it sins depart,

<span id="p236">[<sup><small>p. 236</small></sup>]</span>

And that then, Nanak, man obtaineth salvation.
The Yajur _stateth_ that Kan Krishan, who was a Yadav, seduced Chandrawal;
That he brought the tree of life for a milkmaid, and amused himself in Bindraban.
The Atharv belongeth to the Kal age, when God's name was called Allah.
Men then wore blue clothes, and the Turks and Pathans exercised sway.
The four Veds are true _according to the Hindus_; but if they are read and studied there _are found therein_ four _different_ doctrines;
When man hath love and devotion and is himself lowly, it is then, O Nanak, he obtaineth salvation.

## PAURI XIII

I am a sacrifice to the true Guru by meeting whom the Lord is remembered,
Who gave me the salve of divine instruction; with these eyes I then beheld God in the world.
The dealers who leave the Lord and attach themselves to mammon are wrecked.
The true Guru is a boat; few there are who consider this, And those _who do_ he mercifully saveth.

## SLOK XIV

_Guru Nanak_

The simmal-tree of the desert is very tall and very thick.
Why should the birds which go to it with hopes depart disappointed?
Because its fruit is insipid, its flowers unwholesome, and its leaves useless.
The tree which yieldeth sweet fruit is lowly, O Nanak,
but its qualities and virtues are exquisite.
Every one boweth to himself; no one boweth to another.
If anything be put into a scale and weighed, the side which descendeth is the heavier.[^1]

<span id="p237">[<sup><small>p. 237</small></sup>]</span>

The wicked man like a deer-stalker boweth twice _more than any one else_;
But what availeth bowing the head, if the heart be impure?

The following hymn was composed by Guru Nanak at Banaras on the occasion of a discussion with the local _pandits_ who pressed him to dress in
the style of the Hindus:—

_Guru Nanak_

You read books, perform your twilight devotions, argue, worship stones, and sit like cranes;
You utter falsehoods as excellent jewels; you meditate on the Gayatri[^1] three times a day;
You wear necklaces, put sacrificial marks on your foreheads, _carry_ two _dhotis_, and put towels on your heads.
If you knew God's designs, you _would know that yours_ is verily a vain religion.
Saith Nanak, verily reflect that without the true Guru you shall not find the way.

Some suppose that the following was addressed to Sultan Ibrahim Khan Lodi who it is believed at one
time sought to persecute the Guru:—

## PAURI XIV

Raiment and pleasing beauty man must leave on earth and depart.
Man shall obtain _the fruit_ of the bad or good deeds he hath done:
He may have exercised sovereignty to his heart's content, yet must he proceed by the narrow road.
He shall be sent naked to hell, which will then appear very formidable to him;
And he shall regret the sins he committed.

The following slok, addressed by Guru Nanak to pandit Hardial, his family priest, when he came to invest him with a janeu, the sacrificial thread of the upper classes of Hindus, has already been given:—

## SLOK XV

Make mercy thy cotton, contentment thy thread, continence its knot, truth its twist.
That would make a janeu for the soul; if thou have it, O Brahman, then put it on me.
It will not break, or become soiled, or be burned, or lost.
Blest the man, O Nanak, who goeth with such a thread on his neck.
Thou purchasest a janeu for four damris, and seated in a square puttest it on;
Thou whisperest instruction that the Brahman is the guru _of the Hindus_\—
Man dieth, the janeu falleth, and _the soul_ departeth with out it.

_Guru Nanak_

_Though men commit_ countless thefts, countless adulteries, litter countless falsehoods and countless _words_ of abuse;
_Though they commit_ countless robberies and villanies night and day against their _fellow_ creatures;
_Yet_ the cotton thread is spun, and the Brahman cometh to twist it.
_For the ceremony_ they kill a goat and cook and eat it, and everybody then saith ‘Put on the janeu ’.
When it becometh old, it is thrown away and another is put on.
Nanak, the string breaketh not if it be strong.

_Guru Nanak_

By adoring and praising. the Name honour and a true thread are obtained.
_In this way_ a sacred thread shall be put on, which will not break, and which will be fit for entrance into _God's_ court.

_Guru Nanak_

There is no string for the sexual organs, there is no string for women;
_There is no string for the impure acts which cause_ your beards to be daily spat upon.
There is no string for the feet, there is no string for the hands,

<span id="p239">[<sup><small>p. 239</small></sup>]</span>

There is no string for the tongue, there is no string for the eyes.
Without such strings _the Brahman_ wandereth astray,
Twisteth strings _for the neck_, and putteth them on others.
He taketh hire for marrying;
He pulleth out a paper, and showeth the fate _of the wedded pair_.[^1]
Hear and see, ye people, it is strange
That, while mentally blind, man is named wise.

## PAURI XV

He to whom the Lord is compassionate and merciful will do the Master's work.
That worshipper whom God causeth to abide by His order, will worship Him.
By obeying His order man is acceptable, and shall then reach his Master's court.
He shall act as pleaseth his Master, and obtain the fruit his heart desireth;
And he shall be clothed with a robe of honour in _God's_ court.

A man at Lahore presented a cow to a Brahman. The Brahman took her with him, but had not wherewithal to pay toll at the Sultanpur ferry. He was stopped by the Khatri toll-keeper. The latter collected the cow's dung, and at once set about plastering his cooking-place therewith. Mardana went towards him, but was ordered off, lest he should defile the toll-keeper's cooking-place. Upon this Guru Nanak uttered the following:—

## SLOK XVI

Thou takest toll for a cow and a Brahman, the cow-dung will not save thee.
Thou wearest a dhoti[^2] and a frontal mark, and carriest a rosary, _yet_ thou eatest the bread of malechhas.

<span id="p240">[<sup><small>p. 240</small></sup>]</span>

Thou performest the Hindu worship at home, thou readest the Quran _in public_, and associatest with Muhammadans,[^1] O my brother.
Lay aside hypocrisy, repeat God's name, and thou shalt be saved.

_Guru Nanak_

They who have strings on their necks eat men, recite the Muhammadan prayers,
And use knives to _cut men's throats_.[^2]
Although the Brahmans sound shells in their houses,
And enjoy their viands as they do themselves;[^3]
Yet false is their capital and false their dealings.
By uttering falsehood they maintain themselves.
Far from them is the abode of bashfulness and honesty: Nanak, falsehood everywhere prevaileth.
On their foreheads are sacrificial marks; _on thei_r waists reddish[^4] dhotis;
And in their hands knives; they are the world's butchers.
Putting on blue clothes, they are acceptable in the _Muhammadans'_ court,
And, while taking bread from the malechhas, worship the Purans.
They eat he-goats killed with unspeakable words,[^5]
And allow no one to enter their cooking squares.
Having smeared a space they draw lines around it,
And sit within, false that they are,
Saying, 'Touch not! O touch not!
‘_Or_ this food of ours will be defiled.’
But their bodies are defiled; what they do is defiled;

<span id="p241">[<sup><small>p. 241</small></sup>]</span>

Their hearts are false while they perform ablutions _after their meals_.
Saith Nanak, meditate on the True One;
If thou art pure, thou shalt obtain Him.

## PAURI XVI

All are within Thy ken, O Lord; Thou seest all, and Thou movest them beneath Thy glance.
God himself bestoweth greatness; He Himself causeth men to do good works.
He is the greatest of the great; great is His world; He appointeth _all men_ to their respective duties.
If He cast a backward glance, He maketh monarchs as grass;[^1]
They may beg from door to door and receive no alms.

Guru Nanak composed the following slok on being invited by a dishonest shopkeeper to attend a _shradh_, or religious service, for his deceased father:—

## SLOK XVII

If a robber break a house and sacrifice the fruits of that robbery to his ancestors,
The sacrifice shall be known in the next world, and make out the ancestors to be thieves.
The hand of the _Brahman_ go-between shall be cut off; thus will _God_ do justice.
Nanak, it is only the fruit of what man giveth from his earnings and toil that shall be obtained in the next world.

_Guru Nanak_

As a woman hath her recurring courses, so falsehood dwelleth in the mouth of the false one, and he is ever despised.
He should not be called pure who sitteth and washeth his body;
_Rather is_ he pure, Nanak, in whose heart God dwelleth.

<span id="p242">[<sup><small>p. 242</small></sup>]</span>

## PAURI XVII

Caparisoned horses fleet as the wind and women adorned with every aid to beauty[^1]—
Men fix their hearts on them, dwell in mansions, pavilions and palaces, and make display;
They enjoy pleasures to their hearts' content; but they know not God and therefore fail.
They live by their authority, and, beholding their women's chambers, forget death;
But old age shall come and youth fail them.

A rich man gave a feast to which Guru Nanak and several Brahmans were invited. During the feast a child was born in the house, whereupon the Brahmans refused food and. departed, deeming the house impure. Guru Nanak remonstrated with the following:—

## SLOK XVIII

If the idea of impurity be admitted, there is impurity in everything.
There are worms in cow-dung[^2] and in wood;
There is no grain of corn without life.
In the first place, there is life in water by which everything is made green.
How shall we avoid impurity? It falleth on our kitchens.
Saith Nanak, impurity is not thus washed away: it is washed away by divine knowledge.[^3]

_Guru Nanak_

Impurity of the heart is greed, impurity of the tongue is falsehood;
Impurity of the eyes is gazing on another's wealth, his wife, and her beauty;
Impurity of the ears is listening to slander.

<span id="p243">[<sup><small>p. 243</small></sup>]</span>

Nanak, even the _pretended_ saint who _practiseth such things_, shall go bound to hell.
All impurity consisteth in Superstition and attachment to worldly things.
Birth and death are ordained; as it pleaseth God, we come and go.
The eating and drinking which God sent as sustenance are pure.
Nanak, the Pious persons who know God have no impurity,

## PAURI XVIII

Magnify and praise the True Guru in whom there is all greatness.
If the Guru cause us to meet God, we shall behold _His greatness_.
If it please _the Guru_, he will cause _God's praises_ to dwell in the heart.
He putteth his hand on our foreheads; and when he giveth the order, removeth evil from within us.
When God is pleased the nine treasures are obtained.

## SLOK XIX

_The Brahman_ having first purified himself sitteth in a purified _square_.
The purified food is placed before him; no one may touch it.
Being thus purified, he beginneth to eat and read Sanskrit verses.
If it is thrown into a filthy place; whose fault is that?
The corn was holy, the water was holy, the fire and salt
were holy; when the fifth _ingredient_, _ghi_,[^1] was added,
Then the food became holy.
When the food entereth a sinful body, it _becometh impure as if_ spat upon.
The mouth which uttereth not the Name, and eateth even delicacies without the Name,
Consider, O Nanak, as if spat upon.

<span id="p244">[<sup><small>p. 244</small></sup>]</span>

The following was Guru Nanak's remonstrance to a man who reviled the female sex:—

_Guru Nanak_

In a vessel[^1] man is conceived, from a vessel he is born, with a vessel he is betrothed and married.
With a vessel he contracteth friendship; with a vessel he goeth through the world.
When one vessel dieth, another is sought for; to a vessel he is bound.
Why call her bad from whom are born kings?
From a vessel a vessel is born; none may exist without a vessel.
Nanak, only the one True God is independent of a vessel.
The mouth which ever praiseth _Him_[^2] is fortunate and beautiful.
Nanak, that face shall be bright in the court of the True One.

## PAURI XIX

Every one calleth Thee his own, O Lord; those who do not so call Thee Thou puttest away.
Every one must _bear the result of his_ own acts, and adjust his own account.
Since ye are not to remain in this world, why practise ye pride?
Call no one bad; know this by reading these words.
Dispute not with a fool.

## SLOK XX

Nanak, the mind and body of him who talketh evil are evil:
He is most evil, and most evil is his reputation.
The evil person is rejected in God's court; his face is spat upon.
The evil person is a fool, and receiveth shoe-beatings as punishment.

<span id="p245">[<sup><small>p. 245</small></sup>]</span>

_Guru Nanak_

If a man, foul within and fair without, Puff himself up in the world,
His filth will not depart even though he bathe at the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage.
They who wear silk within and rags without, are good in this world.
They have conceived love for God and contemplate beholding Him.
In God's love they weep, in God's love they laugh, or are even silent.
They care not for anything except the true Master.
They beg for food at _God's_ door, and _only_ eat when He giveth it to them.
For them there is but one court as there is but one pen;[^1] we and you shall meet for justice.
The accounts of _the wicked_ shall be examined in God's court, and they shall be pressed, O Nanak, like oil in a mill.[^2]

## PAURI XX

Thou Thyself didst create the world, and Thou Thyself didst infuse power into it.
Thou beholdest Thine own work, the losing and winning dice[^3] upon earth.
Whatever hath come shall depart; his turn shall come to every one.
Why forget that Lord who owneth life and soul
With thine own hands arrange thine own affairs.

<span id="p246">[<sup><small>p. 246</small></sup>]</span>

## SLOK XXI

_Guru Angad_

What love is that which attacheth itself to worldly things?
Nanak, call him a lover who is ever absorbed in God.
He who deemeth what is good good, and what is bad bad,
Shall not be called a true lover if he proceed in this manner.[^1]

_Guru Angad_

He who offereth salutation and _at the same time_ criticizeth _God's works_, hath made a mistake from the beginning.
Both _his salutation and criticism_ are in vain; Nanak, such a person shall not obtain a place in _God's court_.

## PAURI XXI

Ever remember that Lord by worshipping whom thou shalt find happiness.
Why hast thou done such evil deeds as thou shalt suffer for?
Do absolutely nothing evil, look well before thee;
So throw the dice that thou mayest not lose with the Lord,
Nay, that thou mayest gain some profit.

## SLOK XXII

_Guru Angad_

When a servant while performing service is proud and quarrelsome besides,
And talketh too much, he pleaseth not his master.
If he efface himself and perform service, he shall obtain some honour.
Nanak, he who longeth for God shall meet Him, and his longing shall be acceptable.

<span id="p247">[<sup><small>p. 247</small></sup>]</span>

_Guru Angad_

What a man hath in his heart cometh forth; lip-worship is of no avail.
Man soweth poison and expecteth ambrosia; behold that for justice!

_Guru Angad_

Contracting friendship with a fool would never be profitable.
He acteth according to his understanding: let any one see and inquire into this.
One thing can be put into a vessel if another be _first_ removed.[^1]
Commands will not succeed with God; supplications must be addressed to Him.
By practising falsehood falsehood is obtained: Nanak, there is pleasure in praising God.

_Guru Angad_

Friendship for a fool and love for a great man
Are like lines drawn on water, which leave neither trace nor mark.

_Guru Angad_

If a man be a fool and do anything, he cannot do it well
Even though he do one or two things well, he will spoil the rest.

## PAURI XXII

If the servant who is employed in service act according to his master's wishes,
His honour is all the more, and he receiveth double wages.
If he vie with his master, he will excite his jealousy,
Lose his large salary, and receive shoe-beating on the mouth.
Thank Him by whose gifts thou liveth
Nanak, commands will not succeed with Him; the Master must be implored,

<span id="p248">[<sup><small>p. 248</small></sup>]</span>

## SLOK XXIII

_Guru Angad_

What sort of gift is that which we obtain by our own _asking_?
Nanak, wonderful is the gift we obtain when the Lord is pleased.

_Guru Angad_

What sort of service is that in which the fear of the master departeth not?[^1]
Nanak, he is called a servant who is absorbed in the love of his master.

## PAURI XXIII

Nanak, God's end is not seen, nor hath He a thither or a hither side.
He Himself createth, and He Himself again destroyeth.
Some have chains on their necks, and some ride on many horses.
It is God who causeth to act and who acteth Himself to whom else shall we complain?
Nanak, it is for Him who made the world to take care of it.

## SLOK XXIV

_Guru Nanak_

It is God Himself who made vessels[^2] and He Himself who filleth them.
In some is contained milk[^3] others are put over the fire.
Some sleep on mattresses, and others stand and watch over them
Nanak, God regenerateth those on whom He looketh with favour.

<span id="p249">[<sup><small>p. 249</small></sup>]</span>

_Guru Angad_

God Himself arrangeth, He Himself putteth what He hath made into its proper place;
Having in this world created animals, He Himself be holdeth their birth and death.
Whom shall we address, O Nanak, since God doeth every thing Himself?

## PAURI XXIV

The greatness of the great God cannot be expressed;
He is the Creator, the Omnipotent, the Bounteous; He provideth His creatures with sustenance.
Man must do the work which God destined for him from the beginning.
Nanak, except in the one God alone there is no _abiding_ Place.
He doeth what He pleaseth.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The word Wâr originally meant a dirge for the brave slain in battle, then it meant any song of praise, and in this collection it means God's praises generally. _Wârs_ were composed in stanzas called _pauris_, literally ladders, which were sung or chanted by professional minstrels.
  The _Âsa ki Wâr_ is repeated by religious Sikhs after the _Japji_ as a morning divine service.

[^2]: As, son of Chitrbîr, was a holy prince against whom a false charge had been preferred by his lascivious stepmother, which led to his hands and feet being cut off as punishment. One of the many Oriental versions of the story of Potiphar's wife.

[^1]: In the original, Mahala I. It is so written to mark the distinction between the preceding verses, which are _sloks_, and the following verses, which are in a different measure.

[^2]: By separating from Himself.

[^1]: Also translated—By Thy power was created animate and inanimate nature.

[^2]: _Mân abhmân_. The latter word is for _apmân_, as so often in the Granth Sahib. Compare _mân abhimân madhê so sewak nâhîn_, He who hath regard for honour or dishonour is not a holy man.

[^1]: The fear of God is, of course, meant.

[^2]: _Adânê_, from the Sanskrit _ûdûgan_. The phrase is also translated—In fear is the firmament extended.

[^3]: Literally—God hath written the destiny of fear on tile heads of all.

[^1]: _Jhâlâ_ is a woman's head of hair. The actors, who in India are generally all men, wear female wigs.

[^2]: _Bhini_. Literally—dewy; when the atmosphere is calm and the heat not excessive.

[^1]: Some suppose _kâr_ to be a noun meaning the lines Hindus draw on the ground to enclose cooking-places, within which others are not
admitted.

[^2]: The Jogis, when in intensely deep meditation, close their eves. On opening them and looking upward they suppose that they behold God in their own image in the firmament.

[^1]: Also translated—
  (_a_) Treat men according to their acts.
  (_b_) Treat others as thou wouldst be treated thyself.

[^1]: Literally-Have not put their feet into evil.

[^2]: There are two forms of Jog or exercise for the union of the soul with God. _Sahaj jog_ or _râj jog_ is the repetition of God's name with fixed attention and association with the holy, as contradistinguished from the _hath jog_ of Patanjali, the severest and most painful form of a Jogi's austerities.

\[1 Several faqîrs do not eat corn, some go naked, some practise perpetual silence, some go barefooted, some eat filth, &c.

[^2]: The gyanis generally translate—If a man go barefooted, he is _merely_ suffering for his folly.

[^3]: Also translated—I beg _for a sight_ of those who meditate on Thee.

[^1]: Also translated—Thy power (_kala_) is inconceivable (_a_, not, and _kalna_, to know).

[^2]: Also translated—
  The Jogis speak of divine knowledge, the Brahmans of the Veds;
  The Khatris of bravery, the Sûdars of working for others.
  All that they speak is concerning the one God.

[^1]: _Meru_ is the large bead in which the two ends of a rosary are joined, without which it is believed that prayers repeated on the rosary are of no avail. _Mer sharîr_ here means man's body, which is superior to that of other animals.

[^2]: _Agan_. Literally—fire. This word is often used for wrath, but Guru Nanak has more often inveighed against avarice or covetousness than against wrath, and perhaps it is the former that is taken as a special attribute of this degenerate age.

[^3]: _Setambar_. The Hans or Swan avatar.

[^1]: The man who is lowly is the most worthy.

[^1]: _Traipâl_ is understood to be for _tripada_, the _gâyatri_ or spell of the Hindus.

[^1]: That is, he draws a horoscope.

[^2]: _Dhoti_ is a cloth tied round the loins, the Latin _subligaculum_.

[^1]: Also translated—Thou actest like Muhammadans.

[^2]: Also translated—They who read prayers devour men, and they who wear strings on their necks ply knives.

[^3]: According to the holy books of the Hindus, Brahmans should not eat in the houses of men who recite Muhammadan prayers.

[^4]: _Kâkhâi_, reddish, or partially soiled from frequent washing The w word is also applied to the tucking in of a _dhoti_ in a particular way.

[^5]: The Muhammadan expression _Bismillâh_ (in the name of God), used when slaughtering animals as well as on other occasions. It is, of course, unacceptable to Hindus.

[^1]: _Ghâh_. Generally translated ‘grass-cutters’ by the gyânis: a third interpretation too is current. In former times men of position appeared before conquerors with grass in their mouths, implying that they were the conquerors' cows whose lives should be saved. Accordingly, the phrase is also translated—and He would cause kings to put grass in their mouths.

[^1]: _Har rangi_. Literally—with every colour.

[^2]: In India cow-dung, besides being used for religious purposes, is ordinarily used as fuel by poor people.

[^3]: In the current _Janamsâkhis_ it is stated that this slok was composed on the proposed purification of the Guru's house after the birth of his son, Sri Chand.

[^1]: Clarified butter, always deemed pure by Hindus and kindred sects.

[^1]: Woman is meant.' The Greeks sometimes used the word {Greek skeu^os} in the same sense.

[^2]: Some suppose that woman is the missing word here, as the preceding part of the slok is a defence of women, not a eulogy of God.

[^1]: That is, there is no mediator between God and man. It is God Himself who decides man's fate.

[^2]: This with half the last line is also translated-They who confound _meum_ and _tuum_ shall have their accounts examined in God's court, and shall be pressed, O Nanak, like oil in a mill.

[^3]: That is, the sinners and the virtuous. The game of _chausar_ or _chaupar_ is played with sixteen pieces, called _sâris_, and three dice, called _pâsâ_. The _sâris_ while being moved round the board, like creatures in transmigration, are called _kachi_, unripe: when they reach their goal, they are called _pakki_, or ripe.

[^1]: He shall not be called a lover, if he rail at God in adversity. This idea often occurs in Oriental poetry.

[^1]: The love of God will enter man's heart if he first expel worldly love.

[^1]: That is, when perfect understanding does not exist between master and servant, and the service is performed without love.

[^2]: Here the word _bhânde_ means human beings generally.

[^3]: That is, God's love, milk being deemed pure.
