## SAHASKRITI SLOKS OF GURU ARJAN

[^1]

<p style="text-align:center;">ADDRESSED TO</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">KRISHAN LAL AND HAR LAL, TWO BRAHMANS WHO WENT FROM BANARAS TO VISIT THE GURU.</p>

God preserves the holy man.

A huntsman on seeing a deer may discharge hundreds of thousands of arrows _and miss him_ ;
So he whom God preserveth, O Nanak, shall not have a hair of his head touched.

The life of a king, however great, hangs by a hair :—

A king may make many efforts; strong and brave men may serve him on every side ;
He may dwell in a steep and lofty place, and never think of death ;
But when the order of God cometh, O Nanak, an ant can take away his life.

Dismiss all anxiety for thy relations and love God alone :—

Be not anxious for thy mother, father, brother, or for men ;
Be not anxious for wife, son, friend ; being occupied with them is to be subject to mammon.
One merciful all-pervading God is the Cherisher of all beings.

The holy man is the real hero :—

All the saints are an invincible army of heroes who have donned the armour of humility ;
The repetitions of God’s praises are their weapons, the Guru’s words their shelter and the bucklers in their hands ;
They are mounted on horses, chariots, and elephants, and know God’s way ;
They walk fearlessly among the armies of their enemies, and charge them with.God’s praises ; <span id="p431"><sup><small>[ p. 431 ]</small></sup></span>
They conquer the world, O Nanak, and take captive the five thieves.

Man is debased without the Guru’s instruction :—

The life of mortal without the Guru’s instruction is accursed and defiled.
The blockhead is not equal to a dog, a donkey, a raven, or a snake.

Death cannot affect the holy :—

Nanak, Death’s myrmidons shall not look at him who worshippeth God’s lotus feet,
Keepeth God’s name in his heart, and singeth His praises in the company of the saints.

All earthly things may be gained, but not devotion without God’s grace :—

Not difficult to obtain are wealth and beauty; not difficult to obtain is the sovereignty of demigods ;
Not difficult to obtain are pleasing viands ; not difficult to obtain is elegant raiment ;
Not difficult to obtain are sons, friends, brothers, and relations ; not difficult to obtain are woman’s favours ;
Not difficult to obtain is accomplishment in learning ; not difficult to obtain are cleverness and dexterity ;
But God’s name alone is difficult to obtain ; Nanak, it is obtained by His favour in the company of saints.

The six attributes of the saint :—

He is called a holy man and perfect saint who is filled with the following six fairs of qualities—

Who possesseth the spell of God’s name, and meditateth on Him who filleth every place ;
Who deemeth woe and weal as the same, and whose life is pure and without enmity ;
Who is compassionate to all creatures, and who hath expelled the five deadly sins ;
Who subsisteth on God’s praises, and who abideth in the world untouched by it as the lotus in the water ; <span id="p432"><sup><small>[ p. 432 ]</small></sup></span>
Who instructeth friend and enemy alike, who loveth God’s Service ;
Who heareth not slander of others, and abandoning pride becometh the dust of all men’s feet.

The deadly sins :—

O love, thou art an invincible hero in the fight ; thou crushest even the very powerful.
Thou fascinatest the company of the musicians of heaven, demigods, men, beasts, and birds.[^2]
I bow to God the Creator ; Nanak seeketh the protection of the Lord of the world.

O lust, _thou givest_ an abode in hell ; thou causest man to wander in many a womb ;
Thou stealest the heart, thou pervadest the three worlds, thou destroyest devotion, penance, and virtue ;
Thou conferrest scant happiness, O bodiless [^3] one, thou art fickle, thou fillest high and low ;
But fear of thee, saith Nanak, is dispelled by associating with the saints and taking shelter in God.

O wrath, thou root of strife, there is never mercy in thee.
Thou takest sinful mortals in thy power, and causest them to dance like monkeys.
By association with thee man is debased : the myrmidons of Death inflict various punishments on him.
Nanak prayeth, O Destroyer of the sorrows of the poor, merciful God, preserve all creatures from wrath.

O thievish covetousness, thou playest many a prank with the great. <span id="p433"><sup><small>[ p. 433 ]</small></sup></span>
Through thee the wandering mind greatly wavereth in every way and manner.
Thou hast no respect for friend, or lover, or relation, or parent.
What ought not to be done thou doest ; what ought not to be eaten thou eatest ; what ought not be to made, thou makest—such is thy reputation.
Take me, take me into Thy protection, O God! this is Nanak’s prayer, O King of men.

O sinful pride, source of transmigration,
Thou abandonest friends and holdest fast unto enemies ; thou spreadest many an illusion.
Through thee the soul groweth weary of transmigration, and suffereth much pain.
Through thee man roameth astray in the terrible wilderness, and contracteth very dire and incurable maladies.
The only physician is the supreme Brahm, the supreme Being, whom Nanak worshippeth.

The following prayer is repeated by many Sikhs while performing their morning ablutions :—

O Lord of the soul, Gobind, Ocean of mercy, Guru of the world ;
O Destroyer of the world’s grievances, full of compassion, dispel every sorrow.
O Thou, capable of affording shelter, merciful Lord of the poor, have mercy on us.
Nanak, when _God whether_ called Ram, Damodar, or Madhwa is remembered, this perishable body obtaineth comfort.

God’s power :—

The power with which God supported the firmament, and enclosed fire in timber ;
The power with which He supported the moon, the sun, and the lunar mansions, and infused light and breath into the body ;

The power with which He cherished the embryo in the mother’s womb and protected it from the fire of its dwelling— <span id="p434"><sup><small>[ p. 434 ]</small></sup></span>
With the same power, O Nanak, God restrained His seas and allowed not the world to be wasted by their waves.

By devotion apparent impossibilities may be accomplished. This couplet is recited by gyanis as an introduction to the reading of the Granth Sahib :—

By remembering God in the company of the saints,
O Nanak, and seeking His protection,
Mosquitoes can pierce rocks, ants cross mire,
Cripples traverse the ocean, and blind men see even in the darkness.

God is not in the guise of the Hindu deity Vishnu:—

God hath no shell, no quoit, no mace, nor is He of sable colour ; wonderful is His form; He is unborn.
The Veds describe Him as indescribable.
He is the Most High, the Illimitable, the Indestructible ;
He dwelleth in the hearts of the saints; Nanak, they who know Him are very fortunate.

When God is merciful, miraculous events occur :—

Nanak representeth, when God is merciful
A mountain becometh a blade of grass, and what is dry becometh green ;
They who are drowning swim, they who are empty are filled,
And millions of suns shine in the darkness.

<p style="text-align:center;">GATHA</p>[^4]

<p style="text-align:center;">1</p>

Camphor, flowers, and perfumes become impure by touching man’s body.
Nanak, the ignorant are proud of the fat, blood, foul odours, and bones of which their bodtes are composed.

<p style="text-align:center;">2</p>

Were man to traverse with his eye the sky, the continents, the worlds, <span id="p435"><sup><small>[ p. 435 ]</small></sup></span>
And its regions even to the smallest particle thereof, O Nanak, nothing could be obtained without the saint.

<p style="text-align:center;">3</p>

Know that death is real, and everything else that appeareth is unreal. God’s praise, saith Nanak, which is obtained by association with the saints shall alone accompany us.

<p style="text-align:center;">4</p>

The mind wandereth to mammon, lovers, friends, and relations.
Nanak, the abode of happiness which consisteth in worshipping God is obtained by association with the saints.

<p style="text-align:center;">5</p>

The nim-tree by association with sandal becometh as sandal,
Nanak, while the bamboo, even though it dwelleth near, is not perfumed through its pride.

<p style="text-align:center;">6</p>

By repeating and reflecting on the discourse in which God’s name is interwoven, pride is effaced.
Nanak, by letting fly the arrow of God’s name the five enemies are destroyed.

<p style="text-align:center;">7</p>

The word of the saint is the path of peace ; it is obtained by greatly meritorious deeds.
Nanak, there is no transmigration for him who uttereth God’s praises.

<p style="text-align:center;">8</p>

When leaves wither and fall, they return not again to the tree.
Nanak, without the Name there is suffering ; man’s days and nights pass in transmigration.

<p style="text-align:center;">9</p>

The very fortunate who love the association of saints obtain God.
Nanak, he who repeateth God’s name and praises returneth not to the ocean of the world. 

<span id="p436"><sup><small>[ p. 436 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">10</p>

Discourses _on God_ are profound and endless, and few are there who understand them.
_They who understand them_, Nanak, abandon worldly desires, and repeat God’s name in the company of saints.

<p style="text-align:center;">11</p>

Tak The saint’s word is the prime spell; through it millions of sins are blotted out :
Nanak, by meditating on God’s lotus feet whole families are saved.

<p style="text-align:center;">12</p>

Beautiful is that temple in which God’s praises are sung.
Nanak, the utterance of God’s name, which only the fortunate obtain, affordeth deliverance.

<p style="text-align:center;">13</p>

The true triends, the saints, find God the Friend who never vexeth man’s heart. 
Nanak hath made Him whose abode and greatness are immeasurable, the companion of his soul.

<p style="text-align:center;">14</p>

Dishonour is effaced by a good son
Who remembereth in his heart the Guru’s spell,
And loveth, O Nanak, God the permanent,
Who taketh man across the world’s ocean.

<p style="text-align:center;">15</p>

To forget God is death ; To meditate on His name is life.
Nanak, God is found by association with the saints,
Which is obtained by primal destiny.

<p style="text-align:center;">16</p>

As the spell of the snake-charmer draweth the fangs of the serpent,
So, Nanak, the saint who is found by good fortune removeth misery.

<span id="p437"><sup><small>[ p. 437 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">17</p>

God pervadeth every place and giveth shelter to. all souls ;
Nanak, His love toucheth the heart when the Guru extendeth his favour and showeth himself.

<p style="text-align:center;">18</p>

When God’s lotus feet cleave the heart, All comfort is obtained.
Nanak, from the most ancient times the ay saints sing God’s praises.

<p style="text-align:center;">19</p>

They who utter instructive words and walk with the saints shall be saved :
In the ocean of the world, Nanak, they shall not again obtain birth.

<p style="text-align:center;">20</p>

Men may study the Veds, the Purans, and the Shastars,
But it is the name of the one God that should be clasped to the heart.
He who claspeth it to his heart saveth whole families.
Nanak, very fortunate are the few who can thus save.

<p style="text-align:center;">21</p>

Nanak, the remembrance of God’s name which saveth whole families,
Is obtained by associating with saints, whom only the very fortunate behold.

<p style="text-align:center;">22</p>

The saints remove all sin and implant all faith in the heart ; Nanak, they on whose foreheads it is so written obtain association with them.

<p style="text-align:center;">23</p>

God was, is, and shall be; it is He who destroyeth and createth all things. Nanak, know for certain that holy men are the cause of God’s love.

<span id="p438"><sup><small>[ p. 438 ]</small></sup></span>

Man loveth not the Word which conferreth happiness ; he is attached to _fleeting things like_ the safflower dye;
Nanak, he obtaineth not spiritual happiness even in a dream: disease, sorrow, and separation from God are his portion.

<p style="text-align:center;">PUNHAS</p>

The following quatrains are said to have been addressed by the Guru to Harihan, his wife’s sister, who asked him to compose some devotional verses. In most of them her name is inserted. Others suppose that Harihan is a measure and means the same as Punha :—

<p style="text-align:center;">1</p>

The pen in the hand of the Inscrutable One writeth on the forehead.
He whose form is incomparable is concerned with all.
Thy praises, O God, cannot be expressed.
Nanak, on beholding Thee is fascinated and a sacrifice for a sight of Thee.

<p style="text-align:center;">2</p>

Seated in the company of the saints, I utter God’s praises ;
I dedicate to Him all my decorations, and give Him all my soul.
Thirsting that He will come, I have made my Spouse’s couch.
Harihan, when destiny is recorded on the forehead, we meet the Friend.

<p style="text-align:center;">3</p>

O my companions, a woman may prepare everything— lamp-black for the eyes, necklaces, betel ;
She may take the sixteen decorations and apply anjan to her eyes ;
Yet it is only when the spouse visiteth her she obtaineth everything.
O Harihan, without the Spouse all decorations are vain.

<span id="p439"><sup><small>[ p. 439 ]</small></sup></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">4</p>

She in whose house He abideth is very fortunate ;
All decorations become her, and she is a happy wife,
I sleep now free of care since my heart’s desires have been fulfilled.
Harihan, when God came to my house, I obtained everything.

<p style="text-align:center;">5</p>

My only hope was that my hopes might be fulfilled ;
When I met the merciful true Guru, I obtained the Perfect God.
In my body were many demerits, so that I was overspread with them.
Harihan, when the true Guru is merciful, the mind obtaineth rest.

<p style="text-align:center;">6</p>

Saith Nanak, I have meditated on God who is endless, endless.
Difficult to cross is this world, but the true Guru hath caused me to cross It.
Transmigration is at an end when the true Guru is found.
Harihan, the nectar of God’s name is obtained from the true Guru.

<p style="text-align:center;">7</p>

I am lucky ;[^5] happiness abideth in my home ;
O my companions, God who is a jewel is in my breast ; on beholding Him my sorrow departeth.
I dwell with God who is the essence of all happiness,
And in whose hand, O Harihan, ever abide wealth, perfection, and the nine treasures.

<p style="text-align:center;">8</p>

He who goeth to enjoy another’s wife shall be put to shame.
How long shall the sins of those who continually steal others’ property be concealed ? <span id="p440"><sup><small>[ p. 440 ]</small></sup></span>
By repeating God’s praises man becometh pure and saveth all his family.
Harihan, by also hearing the supreme God’s praises and meditating on Him, man becometh pure.

<p style="text-align:center;">9</p>

The heavens shine above, the earth below appeareth beautiful ;
In every direction shineth God’s light ; I long to behold His face.
I wander searching in every country to find the Dear One.
Harihan, if good fortune be recorded on the forehead, a sight of Him shall be obtained.

<p style="text-align:center;">10</p>

I have seen every place, but found none like unto thee ; [^6]
The Creator constructeth thee, O temple, therefore art thou beautiful. 
Ramdaspur is thickly populated, unparalleled, and beyond praise.
Harihan, Nanak’s impurities depart by bathing in the tank of Ram Das.

<p style="text-align:center;">11</p>

The chatrik in his heart desireth the friendly rain,
And longeth for that to which his soul is attached.
He wandereth lonely from forest to forest in quest of a drop of water.
Harihan, thus God’s servant prayeth for the Name; Nanak is a sacrifice unto him.

<p style="text-align:center;">12</p>

The Friend’s heart is beyond praise: His secrets cannot be known.
It is only he who possesseth unequalled virtues who can recognize the Real Thing.
When man’s mind is absorbed in God there is excessive love.
Harihan, he who chasteneth the thief, his fickle mind, shall obtain the wealth of the True One.

<span id="p441"><sup><small>[ p. 441 ]</small></sup></span>

In a vision the Most High appeared to me, but I could not seize His skirt.
A beautiful Being He shone; on beholding Him my heart was beguiled.
I am searching for His tracks: say how shall I find them ?
O my friend Harihan, show me by what efforts I may obtain the Beloved.

<p style="text-align:center;">14</p>

The eyes which see not the holy man are in evil case ;
The ears which hear not his instruction ought to be stopped ;
The tongue which uttereth not the Name ought to be cut in pieces—
Harihan, when man forgetteth God, he daily declineth.

<p style="text-align:center;">15</p>

_The bumble-bee_ is very proud, but he is caught in the petals of the lotus ;
His body is entangled therein and he loseth his senses ; _but the sun alloweth his escape in the morning_.
Is there any such sun[^7] as will open the hard knot _of ignorance_ for me?
Nanak, the one Lord God who uniteth what is broken hath alone _power to do so_.

<p style="text-align:center;">16</p>

I run in every direction on account of my love for God.
How shall we destroy the five troublesome enemies _the deadly sins_ ?
Shoot them with the sharp arrow of meditation on God’s name,
And, Harihan, thou shalt obtain the perfect Guru who is the destroyer of great sins.

<p style="text-align:center;">17</p>

The true Guru hath conferred gifts which are never exhausted. <span id="p442"><sup><small>[ p. 442 ]</small></sup></span>
God being pleased bestoweth the wealth of the ambrosial Name,
By eating and enjoying which all pious persons shall be saved.
Nanak, ever worship Him and thou shalt never die.

<p style="text-align:center;">18</p>

Wherever the saints go, the place is beautiful.
All happiness is obtained by meditating on God’s name.
When God’s creatures rejoice, the slanderer dieth in agony.
Nanak, the saints’ hearts are pleased reciting the Name.

<p style="text-align:center;">19</p>

God is the Purifier of sinners; why not worship Him ?
False and contemptible is love of the world; how long shall we suffer it ?
By beholding a castle in the air how canst thou be happy ?
Harihan, I am a sacrifice to those who know how to reach God’s court.

<p style="text-align:center;">20</p>

The fool, whose body is filth and very malodorous,
Hath done very many bad things.
He wandereth in the darkness of pride and thinketh not of death.
Harihan, on beholding a castle in the air why suppose it to be real

<p style="text-align:center;">21</p>

Who can preserve his life when it cometh to an end ?
The physician may prescribe endless remedies, _but they are of no avail_ ; 
Therefore, O ignorant man, remember the one God who will assist thee.
Harihan, without the Name the body is dirt, and everything is vain.

<p style="text-align:center;">2</p>
Drink the medicine of the unequalled and priceless Name : The saints eat the ambrosia of God’s name in company, and give it to all _to partake thereof_. <span id="p443"><sup><small>[ p. 443 ]</small></sup></span>
They who are so destined obtain it. Harihan, I am a sacrifice to those who enjoy God’s love.

<p style="text-align:center;">23</p>

When the assembly of the physicians [^8] is formed,
God is in the midst of them, and medicines are effectual.
Men’s acts bad and good are disclosed,[^9]
And Harihan, their troubles, diseases, and sins vanish.

<p style="text-align:center;">EXTRA SLOKS</p>

Who are real lovers :—

They are the real lovers who know God and turn not away from Him ;
They who perform no service for Him are false, and slink away.

Devotion is sufficient without decorations :—

Without the Lord I will burn silks and satins in the flames ;
With Thee, O Lord, saith Nanak, I look beautiful even when rolling in the dust.

The contempt of the world is love of God :—

By the Guru’s instruction the Name is worshipped and love for God and contempt of the world produced.
When man subdueth the five enemies the Maru Rag[^10] is profitable.

The following was addressed to a covetous Brahman ;—

If I have the one God, I have gained lakhs; how many doors for thee to beg at ?
O Brahman, thy life hath passed in vain since thou hast forgotten Him who made thee.
The punishment of sinners :— Sinners shall lament for the sins they commit : <span id="p444"><sup><small>[ p. 444 ]</small></sup></span>
Nanak, as a churning-staff churneth milk, so shall Dharmraj churn them.

The pious render their lives profitable and are honoured after death :—

The pious who meditate on the Name gain the advantage of human lives—
Nanak, Dharmraj will tell them that they have made his court holy.

Evil advisers :-—

Men sink into evil sloughs through the sweet words of evil advisers ;
Nanak, they whose good fortune is recorded on their foreheads escape _their influence_.

Baba Nanak divinely inspired :—

God gave Baba Nanak the Word as an inexhaustible wealth to use and spend ;
As long as God is merciful, so long shall that capital never diminish.

The Guru in his search for God would sell his body for wings :—

If I could find wings to purchase, I would take them for an equal weight _of my flesh_ ;
I would attach them to my body, and search for and find the Friend.

To sit with God the King of kings is the Guru’s highest honour :—

My Friend is the true monarch, the King of kings ;
To sit near Him, in whom all must have faith, is an honour.
