Unexpected help reached the Guru from various quarters. One Ganga Ram, a Brahman merchant, came from Bhatinda with corn to sell. He visited the Guru and remained with him for some time. During his stay the Guru’s kitchen one day became empty, so Ganga Ram gave up all his corn and fed for a space of five days all the labourers on the tank. As the Baisakhi fair was approaching, the Guru persuaded him to stay and enjoy it. Large offerings were made to the Guru on the occasion, all of which he ordered to be given to Ganga Ram. This was done to test his devotion and sincerity. Ganga Ram, however, refused to accept them. The Guru, who was naturally pleased at meeting such a disinterested friend, commended and blessed him.

When the tank was excavated, it was represented to the Guru that Har Mandar, or the temple of God to be built in the midst of it, should be raised higher than all other buildings in the neighbourhood, so that it might receive proper respect. The Guru replied : ‘No; what is humble shall be exalted. The more a tree is laden with fruit, the more its branches descend to the earth. By whatever way you approach the temple you must descend eight or ten steps, wherefore let the Har Mandar be made the lowest edifice of all.’ The Guru himself was humble, but through his spiritual greatness he obtained the dignity of being visited by people of rank from all parts of India and receiving their rich offerings.

Hindu temples are closed on three sides and opened only towards the east or rising sun. The great Sikh temple at Amritsar was to be open on all sides. This meant that the Sikh worship was open to all, and was not concerned with sun-worship. The Granth Sahib is placed in the middle of the temple, so that no man may seat himself in its place.

<span id="p10"><sup><small>[p. 10]</small></sup></span>

It was on the Ist of Magh, Sambat 1645 (A.D. 1589), the Guru laid the first brick of the masonry foundation of the Har Mandar, or the Darbar Sahib, now known to Europeans as the Golden Temple. A mason afterwards accidentally displaced the brick, whereupon the Guru prophesied that the foundation should again have to be laid. His words were subsequently fulfilled. Ahmad Shah Abdali, in Sambat 1819, destroyed the temple and desecrated the tank. Two years afterwards the great army of the Khalsa recovered possession of the temple, relaid its masonry foundation, and reconstructed it.

The Guru had given orders that only kiln-dried bricks should be employed. Some masands who had charge of the bricks, resolved to cheat the Guru and scamp the work. They smeared sun-dried bricks with plaster and laid them. The Guru heard of their dishonesty and ordered them to desist. They disobeyed his orders three times. He then dismissed them, and said that, when he became tenth Guru, he would visit them with condign punishment.

When the Sikhs in large numbers contributed their assistance, and the tank and temple were approaching completion, the Guru felt that God Himself had assisted in the work, and in joy and gratitude composed the following :—

God Himself came, and stood up to do the work of the saints.
Into the beautiful land and the beautiful tank He poured nectareous water.
He poured nectareous water, completed the work, and all our desires are fulfilled.
There are rejoicings in the world, and all anxiety is at an end.
The Veds and the Purans sing the praises of Him who is fixed and imperishable.
God hath been mindful of His usual function; Nanak hath meditated on His name. <span id="p11"><sup><small>[ p. 11 ]</small></sup></span>
The Creator gave me the nine treasures, wealth, and supernatural power ; I have not been in want of anything.
I have obtained happiness eating, spending, and living comfortably ; God’s gifts ever increase :
His gifts increase, are never exhausted, and I have found the Searcher of hearts.
Millions of obstacles have been removed and trouble hath not approached me.
Peace, composure, and happiness in abundance are mine, and all my craving is satisfied.
Nanak singeth the praises of the Lord ; wonderful is His praise.
He did it whose work it was ; what is wretched man ?
The saints are adorned by singing God’s praises, and ever wishing Him victory.
Pleasure is produced by singing God’s praises and forming an alliance with His saints.
How shall his [^1] praises be recounted who exerted himself in the _construction_ of the tank ?
_Bathing in this tank is equal to bathing in_ the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage, to the bestowal of alms, and the performance of great purifications.
The purification of sinners is the function of the Lord ; His word is Nanak’s support.
Treasury of excellences, my God, Creator, what praises of Thine may I utter ?
The prayer of the saint is—‘ O Lord, grant us the great elixir of Thy name.
Give us the Name ; grant us this boon, forget us not for a moment.’
O tongue, repeat God’s praises ; let us ever sing them night and day.
The mind and body of him who loveth the Name shall be filled with ambrosial essence.
Nanak representeth, my desires have been fulfilled. I live by a sight of Thee.[^2]

<span id="p12"><sup><small>[p. 12]</small></sup></span>

The following also was composed on the same occasion :—

The Creator stood in the midst _of the work_,
And not a hair _of any man’s head_ was touched.[^3]
The Guru will render ablution herein very profitable,
And by repeating God’s name sins shall depart.
O saints, Ram Das’s[^4] tank is excellent :
He who batheth in it shall save his family; his own soul too shall be saved.
He who here below singeth a song of rejoicing _over this work_,
Shall obtain the fruit his heart desireth.[^5]
He who while meditating on his God
Cometh to bathe here shall be made safe and whole.
He who batheth in the saints’ tank
Shall obtain final salvation.
Meditating on God’s name,
He shall not die or suffer transmigration.
He to whom God is merciful
Knoweth divine knowledge.
His cares and anxieties shall depart
Who seeketh the protection of Baba Nanak and God.[^6]

<span id="p13"><sup><small>[p. 13]</small></sup></span>

The Guru thus described the advantages of the tank :—

By bathing in the tank of Ram Das[^7]
All the sins that man committeth shall be done away,
And he shall become pure by his ablutions.
The perfect Guru hath given us this boon.
When we meditate on the Guru’s instruction,
God bestoweth all comfort and happiness,
And causeth the whole cargo to cross over safely.
In the association of the saints uncleanness departeth,
And the supreme Being abideth with us.
Nanak by meditating on the Name
Hath found God the primal Being.[^8]

## Notes

[^1]: The reference is to Guru Ram Das. 

[^2]: Sthi Chhant.

[^3]: That is, the Muhammadan authorities at the time did not interfere with the work.

[^4]: Ram Das may also here mean God’s servant.

[^5]: Also translated—Men will sing a song of rejoicing over this work, and obtain their heart’s desires.

[^6]: Also translated—Guru Nanak hath sought God’s protection ; and all men’s cares and anxieties shall depart. Sorath. The following is an alternative translation of this hymn :— The Creator is within me, And not a hair of my head can be touched, The Guru maketh my ablution successful. Repeat God’s name and thy sins shall be washed away. Gsod’s saints and servants form an excellent tank.* He who batheth in it shall save his own soul and the souls of all his family. The whole world shall congratulate him, And he shall obtain the reward his heart desireth. (*) From which others may draw the nectar of the Name.

[^7]: This line is also translated—By bathing in the tank of the saints of God.

[^8]: Sorath.
