By B. S. E.

THE most probable date of Jesus’ birth is 7-6 B.C. At that time Herod the Great was in difficulties with Augustus, so making possible in Palestine the census mentioned in St. Luke ii : 1-2. The name of the governor of Syria was, however, not Quirinius, but Saturninus; and there is reason to think that Luke actually wrote the latter form.

The “fifteenth year of Tiberius Ctesar” in St. Luke iii : 1 may be either 29 a.d., dating from his accession to the Emperorship, or 27 a.d., dating from his assumption of rule over Palestine.

The indication in St. John ii:20 points to about 27-28 A.D.

The year of the crucifixion cannot be computed. Astronomical calculations are of no service, for the date of the Passover was settled by actual observation of the preceding new moon. There is, of course, no way of determining now when the official Jewish observers first saw the tiny lunar thread in March of any year. Moreover, we do not know whether the Passover began on Thursday or on Friday night.

We do not know how long the ministry lasted.
