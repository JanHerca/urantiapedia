_“Our old friend,” etc._—The Master told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother. The occasion is as above.


Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a pigeon and lived in a nest-basket in the kitchen of a <span id="p196">[<sup><small>p. 196</small></sup>]</span> Benares merchant. A crow became intimate with him and lived there also. Here the story is to be expanded. The cook pulled out the crow's feathers and sprinkled him with flour, then piercing a cowrie he hung it on the crow's neck and threw him into a basket. The Bodhisatta came from the wood, and seeing him made a jest and spoke the first stanza:—

Our old friend! look at him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jewel bright he wears;
His beard in gallant trim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How gay our friend appears!

\[315\] The crow hearing him spoke the second stanza:—

My nails and hair had grown so fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hampered me in all I did:
A barber came along at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of superfluous hair I'm rid.

Then the Bodhisatta spoke the third stanza:—

Granted you got a barber then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has cropped your hair so well:
Round your neck, will you explain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's that tinkling like a bell?

Then the crow uttered two stanzas:—

Men of fashion wear a gem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the neck: it's often done:
I am imitating them:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't suppose it's just for fun.

If you're really envious
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my beard that's trimmed so true:
I can get you barbered thus;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have the jewel too.

The Bodhisatta hearing him spoke the sixth stanza:—

Nay, ’tis you they best become,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gem and beard that's trimmed so true.
I find your presence troublesome:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go with a good-day to you.

\[316\] With these words he flew up and went elsewhere; and the crow died then and there.


After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the Birth:—After the Truths, the greedy Brother was established in the fruition of the Third Path: “At that time the crow was the greedy Brother, the pigeon was myself.”
