## ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE VEDAS. TEVI<i>GG</i>A-SUTTA. CHAPTER II. THE SHORT PARAGRAPHS ON CONDUCT. THE <i>K</i>ÛLA SÎLA<i>M</i>.

[^1]

1\. ‘Now wherein, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, is his conduct good?’

‘Herein, O Vâse<i>tth</i>a, that putting away the murder of that which lives, he abstains from destroying life. The cudgel and the sword he lays aside; and, full of modesty and pity, he is compassionate and kind to all creatures that have life!

‘This is the kind of goodness that he has.

2\. 'Putting away the theft of that which is not his, he abstains from taking anything not given. He takes only what is given, therewith is he content, and he passes his life in honesty and in purity of heart!

‘This, too, is the kind of goodness that he has.

3\. 'Putting away inchastity, he lives a life of chastity and purity, averse to the low habit of sexual intercourse.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2.)[^2]

<span id="p190">[<sup><small>p. 190</small></sup>]</span>

4\. 'Putting away lying, he abstains from speaking falsehood. He speaks truth, from the truth he never swerves; faithful and trustworthy, he injures not his fellow man by deceit.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2)

5\. 'Putting away slander, he abstains from calumny. What he hears here he repeats not elsewhere to raise a quarrel against the people here: what he hears elsewhere he repeats not here to raise a quarrel against the people there. Thus he lives as a binder together of those who are divided, an encourager of those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover of peace, impassioned for peace, a speaker of words that make for peace.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2)

6\. 'Putting away bitterness of speech, he abstains from harsh language. Whatever word is humane, pleasant to the ear, lovely, reaching to the heart, urbane, pleasing to the people, beloved of the people—such are the words he speaks.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2)

7\. 'Putting away foolish talk, he abstains from vain conversation. In season he speaks; he speaks that which is; he speaks fact; he utters good doctrine; he utters good discipline; he speaks, and at the right time, that which redounds to profit, is well-grounded, is well-defined, and is full of wisdom.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2)

8\. 'He refrains from injuring any herb or any creature. He takes but one meal a day; abstaining <span id="p191">[<sup><small>p. 191</small></sup>]</span> from food at night time, or at the wrong time. He abstains from dancing, singing, music, and theatrical shows. He abstains from wearing, using, or adorning himself with garlands, and scents, and unguents, and he abstains from lofty couches and large beds.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2)

9\. 'He abstains from the getting of silver or gold. He abstains from the getting of grain uncooked. He abstains from the getting of flesh that is raw. He abstains from the getting of any woman or girl. He abstains from the getting of bondmen or bondwomen. He abstains from the getting of sheep or goats. He abstains from the getting of fowls or swine. He abstains from the getting of elephants, cattle, horses, and mares. He abstains from the getting of fields or lands.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2)

10\. 'He refrains from carrying out those commissions on which messengers can be sent. He refrains from buying and selling. He abstains from tricks with false weights, alloyed metals, or false measures. He abstains from bribery, cheating, fraud, and crooked ways.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2)

11\. 'He refrains from maiming, killing, imprisoning, highway robbery, plundering villages, or obtaining money by threats of violence.

‘This, too, (&c., see § II, 2)’

## Footnote

[^1]: There is no division into actual chapters in the original, but it is convenient to arrange the following enumeration of moral precepts separately, as they occur in various suttas in the same order—and are always divided into the three divisions of Lower, Medium, and Higher Morality.

[^2]: The clause ‘this, too, is the kind of goodness that he has’ is repeated in the text after each section. The clause, which differs {footnote p. 190} in the different suttas in which this enumeration of Buddhist morality is found, is distinct from the enumeration itself, and, like the opening reference to Vâse<i>tth</i>a, characteristic only of the particular Sutta.
