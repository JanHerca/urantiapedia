## BARRENNESS AND BONDAGE. <i>K</i>ETOKHILA-SUTTA.

1\. Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once dwelling at Sâvatthi, in the park of Anâtha Pi<i>nd</i>ika.

There the Blessed One addressed the brethren, saying, ‘Brethren!’

‘Yea, Lord!’ said those brethren, in assent, to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One spake:

2\. ‘Whatsoever brother, O Bhikkhus, has not quite become free from the five kinds of spiritual barrenness[^1], has not altogether broken through the five kinds of mental bondage[^2]—that such a one should reach up to the full advantage of, should attain to the full growth in, to full breadth in, this doctrine and discipline[^3]—that can in no wise be!’

---

3\. ‘And who has not become free from the five kinds of spiritual barrenness?’

‘In the first place, O Bhikkhus, when a brother <span id="p224">[<sup><small>p. 224</small></sup>]</span> doubts in the Teacher (Satthâ), is uncertain regarding him, has not confidence in him, and has not faith in him; then is his mind not inclined towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle.

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not become free from this first spiritual barrenness.

4\. 'And further, O Bhikkhus, when a brother doubts in the System of Belief (Dhamma), is uncertain regarding it, has not confidence in it, has not faith in it; then is his mind not inclined towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle.

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not become free from this second spiritual barrenness.

5\. 'And further, O Bhikkhus, when a brother has doubt in the Brotherhood (Sangha), is uncertain about it, has no confidence in it, has no faith in it; then is his mind not inclined towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle.

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not become free from this third spiritual barrenness.

6\. 'And further, O Bhikkhus, when a brother has doubt in the System of Self-culture (Sikkhâ), is uncertain about it, has no confidence in it, has no faith in it; then is his mind not inclined towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle.

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not become free from this fourth spiritual barrenness.

7\. 'And further, O Bhikkhus, when a brother is angry with his fellow-disciples, discontented with <span id="p225">[<sup><small>p. 225</small></sup>]</span> them, excited against them, barren towards them, the mind of the brother, O Bhikkhus, thus angry with his fellow-disciples, discontented with them, excited against them, barren towards them does not incline towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle.

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not towards zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not become free from this fifth spiritual barrenness.

‘It is such a one, O Bhikkhus, who is not free from the five kinds of spiritual barrenness.’

8\. ‘And who has not broken through the five kinds of spiritual bondage?’

‘In the first place, O Bhikkhus, when a brother has not got rid of the passion for lusts (kâme), has not got rid of the desire after lusts, has not got rid of the attraction to lusts, has not got rid of the thirst for lusts, has not got rid of the fever of lust, has not got rid of the craving after lusts.—

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not toward zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not broken through this first spiritual bondage.

9\. 'And further, O Bhikkhus, when a brother has not got rid of the passion for a body[^4] (kâye), <span id="p226">[<sup><small>p. 226</small></sup>]</span> has not got rid of the desire after a body, has not got rid of the attraction to a body, has not got rid of the thirst for a body, has not got rid of the fever of a body, has not got rid of the craving after a body.—

10\. 'And further, O Bhikkhus, when a brother has not got rid of the passion for a form (rûpe), has not got rid of the desire after a form, has not got rid of the attraction to a form, has not got rid of the thirst for a form, has not got rid of the fever of a form, has not got rid of the craving after a form.—[^5]

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not toward zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not broken through this third spiritual bondage.

<span id="p227">[<sup><small>p. 227</small></sup>]</span>

11\. ’And further, O Bhikkhus, a brother may have eaten enough and to satiety, and begins to follow after the case of sleep, the ease of softness, the ease of sloth.

‘Whatsoever brother, O Bhikkhus, when he has eaten enough and to satiety, begins to follow after the ease of sleep, the ease of softness, the ease of sloth, his mind does not incline to zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle.

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not toward zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not broken through this fourth spiritual bondage.

12\. ‘And further, O Bhikkhus, a brother may have adopted the religious life in the aspiration of belonging to some one or other of the angel hosts’, and thinking to himself: “By this morality, or by this observance, or by this austerity, or by this religious life, I shall become an angel, or one of the angels!”—

‘Whatsoever brother, O Bhikkhus, may have adopted the religious life in the aspiration of belonging to some one or other of the angel hosts, and thinking to himself: “By this morality, or by this observance, or by this austerity, or by this religious life, I shall become an angel, or one of the angels!” his mind does not incline to zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle.

‘But whosesoever mind inclineth not toward zeal, exertion, perseverance, and struggle, he has not broken through this fifth spiritual bondage.

‘It is such a one, O Bhikkhus, who has not broken through the five kinds of mental bondage.

13\. 'And whatsoever brother, O Bhikkhus, has not quite become free from the five kinds of spiritual barrenness, has not altogether broken through the five kinds of mental bondage—that such a one should reach up to the full advantage of, should attain to the full growth in, to full breadth in, this doctrine and discipline—that can in no wise be!

26\. ‘He practises the (first) road to saintship’, which is accompanied by the union of the will to acquire it with earnest contemplation, and with the struggle against sin. He practises the (second) road to saintship, which is accompanied by the union of exertion with earnest contemplation, and with the struggle against sin. He practises the (third) road to saintship, which is accompanied by the union of thought with earnest contemplation, and with the struggle against sin. He practises the (fourth) road to saintship, which is accompanied by the union of investigation with earnest contemplation <span id="p233">[<sup><small>p. 233</small></sup>]</span> and the struggle against sin[^8],—and strong determination too as a fifth.

27\. 'The brother, O Bhikkhus, thus endowed with fifteenfold determination[^9] becomes destined to come forth into the light, capable of the higher wisdom, sure of attaining to the supreme security[^10].

28\. 'Just, O Bhikkhus, as when a hen has eight or ten or twelve eggs, and the hen has properly brooded over them, properly sat upon them, properly sat herself round them, however much such a wish may arise on her heart as this, “O would that my little chickens should break open the eggshell with the points of their claws, or with their beaks, and come forth into the light in safety!” yet all the while those little chickens are sure to break the egg-shell with the points of their claws, or with their beaks, and to come forth into the light in safety.

29\. ‘Just even so, a brother thus endowed with fifteenfold determination is sure to come forth into the light, sure to reach up to the higher wisdom, sure to attain to the supreme security[^11]!’

<span id="p234">[<sup><small>p. 234</small></sup>]</span>

30\. Thus spake the Blessed One. And those Brethren, delighted in heart, exalted the word of the Blessed One.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Pa<i>ñ</i>ka <i>k</i>etokhilâ.

[^2]: Pa<i>ñ</i>ka <i>k</i>etaso vinibandhâ.

[^3]: Dhamma-vinaye. On the disputed question as to whether this compound is a Dvanda or not, see Dr. Oldenberg, Mahâ Vagga, p. x. M. Léon Feer (‘Études Bouddhiques,’ p. 203) has taken it as Tatpurusha; and it would be hazardous to say that it is never used as such. Here I think it is a Dvandva.

[^4]: It is possible that kâya may be used here in a technical sense, as the group or aggregate of qualities, apart from form, which go {footnote p. 226} to make up an individual. This paragraph would then correspond to the 7th Sa<i>m</i>yogana.

[^5]: A<i>ññ</i>atara<i>m</i> deva-nikâya<i>m</i>. Compare Mahâparinibbâna Sutta, Chap. I, § 11, Chap. II, § 9.

[^6]: In this section, and in section 11, I have rendered sukha by ease, and not by happiness, as I think the former is always its more exact meaning in such passages.

[^7]: Iddhipâda<i>m</i>. Here Iddhi must be (spiritual) welfare.

[^8]: The text of this section, so far, will be found in Childers's dictionary, sub voce Iddhipâdo.

[^9]: That is, the four Iddhipâdas, and Usso<i>lh</i>i, each multiplied by three.

[^10]: Anuttarassa Yogakkhemassa; that is, Nirvâna. Compare Dhammapada, ver. 23 and p. 180.

[^11]: The tertium quid of the parable is the absolute certainty of the event which will follow on the hen having duly and diligently followed the law of her instinct, even though she, meanwhile, in her ignorance, be full of doubt and desire. The certainty of the delivery of a woman with child is not unfrequently used as a symbol of what can be absolutely depended upon. So of ‘the word of the glorious Buddhas,’ which endureth for ever, in ‘Buddhist Birth Stories,’ p. 18. I have attempted to imitate the play in the text upon the two words for the ‘coming forth into the light,’ {footnote p. 235} figuratively and literally, of the disciple and of the little chicken. The first is in Pâli bhabbo abhinibbidâya (from vid), the latter is aho vata ... sotthinâ abhinibbhi<i>gg</i>eyyan (from bhid). On sammâ-paribhavitâni, here applied to the a<i>nd</i>âni, see above, Mahâparinibbâna Sutta, Chap. I, § 12, note.
