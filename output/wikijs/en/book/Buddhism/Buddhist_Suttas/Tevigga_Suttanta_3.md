### CHAPTER III.

1\. [^1] 'And he lets his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of Love, and so the second, and so the third, and so the fourth. And thus the whole wide world, above, below, around, and everywhere, does he continue to pervade with heart of Love, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure.

2\. 'Just, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, as a mighty trumpeter makes himself heard—and that without difficulty—in all the four directions; even so of all things that have shape or life, there is not one that he passes by or leaves aside, but regards them all with mind set free, and deep-felt love.

‘Verily this, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, is the way to a state of union with Brahmâ.

3\. 'And he lets his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of pity, sympathy, and equanimity, and so the second, and so the third, and so the fourth. And thus the whole wide world, above, below, around, and everywhere, does he continue to pervade with heart of pity, sympathy, and equanimity, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure.

4\. 'Just, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, as a mighty trumpeter makes himself heard—and that without difficulty—in all the four directions; even so of all things that have

[^1]: This paragraph occurs frequently; see, inter alia, below, Mahâ-Sudassana Sutta II, 8. It will be seen from ‘Buddhism,’ p<span id="p170">[<sup><small>p. 170</small></sup>]</span>, 171, that these meditations play a great part in later Buddhism, and occupy very much the place that prayer takes in Christianity. A fifth, the meditation on Impurity, has been added, at what time I do not know, before the last. All five are practised in Siam (Alabaster, ‘Wheel of the Law,’ <span id="p168">[<sup><small>p. 168</small></sup>]</span>).\] <span id="p202">[<sup><small>p. 202</small></sup>]</span> hape or life, there is not one that he passes by or leaves aside, but regards them all with mind set free, and deep-felt pity, sympathy, and equanimity.

‘Verily this, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, is the way to a state of union with Brahmâ.’

5\. ‘Now what think you, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, will the Bhikkhu[^1] who lives thus be in possession of women and of wealth, or will he not?’

‘He will not, Gotama!’

‘Will he be full of anger, or free from anger?’

‘He will be free from anger, Gotama!’

‘Will his mind be full of malice, or free from malice?’

‘Free from malice, Gotama!’

‘Will his mind be sinful, or pure?’

‘It will be pure, Gotama!’

‘Will he have self-mastery, or will he not?’

‘Surely he will, Gotama!’

6\. ‘Then you say, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, that the Bhikkhu is free from household cares, and that Brahmâ is free from household cares. Is there then agreement and likeness between the Bhikkhu and Brahmâ?’

‘There is, Gotama!’

7\. 'Very good, Vâse<i>tth</i>a. Then in sooth, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, that the Bhikkhu who is free from household cares should after death, when the body is dissolved, become united with Brahmâ, who is the same—such a condition of things is every way possible!

8\. 'And so you say, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, that the Bhikkhu is free from anger, and free from malice, pure in mind, and master of himself; and that Brahmâ is

[^1]: Or ‘Member of our Order.’ See the note on Mahâparinibbâna Sutta I, 6.\] <span id="p203">[<sup><small>p. 203</small></sup>]</span> ree from anger, and free from malice, pure in mind, and master of himself. Then in sooth, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, that the Bhikkhu who is free from anger, free from malice, pure in mind, and master of himself should after death, when the body is dissolved, become united with Brahmâ, who is the same-such a condition of things is every way possible!’

9\. When he had thus spoken, the young Brahmans Vâse<i>tth</i>a and Bhâradvâga addressed the Blessed One, and said:

‘Most excellent, Lord, are the words of thy mouth, most excellent! just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into the darkness, so that those who have eyes can see external forms;—just even so, Lord, has the truth been made known to us, in many a figure, by the Blessed One. And we, even we, betake ourselves, Lord, to the Blessed One as our refuge, to the Truth, and to the Brotherhood. May the Blessed One accept us as disciples, as true believers, from this day forth, as long as life endures!’
