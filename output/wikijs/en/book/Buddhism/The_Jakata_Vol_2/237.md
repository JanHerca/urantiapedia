“_Why are hearts cold_,” _etc_.—This story the Master told during a stay near Sāketa, about a brahmin named Sāketa. Both the circumstances that suggested the story and the story itself have already been given in the First Book [^133].

\[235\]...And when the Tathāgata had gone to the monastery, the Brother asked, “How, Sir, did the love begin? ”and repeated the first stanza:—

Why are hearts cold to one—O Buddha, tell!—
And love another so exceeding well?”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Master explained the nature of love by the second stanza:

“Those love they who in other lives were dear,
As sure as grows the lotus in the mere.”

After this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth:—“These two people were the brahmin and his wife in the story; and I was their son.”
