BEFORE he died, the Blessed One decided to go on a long journey. He wanted to visit certain of his disciples and exhort them to observe his teachings with scrupulous care. With only Ananda for a companion, he left the city of Rajagriha.

One day, while he was resting in the corner of a field, he said to Ananda:

“There will come a time when men will wonder why I once entered a woman's womb. They will question the perfect purity of my birth, and they will doubt whether I ever had supreme power. These benighted men will never understand that, for him who devotes his life to works of holiness, the body is free from the impurity of birth. He who would seek supreme knowledge must enter a woman's womb; he must, out of pity for mankind, be born into the world of men. For if he were a God, how could he set in motion the wheel of the law? Imagine the Buddha as a God, Ananda; men would soon lose heart. They would say, ‘The Buddha, who is a God, has happiness, holiness, perfection; but we, how can we hope to attain them?’ <span id="p274">[<sup><small>p. 274</small></sup>]</span> And they would be in deep despair. Oh, let them keep still, these benighted creatures! Let them not try to steal the law, for they would use it ill. Rather, let them consider the Buddha's nature incomprehensible, these men who will never be able to gauge my eminence!”

A shepherd was crossing the field. He had the serenity of a man who is quietly performing a labor of joy.

“Who are you, shepherd?” the Master asked him.

“My name is Dhaniya,” replied the shepherd.

“Where are you going?” asked the Master.

“I am going home to my wife and children.”

“You seem to know pure happiness, shepherd?”

“I have boiled my rice, I have milked my cows,” said the shepherd Dhaniya; "I live with my family on the banks of the river; my house is well roofed, my fire is lighted; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.

“I am rid of anger, I am rid of stubbornness,” said the Master; “I bide for a night on the banks of the river; my house has no roof, the fire of passions is quenched in my being; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

“The gadflies never torment my herd,” said the shepherd Dhaniya; “my cows roam in the grassy meadows; they can abide the coming rain; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

<span id="p275">[<sup><small>p. 275</small></sup>]</span>

“I built a sturdy raft, I set sail for nirvana,” said the Master; “I crossed the torrent of passions and I reached the saintly shores; I need the raft no longer; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

“My wife is obedient, she is chaste and good,” said the shepherd Dhaniya; “she has lived with me these many years; she is pleasant and kindly, no one speaks ill of her; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

“My mind is obedient, it is loosed from all bonds,” said the Master; “I have trained it these many years; it is quite docile, no evil is left in me; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

“I myself pay my servants their wages,” said the shepherd Dhaniya; “my children receive wholesome food at my board; no one has ever tried to speak ill of them; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

“I am the servant of no one,” said the Master; “with what I earn I travel the whole world; there is for me no need of a servant; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

“I have cows, I have calves, I have heifers,” said the shepherd Dhaniya, "and I have a dog that is lord of my herd; so fall if you will, O rain of the s y.

“I have neither cows nor calves nor heifers,” <span id="p276">[<sup><small>p. 276</small></sup>]</span> said the Master, “and I have no dog to be on guard; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

“The stakes are driven deep in the ground, nothing can move them,” said the shepherd Dhaniya; the ropes are new and made of strong grasses; the cows will never break them now; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

“Like the dog that has broken his chain,” said the Master, “like the elephant that has broken his shackles, never again will I enter a womb; so fall if you will, O rain of the sky.”

The shepherd Dhaniya bowed before the Master and said:

“I know now who you are, O Blessed One; come with me to my home.”

As they were about to enter the house, the rain fell in torrents and formed little streams that trickled over the ground. When Dhaniya heard the rain, he spoke these words:

“Verily, we have acquired great riches since we have seen the Buddha. O Master, you are our refuge, you who have looked at us with the eyes of wisdom. Be our protector, O Saint! We are obedient, my wife and I; if we lead a life of holiness, we shall conquer birth and death, and we shall have done with suffering.”

Then a voice was heard, and Mara, the Evil One, <span id="p277">[<sup><small>p. 277</small></sup>]</span> stood before them. No one had seen him come.

“He who has sons is happy to see his sons,” said Mara, the Evil One; “he who has cows is happy to see his cows; happy is the man of substance, and he who has no substance has no happiness.”

“He who has sons is worried to see his sons,” said the Master; “he who has cows is worried to see his cows; worried is the man of substance, and he who has no substance has no worries.”

But Mara had fled. Dhaniya and his wife were listening to the Master speak.
