THE number of believers was constantly increasing, and King Vimbasara gave repeated evidence to the Master of his faith and friendship. He often invited him to the palace and offered him a seat at his table, and at such times he would order the city to have a festive appearance. The streets were carpeted with flowers, and the houses decorated with banners. The sweetest perfumes filled the air, and the inhabitants dressed in their brightest clothes. The king himself would come forward to greet the Blessed One and would shade him from the sun with his golden parasol.

Many young nobles put all their faith in the law taught by the Blessed One. They wanted to become saints; they abandoned family and fortune, and the Bamboo Grove was soon filled with devout disciples.

But there were many in Rajagriha who were disturbed to see the great number of converts the Buddha was making, and they went about the city, voicing their anger.

<span id="p145">[<sup><small>p. 145</small></sup>]</span>

“Why has he settled in our midst, this son of the Sakyas?” they would ask. “Were there not enough monks already, preaching to us about virtue? And they did not lure our young men away like this master. Why, even our children are leaving us. Because of this son of the Sakyas, how many women are widows! Because of this son of the Sakyas, how many families are childless! Evil will befall the kingdom, now that this monk has settled in our midst!”

The Master soon had a great many enemies among the inhabitants of the city. Whenever they met his disciples, they would taunt them or make sarcastic remarks.

“The great monk came to the city of Rajagriha and conquered the Bamboo Grove; will he now conquer the entire kingdom of Magadha?” said one as he went by.

“The great monk came to the city of Rajagriha and took Sanjaya's disciples away from him; who will he lure away to-day?” said another.

“A plague would be less harmful than this great monk,” said a third; “it would kill fewer children.”

“And it would leave fewer widows,” a woman sighed.

The disciples made no reply. But they felt the anger of the populace growing, and they told the <span id="p146">[<sup><small>p. 146</small></sup>]</span> Master of the evil words they had heard.

“Do not let it disturb you, O disciples,” replied the Buddha. “They will soon stop. To those who follow you with jeers and insults, speak quiet, gentle words. Say to them, ‘It is because they know the truth, the real truth, that the heroes convince, that the perfect ones convert. Who dares offend the Buddha, the Saint who converts by the power of truth?’ Then they will be silent, and in a few days, when you wander through the city, you will meet only with respect and praise.”

It happened as the Buddha had said. The evil voices were silenced, and every one in Rajagriha did honor to the Master's disciples.
