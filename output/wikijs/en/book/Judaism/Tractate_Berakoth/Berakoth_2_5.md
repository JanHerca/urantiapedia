## The Posture and Attention in Prayer.

**M**.V. 1. Men stand [^218] not to pray save with solemnity. [^219] The pious of former time used to wait for one hour and then pray, so that they might direct their intention upon God. [^220] Should the King [^221] salute him, let him not return the

<span id="p36">[<sup><small>p. 36</small></sup>]</span>

**M**.salutation. And should even a snake [^222] twist round his heel, he should not make a pause.

**T**. III. 4. Ben Azzai says: Everyone whose body suffers because of his learning [^223]—it is a favourable sign for him; if his learning because of his body, it is a bad sign for him. Everyone whose mind is disordered because of his learning it is a favourable sign for him; and everyone whose learning is disordered because of his mind, [^224] it is a bad sign for him. He that prayeth must direct his intention to it. Abba Saul [^225] says, The _Memoria technica_ [^226] for the Prayer is, “_When Thou directest their heart, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to hear_.” [^227]

5\. R. Judah said: When R. Aqiba was praying with the congregation he used to shorten \[his prayers, hurrying\] in front of them all; when he was praying quite alone, if a man left him on this side (of the room) he would come and find him on the other side, because of the bowings and prostrations that he used to make. [^228]

6\. Perhaps a man should pray the whole day long? He has clearly said in the case of Daniel: “three times a day was he kneeling upon his knees,” [^229] etc. Perhaps \[this was\] from the time that he came into Captivity? It is expressly said: “as he did aforetime.” Perhaps one should say it loud enough for oneself to hear? He has clearly said in <span id="p37">[<sup><small>p. 37</small></sup>]</span> the case of Hannah: “_Now Hannah, she was speaking in her heart_, [^230] etc. Perhaps we should include them all (the Eighteen) at one sitting? He has expressly stated in the case of David: ”_Evening, and morning, and noonday_,“ [^231] etc. ”Evening “that is, evening prayer; ”morning“—that is, morning prayer; ”noonday“—that is afternoon prayer (Minchah). Perhaps one should ask for what one needs and then depart (without saying the Benediction)? He has expressly stated in the case of Solomon: ”_to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer_“ [^232] ”cry“—that is chanting (in praise), and so he says: ”_Cry aloud, ye righteous, in the LORD_,“ [^233] etc. We do not say anything after ”True and sure," [^234] but we do say things after the Prayer, even though it be the Order of Confession of the Day of Atonement. [^235]

14\. A blind man, and whoever is not able to determine the direction in which he faces, direct their intentions to God [^236] and pray; for it is said: “_and they shall pray towards the LORD_.” [^237]

15\. They who stand \[praying\] outside the \[Holy\] Land set their intention opposite the land of Israel, and pray; for it is said: “_and they pray towards the LORD in the direction of their land_ [^238] _which Thou hast chosen_.” They who stand in the land of Israel set their intention opposite Jerusalem and pray; for it is said: “_and they pray towards this city_.” [^239]

16\. They who stand in Jerusalem set their intention opposite the Sanctuary, and pray; for it is said: “_and they pray towards this place_.” [^240] a If they find themselves standing on the north \[of the <span id="p38">[<sup><small>p. 38</small></sup>]</span> temple\] their faces should be towards the south, if standing on the south their faces should be towards the north, if standing on the east their faces should be towards the west, if standing on the west their faces should be towards the east, and so all Israel find themselves praying to one place.

17\. A man may not stand upon a bed, nor upon a seat, nor upon a bench, and pray, for there may be no high position before God; [^241] for it is said: “_Out of the depths have cried unto thee, O LORD_.” [^242] if he is old, or ill, behold, then it is permissible. [^243]

20\. Suppose a man is standing and praying in a camp [^244] or in an open highway, behold, he avoids an ass or an ass-driver or a seller of pots; [^245] he does not pause \[in his prayer\]. They say concerning R. Chanina ben Dosa, that he was standing and praying, and an _‘arod_ [^246] bit him, and he made no pause. His disciples went and found it dead on the mouth of its hole. They said: Woe to the man whom an _‘arod_ has bitten; \[but\] woe to the _‘arod_ which bit ben Dosa.

21\. We do not stand up to pray straightway from conversation, nor from laughter, nor from frivolity, nor from idle talk, but (we do) from learned discourse.

And so a man should not take leave of his companion straightway from conversation, nor from laughter, nor from idle talk, nor from frivolity, but from learned discourse. For so we find in the <span id="p39">[<sup><small>p. 39</small></sup>]</span> case of the prophets of old [^247] that they closed their words with words of praise and supplications. [^248]

<a id="m2"></a>

## The Mention of, and the Petition for, Rain, also the Habdalah, in the Prayer.

**M**.V. 2. They make mention of [^249] the powers of the M. rains [^250] in the \[Benediction of\] the resurrection of the dead, [^251] and they ask for rains in the Benediction of the years [^252] and \[they add\] the _Habdalah_ [^253] in “Thou that graciously givest knowledge.” [^254] R. Aqiba used to say: One says it (the Habdalah) as a fourth Benediction by itself. R. Eliezer used to say: With the _Hoda’ah_. [^255]

**T**. III. 9. If he has not made mention of the power of the rains in \[the Benediction of\] the Resurrection of the dead, and has not asked for the rains in the Benediction of the years, he must be turned back.

If he has not said the Habdalah at “Thou that graciously givest knowledge,” he says it over the <span id="p40">[<sup><small>p. 40</small></sup>]</span> cup. [1](Berakoth_2_5#fn_256) If he has not said it \[there\] he must be turned back.

R. Jose said: Also he who has not made mention of \[the covenant\] in the thanksgiving for the land [2](Berakoth_2_5#fn_257) must be turned back.

<a id="m3"></a>

## Three Examples of Benedictions at Wrong Times. On Mistakes made by the Leader.

**M**.V. 3. He that saith: “Over a bird's nest [^258] do Thy mercies extend,” and “For good let Thy name be remembered,” [^259] and “We praise, we praise,” [^260] must be stopped. As for him that passes before the Ark [^261] and makes a mistake let another pass in his stead. Let him not decline \[when asked to say prayers at that time\]. Where does he begin? At the beginning of the Benediction in which he \[the former\] made the mistake.

<span id="p41">[<sup><small>p. 41</small></sup>]</span>

**M**.4\. He [1](Berakoth_2_5#fn_262) that passes before the Ark must not answer Amen after the priests [2](Berakoth_2_5#fn_263) \[for fear of\] distraction. If no priest is there he must not lift up his hands \[to bless\]. But if he has confidence that if he lifts up his hands [3](Berakoth_2_5#fn_264) \[to bless\] he can return to his prayer, he is permitted to do so.

### On Mistakes (_continued_). R. Chanina's Knowledge of the Effect of His Prayers.

5\. He who is praying and makes a mistake—it is a bad omen for him. And if he is the representative of the congregation [^265] it is a bad omen for those that bid him represent them, because a man's representative is like himself. [^266] They tell of R. Chanina b. Dosa that he used to pray over the sick and say: This one will live, and this one will die. They said to him: Whence knowest thou \[this\]? He said to them: If my prayer is fluent [^267] in my mouth I know that he \[the sick

<span id="p42">[<sup><small>p. 42</small></sup>]</span>

**M**.man\] is accepted, and if not I know that he is rejected.

## Footnotes

[^216]: 35:1 _ten Benedictions_. The first three and last three of the Eighteen, three for New Year's Day (SA, pp. 241 _sq_.), and one for the sabbath (see Laible).

[^217]: 35:2 _nine_ \[(_Benedictions_)\]. Not adding a special Benediction about the sabbath.

[^218]: 35:3 SA, p. 238.

[^219]: 35:4 _stand_. i.e. to say the Eighteen (_cf_. pp. [4](Berakoth_1_1#p4) _sq_.).

[^220]: 35:5 _with solemnity_. The phrase is literally “with heaviness of head,” _i.e._ with bending it down, but probably the expression is here solely metaphorical, in contrast to “lightness of head,” _i.e._ irreverence, _cf_. _T_. III. 21 ([p. 38](#p38)). It is not far removed from the phrase “the poor in spirit” (Matt 53).

[^221]: 35:6 _God_. Lit.: the Place ([p. 29](Berakoth_2_4#p29)). B has “their Father who is in heaven.”

[^222]: 35:7 _the King_. An Israelite, for to a heathen king one must answer, for fear of the consequences (Bartenora).

[^223]: 36:1 _a snake_. An ordinary one, which does not generally bite. But in the case of a viper or a scorpion, which certainly bite and kill, he should pause (Bartenora).

[^224]: 36:2 _learning_. Lit.: “wisdom,” and so throughout this section.

[^225]: 36:3 _mind_. _da‘ath_, perhaps constitution.

[^226]: 36:4 _Abba Saul_. Of the third generation of mishna teachers, c. 130-160 A.D.

[^227]: 36:5 _memories technica_. Lit.: “sign.”

[^228]: 36:6 Ps. 1017.

[^229]: 36:7 The section shows the earnestness with which the great teacher prayed.

[^230]: 36:8 Dan. 610. The phrases in the case of Daniel, Hannah, David, Solomon are literally “in Daniel,” etc., and possibly are of the same type as on [p. 79](Berakoth_3_9#p79).

[^231]: 37:1 1 Sam. 113.

[^232]: 37:2 Ps. 5517.

[^233]: 37:3 1 Kings 828.

[^234]: 37:4 Ps. 331.

[^235]: 37:5 “True and sure” (_’Emeth wyatzib_), _cf_. [p. 7](Berakoth_1_1#p7).

[^236]: 37:6 After the Prayer (_Tephillah_) serious variations may begin, exclusive of minor variations in the _Tephillah_ itself.

[^237]: 37:7 _God_. Lit.: “the Place.”

[^238]: 37:8 1 Kings 844.

[^239]: 37:9 _their land_. Not verbally in 1 Kings 844.

[^240]: 37:10 Again, not verbally correct.

[^241]: 37:11 _this place_. This also is not verbally exact.

[^242]: 38:1 = the Place, and so, often.

[^243]: 38:2 Ps. 1301.

[^244]: 38:3 On this section see “_The Hebrew-Christian Messiah_,” p. 237.

[^245]: 38:4 _camp_. στρατεία.

[^246]: 38:5 _a seller of pots_ (_qaddar_). But Kahan's emendation in Laible to _qarrar_, or rather _qârār_ (waggoner) may be accepted.

[^247]: 38:6 _an_ ‘arod. Usually a wild ass, but here evidently a species of venomous snake. The story comes also in T. J. V. 1. (p. 9a), but rather differently in _T_. B. 33a.

[^248]: 39:1 _the prophets of old_. Literally “the former prophets,” but this technical term for the Books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings can hardly be intended here.

[^249]: 39:2 For the principle compare the direction of the Massoretes to repeat Isa. 6623 after ver. 24.

[^250]: 39:3 _make mention of_. In contrast to direct petition, see note 5.

[^251]: 39:4 _the powers of the rains_. So literally, but the phrase connotes the manifestations of the Divine power in sending rain.

[^252]: 39:5 _the resurrection of the dead_. The words “Thou causest the wind to blow and the rain to fall” are inserted in the second Benediction of the Eighteen during the winter months (SA, P. 44).

[^253]: 39:6 _the years_. The petition for rain is used in the ninth Benediction from Dec. 4 to the first day of Passover (SA, p. 47).

[^254]: 39:7 _the Habdalah_. A short Benediction at the conclusion of sabbath. See Staerk, p. 26; _cf_. SA, pp. 216 _sq_., _Jewish Encyclopedia_, vi. pp. 118-121.

[^255]: 39:8 _knowledge_. The fourth Benediction (SA, p. 46).

[^256]: 39:9 _the Hoda’ah_, [p. 34](Berakoth_2_4#p34) note.

[^257]: 40:1 _the cup_. At the end of the sabbath, SA, p. 216.

[^258]: 40:2 _the thanksgiving for the lan_d. In the Benediction after the meal, SA, p. 280. The Erfurt text is ungrammatical, but the Vienna and the ordinary text read “who has not made mention of the covenant in the Benediction for the land.” The covenant is “that which Thou hast sealed in our flesh.”

[^259]: 40:3 _Over a bird's nest_. Deut. 227. The prayer would continue “and therefore have mercy upon us.” But this implies that Deut. 227 was recorded to exhibit God's mercy. It was not so. For otherwise God would not allow birds and beasts to be killed. That passage is to be accepted as God's decree, without our making use of it for such a purpose (_Tosaphoth Yom Tob_). It is possible, as the following cases are connected with heretical opinions, that the remembrance of Matt. 1029 may also have had some influence.

[^260]: 40:4 _For good, etc_. It seems to deny that evil is permitted by God as well as good.

[^261]: 40:5 _We praise, we praise_. Twice over. The speaker may be referring to more than one divine principle (_cf_. the next mishna and _M_. IX. 8 (5), [p. 87](Berakoth_3_9#p87), and the common argument for the Trinity from the threefold use of “Holy” in Isa. vi. 3).

[^262]: 40:6 _him passes before the Ark_. [p. 19](Berakoth_1_2#p19) note. It was correct for him who was invited to lead the Tephillah to decline the first time, but to yield to a second and third invitation (Gemara _T_. B. 34a).

[^263]: 41:1 B prefixes: “He that says, Let the good say the Benediction, lo, this smacks of heresy (_minûth_),” as suggesting the division of members into worthy and unworthy. But it would not appear to have any connexion with Christianity.

[^264]: 41:2 _after the priests_. The blessing from Num. 624-26 was given by the priests between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Benedictions (SA, p. 53). If the leader said “Amen” he was in danger of forgetting the last Benediction. The priests face the people, and the leader faces the priests and says the blessings word for word for them to repeat. To each of the three blessings the people say Amen. See Maimonides.

[^265]: 41:3 _his hands_. Literally “his palms,” perhaps the palms of the hands were held up towards the congregation.

[^266]: 41:4 _the representative of the congregation_ (_shliach tsibbur_). In his duties for the occasion; it was not a permanent office (Elbogen, p. 488).

[^267]: 41:5 _like himself_. Cf. Matt. 1040. See my _Manual of Christian Evidences for Jewish People_, §§ 339 _sq_.
