## Reverence in Writing the Name.

**T**. III. 22. He who is writing the name \[of the LORD\] may not return a man's salutation even if it be that of a king. If he is writing five or six such names, when he has finished one of them he returns the salutation.

## The Benediction of Mourners.

23\. In a place where they are accustomed to say the Benediction of Mourners as three prayers, [^268] we say three; where as two, we say two; where as one, we say one.

24\. In a place where they are accustomed to say the Benediction of mourners as three prayers, a man combines the first with that about the Resurrection of the Dead and seals it with “Thou that quickenest the dead.” \[He combines\] the second with “the consolation of the mourners” and seals it with “He that consoleth His people and His city.” \[He combines\] the third with “the restitution of kindnesses,” but does not seal it. He that dismisses the congregation in the cemetery has no need to seal.

## On Certain Points in the Eighteen.

25\. The Eighteen Benedictions which the Majority have ordered, correspond to the eighteen times that the LORD is mentioned in the Psalm beginning “_Give to the LORD, O ye sons of the mighty_.” [^269] One combines \[the Benediction about\] the _Minim_ [^270] with <span id="p43"><sup><small>[ p. 43 ]</small></sup></span> that about the Pharisees, [1](../Berakoth_3_6#fn_271) and that about the Proselytes with that about the Elders, [2](../Berakoth_3_6#fn_272) and that about David with that about Jerusalem. [3](../Berakoth_3_6#fn_273) If men have said each of these by themselves, their obligation is fulfilled. [^271]

## Footnotes

[^268]: 41:6 _fluent_. Cf. _M_. IV. 3 (p. 31).

[^269]: 42:1 _as three prayer_s. In the house, on the part of visitors after the funeral. SA, pp. 323 _sq_. Cf. _supra_, [p. 21](../Berakoth_1_2#p21).

[^270]: 42:2 Ps. 29.

[^271]: 42:3 _the Minim_. The Palestinian, or “older form of the Twelfth Benediction is, ”To the apostates (_mshummāddim_) let there be no p. 43 hope, and the kingdom of pride do Thou quickly root out in our days. And let the Christians (_notzrim_), and the _minim_, perish as in a moment. Let them be wiped out of the book of life, and with the righteous let them not be written. Blessed art Thou, O LORD, who subdueth the proud." The common, and later, form may be found in SA, p. 48.
