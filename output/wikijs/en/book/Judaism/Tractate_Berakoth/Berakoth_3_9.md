## Benedictions at Scenes of Miracles, or of Past Idolatry.

**M**.IX. I. He who sees a place in which miracles were wrought for Israel [^450] says: “Blessed be He who wrought miracles for our fathers in this place.” In the, case of a place from which idolatry was uprooted, he says: “Blessed be He who uprooted idolatry from our land.”

**T**. VII. 2. He that seeth idolatry says: Blessed be He who is slow to anger. \[He that seeth\] a place from which idolatry was uprooted says: Blessed be He who hath uprooted idolatry from our land; may it be pleasing in Thy sight, O LORD our God, that idolatry be uprooted from our land, and from all places in Israel, and mayest Thou turn the hearts of them that worship idols to worship Thee.

<span id="p75">[<sup><small>p. 75</small></sup>]</span>

**T**.

He that seeth hosts [^451] says: Blessed be He who is wise in all these mysteries, for none of their countenances is alike, nor their knowledge alike. [^452]

Ben Zoma saw hosts in the Temple area. He said: Blessed be He who created all these to serve me. How much did Adam toil, and tasted not one mouthful, until he had ploughed, and sowed, and reaped, and harvested, and threshed, and winnowed, and sifted, and ground, and bolted, and kneaded, and baked, and after that he ate! But I arise at dawn and I find all these things already done for me. How much did Adam toil, and clothed himself with not a single garment until he had shorn, and cleansed, and beaten, and dyed, and spun, and weaved, and sewed, and after that he clothed himself! But I arise at dawn and find all these things already done for me. How many trades (_i.e._ tradesmen) are anxious and rise early! But I arise at dawn and I find all these already done for me.

And so Ben Zoma used to say: “What does a good guest say? Remember the landlord for good! How many kinds of wine hath he brought before us! How many kinds of portions of meat hath he brought before us! How many kinds of fine bread hath he brought before us! All that he did, he did only for my sake. But what does an evil guest say? Well, what have I eaten of his? One bit of bread have I eaten of his; one portion of meat have I eaten of his; one cup have I drunk of his; all that he did, he did only for the sake of his wife and his children. And so it says ”_Remember that thou magnify His work, whereof men have sung_." [^453]

<span id="p76">[<sup><small>p. 76</small></sup>]</span>

<a id="m2"></a>

## At Various Natural Phenomena, and at Good or Bad Tidings.

_M_. IX. 2. At [^454] shooting stars, [^455] and at earthquakes, and at lightnings, and at thunder, and at wind(s), one says: “Blessed be He whose power filleth the world.” At mountains and hills, at seas and rivers and at deserts, he says: “Blessed be the Maker of the works of creation.” R. Judah says: He who sees the Great Sea [^456] says: “Blessed be He who made the Great Sea.” \[This he says\] when he sees it at intervals. [^457] At rains, and at good tidings, he says: “Blessed be the Good and the Doer of good,” and at ill reports he says “Blessed be He who judgeth in truth.”

**T**. VII. 1. The Benediction in the invitation [^458] is derived from the Law, for it is said: “_And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless_” [^459]—this is the Benediction in the invitation; “_the LORD thy God_”—this is the first Benediction; “_for the. . . land_”—this is the Benediction for the land; “_good_” this is \[the Benediction for\] Jerusalem; and so it says: “_this goodly mountain, and Lebanon_.” [^460] “_Which he hath given thee_,” [^461]—this is \[the Benediction\] “who art Good and doest good.” Whence do we learn that just as thou blessest Him after it (_i.e._ the meal), so thou blessest Him before it? It is expressly said: “_which he gave thee_,” _i.e._ from the <span id="p77">[<sup><small>p. 77</small></sup>]</span> time that He is giving it thee and whence \[do we learn that we bless Him\] even for the mountains and for the hills? [^462] It is expressly said: “_for the land_.” Whence even for the Law and even for the commandments? It is expressly said: “_Who gave thee_,” and in another place he says: “_And I will give thee the tables of stone_.” [^463] R. Meir says: Whence \[do we learn that\] just as thou sayest a Benediction over what is good, so thou sayest a Benediction over what is evil. It is expressly said: “_Which the LORD thy God gave thee_,” [^464]—“thy God” means “thy Judge,” in every judgment which He adjudges thee, whether for good or for punishment.

3\. He who sees a negro, or a man with red spots, or one with white spots, or a humpback, or a dwarf, says: “Blessed be He who makes creatures different.” \[He who sees\] one who has lost a limb, or a lame man, or a blind man, or one afflicted with boils, says: “Blessed be He that judgeth in truth.”

4\. If one sees beautiful persons and beautiful trees he says: “Blessed be He who has beautiful creatures thus in His world.” [^465]

5\. He who sees the bow in the cloud says: “Blessed be He who is faithful in His. covenant, remembering the covenant.” [^466]

6\. If one walks in a burial-ground one says: “Blessed be He who knows the number of you all; He will judge you; He will raise you up; Blessed be He who is faithful in His word, restoring the dead to life.”

He who sees the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the planets, says: “Blessed be He who maketh the things of Creation.” R. Judah says: <span id="p78">[<sup><small>p. 78</small></sup>]</span> He who says a Benediction over the sun—lo, this is another way. [^467] And so R. Judah used to say: “He who seeth the sea continually, and any change takes place in it, must say a Benediction.” [^468]

<a id="m3"></a>

## On Other Occasions.

**M**.. IX. 3. If a man has built a new house, or bought new tools, [^469] he says: “Blessed be He who has allowed us to reach this time.” [^470]

<a id="m4"></a>

## Parenthesis:—Prayers in Vain.

4\. (3 _cont_.). One utters over evil the abstract for good, and over good the abstract [^471] for evil [^472] He that calleth out for what is already past—lo, this is a prayer in vain.

5\. (3 _cont_.). How so? If his wife is with child and he says: “May it be Thy pleasure that my wife bears a male child”—lo, this is a prayer in vain. [^473] Or if he is on a journey, and hears shrieks in the city, and says: “May it be Thy pleasure that these be not in my house”—lo, this is a prayer in vain. [^474]

<span id="p79">[<sup><small>p. 79</small></sup>]</span>

**T**.

T. VII. 7. R. Meir used to say: Behold, it says, “_And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart_,” [^475] etc.—with thy two natures, with thy good nature and with thy evil nature. “_With all thy soul_,”—even when He takes away thy soul. Another explanation is: “With all thy soul,” with [^476] the soul which He created in thee, for it is said: “_Let my soul live, and it shall praise Thee_.” [^477] And it says: “_All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto Thee?_” [^478] Ben Azzai says: “With all thy soul,”—Give thy soul to His commandments. There are words which are foolish prayers. [^479] How so? A man gathers a hundred _kors_, [^480] and says, May it be Thy good pleasure that they be two hundred. A man collects a hundred flasks [^481] and says: May it be Thy good pleasure that they be two hundred. Behold this is a prayer in vain. But he ought to pray that a blessing be gathered with them, and not a curse.

8\. R. Dosethai bar Jannai, [^482] says in the name of R. Meir: Behold, He saith in \[the passage about\] Isaac: [^483] “_And I will bless thee, and will multiply thy seed_.” [^484] Isaac expounded the words and said: Seeing that no blessing rests on one save by the work of one's hands—he arose and sowed. [^485] For <span id="p80">[<sup><small>p. 80</small></sup>]</span> it is said: “_And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in that year a hundred measures_,” etc., and a hundred quantities. [^486] A hundred measures, for they measured them a hundred times, for each one there was a hundred in what they measured. [^487]

9\. He who performs any commandment must say a Benediction. He who makes himself a _sukkah_ [^488] says: “Blessed be He who enabled us to reach this season.” [^489] When he enters in to dwell in it he says: “Blessed be He who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us to dwell in a _sukkah_.” And when he has said the Benediction over it on the first day, he need not say the Benediction again.

10\. He that makes himself a _Lulab_ [^490] says: “Blessed be He who brought us to this time,” and when he takes it up he says: “Blessed be He who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us concerning the taking up of the Lulab,” and he must say the Benediction over it, all the seven days (of the Festival).

He that makes for himself _Tsitsith_ [^491] says: “Blessed be He who brought us to this time,” when he wraps himself in (the shawl on which they are) he says: “to wrap oneself in Tsitsith.”

<span id="p81">[<sup><small>p. 81</small></sup>]</span>

**T**.

He that makes for himself _Tephillin_ [^492] says: “Blessed be he who brought us to this time,” and when he lays them [^493] he says: “Who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us to lay _Tephillin_.” When does he begin to lay them? At dawn. If he has not laid them at dawn, he lays them at any time in the day.

11\. He who kills an animal for food [^494] needs a Benediction for himself. He says: “Who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us concerning slaughter.”

He who covers blood needs a Benediction for himself concerning the covering of blood.

12\. He who performs the ceremony of circumcision [^495] needs a Benediction for himself. He says: “Who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us concerning circumcision.”

The father of the boy needs a Benediction for himself: “Blessed be He who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us to make him enter into the covenant of Abraham our father.”

And they that stand by say: “As Thou hast made him enter the covenant, so mayest Thou make him enter the law and the marriage canopy.”

13\. He who says the Benediction [^496] says: "He who sanctified the beloved [^497] from the womb set a statute in his flesh; his offspring did He seal [^498] with the sign of the holy covenant. Therefore in reward for this did the living God, our Portion and our <span id="p82">[<sup><small>p. 82</small></sup>]</span> Rock, give commandment to deliver [^499] the beloved of our race for the sake of His covenant which He set in our flesh. Blessed be He who maketh the covenant!" [^500]

14\. He who makes a journey to separate Contributions [^501] and Tithes says: “Blessed be He who sanctified us to separate Contribution and Tithes.” When does he begin to say the Benediction over them? At the moment that he separates them.

15\. In the case of ten persons who are performing ten religious duties, each single person says a Benediction for himself. If all of them are performing one religious duty, one says the Benediction for them all. A single person who performs ten religious duties says a Benediction over each one. If he is performing one religious duty, the whole day, he says the Benediction only once. If he leaves off and then goes on performing it, he says one over each single time \[that he begins afresh\].

<a id="m6"></a>

## On Praying when Entering and when Leaving a Town.

**M**.IX. 6 (4). He that enters into a town prays two prayers—one on his entrance, and one on his exit. [4](Berakoth_3_9#fn_502) Ben Azzai [^503] says: Four, two on his entrance, and two on his exit. And one gives praise for <span id="p83">[<sup><small>p. 83</small></sup>]</span> what is past, and calleth out for what is about to come. [^504]

**T**.

**T**. VII. 16. He that entereth into a town prays two prayers, one on his entrance and one on his exit. Ben Azzai says, Four; two on his entrance and two on his exit. What does he say on his entrance? “May it be pleasing before Thee, O LORD our God, that Thou wilt cause me to enter this town in peace.” If he has entered in peace he says: “I acknowledge [^505] before Thee that Thou hast caused me to enter in peace. May it be pleasing before Thee, O LORD my God, that Thou wilt bring me out of this town in peace.” If he has gone out in peace he says: “I acknowledge before Thee, O LORD my God, that Thou hast brought me out of this town in peace, and even as Thou hast brought me out in peace so mayest Thou cause me to walk in peace and mayest uphold me in peace until I reach my home in peace.”

17\. He that entereth into a \[public\] bath [^506] prays two prayers, one when he enters and one when he goes out. When he enters he says: "May it be pleasing before Thee, O LORD my God, that Thou wilt cause me to enter in peace, and wilt bring me out in peace And let no mischief happen to me, [^507] and if any mischief happen to me let my death be <span id="p84">[<sup><small>p. 84</small></sup>]</span> an atonement  [^508] for all my iniquities, and deliver Thou me from this and all like it in the future that is to come.“ [^509] If he has gone out in peace he says: ”I acknowledge before Thee, O LORD my God, that Thou hast brought me out in peace. Even so may it be pleasing before Thee, [^510] O LORD my God, that I may come to my home in peace.”

18\. R. Judah says: There are three Benedictions which one must say every day: “Blessed be He who did not make me a Gentile”; “Blessed be He who did not make me a woman”; “Blessed be He who did not make me an uneducated man.” [^511] Blessed be He who did not make me a Gentile—“_All the nations_ (Gentiles) _are as nothing before Him_.” [^512] Blessed be He who did not make me a woman—for a woman is under no obligation to keep the commandments. [^513] Blessed be He who did not make me an uneducated person—for no uneducated person fears sin. [^514]

They say in parables, To what is the matter like? To a king of flesh and blood who told his servant to boil him some broth, though he had never boiled him broth in his life. The result was he burnt the broth and provoked his master. \[He told him\] to make him a fold to his shirt, though he had never made him a fold to a shirt in his life.

<span id="p85">[<sup><small>p. 85</small></sup>]</span>

The result was that he soiled the shirt, and _T_. provoked his master. [^515]

<a id="m7"></a>

## On Saying a Benediction for Evil: Deut. 6:5 expounded.

**M**.IX. 7 (5a). A man is under “obligation to say a Benediction for evil just as he does for good. For it is said: ”_And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all Mine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might_.“ [^516] ”_With all Mine heart_“— with thy two natures, [^517] with thy good nature and with thy evil nature. ”_And with all thy soul_“—even if He taketh away thy soul (life). ”_And with all thy might_“—with all thy wealth. [^518] Another explanation is: ”_With all thy might_ (_m’odeka_)"—With every single quality (_middah_) that He measures (_môdēd_) out to thee, in all \[ever\] acknowledge (_môdeh_) Him very exceedingly (_bm’ôd m’ôd_). [^519]

<a id="m8a"></a>

## Against Irreverence for the Temple.

8_a_ (5_b_). A man must not behave irreverently when opposite the eastern gate, [^520] for it is set opposite the Most Holy Sanctuary. He must not enter the Temple area with his staff, and his

<span id="p86">[<sup><small>p. 86</small></sup>]</span>

**M**.shoe(s), [1](Berakoth_3_9#fn_521) and with his purse, and with the dust on his feet. [2](Berakoth_3_9#fn_522) Nor should he make it a short cut, [3](Berakoth_3_9#fn_523) much less spit there. What of wearing shoes? For this is out of respect; it is forbidden to enter with them. And spitting? For this comes from contempt. It is the regulation. [4](Berakoth_3_9#fn_524)

**T**.

**T**. VII. 19. A man may not enter the Temple area with money tied up in his linen cloth, [5](Berakoth_3_9#fn_525) or with dust which is on his feet, or with his money-bag tied to him on the outside \[of his dress\]. For it is said: “_Keep thy feet when thou goest to the house of God_.” [6](Berakoth_3_9#fn_526) R. Jose, son of R. Judah, says: Behold, He says: “_For none might enter within the king's gate clothed with sackcloth_.” [7](Berakoth_3_9#fn_527) How many arguments from the less to the greater are there in this case! And so spitting (is forbidden) by the same argument. For as with a shoe, in connexion with which there is no customary contempt, the Law says: [8](Berakoth_3_9#fn_528) Do not enter in—with a shoe, how much less with spitting in which there is customary contempt.

<a id="m8b"></a>

## The Closing Words of the Benedictions.

**M**.IX. 8_b_ (5_c_). All the “seals” [^529] of the Benedictions which were in the Temple were \[_i.e._ were closed <span id="p87">[<sup><small>p. 87</small></sup>]</span> with\] “from ever.” [^530] (But) from the time that the Heretics [^531] spoiled things, and said, “There is no world save one,” they ordered that \[men\] should say: “from ever to ever.” [^532]

**T**. VII. 21. All the “seals” of the Benedictions which were said in the Temple were “to everlasting.” From the time that the Heretics \[_minim_\] spoiled things, and said, There is no world save one, they ordained that men should say, “from everlasting and to everlasting,” and \[so\] acknowledge that this world is when compared to the world to come only like the vestibule in front of the dining-hall. [^533]

22\. They did not answer “Amen” in the Temple. And whence do we know that they did not answer “Amen” in the Temple? Because it is said: “_Stand up and bless the LORD your God from ever to ever_;” [^534] and it says \[then\] “_And let them bless thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise_,” above every single Blessing and above every single \[ascription of\] praise. [^535]

20\. He that openeth \[his Benediction\] with Yôd, Hê, [^536] and closeth [^537] with Yôd, Hê—behold, this is a wise man, \[He that openeth\] with the Aleph but <span id="p88">[<sup><small>p. 88</small></sup>]</span> not with Daleth, [^538] and closeth with Yôd, Hê—behold, this is a middling man. \[He that openeth\] with Yôd, Hê, and closeth with Aleph but not with Daleth—behold, this is an uneducated man. \[He that openeth\] with Aleph but not with Daleth, and closeth with Aleph but not with Daleth—behold, this is another Way \[altogether\]. [^539]

<a id="m8c"></a>

## Salutations in the Name.

**M**.IX. 8_c_ (5_d_). And they ordered that a man should salute his companion in the Name. [^540] For it is said: “_And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The LORD be with you, and they said to him: The LORD bless thee_.” [^541] And it says: “_The LORD be with thee, thou mighty man of valour_.” [^542] And it says: “_Despise not thy mother when she is old_.” [^543]° And it says: “_It is time to work for the LORD; they have made thy law void_.” [^544] R. Nathan says: They break Thy law, at a time when they work for the LORD. [^545]

<span id="p89">[<sup><small>p. 89</small></sup>]</span>

**T**.

**T**. VII. 23. In ancient times when the Law was being forgotten of Israel the elders used to dry-nurse it them, [^546] for it is said: “_And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you_,” [^547] and it says: “_The LORD be with thee, thou mighty man of valour_.” [^548]

24\. Hillel the Elder [^549] says: At a time when men gather do thou scatter, and at a time when men scatter do thou gather. \[That means\] At a time when thou seest that the Law is precious to Israel, and all rejoice in it, do thou be scattering with it. [^550] For it is said: “_There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more_.” [^551] And at a time when thou seest that the Law is forgotten of Israel, and none pay attention to it, do thou be gathering in it. [^552] For it is said: “_It is time to work for the LORD;_ \[when\] _they have made thy law void_.” [^553] R. Meir used to say: “They have made thy law void, therefore it is time for the LORD to work.” [^554]

R. Meir used to say: Thou hast no man in Israel who is not performing a hundred commandments every day. He recites the Shma‘; he says Benedictions before it and after it; he eats his bread, and says a Benediction before it and after it; he prays the Eighteen Benedictions three times, and he does the rest of all the commandments and says Benedictions over them.

25\. And so R. Meir used to say: Thou hast no man in Israel whom the commandments [^555] do not <span id="p90">[<sup><small>p. 90</small></sup>]</span> surround. _Tephillin_ are on his head; and _Tephillin_ on his arm; and a _Mezuzah_ on his door; and four _Tsitsith_ surround him. And concerning them said David: “_With seven a day do I praise thee, because of thy righteous judgments_.” [^556] When he entered into the public bath, circumcision was on his flesh, for it is said: “_For the Chief Musician; set to the Eighth. A Psalm of David_.” [^557] And it says, “_The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them_.” [^558]

## Footnotes

[^455]: 76:1 SA, pp. 291 _sq_., has similar, but not quite identical, forms. Cf. Abrahams’ notes.

[^456]: 76:2 _shooting stars_, or, “comets.”

[^457]: 76:3 _the Great Sea_. The Mediterranean.

[^458]: 76:4 _at intervals_. Cf. _T_. VII. 6 (p. 78). At intervals of thirty days (Bartenora), thus excluding persons who live on the coast.

[^459]: 76:5 _The Benediction in the invitation_. See [p. 59](Berakoth_3_6#p59).

[^460]: 76:6 Deut. 810.

[^461]: 76:7 Deut. 325.

[^462]: 76:8 Deut. 810.

[^463]: 77:1 _for the mountains and for the hills_. _i.e._ on seeing them.

[^464]: 77:2 Exod. 2412.

[^465]: 77:3 _the LORD thy God gave thee_. This is the sense of Deut. 810, but verbally the quotation is found in 2611, where it refers to “good,” and also in 2853, where it refers to punishment.

[^466]: 77:4 The common text has, “who created beautiful creatures.”

[^467]: 77:5 _remembering the covenant_. His faithfulness is seen in His remembering it. The reference is to Gen. 915.

[^468]: 78:1 _another way_. For this common use of “way” in the sense of manner of life ordered by religion, and so religion itself, _cf_. Acts 92, 199-23, 224, 2422, and the all—comprehensive John 146. Even the word Halaka is properly, we may suppose, “method of walk.”

[^469]: 78:2 Cf. [p. 76](#p76).

[^451]: 74:5 _in which miracles were wrought for Israel_, _e.g._ “the fords of the Red Sea, the streams of Arnon, the fords of Jordan, and the stone on which Moses sat when he made war with Amalek, and the like” (Bartenora). These and others are mentioned in the Gemara, _T_.B. 54.

[^452]: 75:1 _hosts_ (ὄχλος). Israelites, Gemara T.B. 58a.

[^453]: 75:2 _alike_. Yet God knows each.

[^454]: 75:3 Job 3624. For God is the landlord, who has provided all,

[^470]: 78:3 _tools_. The word includes vessels and implements of all kinds.

[^471]: 78:4 has, “who has given us life, and has established us, and has allowed us to reach this time.”—A service for the consecration of a house is given in SA, pp. 300-303, but the formula here quoted is on p. ccxix. Abrahams, in his note, says it is “prescribed for use on the enjoyment of a new possession or pleasure for the first time.”

[^472]: 78:5 _the abstract_. See _M_. IV. 3 note ([p. 30](Berakoth_2_4#p30)).

[^473]: 78:6 _for good . . . for evil_, SA, p. 292.

[^474]: 78:7 _a prayer in vain_. Yet the Rule is that such a prayer may be made until the 40th day after conception (T.B. 60a).

[^475]: 78:8 Because in each case the fact is already fixed.

[^476]: 79:1 Deut. 65.

[^477]: 79:2 _with_. Laible takes this as “for,” which may be right.

[^478]: 79:3 Ps. 119175.

[^479]: 79:4 Ps. 3510.

[^480]: 79:5 _foolish prayers_. Cf. _M_.

[^481]: 79:6 _kors_. The _kor_ was a dry measure equivalent to a _homer_, about 80 gallons.

[^482]: 79:7 flasks (_chabiyoth_). Earthen vessels used, in this case, for holding wine; of no fixed size.

[^483]: 79:8 _R. Dosethai bar Jannai_. In the fourth generation of mishna-teachers, c. 160-200 A.D.

[^484]: 79:9 in \[the passage about\] Isaac. Cf. Mark 1226 “in \[the place concerning\] the Bush;” and perhaps Rom. 112 “in Elijah.” _Vide supra_, [p. 36](Berakoth_2_5#p36).

[^485]: 79:10 Verbally in Gen. 2624, but essentially in vv. 3, _sq_., which makes it easier for ver. 12 to be quoted immediately. But in any case “there is no before nor after in the Law” (T. B. _Pesachim_, 6b).

[^486]: 79:11 _he arose and sowed_. For the anacoluthon Laible compares Matt. 96.

[^487]: 80:1 _a hundred quantities_. Zuckermandel's text has “kinds” (_minim_), but read _minyanim_, with the _Breshith Rabba_, § 64, on Gen. 2612.

[^488]: 80:2 _in what they measured_. Rashi on Gen, 2612 says, “For they valued it (the land), how much it was likely to produce, and it produced a hundred for each one they valued it.”

[^489]: 80:3 _a sukkah_. Every Jew must observe the Feast of Tabernacles by making, and, as far as possible, living in, a booth, _i.e._ a structure of which the essential part is the roof. This is made of branches which must not be so closely interwoven as to prevent three stars being seen through it.

[^490]: 80:4 _who enabled us to reach this season_. These are the closing words of the meditation given in SA, p. 232, which also includes the next prayer.

[^491]: 80:5 _a Lulab_. _Vide supra_, [p. 33](Berakoth_2_4#p33).

[^492]: 80:6 _Tsitsith_. _Vide supra_, [p. 16](Berakoth_1_2#p16).

[^493]: 81:1 _Tephillin_, or Phylacteries. _Vide supra_, [p. 17](Berakoth_1_2#p17).

[^494]: 81:2 _lays them_. _i.e._ binds them on head or arm.

[^495]: 81:3 _He who kills an animal for food_. The Hebrew word is _ha-shôchēt_.

[^496]: 81:4 _circumcision_. The service may be found in SA, pp. 304 _sq_., where the prayers here mentioned are incorporated.

[^497]: 81:5 _He who says the Benediction_. In SA, p. 304, the _Mohel_ himself, _i.e._ he who circumcises the child. The following prayer is on p. 305.

[^498]: 81:6 _the beloved_. Isaac, Gen. 222, “thine only son,” R.V.

[^499]: 81:7 _seal_. Cf. Rom. 411.

[^500]: 82:1 _to deliver_. The Vienna MS., the common text, and T. J. IX. 4 (3), p. 14a bottom, add “from the pit.” And so T. B. _Sabb_. 137b, where Rashi explains, “from Gehenna,” for no circumcised person stays in Gehenna always.

[^501]: 82:2 The common text adds Benedictions to be used at the circumcision of proselytes and slaves, taken from _T_. B. Sabb. 137b.

[^502]: 82:3 _Contributions_. See [p. 59](Berakoth_3_6#p59).

[^503]: 82:4 The prayers are given in _T_.

[^504]: 82:5 _Ben Azzai_. Simeon ben Azzai (a shortened form of Azariah) was one of the famous four, Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Elisha ben Abujah, and Agiba (_c_. 110-135).

[^505]: 83:1 _for what is past . . . for what is about to come_. _i.e._ the substance of his two prayers both on entering and on leaving. They are thus four in all.

[^506]: 83:2 _I acknowledge_ (_môdeh ani_). _i.e._ in open thankfulness and praise. Cf. ἐξομολογεῖσθαι Matt. 1125; Luke 1021; Rom. 1411, 159.

[^507]: 83:3 _a_ \[_public_\] _bath_. It was dangerous more especially because of its elaborate heating apparatus.

[^508]: 83:4 _happen to me_ (_ye’ra‘ bî_). Jastrow (p. 1382b) translates the parallel passage in the Gemara, _T_. B. 60a, “that no mischief or sin may occur through me,” but the immediate reference to death seems to preclude this.

[^509]: 84:1 _let my death be an atonement_, cf. _supra_, [p. 13](Berakoth_1_1#p13). Cf. _Yoma_ VIII. 8: “Death and the Day of Atonement make atonement, with repentance.”

[^510]: 84:2 _all like it, in the future that is to come_. _i.e._ the fire of Gehenna.

[^511]: 84:3 _even so . . . before Thee_. Cf. Matt. 1126; Luke 1021.

[^512]: 84:4 _an uneducated man_ (_bôr_). The first two of these Benedictions are in SA, pp. 5 _sq_., but for the third is given, “Who hast not made me a bondman.”

[^513]: 84:5 Isa. 4017.

[^514]: 84:6 _the commandments_. _i.e._ the many religious duties, not the fundamental duties towards God and man.

[^515]: 84:7 _no uneducated person fears sin_. How can he, in Rabbinic opinion, for he has no accurate knowledge of what constitutes sin?

[^516]: 85:1 _provoked his master_. The point of the parable is, that less is expected from a Gentile, a woman, and an uneducated person. They are all ignorant of the specific religious duties.

[^517]: 85:2 Deut. 65.

[^518]: 85:3 _thy two natures_. See Oesterley, _The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers_, p. 25.

[^519]: 85:4 _wealth_. The word used is _mamon_ (Matt. 624).

[^520]: 85:5 A singularly full example of the play on words so beloved of Rabbinic writers, who, however, do not regard it merely as “play,” but as the legitimate result of the fulness of meaning inherent in Scriptures inspired to every letter.

[^521]: 85:6 _opposite the eastern gate_. As he comes thither on pilgrimage.

[^522]: 86:1 _staff . . . shoes_. Cf. Matt. 1010.

[^523]: 86:2 _the dust on his feet_. Cf. Matt. 1014.

[^524]: 86:3 _a short cut_. The word is _compendiaria_ (_via_).

[^525]: 86:4 B. omits from “What of wearing” to “regulation.” Cf. _T_., infra, p. 220.

[^526]: 86:5 _in his linen cloth_ (_bisdîno_). Which he was wearing, Mark 1451.

[^527]: 86:6 Eccles. 51.

[^528]: 86:7 Esther 42.

[^529]: 86:8 _the Law says_. _i.e._ in Eccles. 51. For the application of the term “the Law” to the Hagiographa, _cf_. John 1034, referring to Ps. 826.

[^530]: 86:9 _All the_ “_seals_.” So C, _kol chôtham_. But this should perhaps be emended to the usual text _kol chôthme_, which may be read as “all the seals,” or “all who sealed.” See the next note.

[^531]: 87:1 “_from ever_.” C reads _hāyu_ _min ha‘ôlām_, literally, “were from ever” or “from the world.” But B has _hāyu_ _’omrīm ‘ad ha‘ôlām_, “all they who sealed the Benedictions which were in the Temple used to say ‘for ever.’” Probably, however, T. VII. 21 is right in reading only _‘ad_, “to,” instead of _min_, “from.”

[^532]: 87:2 _the Heretics_ (_ha Minim_). Here plainly not the Hebrew-Christians, for these never denied the existence of the next world. Cf. pp. [40](Berakoth_2_5#p40) _sq_., [42](Berakoth_2_5#p42).

[^533]: 87:3 _from ever to ever_. Literally, “from the world and even to the world.” Yet in Neh. 95 we find said in the Second Temple, “Arise, bless the LORD your God from ever to ever.” For other references see Dalman, _Worte_, pp. 123 _sq_. (E. T. p. 151).

[^534]: 87:4 _the vestibule_. Cf. _Aboth_, IV. 21(23).

[^535]: 87:5 Neh. 95.

[^536]: 87:6 No mention is made of “Amen.”

[^537]: 87:7 _Yôd_, _Hê_. The first and last letters of YHWH.

[^538]: 87:8 _closeth_. Literally, “sealeth.”

[^539]: 88:1 _not with Daleth_. Laible explains that instead of beginning with Adonai (which stands for YHWH), he begins with Elohim.

[^540]: 88:2 He mentions Elohim twice, suggesting that there is more than one God.

[^541]: 88:3 _the Name_. The following examples suggest that this was the Tetragrammaton. But if so the regulation must be very early.

[^542]: 88:4 Ruth 24.

[^543]: 88:5 Judges 612.

[^544]: 88:6 Prov. 2322. For “thy mother” (’imka) C reads ‘imka “with thee,” as immediately before, or, more probably, _‘amka_ “thy people” _i.e._ thy elders, representing thy people. In any case this is the recognized explanation of “thy mother.” Cf. Hos. ii. 2.

[^545]: 88:7 Ps. 119126.

[^546]: 88:8 R. Nathan's interpretation is that zeal in God's service causes infraction of part of His Law. Here the meaning appears to be that zealous greeting of one's companions leads to a use of the Holy Name which in ordinary cases is wrong. B reads “They break Thy law, because it is time to work for the LORD,” _i.e._ to work for the LORD sometimes requires the infraction of the words of the Law. It seems only to express the meaning of C more definitely.

[^547]: 89:1 _used to dry-nurse it them_. Literally, “used to cause them to swallow it”; _i.e._ they taught people truths without their being aware that they were being taught.

[^548]: 89:2 Ruth 24.

[^549]: 89:3 Judges 612. Again the central truth of the Law is implied.

[^550]: 89:4 Hillel the Elder, see [p. 27](Berakoth_1_3#p27) note.

[^551]: 89:5 When men come in to listen, do thou teach.

[^552]: 89:6 Prov. 1124.

[^553]: 89:7 When none regard it, do thou learn from it.

[^554]: 89:8 Ps. 119126.

[^555]: 89:9 _or the LORD to work_. That is, in anger.

[^556]: 89:10 _whom the commandments_. The ordinary text reads “whom seven commandments,” and this seems necessary.

[^557]: 90:1 Ps. 119164. Cf. the Yalqut on that verse, and on Ps. 61 (§ 633).

[^558]: 90:2 Ps. 121. Circumcision made an eighth commandment. Besides it was generally performed on the eighth day.

[^559]: 90:3 Ps. 347. Each commandment is such an angel.
