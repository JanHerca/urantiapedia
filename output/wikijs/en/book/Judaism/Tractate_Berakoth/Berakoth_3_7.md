## Who may be invited to partake in the Benediction alter Meals.

. **M**.VII. 1. Three persons who have eaten together are bound to give an invitation. [^364] But \[in the case of him who eats\] _Dmai_ [^365] and First Tithes from which their Contribution has been taken, [^366] and Second Tithes [^367] and consecrated things [^368] which have been redeemed, [^369] and the attendant who eats as much as an olive, and the Cuthæan (Samaritan)—one gives no such invitation [^370] with respect to them.

2 (1). But as for him who eats Tebel, [^371] and First Tithes from which their priests’ share has not been taken, and Second Tithes and consecrated things <span id="p60">[<sup><small>p. 60</small></sup>]</span> which have not been redeemed, also if the attendant eats less than as much as an olive, and the stranger [^372]—one gives no invitation with respect to them.

**T**. V. 10. If one is acting as servant to two, behold, he eats with them: [^373] if to three, he does not eat with them until they give him permission. [^374]

<a id="m3"></a>

## Women Slaves and Children excluded. The Quantity of Food over which Grace must be said.

**M**.VII. 3 (2). Women, and slaves, and little children, [^375] are not invited \[to say the Benediction\]. What is the least account of food which qualifies for the invitation? Not less than the size of an olive. R. Judah says not less than the size of an egg.

**T**. V. 14. All are under obligation to say in the case of the Benediction after the meal: priests, Levites, and Israelites and proselytes and slaves, freedmen, priests of illegitimate birth, [^376] Nethinim, and bastards, eunuchs of men, and eunuchs by birth, [^377] and eunuchs of all kinds. [^378] All are under obligation, and can set the majority free from obligation. [^379] Persons of uncertain or double sex <span id="p61">[<sup><small>p. 61</small></sup>]</span> are under obligation, but cannot set the majority free from the obligation.

13\. One who is of double sex sets one like himself free \[from his obligation\], but no one else; one who is of uncertain sex sets neither free.

16\. One who is half a slave and half of free birth sets neither one like himself nor any one else free \[from their obligation\].

17\. Women and slaves and children do not set the majority free from their obligation. \[Yet\] in fact they say: [^380] A woman says the Benediction for her husband, a son for his father, a slave for his master.

18\. A child who can eat anything about the size of an olive we include in the invitation to say the Benediction, but him who cannot eat anything about the size of an olive we do not. We do not insist on preciseness with a child, whether he says, “Let us bless,” or says, “Blessed be He.” We do not take him up for this, but the precisians do take him up for this.

20\. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: If they have gone upstairs, and have reclined at meat, and he dips his hands (in the dish) with them, although he has not eaten with them \[any\] corn as much as an olive, behold these invite him. [^381]

11\. If a sweet relish comes to him in the middle of the meal, one says the Benediction over the meal, and lets the sweet relish go free.

12\. R. Mona [^382] says in the name of R. Judah, A bit of bread that comes with dessert after food requires a Benediction before it and after it.

13\. The first water (for washing before the meal) is a matter of choice; the latter [^383] (after the meal) a <span id="p62">[<sup><small>p. 62</small></sup>]</span> matter of obligation. In the case of the first water if one wishes to leave off, one leaves off; but in the case of the latter water, if one wishes to leave off one does not.

<a id="m4"></a>

## The Words of the Invitation depend on the Number Present.

**M**.VII. 4 (3). How is the invitation worded? [^384] In the case of three persons they say: “Let us bless.” [^385] If there are three besides the speaker, he says: “Blessed be He.” [^386] If there are ten he says: “Let us bless our God.” If there are ten besides the speaker he says: “Blessed be He.” It is all the same whether there be ten or ten myriads. [^387]

5 (3 _cont_.). In the case of a hundred he says: “Let us bless the LORD our God.” In the case of a hundred besides the speaker he says: “Blessed be He.” In the case of a thousand they say: “Let <span id="p63">[<sup><small>p. 63</small></sup>]</span> us bless the LORD our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts.” [1](Berakoth_3_7#fn_388)

In the case of a myriad besides the speaker, he says: “Blessed be He.” According to the wording of his blessing [2](Berakoth_3_7#fn_389) so do they respond after him: “Blessed be the LORD our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts, dwelling between the cherubim for the meal that we have eaten.”

R. Jose, the Galilean, says: According to the number of the congregation do they frame the Benediction, for it is said, “By congregations bless ye God the LORD, from the fountain of Israel.” [3](Berakoth_3_7#fn_390)

6 (3 _cont_.). R. Aqiba says: How do we find it in the synagogue? [4](Berakoth_3_7#fn_391) It is all one whether there be many or few; they say, Bless ye the LORD.“ R. Ishmael says: ”Bless ye the LORD who is blessed." [5](Berakoth_3_7#fn_392)

<a id="m7"></a>

## Companies, how to be divided.

7\. (4 _cont_.). Three who have eaten together are not allowed to separate. [^393] So also with four or <span id="p64">[<sup><small>p. 64</small></sup>]</span> five. If there are six they may be divided, and so up to ten. [^394] But not ten until there be twenty.

**T**. V. 19. In the case of twenty persons they are divided \[into two groups\], provided that there be none among them who separated himself from the invitation. [^395]

<a id="m8"></a>

## On Companies joining for the Benediction at the End of a Meal. The Benediction over Wine—Whether Water should be added first.

**M**.VII. 8 (5). If there are two companies that are eating in one house when some of them \[can\] see the others, behold, they join themselves together to give the invitation \[to say the Benediction\]. But if not, then they give the invitation each party to themselves.

They do not say the Benediction over the wine until one puts water into it. This is the opinion of R. Eliezer. [^396] But the Majority say: They say the Benediction.

## Footnotes

[^365]: 59:1 _to give an invitation_. One of those present must invite the other two to join with him in a Benediction at the end of a meal. SA, p. 279, with Abrahams' note; _vide supra_, [p. 50](Berakoth_3_6#p50).

[^366]: 59:2 _Dmai_. Literally, “suspicion” or “talk.” Fruits about which there is a suspicion whether they have been tithed or not. The third treatise of the Mishna deals with this subject, and is so called. For the duty of tithing see Lev. 2730.

[^367]: 59:3 _First Tithes from which their Contribution has been taken_. For the Contribution see Num. 1519-21, and Driver's note on Deut. 126. It is said to have varied from the sixtieth to the fortieth part of the whole untithed produce. The remainder was tithed.

[^368]: 59:4 _Second Tithes_, Num. 1826. The Second Tithe was taken from the remainder after the First Tithe.

[^369]: 59:5 _consecrated things_. As for example, Firstlings, Lev. 2726 _sq_.

[^370]: 59:6 _which have been redeemed_. This refers to the two last cases, for only if they were redeemed could they be eaten. Redemption was made by giving the value of the thing plus a fifth of that value, Lev. 2713, 31.

[^371]: 59:7 _one gives no such invitation_. B omits the negative, and rightly, in view of the next clause.

[^372]: 59:8 _Tebel_. Food from which no Contribution or Tithe has been taken.

[^373]: 60:1 _the stranger_. Neither Jew nor Samaritan.

[^374]: 60:2 _he eats with them_. He makes a third person, enabling the formal invitation to be given. It is understood that he is a Jew.

[^375]: 60:3 _until they give him permission_. For his presence is not necessary.

[^376]: 60:4 Cf. _M_. III. 3 (_supra_, [p. 23](Berakoth_1_3#p23)).

[^377]: 60:5 priests of illegitimate birth (_chālālim_), _e.g._ sons of a priest who had married a widow.

[^378]: 60:6 Cf. Matt. 1912.

[^379]: 60:7 The language is that of Deut. 231.

[^380]: 60:8 _can set . . . free from obligation_. By one of them saying the Benediction on behalf of those who are present.

[^381]: 61:1 _they say_. _i.e._ This is the Rule.

[^382]: 61:2 _these invite him_, viz., to say the Benediction after the meal.

[^383]: 61:3 _R. Mona_. His usual name, as it seems, is Mana. Evidently a mishna-teacher of the fourth generation, c. 160-200 A.D.

[^384]: 61:4 _The first water . . . the latter_. These become technical expressions for the ceremonial washing before and after meals, and p. 62 occur in the proverb: “\[The neglect of\] the first water makes one eat pork \[for the host thinks one a Gentile\], and \[the neglect of \] the latter water commits murder,” _i.e._ one duty neglected brings about the commission of a serious, but relatively small, sin, a second the commission of a great one. The proverb is given summing up an illustration of its truth, in T. B. _Yoma_, 83 _b_.

[^385]: 62:1 _How is the invitation worded?_ The formulæ are essentially the same as in SA, p. 279. See also Abrahams' notes.

[^386]: 62:2 “_Let us bless_.” Observe the gradation. Here no name is mentioned, for ten alone is a fully religious assembly; where there are ten, “our God”; where a hundred, “the LORD our God” where a thousand, “the LORD our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts”; where a myriad, there is the addition of “dwelling between the cherubims.”

[^387]: 62:3 _Blessed be He_. B has “Bless ye” wherever “Blessed be He” comes in this and the next mishna (in C.).

[^388]: 62:4 _myriads_. See the next mishna (in C.).

[^389]: 63:1 B. adds: “In the case of a thousand besides the speaker, he says, Bless ye. In the case of a myriad one says, Let us bless the Loan our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts, who dwelleth between the cherubim, over the meal that we have eaten.”

[^390]: 63:2 _According to the wording of his blessing_. C has, literally, “According to the subject which he says, blesses” (sic).

[^391]: 63:3 Ps. 6826.

[^392]: 63:4 _in the synagogue_. Where people are going and coming, so that their number is not known, in contrast to a private meal, where it is. Aqiba implies that the practice in the synagogue should guide that elsewhere. Cf. [p. 69](Berakoth_3_8#p69).

[^393]: 63:5 The _Halaka_ (Rule) follows R. Ishmael (Bartenora).

[^394]: 63:6 _to separate_. Into two or more divisions, to say the Grace after the meal. For three is the lowest number for a religious company. Therefore four or five may not be divided. Cf. [p. 50](Berakoth_3_6#p50).

[^395]: 64:1 _ten_. For ten also is a company. Therefore also the numbers from eleven to nineteen may not be divided.

[^396]: 64:2 _from the invitation_. By having already said the Benediction for himself.

[^397]: 64:3 _R. Eliezer_. His reason was that until water was mixed with the wine there was some doubt whether it was drunk (cf. [p. 45](Berakoth_3_6#p45)). The Majority assume it would be. The fact that our Lord spoke a Benediction over the wine at the Last Supper (Mark 1423; Matt. 2627; Luke 2217; and apparently 1 Cor. 1123-25). This supplies no evidence that water had been already mixed with it, if He followed the opinion of the Majority.
