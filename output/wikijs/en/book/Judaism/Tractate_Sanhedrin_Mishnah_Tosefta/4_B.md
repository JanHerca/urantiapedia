## B.—THOSE WHO ARE PUNISHABLE BY BURNING

**M**.IX. 1_a_. These are punishable by burning: he who has criminal connexion with a woman and her daughter, [^367] and a priest's daughter [^368] (who has committed adultery). The term “a woman and her daughter” includes a man's own daughter, his daughter's or son's daughter, his wife's daughter, her daughter's or son's daughter, his mother-in-law, the mother of his father-in-law, and the mother of his mother-in-law.

**T**. XII. 1. These are they who are to be burnt he who has criminal connexion with a woman and her daughter, and a priest's daughter who is bound to a husband. Whether a man have criminal connexion with a woman and afterwards with her daughter, or with a daughter first and afterwards with her mother, he is alike guilty.

Although we have no express sanction from Scripture that he is to be burnt who has criminal connexion with the daughter of one who is not his legal wife—the passage in Scripture: AND THE MAN WHO SHALL TAKE (_i.e._ “marry”) A WOMAN AND HER MOTHER, IT IS LEWDNESS, [^369] dealing with actual marriage—Scripture says: AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANY MAN (OR) PRIEST, [^370] to include every case.

2\. A betrothed damsel and a priest's daughter who has committed adultery are to be stoned. R. Shimeon says that they are to be burnt.
