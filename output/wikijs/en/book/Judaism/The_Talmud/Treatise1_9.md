1\. He who sees a place where signs were wrought for Israel, says, “Blessed be He who wrought signs for our fathers in this place;” a place where idolatry has been rooted out,—says, “Blessed be He who hath rooted idolatry out of our land.”

2\. On comets, earthquakes, lightnings, thunder, and tempests, say, “Blessed be He whose strength and might fill the world.” On mountains, hills, seas, rivers, and deserts, say, “Blessed be He who made the creation.” R. Judah says, when a man sees the great sea he is to say, “Blessed be He who made the great sea,”—when he sees it at intervals. On rains, and on good news say, “Blessed be He who is good and beneficent.” On bad news say, “Blessed be the true Judge.”

3\. He who has built a new house, or bought new furniture, says, “Blessed be He who has kept its alive,” etc. One must bless for evil the source of good; and for good the source of evil. “He who supplicates for what is past?” “Such prayer is vain.” “How?” His wife is pregnant, and he says, “God grant that my wife may bring forth a male <span id="p61">[<sup><small>p. 61</small></sup>]</span> child.” Such prayer is vain. Or if one on the road hear the voice of lamentation in the city, and say, “God grant that it may not be my son, my house,” etc., such prayer is vain.

4\. Whoever enters a fortified town must say two prayers, one at his entrance, and one at his departure. Ben Azai says, “four, two at his entrance, and two at his departure; he returns thanks for the past, and supplicates for the future.”

5\. Man is bound to bless God for evil, as he is bound to bless Him for good. For it is said, “And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might” [^32] “With all thy heart” means, with both thy inclinations, the evil as well as the good. “With all thy soul” means, even should He deprive thee of life; and “with all thy might” means with all thy wealth. Another opinion is, that “with all thy might” means whatever measure He metes out unto thee, do thou thank Him with thy entire might. No man is to be irreverent opposite the eastern gate of the Temple, for it is opposite the Holy of Holies. No man is to go on the mountain of the house with his staff, shoes, or purse, nor with dust on his feet, nor is he to make it a short cut, nor is he to spit at all. All the seals of the blessings in the sanctuary used to say, “from eternity.” But since the Epicureans perversely taught there is but one world, it was directed that men should say, “from eternity to eternity.” It was also directed that every man should greet his friend in THE NAME, as it is said, “And behold Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord (be) with you: and they answered him, The Lord bless thee.” [^33] And it is also said, “The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.” [^34] And it is said, “Despise not thy mother when she is old.” [^35] And it is also said, “(It is) time for (thee), Lord, to work, for they have made void thy law.” [^36] R. Nathan says, “They have made void thy law because (it is) time for (thee), Lord, to work.”
