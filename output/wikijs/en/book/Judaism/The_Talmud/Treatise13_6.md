1\. The priests began ascending the steps of the porch. They who gained the lot for the removal of ashes from the inner altar and from the candlestick, proceeded in front. He who gained the lot for the removal of ashes from the inner altar, entered the Holy Place, and took the flagon, and he bowed down and went out. He who gained the lot for the removal of snuff from the candlestick, entered the Holy Place, and found the two eastern lamps burning; he removed the snuff from the eastern one and left the western one burning, and from it he lighted the candlestick in the evening. If he found it extinguished, he removed the snuff, and <span id="p252"><sup><small>[ p. 252 ]</small></sup></span> lit it from the altar of burnt-offerings. He took the cup from the second step, and he bowed down, and went out.

2\. He who gained the lot for the censer, gathered the live coals on the top of the altar of incense; and he smoothed them with the bottom of the censer, and he bowed down, and went out.

3\. He who gained the lot for the incense, took the pan from the cup, and gave it to his friend or to his neighbour, When the incense was dispersed in it, he supplied it to him in handfuls. And he instructed him, “be careful and do not begin too near yourself, lest you be burned.” He smoothed it and went out. The offerer could not offer the incense, till the Captain said to him, “offer incense.” If the offerer were the high priest, the captain said, “My Lord, High Priest, offer the incense.” The people dispersed, and he offered the incense, and he bowed down and went out from the Holy Place.
