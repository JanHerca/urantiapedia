1\. “The heifer which was slaughtered without the proper intention, (the priest) caught the blood and sprinkled it without the proper intention, or with the proper intention, and afterwards without the proper intention, or without the proper intention, and (afterwards) with the proper intention?” “She is disallowed.” R. Eliezer “allowed her.” “And if the priest did not wash his hands and his feet?” “She is disallowed.” R. Eliezer “allowed her.” “If she was not slaughtered by the High Priest?” “She is disallowed.” R. Judah “allowed her.” “If any of his garments were wanting?” “She is disallowed.” And the rites were performed in white vestments.

2\. If the priest burned her out of her prepared place, or in two places, or burned two in one place?“ ”She is disallowed.“ ”If he sprinkled her blood but not straight in front of the DOOR?“ ”She is disallowed.“ ”If he sprinkled her blood the sixth time for the seventh,—he then turned and sprinkled the seventh?“ ”She is disallowed.“ ”If the priest sprinkled the seventh time for the eighth—he then turned and sprinkled the eighth?“ ”She is allowed.“ <span id="p307">[<sup><small>p. 307</small></sup>]</span> 3\. ”If the priest burned the red heifer without wood, or with every sort of wood, even with stubble and dung?“ [^633] ”She is allowed.“ ”If he skinned and cut her?“ ”She is allowed.“ ”If he slaughtered her on condition of eating from her flesh, and drinking from her blood?“ ”She is allowed.“ Rabbi Eliezer said, ”intention does not disallow the heifer.”

4\. All who are busied about the heifer from the beginning to the end render their garments legally unclean. And any work gained from her renders her disallowed. If any illegality happened during her slaughter, she does not render their garments unclean. If it happened during the sprinkling of her blood, every one busied before her disallowance renders his garments unclean. After her disallowance he does not render his garments unclean. It follows that her difficulty is his convenience. They who are busied about her are always liable for a trespass-offering. They may add wood to her during her burning. And her business is done in the day and by a priest. Every work for gain with her causes her disallowance, until she be reduced to ashes. And work for gain causes disallowance in the water also, until the ashes be strewn upon it.
