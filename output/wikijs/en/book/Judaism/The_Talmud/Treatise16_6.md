1\. “When one wishes to purify, and the ashes of purification have fallen on his hand, or upon the side (of the vessel), and they afterwards fell on a drinking-trough?” “They are disallowed.” “If water of purification fell from a pipe on the trough?” “It is disallowed.” “He took the water of purification out of the pipe, and covered the pipe or shut the door with it?” “The ashes of purification are allowed, but the water is disallowed.” “He laid it on the ground?” “It is disallowed.” “He laid it in his hand?” “It is allowed, because it is not otherwise possible.” <span id="p310"><sup><small>[ p. 310 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. “If the ashes swam on the surface of the water?” R. Meier and Rabbi Simon said, “one may take them and purify;” but the Sages say, “all ashes which have once touched water, cannot purify.” “If one have sprinkled the water, and the ashes be found at the bottom?” R. Meier and R. Simon said, “He may dry them and purify;” but the sages say, “all ashes which have (once) touched water, cannot purify.”

3\. “If one prepare water for purification in a trough, and there be a jug in it?” “Though its mouth be ever so narrow, the water therein can purify.” “If there be a sponge?” “The water in it is disallowed.” “How is one to act?” “He is to sprinkle till he come to the sponge. When he has touched the sponge, even if the water swim over it ever so little, it is disallowed.”

4\. “One has put in his hand, or his foot, or leaves of vegetables, so that the water of purification has run over to another vessel?” “It is disallowed.” If they were leaves of reeds, or leaves of nuts, they are allowed. This is the rule. The thing which contracts uncleanness is disallowed. And the thing which does not contract uncleanness is allowed.

5\. “If one divert a well into a vat-shaped pool, or into a marsh?” “The water in them is disallowed for issues and leprosies, or to purify with it as with the water of the ashes of the heifer, since it is not filled in a vessel.”
