1\. “If one poured on his hand one gush?” “His hand is clean.” “If on both hands one gush?” R. Meir pronounces them “unclean, until one poured out of a quarter log (vessel) upon them.” “If an heave-loaf fall (on the water)?” “It is clean.” R. José “pronounces it unclean.”

2\. “If one poured out his first (ablution) in one place, and his second in another place, and a heave-loaf fall on the first?” “It is unclean.” “If on the second?” “It is clean.” “If one poured out both the first and second (ablutions) into one place, and a heave-loaf fall on them?” “It is unclean.” “If one poured out his first ablution, and find on his hand a splinter or small stone?” “His hands are unclean, as the second water only purifies the first washing on the hand.” [^663] R. Simon, the son of Gamaliel, says, “whatsoever is a creation of the water is clean.” <span id="p326"><sup><small>[ p. 326 ]</small></sup></span> 3\. The hands become legally unclean, or legally clean up to the wrist. “How?” “If one poured the first (ablution) up to the wrist, and the second above the wrist, and the water ran back into the hand?” “It is clean.” “If one poured the first and second (ablutions) above the wrist, and the water ran back into the hand?” “It is unclean.” “If one poured the first (ablution) over one hand, and afterwards the second over both hands?” “They are unclean.” “If one poured the first (ablution) over both hands, and afterwards the second over one hand?” “His hand is clean.” “If one poured water on one hand and then rubbed it against its fellow?” “It is unclean.” “If he rubbed it against his head, or against the wall?” “It is clean.” Men may pour water over four or five persons alongside of each other, or above each other, provided they be separated, so that the water can come on them.

4\. “There is a doubt if the water has been used; there is a doubt if it has not been used; there is a doubt if it be the prescribed quantity, there is a doubt if it be not the prescribed quantity: there is a doubt if it be (legally) unclean, there is a doubt if it be (legally) clean?” “In doubting he is clean,” because the Sages said, “if there be a doubt of his hands being unclean, or imparting uncleanness, or being clean, he is clean.” R. José said, “if there be a doubt of cleanness it is uncleanness.” “How?” “His hands are clean, and before him are two unclean loaves, it is doubtful if he touched them, it is doubtful if he did not touch them: his hands are unclean, and before him are two clean loaves, it is doubtful if he touched them, it is doubtful if he did not touch them?” “His hands are one unclean and one clean.” “And before him are two clean loaves: he touched one of them, it is doubtful if he touched the unclean, it is doubtful if he touched the clean?” “His hands are clean.” “And before him are two loaves, one unclean and one clean, he touched one of them, it is doubtful if he touched the unclean, it is doubtful if he touched the clean?” “His hands are one unclean and one clean.” “And before him are two loaves, one unclean and one clean, he touched both of them, it is <span id="p327"><sup><small>[ p. 327 ]</small></sup></span> doubtful if it were the unclean (loaf) with the unclean (hand), or the clean (loaf) with the clean (hand), or the clean loaf with the unclean (hand), or the unclean loaf with the clean hand?” “The hands remain as they were, and the loaves as they were.” [^664]
