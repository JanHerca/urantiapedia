1\. The whole time that it is allowed to eat leaven, men may feed beasts with it, and wild animals and fowls, and they may sell it to a stranger. And they are allowed to enjoy it in every way. When that season has passed over its enjoyment is disallowed, and they must not heat with it an oven or a stove. Rabbi Judah said, “there is no riddance of leaven but by burning.” But the Sages say, “also by powdering and scattering it to the wind, or casting it into the sea.”

2\. “The leaven of a stranger, over which the passover has passed?” “Its enjoyment is allowed.” “But of an Israelite?” “Its enjoyment is disallowed,” as is said, [^124] “And there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee.”

3\. “The stranger who has lent money to an Israelite on his leaven?” “After passover its enjoyment is allowed.” “And an Israelite who lent money to the stranger on his leaven?” “Its enjoyment after passover is disallowed.” “Leaven over which a building fell?” “It is as though it was cleared away.” Rabban Simon, son of Gamaliel, said, “all after which the dog cannot snuff.”

4\. “He who has eaten a leavened heave-offering during the passover in error?” “He must pay its value and a fifth more.” “In presumption?” “He is free from the payment, and from its value even for fuel.” [^125]

5\. These are the things by which one can discharge his obligation to eat unleavened bread during the passover; with cakes made of wheat, and barley, and rye, and oats, and spelt; and they discharge their obligation in that of which the tithing was doubtful, and in the first tithe after the heave-offering was separated from it, and in second tithes and holy things after their redemption. And the priests discharge their obligation with cakes of dough-offering and heave-offering, but not with that which owes first tithes, or before the heave-offering was separated from it, nor with <span id="p98">[<sup><small>p. 98</small></sup>]</span> that which owes second tithes or holy things before their redemption. “The loaves of the praise-offering and the cakes of the Nazarite?” “If made for themselves, they do not discharge the obligation: if made for sale in the market, they discharge the obligation.”

6\. And these are the herbs with which one discharges his obligation to eat bitter herbs in the passover:—lettuce, endives, horse-radish, liquorice, and coriander. The obligation can be discharged whether they be moist or dry, but not if they be pickled, or much boiled, or even a little boiled. And they may be united to form the size of an olive. And the obligation may be discharged with their roots; and also if their tithes be in doubt; and with their first tithing, when the heave-offering has been taken from them; and with their second tithe, and with holy things which are redeemed.

7\. Persons must not moisten bran during the passover for chickens, but they may scald it. A woman must not moisten bran in her hand when she goes to the bath. But she may rub it dry on her flesh. A man should not chew wheat and leave it on a wound during Passover, because it becomes leavened.

8\. People must not put flour into the charoseth [^126] or into the mustard. “But if one puts it?” “He must eat it offhand.” But Rabbi Meier forbids it. They must not boil the passover offering in liquids nor in fruit juice. But one may smear it (after it is roasted), or dip it into them. Water used by the baker must be poured away because it becomes leavened.
