There were provided eleven curtains of goats’ hair, and the length of every one of them was thirty cubits, as is said, “And thou shalt make curtains of goats’ (hair) to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou <span id="p338">[<sup><small>p. 338</small></sup>]</span> make. The length of one curtain (shall be) thirty cubits.” [^706] And they were coupled in two vails, one of five, and one of six, as is said, “And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves,” [^707] and they were coupled with fifty loops, as is said, “And he made fifty loops upon the outmost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.” [^708] And the loops were coupled to fifty taches of brass, as is said, “And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together that it may be one.” [^709] The length of the curtains was thirty cubits. Take from them ten cubits for their breadth, there will remain ten cubits from one side, and ten cubits from the other side, as they hung down and covered the boards and the sockets. The breadth of the curtains was forty-four cubits, as is said, “And the breadth of one curtain four cubits; and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure.” [^710] Take from them thirty cubits for the length of the tabernacle, and ten cubits behind the tabernacle—these are forty. There was left there one curtain which was doubled in front of the tent, as is said, “and thou shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.” [^711] Rabbi Judah said, “half of it was doubled in the forefront of the tabernacle, and half of it was hanging behind the tabernacle,” as is said, “And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.” [^712] There was also provided one great cover of rams’ skins dyed red, its length thirty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits; with it they clothed the tent upon the tabernacle from east to west, as is said, “And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers’ skins,” [^713] and it was made “like patchwork.” [^714] The words of Rabbi Nehemiah. Rabbi Judah said, “there were two covers—the lower one of rams’ skins dyed red, and the <span id="p339">[<sup><small>p. 339</small></sup>]</span> upper one of badgers’ skins,” as is said, “his covering and the covering of the badgers’ skins that is above upon it.” [^715]
