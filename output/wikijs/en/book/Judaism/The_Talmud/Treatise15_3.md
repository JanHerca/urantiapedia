1\. Every one afflicted with leprosy is legally unclean, excepting foreigners and the sojourning stranger. Every one is eligible for the inspection of leprosy, but the declaration of uncleanness and of cleansing belongs to the priest. They say to him “pronounce unclean;” and he says “unclean.” “Pronounce clean;” and he says “clean.” Two leprosies are not inspected at once, whether in one man or in two men; but the priest inspects the first, and he incloses it, or pronounces it fretting, or legally frees him; and then he turns to the second. They do not inclose that which is already inclosed, and they do not pronounce fretting, that which is pronounced fretting, they do not inclose that which is pronounced fretting; and they do not pronounce fretting, that which is inclosed. But in the beginning, or in the end of the seven days, him who is inclosed the priest can inclose; him who is pronounced fretting, the priest can pronounce fretting. He can inclose and he can free. He can declare “fretting” and he can declare “free.”

2\. To the bridegroom in whom leprosy has appeared the Sages permit the seven days of the feast, be the leprosy in himself, in his house, or in his clothing. And so also in a festival, they permit to him all the days of the feast.

3\. The skin of the flesh is unclean in two weeks, and with three marks; with white hair, and quickflesh, and spreading. With white hair and quickflesh in the beginning and in the end of the first week, and in the end of the second week, even after being pronounced free. And with spreading in the end of the first week, and in the end of the second week even after being pronounced free, and it renders the leper unclean for two weeks which make thirteen days.

4\. The boil and the burning cause uncleanness for one week with two marks, with white hair and with spreading. With white hair in the beginning or in the end of the week, even after being pronounced free. And in spreading in the end of the week, even after being pronounced free. <span id="p272">[<sup><small>p. 272</small></sup>]</span> And they render the leper unclean for one week which has seven days.

5\. Scalls [^595] cause uncleanness in two weeks with two marks, with thin yellow hair, and with spreading. With thin yellow hair in the beginning, or in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week, even after being pronounced free. And in spreading, in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week, even after being pronounced free. And they cause uncleanness in two weeks which have thirteen days.

6\. The scall on the back of the bald head, or on the bald forehead causes uncleanness in two weeks with two marks, with quickflesh and with spreading. With quickflesh in the beginning or in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week, even after being pronounced free. And with spreading in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week, even after being pronounced free. And they cause uncleanness in two weeks which have thirteen days.

7\. Garments cause uncleanness in two weeks, and with three marks—greenish, reddish, and spreading. Greenish and reddish (marks) in the beginning, or in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week even after being pronounced free. And in spreading, in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week, even after being pronounced free. And they cause uncleanness in two weeks which have thirteen days.

8\. Houses cause uncleanness in three weeks and with three marks—greenish, reddish, and spreading. Greenish and reddish (marks) in the beginning, or in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week, or in the end of the third week, even after being pronounced free. And spreading in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week, or in the end of the third week, even after being pronounced free. And they cause uncleanness in three weeks which have nineteen days. For leprosy there is no separation for less than one week, or for more than three weeks.
