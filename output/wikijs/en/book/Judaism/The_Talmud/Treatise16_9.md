1\. “A pan full of the water of purification into which ordinary water, however little, has fallen?” R. Eliezer said, “one must sprinkle twice with it.” But the Sages “disallow it.” “If dew fell into it?” R. Eliezer said, “let him leave it in the sun, and the dew evaporates.” But the Sages “disallow it.” “If fluid has fallen into it, or fruit juice?” “Let him pour it out, and it is necessary to dry it.” Ink, gum, and vitriol, and everything which can be remarked, must be poured out, and there is no necessity to dry it.

2\. “If insects and worms have fallen in, and burst or changed their appearance?” “The water is disallowed” A black beetle, though not burst nor changed, disallows it, since it is like a pipe. Rabbi Simon and R. Eliezer the son of Jacob said, “the wheat worm and the grain worm are allowed, because there is no matter in them.”

3\. “If a beast or animal drink of it?” “They disallow it.” All fowls disallow it, excepting the dove, because it sucks. All creeping animals do not disallow it, excepting <span id="p316"><sup><small>[ p. 316 ]</small></sup></span> the weasel, because it laps. Rabban Gamaliel said, “also the serpent because it spues.” R. Eliezer said, “also the mouse.”

4\. “If one think to drink the water of purification?” R. Eliezer said, “it is disallowed.” R. Joshua said, “when he drew it (towards him).” R. José said, “of what are they talking, of water in which there are no ashes.” “But of water in which there are ashes?” R. Eliezer said, “when he drew it (towards him).” R. Joshua said, “when he drinks.” But if it be poured into his throat, it is allowed.

5\. Water of purification which is disallowed, must not be kneaded in mortar, lest it bring misfortune to others. R. Judah said, “it is worthless.” “A cow which drank water of purification?” “Her flesh is unclean for twenty-four hours.” [^649] R. Judah said, “it becomes worthless in her intestines.”

6\. The water of purification and the ashes of purification must not be passed over a river even in a boat, nor may they be floated on the surface of water. Nor may one stand on one side and throw them to the other side. But one may pass with them through water, which is up to his neck. He who is cleansed for purification, may pass over water with empty vessels in his hand cleansed for purification, and with water in which there are no ashes.

7\. “Ashes which are allowed for purification; when they are mixed in ordinary ashes?” “We must follow the majority [^650] (in reference to uncleanness) and they do not purify with them.” Rabbi Eleazar said, “they may purify with them all.”

8\. Water intended for purification which was disallowed, renders unclean (him who was) cleansed for the heave-offering in his hands and body, but it does not render unclean him who was cleansed for purification, either in his hands or in his body. “If it were rendered unclean?” “It renders unclean (him who was) cleansed for the heave-offering in his hands and in his body, but (him who was) cleansed for purification it renders unclean, in his hands, but not in his body.” <span id="p317"><sup><small>[ p. 317 ]</small></sup></span> 9\. Ashes which are allowed when put on the surface of water, which is unsuitable for purification, render unclean him who was cleansed for the heave-offering in his hands and body, but it does not render unclean him who was cleansed for purification, either in his hands or in his body.

## Footnotes

[^656]: 316:1 Lit. from time to time.

[^657]: 316:2 The meaning is, that if the greater part of the ashes be legal, purification would follow. But if the greater part be ordinary ashes, there would be no purification.
