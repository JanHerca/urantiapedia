THE CANDLESTICK which Moses made in the wilderness was wrought from gold, and required hammering, and required knops and flowers, as is said, “And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.” [^762] “Do I hear that he shall make separate members and join them to it?” “The teaching says, that ‘they shall be of the same.’” “Whence know we that it extends to the light?” “The teaching says, ‘Thou shalt make.’” “I am of opinion that it should be extended to the bowls, knops, and flowers. The teaching says ‘it,’ and what dost thou see to extend it to the light, and withhold it from the bowls, the knops, and the flowers?” “Because the verse extends and withholds, (therefore) I extend (it to) the lights that they should be made with it, and I withhold the bowls, the knops, and the flowers, that they should not be made with it.” “Whence know we to extend (it to) the tongs and snuff-dishes?” “The teaching says, ‘thou shalt make.’” “I am of opinion to extend (it to) the snuffers, and the tweezers.” “The teaching says, ‘it,’ and what dost thou see to extend (it to) the tongs and snuff-dishes, and to withhold (it from) the snuffers?” “Because the verse extends and withholds. I extend (it to) the tongs and snuff-dishes, since they are used with it. And I withhold (it from) the snuffers and tweezers, since they are not used with it.” As it was made of gold, it required hammering; when it was not of gold it did not require hammering. When it was made of gold it <span id="p348">[<sup><small>p. 348</small></sup>]</span> required bowls, knops, and flowers; when it was not of gold it did not require bowls, knops, and flowers. When it was made of gold it required a talent; when it was not of gold it did not require a talent. Rabbi Joshua the son of Korcha said, “it (the candlestick) was made of a talent, but the lights, and the tongs, and the snuff-dishes, were not from the talent,” as is said, “Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it.” [^763] “And what do I establish?” “That all these vessels were vessels of pure gold. But the trumpets which Moses made in the wilderness were made of silver only, as is said, ‘Make thee two trumpets of silver.’” [^764]
