1\. The high priest may judge, and be judged. [^373] He may bear witness, and witness may be borne against him. He may have his shoe loosed, and the shoe may be loosed for his wife. [^374] His brother may take his wife, but he must not take his brother's wife, because he is prevented from marrying a <span id="p179">[<sup><small>p. 179</small></sup>]</span> widow. If there happened a death in his family, he must not go immediately behind the bier. “But when the (mourners) are concealed (in a street), then he is discovered (to the public). They are discovered to the public, and he is concealed in a street. And he may go with them to the entrance gate of the city.” The words of R. Meier. R. Judah said, “he must not depart from the sanctuary;” as is said, “neither shall he go out of the sanctuary.” [^375] And when he comforts others, the fashion of all the people is to pass one after the other, and the deputy priest puts him in the middle between himself and the people. But when he is comforted by others, all the people say to him, “we are thy atonement.” And he says to them, “you shall be blessed from heaven.” And at the first meal [^376] after a funeral, all the people recline on the ground, and he sits on a stool.

2\. The king neither judges, nor is judged. He neither bears witness, nor is witness borne against him. He does not unloose the shoe, and the shoe is not unloosed for his wife. He does not marry his brother's wife, nor is his wife married by his brother. R. Judah said, “if he pleased he may unloose the shoe, or marry his brother's wife. He is remembered in prayer for good.” The Sages said to him, “we do not hear him (the king) (for unloosing the shoe) and his widow must not marry.” R. Judah said, “the king may marry the widow of a king, as we find with David that he married the widow of Saul;” as is said, “And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom.” [^377]

3\. If there happened a death in his family, he goes not out from the entrance of his palace. R. Judah said, “if he pleases to go after the bier he may go, as we find in David that he went after the bier of Abner;” as is said, “And King David himself followed the bier.” [^378] The Sages said to him, “this only happened to pacify the people.” And at the first meal after a funeral, all the people recline on the ground, and he sits on a sofa.

4\. And he may go forth to lawful warfare by order of the supreme court of seventy-one, and he may break down a <span id="p180">[<sup><small>p. 180</small></sup>]</span> road for himself, and none can prevent him. The road of a king is without measure, and all the people plunder and lay it before him. And he takes part first. He must not multiply wives beyond eighteen. R. Judah said, “he may multiply wives for himself so long as they do not turn away his heart.” R. Simon said, “even if one turn away his heart, he should not marry her.” If so, wherefore is it said, “he must not multiply for himself wives, even though they be as Abigail”? He must not multiply horses, except sufficient for his own riding. And silver and gold he must not multiply much, only sufficient to pay his own expenses. And he must write a book of the law for himself. When he goes out to war, he must bring it with him. When he returns, he must bring it with him. If he sit in judgment it is with him. When he is seated it is before him, as is said, “And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life.” [^379]

5\. None may ride on his horse, and none may sit on his chair, and none may use his sceptre, and none may see him shaving, either when he is naked, or in the bath, as is said, “Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee,” [^380] that his dread be upon thee.
