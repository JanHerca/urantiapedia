### CHAPTER VI.

§ 1. He who dwells in one court with a heathen, or with one who does not acknowledge \[the validity of\] erub, is through them prohibited \[from carrying or moving therein\]. Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, “At no time can \[such\] a prohibition be caused, unless by two Israelites who prevent each other.”

§ 2. R. Gamaliel related, “It happened that a Sadducee dwelt with us in one alley, in Jerusalem; and my father said to us \[on the Sabbath-eve\], ‘Make haste and bring all the vessels into the alley, lest this \[Sadducee\] bring out his, and make it unlawful for you \[to carry out yours\].’” R, Jehudah related \[the same circumstance\], with a variation in the language: “Make haste and do what you require \[done\] in the alley, lest he come out and make it unlawful for you.”

§ 3. Should one of the householders of a court forget, and not join in the erub, it is unlawful for him and for them \[the other inmates of the court\], to carry any thing out of, or into his house; but their \[houses\] it is lawful for him and for them to carry into, and out of; if they \[the other inmates\] have resigned to him their \[common\] right \[to the court\], he is permitted \[to carry and convey therein\], but they are forbidden \[so to do\]. If there be two \[who have neglected to join in the erub\], they impede each other; for one individual can renounce \[the\] right \[to the court\], and can acquire \[that\] right; but two persons \[though they can jointly\] renounce the right, cannot \[jointly\] acquire the right \[to the exclusive use of the court\].

§ 4. From when is the right to be conferred? Beth Shammai hold, “while it is yet day-light;” but Beth Hillel hold, “from dusk \[on the eve of the day of rest\].” Whoever renounces his right \[to the court\], and afterwards carries \[or conveys within it\], whether he does it inadvertently or intentionally, he renders it unlawful for them \[the other inmates of the court to carry or convey therein\]. Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but R. Jehudah saith, “If he does it intentionally, he makes it unlawful \[for them\], but if inadvertently, he does not make it unlawful.”

§ 5. Should a householder be in partnership in \[one cask of\] wine with two of his neighbours \[residing in the same alley\], they require no erub; if he is partner with one in wine, and with one in <span id="p85">[<sup><small>p. 85</small></sup>]</span> oil, they do require an erub: R. Simeon saith, “In the one \[case\] as in the other, they do not require any erub.”

§ 6. Should five different companies take their Sabbath-rest in one saloon, [^222] Beth Shammai hold, “that each company requires a separate erub;” but Beth Hillel hold “that one erub \[is sufficient\] for \[them\] all.” Both agree, that if any of these companies occupy distinct chambers, or attics, \[then\] each company requires a separate erub.

§ 7. Brothers, or associates, who take their meals at their fathers’, \[or at one\] table, but sleep \[each\] in his \[separate\] house \[in the same court\], must each one prepare a separate erub. Therefore, if one of them has forgotten, and not prepared an erub, he must renounce his right \[to the common court\]. When is this the case? When the erub has been deposited in some other place \[house\]; but if the erub has been placed with them, or if there are no other inhabitants in the court, they need not prepare any erub.

§ 8. Five courts that open into each other, and also open into one \[common alley\], if they \[the householders therein\] have joined in erub for the courts, but have not combined the alley, [^223] they are permitted \[to carry and convey\] in the courts, but are prohibited \[so to do\] in the alley; but if they did combine the alley, they are permitted in both \[courts and alley\]. If they have combined the courts and also the alley, should one of the householders of the courts forget, and not join in the erub, they are \[nevertheless\] permitted \[to carry and convey\] in both \[courts and alley\]; should one of the householders of the alley have forgotten to join in the combination, they are permitted \[to carry and convey\] in the courts, but are forbidden \[so to do\] in the alley, \[inasmuch\] as the alley is \[in the same relation\] to the courts, as the courts \[are\] to the houses \[within them\].

§ 9. If two courts be one within the other, \[should\] the \[inmates of the\] inner court prepare its erub, and \[those of\] the outer court not, \[the inmates of\] the inner court may \[carry and convey within it\],but \[those of\] the outer court must not \[do so\]. Should \[those of\], the outer court have prepared the erub, but not \[those of\] the inner court, both are prohibited; if each have prepared its separate erub, the \[inmates of\] each are permitted \[to carry or convey\] within its own limits. R. Akivah holds that the outer court is prohibited, and that the right of thoroughfare \[possessed by the inner court\] <span id="p86">[<sup><small>p. 86</small></sup>]</span> renders it so; but the sages hold that this right of thoroughfare does not render \[the outer court\] prohibited.

§ 10. Should one \[of the householders\] of the outer court forget to join in the erub, the inner court is permitted, but the outer court is prohibited. Should one \[of the householders\] of the inner court forget to join in the erub; both are prohibited. If they both deposit their erub in one place, and one \[of the householders\], whether of the inner or of the outer \[court\] forgot, and did not join in the erub, both are prohibited. Should each court be the property of a single individual, \[or inhabited by one household only\] they require no erub.
