### CHAPTER VIII.

§ 1. Whoever carries out wine sufficient to mix a goblet \[of wine\], [^114] \[such as is used at grace after meat\], milk equal to a mouthful, honey sufficient to spread upon a sore, oil sufficient to anoint a small limb \[joint\], water sufficient to form a colyrium \[wash for one eye\], or of any other kind of beverage, quarter of a lug, and also of whatever can be poured out \[liquids\], quarter of a lug. R. Simeon saith, "For all \[the articles here enumerated\] the legal quantity is one quarter lug; and the \[various\] quantities here specified are only for those who conserve \[keep the articles\].

§ 2. Whoever carries out rope sufficient to make a handle for a box, \[basket\], or reed sufficient to make a hook for \[whereon to hang\] a fine, or a coarse sieve; R. Jehudah saith, “Sufficient to take measure for a child's shoe, paper sufficient to write thereon a toll-bill [^115], and, \[lastly, whoever carries out\] a toll-bill of blotted paper, sufficient, to wrap a small balm flask therein, is guilty.”

§ 3. Vellum sufficient for an amulet, \[double wove parchment sufficient to write a mezoozah thereon\], single wove parchment sufficient to write thereon the smallest section \[parashah\] of the Tephilin, which is ‏שמע ישראל‎, ink sufficient to write two letters, paint sufficient to dye one eye. [^116]

§ 4. Bird-lime sufficient to put on the top of the lime twig; pitch, or sulphur, sufficient to fill up a tube of quicksilver; wax sufficient to stop up a small leak \[in a wine cask\]; loam sufficient to make an <span id="p49"><sup><small>[ p. 49 ]</small></sup></span> orifice \[for a bellows\], or the crucible of a gold refiner. R. Jehudah saith, “sufficient to make a stand \[for such a crucible\], lime sufficient to cover the little finger of a maiden.” R. Jehudah saith, “sufficient to cover one of her temples.” R. Nehemiah saith, “sufficient to anoint one of her temples \[withal\].” [^117]

§ 5. Red loam sufficient to seal a bale of goods. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages hold, “sufficient to seal a letter therewith.” Dung, or fine sand, sufficient to manure a cabbage-stalk. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages hold, “sufficient to manure a leek therewith.” Coarse sand sufficient to fill a trowel, reed sufficient to make a writing-pen, and should it be thick or split, sufficient to boil the lightest of eggs [^118], \[which\], mixed with oil, \[lies\] in a hot shell.

§ 6. Bone sufficient to make a spoon. R. Jehudah saith, “sufficient to make \[a fitting\] for a key.” Glass sufficient to scrape the top of a weaver's shuttle therewith, a lump of mould, or a stone, large enough to throw at a bird. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, “large enough to throw at a beast.”

§ 7. Potsherds large enough to put between deals to poise them. Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but R. Meir saith, “large enough to shovel up ignited fuel therewith.” R. José saith, “large enough to receive \[hold\] quarter \[of a lug\].” R. Meir saith, “Although there is not \[any absolute\] proof in support \[of my\] assertion, there is an indication \[of my\] assertion; for it is said, ‘There shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth.’” [^119] But R. José replied, “\[Can you\] thence \[adduce\] a proof? \[Does not the sentence conclude with the words\], ‘or to take water withal out of the pit?’” [^120]
