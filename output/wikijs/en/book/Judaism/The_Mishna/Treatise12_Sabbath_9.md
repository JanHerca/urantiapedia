### CHAPTER IX.

§ 1. R. Akivah saith, “Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that carrying an idol maketh unclean, even as menstruation doth? From the text, ‘Thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth: thou shalt say unto it \[the idol\], get thee hence.’ [^121] Even as the carrying of a menstruous cloth defileth, so does likewise the carrying of an idol.”

<span id="p50">[<sup><small>p. 50</small></sup>]</span>

§ 2. Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that a ship is clean? From the text, “The way of a ship in the heart \[midst\] of the sea.” [^122] Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that in a garden-bed, six hands square, five different kinds of seed may be sown; \[i.e.\] four \[kinds\] in the four corners of the garden-bed, and the fifth in the middle? [^123] From the text, “For as the earth, bringeth forth her bud, and the garden causeth ‏זְרוּעֶיהָ‎, her seeds, to spring forth.” [^124] The text does not say, ‏זַרְעָהּ‎ \[her seed, in the singular, as if of one kind only\], but ‏זְרוּעֶיהָ‎, \[her seeds of various kinds\].

§ 3. Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that a woman who sheds semen on the third day \[after coition\] is unclean? From the text, “And be ye ready against the third day.” [^125] Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that a circumcised infant is to be bathed \[washed\] on the third day \[after circumcision\], even though that falls on the Sabbath? From the text, “And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,” [^126] Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that a red string is to be tied to the head of the scapegoat? [^127] From the text, “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall become white as snow.” [^128]

§ 4. Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that anointing is \[as unlawful\] as drinking on the day of atonement? Although there is no \[absolute proof\] for this assertion, there is an indication thereof in the text, “Let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.” [^129]

§ 5. He \[is likewise guilty\] who carries out wood sufficient to boil a light egg, spices sufficient to season a light egg; and \[different kinds of spice are to be\] computed together. Nut-shells, pomegranate peels, isatis \[woad\], and madder, sufficient to dye a small cap-cloth; urine, alum, ‏בורית‎, and ‏קמוליא‎ and ‏אשלג‎, [^130] sufficient to wash a small cap-cloth. R. Jehudah saith, “sufficient to pass over a blood-stain, \[by way of experiment to see if it can be taken out\].”

§ 6. Pimento the smallest quantity, extract of pitch the smallest quantity; all kinds of spice \[perfumes\] and of metals \[ores\] the smallest quantity. Altar stones and altar dust, [^131] fragments of rolls of <span id="p51">[<sup><small>p. 51</small></sup>]</span> the law, and fragments of their wrappers \[gnawed to pieces by moths\] the smallest quantity; because these things are preserved to be secreted. R. Jehudah saith, also, “whoever carries out the smallest quantity of what has been used for idol-worship; for it is said, ‘And there shall cleave nought of the accursed thing to thine hand.’” [^132]

If a man carry out the box of a dealer in spices \[apothecary\], although there be various kinds \[of spice\] therein, he is \[only\] bound to bring one sin-offering. Garden seeds, \[rather\] less than the size of a dried fig. R. Jehudah ben Bethera saith, “Five \[things there are of which, should a man carry the smallest quantity, he is guilty\], cucumber seeds two \[grains\],pumpkin seeds two \[grains\],Egyptian bean-seed \[two grains\], a clean [^133] live grasshopper any portion \[however small\], \[if it be\] dead the size of a dried fig. A vineyard bird [^134] any \[the smallest\] portion \[be it\] dead or alive.” R. Jehudah saith, “He likewise \[is guilty\]who carries out any \[the smallest\] portion of an unclean live grasshopper, because these are preserved for children to play with.”
