### CHAPTER XV.

§ 1. These \[are the kind of\] knots which render \[a man\] guilty: the camel-drivers’ knot, and the \[sailors’\] boatmen's knot; [^149] and as he becomes guilty by tying \[splicing\] them, so does he likewise become guilty by untying them. R. Meir saith, “A knot which he can untie with one hand only, he does not become guilty for \[untying\].”

§ 2. There are other knots, the tying or untying of which does not render guilty, as the camel-drivers’ and \[sailors’\] boatmen's knots \[do\]: a woman may tie the slit in her chemise, and her cap-ribbons, and her stay-laces \[girdle\], and her shoe-strings, and her sandal-laces; \[also\] skins of oil, and of wine, and pots of meat. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, “They may tie a rope before a beast, to prevent its going out.” A pail may be tied \[to a well\] by a girdle, but not by a rope. R. Jehudah laid down the rule, "Any knot which is not intended to be lasting \[tied once for good and all\] does not cause \[any one\] to become guilty.

§ 3. Clothes may be folded even four or five times; on the evening of the Sabbath, the beds may be made for \[use on\] the Sabbath; but they must not be made on the Sabbath, for \[to be used\] after the Sabbath is out. R. Ishmael saith, “The clothes may be folded, and the beds made on the day of atonement, for \[use on\] the Sabbath.” [^150] And the fat of the Sabbath-sacrifices may be offered on the day of atonement: \[another version adds, “but not that of the day of atonement on the Sabbath.”\] R. Akivah saith, “That of the Sabbath must not be offered on the day of atonement, nor that of the day of atonement on the Sabbath.”
