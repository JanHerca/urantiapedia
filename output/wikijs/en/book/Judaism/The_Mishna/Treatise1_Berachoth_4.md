### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. The morning prayer \[may be said\] until noon. R. Jehudah saith, “until the fourth hour.” The ‏מנחה‎ prayer until the evening. R. Jehudah saith, “until \[the expiration\] of half the time \[appointed for\] the ‏מנחה‎ sacrifice. The evening prayer \[is not limited\] to any fixed time, and the ‏מוסף‎ \[additional prayer\] \[may be said\] all day. R. Jehudah saith, ”until the seventh hour \[only\].”

§ 2. R. Nehooniah ben Hakanah used to pronounce a short prayer when he entered the Beth Hamedrash \[College\], and again <span id="p6">[<sup><small>p. 6</small></sup>]</span> when he left it. They \[the sages\] asked him, “What occasion \[authority\] is there for this prayer?” He answered them, “When I enter, I pray that no cause of offence may arise through me; and when I quit, I return thanks for my vocation \[as a teacher of the law\].”

§ 3. Rabbon Gamaliel saith, “Man must daily say the eighteen benedictions.” R. Joshua saith, “a compendium of the eighteen \[benedictions\].” R. Akivah saith, “If the ‏תפלה‎ is fluent in a man's mouth, he says the eighteen \[benedictions\]; if not, he only says a compendium of the eighteen \[benedictions\].”

§ 4. R. Eleazar saith, “If a man turns his prayers into a fixed charge \[or burthen\] they cease to be humble supplications.” R. Joshua saith, “If a man travels in dangerous places, let him say this short prayer, ‘Save, O Lord, thy people, the remnant of Israel; at every stage of their journeying, [^16] let their wants be present before thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hearest prayers.’”

§ 5. If a man rides on an ass, he must dismount: if he cannot dismount, he turns his face towards the Sanctum Sanctorum; and if he cannot turn his face, he is to direct his mind to that most holy place.

§ 6. If he is seated in a ship, or in a cart, or in a waggon \[on a raft\], he directs his mind to the Sanctum Sanctorum.

§ 7. R. Eleazar saith, the ‏מוסף‎ \[additional prayer\], is only to be read in a public congregation. But the sages say, “Whether there be \[a congregation\] or not, \[this prayer must be read\].” R. Jehudah said, in the name \[on the authority\] of R. Eleazar, “In all places where there is a public congregation, single individuals are exempt from praying ‏מוסף‎.”

## Footnotes

[^16]: 6:1 The expression in the original, ‏בכל פרשת העבור‎, is very obscure, and has been variously rendered. According to some, it means “at every cross-road.” According to others, “even when they \[Israel\] turn away and transgress.” The translation we have adopted seems most in accordance with the context.
