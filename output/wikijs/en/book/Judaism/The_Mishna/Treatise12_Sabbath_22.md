### CHAPTER XXII.

§ 1. Should a cask break, sufficient may be saved to serve three meals. The owner may also call to others, “Come and save for yourselves \[whatever you can\];” provided, always, \[that\] no portion of the leakage be \[sponged\] up \[soaked up with a sponge\]. Men must not squeeze fruits, so as to extract the juice; and if it ooze out by itself, it is forbidden \[to use it\]. R. Jehudah saith, "If the fruits are for eating, the juice which oozes out is permitted \[for use\], but if the fruits are for beverage, the juice which oozes out is forbidden \[for use\]. If honey-cakes have been broken on the Sabbath-eve, and the honey oozes out, it is forbidden \[for use\]; but R. Eleazar permits \[its use\].

§ 2. Whatever has been dressed with hot water on the Sabbath-eve may be soaked in hot water on the Sabbath; and whatever has not been dressed with hot water on the Sabbath-eve must only be passed through hot water on the Sabbath; except stale salt fish, \[small salted fishes\], and Spanish ‏קוליס‎; [^170] as the passing these through hot water is their proper dressing \[all the cooking they require\].

§ 3. A man may break open a cask, to eat dry figs out of it; provided always, he does it not with the intention to prepare the cask for subsequent use. He must not pierce the bung-hole of a cask; such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but the sages permit it. \[According to another version, R. José permits it\]. He must not spile a cask \[bore a hole in the side thereof\]: and, if it is spiled, he must not put wax on it, because he \[thereby\] smoothens it down. R. Jehudah said, “Such a case was once brought before R. Jochanan, ben Sachai, at Arob, when he remarked, ‘I doubt whether I ought not to have inflicted a sin-offering on the accused.’”

§ 4. They may put cooked victuals into a cave \[cellar\] to save them; also put good water \[in a vessel\] into water that is not drinkable, to keep it \[the former\] cool: likewise cold water \[in a vessel\], into hot water, to warm \[the former\]. He whose clothes have dropped into the water while on the road, may unhesitatingly go on with them. As soon as he arrives at the outmost court \[of the town or village\] he may spread his clothes in the sun, but not before the people \[publicly\].

§ 5. Whoever bathes in the water of a cavern, or in the hot wells of Tiberias, though he wipe himself with ten napkins, he must not bring them away in his hand; but ten persons wiping themselves with one napkin, their faces, their hands, and their feet, may bring it away in their hands.

§ 6. They may anoint and rub the stomach with the hands, but not so as to get fatigued. They must not brush the body with a flesh brush, or descend into a ‏קורדימה‎; [^171] they must not take an emetic, or stretch the limbs of an infant, or put back a rupture; he who has strained his hand or foot must not pour cold water on it; but he may wash it in the usual way; and if he does get cured he does get cured.
