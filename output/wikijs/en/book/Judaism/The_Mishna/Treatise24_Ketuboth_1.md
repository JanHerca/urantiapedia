### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. A virgin is espoused on the fourth day \[of the week\], a widow on the fifth; because in towns the Bethdin sits twice a week, \[namely\] on the second and on the fifth \[day\], so that should he \[the bridegroom\] have to complain of non-virginity, he \[presents himself\] early \[the next morning\] before the Bethdin.

§ 2. \[If the person espoused is\] a virgin, her Ketubah is two <span id="p242">[<sup><small>p. 242</small></sup>]</span> hundred dinar; \[if\] a widow, \[it is\] a maneh. [^779] A virgin \[who is\] a widow, or divorced, or has performed chalitza, after betrothment \[only, the marriage ceremony not having been completed, or the marriage consummated, in all such cases\] their Ketubah is two hundred dinar, and they are amenable to the accusation of non-virginity. [^780] A proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman, who have been ransomed, converted, or manumitted at less than three years and one day \[old\], their Ketubah is two hundred dinar, and they are amenable to the accusation of non-virginity.

§ 3. A minor, [^781] with whom an adult \[male\] has had carnal intercourse, a nubile maiden who has had such intercourse with a minor, [^782] and \[a virgin\] fractured by accident, [^783] their Ketubah is two hundred dinar. Such is the dictum of R. Meir: but the sages hold \[in the case of a virgin\] fractured by accident \[that\] her Ketubah \[is only a\] maneh.

§ 4. A virgin \[who is\] a widow or divorced, or has performed chalitza after espousals \[only, the ceremony having been completed, but the marriage not consummated, in all such cases\] their Ketubah is a maneh, and they are not amenable to the accusation of non-virginity. A proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman, who have been ransomed, converted, or manumitted at more than three years and one day \[old\], their Ketubah is a maneh, and they are not amenable to the accusation of non-virginity.

§ 5. He who in Judea has partaken \[of the betrothment meal\] at his father-in-law's without \[any\] witness \[present\], cannot prefer an accusation of non-virginity, because he was alone with her [^784] \[the bride\]. A widow, whether she be \[the daughter\] of an Israelite or of a priest has \[always\] her Ketubah \[of\] a maneh. The sacerdotal <span id="p243">[<sup><small>p. 243</small></sup>]</span> Bethdin fixed the Ketubah for a virgin \[of sacerdotal race\] at four hundred zooz, but the sages did not \[interfere to\] prevent them.

§ 6. He who espouses a wife, and discovers she has not her virginity, should she say, “After thou didst betroth me ‏נאנסתי זנסתפחה שדך‎” [^785] while he replies, “No, it is not so, but before I had betrothed thee \[thou hadst lost thy virginity\], consequently my bargain \[with thee\] was concluded in error:” [^786] \[in his case\] R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, “She is worthy of belief;” but R. Joshua saith, “Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered previous to her betrothment, and that she deceived him, unless she adduces proof to \[support her assertion\].”

§ 7. Should she assert, “I have been fractured by accident,” while he replies, “No, thou hast been deflowered by a man,” R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, “She is to be believed;” but R. Joshua saith, “Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered by a man, unless she adduces proof to \[support\] her assertion.”

§ 8. If she is seen conversing \[intimately\] with a man in the street, and being asked, “Who is that man?” she replies, “He is A.B., a priest \[or of legitimate Israelitish descent\],” R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, “She is to be believed;” but R. Joshua saith, “Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered [^787] by a nethin or a bastard, [^788] unless she adduces proof to \[support\] her assertion.”

§ 9. If she is pregnant, and being asked, “by whom?” she replies, “By NN., who is a priest,” R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, “She is to be believed;” [^789] but R. Joshua saith, “Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to be pregnant by a nethin or a bastard, unless she adduces proof to \[support\] her assertion.”

§ 10. R. José said, “It \[once\] happened that a girl went down <span id="p244">[<sup><small>p. 244</small></sup>]</span> to draw water from the fountain, and she was violated \[by a person unknown\].” R. Jochanan ben Nouri decided, “That if the majority of the townsmen were \[of pure descent and\] qualified to intermarry with the sacerdotal race, this girl might be espoused by a priest.”

## Footnotes

[^784]: 242:2 One hundred dinar; the same proportion is observed whatever be the description of coin named in the Ketubah.

[^785]: 242:3 Vide Deut. xxii. 13–21. If sustained it deprives them of their Ketubah.

[^786]: 242:4 A girl less than three years and one day old.

[^787]: 242:5 A boy less than nine years and one day old.

[^788]: 242:6 The expression of the text is ‏מכת עץ‎, one struck by a tree or wood; it means a maiden bruised or fractured \[from any cause other than coition\], so that the signs of virginity have disappeared.

[^789]: 242:7 In Judea the custom was for the father-in-law to make a repast at the time of betrothing, during which bride and bridegroom were left alone. This was done to accustom them to each others society; but the law presumes that he abused the opportunity, and therefore has no right to complain.

[^790]: 243:8 A figurative expression, denoting that her person (which is his possession) has become defiled.

[^791]: 243:9 If she was violated subsequent to the betrothment, she does not forfeit her Ketubah; whereas if it happened previously, her concealing it is held to be a fraud practised upon him, the contract which he concluded in error becomes void, and she forfeits her whole Ketubah.

[^792]: 243:10 A striking instance of the rigid seclusion to be observed by women in the East, and the jealous suspicions to which they are subject.

[^793]: 243:11 Vide Treatise Yebamoth, ch. II., § 4, note 1.

[^794]: 243:12 In which case she and her child—if a daughter—might marry priests, which otherwise they cannot do.
