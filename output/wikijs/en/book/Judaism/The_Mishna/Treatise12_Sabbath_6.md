### CHAPTER VI.

§ 1. Wherewith \[on her person\] may a woman go out? and wherewith may she not go out? [^103] A woman must not go out with linen or woollen laces; nor with the straps on her head, because <span id="p45">[<sup><small>p. 45</small></sup>]</span> she cannot bathe with them on, but must first unfasten them: nor with a frontlet and pendants thereto, [^104] unless sewn to her cap; nor with the lining of the frontlet, into the public reshuth; [^105] nor with a golden \[ornament in the shape of a\] town; nor with a tight gold chain; nor with nose-rings; nor with finger-rings, on which there is no seal; nor with a needle without an eye: but if she has gone out with either of these, she is not guilty \[to bring\] a sin-offering.

§ 2. A man is not to go out with iron-bound sandals, [^106] nor with one \[iron-bound shoe\], unless he has a sore in \[the other\] foot; nor yet with Tephilin; [^107] nor yet with an amulet, unless it be by a distinguished sage; nor with cuirass, helmet, or armour for the legs: but if he has gone out \[with either of these\] he is not guilty \[to bring\] a sin-offering.

§ 3. A woman must not go out with a needle that has an eye; nor with a finger-ring that has a seal on it; nor with a ‏כוליאר‎; [^108] nor with a smelling-bottle, or balm-flask: if she has gone out \[with either of these\] on her person, she is guilty, \[and bound to bring\] a sin-offering. Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but the sages absolve her \[therefrom, as far as regards going out\] with a smelling-bottle or balm-flask.

§ 4. Man must not go out with a sword, nor with a bow, nor with a triangular shield, nor with a round one, nor with a spear; if he has gone out \[with either of these\] he is guilty, \[and bound to bring\] a sin-offering. R. Eleazar saith, “They are ornaments \[becoming\] to him:” but the sages hold, “they are nothing else but a stigma \[unbecoming\], for it is said, ‘They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears unto pruning-books, nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.’” [^109] <span id="p46">[<sup><small>p. 46</small></sup>]</span> Knee-buckles are clean, and a man may go out with them on the Sabbath; stride-chains [^110] are liable to become unclean, and a man must not go out with them on the Sabbath.

§ 5. A woman may go out with plaits of hair, whether of her own hair or of another woman, or of an animal; with frontlet and pendants, if they are sewn fast to the cap; with the lining of a frontlet, and with false-ringlets \[curls\], into the courtyard; with soft wool in her ears, or soft wool in her shoe, or soft wool she has prepared for her menstruation; with a \[grain of\] pepper or \[of\] salt, or with whatever else she \[is accustomed to\] put into her mouth, provided she does not put it \[into her mouth\] especially on the Sabbath; and if she drop it \[out of her mouth on the ground\] she must not put it back \[into her mouth\] again; a false tooth, or a gilt tooth, Rabbi permits \[the going out with\]; but the sages prohibit \[it\].

§ 6. Women may go out with a coin fastened on a swelling in their feet; little girls may go out with laces on, and even with wires in their ears; Arabian women may go out in their large veils, and Median women in their mantillas: so \[indeed\] may any one; but the sages adduce their instances from existing \[and known objects\].

§ 7. A woman may fold up a stone, or a nut, or a coin, in her mantilla, provided she does it not especially on the Sabbath-day.

§ 8. The cripple may go out with his wooden leg: such is the dictum of R. Meir; but R. José prohibits it. If the wooden leg has a hollow receptacle for rags, it is \[liable to become\] unclean; leather crutches \[of a cripple who is lame of both ankles\], are \[liable to become\] unclean from pressure; but he may go out with them on the Sabbath, and \[also\] enter into the outer court \[of the temple\] with them. The chair and crutches \[of one who is paralytic\] are \[liable to become\] unclean from pressure, he must not go out with them on the Sabbath, and he must not enter the outer court \[of the Temple\] with them: ‏אנקטמין‎ [^111] are clean, but he must not go out with them.

§ 9. Boys may go out with their bands, and princes with golden bells: so \[indeed\] may every one, but the sages adduce their instances from things existing \[and known\].

§ 10. It is permitted to go out with the egg of a grasshopper, or <span id="p47">[<sup><small>p. 47</small></sup>]</span> the tooth of a fox, or the nail of one who has been hanged, as medical remedies: such is the dictum of R. Meir; but the sages hold \[according to another version; such is the dictum of R. José, but R. Meir holds\], “That even on the week-day this is prohibited, because of \[its imitating\] the ways of the Amorites.” [^112]

## Footnotes

[^103]: 44:1 The question is, to decide what constitutes ornaments, and, as such, part of her attire, and what is burden.

[^104]: 45:2 In the East, women wear a thin gold plate on their foreheads, with pendants fastened thereto.

[^105]: 45:3 According to some, this restriction applies to the lining only; according to others, to all the articles.

[^106]: 45:4 This prohibition was occasioned by a melancholy accident during the persecution by Hadrian, when some Jews assembled in the synagogue on the Sabbath in defiance of the imperial edict, were disturbed by a sudden noise, and fearing the Romans were upon them, preferred falling by their own hands, and used their iron-bound sandals as the instruments of death.

[^107]: 45:5 Even according to the opinion of those who maintain that tephilin must be used on the Sabbath.

[^108]: 45:6 A diadem, or serpentine kind of head-dress, not generally worn by women, and therefore considered a burden.

[^109]: 45:7 Isa. ii. 4; Mic. iv. 3.

[^110]: 46:8 Small chains used to contract the length of the stride or step. They were the invention of a particular family at Jerusalem, who suffered ill-health, and other inconveniencies from the length and rapidity of their steps.

[^111]: 46:9 Wooden shoes or stilts, used to supply the loss of a limb.

[^112]: 47:10 And, as such, being a reprehensible superstition, prohibited; _vide_ Lev. xviii. 3.
