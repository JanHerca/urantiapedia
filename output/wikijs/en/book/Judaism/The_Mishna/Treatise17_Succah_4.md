### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. The loolab and willow \[to surround the altar, was sometimes used\] on six \[days\], and \[sometimes\] on seven \[days of the festival\]. The hallel and the joyous repasts, \[eating of peace-offerings, took place on\] eight \[days\]. The \[dwelling in the\] succah, and the pouring out water, \[lasted\] seven \[days\], and the pipes \[were played on sometimes\] five, and \[sometimes\] six \[days\].

§ 2. \[In which case was\] the loolab \[used\] seven \[days?\] how? When the first holy day of the festival fell on a Sabbath, the loolab \[was used on\] seven \[days\]; but, \[when the first day of the festival fell on\] any other day \[of the week\] the loolab \[is only used\] six \[days\]. [^393]

§ 3. \[In which case was\] the willow \[used on\] seven \[days?\] How? When the seventh day of the willow happened to fall on a Sabbath, \[the willow was used\] seven \[days\]; but, when the seventh day fell on any other day \[of the week\], the willow was only used six \[days\].

§ 4. How was the command to take the loolab \[fulfilled\] when the first holy day of the festival fell on a Sabbath? \[It was the custom that\] every man brought his loolab to the Temple mount, where it was received by inspectors, who deposited it in a gallery. The elders placed theirs in a \[separate\] chamber; and the people were taught to say, “Whosoever gets hold of my loolab; be it his \[I bestow it on him\] as a gift.” On the \[next\] morning the people came early; the inspectors threw all the loolabs down before them; every man seized on one, and it often happened that they hurt each other \[in the scramble\]. When the Beth Din [^394] saw that people were thus exposed to danger, they decreed that every man was to use his loolab in his own house.

§ 5. How was the command to take the willow \[fulfilled\]? There was a place below Jerusalem called to ‏מוצא‎: [^395] thither the people descended, and gathered drooping willow branches: these they brought and placed at the side of the altar, the tips inclining over it. While this was doing, a blast, a long note, and again a blast were blown. <span id="p139">[<sup><small>p. 139</small></sup>]</span> Every day they made one circuit round the altar, and recited \[the verse\], “‏אנא ה׳ הצליהח נא‎, ‏אנא ה׳ הושיעה נא‎.” R. Jehudah said the words, ‏אני והו הושיצה נא‎ \[were also said\]. On the particular day for using the willows \[the seventh of the festival\] they made seven circuits round the altar. When they withdrew, what did they say? “Beauty is thine, O altar! Beauty is thine, O altar!” R. Eleazar said, \[they also said\] “To God and to thee, O altar! To God and to thee, O altar!” [^396]

§ 6. As they did on the week-days, so they did likewise on the Sabbath; excepting only that they gathered the willow branches on the Sabbath-eve, and put them into golden casks \[filled with water\], that they might not fade. R. Joshua ben Beroka saith, “They fetched branches of palms, and threshed \[beat\] them to pieces at the sides of the altar.” \[According to another version, “on the altar.”\] Thence the day was called “the branch threshing-day.”

§ 7. Directly afterwards the children threw down their loolabs, and eat their citrons.

§ 8. How \[was it that\] the hallel and joyous repasts \[took place on\] eight \[days\]? Because it is deduced that man is bound to recite the hallel, and to enjoy the repasts \[of his peace-offerings\] in honour of the last day of the festival, even as on the preceding days thereof. How \[is it that\] the succah \[is dwelt in\] seven \[days\]? When a man has taken his last meal therein, he is not directly to pull down his succah; but, after noon, he moves the furniture back \[into the house\], in honour of the last day of the festival.

§ 9. How was the pouring out of the water? A golden pitcher, that held three lugs was filled with water from the \[brook\] Siloah. When they came \[with it\] to the water-gate, they blew a blast, a long note, and again a blast. The priest then ascended the stair \[of the altar\], and turned to the left; two silver basins stood there. R. Jehudah saith, “they were of gypsum \[stucco\], but had a dark appearance from the wine.” Each was perforated with a small hole, like a nostril \[at the bottom\]. The one \[for the wine\] somewhat wider, the other \[for the water\] narrower, that both might get empty at once. The one, to the west, \[was used\] for the water; the other, to the east, for the wine: but if the water was poured into the wine basin, or the wine into the water basin, it was legal. R. Jehudah <span id="p140">[<sup><small>p. 140</small></sup>]</span> saith, “They poured out one lug on each of the eight days. To him who poured out the water the people called, ‘Raise thy hand;’ for once it happened that one \[priest charged with this duty\] poured the water over his feet, [^397] and all the people pelted him to death with their citrons.”

§ 10. As they did on the week-days so they did likewise on the Sabbath, except that they fetched the water from Siloah on the Sabbath-eve, in a golden cask that had not been consecrated, and placed it in a chamber; if it was upset, or uncovered, they filled again from the laver. For it was not lawful to bring on the altar, water or wine which had been uncovered.
