### CHAPTER XX.

§ L R. Eleazar saith, "A man may spread a wine-strainer \[over a vessel\] on the festival, and \[when it is so spread\] pour \[wine\] into it on the Sabbath; but the sages hold that they must not spread a wine-strainer \[over a vessel\] on the festival, nor pour into it on the Sabbath; but they may pour \[wine\] into a strainer on the festival.

§ 2. They may pour water on lees, in order to render them thinner; and also strain wine through a cloth or an Egyptian hamper; and pass an egg \[that has been cracked\] through a mustard-strainer. They may also make \[mix\] honey-wine on the Sabbath. R. Jehudah saith, “On the Sabbath \[they may mix it\] in a goblet; on the festival, in a basin; and on the middle-days, in a cask;” but R. Zadock saith, “At all times \[a sufficient quantity may be mixed\], according to \[the number\] of guests \[to be provided for\].”

§ 3. They must not soak laserpitium [^166] in tepid water, but it may be put into vinegar; vetch must not be soaked or crushed, though it may be put into a sieve or a basket; straw for fodder must not be <span id="p65"><sup><small>[ p. 65 ]</small></sup></span> passed through a winnow, nor must it be put on a high \[exposed\] place, that the chaff may fall \[blow\] off; but they may put it into a winnow, and then pour it into the crib.

§ 4. They may cleanse \[the crib\] for a stalled ox, and also push aside the superfluous provender, that it may not get soiled. Such is the dictum of R. Dosa; but the sages prohibit it. They may move the fodder from before one beast to put it before another on the Sabbath.

§ 5. Straw on the bed must not be shaken with the hand, though it may be moved with the whole body; but if it is intended as fodder for beasts, or if a pillow be on it, or a cloth, it may be shaken with the hand. A clothes press, if it belong to \[private\] householders, it is permitted \[to open it, though it must not be used to press with,\] but not if it belong to a laundress: \[indeed\] if it belong to a laundress it must not be touched at all; R. Jehudah saith, “If it \[the clothes press\] was partly opened on the Sabbath-eve, it may be altogether opened and pulled out;” \[according to another version, “and the garments pulled out”\].
