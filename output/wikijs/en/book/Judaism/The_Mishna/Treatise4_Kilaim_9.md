### CHAPTER IX.

§ 1. On the score of kilaim in clothing nothing is prohibited, excepting only woollen with linen; and no garments pollute through leprosy but those made of wool and of flax. The priests, while ministering in the holy Temple, wear no other garments but such as are made of wool or of flax. Camel's wool, \[or hair\], which has been mixed with sheep's-wool, should the larger proportion be of the camel, it is lawful to add flax thereto; but should the larger portion be of the sheep, such addition is prohibited: if the proportions are equal, it is likewise prohibited. Such is also the case where hemp and flax have been mixed together.

§ 2. Chinese silk and floss silk \[i.e. the outward coating of the silk-worm's cocoon or ball, which coating resembles wool\], although not considered as kilaim, are nevertheless prohibited to be worn together, on account of their appearance. Bolsters and pillows are <span id="p31"><sup><small>[ p. 31 ]</small></sup></span> not subject to the rules of kilaim, provided man's flesh do not touch them. Kilaim may not be worn even for an instant, nor may it be put on even over ten other garments, nor yet for the purpose of avoiding oppressive duties.

§ 3. Towels, mantles \[for the rolls of the law\], and bathing cloaks, are not subject to the laws of kilaim. R. Eleazar, however, prohibits them. Barbers' cloths are prohibited on the score of kilaim.

§ 4. Shrouds for the dead, and saddle-cloths of an ass, are not subject to the law of kilaim; but the latter must not be borne on the shoulder, even to carry dung therein.

§ 5. Dealers in clothes may, according to their custom, carry garments of kilaim for sale; but they may not carry them with the intention of protecting themselves therewith in warm weather against the sun, or in wet weather against the rain. Those, however, who are particular \[in the observance of the law\], tie the garments on a stick, and carry them over their shoulders.

§ 6. Those who sew garments \[tailors\], may sew clothes of kilaim in their usual way \[placing the garment on their laps\], but they must not so place it with the intention of protecting themselves therewith, in warm weather against the sun, or in rainy weather against the wet. Those, however, who are particular \[in the observance of the law\], place the garment on the ground to sew it.

§ 7. ‏ברסין‎ \[a kind of woollen counterpane, _Lat_. birrus\], and ‏ברדיסין‎ \[a kind of woollen blanket, _Lat_. bardiacus\], and ‏דלמטיקיון‎ \[_Lat_. dalmatica, or dalmatian cloaks\], and ‏פינון‎ \[_Greek_ πινος, hose made of uncombed wool\], are not to be worn until they have been examined. R. José saith, “that examination is not necessary with those which come from the sea-coast, or are brought from beyond seas,” because the legal presumption is, that they have been made of hemp. Shoes or boots made of skin and lined with felt, are not subject to the law of kilaim.

§ 8. Nothing is prohibited on the score of kilaim but what has been spun and woven; as it is said Deut. xxii. 11, “Thou shalt not wear ‏שעטנז‎, a garment of divers sorts,” \[i.e. that which is hackled, spun, and twisted\]. R. Simeon ben Eleazar saith, “Whosoever wears kilaim deviates from the right path, and causes his heavenly Father also to deviate from him.”

§ 9. It is prohibited to mix felt \[with flax\], because it is made of combed wool; it is also prohibited to put a hem or border of wool to a garment of linen, because it resembles the other \[woven\] part. R. José saith, “It is prohibited to tie a scarlet woollen band \[over a <span id="p32"><sup><small>[ p. 32 ]</small></sup></span> linen shirt\], because it is sewn on before it is tied; also to tie a woollen cord or band to a linen one, to gird one's loins withal, even though there should be a leather strap between \[the two bands\].”

The letters with which weavers and laundresses mark linen \[and other garments\], are subject to the law of kilaim \[so that linen must not be marked with woollen thread; and _vice versa_\]. If a needle \[threaded either with linen or woollen thread\] has been passed once only through a garment \[without drawing it back through another place, thereby forming a stitch\], it causes no connection, and is consequently not kilaim, and it is permitted to withdraw it on the Sabbath-day. But if the needle has been passed through twice, so that both ends of the thread are on the same side \[of the stuff out of which the garment is made\], that is a connection, and whoever withdraws it on the Sabbath-day is guilty. R. Jehudah saith, “it is necessary that the needle should have passed through three times.” A sack and a wicker basket, to which a piece of linen or of woollen is tied, are kilaim \[if sewn together\].
