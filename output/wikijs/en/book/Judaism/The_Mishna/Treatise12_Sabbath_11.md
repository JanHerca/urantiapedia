### CHAPTER XI.

§ 1. Whoever throws \[something\] from a private reshuth into the public reshuth, or from the public reshuth into a private reshuth, is guilty; from one private reshuth into another private reshuth, \[there being\] a public reshuth between the two, R. Akivah pronounces him guilty; but the sages absolve him.

§ 2. How is this to be understood? \[Suppose\] two balconies project \[from the private reshuth of the houses to which they respectively belong\] into the public reshuth, and face each other, whoever reaches \[hands\] or throws any thing out of one into the other, is absolved. If both \[balconies\] be in one row, he who reaches \[hands something out of one into the other\] is guilty, but he who throws \[any thing from one into the other\] is absolved; for such \[reaching or handing\] was \[part of\] the work of the Levites \[in their ministry at the tabernacle, viz.\] two waggons stood next to each other in the public reshuth, and the boards \[of the tabernacle\] they handed from one waggon into the other, but they did not throw them. If a heap of mould \[dug out\] of a pit, or a rock \[stone\], be ten hands high and four wide, whoever takes \[any thing\] away from either, or puts \[any thing\] thereon, is guilty; \[should the size thereof be\] less than this, \[ten hands by four\], he is absolved.

§ 3. If, from \[a distance of\] four amoth, a man throws \[something\] against the wall \[should it hit\] higher than ten hands \[from the ground\], it is as if he threw \[it\] in the air; \[should it hit\] lower than ten hands \[from the ground\], it is as if he threw \[it\] on the ground. He who throws \[any thing\] on the ground, \[to the distance of\] four amoth, is guilty. If he threw \[it\] within the four amoth, but it rolled beyond the four amoth, he is absolved. \[If he threw it\] beyond the four amoth, and \[it\] rolled back again within them, he is guilty.

§ 4. He who throws \[something\] into the sea, \[to the distance of\] four amoth, is absolved. If a pool of water be traversed by a public reshuth \[thoroughfare\], whoever throws \[any thing\] into it \[to the distance of\] four amoth, is guilty. What \[depth\] constitutes a pool? Less than ten hands \[deep\]. Any pool which is \[occasionally\] traversed as a public reshuth \[thoroughfare\], whoever throws \[any thing\] into it \[to the distance of\] four amoth, is guilty.

§ 5. He who throws from the sea to the shore, or from the shore to the sea; from the sea to the ship, or from the ship to the sea, or <span id="p54">[<sup><small>p. 54</small></sup>]</span> from one ship into another, is absolved. If ships are fastened together, \[things\] may be moved \[conveyed\] from one into the other; if they are not fastened together, even though they touch, \[things\] must not be moved \[conveyed\] from one into the other.

§ 6. If a man throws \[something\] and, after it has left his hand, he remembers \[it is Sabbath\], should that \[which he has thrown\] be caught up by any other \[person\], or snapped up by a dog, or should it become ignited \[and burnt in the air\], he \[who has thrown it\] is absolved. Has he thrown \[something\] with intent to wound either man or beast, and remembers \[that it is Sabbath\] before the wound is inflicted, \[as long as the object is not hit\], he is absolved. The rule is, all those who \[when guilty\] are bound to bring a sin offering, do not become guilty, unless \[both\] the beginning and end, \[result of their offence\] be unwittingly \[inadvertently\]. If the beginning be unwittingly and the end wittingly \[premeditated\], or if the beginning be wittingly \[premeditated\], and the end unwittingly \[accidental\] \[in either case\] they \[the offenders\] are absolved; unless \[as has already been stated\], both beginning and end \[result of the offence\] be unwittingly \[inadvertently\] committed.
