### CHAPTER V.

§ 1. Wherewith may \[a man let\] an animal go out? [^91] and wherewith may \[he\] not \[let\] it go out? The camel \[he\] may \[let\] go out with its halter, the she camel with a nose-ring; the Lybian ass with bridle and bit; the horse with its collar; all \[animals\] that wear a collar may go out therewith, and be led thereby; \[in case it, the collar, becomes unclean\] it must be rinsed, and dipped in its place \[without taking it off.\]

§ 2. The ass goes out with its rug \[while it is tied on him\]. He-goats may go out with a leather bandage round their privates; sheep with their tails fastened up or down, and with wrapper; [^92] sire-goats <span id="p44"><sup><small>[ p. 44 ]</small></sup></span> with their udders tied up. R. Jose prohibits all these, excepting the sheep with wrapper. R. Jehudah saith, “She-goats may go out with their udders tied up, if \[this be done\] to dry \[up the milk\], but not if it be done to \[preserve the\] milk.”

§ 3. Wherewith may \[a man\] not \[let\] animals go out? The camel must not go out with a rag tied to its tail, [^93] nor with its legs strapped, [^94] nor with its fore and hind-legs fastened together; [^95] this \[applies\] to all domestic animals. A man must not fasten camels together and lead them, but he may hold the \[different\] ropes in his hand, only \[taking care\] that they do not get twisted. [^96]

§ 4. An ass must not go out with its rug that had not been fastened on \[before the Sabbath\], nor with a bell, although it be muffled, nor with a wooden frame-work round its neck, [^97] nor with a strap to its legs. Hens must not go out with cords [^98] tied on them, nor with straps to their feet. Rams must not go out with go-carts to their tails; [^99] nor sheep with sneezing-wood; [^100] nor calves with a reed-yoke; [^101] nor a cow with the skin of a hedgehog tied to her udders, [^102] nor with a strap between her horns. The cow of R. Eleazar hen Azariah went out \[on the Sabbath\] with a strap between her horns, which was against the consent of the sages.
