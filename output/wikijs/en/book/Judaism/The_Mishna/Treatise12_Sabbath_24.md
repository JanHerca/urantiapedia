### CHAPTER XXIV.

§ 1. He who \[on the Sabbath-eve\] is overtaken by the dusk on the road must give his purse to a heathen. If there be no heathen with him he must put it on the ass. As soon as he arrives at the outmost court \[dwelling of the first town or village he reaches\] he <span id="p69">[<sup><small>p. 69</small></sup>]</span> takes off all such things as may be moved on the Sabbath; as to those things which must not be moved he loosens the cords, that they may fall off by themselves.

§ 2. They may untie bundles of straw for cattle; also to strew green boughs \[stalks for them\], but they must not undo bundles trebly tied. Herbs used as fodder, and carob pods, must not be cut up for cattle, be it large or small \[kine or sheep\]. R. Jehudah permits the cutting up of carob pods for small cattle.

§ 3. A camel must not be crammed \[to fatten it\]; nor yet forced to eat; but the food may be put into its mouth. Calves must not be crammed, but the food may be put into their mouths. Poultry may be fed: water may be poured on bran, but it must not be kneaded. They must not put water before bees, or before pigeons in a dovecot; but they may put \[it\] before geese, and before poultry, and before house pigeons \[tame ones\].

§ 4. Pumpkins may be cut up for cattle, and carrion for dogs. R. Jehudah saith, "If the carrion was not such \[if the beast had not died\] on the Sabbath-eve \[or before\], it must not be cut up; because \[in that case\] it is not \[part\] of what has been provided \[for the necessary consumption of the Sabbath\].

§ 5. A man may annul \[disallow\] vows \[of his wife or daughter\], [^175] on the Sabbath, and consult \[a sage\] as to vows \[relating to objects required\] for the Sabbath. Window light may be shut out by blinds; a piece of stuff may be measured, [^176] and also a ‏מקוה‎. [^177] It happened in the days of R. Zadock's father, and of Abbah Saul, that they closed a window with an earthen vessel, and then tied another vessel to a pole with withies, in order to ascertain whether, in a covered vessel \[that stood on a kennel between two houses\] there was an opening one hand high or not. [^178] Thence we learn that \[in certain cases\] it may become permitted to stop up \[close\], to measure, and to tie, on the Sabbath.
