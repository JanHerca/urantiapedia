### CHAPTER XIV.

§ 1. The eight kinds of vermin mentioned in the law [^145]—whoever catches or wounds one of them, is guilty. As to all other kinds of reptiles, or worms, whoever wounds \[bruises\] them is absolved; whoever catches them, if for use, is guilty; if not for use, is absolved. Whoever catches animals, or birds, that are \[already\] in his possession, is absolved; whoever wounds \[bruises\] them is guilty.

§ 2. Man must not make \[prepare\] brine on the Sabbath; but he may make \[mix\] salt and water wherein to dip his bread, and to put into his food, to season it. R. José observed, “And is not this \[mixture\] brine, whether it be more or less salted? The \[only mixture of\] salt and water which is permitted \[on the Sabbath\], is that in which oil has been previously put, either to the salt or to the water.”

§ 3. It is unlawful to eat Greek hyssop on the Sabbath, because it is not food \[fit\] for healthy \[people\]; but man may eat wild-rosemary, and drink ‏אבוב רועה‎; [^146] man may eat of any \[kind of\] food as medicine, and drink any kind of beverage, except water of ‏דקלים‎, [^147] and ‏כוס עקרים‎, [^148] as these are \[only remedies\] for the jaundice; but a man may drink the _water of Dekalim_ for thirst, and may anoint himself with the oil of _Ikkarim_, but not as a remedy.

§ 4. He who has the toothache must not rinse his teeth with vinegar, but he may wash them as usual \[dip something in vinegar and rub them\], and if he does get cured, he does get cured. He who has pains in his loins, must not rub them with wine or vinegar; he may \[however\] anoint them with \[any kind of\] oil, except rose <span id="p58"><sup><small>[ p. 58 ]</small></sup></span> oil. Princes may anoint \[dress\] their wounds with rose oil, as they are in the habit of so anointing \[themselves\] on week-days. R. Simeon saith, “All Israelites are \[to be considered as\] princes \[in this respect\].”

## Footnotes

[^145]: 57:1 Lev. xi. 29.

[^146]: 57:2 “Bloom of the herds;” it is said to be a plant which grows on a single stem, and is an antidote against all pernicious liquids.

[^147]: 57:3 “Water of trees;” the Talmud explains this designation, by relating that in Palestine there is a spring between two trees, the waters of which have the effect that the first goblet promotes digestion, the second acts as a laxative, and the third as an emetic.

[^148]: 57:4 A mucilage, or ointment, composed of certain pulverised herbs and gum, mixed together in wine.
