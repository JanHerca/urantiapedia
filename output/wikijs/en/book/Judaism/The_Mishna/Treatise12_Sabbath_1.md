### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. The prohibition to carry or convey \[^67] into another\] on the Sabbath, is twofold; which \[according to the decision of the sages\], form four \[prohibitions for him who is\] inside \[of the reshuth\]; and also twofold which \[according to the decision of the sages\], form four \[prohibitions for him who is\] outside \[of the reshuth\]. How is this to be understood? A mendicant stands outside \[of the private property\], and the master of the house inside \[of it\]: [^68] should the mendicant put his hand in \[to the private reshuth\], and \[either\] put \[his wallet\] into the master's hand, or take something out of it \[the master's hand into his own\], and draw his hand back, \[into the public reshuth, in which he is standing\], the mendicant is guilty, but the master of the house is absolved. Should the master stretch out his hand \[into the public reshuth in which the mendicant is standing,\] and put \[his gift\] into the hand of the mendicant, or take \[the wallet\] out of it, and draw his hand back \[into the house or private reshuth in which he is\], the master of the house is guilty, but the mendicant is absolved. Should the mendicant put his hand in, and the master take \[the wallet\] out of it, or put \[his gift\] into it, and the mendicant \[then\] draw his hand out, both are absolved. Should the master stretch out his hand, and the mendicant take \[the gift\] out of it, or put \[his wallet\] into it, both are absolved. [^69]

§ 2. A man is not to sit down to the barber, near the time of ‏מנחה‎ until he has said his prayers; [^70] nor must man \[about that <span id="p38"><sup><small>[ p. 38 ]</small></sup></span> time on the Sabbath-eve\] visit the bath, or the tan-yard; he must not sit down to his meal, nor yet in judgment; but if he have begun \[to do either\] he needs not leave off. \[The study of the Law\] is to be interrupted for the Shemang, but not for the Tephilah. [^71]

§ 3. The tailor must not go out with his needle near dusk \[on the Sabbath-eve\], lest he forget and carry it out with him \[during the Sabbath\]. The scribe \[writer\] is not to go out with his writing-reed \[pen\]; nor must a man cleanse his garments of vermin, or read by candle-light \[on the Sabbath-eve\]. They \[the sages\] have indeed permitted \[that\] a teacher may superintend children, who are reading \[by candle-light\], but he \[himself\] must not read. From the same motive \[to avoid the possible occasion to sin\] a man afflicted with a running issue, must not take his meals with a woman afflicted with the same disease. [^72]

§ 4. The following are among the decisions enacted in the Upper Hall of Hananiah, the son of Hezekiah, the son of Giorion, when they \[the sages\] went thither, and went up to visit him. On that occasion the sages present were counted, and \[the sages of\] the school of Shammai were found to be more numerous than \[those of\] the school of Hillel. On that day eighteen enactments were decreed.

§ 5. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to soak the materials for making ink, or drugs for dying, or vetch \[to feed cattle\] \[on the Sabbath-eve\], unless there be time sufficient to soak it through, during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]: but Beth Hillel permit it.

§ 6. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to put bundles of flax into the oven \[on the Sabbath-eve\], unless there be time sufficient to steam \[dry\] them during the day; nor to put wool into the dye-kettle, unless there be time sufficient for the wool to imbibe the dye during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]: all of which Beth Hillel permit. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to spread \[set\] nets for game, fowl, or fish \[on the Sabbath-eve\], unless there be time sufficient for it to be caught therein during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]: but Beth Hillel permit it.

§ 7. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to sell any thing to a heathen \[on the Sabbath-eve\], or to help him to load, or to load for him, unless there be time sufficient for him to reach a neighbouring <span id="p39"><sup><small>[ p. 39 ]</small></sup></span> town \[or village\] during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]: but Beth Hillel permit it.

§ 8. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to deliver skins to a heathen tanner, or clothes to a heathen laundress \[on the Sabbath-eve\], unless there he time enough for them to be got ready during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]: all of this Beth Hillel permit to be done, while the sun remains above the horizon.

§ 9. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, “It was the custom in my father's house, to deliver white garments to the heathen laundress three days before Sabbath.” \[Both schools\] agree, that it is permitted to put blocks on the oil-press, and the round logs on the wine-press near the coming in of the Sabbath\]. [^73]

§ 10. Neither meat, onions, nor eggs, must be fried \[on the Sabbath-eve\], unless there be time sufficient for them to get quite done during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]. Bread must not be put into the oven towards dusk \[nightfall\] on the Sabbath-eve, nor cakes on the coals, unless there be time enough for the surface to become crusted during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\], R. Eleazar saith \[unless there be time sufficient for\] the bottom to become crusted.

§ 11. It is permitted to put the paschal offering into the oven towards dusk on the Sabbath-eve [^74] And the priests \[in the Temple\] may stir the fire a little in the hearth-room, [^75] but in other halls \[of the Temple\] only if there is time sufficient for the fire to seize on the greater part of the wood. R. Jehudah saith of coals, “if any part of them be ignited \[before the Sabbath come in\].”
