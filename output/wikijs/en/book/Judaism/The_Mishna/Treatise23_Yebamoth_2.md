### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. How is it to be understood that the widow of his brother, who had not lived contemporary with him \[releases her rival\]? When of two \[married\] brothers one dies \[without issue\] and another brother was born after the decease of the first mentioned, and the second \[or surviving\] brother marries by _Yeboom_ his widowed sister-in-law, and dies, then that sister-in-law is released, having been the wife of a brother who had not been contemporary with the \[third, or youngest\] brother. The wife \[widow\] of the second brother is also free, as the rival of the first mentioned, but if the other brother had only promised marriage to her and died, [^665] then the sister-in-law must perform the ceremony of _Chalitzah_, but her brother-in-law may not marry her by _Yeboom_.

§ 2. When of two brothers one dies, and the survivor marries his widow by _Yeboom_, and another \[third\] brother was afterwards born, and the second brother dies, then the widow of the first brother is free, as having been the wife of a brother who had not been contemporary \[with the third, or youngest brother\], and the widow of the second is also free, as the rival of the first mentioned. If he had only promised her marriage and died, the second sister-in-law must perform the ceremony of _Chalitzah_, but the brother-in-law may not marry her; but R. Simeon says, “\[The third brother\] may marry by _Yeboom_ \[in the two last cases\], whichever he likes, or cause either to perform to him the ceremony of _Chalitzah_.”

§ 3. A rule obtains in respect to marriage by _Yeboom_. Every woman whom it is unlawful to marry, by reason of being within the degrees of relationship forbidden to intermarry, may not perform the ceremony of _Chalitzah_, nor can be married by her brother-in-law by _Yeboom_, and all women who cannot be so married, owing to other legal prohibitions, [^666] or on account of holiness of station, must perform the ceremony of _Chalitzah_, but may not be married to the brother-in-law by _Yeboom_. When of two sisters \[who had been married to two brothers\] one only can be legally married \[to a third, or surviving brother\], she is bound either to give _Chalitzah_, or to marry that brother-in-law by _Yeboom_.

§ 4. By legal prohibitions \[to marry as above mentioned\] are meant the secondary degrees of relationship prohibited by the Rabbins to <span id="p204"><sup><small>[ p. 204 ]</small></sup></span> intermarry.—Prohibited to intermarry on account of holiness of station are, a widow to a high priest; a woman who had been divorced, or performed the ceremony of _Chalitzah_, who had \[unlawfully\] been married to an ordinary priest; a person born in adultery, and a daughter of the _Nethinin_ [^667] married to an Israelite, or a daughter of Israel to a _Nethin_, or to one born in adultery.

§ 5. In every case where there is a surviving brother, though of illegitimate origin, the widow of the deceased brother of such a one becomes subject to the law of _Yeboom_; he also possesses all the rights of a brother, except when he is the son of a bondwoman, or of a strange \[i.e. non-Israelite\] woman. In every case where there is a son, [^668] that son releases his father's wife from the obligation of _Yeboom_, and even if illegitimate, is amenable to the penalties of the law against striking or cursing his father; he possesses, moreover, all the rights of a son, except he were the son of a bond-woman, or of a strange \[i.e. non-Israelite\] woman.

§ 6. When a person has given ‏קדושין‎ \[i.e. betrothing\] to one of two sisters, and does no longer know to which of them he gave it, he must give ‏גט‎, i.e. a letter of divorce to each. If he left at his decease one brother only, that brother must cause both \[sisters\] to perform _Chalitzah_ to him. If he left two brothers, one must have _Chalitzah_ performed to him, and the other may marry the sister-in-law by _Yeboom_, but if these brothers had already married the sisters, in anticipation, [^669] they are not to be separated from them.

§ 7. When two men \[who are strangers to each other\] have each of them betrothed one of two sisters, and neither of these men know which sister he has betrothed, then each man must give two _Gets_ \[letters of divorce\] to the sisters. If \[the men\] died, and each left a brother, these brothers must have _Chalitzah_ given to them by both sisters. If one of the men [^670] had one brother, and the other two, in the case of one brother only, he must have the _Chalitzah_ performed by both sisters; and in that of the two brothers, one must have _Chalitzah_ performed to him, and the other brother may marry his brother's widow by _Yeboom_, but if they had already married the sisters in anticipation, [^669] they are not to be separated from them. If <span id="p205"><sup><small>[ p. 205 ]</small></sup></span> each man left two brothers, one brother of each pair must have _Chalitzah_ performed to him by one of the sisters, and the other brother of each pair can then marry by _Yeboom_ one of the sisters released by the _Chalitzah_ performed to the other brother. If two brothers had already in anticipation [^671] received _Chalitzah_ from the sisters, the latter are not to be separated from them.

§ 8. It is proper that the eldest brother should perform the duty of _Yeboom_; yet, if it were done by a younger brother, the marriage is valid. When suspected of carnal intercourse with a bond-woman, or with a non-Israelite woman, he may not marry her, even after \[the first mentioned\] had been manumitted, or \[the last mentioned\] had become a proselyte, but if he did marry \[any of these women\], they shall not be separated; but if a person should be suspected of having had adulterous intercourse with a married woman, who, in consequence, had been separated from her husband judicially, then, even if the said suspected person had already married her, they must be separated.

§ 9. A person who brings to a married woman a _Get_ from her husband, from beyond sea, [^672] and declares that the said document was duly written and signed in his presence, [^673] may not marry that woman. If a person should say to a married woman, “Thy husband is dead,” or, “I have murdered him,” or, “We have murdered him,” such person may not marry that woman; R. Jehudah saith, “If he says, ‘I have murdered him,’ the woman may not marry at all, [^674] but if he said, ‘We have murdered him,’ she may be married.” [^675]

§ 10. A ‏חכם‎ \[i.e. one learned in the Holy Law\] who had declared binding a vow made by a woman against her husband, [^676] may <span id="p206"><sup><small>[ p. 206 ]</small></sup></span> not marry her; but he may do so in case that woman appeared before him at the tribunal, and there expressed her refusal, or performed the ceremony of _Chalitzah;_ and in all the above-mentioned cases, if the men were married at the time \[of the prohibition\], and their wives died since, they may marry the women prohibited to them before; also, in case these women had, meanwhile, been married to others, and were divorced, or had become widows, the females also prohibited to these men, may marry their sons or brothers.

## Footnotes

[^668]: 203:1 Before he consummated the marriage.

[^669]: 203:2 This is explained in the next section.

[^670]: 204:3 _Nethinim_ are the descendants of the Gibeonites, who became proselytes in the time of Joshua.

[^671]: 204:4 Even if illegitimate.

[^674]: 204:5 Of the judicial decision of the tribunal, and without waiting for it.

[^673]: 204:6 Namely, those mentioned in the first proposition.

[^675]: 205:7 Of the judicial decision of the tribunal, and without waiting for it.

[^676]: 205:8 A distant country. (See Treatise Gittin, chap. I.)

[^677]: 205:9 He is bound to make such declaration. (Gittin, chap. I. § 1.)

[^678]: 205:10 Neither to the self-accusing murderer, nor to any other person; because the unsupported evidence of a criminal is not admissible, particularly in this case; when, perhaps, he may have charged himself with an imaginary crime, in order to obtain the woman.

[^679]: 205:11 To others, not the self-accuser. There is, however, a contradiction in this latter part of the Mishna; for whether such a person committed the crime alone, or in conjunction with others, he is, doubtless, equally guilty; and, therefore, why should his evidence be received in the latter case \[and the woman allowed to marry\], and not in the former? It is, therefore, explained to mean, that he said, “I was with those who murdered him, but did not murder him myself.”

[^680]: 205:12 See Note 1, page [7](Treatise1_Berachoth_1#p7).
