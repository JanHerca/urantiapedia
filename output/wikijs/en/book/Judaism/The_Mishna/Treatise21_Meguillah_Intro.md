## XXI. TREATISE MEGUILLAH, OR, OF THE ROLL OF THE BOOK OF ESTHER.

### Introduction.

THIS Treatise, according to its title, treats of the periods appointed for the reading of the book, of the manner in which it is to be written, and read on the feast of lots ‏פורים‎. A considerable part of this Treatise, however, is taken up with matters not immediately connected with the subject of its title, such as laws relating to synagogues, the public readings of the Holy law on various solemn days, &c. and with other matters incidentally mentioned.
