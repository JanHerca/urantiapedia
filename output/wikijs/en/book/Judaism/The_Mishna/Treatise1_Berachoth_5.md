### CHAPTER V.

§ 1. Men are not to stand up and pray, except with profound humility. The pious men of ancient days used to pause a full hour before they began to pray, in order to direct their minds \[hearts\] to the Deity. Though the king salute him he is not to respond \[to the salutation\] and though a serpent wind itself round his heel, he is not to interrupt \[his prayers\].

§ 2. The \[divine\] power of \[causing\] the rain \[to descend\] must be mentioned in \[the benediction for\] the resurrection of the dead. Supplication for rain is to be made in the benediction for the year, and ‏הבדלה‎, \[the distinction between the Sabbath and week day\] in the benediction ‏חונן הדעת‎ \[who graciously bestows knowledge\]. R. Akivah saith the ‏הבדלה‎ is to be said in a fourth benediction by itself. R. Eleazar saith, in the thanksgiving \[‏מודים‎\].

§ 3. He who says in his prayers “Thy mercy extends \[even\] to a bird's nest, or for the good \[which thou doest us\] be thy name remembered,” or he who says twice ‏מודים‎ \[we thank\] is to be silenced. If a man step up to the ark \[as minister to pray for the congregation\] and make a mistake, another shall step up in his stead; nor may he in such a case, decline the office. From whence does he \[the substitute\] begin? From the commencement of the benediction in which his predecessor made the mistake.

§ 4. He who steps up to the ark is not to respond “Amen” after the Cohanim \[priests\], lest his attention become diverted \[from the prayers\]. If no other Cohen be present but himself, he is not to lift up his hands \[to bless the congregation\]. But if he feel quite assured that he can lift up his hands, and then resume \[his prayers\], he is at liberty so to do.

§ 5. If a man prays and makes a mistake, it is a bad omen for him. If he be deputed by a congregation \[minister\], it is a bad omen for his constituents, for a man's deputy is like the man himself. It is related of R. Hanina ben Dosa, that when he prayed for the sick, he would say, “This one will live,” or “Such a one will die.” They \[the sages\] said to him, “By what dost thou know \[it\]?” He said to them, “If my prayer is fluent in my mouth, I know that he is accepted; but if not, I know that he is lost!”
