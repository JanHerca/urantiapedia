### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. Wherein may hot vessels \[saucepans\] be deposited \[to retain <span id="p43"><sup><small>[ p. 43 ]</small></sup></span> the heat\]? And wherein may they not \[be\] deposit\[ed\]? They must not \[be\] deposit\[ed\] in olive- kernels, in dung, in salt, in lime, or in sand (whether wet or dry), nor yet in straw, nor in grape-husks, nor in woolflocks, nor in herbs, while these are wet; but it is permitted to deposit in them should they be dry. It is permitted to deposit \[the vessels or saucepans\] under garments or under fruits \[any kind of grain, &c.\], under pigeon-feathers, or shavings, or under fine flaxen tow; R. Jehudah prohibits fine, but permits coarse \[flaxen tow\].

§ 2. They may \[be\] deposit\[ed, wrapped\] in skins, and removed \[taken out of them again: likewise\] in shorn-wool, but must not be removed \[taken out\] therefrom. How then is man to do? He takes off the lid \[of the vessel or saucepan\] and the wool falls off. R. Eleazar ben Azariah saith, “He inclines the vessel to one side, and takes out \[what he requires\], lest \[were he to remove it\] he cannot put it back again.” [^90] But the sages hold \[that it is permitted to\] take \[the vessel\] out, and \[to\] put \[it\] back again. If man has not covered up \[his vessel or pot\] while yet day \[before the Sabbath comes in\], he must not cover it after dusk; if he have covered it, and it is become uncovered, he is permitted to cover it again. He may fill a pitcher, and place it under a pillow or bolster \[to take the chill off.\]
