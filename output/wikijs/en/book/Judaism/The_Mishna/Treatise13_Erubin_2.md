### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. Inclosures \[partitions\] must be made round wells: \[they must be made of\] four double deal-boards, \[placed at the corners of the well so that the four deal-boards\] appear like eight. Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but R. Meir saith, “Eight \[deal-boards must be used\], which appear \[as if there were\] twelve, \[namely\] four double deal-boards and four single ones; their height must be ten hands, their width six hands, whatever may be their thickness; \[the interspace\] between them \[must not be wider\] than to pass two teams of cattle, each team of three beasts abreast.” Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but R. Jehudah saith, “each team of four beasts abreast,” [^187] that is to say, of cattle yoked together in a team, <span id="p74">[<sup><small>p. 74</small></sup>]</span> but not walking loose \[unyoked\], so that one enters as the other passes out.

§ 2. It is permitted to bring the inclosure quite close to the well; provided always that the head and greater part of the body of a cow \[animal\] be within \[the inclosure\] while it drinks. It \[the inclosure\] may \[likewise\] be placed at some distance from the well, provided that more deal-boards \[be used\].

§ 3. R. Jehudah saith, “\[The greatest distance from the well, at which it is permitted to place an inclosure is\] two beth saah;” [^188] but they \[the sages\] said to him, “\[The size of\] two beth saah is only applicable to a garden or a wood-store, but as for a pen \[for cattle\], or a fold, or a drying \[bleaching\] ground \[behind the house\], or a court \[in front of the house\], even though it be of the size of five beth kur, [^189] yea, even of ten beth kur, it is lawful \[to carry or move things therein on the day of rest\].” It is \[therefore\] permitted to place \[the inclosure\] at any convenient distance \[from the well\], provided that more deal-boards \[be used\].

§ 4. R. Jehudah saith, “If a public thoroughfare interrupts \[passes through\] the inclosure, it must be closed up \[with boards\], at the sides \[towards the thoroughfare\]; but the sages hold, it is not necessary. Whether it be a public cistern, or a public well, or a private well, \[such an inclosure of\] boards must be made for it; but to a private cistern, a partition ten hands high is to be made. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but R. Jehudah ben Babah saith, ”An inclosure of deal-boards must be made only for a public well; for all others \[it is sufficient to\] make a girth \[rope fence\], ten hands high.”

§ 5. Moreover, R. Jehudah ben Babah also said, “If a garden or wood-store be somewhat above seventy amoth square, and is encompassed \[inclosed\] by a wall ten hands high, it is lawful to move \[carry things\] therein; provided always that there is a watch-box, or dwelling \[of some kind within the garden or store\], or that it be close to the town;” but R. Jehudah saith, “Even though there be nothing \[else\] within it than a cistern, or a reservoir, or a cave, it is lawful to move, carry things within it \[the garden or store\].” R. Akivah saith, “Even though there be not one of all these \[objects\] within \[the garden or wood-store\], it is lawful to move \[carry things\] therein \[on the day of rest\], provided it do not measure much above seventy square amoth.” R. Eleazar saith, “If the length \[of such a <span id="p75">[<sup><small>p. 75</small></sup>]</span> garden of wood-store\] exceed its width by even a single amah, it is not permitted to move \[carry things\] therein;” but R. José saith, “Even though its length be twice its width, it is lawful to move \[carry things\] therein.”

§ 6. R. Elai said, “I heard from R. Eleazar, that even though it \[the garden or wood-store\] should be an entire beth kur \[in extent\], it is permitted to move or carry things therein on the day of rest. I also heard from him, that if one of the householders of a court had forgotten, and not \[joined in\] the erub, it is unlawful for him to carry any thing out of, or into, his house; but to them \[the other inmates of the court\] it is permitted \[so to do\]. Moreover, I heard from him, that a man might fully acquit himself of his duty [^190] on the Passover, by using ‏עקרבנין‎; [^191] and I inquired among all his disciples, seeking a companion \[who had likewise heard him pronounce these opinions\], but I could not find \[meet with one\].”
