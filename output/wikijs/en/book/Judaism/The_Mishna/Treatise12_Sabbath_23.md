### CHAPTER XXIII.

§ 1. A man may borrow of his acquaintance jars of wine or of oil, provided he does not say to him, “Lend \[trust\] me;” likewise a woman \[may borrow\] bread from her friends \[acquaintance\]; if he refuses to trust him, he, \[the borrower\] may leave his _Taleth_ \[upper garment as a pledge\] with the lender, and settle his account with him after Sabbath. Thus, likewise, in Jerusalem, if the eve of the passover falls on the Sabbath, a man leaves his _Taleth_ with the vendor, takes his paschal lamb, and settles his account after the holy day,

§ 2. A man may verbally count the number of his guests, and also of his additional dishes \[_hors d’œuvres_\], but he must not do it from a written list. He may let his children and household draw \[cast\] lots at table, \[as to who is to have part of one dish, and who is to have part of another\], provided he does not \[with strangers\] intentionally stake a larger portion against a smaller one, on account of ‏קוביא‎. [^172] <span id="p68"><sup><small>[ p. 68 ]</small></sup></span> They may put lots on the portions of sacrifices on the holy day, but not on the sacrifices of the preceding day.

§ 3. He must not hire labourers on the Sabbath, nor may he commission another to hire them for him. He must not stand \[waiting for\] the dusk at techoom, [^173] in order \[as soon as the Sabbath goes out\] to hire labourers \[beyond the techoom\], or to gather fruit \[beyond it\]; but he may await the nightfall at the techoom, in order to watch \[fruit that is beyond it\]; and, in that case, he may bring fruit back with him. Abbah Saul laid down the rule, “Whatever I am permitted to prepare \[for the coming day\] on the Sabbath, I may get ready for at nightfall.”

§ 4. They may await the nightfall close to the techoom, to forward what is necessary for a bride, and also what is necessary for a corpse, to bring a coffin and shrouds for it. If a heathen has brought mourning pipes \[instruments\] on the Sabbath, an Israelite must not mourn \[play\] thereon, unless they be brought from the vicinity. If a coffin has been made, and a grave dug for him \[a heathen\], an Israelite may be buried therein, but if \[it has been done\] on purpose for an Israelite, he must not at all be buried therein.

§ 5. They may do all that is needful to the corpse \[on the Sabbath\], anoint and wash it, provided they do not strain its limbs. [^174] The pillow may be moved from under its head; it may be put on sand, that it keep the longer \[from putrefaction\]: its jaws may be tied, not to force them closer, but to prevent them dropping lower. In like manner a beam that has been broken \[cracked\] may be upheld \[supported\] by a stool or a bedstead, not that it may again become erect, but that it do not break more. They must not close the eyes of the dead on the Sabbath, nor \[yet\] on the week-day, while he is expiring. Whoever closes the eyes of a dying person the instant he expires, is as if he shed blood \[like a murderer\].
