### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. Should an entry be higher than twenty amoth, \[its height\] must be lessened \[by lowering the cross-beam\]. R. Jehudah saith, “This is not necessary; should it be wider than ten amoth \[its width\] must be lessened; but if it has tine form \[appearance\] of a door \[gate\], even though it be wider than ten amoth, it is not necessary to lessen \[its width\].”

§ 2. To legalize \[the carrying or conveying within\] an entry \[to a place inclosed on three sides\], Beth Shammai hold, “\[that\] a post and a beam \[are required\];” but Beth Hillel hold, “\[that either\] post or beam \[is sufficient\];” R. Eleazar saith, “two posts.” On the authority of R. Ishmael, a disciple stated before R. Akivah “Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel did not differ \[in opinion\] as to an <span id="p72"><sup><small>[ p. 72 ]</small></sup></span> entry less than four amoth wide, \[for they both agreed that\] such \[an entry\] becomes legalized either through a beam or a post.” On what did they differ? \[Respecting\] entries upwards of four amoth wide, and up to ten amoth: of these Beth Shammai hold, “that a post and a beam are required;” while Beth Hillel hold, “\[that either\] post or beam \[is sufficient\].” R. Akivah said, “They differ as to the one and as to the other.”

§ 3. The beam in question must be wide enough to receive an ‏אריח‎, which is half of a brick, three hands in length and in width; it is, however, sufficient that the beam be one hand wide, so as to hold a half brick lengthwise.

§ 4. \[The beam must be\] wide enough to hold a half brick, \[and also\] sound enough to bear one. R. Jehudah saith, “It must be wide \[enough\], even though it be not sound \[enough\].”

§ 5. \[Should the beam\] be of straw or of reed, it is \[in law\] regarded as if it were of metal; should it be crooked \[bent outwards\], it is \[in law\] regarded as if it were straight; should it be cylindrical, it is \[in law\] regarded as if it were square. Whatever \[measures\] three hands in its circumference, holds one hand in width. [^182]

§ 6. The posts in question, must be ten hands high, be their breadth and thickness whatever it may: R. José saith, “Their width must be three hands.”

§ 7. \[Such\] posts may be made out of any thing, even of that which is possessed of life; \[this last, however,\] R. José prohibits. \[A living animal tied on a grave to close it up\] communicates uncleanness \[even after it be removed therefrom\]. R. Meir saith it is clean, “A letter of divorce for a woman may also be written thereon [^183] \[a living animal\];” but R. José, the Galilæan, pronounces it “\[the letter of divorce so written\] null, \[not valid in law\].”

§ 8. Should a caravan encamp in a valley, and a fence be made around it with the cattle's gear, it is lawful to move things within the fence \[on the day of rest\]; provided always that the fence be ten hands high, and the gaps \[open spaces\] therein, do not exceed \[in extent\] the actual fencing. Every gap \[avenue\] which is about ten hands \[wide\], is permitted; for it is considered as a door \[gate\], \[hut gaps which are\] more than ten hands wide are prohibited.

<span id="p73"><sup><small>[ p. 73 ]</small></sup></span>

§ 9. \[The caravan may also be\] fenced round with three ropes, one above the other; provided always there be between each rope less than three hands \[interspace\], and that the measure \[width or thickness\] of the three ropes \[together\] exceed one hand, so that the whole make up \[the\] ten hands.

§ 10. The caravan may also be fenced round with cane-laths; provided always the interspace between cane and cane be less than three hands. \[All these regulations are limited to\] spoken of a caravan \[only\]. Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but the sages maintain, “\[that\] the caravan is \[especially\] spoken of, solely \[in order to adduce an instance\] from that which actually exists.” [^184] Any partition which is not \[constructed on the principle\] of warp and shoot is not a \[lawful\] partition. Such is the dictum of R. José bar Jehudah; but the sages hold, “\[the constructing it according to\] either one of the two \[principles is sufficient\].” Four immunities have been granted \[to warriors\] in a camp: they may bring wood from any place \[without respecting the rights of ownership\]; they need not wash their hands before meals; they may eat of ‏דמאי‎; [^185] and they are absolved from the obligation of erub. [^186]

[^183]: 72:2 Vide Treatise Gittin, chap. II. § 3.

[^184]: 73:3 Consequently, all these rules and regulations apply to the single traveller; who also enjoys the benefit thereof, should he encamp on the day of rest.

[^185]: 73:4 Fruit or corn, respecting which it is doubtful whether the legal dues \[heave-offering\], tithes, &c., have been acquitted or not.

[^186]: 73:5 Combining the different tents which compose the camp.
