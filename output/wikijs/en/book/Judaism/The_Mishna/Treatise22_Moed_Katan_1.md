### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. Dry land may be irrigated on the Moed, [^615] and also during the Sabbatical year, as well from a fountain that is newly sprung forth, as from one that is not newly sprung forth; but they must not irrigate it with rain-water, nor with water \[drawn\] from a deep well; nor may they make \[dig\] trenches \[to hold water\] round vines.

§ 2. R. Eleazar ben Azariah saith, “They must not make \[dig\] a fresh trench \[conduit, or water course\] on the Moed, or during the Sabbatical year.” But the sages hold, that a fresh trench \[water course\] may be dug during the Sabbatical year, and that those \[conduits\] which are choked up, may be repaired on the Moed. They may \[likewise\] repair water reservoirs \[which are\] in the public reshuth, [^616] and cleanse them: They may also repair the roads \[streets\], the market \[public\] places, and the spring-baths. In short, they may do whatever the exigencies of the public \[service\] require. They <span id="p193">[<sup><small>p. 193</small></sup>]</span> may mark \[whitewash\] tombs, [^617] and even send out \[inspectors\] of Kilaim. [^618]

§ 3. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, “They may lead water from tree to tree, provided always the whole orchard be not irrigated; plants which have not imbibed [^619] \[water\] before the Moed, must not be irrigated during the Moed.” [^620] But the sages permit the one and the other.

§ 4. They may \[by means of gins and pit-falls\] catch moles and field-mice in orchards and fields, but they must not \[do this\] in the \[usual\] way, [^621] both on the Moed and during the Sabbatical year. But the sages hold that in an orchard \[the vermin may he caught\] in the \[usual\] way, but that in a corn-field \[it must\] not \[be caught\] in the \[usual\] way. During the Moed they may pile \[loose stones to stop\] a gap [^622] \[in a fence\], but during the Sabbatical year they repair it in the \[ordinary\] way.

§ 5. R. Meir saith, “Priests make the first inspection of the plague \[of leprosy\] in order to relieve \[the patient\], but not to restrict \[him\].” But the sages decide neither to relieve nor to restrict \[in no case is such an inspection to be undertaken during the Moed\]. [^623] R. Meir \[further\] saith, “A man may collect the bones of his father and mother \[during the Moed, to inter them\], because it is a satisfaction to him \[relieves his mind\].” But R. José saith, “It is a grief to him \[afflicts his mind\]. Man is not to excite \[others to mourn\] over his dead, [^624] nor hold a funeral oration for thirty days before the festival.”

<span id="p194">[<sup><small>p. 194</small></sup>]</span>

§ 6. They must not dig graves or burial vaults on the Moed, but they may prepare \[enlarge\] graves \[previously dug\] on the Moed, and also make a washing pit during the Moed, and a coffin in the same court where the corpse lies. \[This, however,\] R. Jehudah prohibits, unless the boards have been \[previously\] provided.

§ 7. They must not espouse wives on the Moed, neither virgins nor widows; nor must they be ‏מיבם‎, [^625] as that \[the espousal\] is a cause of joy to him individually, [^626] but he may receive back his own divorced wife. A woman may prepare her ornaments on the Moed. R. Jehudah saith, “She must not apply lime \[chalk as a cosmetic\], because it \[may\] disfigure her.”

§ 8. An ordinary person \[who is not of the craft\] may sew \[make stitches\] in the \[regular\] way; but the craftsman \[whose trade it is to sew, must only do it\] zigzag \[during the Moed\]. They may twine \[the ropes in the sacking of\] bedsteads. R. José saith, “\[They may\] only tighten \[the ropes\].”

§ 9. They may erect an oven, or a hearth, or a mill, on the Moed \[for the use of the festival\]. R. Jehudah saith, “New millstones must not be chipped.” [^627]

§ 10. A railing \[balustrade\] may be made round a roof, or gallery \[according to the\] workmanship of common men, but not \[according to the\] workmanship of \[regular\] craftsmen. Rents \[in the roof\] may also be closed, and \[then\] smoothened with a roller, [^628] or with hand and foot, but not with a trowel. Should the hinges of the door-frame, or the beam, or the lock \[of the door\], or the key \[thereto\], have been broken, they may be repaired on the Moed, provided always he does not intentionally put off the repairs till the Moed. All \[kinds of\] pickled food [^629] of which he can eat during the Moed, may be pickled.
