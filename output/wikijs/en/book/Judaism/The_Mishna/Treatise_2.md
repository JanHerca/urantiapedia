## II. TREATISE PEAH.

\[Contains laws relating to the corner of the field to be left for the poor (Levit. xxiii. 22, and Deut. xxiv. 19), and generally such laws as relate to the rights of the poor on the soil of the Holy Land.\]

## III. TREATISE DEMAI.

\[Contains laws relating to such agricultural produce in the due liquidation of tithes and heave offerings, of which the payment is doubtful.\]

N.B. It must be remarked, that the Mishna nowhere confines itself to the subject only of which it professes to treat; but that remarks and opinions are occasionally introduced, bearing no reference to the subject which precedes or succeeds them.
