### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. On the evening of \[previous to\] the 14th of Nissan, it is necessary to make search for leaven by the light of a candle; it is not required to search places in which it is not usual to put leaven. Why then was it ordered that two rows \[of barrels\] must be searched? Because it treats there of a warehouse or wine-cellar, in which leaven is sometimes carried. Beth Shammai decide, “that search must be made between two rows of barrels over the whole surface of such a warehouse;” but Beth Hillel say, “It is <span id="p98"><sup><small>[ p. 98 ]</small></sup></span> sufficient to search between the two external rows, which are also the highest.” [^248]

§ 2. It needs not be suspected that a weasel might \[possibly\] have dragged any leaven from one house or place to another; [^249] for if so, the same suspicion will attach to a \[possible\] removal from one court, or even from one city to another, and \[the search\] would thus become an endless task.

§ 3. R. Jehudah says, “It is necessary to search on the evening before the 14th \[of Nissan\], or early on the morning of that day, or at the time \[when all leaven must be removed\];” but the sages say, “If no search has been made on the evening preceding the 14th, it must be done on that day: if omitted on that day, it must be done at the time appointed [^250] \[for the removal of leaven\], and in case it was then also omitted, it must be done afterwards, [^251] and whatever leaven remains, must be kept in a well guarded place, that no further search may become necessary.”

§ 4. R. Meir says, “It is lawful to eat \[leaven on the 14th\] the whole of the first five hours, [^252] and what remains must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour:” but R. Jehudah says, “It is only permitted to eat \[leaven\] the first four hours; it must be abstained from during the whole of the fifth hour; and it must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour.”

§ 5. R. Jehudah also taught, “That formerly, two cakes of thanksgiving-offering which had become desecrated, were exposed on a bench or gallery \[of the Temple\]. Whilst they lay there, all the people did yet eat \[leaven\]: when one was removed, they abstained <span id="p99"><sup><small>[ p. 99 ]</small></sup></span> from eating, but did not burn it; when both were removed, all the people commenced burning \[the leaven\].” Rabbon Gamaliel says, “Non-consecrated things may be eaten during the first four hours; but heave-offering may yet be eaten during the fifth hour: both, however, must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour.”

§ 6. R. Hanina, the Sagan \[chief or principal\] of the priests, says, “The priests did never object to burn flesh which had become unclean in an inferior degree, [^253] with other flesh which had become unclean in the first degree, [^254] although the \[legal\] impurity of the first mentioned was thereby increased.” R. Akivah added to this, and said, “The priests did never object to burn the oil of heave-offering, which had become unclean by being put by an unclean person, who \[however\] had bathed on that day, into \[a metal\] lamp which had come in contact with a dead body, although a higher degree of impurity had thus been added to its former impurity.”

§ 7. R. Meir says, “We learn from their words, that it is lawful, on account of the Passover, to burn clean heave-offering \[of leaven\] with that which has become unclean;” but R. Jose said to him, “This is not a \[true\] inference;” R. Eleazar and R. Joshua agree, however, that it is necessary to burn each separately. Wherein do they differ? Concerning things whose uncleanliness is doubtful, and things which are certainly unclean; for R. Eleazar says, “Each of these must be burned separately;” but R. Joshua says, “They may be burned together.”

## Footnotes

[^248]: 98:1 This is variously explained; the plainest exposition seems to be the following:—supposing 100 barrels to be piled up one on the other, in a cellar or warehouse, in ten rows of ten barrels each; according to Beth Shammai, the front and top rows must be searched; but Beth Hillel consider it sufficient to search between the two external rows (i.e. those in a perpendicular position), in the first only.

[^249]: 98:2 From a place that has not been searched to one that has.

[^250]: 98:3 The word ‏מועד‎ is here rendered according to Rashi; others have explained it in its usual sense, namely, “festival.”

[^251]: 98:4 After the search has been made to serve for the consumption of the family, between that time and the period when all leaven must be burned, or otherwise removed.

[^252]: 98:5 That is, Till eleven o'clock. To reduce the rabbinical hours to our modern computation of time, add six to the hours mentioned in the Mishna.

[^253]: 99:6 That is, the second degree of impurity.

[^254]: 99:7 This, and the following section, can only be properly understood by a knowledge of the laws laid down on this subject in Seder Taharot.
