### CHAPTER XII.

§ 1. He who builds, how much must he build to become guilty? Whoever builds at all \[be it ever so little\], whoever chops a stone, strikes with a hammer, or uses a plane, or bores a hole; \[whosoever\] at all \[does either of these\] is guilty. The rule is, whosoever does any work, which is lasting and durable, [^138] on the Sabbath, is guilty. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "He \[likewise is guilty\] who strikes with a hammer on an anvil, because it appears as if he prepared \[or finished off\] work.

§ 2. Whoever ploughs at all, or weeds, or clears \[away parasite branches; whoever\] at all \[does either of these\], is guilty. Whoever gathers wood, if to \[clear\], improve \[the\] ground, any quantity, \[however small\]; if to burn, sufficient to boil a light egg. Whoever gathers herbs, if to \[clear\], improve the ground, any quantity, \[however small\]; if for \[feeding\] a beast, sufficient for a kid's mouthful.

§ 3. Whoever writes two letters, whether with his right or with <span id="p55">[<sup><small>p. 55</small></sup>]</span> his left hand, whether the one letter \[twice\], or two \[different\] letters, or with different inks, in any language \[or character\], is guilty. R. José saith, “The writing of two letters was prohibited, solely because \[they may serve\] to mark \[withal\]; for the boards of the tabernacle were thus lettered, to know how to match them.” Rabbi saith, "We find short names, \[which are abbreviations\] of larger ones; as ‏שם‎ \[Sam or Sim\], from Samuel or Simeon; ‏נח‎ \[Noah\], from Nahor; ‏גן‎ \[Dan\], from Daniel; ‏גד‎ \[Gad\], from Gadiel.

§ 4. Whoever, on one occasion, unwittingly \[off-hand at once\] writes two letters, is guilty; whether he write with ink, or paint, or ruddle, or gum, or vitriol, or any \[other\] substance that leaves a \[lasting\] mark. \[Moreover, whoever writes\] on the two \[angles forming\] corner walls, or on two tablets \[leaves\] of an account-book, [^139] so that the two correspond, [^140] is guilty. Whoever writes on his \[own\] flesh, is guilty. Whoever scratches \[alphabetical characters\] on his own flesh, R Eleazar \[pronounces\] bound to bring a sin-offering; but R. Joshua absolves him.

§ 5. Whoever writes with \[any kind of dark\] beverage \[liquid\], or with the juice of fruit, or with dust from the road, or with writing sand, or with any \[other\] substance which is not durable, is absolved; \[whoever writes\] with the back of his hand, or his foot, or his mouth, or his elbow, or if he writes \[adds\] one letter to writing \[which is already written\], or writes over writing; \[moreover\], if he intended to write \[the letter\] ‏ח‎, but actually wrote two ‏ז‎, \[or wrote\] one \[letter\] on the ground, and one on the boards \[partition\], or wrote on two walls of the house, or on two leaves of an account-book, which do not correspond \[cannot be joined\], so that the writing may be read \[as a whole\]; \[whoever does either of these\] is absolved. Whoever writes one letter of notaricon [^141] is, by R. Joshua ben Bethera, pronounced guilty; but the sages absolve him.

§ 6. Whoever unwittingly writes two letters on two \[different\] occasions, \[as\], one in the morning, and one towards evening, is, by Rabbon Gamaliel, pronounced guilty; but the sages absolve him.
