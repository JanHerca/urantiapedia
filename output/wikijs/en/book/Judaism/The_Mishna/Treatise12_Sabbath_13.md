### CHAPTER XIII.

§ 1. R. Eleazar saith, “Whoever weaves three threads at the \[first\] beginning \[of a weft\], or one thread while the weft is in progress, is guilty;” but the sages decide, “that whether at the first beginning or end \[of a weft\] the prescribed quantity is two threads.”

§ 2. Whoever ties two threads, whether in the warp or in the shoot, or in a fine or coarse sieve, or in a basket, is guilty. \[Moreover\], he who sews two stitches, or tears, with intent to sew two stitches, \[is guilty\].

§ 3. Whoever tears something in a rage, or at a death, and all who in a passion spoil \[or destroy\], are absolved. Whoever spoils \[breaks\] in order to repair the prescribed quantity, \[which decides his being guilty\], is \[guilty\] according to the \[extent of the necessary\] repairs.

§ 4. The prescribed quantity of wool, washed, carded, dyed, or spun, is that of a double sit; [^142] and, in the weaving of two threads, the prescribed quantity is that of one sit in width.

§ 5. R Jehudah saith, “Whoever hunts a bird into a cage, or a deer into a house, is guilty.” The sages decide, “a bird into a cage, a deer into a house, a court, or an inclosure for animals.” [^143] R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, “Not all inclosures are alike.” The rule is, when the capture is incomplete, he is absolved; but when the capture is not incomplete he is guilty. The meaning is, whatsoever must be chased a second time renders guilty; whatsoever is completely in a man's power does not render guilty.

§ 6. If a stag enter a house, and one man shuts him in, he is guilty; if two shut him in, they are absolved; if one man is not able to shut him in, and \[therefore\] two shut him in, they are guilty. [^144] R. Simeon absolves them.

§ 7. If one man places himself in the door \[entry, to prevent the deer from getting out again\], but does not \[completely\] fill it, and a second person places \[himself next to him\], and does fill it, the second is guilty. If the first places himself in the door \[entry\], and fills it, and a second person comes and places himself at his side, <span id="p57"><sup><small>[ p. 57 ]</small></sup></span> although the first should afterwards get up and go away \[leaving the second in the entry\], the first is guilty, and the second is absolved. For what is this like? Like as if he had locked his house to secure his property, and a stag is found secured within it.
