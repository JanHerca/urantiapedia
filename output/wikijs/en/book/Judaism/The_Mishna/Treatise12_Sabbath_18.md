### CHAPTER XVIII.

§ 1. Man may move even four or five kupoth [^157] of straw or grain \[to make room\] for guests, or to enable disciples to obtain instruction in the law; but \[he must\] not \[move\] an entire store. \[The following articles\] may \[likewise\] be removed: clean heave-offering, [^158] doubtful fruit, [^159] first tithes, of which the heave-offering has been taken, second tithes, and consecrated things which have been redeemed, and dried broad-beans \[as these last\] are food for the \[‏עניים‎\] poor. \[According to another version (‏עזיים‎) goats.\] But it is not lawful to move ‏טבל‎, [^160] nor first-tithes of which the heave-offering has not been taken; nor second-tithes, nor consecrated things which have not been redeemed; nor yet arum, [^161] nor mustard. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel permits arum to be moved, as it is food for \[tame\] ravens.

§ 2. Bundles of straw, bundles of stalks, and bundles of reeds, if intended as fodder for cattle, may be moved; if not, they must not be moved. A basket may be set on end for chickens to climb up and down on; a runaway hen may be chased back \[home\] again; calves and young asses may be walked \[to and fro to take exercise\] in the public reshuth; a woman may also walk her child. R. Jehudah saith, “When \[may she do this\]? If it \[the child\] lift up one \[leg\] as it sets the other down; but if it trails \[its leg behind\] it is prohibited \[for the mother\] to walk \[lead\] her child, \[on the Sabbath\].”

§ 3. A man must not deliver \[of its young\] an animal that calves on the festival; but he may \[otherwise\] support \[assist\] it. \[If\] a woman is to be delivered on the Sabbath, the midwife must be called in to her from one place to another. The Sabbath may be violated for her sake; the navel-string is to be tied; R. José saith, “it may also be cut.” Whatever is necessary for \[appertains to\] circumcision, may be done on the Sabbath.
