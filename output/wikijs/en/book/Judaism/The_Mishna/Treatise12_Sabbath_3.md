### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. On a double hearth \[range\], [^86] cooked victuals may be put \[shortly before the Sabbath\], if it be heated with stubble or brushwood; \[but if it be heated\] with olive-kernels or wood, they must not put \[victuals thereon\], until \[the lower compartment be\] cleaned out, or covered with ashes. Beth Shammai hold \[that\] warm water \[only\], but not cooked victuals \[may be placed on a hearth or range so heated\]; but Beth Hillel hold, that \[both\] warm water and cooked victuals \[may be placed thereon\]. Beth Shammai hold that they \[may\] take \[any thing\] off \[the hearth\], but \[must\] not put \[it\] back \[thereon\]: but Beth Hillel hold that they may also put \[it\] back.

§ 2. If an oven is heated with stubble or brushwood, nothing must be put either into it or at the top of it. A single hearth which has been heated with stubble or with brushwood, is \[considered\] like a double one; but \[if heated\] with olive-kernels or wood, it is \[considered\] like an oven.

§ 3. An egg must not be put at the side of a hot kettle \[on the Sabbath\], that it become settled \[done\], nor must it be wrapped in <span id="p42"><sup><small>[ p. 42 ]</small></sup></span> hot cloths \[with that intention\], nor must it be put into hot sand, or road-\[side\] dust, that it \[the egg\] be roasted \[by the heat of the sun.\]

§ 4. It once happened that the inhabitants of Tiberias carried a pipe of cold water through an arm \[streamlet\] of their hot-well; but the sages explained to them that on the Sabbath. \[this water\] like any \[other that had been\] heated on the Sabbath-day, is prohibited, either for washing or drinking; and that on festivals \[this water\] like any \[other that had been\] heated on the festival, is prohibited for washing, but permitted for drinking. A ‏מוליאר‎ [^87] that has been cleansed of coals \[it is lawful to\] drink out of \[on the Sabbath\]; an ‏אנטיכי‎ [^88] even though it has been cleansed of coals \[it is\] not lawful \[to drink out of\].

§ 5. \[Into the kettle of\] hot water, which has been removed \[from the fire\], man must not pour \[a small quantity of\] cold water that it get warm, but he may pour cold water into a kettle or goblet of warm water, to make that tepid. [^89] Into a pot or kettle which has been moved \[from the fire\] boiling, he must not put spice; but he may put \[spice to the warm victuals\] in a dish or on a plate. R. Jehudah saith, “Into all \[kinds of vessels\] he may put spice, except into \[such food\] things as contain vinegar or bran.”

§ 6. It is not lawful to put a vessel underneath a lamp to catch the oil \[that drops\], but if it has been \[so\] put while yet day \[before the Sabbath come in\], it is permitted to let it remain; \[but the oil caught therein\] no use must be made of, as it is not \[part\] of what was prepared \[for the consumption of the Sabbath\]. A new lamp may be moved \[from one place to another\], but not an old one \[that has already been used\]. R. José saith, “All lamps may be moved, except such as are alight for the Sabbath.” A vessel may be placed under a lamp to catch the sparks, but no water must be put therein, as that extinguishes.
