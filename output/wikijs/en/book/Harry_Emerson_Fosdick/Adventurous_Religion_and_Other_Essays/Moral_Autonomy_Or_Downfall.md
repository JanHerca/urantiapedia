## I

<span id="p15">[<sup><small>p. 15</small></sup>]</span>

An alert and spirited reviewer, himself a scientist, recently laid violent hands on Professor J. Arthur Thomson’s new book, Science and Religion. What bothered him was not so much that the biologist of Aberdeen leaves the door wide open to the possibility of intelligent religious faith; he was vexed that Professor Thomson in particular, or anybodj'^ in general, should desire religious faith at all and waste time upon it. He had gone past discussing the credibility of religion and was skeptical of its desirability. Why, he asked, should anybody want to believe in God?

Typical as this is of certain limited areas of thought in the new generation, it illustrates the disastrous separation that has taken place between religion and life. Believers must expect, and should be prepared to meet, as their forefathers always have met, antagonists who doubt the truth of religion. But when men <span id="p16">[<sup><small>p. 16</small></sup>]</span> begin doubting the usefulness, the desirability, the practical need of religion, the church should engage in anxious self-examination. To cause that something calamitous must have happened in the current presentation of religion’s meaning.

That something calamitous has happened seems plain. It is indicated not so much in learned reviews and university lectures as in popular attitudes. The wide-spread neglect of institutional religion, the patent endeavor of multitudes of people, unconscious of serious loss, to get on without any religion at aU, the wistful sense of spiritual vacancy wanting to be filled but last of all thinking of a church as the place to fill it, the idealistic movements, among the noblest of our time, whose associations with religion are remote and tenuous if they exist at all — ^these and other elements in the present situation bear witness to a crucial fact : contemporary human life, on the one side, and contemporary religion, on the other, have been drifting apart.

In this fact lies one explanation of the present turmoil in the churches. The restlessness of maladaptation is making them very unhappy. <span id="p17">[<sup><small>p. 17</small></sup>]</span> Conscious of possessing spiritual goods necessary to man’s fullest life, they are baffled by inlierited forms of thought and institution which have lost touch with the vital interests and habitual thinking of the people. Feeling thus out of joint with their time, some accuse the new generation of being sons of Belial, some urge the reformation of the church, some blame education and cry out against the colleges, some bewail the disturbance of old doctrines which used to function as vehicles of the spirit and, presumably, should do so still, some invent new religions to slake a thirst which nothing but religion satisfies, and in general the painful symptoms of impending change afflict the house of God. And behind all symptoms is the basic fact that religion and life have been drifting apart.

This situation, attended by many obvious perils to the churches, has one outstanding and disastrous consequence: it makes religion seem utterly negligible. That some should be skeptical, denying all truth to religion, is to be expected; that some should be carnal hedonists, declining the moral ideals of religion, is an immemorial difficulty; but that many should refuse <span id="p18">[<sup><small>p. 18</small></sup>]</span> to credit religion with any desirable contribution to life is a staggering fact.

To folk who know religion in its depths, the one most certain truth about it is its indispensable gift to rich and radiant living. That contribution is the ultimate test of any religion and of its power to survive. The churches must face that test to-day with searching of heart if they would regain contact with their generation and make their message seem worthy of heed. Whatever in religion makes for rich and radiant living is worth while. Whatever in religion is alien from that, or negligible in its ejafect upon it, is of no account. All doctrines and institutions of religion must ultimately meet this test, no matter how bitterly ecclesiastics bewail lost icons and taboos, abandoned shibboleths and polities. Two questions to-day face every proposition and custom of religion: first, is it intelligently defensible; second, does it contribute to man’s abundant life?

## II

This intimate relationship between healthy religion and wholesome living may be seen in <span id="p19">[<sup><small>p. 19</small></sup>]</span> our present crying need of moral autonomy in our eitizensbip. We have gone about as far in modern civibzation as we can go, trying to approach the human problem from without, and unless we can approach the human problem from within, we are headed toward perilous days. The influence of the environmentalists has been tremendous. To them nothing has seemed so important as setting human life in a matrix of fortunate circumstance. Theoretical science has revealed the large effect of environment on all developing organisms, and applied science has incalculably increased our power to alter environments to suit our human purposes. More and more on this basis we have been endeavoring to solve the human problem from without.

To-day critical and sometimes withering doubt falls, not on the necessity of this procedure, but on its adequacy. The eugenists know that the human problem is finally insoluble unless we start with it before environment has had a chance to play upon the individual at aU. We are what we are, they say, more because of our heritage from within than because of our environment from without.

<span id="p20">[<sup><small>p. 20</small></sup>]</span>

To this balancing of the scales against the too-great weight of the environmentalists, the man of spiritual insight must also bring his contribution. The restoration of the inward approach to the control of life has to-day become in America a public question of the first magnitude. The legalists have made it such. They also, and often with wild exaggeration, have approached life from without. The merest tyro begins to understand that the endeavor to make people good by law is being carried to ridiculous extremes. For a generation and more our legislatures have been acting under the apparent assumption that the springs of righteousness in the community are not inward but governmental, not spiritual but externally regulative, and the assumption is bringing poor results.

This protest implies no doubt of the necessity and moral value of law. We pay a heavy price for our complex civilization in that the more complicated it becomes the more laws must be enforced. As with traffic on the streets, so with life — the more congested it is the more rules must be obeyed. But just because we must have laws, and unhappily must have more <span id="p21">[<sup><small>p. 21</small></sup>]</span> of them the more complicated civilization grows, the more we need to guard ourselves against leaning on law for the safety and progress of society.

Who can have lived during these last few years, with laws piled on laws, governing every aspect of man’s life, while all the time lawlessness grows more rampant underneath, without perceiving that not law but moral autonomy — the desire and capacity of the individual citizen to govern himself from within — ^is the real underpinning of the state and that, lacking this, the whole superstructure of legalism may yet come clattering in ruin about our ears? If we cannot secure citizens willing and able to govern themselves from within, we shall not have citizens whom we can govern from without.

If America should ever fail, if after the splendor of her start and the imparaUeled marvel of her opportunity she should fall on ruin, the trouble would not be lack of external, legal regulation. The trouble would be lack of moral autonomy — ^the failure in individual citizens of those motives, sanctions, convictions, faiths, and ideals which enable a man to govern <span id="p22">[<sup><small>p. 22</small></sup>]</span> himself from within. The profoimdest needs of America are real education and real religion — ^the two forces that approach life not from without but from within.

This means no slurring of the importance of rectified environment and just laws, no neglect of the crucial significance of scientific eugenics applied to the problem of population. These things we ought to do and not to leave the other undone. For these things alone, however weU performed, would leave the human problem not only unsolved but, it may be, more bedeviled than it was before, unless the moral autonomy of the individual were established with ever-increasing capacity to meet the increased strain of modern life. The pillar arotmd which the blind Samson of our new science, applied to material aims, may yet get his arms is our power of inward spiritual self-direction, and when that goes everything else that we have buOt will go with it.

## III

Our fathers used to phrase this inward approach to life in terms of the soul: its sin, its <span id="p23">[<sup><small>p. 23</small></sup>]</span> salvation, and its destiny. Their hymns concerned —

> A never-dying soul to sare.
> And fit it for the sky.

For the most part, modern congregations sing such eighteenth-century words without the vivid and picturesque meanings which the words conveyed to eighteenth-century minds. We are not otherworldly in our aspirations. We expect to die, hut we spend little time thinking of it, and fitting a never-dying soul for the sky is certainly not the way in which a typical member of the yoimger generation would describe his major and dominant ambition.

Nevertheless, modern as we are, and plainly requiring other frameworks of thought and modes of expression to make genuinely articulate our spiritual experiences and aspirations, we need not suppose that by any modernity we have evaded the necessity of an inward approach to the problem of living. If we dislike eighteenth-centmy hymns we may have twentieth-century substitutes, as in Edna St. Vincent Millay’s Renascence:

<span id="p24">[<sup><small>p. 24</small></sup>]</span>

> The world stands out on either side
> No wider than the heart is wide;
> Above the world is stretched the sky, —
> No higher than the soul is high.
> The heart can push the sea and land
> Farther away on either hand ;
> The soul can split the sky in two.
> And let the face of God shine through.
> But East and West wiU pinch the heart
> That can not keep them pushed apart;
> And he whose soul is flat — the sky
> Will cave in on him by and by.

If it pleases us better, we may speak about the soul in such terms as these and leave behind us the eighteenth-century’s otherworldliness. But we still are dealing with the same agelong, fundamental, human problem — ^the successful handling of a man’s own life from within.

Here is the real line of discrimination between the realm of physical science on the one side and of religion on the other. The task of physical science is to master the latent resources of the external universe. Magnificent have been its achievements there. Still more splendid wrill they be. But we could get along for many years with no more accomplishments in <span id="p25">[<sup><small>p. 25</small></sup>]</span> that realm than we already have. We could muddle through with only as much steam and electricity under our control as we have now. What we cannot do is to muddle through much farther in Western civilization with no more control than we now have over the inward lives of men. The wild, physical universe — ^we will tame that yet ! We will harness its forces, saying to this one. Go, and it will go, and to that one. Come, and it will come. But the inner world of man’s life, with its ignorance, prejudice, bitterness, pessimism, its instability, waywardness, passion, and sin — shall we ever bring that into captivity to the obedience of Christ? Shall we ever make that wholesome, intelligent, reverent, unselfish, and brotherly?

That is the deepest single question in civilization to-day.

## IV

To suppose that this central spiritual task of human life can be achieved on an irreligious basis seems to me a contradiction in terms. The task itself in its very nature is essentially religious. This is what religion means. To be <span id="p26">[<sup><small>p. 26</small></sup>]</span> sure, it is possible to define religion in terms of early stages in its evolution, to identify it with magic or superstitious reverence for taboos, or an historic stage of doctrinal development; and some indulge in that cheap and easy method of defamation. They might as well scoff at astronomy because it once was astrology, or outlaw chemistry because it came from alchemy. Religion, like every other interest in human life, dealing with reality and growing in the apprehension of it, has shown endless capacity for change, evolving as other human activities of mind and spirit evolve, never to be adequately described in terms of its chrysalis when at last it has gotten wings to fly.

Religion at its best has supplied — ^and it can now supply — ^the motives, faiths, insights, hopes, convictions by which men inwardly come to terms with themselves, gain spiritual ascendency over their baser elements, achieve peace and power, and come off more than conquerors. Religion means the achievement of such a view of life, its source, its meaning, its destiny, such personal relationship, moreover, with the Spirit from whom our spirits come, and such fellowship with ourselves, with other <span id="p27">[<sup><small>p. 27</small></sup>]</span> people, and with God as will furnish inward spiritual dynamic for radiant and triumphant living.

To tell men that they are accidental collocations of physical atoms; that what they think is spirit in them is as much a chemico-mechanical product as phosphorescence on the sea and essentially as transient; that they are the passive results of heredity and environment, and by them are as mechanically determined as is a locomotive by its steam pressure and its rails ; that they have no spiritual source, no abiding spiritual meaning, no spiritual destiny, and no control over their own character or development — ^that is sheer irreligion and not only can it not solve the problem of which we have been speakmg, but if it were logical (as fortunately it seldom is) it would not even try. It would leave the matter helplessly to be decided by the blind action of physical forces that are supposed automatically to control the universe and us within it.

By every step that a man moves away from tins thorou^going irreligion toward interest in, serious concern about, and practical endeavor to deal with the problem of moral autonomy, <span id="p28">[<sup><small>p. 28</small></sup>]</span> he comes that much nearer to religion. If he undertakes the problem earnestly he is thereby in the thick of religion. He already is discovering in human life spiritual values which he wishes to conserve, for the beautifying and purifying of which he is seriously concerned, without whose development and effective dominance he sees no hope for society. He already is thinking of the central meaning of life in terms, not of the external world, but of the internal world, with its possibilities of goodness, truth, and beauty. That in itself is in so far religious. And if, as some of us feel sure, we not only intelligently may, but intelligently must go farther to find in this intemal world of spirit the revelation of the Reality, whose we are, and whom we may find liberty in serving, we cannot long travel this road of inward approach to life before we fin d ourselves “not far from the kingdom of God.”

Coming at life by way of a merely inherited religion is a played-out procedure for most thoughtful people. But coming at religion by way of life, and a deep desire inwardly to live it well, is a procedure full of endless promise. As soon as one strikes that road he finds him <span id="p29">[<sup><small>p. 29</small></sup>]</span> self in the highway where the seers and prophets of the spirit always have walked and, above all, he can distinguish clearly there the footsteps of the Son of man.

This desire for inward peace and power, overflowing in useful and radiant living, is humanity’s profoundest characteristic. It is everywhere to-day alive and urgent. And the churches at the center of their Gospel have the means of its satisfaction. Why will they so generally insist on specializing in irrelevancies? Why so often, like football players who continue a scrimmage after the ball has been carried far down the field, do they keep up a melee at a point from which the vital needs of their generation long since have departed?
