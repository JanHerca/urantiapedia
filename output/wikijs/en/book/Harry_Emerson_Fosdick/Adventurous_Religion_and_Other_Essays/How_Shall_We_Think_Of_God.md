## I

The existence of God is a consuming concern of religion, biit an astonishing amount of religious propaganda is carried on with apparent carelessness about what people mean by him. A few years ago one of our leading psychologists conducted an investigation into the ways his students thought about God and some of the answers he received were startling. “I think of him as real, actual skin and blood and bones, something we shall see with our eyes some day, no matter what lives we live on earth”; “I have always pictured him according to a description in Paradise Lost as seated upon a throne, while around are angels playing on harps and singing hynans”; “I think of God as having bodily form and being much larger than the average man. He has a radiant countenance beaming with love and compassion. He is erect and upright, fearless and brave.” Ass one considers such images of God in the minds of educated youths, presumably brought <span id="p60">[<sup><small>p. 60</small></sup>]</span> up in our Sunday schools and churches, one must acknowledge that believing in God without considering how one shall picture him is deplorably unsatisfactory. Moreover, this endeavor to have faith m God without knowing what you mean by him is an impossible procedure for increasing numbers of people. They are not atheists nor even agnostics; they have always supposed that they believed in God, but they are facing now a bewildering question: what does the word mean? what is God like? how can he be imagined? Many such inquirers come to a minister’s confessional wondering what picture he has in his mind when on Sunday he preaches about ‘God.’

The pressure of this diflSculty is in part explained by the collapse of the old imaginative frameworks in which our fathers commonly thought of God. What a cozy stage was furnished by the old cosmology, with its flat earth and its close, convenient heaven, on whidi the religious imagination could picture its gods, their entrances and exits! Centuries will probably pass before religious symbolism fully is transferred to the setting of the new astronomy. The premillennialists, for example, by <span id="p61">[<sup><small>p. 61</small></sup>]</span> hundreds of thousands in the United States, are awaiting the physical return of J esus from the sky, to set up his kingdom on the earth. To enforce that belief and expectation as an integral part of Christian orthodoxy is one objective of a large section of the fundamentalists. Nothing can exceed the zeal with which they hold that the world will grow continually worse until at last upon the clouds the Lord himself wiU come to begin his millennial reign.  • i,i

That expectation depends for its picturable ness upon the old astronomy. Granted a flat earth with heaven a little way above, granted Jesus’ resurrection conceived in terms of flesh and his ascension conceived as physical levitation through the clouds to the divine dwellmg in the sky, granted the picture of him there “at the right hand of God” and, in that case, his return on the clouds by the same route he went is as easily imaginable as the retinn of a friend from San Francisco. That was the cosmological picture in which the expectation first arose. That is the cosmological picture which sustained it for centuries. The marvel is not that it should have existed from the days of the <span id="p62">[<sup><small>p. 62</small></sup>]</span> first disciples on, but that now, when there is no longer any up or down, or heaven beyond the clouds, men on this whirling planet in the sky should still be preserving in religious imagination what they have discarded everywhere else.

Similarly, our conceptions of God have been shaped by picture-thinking set in the framework of the old world-view. God as a king on high — our fathers, living under monarchy, rejoiced in that image and found it meaningful. His throne, his crown, his scepter, his seraphic retinue, his law's, rewards, and punishments — how dominant that picture was and how persistent is the continuance of it in our hymns and prayers! It was always partly poetry, but it had a prose background: there really had been at first a celestial land above the clouds where God reigned and where his throne was in the heavens.

Even to-day preachers “fall before the throne” when they pray, and ask their congregations to sing, “O worship the King all glorious above.” It is noticeable, however, that when they try to be personally helpful and explain to their people the meaning of communion <span id="p63">[<sup><small>p. 63</small></sup>]</span> with God, they are likely to leave the imagery of monarchy utterly behind and take up radio. The living voice out of the unseen, the mystery of fellowship with the invisible, the necessity of being rightly tuned, the interferences that break receptivity — ^men have ^ined a new and congenial picture in which to image their dealings with God. I suspect that the invention of radio has increased the quantity of praying in America.

This obvious fact that religion habitually pictures God in terms of some dominant element in the generation’s life, making and worshiping imaginary idols even when visible idols are denied, is, of course, meat and drink to the atheists. Religion, they say, is fancy, poetry, mirage, pictare-thinking pathetically mistaken for substantial truth. This scorn of theirs, however, ought to be short-lived. It cannot easily survive tu quoque. The man who subscribes to the current mechanistic materialism is in the same boat with the theist, as far as picture-thinking is concerned.

<span id="p64">[<sup><small>p. 64</small></sup>]</span>

The very latest style m materialistic philosophy is to believe that everything is a physicochemical mechanism — that the whole universe and every living organism in it from a protozoon to a Plato can be adequately described in mechanistic terms. A few weeks ago a letter came from one of America’s leading lawyers, announcing that he felt sure that man was merely a mechanism. That is our latest, up-tothe-minute philosophy, but obviously it is picture-thinking.

The machine is the dominant builder of our civilization. It is the newest and most tremendous power with which our society deals. Anybody acquainted with the history of human thought could have predicted that, just as absolute monarchy, feudalism, humanitarianism, democracy, and all other dominant factors which have captured the imagination of successive generations have had their counterparts in contemporary philosophy, so a machine age would produce a mechanistic theory of life. It has done so. Never was there a clearer illustration of the inevitable urge whidi causes a generation to picture the cosmos in <span id="p65">[<sup><small>p. 65</small></sup>]</span> terms of a dominant factor in common experience.

Nevertheless, this particular bit of picturethinking' is obviously inadequate to describe even a crab, much less a cosmos. Nobody doubts that there is a profoundly important mechanistic aspect to a crab but, after all, a crab is hardly a machine: he grows from the conceptual egg to maturity, and a machine does not; from inward energies he can reproduce amputated members, and a machine cannot; he can spontaneously adjust himself from within to new situations, and a machine cannot; he propagates his kind through the mystery of generation, and a machine does not. None of the most characteristic functions of a living organism does a machine perform, so that what it means to call even a crab a mechanism is not clear — ^much less what it means so to describe a man. Can a mechanism remember, think, distinguish between right and wrong, fight for ideals, fall in love, and worsdiip God? All this, however, will not stop our prominent lawyer from calling man a mechanism. There is to-day an almost irresistible craving to crowd all life back into the familiar, pp66 easily visualized picture of a mechanical process. And that will go on for a long while, despite the truth of Professor Thomson’s protest from the viewpoint of biology, that “mechanical formulas do not begin to answer the distinctively biological questions.”

This recognition of our inveterate imaginativeness, whether we are religious or not, should be chastening. It ought to set us, somewhat humbled, to considering how we do picture the God whom we either believe in or deny.

Of course, the plain truth is that any picture of God which our minds can amceive must be utterly inadequate. We cannot catch the sun at noon in our butterfly nets. This admitted partialness, not to say falseness of all our attempted thoughts about God should disturb no one. “Now we see in a mirror, darkly” is still true. The interesting fact is that, not only can we not imagine God, but science has brought us to the place where we cannot imagine the physical universe. As Einstein, for example, <span id="p67">[<sup><small>p. 67</small></sup>]</span> knows it, it is unpicturable. A four-dimensional, curved cosmos, with time and space commingled so that no one can tell at what point w'henness leaves off, and whereness begins — ^that may be set down in mathematical formulae but it cannot be pictured. Even a helium atom, going eighteen thousand miles a second through a glass wall without leaving a trace of its transit, may be thought but it cannot be imagined.

A friend of mine, an engineer, while not supposing himself to be one of the half dozen or so folk on earth who understand Einstein, thinks that he does see what Einstein is driving at, and is ambitious to make me see it too. His ingenuity at illustration is amazing. He resorts to extraordinary devices of inaagery to help me visualize this physical universe as it really is. I supposed* that all this was a friendly concession to my stupidity, but in a recent scientific book I find the same resort to illustration in the endeavor to make relativity dear. The learned writer pictures a man on a moving Aip, poised for a stroke at a ^une of shul9eboard, his seeming rest instantaneous only and relative to the ship’s motion, and that, <span id="p68">[<sup><small>p. 68</small></sup>]</span> relative to the movements of winds and currents, and those to the rotation of the earth on its axis and its revolution in its orbit, and these to the whole solar system’s speed through space. How like preachers in their methods these scientists have become! How they hanker after illustrations, seek for them high and low, are blissful when they find one ! They are facing at last the same problem which we face — ^they are trying to picture the unpicturablel

## IV

What, then, shall the religious man do? He cannot take in earnest the man-sized representations of God on which, it may be, he was brought up — & god walking in a garden in the cool of the day, making woman from man’s rib, confounding men’s speech lest they build a tower too high, decreeing a flood to drown humanity, trying to slay a man at a wayside inn because his child was not circumcised, showing his back but not his face to a man upon a mountain-top, or ordering the massacre of his chosen people’s enemies, men, women, and <span id="p69">[<sup><small>p. 69</small></sup>]</span> children, without merey. He iS in revolt against all that as Euripides, over four centuries before Christ, rebelled against the gods of Olympus:

> Say not there be adulterers in. Heaven
> Nor prisoner gods and gaoler. Long ago
> My heart has known it false and will not alter.
> God, if he be God, lacketh naught. All these
> Are dead unhappy tales of minstrelsy.

Nevertheless, the religious man must have imaginations of God, if God is to be real to him. Watch the European peasant at his wayside shrine before the image of the Madonna, or the Moslem, with his theoretical monotheism, worshiping nevertheless at the tomb of his local saint, or the Buddhist, with his impersonal deity, bowing still before the placid image of Amida, or the Protestant, refusing outward images but making verbal ones by tihe hundred, and the impression is irresistible: the vividness and availability of man’s religion depend largely on his imaginations of G€»d.

Moreover, if religion is to be vital — fellowship with God sustaining life, and responsibility to God quickening conscience — these <span id="p70">[<sup><small>p. 70</small></sup>]</span> imaginations must picture our dealing with the Divine in terms of personal relationship. God must have in him, in ways however far beyond our capacity to think, qualities akin to those which in ourselves we meet as intelligence, purposefulness, good-will. This is the gist of the whole matter in the religious problem of thinking about God. We may start, if we will, with this vast unpicturable universe, and try to imagine God adequate to its size and its complexity, its order and beauty, its terror and prodigality. Creative Reality, conceived in spiritual rather than physical terms — ^that undoubtedly is God. But that cold, bare statement will not satisfy the religious man’s imagination or his life. The real question is: can God be thought of in terms of personal rektionship, so that we can commune with him, be inspired by him, depend on him, be responsible to him, and, like our fathers before us, love him so deeply that we will love nothing else too much, and fear him so reverently that we will fear nothing else at all?

Now, all philosophies divide on this one issue: whether the subhuman world of physics and chemistry or the human world, with its <span id="p71">[<sup><small>p. 71</small></sup>]</span> spiritual values and possibilities, shall supply the dominant pictures of what reality is like. Some philosophies split the world in two, the subhuman world on one side, the human on the other, and, treating the latter as a mere echo of the former, they get their controlling ideas from the physical world alone. That is the source of all materialism. It starts by forgetting man in the higher ranges of his life, treating man as though he were not a substantial part of the universe to be explained, thinking of man and his spiritual values as an accidental appendage to creation, and then basing its theories on an analysis of the subhuman rei mainder. It chops the real universe into two I portions and takes all its dominant ideas from the lower half.

But all idealistic philosophies and all high religion refuse that false division and that insane choice, and are sure that, wherever else Creative Reality may have displayed his quality and revealed his meaning, he has done so in the spiritual life of man. Whatever else may be true of man, he certainly is part and parcel of this universe, bone of its bone, flesh of its flesh, the climactic expression of its life, <span id="p72">[<sup><small>p. 72</small></sup>]</span> and the universe cannot be interpreted apart from him. In the Yerkes Observatory I watched, one night, an astronomer studying the nebula of Ljra. In one unillumined spot of it, which through the telescope seemed negligible, thousands of our solar systems could be lost. Yet which was more marvelous, the nebula of Lyra or the astronomer? The nebula is only gaseous matter, but the man who was apprehending it, measuring it, computing its distance, analyzing its substance, and stating its laws, the man who with his thought was conquering Lyra, besetting it behind and before and laying his hand upon it, was far more marvelous than the thing that was merely being apprehended. Any philosophy which, in trying to explain creation, takes in the constellations but leaves out ihe mind which grasps them cannot be true.

In man at his best, then. Reality receives its clearest revelation — that is the faith of aU high religion. The place where man vitaBy finds God, deals with God, discovers the qualities of God, and learns to think religiously about God is not primarily among the stars but within his own experience of goodness, <span id="p73">[<sup><small>p. 73</small></sup>]</span> truth, and beauty, and the truest images of God are therefore to be found in man’s spiritual life. Partial they are, inadequate, not “without omission, disproportion, or aberration,” as Martineau phrased it; but still the old figures — fatherhood, friendship, love, justice — by which the seers and saints have tried to make the Eternal real to their imaginations, are the true clue to the understanding of him. That was Plato’s meaning when he said, “God is never in any way unrighteous; he is perfect righteousness. And there is nothing more like him than one of us who is himself most righteous.” That was Jesus’ meaning when he said, “When ye pray, say. Father.” That has been the experience of coimtless folk who for themselves have discovered Tolstoy’s truth: “Where love is, God is.” And that has been the historic church’s meaning when it has exalted the incarnation as the center of its doctrine — ^“the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”

Indeed, I would go farther. Protestantism has b<«n too bare of symbolism, too afraid of warmth and color, too reluctant to serve the spiritual life by the beautiful uses of the imagination. <span id="p74">[<sup><small>p. 74</small></sup>]</span> The shrines and images, the crucifixes and pictures before which some other Christians worship have seemed to Protestants idolatrous. But to many a supposed idolater they mean something else altogether — ^aids to the imagination, as a trinket or a photograph, perhaps a very poor one, may help to recreate the image of a friend and vivify the consciousness of his felt presence. By tradition and temperament I am a thoroughgoing Protestant, but I wish that in our services we knew better how to quicken the imagination of our people and make the divine Presence mystically real. Perhaps, some day, like the scientist using his shufileboard game to illustrate the universe, we shall employ more generously the aid of symbolism, knowing alike how true it all is and yet how far from true of him whose judgments are unsearchable and whose ways past tracing out.
