## I

NO ONE who has any capacity to call out responses from undergraduates can go to a college campus to-day and present tne cause of religion without getting some vigorous protests against faith. I do not mean protests simply against faith in this particular doctrine or that, but against faith in general. A typical college youth spmns faith. He asserts his unwillingness to believe anything. He prides himself on accepting only the demonstrably true.

One of the chief criticisms, however, to be passed on many such young skeptics is that they are not thoroughgoing in their skepticism. They toy with it, play about it, go as far in it as their whims lead them, but, as for complete renunciation of faith and exclusive reliance on demonstrable propositions, they do not remotely approach their ideal. Nor is the reason difficult to see. Complete skepticism is harder to reach than the North Pole and, once <span id="p46"><sup><small>[ p. 46 ]</small></sup></span> there, one would find living even more impossible.

Faith as religion uses it is generally the first object of attack when the youth begins to achieve the skeptical attitude. Nor can religion complain at this for she has been notoriously guilty of making faith synonymous vdth credulity. When Alice faced the Queen’s assertion that she was one hundred one years, five months, and one day old, she cried, “I can’t believe _that!_” “Can’t you?” said the Queen. “Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes,” That is no caricature of a large amount of so-called faith as the church has enjoined it and religious people practised it. Many folk to-day still draw a long breath, shut their eyes, and believe the Bible “from cover to cover,” or commit their minds, in fee simple to possess and own, to some creed or church. They call this faith, but it is to faith what soothsaying astrology on a side street is to astronomy — ^its perversion and degradation. Beal faith, as Buskin said, is veracity of insight.

Intelligent religion uses faith as science does. In any physical realm investigation starts with a mass of apparently unconnected facts be <span id="p47"><sup><small>[ p. 47 ]</small></sup></span> tween which nobody knows the rational relationships. Like the contents of a school-boy’s pocket, they are a miscellany of unassociated elements. Then into the presence of this salmagundi comes a great mind. He has more than sight; he has insight. He looks through the facts and beyond them into their relationships. He seizes with his imagination the principle of their unity. He leaps to an hypothesis that may conceivably explain and systematize them. He cannot at first prove it, but he believes it. That hypothesis years afterward may still be incapable of complete demonstration and yet be the working basis on which all scientists proceed. That leap of the mind through the facts and beyond them to grasp their significance, organize them, and so make order out of chaos, is intellectual faith.

Scientific faith grasped the new astronomy before telescopes were strong enough to prove it, unified the cosmos under the law of gravitation while there were inexplicable facts against it, asserted the universal uniformity of law, although even yet a leading biolo^st can call it a “gigantic assumption,” and to-day, in area <span id="p48"><sup><small>[ p. 48 ]</small></sup></span> after area, ventures into unexplored territoryon the basis of veracity of insight.

A new eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews could be written on the heroes of scientific faith. By faith Sir John Mandeville in 1356 said, “I tell you, certainly, that men may go all roimd the world, as well under as above, and return to their country.” By faith Columbus reached land by sailing westward although mankind had been incredulous about it. By faith Newton grasped the idea of gravitation although he was the first to guess it. By faith Darwin seized on an hypothesis which arranged and explained facts else inexplicable, although it took a daring venture of the mind to do it. These also are heroes of faith.

That they dealt honestly and tirelessFy with facts, studied them -with patient industry and at all costs and hazards endeavored to achieve the truth about them is no denial of their exercise of faith. Faith is an indispensable way of dealing with facts. It goes through facts into their meanings; it dares venturesome interpretations of them and so systematizes them and gets order out of them. It is not blindness <span id="p49"><sup><small>[ p. 49 ]</small></sup></span> and credulity; it is vision plus daring. As a recent scientific writer put it, faith is a “spirit of trusting adventure, often with little to justify it, that has been the mainspring of all progress, mental and material.”

## II

One of the best pieces of advice, therefore, that can be given the incipient skeptic — especially if he is confining his skepticism to spiritual realities or is displaying pertness and flippancy, which are the young skeptic’s mumps and measles — is to insist, not that he give up skepticism, but that he go through with it to its logical end and see where it lands him. Chaos is the destination. For faith has been involved in every step that humanity has taken away from a disordered existence, whimsical, without unity, sense, or reason, toward a meaningful universe seen steadily and seen whole.

This achievement of order out of chaos is the central business of man’s intellect. As man’s mind first saw this world, it was a chaotic mess, capricious, imreliable, without or <span id="p50"><sup><small>[ p. 50 ]</small></sup></span> ganizing principles to give it sense or laws to unify its operations. No connections were visible between any one thing and another, and even after history became articulate some still ascribed childbirth to no other cause than supernatural intervention and thought that everjrthing which moved in heaven above or on the earth beneath was a separate being with a will to do as it pleased. Into this topsyturvy, harum-scarum world man came and brought with him an unappeasable impatience with chaos. He could not live in chaos; he must have order. Upon the great adventure to discover here a rational universe he launched his mind, and the story of the hazard and heroism, the failures and triumphs of that crusade makes up the intellectual history of man.

It is not enough to say that in this process man merely discovered the truth about the universe. What man has done is more creative than that. He has in a sense constructed the unity he believes in. He has invented mathematical formulas that resemble nothing in the external world. He has framed scientific laws tentatively summarizing in mental shorthand the observed uniformities of nature. <span id="p51"><sup><small>[ p. 51 ]</small></sup></span> He has made vast astronomical generalizations that are beyond hinnan demonstration. In aU this he believes that he has achieved some real approximation to the truth about the disordered world which he is trying to conquer with his mind. This aspect of man, puny of stature, the helpless prey of untoward circumstance from bacteria to earthquakes, standing up to confront the universe, insisting that, as for him, chaos shall not reign there, that he will see through chaos and make order out of it, is altogether the most amazing sight that creation offers.

Behind the whole intellectual adventure of mankind, therefore, is faith — ^the basic faith that chaos cannot be the last word in any realm. Faith is not an excrescence on the mental life. Faith 'is not a flimsy patch to cover the intellect’s nakedness when the solid garment of knowledge gives out. The fimdamental necessity of faith is no more peculiar to the saints than to the scientists, as Huxley recognized when he said, “As for the strong conviction that the cosmic order is rational, and the faith that, throughout aU durations, unbroken order has reigned in the universe, I not only accept <span id="p52"><sup><small>[ p. 52 ]</small></sup></span> it, but I am disposed to think it the most important of all truths.”

## III

This tremendous assumption of nature’s law-abiding uniformity which underlies all science and is for science, as Huxley said, the most important of all truths, is a perfect example of faith. Its devotees hold it against all comers and in spite of all adverse appearances, because by it alone can chaos be mentally conquered and civilized. If a man projects himself back into the world as it appeared before this gigantic doctrine of law-abiding uniformity occupied men’s minds, looks with naive eyes on that strangely jumbled, lawless salmagundi of a world with innumerable, diverse elements going each its own way, he must be impressed with the daring insight and induction combined which it took to subsume all that wild disarray imder a single concept like uniformity of law. That concept is still incapable of complete demonstration. No one with absolute certainty can tell how far the objective truth of it goes. It is primarily the <span id="p53"><sup><small>[ p. 53 ]</small></sup></span> insistence of the human mind on getting some formula of order in the world. “The principle of uniformity in nature,” said Professor William James, “has to be sought under and in spite of the most rebellious appearances; and our conviction of its truth is far more like religious faith than like assent to a demonstration.”

Being a thoroughgoing skeptic, therefore, is serious business. The whole mental process by which we build a unified, orderly, and reasonable world is saturated with faith. We believe but cannot positively demonstrate that our minds can tell us the truth, that our knowledge corresponds with reality, that the objective world exists, that the universe is rational, that cause and effect obtain throughout all time and space. All these and other like convictions are basic faiths by which we have intellectually civilized the world.

## IV

In the spiritual realm, also, man has an ingrained and despotic impatience of chaos. A world of moral topsy-turvy without unity <span id="p54"><sup><small>[ p. 54 ]</small></sup></span> and sense in it is as intolerable for his mind as his physical environment would be, left unorganized and whimsical. He cannot stand it. Nature does not abhor a vacuum with more insistence than man abhors a jumbled and senseless moral world. To tell him that his spiritual life is a haphazard accident which straggled into transient existence as a by-product of a process physically caused and determined is to make nonsense out of the highest values that man knows.

Of course, the imperious idea that man’s spiritual life on this wandering island in the sky does make sense is a tremendous assumption. Nevertheless, there is no peace for man until he has foimd satisfying meaning in his spiritual as well as his physical life. What many a young collegian, trying to be a skeptic, does not understand is that religion, however blindly it has sometimes worked, has been on its intellectual side an endeavor to supply this need for a unified spiritual world. The development of monotheism parallels in its motives and desires the development of modern science: both display the same passionate wish to organize the world. Out of the early whim <span id="p55"><sup><small>[ p. 55 ]</small></sup></span> sicality of animism where there were as many spirits as there were things; through polytheism with its multitudinous gods from which an oligarchy of great deities gradually emerged; through henotheism where, though there were many gods, a people claimed one god for itself and gave single-hearted devotion to him; to the climactic insight and faith that beneath all diversity, confusion, and contradiction, one purpose binds the whole spiritual process together, one will controls it, one goodness underlies it, man fought his way up to see his spiritual life steadily and whole. Whatever qualifications and enlargements modern thought may work in historic monotheism, a gain was wrought there which humanity cannot give up without incalculable loss. That, too, was the victory of the human spirit wresting unity and order out of chaos.

As one stands back from this whole process by which man’s mind has been trying to make this world intellectually habitable, it appears of one piece. There may be no sense in this universe at all. It may be an illusion, or a sorry jest, or a tragic accident, Our minds <span id="p56"><sup><small>[ p. 56 ]</small></sup></span> may be lying to us, our so-called knowledge may be hallucination, and all the order and significance we think we find may be our own vain imaginings working on a senseless chaos. To think that is real skepticism. To deny that is to turn toward the fimdamental faith that this universe and our lives within it have discoverable sense in them.

By faith, therefore, man builds the world in which he lives. Long since he has begun to conquer and civilize the physical universe with his hypotheses and generalizations. But that is not enough. Jfot until a man sees moral meaning in his experience, beheves in God, and so achieves a spiritual as well as a physical universe, has he got his world intellectually in hand where he can find satisfying sense in it and unifying purpose running through it. To be sure, that is faith. But it is not blind faith. It is not “believing what you know isn’t so.” It is part and parcel of the whole process by which man has achieved real life out of the materials of existence. It is the climax of the race’s age-long endeavor to conquer chaos and achieve rationality and order.

## V

Everywhere through our colleges, in spite of youthful skepticism, one finds this hunger and thirst for a meaningful spiritual world satisfying to the mind and supporting to the life. No practical preachments alone will meet this need. The students would never dream of saying it so, but they want a theology— an intelligible idea of God in which they can honestly believe. The best of them will be as restless until they find that as scientists would be knowing that there ought to be a doctrine of law-abiding uniformity in physics but as yet unable to state it.

Nor will any half-way station, where they try to content themselves with a God not objectively real but subjectively imagined, be suficient. Some are trying to satisfy themselves with that. Their God is a sort of celestial Uncle Sam, a divine Santa Claus, not really existent but made up by the pooling of their own ideals. God, they say, is not objectively there; he is our invention, the projection of our better selves on the vast screen of the universe. That idea reminds me of my boyhood when I <span id="p58"><sup><small>[ p. 58 ]</small></sup></span> used to think that the waving branches of the trees caused the wind. It is a very plausible hypothesis. Whenever the branches wave the wind blows; the wind never does blow except when the branches wave; why not explain the wind by the movement of the trees? Nevertheless, the wind does come first; it springs from sources that trees cannot explain, and all the rustling of their multitudinous leaves is but an answer to it. So I am confident that God comes first, that our spiritual restlessness until we find him is a response to his presence, and I am sure that the faith by which one thus orders and unifies his spiritual world, although it is more difficult of demonstration, is essentially the same kind of faith as that by which the scientist in his realm is conquering chaos.
