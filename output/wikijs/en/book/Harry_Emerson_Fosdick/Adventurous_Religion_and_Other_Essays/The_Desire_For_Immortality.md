## I

ON EASTER morning in a Christian church not what goes on in the chancel but what goes on in the nave is much the more interesting. From the chancel the familiar Easter hymns are announced, the triumphant anthems sung, the confident sermon preached, the Scriptures read in which ancient believers expressed their ardent faith. But in the nave are all sorts of ordinary people who in their secret thought harbor every imaginable kind of idea about the mystery of death and what comes after it. To one who sees both sides of the matter, a startling hiatus divides the resounding certainty of sermon, creed, and anthem from the thoughts which multitudes of individuals secretly entertain about immortality.

In a typical metropolitan congregation on Easter morning how many different sorts of thinking will be going on! Some of the con gregation will be convinced that, after all, a man would better satisfy himself with one life <span id="p185"><sup><small>[ p. 185 ]</small></sup></span> at a time, make the most of that, and not worry about any other. When Henry D. Thoreau was nearing death, his friend, Parker Pillsbury, asked him whether he could see anything on the other side. “One world at a time, Parker,” said Thoreau. That attitude strikes many people as practical common sense.

Others will be there to whom life already has been so difficult and wearisome that they are not anxious for any further adventuring on the other side of the grave. When they are through living they want to be through. That is not often said in public, but one hears it in secret. A. burdensome and disillusioning life might be supposed to issue in desire to try life again under better conditions, but sometimes it issues in utter willingness to finish once for all the whole bewildering business of trying to live anyway. Swinburne caught the mood when he sang:

From too much love of living,
From hope and fear set free,
We thank with brief thanksgiving
Whatever gods may be
That no life lives forever;
That dead men rise up never; <span id="p186"><sup><small>[ p. 186 ]</small></sup></span>
That even the weariest river
Winds somewhere safe to sea.

Still others will come to church on Easter morning to whom all the symbolism with which hopes of the future life have clothed themselves is so disturbing and even revolting that before service is over they will find it difficult not to sit in the seat of the scornful. Heaven, hell, angels, crowns, thrones, choirs, harps, palms, golden streets, pearly gates—all this poetic imagery, once so meaningful to our fathers, is

“to them utterly unreal. It is like the Greek mythology in which even our English poets once supposed they had to phrase their thoughts. What poetry outgrew, however, religion still preserves. We still body forth our hopes in mythological terms and, what is worse, our wooden-headed Western literalism has often used this symbolism as though it were fact. Not long ago in New York State, an evangelist went up and down among us saying this: “_Hell has been running for six thousand years._ It is filling up every day. Where is it? About eighteen miles from here. . . . _Which way is it? Straight down_—not over eighteen miles, not less than five miles, down in the <span id="p187"><sup><small>[ p. 187 ]</small></sup></span> bowels of the earth.” Even when the picturesque symbolism of heaven and hell has been used more intelligently than that, to how much glib and superficial certainty have we had to listen from those who, as we knew well, had no more bona-fide information than we had about the things which with such exactitude they were describing. The folly of literalism and dogmatism in this realm is colossal, and on Easter morning some will be so scornful of picture-thinking, projected into the future world, that they will miss the main issue altogether.

Others will be there whose difficulties with immortality lie in another realm. They dislike the selfish motives associated with the world to come. Be good that you may win heavenly recompense; avoid evil that you may escape future perdition—such they think is the church’s message and the church’s central interest in immortality, and not from low motives but from high they revolt against such calculating incentives to right living. Seneca, the Stoic teacher, in one of his parables, pictured a mariner struggling with a storm-tossed boat upon an angry sea and crying, “O Nep <span id="p188"><sup><small>[ p. 188 ]</small></sup></span> tune, thou canst save me if thou wilt, or thou canst drown me. But whether or no, I will hold my rudder true!’ That seems to many a nobler way to live than working for a heavenly crown. Whatever happens after death, they say, we will steer a straight course now, and you may keep your dreams of a rewarding paradise, if goodness for its own sake seems inadequate.

Still others will be in church on Easter Sunday—those to whom this present life with its opportunities and tasks, its multitude of things to know and do, is so engaging that immortality seems a pallid, far-fetched issue about which they need not much concern themselves. They used to hear that if they should give up faith in immortality they probably would plunge into self-indulgent living, but they no longer think that true. The tasks which invite human effort—knowledge to be gained, inventions to be made, beauties to be enjoyed, evils to be overcome, social reforms to be achieved— seem to them engrossing opportunities, ample to absorb the energies and centralize the purposes of men. Let us give ourselves to human service, they say, not thinking of immortality <span id="p189"><sup><small>[ p. 189 ]</small></sup></span> of personal life but of immortality of influence, a heritage of good work done to be handed down to our children after us. Many highminded people feel that. Says a professor in one of our greatest women’s colleges, “The modern belief in immortality costs more than itis worth . . . its disappearance from among the most civilized nations would be, on the whole, a gain.”

Another class of people is sure to be in church on Easter morning—those who would dearly like to believe in immortality but cannot. They have given hostages to fortune in friends and family who have passed through death into the unknown. They would be happier far if the resounding assurance that death is swallowed up in victory awoke an answering conviction in their minds. But how can they believe that? These swarming millions of humanity on this negligible planet in the sky, each one compounded of physical elements, with his spiritual aspect as much a transient product as is the fragrance of a flower and as such to perish when the unsubstantial fabric shall dissolve—that picture comes between their minds and the triumphant words of creed <span id="p190"><sup><small>[ p. 190 ]</small></sup></span> and anthem. They feel as one man once wrote me after hearing a sermon on immortality, “How much I wish that I could share your hopes!”

In varying numbers representatives of all these groups are likely to be in our churches on Easter morning, drawn there by family ties, by traditional habit, by a general desire to support the church, by an innate religiousness that while refusing the form desires the substance, or perhaps by a wistful curiosity as to what the preacher will say about the matter this year. And all around these minority groups—with here and there a spiritualist sure of communion with the unseen world—will be the majority: devout believers untroubled by any doubts of life eternal, the bereaved to whom passionate desire for reunion with their dead submerges all other considerations of mind and heart.

Such is the picture which presents itself to one who for a time forgets the chancel and remembers the nave. Nor can a thoughtful man regard that picture with the sympathy that it <span id="p191"><sup><small>[ p. 191 ]</small></sup></span> deserves without wondering what he himself thinks in his secret soul about immortality. Especially, what difference does it make? What is at stake in immortality? That solace, comfort, hopes of happy reunions after death are at stake is obvious. But is that all? Is faith in immortality only another “defense mechanism” by which in hours of bereavement we make life more endurable? What fundamental difference does it make whether man retains his confidence that death does not end all?

Certainly it does make a difference in our thought of ourselves. The deepest, obscurest, most difficult mystery in the universe is not far off among the stars but within ourselves. The relationship between those nine billion brain cells with which we do all our thinking, on the one side, and on the other our personalities, our thoughts, ideals, purposes, loves, and expanding possibilities of character is the most baffling problem in the universe.

At first sight it might seem simple and plausible to hold that the brain cells, as it were, secrete our thought, by subtle organization create what we call ourselves; but how can that be? <span id="p192"><sup><small>[ p. 192 ]</small></sup></span> Everything physical moves in paths of least resistance. Was it brain cells, obeying that law, which by some fortuitous concatenation produced our higher mathematics or the Ode to a Skylark or Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony? Did the cells of the Broca convolution move in paths of least resistance one happy day to such good effect that they produced the Sermon on the Mount?

This merely physical explanation of ourselves becomes the more difficult the farther one goes into it. For suppose some fluoroscope so ingenious that one, looking through it, could observe the brain cells of a man at work. Then suppose that some mirror could make the instrument introspective so that a man could watch his own brain cells at work. It would be a curious experience. _For who would be doing the watching?_ It does not seem credible that the brain cells could be cleverly looking at themselves.

Some chemists with a flair for statistics have been analyzing the average man—five feet ten inches tall and weighing one hundred and fifty pounds—and have put into picturesque terms what he is made of: enough fat to make seven <span id="p193"><sup><small>[ p. 193 ]</small></sup></span> bars of scap, enough iron to make a nail of medium size, enough sugar to fill a shaker, enough lime to whitewash a chicken-coop, enough phosphorus to make twenty-two hundred match tips, enough magnesium for a dose of magnesia, enough potassium to explode a toy cannon, together with a little sulphur. And they say that these chemical elements at current market rates are worth about ninety-eight cents. It is an amazing mystery—our saints, prophets, and martyrs, our Shelleys, Raphaels, Livingstones, and Lincolns, all compounded of ninety-eight cents’ worth of chemical material!

The question of immortality, therefore, involves much more than a postponed hope about what is going to happen after death. It vitally concerns what we are now. Do we honestly think that it is an adequate statement of the truth to say that chemical elements, worth some sixty-six cents a hundred-weight, cleverly organized by Nature unaware of what she did, issued in our Isaiahs and Platos, our Galileos and Darwins,—forgive the irreverence,—in Jesus Christ himself? Or do we think something else—that within and reliant on this flesh, as within a scaffolding, personality may be <span id="p194"><sup><small>[ p. 194 ]</small></sup></span> built as a temple, the abiding spirit within the transitory frame, so that when at last the scaffolding is taken down the permanent consequence shall remain?

However one may answer that, one cannot say that it makes no difference. It makes a tremendous difference. It would make a difference if no question of comfort in the presence of death were involved at all. Many people seem to think that immortality is a future matter. Upon the contrary, it is an imperious assertion about what we are now. We may be merely delicately compounded matter, or it may be true that “now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be.” Only exceedingly superficial thought could suppose that that does not make a very great difference indeed.

A university student once came to see me with a desperate moral problem on his hands. He had started out feeling free to do as he pleased and he now faced the inevitable nemesis—he was not free to stop. Out of a clear sky came his unexpected ejaculation, “‘if I could believe in immortality I think that I could see it through.” He did not mean that <span id="p195"><sup><small>[ p. 195 ]</small></sup></span> he wanted the fires of hell to scare him or a heavenly crown to reward him. He meant that if, sitting there, he was simply a chance collocation of chemical elements, it did not seem to him worth while to face the desperate, sacrificial struggle that moral victory would cost. But if he were an abiding spiritual personality— well, what Phidias would not carve more sacrificially at marble than at sandstone?

A man’s thought of himself must always make a difference to his life, and immortality is the supreme assertion of abiding spiritual value in man.

## III

Belief in immortality makes a difference also in one’s thought of the creative process as a whole. Is creation purposeful, working for large ends which when achieved will justify the agony that the process now is costing? A good deal of our modern philosophy dodges that question, goes off on small side paths when that major interrogation comes stalking down the main avenue, even scoffs at those who waste time thinking about it. But by that attitude <span id="p196"><sup><small>[ p. 196 ]</small></sup></span> modern philosophy only reveals its own mental weariness, too tired of large issues to deal with them longer, and retreating to nearer and more spindling questions, as though the central inquiries concerning human destiny could really be forgotten. They will not be forgotten. Lowell, in The Cathedral, summed up an unescapable experience of man when he spoke of life’s apparent futility:

Fruitless, except we now and then divined
A mystery of Purpose, gleaming through
The secular confusions of the world.

To be sure, this universe, so far from looking like a Father’s house, as Christianity pictures it, seems rather like a gigantic mechanism ruthlessly crashing on. Well, there are mechanisms that men make which ruthlessly crash on. A railroad system is a mechanism, and to see a great locomotive drag a train out of the Grand Central Station on its steel rails is to see one of the most ruthlessly mechanical procedures which can be imagined, but, for all that, there is purpose in it. That train is going somewhere. Get on it and it will take you to Chicago. So I do not mind this universe resembling, <span id="p197"><sup><small>[ p. 197 ]</small></sup></span> in many of its aspects, a colossal mechanism if it is going somewhere, if only there is a purpose which, achieved, will justify the agony that it has cost.

This idea of purpose in the universe has been, I think, not weakened but helped by the discovery of evolution. How long man has been on this earth we do not know, but he has been here for a long time and he came from lowly origins. We know something about him since the days of the cavemen. We see him winning his fight against the great beasts, the great forests, the great cold. We see him creating tools, framing the miracle of language, learning Nature’s laws and mastering her forces, founding governments, and rising to high thoughts of God and immortality. At the climax of this amazing development of human life upon the planet some strange and promising things have eventuated: character at times of such quality and impressiveness that one cannot foresee limits to man’s enlarging spiritual life; relationships like parenthood, true love, and friendship, around whose expanding possibilities one cannot put a boundary; creative power to make things useful and beautiful,—great inventions, <span id="p198"><sup><small>[ p. 198 ]</small></sup></span> great books, great music, noble art—until no horizons can be seen about man’s possible creativeness; social hopes, at last, of a kingdom of righteousness upon the earth. It does look as though there were an adventure going on upon this planet with something like purpose at the heart of it.

One thing, however, man never has been able to escape—death. That has always been the problem which man faced when he thought of his possibilities. Many people seem to suppose that this problem of death is merely a matter of individual concern and that immortality is only a matter of individual consolation. That is nonsense. Any sensible man would dispense with his personal continuance if on the whole that seemed best. Death is not merely an individual problem; it is a racial problem. Without immortality all our fathers are finally dead, and we shall be finally dead, and our children will be finally dead, until at last, upon a planet that was once uninhabitable and will be uninhabitable again, every human being will be dead—nothing left to conserve the spiritual gains of all this sacrifice upon the earth. I cannot believe that. I cannot believe that this <span id="p199"><sup><small>[ p. 199 ]</small></sup></span> ascending struggle of humankind is doomed to end in a hopeless cinder heap. And I am sure that it makes a difference what one thinks about this as he tackles the problems of life.

## IV

On Easter Sunday morning, therefore, some of us will be in church who do not belong to any of the groups we named at first. We have come through doubt to confidence that this mortal must put on immortality. We cannot credibly explain personality as a transient, accidental effluence of flesh, nor think that this universe at last will be as though mankind had never lived in it at all, We cannot submit to the mental confusion, the triumphant irrationality of existence where death finally is victor over all.

If some one says that we cannot demonstrate immortality, we grant that to start with. “We do not believe immortality,” said Martineau, “because we have proved it, but we forever try to prove it because we believe it.” That attitude is familiar in science as it is in religion. Some things in science we believe because we <span id="p200"><sup><small>[ p. 200 ]</small></sup></span> can positively demonstrate them. But toward some others, not capable of complete demonstration, like the universal sway of the conservation of energy or the uniformity of law, we keep pushing out our proof as far as we can reach, because we cannot make sense of the world without believing them. So in religion there are two kinds of truth. The power of prayer to stabilize and strengthen the inward life of man—that can be demonstrated. But immortality is not like that. Unless you accept spiritualism you cannot prove immortality. But from man’s first groping endeavors to find meaning in life he has tirelessly tried to prove it because he could not help believing it. Without it human life is ultimately shadowed and undone with a sense of unutterable irrationality and futility. As John Fiske said, “I believe in the immortality of the soul, not in the sense in which I accept the demonstrable truths of science, but as a supreme act of faith in the reasonableness of God’s work.”
