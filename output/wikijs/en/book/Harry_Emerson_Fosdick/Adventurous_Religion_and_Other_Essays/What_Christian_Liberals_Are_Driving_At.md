## I

Tue subject is difficult to write about because religious liberalism is so often vague and nebulous. Misty in outline, constantly im process of alteration, liberalism bewilders many to-day who would like to understand it. The public barometers indicate that a change in the religious weather is coming on; the newspapers are full of theological controversies; such names as fundamentalist, liberal, modernist, are freely applied; but just what it is all about is often difficult for a plain man to find out.

Certainly, I cannot claim the right to speak for all Christian liberals. There are too many different sorts of them, from swashbuckling radicals, believing not much of anything, to men of well-stabilized convictions who are tolerant of differences and open-minded to new truth. But there is a large and growing group in our churches for whom I shall try to speak.

<span id="p233"><sup><small>[ p. 233 ]</small></sup></span>

Let me propose at the start three tests by which the kind of liberal whom I shall endeavor to represent can be recognized. First, he has come into his new attitudes and ways of thinking, not simply as a matter of intellectual adventure, but through the deepening of his spiritual life. He is a liberal because he is more religious, not because he is less. His growing soul, cramped in old restraints, has struck out for air to breathe.

Some of us began our religious life under the domination of ideas about the Bible, God, Christ, heaven, and hell, that were current half a century ago. Then our minds grew up to be citizens of the twentieth century. Our experience with prayer, forgiveness, faith, and spiritual renewal deepened and enlarged. We had to dispense with a smaller mental formulation and get a larger one to save our souls. They would have smothered if they could not have broken through into freer air.

It was vitality of religious life that made Paul a liberal, freeing him from the old restraints of Jewish theology and legalism. It was vitality of religious life that made Luther a liberal, striking out for liberty that his soul <span id="p234"><sup><small>[ p. 234 ]</small></sup></span> might live. Such is the genesis of the best liberalism of to-day; it springs not from the diminution of Christian life, but from the expansion of it.

Some liberalism is not of this sort. It is negative, agnostic, destructive. It springs from superficial curiosity that goes novelty seeking for its own sake. It exhibits itself in people like one who recently came to see me: she had started by being a Methodist, had then become a Christian Scientist, had gone from there to Theosophy, had afterward become a Spiritualist, and at last accounts had no idea what she was. It spends its time, like the Athenians, “in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing,” and it is notable that “tell” comes first and “hear” second. Such liberalism leads to shallowness, not depth, to endless questions with no answers to them, to the building of altars “To an Unknown God.”

There was once an insane woman in an asylum who could be kept quiet only by hearing something tear. They used to give her pieces of old silk and she would sit by the hour contentedly <span id="p235"><sup><small>[ p. 235 ]</small></sup></span> pulling them to pieces and listening to them rip. Some liberals are like that.

But very few whom I know are of that totem. Most of them have surrendered smaller ideas and gotten larger ones to give their souls room. ‘The new wine would not stay in the old wine-skins. Like Beethoven, discontented with prevalent musical forms and seeking new ones because he had more music in him than the old forms were adequate to convey, so they have been pushed out into their liberalism by the expansive power of their developing religious life. At any rate, I am sure that no other kind of progressiveness in religion has an abiding contribution to make to Christianity.

A second test of this liberal whom I am trying to represent is emphasis on positive convictions rather than on negative denials. Some liberals make negations their chief stock in trade. Whenever they have a chance they produce a long list of, things which they no longer can believe.

_ How many things, for example, they disbelieve about prayer. ‘They roll under their tongues a story from Pittsburgh: a fire broke out; a woman saw it sweeping up the block in <span id="p236"><sup><small>[ p. 236 ]</small></sup></span> her direction; she prayed; the wind changed; the fire burned down the other way and destroyed some other people’s houses instead of hers. They do not believe that prayer has any such effect. In this world of impartial law, they do not think that God so plays favorites and, like a celestial charity organization society, doles out small gifts upon request to improvident applicants. Neither do I.

But when I observe an attitude toward prayer which mainly concerns itself with ideas discredited and disbelieved, I am impatient. What do we believe about prayer? “He who rises from his knees a better man, his prayer is answered.” Do we know what that means? In the too great rush of our turbulent life, do we know the secret of praying which enables us to get a new grip on ourselves, to see a new perspective around our work, to let the healing influence of the Spirit restore our souls?) Are we experiencing those victories of faith over ourselves and our circumstances which always are the accompaniment of a vital and praying religion? What we do not believe about prayer probably gets us nowhere; what we do positively believe may get us a long way.

<span id="p237"><sup><small>[ p. 237 ]</small></sup></span>

In every aspect of religion this principle holds true. We cannot live upon negations and denials. Life is too complex, too hazardous, too full of mystery; sorrows go too deep; temptations assail too furiously; and the future is too uncertain. We live only on the basis of our convictions, and from religious teachers in particular we need above all else to hear what positively they do believe.

When, therefore, I think of an effective and useful liberal I think of a man like George MacDonald. Some of us know him by his poems, others by his sermons, more by his novels, such as Robert Falconer. He was a Congregational minister in a small parish in England in the middle of the nineteenth century, presenting Christianity in modern terms. One day his deacons came to him to report that it was impossible for them to continue his salary, and that in consequence he would have to go. He innocently offered to remain and support himself by writing and teaching. His wife, however, soon had a woman’s intuition. “George,” she said, “it isn’t that the people here are too poor to pay us. They don’t want

<span id="p238"><sup><small>[ p. 238 ]</small></sup></span>

So George MacDonald was crowded out of his first and only pastorate, went to Manchester and then to London, preached in a hall, and became a great inspiration to multitudes of Christians. William Burnet Wright tells of one Sunday service which he attended. _ MacDonald read the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews on the heroes of faith and began his sermon with a broad Scotch accent: ‘We have heard of these men of feyth. I am not going to tell you what feyth is—there are plenty of clergymen to do that. I am going to try to help you to believe.” ‘Then for an hour and a quarter he poured out his soul on that spellbound congregation until none could have left the hall without being sure that there are great aims to live for, great convictions to live by, great faiths undergirding life, and great hopes ahead.

That is the liberalism that counts.

One more test of the effective Christian liberal remains: he is sacrificially in earnest about establishing God’s will in the earth. Some liberalism does not move in that realm at all. It is an intellectual excursion without moral consecration. It is a set of up-to-date opinions <span id="p239"><sup><small>[ p. 239 ]</small></sup></span> in theology which can be held and defended as a smart pose. There are dilettanti in religion, as elsewhere, who are very modern but not very much in earnest. The necessary business of reforming Christianity, however, to which liberalism has set itself, is too serious for any dilettante attitude to effect. Christianity certainly does need to be reformed. Some, indeed, still think of it as a finished system, its doctrines all defined, its rubrics all elaborated, its duties all laid down—a completed system needing nothing but to be accepted. I do not see how they do it. The Gospel came, an ideal message, into an unideal world and, as in Shakspere’s figure, like the dyer’s hand it has been subdued to the stuff it worked in.

Of course Christianity needs to be reformed. Nearly one-third the population of the globe is nominally Christian. What if they were really Christian? Some forty-six million people in the United States are nominally Christian. What if their Christianity were vital, intelligent, effective? There is no cause on earth for which one who cares about the future of mankind could better pray and work than for the reformation of Christianity, and it is this <span id="p240"><sup><small>[ p. 240 ]</small></sup></span> that the liberals are driving at. But it can be achieved by no mere holding of up-to-date opinions. It is going to take spiritual insight, sacrificial patience, constructive statesmanship to recover the essential principles of Jesus, make them dominant in the church and in the world. The progressive in religion may well test himself at this point. Every day in every way he may be getting liberaler and liberaler; but that will not matter much if, with his new opinions, he is not being made into a more devoted, efficient, constructive builder of a Christian civilization.

These, I think, are the three tests of effective Christian liberalism: it springs from the expansion and deepening of the spiritual life; it dwells in the great centers of affirmation, not of denial; and it issues in constructive statesmanship for the Kingdom.

## II

The representatives of such liberalism are multiplying in the churches. The uproar of the last few years associated with fundamentalism has been caused in part by the clear and <span id="p241"><sup><small>[ p. 241 ]</small></sup></span> true perception of the reactionaries that the liberals are gaining and that, if not stopped now, they will soon be in control. What the liberals are driving at, therefore, is an important matter, not only to the churches, but also to the public in general. Let me try to group their major aims and motives under two heads. For one thing, liberals undoubtedly wish to modernize Christianity’s expression of its faith. The Protestant Reformation was a valiant stroke for liberty, but it occurred before the most characteristic ideas of our modern age had arrived. The Augsburg Confession is a memorable document, but the Lutherans who framed it did not even know that they were living on a moving planet, and Martin Luther himself called Copernicus a new astrologer. The Westminster Confession is a notable achievement in the development of Christian thought, but it was written forty years before Newton published his work on the law of gravitation. Protestantism, that is, was formulated in prescientific days. Not one of its historic statements of faith takes into account any of the masterful ideas which constitute the framework of modern thinking—the inductive <span id="p242"><sup><small>[ p. 242 ]</small></sup></span> method, the new astronomy, natural law, evolution. All these have come since Protestantism arrived. Protestantism stiffened into its classic forms under intellectual influences long antedating our modern world, and the chaos and turmoil in Christian thought to-day are the consequences. They spring directly from the impossible endeavor of large sections of the church to continue the presentation of the Gospel in forms of thought that are no longer real and cogent to well-instructed minds.

If this problem were merely an intellectual matter the liberals would not be so much in earnest about it. What makes it pressing and unescapable is its vital import; it is a matter of life and death to the faith of increasing multitudes of people.

Perilous heresy to welcome modern ways of thinking in religion? The shoe is on the other foot. Our children are going to schools and colleges where scientific methods of thinking are taken for granted, where they underlie all studies and are involved in all results; and the most ruinous blow that can be struck against the faith of our youth is to make them choose between scientific thinking and the Gospel.

<span id="p243"><sup><small>[ p. 243 ]</small></sup></span>

The colleges are often blamed for upsetting the religious security of our young men and women. Any one who knows the colleges will not be tempted to relieve them altogether from the burden of that charge. But as one deals with young men and women religiously upset, one must often blame their unsettlement not so much upon the colleges as upon Christian churches and Sunday schools—upon religious agencies which taught these young people in the beginning that the Christian Gospel is indissolubly associated with the prescientific view of the world in the Scriptures or the creeds; that the Gospel of the Lord Jesus is dependent upon fiat creation or the historic credibility of old miracle narratives; that the God of the Gospel, like the God of the early Hebrew documents, is a magnified man who could walk in the garden in the cool of the day or come down from the sky to confound men’s speech lest they should build a tower high enough to reach his home.

It is a tragic error thus to set up in the minds of young children an artificial adhesion between the Gospel and a literal interpretation of Scripture and creed, so that, when education <span id="p244"><sup><small>[ p. 244 ]</small></sup></span> inevitably opens a child’s mind, the whole unnatural combination of literalism and spiritual faith collapses, and Christ is banished from a soul because he has been associated with opinions that are bound in the end to prove untenable. No more sacred obligation rests upon ministers, teachers, fathers and mothers in this generation than to give children from the first a type of Christianity that will not have to be unlearned. In this regard we are willing in the end that liberalism shall be tested by its fruits.

To be sure, the process of rethinking the mental setting of our faith in terms that will take into account our new science, our new methods of historical study, our new acquaintance with other religions, does have disturbing aspects. 'The mind always walks as uneasily in new ideas as the feet in new shoes. The Protestant Reformation was disturbing. Questions then were raised about the church and pushed to radical conclusions. But this awakened spirit of free inquiry could not stop with the church; it inevitably went on to the Bible. Nothing which can be thought about is too sacred to be investigated by thought. Upon <span id="p245"><sup><small>[ p. 245 ]</small></sup></span> the Bible, therefore, every discoverable light from history, new documents, archeology, textual criticism, comparative religion, is being fearlessly thrown.

This does mean a reinterpretation of Scripture that is disturbing to many people. It does mean readjustment in the church’s approach to the Bible and use of it. But the liberal is persuaded of two things: first, that “The man who refuses to face facts doesn’t believe in God,”’ as Marcus Dods, the stalwart Scotch Presbyterian said; and second, that the Bible, seen in the new light, is in the end a more vital, useful and inspiring book than it was under the old régime. For while thought-forms do vthange, whether in the first century, the sixteenth, or the twentieth, the abiding experiences of the soul do not change, and the Bible supremely springs from and ministers to that permanent realm of spiritual life.

Many popular pictures of liberalism, therefore, are sheer caricatures. Liberalism is not primarily a set of opinions; it is a spirit of free inquiry which wishes to face the new facts, accept whatever is true, and state the abiding principles of Christian faith in cogent and contemporary <span id="p246"><sup><small>[ p. 246 ]</small></sup></span> terms. Liberals differ about innumerable details. Some believe in the virgin birth and some do not; some would state the atonement one way and some another. But their agreement is deep and essential; they believe in the central affirmations of Christianity, the living God, the divine Christ, the indwelling Spirit, forgiveness, spiritual renewal, the coming victory of righteousness on earth, the life everlasting. Such abiding convictions of Christian faith they count so precious that they are desperately concerned lest the modern age should lose them, and they are sure that the modern age will lose them unless we are able to state them in terms of thought which modern minds can use.

Liberalism is not a negative movement; it is a positive campaign to maintain vital religion in the face of materialistic and paganizing influences of our time. Instead, however, of barricading ourselves in the citadel of prescientific theology, we are convinced that the only way to victory is to take the field. If we are to persuade this younger generation, we must meet materialistic philosophy on its own ground, fight it with its own intellectual weapons, <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> beat it at its own game. We must make Christianity intelligible to people of the twentieth century, as our Protestant forefathers made their Christianity intelligible to people of the sixteenth century. Were Luther, Calvin, John Knox here now, that is precisely what they would be doing. It seems to us alike absurd and perilous to insist that religion alone, among vital human interests, cannot rephrase itself in new ways of thought.

## III

The second liberal aim is to put first things first in religion, to subordinate the details of ritual, creed, and church to the major objects of Christianity—the creation of personal character and social righteousness. At the very center of liberalism, as I understand it, is the conviction that nothing fundamentally matters in religion except those things which create private and public goodness. 'The reason why most of our theological controversies are idle beating of the air is that whichever side wins makes no difference to character. In historic and contemporary Christianity three elements <span id="p248"><sup><small>[ p. 248 ]</small></sup></span> have been continually used as competitors of character in the interest of Christians. 'They have repeatedly usurped the place which private and public righteousness ought to occupy as the one supreme matter with which Christianity is concerned and for which it works. ‘These three elements are ritual, doctrine, and church.

This does not mean that ritual is unnecessary or unimportant in religion. We have ritual in courtesy when the hand is extended or the hat lifted ; in love when the endearing name is used or the kiss bestowed; in law, without which the procedure of the courts would be impossible; in business, as any one will soon discover who tries to display conspicuous originality in making out a check. Of course, religion always has had its ceremonies and always will. Ritual is a kind of shorthand by which we say things that we do not take time to put into words or could not if we would. Its symbols body forth unutterable aspirations, gratitudes, devotions. Religion must have not only goodness and truth, but beauty. Nevertheless, a peril lurks in all ritualism—the supposition, namely, that the Lord God of this infinite universe cares <span id="p249"><sup><small>[ p. 249 ]</small></sup></span> anything about our meticulous performance of a ceremony, if it does not issue in private and public righteousness.

Nor does the liberal Christian belittle doctrine. The ordered and intelligible statement of the convictions which undergird Christian living is important. A man’s creed, if real and vital, is his conviction about the nature and meaning of his life, of the world in which it is lived, and of the God who rules it. That certainly is basic and controlling.

Centuries ago, could we have looked down on Europe, we should have seen the ships of even courageous mariners hugging the shore, Across the tossing waters to the west they looked with dread and, from port to port, close to the coast, they beat their way. They had in their minds a picture of the world as flat. To be sure, the earth was actually round, but the picture in their minds negatived the reality. That way of thinking was their creed and there — was no hope of adventurous voyaging until a new creed came, a larger and truer mental picture of the globe on which they lived.

So always a real creed, a controlling vision of what this earth is and what life means, which <span id="p250"><sup><small>[ p. 250 ]</small></sup></span> occupies the imagination and affects the life, is enormously important. If by doctrine one means this vital and influential outlook on life, then I should say that just now the need of the church is not for less doctrine but for more— more clear-cut, luminous, intelligible teaching about God, Christ, the Scriptures, the soul, the meaning of life, and immortality.

Only, there is an omnipresent danger in emphasis on doctrine. Doctrine in time is petrified into dogma. It is officially formulated. Then there is an ecclesiastical type of mind ready to use it, no longer as an inspiring elucidation of the convictions by which men really live, but as a mold into which men’s thinking must be exactly run. Doctrine is then authoritative, a definition laid down in times past of the way in which men must always think. And men often pride themselves on this repetition of their fathers’ thoughts, as though the God and Father of Jesus cared anything for that, except as it represents real convictions vitally issuing in private and public righteousness.

Furthermore, the liberal certainly does not undervalue the church. If instead of writing <span id="p251"><sup><small>[ p. 251 ]</small></sup></span> an essay I were talking to a rebellious youth, I should be defending the church. I should say:

> You are in revolt. You hate the church’s narrowness, its blindness to the great issues of our day, its wrangling over things that do not matter, its sectarianisms and its obscurantisms. Do ‘you think that you have more cause to be disgusted with the church than I have? I know more than you do about her faults and foibles, because I live with her all the time. Like a lawyer who knows better than the layman does the futile red tape and self-defeating technicalities of law courts and yet for all that believes in courts of law, so do I know the faults and follies of organized religion, but I believe in the church.
> 
> Leave for a moment those aspects of the church’s life that just now are continually flaunted in the papers, and for the sake of fairness think of those unpublished things which the church is always doing. In the darkest places on this planet, where else humanity would be helpless and sodden, you will find hospitals and schools and spiritual agencies. They are put there by the church. No other organization has thought of such service in those desperate corners of the earth except the church, and the men and women who sacrificially are serving there are the church’s gift. Show me an organization that can reduplicate our Careys and <span id="p252"><sup><small>[ p. 252 ]</small></sup></span> Morrisons and Adoniram Judsons and General Booths, their compeers and successors, who have gone where life is darkest, where need is deepest, where work is hardest, before you ask me to give up the church.
> 
> Do you want a man to sink his life in an Indian tribe or in the slums of New York, to run a hospital under the Arctic Circle in Alaska, or a school in the jungles of Africa? Do you want a man to do that who has had bestowed on him all that modern civilization can bestow—high heritage, culture, education? Do you want him to do it without hope of earthly reward, no money except bare subsistence, no comfort except what he can gain from an alien and inhospitable situation? Where will you look for that man? You will look to the church.
> 
> The noblest men and women I have ever known, the men and women that I should most choose to be like, have had their roots in the church. And the loveliest homes I ever have been in, homes that were bits of paradise on earth, one way or another have had upon them the influence of the church. Moreover, when my children grow up I want the church around them. I wish that it were better than it is but, even so, I want the church around my children.

So, against flippant contempt, one liberal at least would defend the church.

Nevertheless, the pathos of Christian history lies in the way the church has so often misrepresented <span id="p253"><sup><small>[ p. 253 ]</small></sup></span> and obstructed vital Christianity. Our multiplied and meaningless denominations are doing that to-day. In one of our American communities a congregation called itself The Church of God. They could not agree among themselves and, having split asunder, the split called itself, The True Church of God. They in turn divided and the new division called itself The Only True Church of God. The tragedy of that picturesque situation, too typical of our modern Protestantism to be pleasant, is that none of these divisions has any imaginable relationship with the one supreme business of religion: the creation of private and public righteousness.

This sort of thing is bad enough in America. It is a matter for tears in the missionary field. In spite of all the fine co-operations that have actually been wrought out, disheartening exhibitions of denominationalism still stare at a visitor in missionary lands. 'To see our Western sectarianism promulgated in the Far Kast is to witness one of the most tragic misapplications of consecrated energy that history records. As one of the missionary secretaries <span id="p254"><sup><small>[ p. 254 ]</small></sup></span> exclaimed, “Think of seeing an American Dutch Reformed Chinese!”

A liberal, therefore, in his emphasis is utterly careless of sectarian distinctions. He is by conviction and ideal an interdenominationalist. He deplores our divided Protestantism as a sin against God and against man. He sees that our denominational peculiarities for the most part are caused by historic reasons only, have no contemporary excuse for existence, and have no contribution to make to righteousness. He is convinced that nothing matters in any church except those few vital and transforming faiths and principles of the Gospel, common to all churches, which do create personal character and social progress.

## IV

To put the matter in another way, the liberal sees that much of so-called Christianity to-day is deflecting the attention of people from the real problems of the generation. ‘The reason for this is obvious. Religion makes sacred everything that it touches, great and small, from the priest’s heart to the pomegranates on <span id="p255"><sup><small>[ p. 255 ]</small></sup></span> the fringes of his robe. Tithing mint, anise, and cummin is made sacred by religion, as Jesus found—-so sacred that attention can be directed there until the ‘“‘weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith,” are neglected. ‘That has always been the danger of organized religion. It is the danger to-day.

The hardest thing for me personally to stand in the recent religious controversy has been its effect on many of our best youth. Some, to be sure, have enjoyed the spectacle, because it has been a fight. Others have been more seriously concerned with it, because they have seen that their hope of maintaining allegiance to the Christian church depends upon winning a victory for the freedom wherewith Christ hath made us free. But there is still another attitude among our best youth. It is as though they said:

> We have only one life to live. It looks to us as though it were going to be lived in a tremendous generation. In the next forty years humanity is going to face and answer some of the most momentous questions in its history. We propose to have a hand in the big business of our time. Do you think _ that we are going to line up with the church? Look at the questions over which the church is fighting— <span id="p256"><sup><small>[ p. 256 ]</small></sup></span> the inerrancy of ancient documents, the credibility of this or that event two thousand years past, the literal or loose acceptance of confessions of faith written by men like ourselves centuries ago, or apostolic succession and the administration of the sacraments. ‘These are not the real problems on which the weal or woe of humanity for centuries depends. If the church with unanimous enterprise were seeking to make Jesus Christ and all that he represents dominant in the personal and social life of men, that would be great business. If Christianity meant that, we should want to be Christians and should count it the greatest honor of our lives to be even a little worthy of the name. But the church does not seem to be chiefly intent on that aim. Once more she is deflecting the attention of people from the real problems of our time.

That is the serious and severe thing that many high-minded youth are thinking about denominational Christianity.

The determined desire of the liberals is to meet that charge by an adequate reformation of current religion which passes under the name of Christianity but often does not deserve it. Jesus Christ is to us the best gift of God to men, and the vital acceptance of him and his message is the door into richness of life for the individual and into progressive welfare <span id="p257"><sup><small>[ p. 257 ]</small></sup></span> for society. To make his faiths and ideals controlling in men’s lives seems to us the supreme task, as its consummation would be the supreme salvation. Nothing else centrally matters except that; everything else that matters at all gains its importance only as it contributes to that.

Such, I take it, are the two chief aims of Christian liberals: to think the great faiths of the Gospel through in contemporary terms, and to harness the great dynamics of the Gospel to contemporary tasks. If that be heresy the orthodox will have to make the most of it. For like a member of the Westminster — Assembly long ago, we are praying, “O God, we beseech Thee to guide us aright, for we are very determined,”
