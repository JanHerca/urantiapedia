## I

One of our American philosophers has recently written that “no great civilization has ever outlasted the demise of its religious faith,” That being true, the present upset, cantankerous and unhealthy state of religion in this couns try ought to be a matter of concern to all public-spirited minds. Religion is much more than a matter of conflicting sects and theologies; more even than a matter of individual piety; it is a public question of profound import.

No society ever has been healthy whose religious life was unhealthy. Even those who are impatient of contemporary formulations of faith, those who are outside the churches and alienated from their denominational loyalties, should still be deeply concerned about the fortunes of religion. A society which, providing for the future, builds great factories, immense railroad systems, and even innumerable schools, but does not care whether the future has a <span id="p276">[<sup><small>p. 276</small></sup>]</span> wholesome religious life, is playing a fatally short-sighted game.

In view of this fact, the situation which we face is serious. Much of our contemporary Christianity is not making people better, but worse, It accentuates bitterness, brings out meanness, sanctions ignorance and bigotry, divides those who might else be brotherly, and lapses from its high possibilities into a force for spiritual deterioration and decay. ‘That religion can thus become a curse and not a blessing is obvious. Religious faith, when it is in earnest, is very powerful. It puts behind men the most comprehensive motive that can sway them—the consciousness of obeying the eternal will. It leads men up to ways of thinking, acting, treating their fellows, and assures them that these are laws of God.

When, now, this religious dynamic furnishes driving power for beneficent living, it is a blessing; but when it is belted into the wrong factors in personal character and social life, the consequences are disastrous.

War in itself is bad enough, but a “holy war,” where the sanctions of religion are added to other motives for mutual hatred and slaughter, <span id="p277">[<sup><small>p. 277</small></sup>]</span> is the worst of all. Ignorance is always deplorable, but when through religion it becomes superstition, it gains a penetrating influence and an obdurate persistence that ordinary ignorance cannot attain. Prejudice is a common human fault, but it never is so malevolent as when, metamorphosed by religion into bigotry, it becomes a sacred duty. Obscurantism is almost universal; all men in some realm find it difficult to welcome progress; but when religion makes it a virtue, when men refuse the new boon of anesthetics because God decreed man’s suffering, or denounce efforts after international peace because the Bible says “Ye shall hear of wars,” or refuse to believe evolution true because the first chapter of Genesis does not teach it, or scorn scientific eugenics because control of life’s creative energies is God’s business, not ours, obscurantism is elevated into a holy obligation. The most deplorable attitudes and actions are constantly reenforced by religion, and some of history’s deepest abysses of moral ruin have been reached by those who, as Jesus said, thought that they did God Service.

Religion. like electricity, is ambiguous—it <span id="p278">[<sup><small>p. 278</small></sup>]</span> may illumine and warm or it may blast and ~ destroy.

When Saul of Tarsus held the clothes of Stephen while they stoned him, or headed in toward Damascus breathing threatenings and slaughter against the saints of God, what drove him on those bloody errands? Religion. And when he became all things to all men that by all means he might win some, and wrote, “If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal,” what motived that? Strangely enough, that was religion too. Religion can furnish support and sanction to the lowest as well as the highest elements in human character.

This dual possibility in religion was one of the central problems of the Master’s ministry. Neither Jesus nor any of his disciples ever met an atheist. Henever had to deal with theoretical irreligion. But he had constantly to deal with a low, unethical kind of religion that did people more harm than good.

In the parable of the Pharisee and the publican, where Jesus pictured two men praying in the temple, one boastfully thanking God <span id="p279">[<sup><small>p. 279</small></sup>]</span> that he was not as the rest of men, while the other humbly called on God for pardon and renewal, the Master explicitly contrasted good and bad religion. We may not like that scornful Pharisee, but we must admit that he was a very religious man. A churchgoer, a man of prayer. who talked familiarly with God, a grateful spirit, thankful that he was not like other men—he was exceedingly religious. As Jesus intimated, that was the trouble with him; he might have been a fairly decent character if his worst qualities had not been so made sacred by religion. Such appalling consequences follow when religious faith confirms and sanctifies the littleness, meanness and perversity of human character.

Indeed, this paper is being written on the anniversary of the Master’s crucifixion. There on the central Cross at Calvary, a sacrifice of illimitable consequence was made for man, and a great religious faith was its motive and sustainment. What force, then, raised the cry “Crucify him!” in Pilate’s court, and moved the wagging heads that scoffed at him upon the Cross? Strange duality of effect! That was religion too. It is a significant fact, whose application <span id="p280">[<sup><small>p. 280</small></sup>]</span> to Christendom has held true ever since, that what crucified Jesus was not irreligion, but bad religion.

## II

This ambiguous effect of religion constitutes to-day the crucial problem of the churches. We need a better quality of Christianity within our churches if we are to escape an increasing amount of irreligion outside them, and it is going to take superior religious leadership to— get it. No more important crusade for public welfare is afoot than that which seeks a type of Christianity which will make men large not small, sweet not bitter, intelligent not ignorant, better not worse.

For one thing, we need a kind of Christianity that will bring people together instead of tearing them apart. On a priori grounds no force in human life ought so to unite men as the religious consciousness that they are children of one Father. Nevertheless, a great deal of our contemporary Christianity constitutes one of the most embittering influences in our society. It does not weave men into a brotherhood; it <span id="p281">[<sup><small>p. 281</small></sup>]</span> does not mollify asperities, prejudices and hatreds; it rather baptizes them so that men indulge freely in their antipathies as a sacred duty.

In the constant endeavor of the churches ta persuade men to believe in God there has been an unfortunate forgetfulness of the fact that such belief is one of man’s most dangerous practices. When a man takes faith in God seriously, he has accepted a view of life as a whole. If, now, he believes God to be large, generous, and true, his faith is an incalculable benediction. But if he believes God to be small, parochial and mean, his view of life is perverted at its very center and his entire character is the worse for it.

Some people believe in a cruel God who has predestined his children to a hopeless torture chamber, and so their own cruelty toward those of whom they think God disapproves is confirmed and strengthened. Some believe in a tribal God who indulgently has chosen them as favorites, and so their own provincialism and narrow nationalism are deepened and sanctified. Some believe in a sectarian God who, as though he were a Gentile, hates Jews, or, being <span id="p282">[<sup><small>p. 282</small></sup>]</span> a Jew, hates Gentiles; who, as though he were a Protestant, dislikes Catholics, or, as a Catholic, dislikes Protestants; who, being even a Presbyterian, looks askance at Baptists, or, as a Baptist, looks askance at Presbyterians— and so all their own parochialism is made a sacred thing.

Much of our current religion, with its embittering effects, recalls the plaint of an Irishman over his divided country: “If we were all atheists we might live together like Christians.”

What Christianity does for some people is evident. It lifts them up to a great altitude. The sharp divisions that on lower levels seem important grow to their eyes diaphanous, transparent. Their fellowship with Christ brings his Golden Rule into luminous illustration in their lives, and his Sermon on the Mount is in them issued in its most attractive edition, bound in a man. Christianity makes some people generous, sympathetic, understanding, fraternal, and kind. What current Christianity, however, is doing for some others is only too clear. “We are going to fight for our convictions,” they say. “What we believe is true and all else is a lie, and we must fight <span id="p283">[<sup><small>p. 283</small></sup>]</span> it because it is a lie. The lines must be drawn sharp and clear; your convictions on that side, ours on this.”

The difficulty with that attitude does not lie in its insistence on convictions. Any mere kindliness which obscures the convinced. love of truth solves no problems. The difficulty is that when Christians stand up for their convictions in that pugnacious and cantankerous mood, they not only do not commend Christianity in general, they do not even commend their own convictions. Who in the end is going to be persuaded of the desirability of convictions which do that to a man’s spirit?

Standing up for one’s Christian convictions is too serious and sacred a matter to be caricatured. Standing up for one’s convictions can be perverted into bigotry, as though a man had first seen the sun through a chink in his log hut and thereafter insisted that no one ever could see the sun except by coming into his hut and looking through the chink. Standing up for one’s convictions can degenerate into the trivial sectarianism which now characterizes our denominations. As one witnesses such parochialism and bigotry masquerading under <span id="p284">[<sup><small>p. 284</small></sup>]</span> the sacred egis of loyalty to convictions, one understands anew that the perversion of the best is the worst.

The central problem of the human race today lies in the fact that we are being drawn close together physically while we are still far apart psychologically. The race desperately needs the active help of every force that will break through needless barriers, mollify exasperated antipathies, emphasize social unities, and lift the race over those perilous divisions where physical contact without spiritual understanding means ruin. Of all forces in the world religion ought to be foremost in this service; of all religions Christianity should be first. But much of our contemporary Christianity is not even helping; it is actually making a bad matter worse. It is accentuating old antipathies and creating new ones. It is employing the power which religion possesses to sanctify conduct to divide instead of unite men. This is a serious public matter. We are profoundly in need of a kind of Christianity that will draw men together and not tear them apart.

To be sure, there are communities where the ability of a wisely and generously directed <span id="p285">[<sup><small>p. 285</small></sup>]</span> Christianity to render this indispensable service is being finely exhibited. Such communities, united not divided by their religion, represent one of the great hopes of the church and of the nation. They constitute a challenge to a modern religious leadership that will multiply their number, increase their efficiency and intensify their effect.

Where Jesus himself would stand in this matter seems clear. He would undoubtedly be true to his convictions. He would be that with a rugged and uncompromising honesty which would make his life, if lived again, anything but peaceful. He would not spare his condemnations, although, as of old, they would fall exclusively on the trivialities and hypocrisies of religious leaders who tithe mint, anise, and cummin, and neglect the weightier matters of the law. But the total effect of his ministry would be again to break down barriers, overcome prejudices, dissolve antipathies, and unite men of every tongue, tribe, people and nation, Jew and Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond and free.

This problem of religious prejudice he faced too, and always in one way. He found people <span id="p286">[<sup><small>p. 286</small></sup>]</span> despising the Samaritans for reasons of race and orthodoxy; so he told one of his greatest stories and made a good Samaritan the hero of it. He found people hating Romans as pagans and oppressors; so he discovered one who had an excellent character and said, “I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” He saw people despising their neighbors, the Sidonians, as heathen; so he went into the synagogue, opened the Scriptures, and said, “There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah . . . and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.” 'The central orthodoxy of Jesus was love for all sorts of people, especially for those that other people had a prejudice against. It would be a redletter day in our generation if our current Christianity could be baptized with a little of the spirit of Christ.

## III

Again, we need a type of Christianity that will commend itself to the intelligence by distinguishing between the abiding convictions <span id="p287">[<sup><small>p. 287</small></sup>]</span> and experiences of the Christian life and the temporary forms of thought in which historically they have been set.

In every realm of life there are two sets of elements: those that change continually and those that change little, if at all. This is obvious, for example, in our homes. We have changed our habitations from tents to apartment houses, our clothes from loin-cloths and flowing robes to sack suits and modern garments, our servants from slaves to free laborers, our theories from polygamy to monogamy. Always human life is in transition, and ephemeral elements fade and fall away on every side. Nevertheless, in family life constant elements remain which shift but little with altering circumstances and theory.

Can a greater contrast be imagined than that between Isaac’s home and Mark Twain’s? Isaac, a Bedouin nomad millenniums ago, living in tents, traveling on camels, enduring the elemental simplicities and hardships of desert life, and Mark Twain, a typical modern, with his far-flung voyages, his university degrees, his household served by all the appurtenances of applied science—the contrast is sharp and <span id="p288">[<sup><small>p. 288</small></sup>]</span> clear. Yet put side by side the love stories of the two men, and one’s judgment changes. Here is Isaac’s rememberable experience: “And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her.’ And here is Mark Twain’s love story as he himself phrased it: “No man and woman really know what perfect love is until they have been married a quarter of a century.”

Differences between two such homes are many and deep, but how they dwindle in the radiance of that reproducible experience!

Exactly the same thing is true in religion. Religion’s garments, its habitations, its intellectual formulations, its theological vehicles are now and always have been in habitual flux. But at the heart of religion are the abiding and reproducible experiences of the soul, with itself, with its fellows, with its God. They bind the Christian centuries together; they make Paul, Augustine, Francis of Assisi, Luther, Wesley, Beecher our spiritual brothers in spite of all the differences that separate us; they can be repeated in all ages under all circumstances, with many sorts of intellectual formulations.

<span id="p289">[<sup><small>p. 289</small></sup>]</span>

Paul and Phillips Brooks were far apart in time and thought. Paul was trained at the feet of Gamaliel, and Phillips Brooks was trained in Harvard. Paul had behind him the background of orthodox Judaism, and Phillips Brooks had behind him the background of Puritan Boston. Paul was a citizen of the first century and thought in terms of cosmology, sociology, eschatology, and theology of his time, and Phillips Brooks was so much a liberal, even for the nineteenth century, that he was bitterly hated and opposed by conservative churchmen of his day. Yet if Paul and Phillips Brooks should ever meet, as perhaps they have met, they would find in common the deepest elements of their religious lives.

They both had found God in Christ and lived overarched and undergirded by his presence. They both had found sin’s forgiveness and sin’s conquest and had known a conscience void of offense toward God and man. They both had found in Christ the one who fascinated their adoration, commandeered their ambitions, determined their purposes so that they both could say, “To me to live is Christ.” They both had entered into the treasuries of Christian prayer <span id="p290">[<sup><small>p. 290</small></sup>]</span> and had found available resources for every day’s common needs. They both had found in the Gospel power to build character, humble, honest, courageous, serviceable, which in the place where God put them made a radiance that other men could walk by. And they both had passed out through death with open eyes that saw across the river the fields where the shining ones do commonly congregate.

The abiding factors that unite two far-separated Christian characters like Paul and Phillips Brooks are not the shifting formulations of theology, but the reproducible experiences of the soul. These are the creative forces in Christianity. From them have come our churches, creeds, rituals, and from them new churches, creeds, and rituals will come when old ones grow obsolete. For institutional and theological expressions of religion are its secondary elements, necessarily ephemeral now as they always have been, while the abiding continuum of Christianity remains in the repeatable experiences which are religion’s life.

The problem of religion for the younger generation to-day is largely bound up with the clear perception of this truth. There are many <span id="p291">[<sup><small>p. 291</small></sup>]</span> youths to-day, as always, whose alienation from Christianity is fundamentally moral, not intellectual; they are too vulgar, flippant, selfish, and carnal to be Christians. Nevertheless, at its best, youth to-day is not irreligious. Within living memory religion never was more mooted, never discussed more frankly, freely and earhestly on college campuses than it is to-day. But the new generation is unquestionably unconventional in its religion. Over increasingly wide areas it refuses to accept the old formulations or be reverent toward the old xhurches. It wants the life, but it will not accept it phrased in theologies that insult intelligence and in institutions that advertise in every distinctive emphasis of their denominational peculiarities that they are alien from this generation’s real problems and real needs. So far as the continuance of religion as a dominant motive in the life of intelligent youth is concerned, no more important enterprise is afoot than the endeavor to think and speak to this new generation about the reproducible experiences of the Christian Gospel in terms which the new generation can understand. Nevertheless, many people are having great <span id="p292">[<sup><small>p. 292</small></sup>]</span> difficulty in making this plain discrimination between the abiding convictions and experiences of religion and its historic formulations. They do not see that religion is a crustacean and that repeatedly a shell forms over it which, at first a serviceable instrument, becomes a fatal limitation. They identify the shell with the life. They try to keep the shell, supposing it indispensable to the life. They fear as dangerous innovators those who insist on sloughing off the shell and building a new one in order to preserve the life. They do not see that you never can keep life if you do not let it grow.

A long step forward toward a renewal of effective religion among our youth will be taken when once it is clearly recognized that the vital core and abiding continuwm of Christianity should be found, not in its constantly shifting frameworks of thought but in the reproducible experiences and convictions which our fathers thought about in their terms, which we are determined to think about in our terms, and which our children’s children should have liberty to think about in their terms.

In Nottingham, England, is the Wesleyan <span id="p293">[<sup><small>p. 293</small></sup>]</span> chapel where William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army, was converted. A memorial tablet keeps fresh in recollection the fact that there this notable friend of the friendless received his baptism of spiritual power. Naturally, the chapel has become a shrine of pilgrimage for Salvation Army leaders from around the world. One day an aged colored man in the uniform of the Army was found by the minister of the chapel standing with uplifted eyes before the tablet.

“Can a man say his prayers here?” he asked.

“Of course,” was the minister’s answer, “a man can say his prayers here.”

And the old Salvation Army officer went down on his knees and, lifting his hands before the tablet, prayed, ““O God, do it again! Do it again!”

That prayer is the touchstone of abiding reality in religion. The reproducible experiences concerning which men can pray across the centuries, in all sorts of mental settings, “Do it again!’ are the vital elements. Most of the things we have controversies over are not reproducible experiences; they are questionable historic events that nobody wants repeated; <span id="p294">[<sup><small>p. 294</small></sup>]</span> they are theories, formulations of historic theology, abstractions that will not affect in the least the richness, abundance, fruitfulness of any man’s spiritual life. They are not the core of religion. But to know the Unseen as an inward Friend, to be baptized by Christ with the ideal of service, to find in the available energies of the Spirit power for life so that what we ought to do we can do and what we must stand we can endure—O God, do it again!

Such repeatable experiences constitute vital religion, and to undertake the framing and presentation of them for this new generation in terms of thought that this generation can understand is an indispensable enterprise calling for the highest qualities of religious leadership.

## IV

Finally, we need a kind of Christianity that will send men out courageously to apply their Christian principles to our social, industrial, and international order, instead of soothing them to sleep with sentimental optimism born ~ of a false trust in God.

<span id="p295">[<sup><small>p. 295</small></sup>]</span>

One of the most considerable criticisms of contemporary religion comes not from skeptics, materialists, intellectual rebels, but from devoted servants of the common good who are trying to make this world a more decent place for man to live in. What they often say is that our current Christianity is making some people lazy, useless, soft, foolishly optimistic and therefore socially apathetic, whereas without their religion they might have been intelligently serviceable.

The explanation of this serious charge— the more serious because of the quality of the people that it comes from—is not difficult to see. Our Christian idea of God is very beautiful. We reach it by lifting up the noblest qualities of character we know and affirming them of God. We take the finest adjectives we can lay our minds on—merciful, gracious, good, kind, righteous—and, raising them to the superlative degree, we affix them to our idea of God. Then we believe that this universe was made and is being managed by this unspeakably good God and by him will be brought to its triumphant destiny.

One possible consequence of such faith is <span id="p296">[<sup><small>p. 296</small></sup>]</span> immediately evident. If this universe is in the hands of such a being, why should we worry about it? If Omnipotent Goodness is in charge of creation, why is not the most complete and happy optimism about everything entirely justifiable? Religion so taken becomes an armchair philosophy. People nestle comfortably in it and doze off, trusting God. This, so some high-minded social servants say, is the lamentable effect of much popular religion, and seeing what problems face us affecting the destiny of humankind for centuries ahead and never to be solved without patient, intelligent, sustained thought and toil, they do not rely on popular Christianity to help; they fear it instead, as a soporific.

Of course, a vigorous protest against this charge is possible. Some of us would say that trusting God at its best has not meant somnolence, but that from it have come the most splendid courage and aggressive consecration that history has seen. We should insist that real faith is not an anodyne, an anesthetic, but, as Jesus said, a mountain-mover. We should be sure that Christians at their best have trusted God as mariners trust the magnetic <span id="p297">[<sup><small>p. 297</small></sup>]</span> pole, not as an excuse for relaxed effort, but as a basis for hazardous exploits; that they have trusted God as a nation trusts a great leader, in a crucial time, not as a pillow to recline upon, but as a standard around which to rally and stand strong.

All this, I think, is true, but we face here another exhibition of our thesis, that while religion going right is a powerful benediction, going wrong it is a dangerous influence. Listen to some public servant impatient with the lamentable apathy of Christians who make trust in God an excuse and not a challenge, as he honestly speaks his mind:

> Multitudes of you Christians are using faith in God as a bed to sleep upon. When you meet social ills demanding concentrated thought and work, you are not deeply disturbed; you trust God. When you face international situations like those through which we now lightly trip to possible perdition, you are not deeply and sustainedly concerned; you trust God. Even if, during the week, we do wake you up by poignant revelations of social need, there is always Sunday in the church, light through stained windows, soothing music, and a comfortable sermon on the goodness of God to put you to sleep again. In the Kremlin, at Moscow, over against an old shrine <span id="p298">[<sup><small>p. 298</small></sup>]</span> where millions of worshipers have habitually come, is hanging now a banner with a motto from Karl Marx, “Religion is the opiate of the people.” If we could refuse recognition to Moscow religiously, as we can politically, that might not worry us, but that banner’s motto says what an increasing number of our own youth are tempted to think. Why, they say, forty-six million Christians in the United States and so little crusading for the principles that Jesus Christ lived and died for? Why this half-ruined and belligerent Western world after nearly two thousand years of so-called Christianity with its trust in God? No more of that kind of faith which lulls us to sleep with sentimental optimism because God is good.

This mood of protest against false religion is deepening in the very people who most would value and profit by true religion, and the call for a modern religious leadership that will cease misusing trust in God is acute and clamorous. We cannot trust God to break his own laws. We cannot trust God to keep a ship off the rocks when the mariner has missed his reckoning. We cannot trust God to save a railroad train from wreck when the engineer has run past his signals. We cannot trust God to keep us in health when we break the laws of health. We cannot even trust God to make <span id="p299">[<sup><small>p. 299</small></sup>]</span> our children Christians if we neglect their religious education. This is true and it ought to be true, but it makes the business of living a stern enterprise. In particular, we cannot trust God to save any society or nation or civilization whose members are not exercising intelligent, public-spirited, sacrificial consecration in the solution of its problems. Our fathers would have put that truth into austere language. They would have said that God is good indeed, but that, for all that, men and nations can go to hell. Our fathers, with their sterner creed, were less tempted than we are to make a pillow of their faith, What is more, our fathers had severe truth behind their words. This is no foolproof universe. You cannot trust God to save negligent, careless, lazy, idle, and foolish men and societies.

A Christianity that will face social problems, accept the challenge of Jesus Christ, take him seriously, believing with him that the universe is spiritually grounded and purposed and that his ideals can be wrought out in a kingdom on earth where God’s will is done as it is in heaven—that is one of the supreme tasks of modern religious leadership. It is a costly undertaking. <span id="p300">[<sup><small>p. 300</small></sup>]</span> It means a crusade for a warless world and for an economic order which values personality more than money, and counts public service a higher aim than private profits. But no other kind of Christianity is adequate for the world’s need. Faith in God in the New Testament is not an anesthetic; it is the victory that overcometh the world. ‘Tc recover that kind of faith is one of the supreme needs of contemporary religion.

Such is the call for a modern religious leadership. It ought to challenge our best youth. The nation’s life never will be healthy until such goals have been achieved. A Christianity that, retaining its abiding spiritual values, increases capacity for co-operation, takes intelligent account of new truth, and tackles the serious problems of personal character and social relationships is a sine qua non of real prosperity in America.
