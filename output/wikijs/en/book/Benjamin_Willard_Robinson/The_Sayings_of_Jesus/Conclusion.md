The healthy human soul searches persistently after the highest and fullest life. Every noble character seeks to rise above physical and material things into a life of the spirit. Men and women strive to find eternal and lasting values. The eternal spirit, which is the heart of the world and of life, men call God.

Jesus entered into close fellowship with God. He formed the habit of calling him Father. He communed with him, day after day. He became a revelation of God to men. In Jesus, men have come to recognize that God is love, that the highest and most abiding power in the universe is not hate, but kindness, not war, but peace. The religion of Jesus can and will save the world and prepare men for the better age to come.

Jesus has shown men and women how to find God. Jesus is himself the way. He “went about doing good.” Devoted men and women of the twentieth century will carry on the great work. Anyone who makes it the aim of his life to preserve his own self will rapidly lose his soul, but the man who pours out his soul in the service of others and loses himself in the cause of human brotherhood will find himself and attain to fullness of life.
