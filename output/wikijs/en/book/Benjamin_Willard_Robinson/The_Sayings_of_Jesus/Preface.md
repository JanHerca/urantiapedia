There are many books on the history of the Jews in the time of Jesus. Many also are the books on the teachings of Jesus. Very few, however, are the volumes which attempt the obvious task of bringing the two together. Either the history is given at length with a bare sketch of Jesus, or the message of Jesus is more fully given and the history is so abbreviated that the teaching is not seen in its true perspective. The purpose of this volume is so to present both subjects in sufficient detail that the gem of Jesus’ religion will be seen in that appropriate and adequate setting which will enable the modern reader to appreciate its full value and beauty.

In translating the sayings of Jesus, the author has not hesitated to make use of previous translations. Edgar J. Goodspeed’s “New Testament” is especially recommended. Some quotations from Jewish sources are allowed to retain, more or less, their archaic flavor. At times, even the use of “Thou” and “Thee” is retained. This is done for the purpose of bringing out by contrast the informality and personal directness of Jesus’ words.

To those who have preceded in the historical study of Jesus of Nazareth this volume owes much. “Others have labored and ye are entered into their labors.” To his colleague Professor Wilhelm Pauck for help in reading the proofs the author feels a special sense of obligation. To every comrade who has had a hand in preparing the manuscript or in setting the type or in finishing the book hearty thanks are here expressed.
