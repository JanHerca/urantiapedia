<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> We're back with a summary of the notable changes made to Urantiapedia this past month. :pensive: It's been a very unproductive month for various reasons, but we're still trying to achieve our goals. :pray:

## :page_with_curl: Articles (The Urantiapedia Newsletter Archive)

The publication of “Le Lien” is proving to be extraordinarily extensive and laborious, so we are continuing with it and it has been our main focus of attention in this last month.

In November we will begin to share time between the Urantian [Newspaper Library](/en/article) and the [Book Library](/en/book). There is still work to be done in the Newspaper Library, but we do not want that to prevent us from starting with other parts and content.

## :blue_heart: Collaboration

We have significantly improved some parts of the [Urantiapedia Help](/en/help), especially the one dedicated to potential collaborators who wish to help with the following tasks:

- [Creation of a catalog of books of all religions](/es/help/github_religious_books_catalog)
- [Getting books of all religions](/en/help/github_religious_books_markdown)
- [“Source” books catalog](/en/help/github_sourcebooks_catalog)
- [Getting “source” books](/en/help/github_sourcebooks_markdown)
- [Articles catalog](/en/help/github_articles_catalog)
- [Getting articles](/en/help/github_articles_markdown)

We are still in a precarious situation regarding collaborations, so we hope that renewed explanations of how the project works can clarify for potential collaborators how they can help and also show how easy it really is to do this work.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

The number of users has risen again, returning to the path of months ago, although without major changes in the rest of the parameters.
