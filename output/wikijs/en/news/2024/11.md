<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Here we are one more month with the latest news about this website. We are in the final stretch of 2024 and this is undoubtedly going to be the year with the most changes on Urantiapedia. The last few weeks the server has been at full capacity, smoking with the hundreds and hundreds of new pages that we are creating. We are going at such a pace that Urantiapedia will probably end the year as a website with more than 90,000 pages. :open_mouth: 

## :page_with_curl: Articles (The Urantiapedia Newspaper Library) 

The publication [«Le Lien»](/fr/index/articles_le_lien) is completely uploaded in French and we are actively working to have the Spanish and English translations available, something that will happen throughout the month of December. This publication is without a doubt the most extensive one that has been uploaded to Urantiapedia, with close to a thousand articles in total across all the issues issued to date. 

Once the publication of «Le Lien» is completed, we will continue uploading more content to the [Newspaper Library](/en/article). There are still some publications missing to upload as well as updating publications to current and old issues that are not uploaded. 

## :books: Books (The Urantiapedia Library) 

We have resumed work on the [Library](/en/book) during this month of November. The entire section on [English books of Islam](/en/index/books_islam) is now available for the first time on Urantiapedia. This section contains about 40 Islamic religious books that allow a closer look at the beliefs and teachings of this great world religion. 

During the month of December we will continue this work by uploading translations of all the books of Islam into Spanish and French. There is a work by a reader of _The Urantia Book_ that draws parallels between it and the [_Quran_](/en/book/Islam/Quran), and we want to upload that work as well in a similar way to how we have already done with the _Bible_. Finally, there are many other books that we have ready and waiting to be uploaded to Urantiapedia. This will be our focus in the coming months. 

## :card_index: The Topical Index (The _Urantia Book_ Encyclopedia)

We are updating the _Urantiapedia Tools_ application in order to automate the creation of entries in this Encyclopedia as much as possible. One of the additions we are adding is the ability to edit the Encyclopedia in three parallel columns, in English, Spanish, and French, so that each term is edited at the same time in all three languages. This will greatly reduce work time.
