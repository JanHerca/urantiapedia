<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> It’s the last month of the year and it’s time to not only recap what we’ve added this month but also take a look at what the entire year has been like on Urantiapedia. Needless to say, 2024 has undoubtedly been the year of the greatest progress on this project by far. Not only has the amount of content increased significantly, but the speed at which this content is being added has increased as well. A good part of the justification for this speed is that there are only three months left to complete the plan we laid out for [Urantia Foundation](https://www.urantia.org/) for the [Mustard Seed program](https://www.urantia.org/news/2023-03/mustard-seed-grants-program). This program has undoubtedly been a constant incentive and stimulus to work hard on the project, and it will allow us to achieve much greater goals in much less time than we initially thought.

But it is time to tell all this in detail.

## :page_with_curl: Newsletters Library

The publication [“Le Lien”](/en/index/articles_le_lien) is completely uploaded in English, Spanish and French.

The Newsletters Library is not yet complete, there is a lot of content that we want to upload, but this month we have focused mainly on the other parts of the project. The coming months will continue to receive additions.

## :books: Books Library

All [books of Islam](/en/index/books_islam) are available in English, Spanish, and French. We have also added parallels between the [Quran](/en/book/Islam/Quran) and _The Urantia Book_, which appear at the end of each paper in _The Book_. These parallels are based on the work of some readers and are a work in progress.

A book by Charles Hartshorne that was in English and Spanish has now been added in French: [La vision de l'homme de Dieu et de la Logique du théisme](/fr/book/Charles_Hartshorne/Mans_Vision_of_God). This book was the first one we tested adding parallels to the end of each paper in _The Urantia Book_. We have added all the parallels that were left to be added for this book, and have added them in English, Spanish, and French.

The Library will continue to grow in the coming months with many more books we have in progress relating to other religions, philosophy, and science. We will also be updating the information on parallels to these books to make it as useful as possible.

## :card_index: Urantia Book Encyclopedia

All [Encyclopedia](/en/topic) entries beginning (in English) with the letters [A](/en/index/topics#a), [B](/en/index/topics#b), [C](/en/index/topics#c), [D](/en/index/topics#d), [E](/en/index/topics#e), and [F](/en/index/topics#f), plus a [number](/en/index/topics), are completed in English, Spanish, and French. We will continue with the remaining entries in the coming months. We hope to complete the first version of the Encyclopedia in April 2025.

The Encyclopedia currently has over 4,400 entries in each language, so adding French is taking time. We are uploading several hundred pages to the website every day, which puts the Urantiapedia server at its limit. It should be noted that the content upload is done in the background so as not to compromise the response speed when users request a page. This content upload will continue at this pace in the coming months because behind the Encyclopedia we have hundreds of pages with content ready for the Library.

For the development of the Encyclopedia we are greatly improving the _Urantiapedia Tools_ application, a software developed to speed up the content creation processes and which is fully _opensource_ in the [project](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia).

## :wrench: Urantiapedia Tools

We have introduced many improvements to _Urantiapedia Tools_ this month:
* Improvements to the translation functionality with Google Cloud specific to books, such as detecting elements on the cover page of books, or verse and page numbers, etc.
* Improvements to the translation functionality to be able to detect potential errors in the cost estimation phase. Viewing errors allows for translation tests without consuming credits on the Google server.
* Bug fixes in the Encyclopedia functionality:
  * “See also” (links to other terms) and references within the lines of a term can now be used correctly.
  * French accented characters can now be used for word detection.
* New functionality in the Encyclopedia (_Topic Index Editor_):
  * New filter to filter out terms that are redirects or to exclude them.
  * New filter to load terms by the number of lines they contain.
  * Full load when no filter is applied. Allows editing externally and then reloading to see changes reflected.
  * Ability to work with three languages ​​at a time (previously limited to only two).
  * Reduced size of the shortcuts panel to give the application more space.
  * Use of templates made with _Pug_ to simplify the use of multiple languages.
  * Integration of OpenAI to be able to resolve Encyclopedia content using ChatGPT 4o. The current content is sent along with the text of _The Urantia Book_ that should be referenced, and ChatGPT returns a result, in many cases quite close to the correct result. (See the example screen.)
* New error detection process in the Encyclopedia, with many more types of errors detected than in the previous existing process. We now detect errors such as:
  * If a term does not contain the same content in the other encyclopedias in another language (compares all existing ones two by two).
  * If a term contains a “see also” that is not found (and a possible solution is offered for non-English encyclopedias)
  * Better detects whether a term exists in a reference (for example, it takes into account that in French an apostrophe is sometimes used, as in _l'égalité_) and better sorts the matching texts.
* New process for generating the page layout for a book based on a file containing the cover and the table of contents.
* Improvement that allows adding footnotes to article indexes.
* Improved placement of links in the Encyclopedia, avoiding excessive repetition.

## :wrench: Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is our recommended application for daily work with Urantiapedia. Not only does it integrate seamlessly with [GitHub](https://github.com/), where we host the [project](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia), but it also has many very useful extensions for working with formats that we use massively in Urantiapedia, such as HTML and Markdown. This month we have further improved the use of Visual Studio Code:

**Extension for Visual Studio Code that colors the syntax of the Encyclopedia files.**

This extension, created by ourselves, allows you to apply a color style to the TXT files that contain the Encyclopedia entries, files that are located in the `input/txt/topic-index-xx` path of the project. It allows you to show errors and make these long files more readable.

**Microsoft Copilot extension that integrates OpenAI into daily work**

Copilot is Microsoft's name for a range of software integrated into all of its productivity applications with the aim of bringing AI functionality into our daily work with our files. In VS Code, Microsoft has created an extension that integrates the typical chat of applications such as ChatGPT into VS Code, and also has an integrated suggestion system. This tool is proving invaluable in working with Urantiapedia. The system is contextual and learns from the content of Urantiapedia to formulate increasingly precise and accurate responses about what we want to do.

## :fireworks: 2024 in retrospect

Some data reflecting the enormous progress this year:

- **GitHub** (main project)
    * The project has received 1,466 commits during the year, twice as many as in the entire year of 2023 :sunglasses:
    * It has received 10,723,108 additions and 2,488,242 deletions (this refers to modified lines!). :dizzy_face:

<figure id="img_4" class="image urantiapedia">

<figcaption><em>Evolution of the number of commits </em></figcaption>
</figure>

- :page_facing_up: **Pages** : Urantiapedia already has 78,087 pages created. We've added 19,124 new pages this year. :open_mouth: And there are no less than 4,000 more being uploaded right now.

- :page_with_curl: **Articles** (**Newspaper Library**) : Last year we ended up publishing 3,697 articles in English, 1,355 in Spanish, and practically nothing in French. This year we have 5,306 articles in English, Spanish, and French. :ok_hand: Take a look at the [Index by Publication](/en/index/articles).

- :books: **Books** (**Library**): We currently have 204 books in English, 204 in Spanish, and 192 in French. Last year we had nothing in French, and we have almost doubled the number of books in Spanish and English. The goal is still to add a library of about 700 books. Take a look at the [Index of All Book Groups](/en/index/books).

- :notebook: **Study Aids**: We currently have 31 study aids in English, 31 in Spanish, and 24 in French. Over the next few months, the content will be completed and made equal across all three languages. Take a look at the [Index of Study Aids](/en/index/study_aids).

- :card_index: **Encyclopedia** (also somewhat erroneously called the _Topic Index_): When the first version of the Encyclopedia is complete it will contain over 4,400 entries available in English, Spanish, and French. We currently have 1,495 entries in each of the three languages ​​that have already received a complete review, which is one-third of the total planned for the first version. The plan is to complete this first version by April 2025. :+1: Check out the [Index of all terms](/en/index/topics).

- :blue_book: **The Urantia Book**: We have finally included the [Publication Mandate](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate) in English, Spanish, and French, a long-standing omission that is now remedied. An effort has also been made to include a hyperlink everywhere on Urantiapedia where this paper is mentioned.

- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **The Jesus of Nazareth Novel Project**: This project by Jan Herca, founder of Urantiapedia, aims to create a novel about the life of Jesus inspired by the fourth part of _The Urantia Book_, and to freely publish that novel on Urantiapedia, available to the general public. It is a work in progress that is done little by little when the rest of the project's tasks allow it. :blush: Check out the [Cover Page](/es/book/Jan_Herca/Jesus_of_Nazareth), available at the moment only in Spanish.

- :blue_heart: **Urantiapedia Help**: We have significantly improved some parts of the [Urantiapedia Help](/en/help), especially the one dedicated to potential collaborators who wish to help with some of the open tasks.
