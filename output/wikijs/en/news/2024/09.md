<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Another month here is the summary of everything that has changed this last month on Urantiapedia.

## :page_with_curl: Articles (The Urantiapedia Newsletter Archive)

We are continuing to upload two publications in French: “Réflectivité” and “Le Lien.” These newsletters are becoming much longer than expected. “Réflectivité” has been published for many years and is by far the longest publication ever made relating to _The Urantia Book_. “Le Lien” already has over 100 issues published, all of them no less than 20 pages long. The volume of articles, essays, opinion pieces and poetry in this magazine is probably the largest of all the publications we have added to Urantiapedia to date.

Work on these two publications will continue this October until we complete the upload of all the issues, at which time we will conclude the first version of the [Newspaper Library of _The Urantia Book_](/en/article).

## :blue_heart: Collaboration

The work on Urantiapedia is enormous and it is impossible to do it with a limited group of people. This month we have updated the page that explains the [principles that govern Urantiapedia](/en/help/principles) and among those principles you will see that one of the basic pillars of the project is collaboration and teamwork. For that reason this project is designed using web tools that allow hundreds of people to work together simultaneously.

Unfortunately, requests for collaboration have been declining over time to the point that we have received almost no help for months. There are occasional and rare exceptions, but in general this project is moving forward thanks to the joint work of no more than two people. This is sad and worrying. Without a much larger team, this web service will not be able to continue pursuing its objectives in the near future.

That is why we encourage all those who read this news section to contact us and decide to collaborate. There are two very simple ways to send us contributions to Urantiapedia:
- The first is via email at **urantiapedia@gmail.com**. Here you can send new content that you think is missing or corrections to errors that you have found, especially in the automatic translations that we are doing. To send a correction, you just need to indicate an extract of the paragraph that you see incorrect and add which words are wrong and how they should be displayed. If you also indicate the web address of the page with the error, that also helps, but it is not essential.
- Another very simple way is **[GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia)**. You can create a free account on this platform, create a copy of the project, make changes to the project files, adding or modifying files, and then commit your changes. All of this can be done directly from the GitHub website and at no cost. In addition, there is no risk in these operations; you always work on your own copy of the project. There is an explanation about all of this in the [help](/en/help/github_assistant) but if you need more clarification on how it works, do not hesitate to contact us at urantiapedia@gmail.com.

Current collaborations should focus on the two major blocks or milestones we are currently working on, which are the [Urantia Book Newspaper Library](/en/article), and the [Urantia Book Library](/en/book). In these links you can find information about the purpose of these two major elements of the project and where their contents are located and organized. In the near future, when these milestones are completed, we will move on to focus on the [Urantia Book Encyclopedia](/en/topic) (which we sometimes mistakenly call the _Topic Index_ on Urantiapedia). And we also have other milestones planned for the future, such as a _Urantia Book Map Library_ and a _Urantia Book Media Library_. You can find out more about all the planned [milestones in the project](/en/help/phases) here. But we would appreciate it if for the moment anyone would send us content by email or GitHub and focus only on the two major blocks currently in progress.

We should also mention that the project is currently moving forward primarily in three languages: English, French and Spanish. But nothing should stop any contributor who would like to add content in other languages ​​by translating what is already in those three languages ​​or adding original content in another language. We currently have 25 languages ​​registered, in which at least _The Urantia Book_, the _Bible_ and the _Paramony_ (the cross-references between the two) have already been added. We will soon add Chinese and Arabic as well. Contribution in any of these languages ​​is completely open to all who wish to participate.

From here, our thanks in advance to all those who sign up for this exciting project. :heart: :heartbeat:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

We see from the data that the parameters have risen again to values ​​similar to those of two months ago and are even better now, which seems to indicate that the decline of the last month was only a temporary situation and the upward trend continues.
