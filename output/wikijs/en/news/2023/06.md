<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> This month has been a bit quieter than usual :sunrise:, focused on a few tasks. The _The Urantia Book_ editions in multi-language version that remain to be uploaded have not yet been able to be added, but will be soon. This month we have focused mainly on the addition of :page_with_curl: articles and magazines in both English and Spanish, a task that we will continue to focus on in the following quarter.

## Articles

The [Mighty Messenger](/en/index/articles_mighty_messenger) magazine of the [Fellowship](https://urantiabook.org/) is available on Urantiapedia. At the moment it has been uploaded in its original in English and in the next few days we will finish uploading its translation into Spanish. The issues that have been uploaded are all those that have been located using various websites that offer copies of the newsletter in some format. Working with these publications is complex because in many cases the format in which they are found is a scanned image of the paper originals, and because these publications contain a lot of graphic material that we intend to keep the same in our version on Urantiapedia.

To facilitate our work with this publication conversion process, we have contracted a new service called [Snip Web](https://snip.mathpix.com/) from the company [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/). This software allows conversions from PDF to Markdown format and is even capable of converting [handwritten text](https://mathpix.com/handwriting-recognition) and [scientific texts](https://mathpix.com/docs/mathpix-markdown/overview) in Markdown :muscle:. [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) is a very important format on Urantiapedia, as can be seen in [our help](/en/help/web_markdown_editor). It is a _de facto_ standard in the web industry and can replace [HTML](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) in many tasks. The advantage of Markdown over HTML is that it is a very compact and fast-to-use format that allows you to create complex web content much faster than HTML. It should be made clear, however, that this is a format that is used internally on our website. The end result that the user's browser receives is always HTML.

We have identified a significant number of publications in English, Spanish and French that we want to bring to Urantiapedia. The goal with all this work is to link these contents to _The Urantia Book_ so that links to the publications appear at the bottom of each paper in the book just as links to the Bible already appear. We hope to start this task of linking with the magazines this coming month. 

## Collaboration 

The translation work is being done by automatic procedures and we need collaborators who want to review these translations. If you wish to collaborate with us in this task, or are interested in Urantiapedia, you can send us an email at urantiapedia@gmail.com. :mailbox: From here goes our thanks to the collaborators who are currently helping us in the detection of errors.

## Statistics

From now on in Urantiapedia News we will offer statistical information of the page during the last month :chart_with_upwards_trend:. In this way we can show how acceptance and interest in our website is turning out. 

The objective that we set ourselves for the project presented to the [Mustard Seed Program](https://www.urantia.org/news/2023-03/mustard-seed-grants-program) of [Urantia Foundation](https://www.urantia.org/) was: 
- 40,000 sessions and 30,000 users per year 
- Number of recurring users greater than 20% 
- Bounce rate less than 60% 
- Average interaction time greater than 2 minutes

These are the objectives set for the next two years, 2023 and 2024. As you can see in the following table of statistics, we are still far from meeting these objectives, but it is a start. As can be seen, the number of new users has grown a lot in the last month, and the average interaction time is well above expectations, more than 4 minutes, which indicates that our users spend time reading content and not merely browsing it.

We believe that the new content that we will be adding shortly, the link between the publications and _The Urantia Book_, will draw much more attention to the project because of the tremendous opportunities this new functionality will bring to the community of _The Urantia Book_ readers.
