<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Here is a summary of the most significant changes to Urantiapedia over the past month.

## :books: The Library

We have added a new science book to the Library: _A Textbook of Geology, Part II - Historical Geology_, by Charles Schuchert, now available in [English](/en/book/Charles_Schuchert/A_Text_book_of_Geology_Part_II), [Spanish](/es/book/Charles_Schuchert/A_Text_book_of_Geology_Part_II), and [French](/fr/book/Charles_Schuchert/A_Text_book_of_Geology_Part_II).

This book, aside from its interest to readers of _The Urantia Book_ due to the parallels it contains, has been used to test the new translation functionality of _Urantiapedia Tools 2.0_, which is detailed below.

## :wrench: Urantiapedia Tools

As mentioned in previous months, a new version of the _Urantiapedia Tools_ software, version 2.0, is under development. Unlike the current version, which is hosted on the Urantiapedia project itself on GitHub, this version now has its [own project on GitHub](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-tools). This separation facilitates development and keeps everything more organized. It is developed with modern web technologies ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)) and follows a more organized and maintainable development pattern. Virtually all the functionality of _Urantiapedia Tools 1.0_ has already been ported to the new version. The translation section has been significantly improved, enabling the rapid translation of hundreds of web pages at zero cost. This new development allows for two-step translation through a semi-manual process that also automatically corrects common errors made by AI applications typically used in translation.

It has been verified that the new system accelerates translation work tenfold, especially in the error-checking phase. This aspect will be further improved over time by incorporating more automated correction systems to prevent the typical inconsistencies that occur when using AI-based translation systems, such as [Google Translator](https://translate.google.es/) or [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/es/translator). The advantage of the current system is that we can translate dozens of books and hundreds of articles in a single day with high-quality translation but without incurring any additional costs for the project. Previously, translating books and articles cost hundreds of dollars each month, and that will no longer be necessary.
