<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> We continue another month moving forward with the [Newspaper Archive](/en/index/articles). Although a great deal of content has been added to this section of Urantiapedia in the last year, there are still a large number of articles and works available that we want to add to make the Newspaper Archive as complete as possible. We will work on it. :ant: :ant:

## :page_with_curl: The Newspaper Archive

This month we have completed uploading the articles and papers from the Urantia Association of Spain website, in [English](/en/index/articles_spain), [Spanish](/es/index/articles_spain) and [French](/fr/index/articles_spain) :clap: :clap:. This is a total of about 170 documents, some of a certain length, both originals from Spanish-speaking readers and translations into Spanish by other authors. Even so, it does not include by far all the content available on the Spanish association's website. For now we are only uploading text-based content. The presentations and diagrams will be uploaded in the future, since we must first find a suitable medium to share this type of content on Urantiapedia that meets our requirements of being easily translatable into other languages and conveniently consumable from mobile devices.

We have also added the study aid [«Bill Sadler Talks» (spanish)](/es/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Bill_Sadler_Talks), which was available in [English](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Bill_Sadler_Talks) and [French](/fr/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Bill_Sadler_Talks), but was missing in Spanish.

Finally, we have fixed bugs with broken links and incorrect formatting in many articles.

## :books: The Library

We have added a book by Tom Maringer to the Library, in the readers' books section: in English, [A Day in the Life of a Mansion Worlds Student](/en/book/Tom_Maringer/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_a_Mansion_Worlds_Student); in Spanish, [Un día en la vida de un estudiante de los mundos mansión](/es/book/Tom_Maringer/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_a_Mansion_Worlds_Student); in French, [Une journée dans la vie d'un étudiant des mondes des maisons](/fr/book/Tom_Maringer/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_a_Mansion_Worlds_Student).

We plan to add many more books to this section, both directly to Urantiapedia if the author allows, and by linking to where they can be purchased. Time will tell. :relaxed:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

After the spectacular increase in users last month, motivated by the inclusion of Urantiapedia in the [Foundation newsletter](https://www.urantia.org/news/2025-07/mustard-seed-grant-project-urantiapedia), especially among North American users, the numbers have stabilized back to previous levels. We are struck by the number of users coming to Urantiapedia from Asia, which is not sufficiently reflected in these statistics because we usually show the highest numbers. This has made us rethink the project's next goals, as we have been seeing this continued interest for some time, and we have decided to focus in the coming months on adding content to Urantiapedia in Chinese, Arabic, and Korean. We have long intended to start working in these three languages, and now this work is finally going to materialize. :heart:
