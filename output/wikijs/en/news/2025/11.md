<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> Another month has passed, and here we are with all the new features we've added to Urantiapedia.

## New Languages

​​Urantiapedia is now available in [Croatian](/hr/home)! :tada: :clap: This brings the number of supported languages ​​to 28. In this language, as we have done with most, we have included The Urantia Book, the Bible, the Paramony (or cross-references between The Urantia Book and the Bible), the home pages, and legal information. With this, Urantiapedia now contains all languages ​​with at least one available translation of The Urantia Book.

## :blue_book: The Urantia Book

We have finished updating The Urantia Book in all languages, correcting some errors we had, as well as improving the number of translations:
- All documents of The Urantia Book are now available in all languages ​​(28 currently).
- All languages ​​finally have the multi-column version available with the original English version and the translated version.
- A multi-column version has also been added to the English language (so now all languages ​​have one). The English multi-version displays both the current version and the original 1955 version. The current version includes some minor changes and errata corrections.
In the Korean, Russian, French, and Spanish multi-versions, we have added new alternative translations. There are four translations available in Korean, two in Russian, two in French, and four in Spanish.
We have corrected some special paragraphs in *The Urantia Book* that are simply paragraph separators, marked with asterisks (***). These paragraphs are either these or are found after these: [UB 31:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_21), [UB 56:10.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_22), [UB 120:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p3_11), [UB 134:6.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p6_14), [UB 144:5.11-87](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p5_11). These paragraphs now have the same references as the official ones in the publications of the [Urantia Foundation](https://urantia.org).
- We have decided that section 139:9 (James and Jude, Alphaeus) does not exist, and the existing section is [UB 139:10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10) to provide a unified way to access this atypical section.
- We have included the names of the authors of the documents in the compact index.
- We have included some additions in the extended index within the sections that appear in the official index. These additions were found only for English and Spanish. In the other languages, a translation was done from English.
- Some adjustments have been made to the typography in Korean.


## :books: The Library

In the [Library](/en/index/books) we have begun processing the remaining biblical books to be uploaded (the Apocryphal books) in almost all languages. Currently, they are only available in English, Spanish, and French. The goal is to make these books available in the Library in all languages. This process will require an update to the _Urantiapedia Tools_ and _Wikijs_ software to allow creating and uploading these files at a faster speed than the current one. We are currently working on a new version of _Urantiapedia Tools_.

## :wrench: Urantiapedia Tools

We have begun development of a new version of _Urantiapedia Tools_. This software is responsible for accelerating many of our automated processes. Until now, the source code for this software was located in the project's [`app`](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia/tree/master/app) folder. That code will remain there for future reference, but version 2.0 is being developed as its own project on GitHub: [Urantiapedia Tools 2.0](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-tools). This new project is public, like everything we do at Urantiapedia, so anyone can contribute. The goal is to port all the remaining useful code, removing obsolete code, improve the maintainability of this software (by using the latest and most modern libraries), and substantially improve the translation processes to allow for a significant increase in speed when translating thousands of pages.

In parallel, we will begin developing a new version of Wikijs. This software powers the Urantiapedia website itself. It is open-source software, and we have created our own copy here: [Wikijs for Urantiapedia](https://github.com/JanHerca/wiki). We want to make many additions to this software and then offer them to the original project as contributions. The biggest challenge we face is migrating from content on Urantiapedia for three languages ​​to content for almost 30 languages. This means increasing the number of web pages tenfold. Currently, Urantiapedia has about 120,000 pages. Uploading pages is a slow process that runs in the background to avoid impacting the website's usability. We want to implement systems that accelerate these uploads so that we can host the several million pages we will need to complete Urantiapedia in all languages ​​within a few months. The new version of _Wikijs_ that we are developing is also a public project open to collaborations.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

Another month continues with unusually high figures, with nearly 30,000 users, almost all new, who only come to browse and leave the page after a few seconds, mainly from China and Singapore. We imagine that this situation will continue for a while and then decline to more normal values.
