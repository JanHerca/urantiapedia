<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> This month has been a period of rest and recovery, so there have been few changes from the previous month. We are continuing to publish the entire catalog of works from the [Urantia Association of Spain website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/) in Spanish, which will probably be available next month. 

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics 

This month, we clearly notice an increase in all the values, which marks a positive trend that we have already seen in previous months. The number of users and usage time are increasing, the bounce rate is decreasing, and in general, everything is progressively increasing. It is worth noting that a good portion of the new users we have received come through links from other websites. We believe this is thanks to the dissemination that the Urantia Foundation is doing about the project through its latest [newsletter issue](https://www.urantia.org/news/2025-07/mustard-seed-grant-project-urantiapedia). We would like to thank everyone who is publicizing this project.
