<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> Here are another month of new additions to Urantiapedia.

## :page_with_curl: The Newspaper Library

This month we have updated the publication “Light and Life”, of the Urantia Association of Spain, with the latest issues to date, in [English](/en/index/articles_luz_y_vida), [Spanish](/es/index/articles_luz_y_vida) and [French](/fr/index/articles_luz_y_vida).

## :books: The Book Library

We are generating all the books in the [Library](/en/book) that we want to have available for the ["Mustard Seed"](https://www.urantia.org/news/2023-03/mustard-seed-grants-program) project, which will conclude in April of this year. In total, about 300 books will be available. This work is currently in progress.

## :card_index: The Encyclopedia

All [Encyclopedia](/en/topic) entries beginning with the letters G, H, I, J, K, and L are now [completed](/en/index/topics) in English, Spanish, and French. We will continue with the remaining entries in the coming months. We hope to complete the first version of the Encyclopedia by April 2025.

It is important to clarify for potential readers that this is the first version of the Encyclopedia, produced by agile and rapid means, as the current number of entries is very high, at over 4,000. In the future, this Encyclopedia will be improved with revisions that will be made, but always based on the work we are doing now. We believe that this first version of the Encyclopedia, as it is being completed, already has a very high intrinsic value for readers of _The Urantia Book_.
