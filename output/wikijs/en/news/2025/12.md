<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> 2025 is drawing to a close, and it's time to take stock of everything we've accomplished this year at Urantiapedia. In March, we finalized our plan with the [Mustard Seed Grants Program](https://www.urantia.org/news/2023-03/mustard-seed-grants-program), which for two years has provided a significant boost to our content development. We already published a [detailed report](/en/news/2025/Special) on everything we accomplished during the program. Now it's time to take a look at what the year has meant as a whole. 

## :fireworks: 2025 in Retrospect 

- **GitHub** (main project) 
  * The project received 666 commits during the year. :sunglasses: 
  * It received 8,893,753 additions and 1,526,348 deletions (this refers to modified lines!). :dizzy_face: 

- :page_facing_up: **Pages** : Urantiapedia now has 102,651 pages created. We added 24,564 new pages during this year. :open_mouth: 

- :page_with_curl: **Articles** (**Newsletters Archive**): Last year we ended up publishing 5,306 articles in English, Spanish, and French. This year we have 6,124 articles in each language, almost a thousand more. :ok_hand: Check out the [Index by publications](/en/index/articles). 

- :books: **Books** (**Library**): We currently have 318 books in English, Spanish, and French. Last year we had 204 books in English, 204 in Spanish, and 192 in French. We have increased the number of books by more than a hundred. The goal remains to add a library of around 700 books. Check out the [Index of all book groups](/en/index/books). 

- :notebook: **Study aids**: We currently have 31 study aids in English, Spanish, and French. Take a look at the [Study Aids Index](/en/index/study_aids). 

- :card_index: **Encyclopedia**: The Encyclopedia currently comprises 4,496 entries in each of these three languages: English, Spanish, and French. :+1: Take a look at the [Topics Index](/en/index/topics). 

- :blue_book: **The Urantia Book**: We have added a number of improvements related to _The Urantia Book_: 
  - _The Urantia Book_ documents are now available in all languages ​​that have an official translation (28 currently). 
  - All languages ​​finally have the multi-column version available, with the original English version and the translated version.
  - In the English language, a new multiple version has been added (so now all languages ​​have one). The English multiple version shows both the current version and the original 1955 version. The current version includes some minor changes and errata corrections. 
  - In the Korean, Russian, French, and Spanish multiple versions, we have added new alternative translations. There are 4 translations available in Korean, 2 in Russian, 2 in French, and 4 in Spanish. 
  - We have corrected some special paragraphs in *The Urantia Book* that are simply paragraph separators, marked with asterisks (\* \* \*). These paragraphs are either these or are found after these: [LU 31:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_21), [LU 56:10.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_22), [LU 120:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p3_11), [LU 134:6.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p6_14), [LU 144:5.11-87](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p5_11). These paragraphs now have the same references as the official ones in the publications of the [Urantia Foundation](https://urantia.org). 
  - We have decided that section 139:9 (James and Jude, Alphaeus) does not exist, and the existing section is [LU 139:10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10) to provide a unified way to access this atypical section. 
  - We have included the authors' names in the compact index. 
  - We have included some additions in the extended index within the sections that appear in the official index. These additions were found only for English and Spanish. In the other languages, a translation was made from English. 
  - Some adjustments have been made to the typography in Korean. 

- :closed_book: **The Bible**: We have added all the extra-biblical books in Arabic. In total, the biblical and extra-biblical books in the Library number 155 and are now available in Arabic, English, Spanish, and French. 

- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **The “Jesus of Nazareth” Novel Project**: This project by Jan Herca, founder of Urantiapedia, aims to create a novel about the life of Jesus inspired by Part Four of *The Urantia Book*, and to publish it freely on Urantiapedia. Two parts are already available, and two more will be available soon. New this year, the Urantiapedia edition of this novel includes illustrations. Check out the [cover page](/es/book/Jan_Herca/Jesus_of_Nazareth). The novel is currently only available in Spanish. 

- **Urantiapedia Help**: We have significantly improved some parts of the [Urantiapedia Help](/en/help) and translated it into three more languages. It is now available in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, and Korean. 

## Future Plan

At Urantiapedia, we've reached such a large number of web pages that we're nearing the limits of how quickly we can continue to increase content. We estimate that for any given language, once the content is as complete as possible, it will amount to approximately 25,000 pages. The total content for the 28 current languages ​​would result in a website of 700,000 pages. The software we're currently using isn't designed to handle that much content. 

Furthermore, translating content into other languages ​​is proving very costly in terms of both time and money. Even using paid tools, the translation results aren't always as expected because there are formatting marks alongside the text that shouldn't be modified. This means that after translation, a review process is necessary, which slows down the overall process. 

Our future priority will be to eliminate these critical bottlenecks. 

To this end, we've started two parallel development projects. One is a new version 2.0 of [Urantiapedia Tools](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-tools), and the other is a new version of [Wiki.js](https://github.com/JanHerca/wiki). Our goal with these developments is to eliminate the two main limitations we currently face in scaling the project from the current 100,000 pages to the future 700,000: 
1. The new version of Urantiapedia Tools is developed using the same modern technologies as Wiki.js. We want to develop an AI-based system that will allow us to translate hundreds of thousands of pages with virtually no errors, without the need for subsequent revisions, and at minimal cost. 
2. The new version of Wiki.js will accelerate the uploading of massive amounts of data so that creating thousands of pages takes minutes instead of hours. 

The content will continue to grow in the coming months, but the two tasks mentioned above will take priority during 2026. 

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

What seemed like it would be a few months of unusual data caused by a massive influx of users from China and Singapore is becoming the norm. All metrics indicating engagement have plummeted to record lows. For example, the average engagement time is now below one minute, indicating that many users are simply logging in, skimming a page briefly, and then leaving. That's why we've also included the engagement time of returning users in the statistics, because it's clear that loyal users who tend to come back spend an average of about 4 minutes on the site, indicating a longer engagement. Therefore, the more than 40,000 new users we've registered in the last month isn't necessarily good news. There's a lot of interest in visiting the website, but then we clearly see that this initial interest isn't translating into longer engagement with the content. Let's hope 2026 is a good year, that this situation normalizes, and that the website's actual users find content that interests them for longer periods. We'll be working on it.
