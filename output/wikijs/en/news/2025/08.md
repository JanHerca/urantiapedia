<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> This month hasn't been very productive compared to others. We took a break for vacation and also, unfortunately, we had to pause for a few days due to health issues :mask:, although they were eventually resolved without any serious problems. In any case, at Urantiapedia we don't give up and we've been able to continue adding a good number of new things. :+1:

## New Languages

​​Urantiapedia is now available in [Chinese](/zh/home) and [Arabic](/ar/home)! :tada: :tada: That's great news. :clap: :clap: This brings the number of supported languages ​​to 27! For now, we've only added the main pages, but we're planning to make Chinese, Arabic, Korean, and Portuguese the next languages ​​to receive full content alongside the existing ones for English, Spanish, and French. This will take many months, but we'll be working towards this goal little by little.

## :blue_book: The Urantia Book

We're starting to add _The Urantia Book_ in [Chinese](/zh/The_Urantia_Book/1) and [Arabic](/ar/The_Urantia_Book/1). We have downloaded and processed the originals available on the [Urantia Foundation](https://www.urantia.org) website, and they will probably be fully uploaded sometime next month, along with their indexes and the dual English version.

## :closed_book: The Bible

The _Bible_ is currently being uploaded in Chinese and Arabic. Each chapter of the _Bible_ is a page on Urantiapedia, so we are talking about hundreds and hundreds of pages that will take a few more days to be available, and will probably be completed sometime next month.

It should be noted that when uploading Bibles to Urantiapedia, we must use public domain versions and not modern versions. This is why the editions we have available may seem a bit strange to many readers who are not used to older versions. In any case, we always try to use the most modern versions possible. In the case of Chinese, we used the [Simplified Chinese Union Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Union_Version), published in 1919; in the case of Arabic, we used the one published in 1865 by Eli Smith and Cornelius Van Alen Van Dyck. Curiously, [multiple translations of the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations_into_Arabic) in Arabic have existed for many centuries. The chosen translation is one of the most widely used before the more modern revisions.

Along with the addition of the _Bible_, we have also completed a translation of the [Paramony](https://urantia-book.org/urantiabook/paramony/) into Chinese and Arabic. As we have explained on other occasions, the Paramony is the work of Duane Faw, a reader of _The Urantia Book_, in which he compiled thousands of cross-references between the book and the _Bible_. We are adding these references as footnotes to each paper so that any reader can easily move between paragraphs in the book and equivalent verses in the Bible. The Paramony in the form of notes is being uploaded at this time and will also be available next month.

## :page_with_curl: The Newspaper Archive

In the [Newspaper Archive](/en/index/articles) we have added a new group, [Articles from the Fellowship of The Urantia Book](/en/index/articles_fellowship). Here we will be adding many resources and articles that are available from the [_Urantia Book_ Fellowship website](https://www.urantiabook.org/). So far, about 40 articles by Rev. Meredith Sprunger have been uploaded in [English](/en/index/articles_fellowship), [Spanish](/es/index/articles_fellowship), and [French](/fr/index/articles_fellowship). In the coming months, we will be expanding this collection with writings and works from many other authors available on this website, one of the reference websites related to _The Urantia Book_, and surely the site that offers the most help and resources for readers.

## :books: The Library

We have added several new books to the [Library](/en/index/books):
- In the section of religious books on Sikhism, the second volume of the collection “The Sikh Religion” has been added. The first volume was available and now the second one is available in [English](/en/book/Sikhism/The_Sikh_Religion_Volume_2), [Spanish](/es/book/Sikhism/The_Sikh_Religion_Volume_2) and [French](/fr/book/Sikhism/The_Sikh_Religion_Volume_2).
- In the Philosophy books section, we have added “_Prescription for Permanent Peace_” by William S. Sadler, in [English](/en/book/William_S_Sadler/Prescription_for_Permanent_Peace), [Spanish](/es/book/William_S_Sadler/Prescription_for_Permanent_Peace) and [French](/fr/book/William_S_Sadler/Prescription_for_Permanent_Peace).
- In the Theology books section (subsection «Jesus Studies») the following has been added: “_The Real Jesus: What He Taught, What He Did, Who He Was_”, by Charles Fiske and Burton Scott Easton, in [English](/en/book/Charles_Fiske_And_Burton_Scott_Easton/The_Real_Jesus), [Spanish](/es/book/Charles_Fiske_And_Burton_Scott_Easton/The_Real_Jesus) and [French](/fr/book/Charles_Fiske_And_Burton_Scott_Easton/The_Real_Jesus). In this same section, “_Our Lord's Earthly Life_” by David Smith has been added in [English](/en/book/David_Smith/Our_Lords_Earthly_Life), [Spanish](/es/book/David_Smith/Our_Lords_Earthly_Life) and [French](/fr/book/David_Smith/Our_Lords_Earthly_Life).
- In the readers' books section, in the collection of novels titled ["Jesus of Nazareth"](/es/book/Jan_Herca/Jesus_of_Nazareth), by Jan Herca, [volume 6 of this collection in Spanish](/es/book/Jan_Herca/Jesus_of_Nazareth_Vol_06) has been added. This volume is one that has been published for many years on other platforms. It is now finally available on Urantiapedia, in web format and with the novelty of being illustrated. The illustrations have been generated using Google's AI. More volumes will be added in the coming months, both in their original Spanish and in the form of translations.

## :grey_question: Urantiapedia Help

Some sections of the documentation have been corrected to better reflect the [processes](/en/help/github_paramony) necessary to add translations of The Urantia Book as well as the Bible and the Paramony.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

This month has undoubtedly had the highest number of visits we have ever recorded! :clap: :clap: That's almost an 80% jump compared to previous months. So far, the maximum we've had has been around 4,000 monthly users, and this month we've surpassed 7,000. Many of these users are from Latin American countries, especially Mexico, where the number of users has been extremely high, even surpassing that of the United States. We're pleased to see that the page continues to grow in interest little by little, and that encourages us much to continue and not stop offering new content in the future. :+1:
