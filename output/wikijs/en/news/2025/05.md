<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Once again, here are the news from the last month on _Urantiapedia_. After the completion of the [Mustard Seed project](https://www.urantia.org/about-us/what-we-do/mustard-seed-grants-program), to which we dedicated a [special report last month](/en/news/2025/Special), this month has been a quieter one :relieved: where we have resumed work on content that we didn't have time to add in previous months.

## :page_with_curl: The Newspaper Archive

As for the [Newspaper Archive](/en/article), the content added this month is:

- Update of the [Urantia Foundation News Online](/en/index/articles_uf_news_online) with the latest published issues (in English, Spanish, and French). The Foundation also publishes this magazine in other languages, but for now, _Urantiapedia_ will continue to focus on the three languages ​​indicated due to our limitations.
- Update of the Spanish magazine [Luz y Vida](/en/index/articles_luz_y_vida) with the latest published issues (in English, Spanish, and French).
- Start of publication in Spanish of the [articles and works](/en/index/articles_spain) available on the [Urantia Association of Spain website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/). This website has approximately 170 papers, organized according to the parts of _The Urantia Book_. Some are very extensive and detailed works; others are Spanish translations of other articles from different publications, but together they comprise very interesting content. For now, we have excluded from _Urantiapedia_ works that are presentations or diagrams; these will be the subject of future work. In the coming months, we will continue to expand this section of the Newspaper Archive until all the works are included. For now, only articles related to Parts I and II of _The Urantia Book_ have been included, and in Spanish.
- Additions of more [articles and works by Jan Herca](/en/index/articles_jan_herca), related to the time of Jesus.

The Newspaper Library is going to be one of the areas of _Urantiapedia_ we'll be focusing on the most in the coming months. We'll be updating all the publications with the latest available issues; we'll be expanding publications with older issues that have yet to be uploaded; and on the other hand, there are a few publications and websites with a large amount of content that we haven't yet uploaded to _Urantiapedia_ and that we don't want to delay bringing here. Stay tuned for this area because there will be many interesting additions. :tada: :mega:

## :books: The Library

This month, the book [“Men of the Old Stone Age”](/en/book/Henry_Fairfield_Osborn/Men_of_the_Old_Stone_Age) by Henry Fairfield Osborn has been uploaded, a possible work used by the revelators to provide us with their information related to prehistoric archaeology. This is an extensive work, with a multitude of illustrations, whose conversion to an online book has taken considerable time and effort. In the future, our intention is to include the works of Matthew Block that allow us to relate these books to _The Urantia Book_, which we believe will allow for a better understanding of the revelatory process and the affirmations contained in the book. :flashlight:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

This past month, very clear and important changes have been noted in all the statistics, for the better. Sessions and the number of users have increased significantly, by 20% or more. The average interaction time has remained very constant, and the number of users who have returned to the page has also increased significantly.

Perhaps the explanation for this spectacular increase in the use of _Urantiapedia_ is due to the significant access from countries like Singapore and Hong Kong. This is also evident in the changes in the way users access the site, as many users now access it from a Macintosh PC. These new users are accessing the site in English (Chinese is not yet available on _Urantiapedia_ but will be soon), which explains the shift in English, which has once again become the most used language on _Urantiapedia_, ahead of Spanish. Also worth noting is the significant increase in users from Mexico, which now leads the Spanish-speaking world in accessing the site.

All of these indicators are very good news and encourage us to continue working hard to offer much more content in the coming months and years, especially in more languages.
