<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Urantiapedia is close to completing a set of three major milestones - the first, as complete as possible, release of the [Newspaper Library](/en/article), the [Library](/en/book), and the [Encyclopedia](/en/topic) - and we are moving full speed ahead to make this happen sometime this March. :heart_eyes: :fireworks: :tada: 

Here is a summary of the work done in February. 

## :page_with_curl: The Newspaper Library 

We have made numerous corrections here and there to articles in various publications, mostly corrections to formatting. The changes have been made in the three languages ​​we are currently focusing on: English, Spanish, and French. 

## :books: The Library 

We are going through the process of uploading the books to the Library in stages. First we create the structure of the books (which has already been completed in English, Spanish, and French), then we convert the texts to the Urantiapedia format (which is usually Markdown with certain extensions), and finally we add the content to the structure of the books. The first books we upload are in English, then we translate them into Spanish, and finally into French. 

We estimate that all the books we want to upload to the Library for this current phase of Urantiapedia will be available by the end of this March. 

## :card_index: The Encyclopedia 

All but 80 of the 4,400+ entries that make up the Encyclopedia have been reviewed (in English, Spanish, and French) and will be uploaded in the coming weeks. During March we will finish reviewing the remaining 80 entries, which are some of the longest and most meaningful. We want these entries to be as fine-tuned as possible and will be spending extra time on them. 

It is safe to say that the first major version of _The Urantia Book_ Encyclopedia is just days away from completion.
