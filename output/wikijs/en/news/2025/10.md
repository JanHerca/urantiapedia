<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Another month has passed, and here we are with all the new features we've added to Urantiapedia.

## :blue_book: The Urantia Book

We are in the process of updating _The Urantia Book_ in all languages, correcting some errors we had, as well as improving the number of translations:
- Some languages ​​did not have all the papers from _The Urantia Book_.
- In some cases we did not have the multi-column version generated with the original English version and the translated version.
- In some languages ​​there are more translations that we would like to incorporate, such as Korean, Russian, French, Spanish and Croatian.
- There are some special paragraphs in _The Urantia Book_ that are simply separators between paragraphs, marked with asterisks (\* \* \*). These paragraphs are the following or are after the following: [UB 31:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_21), [UB 56:10.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_22), [UB 120:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p3_11), [UB 134:6.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p6_14), [UB 144:5.11-87](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p5_11). We are correcting these paragraphs to have the same references as the official ones in the publications of the [Urantia Foundation](https://urantia.org).
- We have decided that section 139:9 (James and Jude Alphaeus) does not exist and the one that exists is [UB 139:10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10) in order to leave a unified way of accessing that atypical section.
- The compact index should include the names of the authors of the documents.
- The extended index must include some entries within the sections that appear in the official index.

All this work is underway for all languages ​​and we will continue with it during the next month.

## :books: The Library

We have added several new books to the [Library](/en/index/books):
- The Zoroastrian religious books section is now complete with all the books we planned to upload, in [English](/en/book/Zoroastrianism), [Spanish](/es/book/Zoroastrianism) and [French](/fr/book/Zoroastrianism). In total, we have 10 books containing the most representative literature of this religion.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

Although we've had unusually high visitor numbers this month, with nearly 30,000 users, these high figures are due to a massive influx of visitors in the last week from China and Singapore. These users visited briefly, browsed for a few seconds, and quickly left. At the beginning of the new month, this unusual trend is disappearing and returning to normal levels. This behavior is not due to any Urantiapedia advertising campaign but is likely due to recent interest in China and Singapore in the new Chinese content we are adding to Urantiapedia. User numbers have therefore increased significantly, but interaction times have dropped to a minimum. We expect that the Chinese content we will be uploading in the coming months will further increase the interest of all these users.
