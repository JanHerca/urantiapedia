<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="News" style="width: 80px;"> Urantiapedia has finally completed two of the major milestones on its roadmap! :fireworks: :tada: :muscle: :deciduous_tree: [Phase II](/en/help/phases#milestone-ii-newspaper-library-urantia-library-and-encyclopedia) and [Phase III](/en/help/phases#milestone-iii-translator) can now be considered complete! :clap: :clap: From now on, a new chapter opens for this project. New goals are undoubtedly already being set on the horizon, but now is the time to review what we have uploaded during the last month of March and show in a general way what the status of the project is.

## :page_with_curl: The Newspaper Library

We have corrected some minor errors in the content that was already in the [Newspaper Library](/en/article), but little progress has been made in this section to focus on the other two major items in these phases.

The Newspaper Library finally contains a good number of issues from about 20 publications, as well as a set of more than 40 study aids.

We are still far from having compiled all the issues of all the existing publications related to _The Urantia Book_. But without a doubt, the current amount of content is more than enough to help readers of the book form an idea of ​​the inquiries and investigations that other readers have made over the last 50 years. And of course, much more content will come in the future.

The catalog of publications from the Newspaper Library can be consulted here: [Magazines](/en/index/articles) and [Study Aids](/en/index/study_aids). It can also be found through the side menu of the website.

## :books: The Library

Finally, the total number of books that have been added to the [Library](/en/book) amounts to 280 titles. :astonished: :+1: The collection consists of all the biblical books, extra-biblical and apocryphal books, books from all the world's major religions, books supposedly used by the revelators, and a few books from the readers. All titles were originally in English and are now also available in Spanish and French.

The initial catalog we had proposed includes almost 700 books, so we are still far from all the titles we want to offer on Urantiapedia. The work of converting these books has been much more laborious than expected, even with books that are in some digital format. :sweat: Therefore, we will continue to upload more and more books in the new phase that begins in the project. Furthermore, the most important task we intended, which was to connect the Library with the rest of the content using links, has only been partially completed, especially for biblical books, but only slightly for the rest of the books. This will also be one of the major goals we set for ourselves in the new phase we are entering.

It is also worth clarifying that the books are translated into thousands of new pages on the website, one for each chapter of each book. This is putting the Urantiapedia server at the limit of what it can upload each day. And for this reason, some French books will only be available during the first half of April. They are all being uploaded, but it will take a few days for them to appear as available.

The catalog of all the bookshelves that make up this Library can be consulted here: [Library](/en/index/books) or by using the site's side menu.

## :card_index: The Encyclopedia

Finally, the more than 4,400 entries that make up the [Encyclopedia](/en/topic) are available in English, Spanish, and French, as well as the links that connect in both directions with _The Urantia Book_.

This work has undoubtedly been the most arduous of all by far. :construction_worker: In the _Newspaper Library_ or the _Library_, we have acted as simple compilers of content that was often even in a web format. In the case of the _Encyclopedia_, it is 100% original work. We based ourselves on the Fellowship's [Topic Index](https://urantia-book.org/urantiabook/topical_index/index.htm), but this work, although immense, only contained small indicative texts and was not properly a catalog of thematic content.

Of course, the _Encyclopedia_ that has been generated is not free of errors or things that could be improved: the texts may not follow a very correct order at times; the links are sometimes excessive and link to things of little interest; we have no illustrations; there are no links to other parts of _Urantiapedia_ other than _The Urantia Book_. We warned about all of these things in advance, but even so, this _Encyclopedia of The Urantia Book_ is **the first ever created**. :dizzy_face: And it's just the starting point for a product that we hope will continue to improve over time. And it's also in three languages, something that has taken many hours of work!

In any case, we are confident that this first version of the _Urantia Book Encyclopedia_ will be extremely useful to students and inquirers seeking to delve deeper into the revelations. Happy searching, everyone!

The general index of the Encyclopedia can be consulted here: [Encyclopedia](/en/index/topics).

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics

The number of users has not changed significantly this month and remains very constant. Perhaps a couple of details are noteworthy. On the one hand, the Spanish language is rising spectacularly on _Urantiapedia_. Spanish-speaking users now represent half of all those who access the page. Secondly, it is surprising that we have more visitors from South Korea and Turkey than from other countries where translations of _The Urantia Book_ have been available for some time, as is the case in many European countries. A symptom that much is turning around in the world, and that is also reflected in our statistics.
