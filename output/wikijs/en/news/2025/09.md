<img src="/_assets/svg/icon-news.svg" alt="Novedades" style="width: 80px;"> Another month later, we're back with all the new features we've added to Urantiapedia. 

## New Languages 

​​Urantiapedia's help and news pages are now available in [Chinese](/zh/help), [Arabic](/ar/help), and [Korean](/ko/help). :tada: This brings the number of languages ​​available for these pages to 7. In the coming months, we will continue to expand the content in these languages ​​with the goal of bringing them all into equal standing. 

## :blue_book: The Urantia Book 

_The Urantia Book_ is now available in [Chinese](/zh/The_Urantia_Book/1) and [Arabic](/ar/The_Urantia_Book/1) in both single and dual versions with English, and with cross-references to the Bible in the footnotes. 

## :closed_book: The Bible

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Statistics 

We repeat another month with a record number of visits, surpassing 8,000 users in a single month! :clap: :clap: Without a doubt, this new leap is due to a spectacular increase in the number of visits from users in China, with more than a third of all visits recorded this last month, the country with the most visits we have ever had. :+1: This encourages us to continue expanding the content to the new languages ​​we want to reach, such as Chinese, Arabic, Korean and Portuguese. It will be a long job but we are sure it will be very well received. We will work on it.
