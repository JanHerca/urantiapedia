<p>Judas never acquired a philosophic technique for meeting disappointment. Instead of accepting disappointments as a regular and commonplace feature of human existence, he unfailingly resorted to the practice of blaming someone in particular, or his associates as a group, for all his personal difficulties and disappointments. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> How prone is man, when he is confronted with the failures of his own making, to put the blame upon others, oftentimes upon those who least deserve it! <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jesus asked to refrain from condemnation: will you call upon the Lord, and he shall answer; you will cry out, and he shall say—Here am I. And all this he will do if you refrain from oppression, condemnation, and vanity. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
