<p>The wearing of the bridal veil is a relic of the times when it was considered necessary to disguise the bride so that ghosts might not recognize her and also to hide her <a href="/topic/beauty">beauty</a> from the gaze of the otherwise jealous and envious spirits. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> The carrying of the bride over the threshold is reminiscent of a number of ancient practices, among others, of the days of wife stealing. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Bridal shows </h2>
<p>The bride shows were occasions for dressing up and decorating daughters for public exhibition with the idea of their bringing higher prices as wives. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many tribes sanctioned the formation of women’s secret clubs to prepare adolescent girls for wifehood and motherhood. After initiation girls were eligible for marriage and were permitted to attend the “bride show,” the coming-out party of those days. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
