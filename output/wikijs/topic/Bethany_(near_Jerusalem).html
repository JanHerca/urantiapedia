<p>Bethany was about two miles from the temple of Jerusalem. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jesus met Mary, Martha, and Lazarus of Bethany when he and his parents happened to stop near the three brothers' home on their first trip to Jerusalem in April of the year 7. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Lazarus and his sisters were the children of Simon, a well-to-do and honorable Jew, one who had been the leading resident of the little village of Bethany. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Almost every person from Bethany became believer in Jesus. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> Jesus appeared in Bethany to his brother James, his third appearance, and then to twenty people including family and friends, his fourth appearance. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
