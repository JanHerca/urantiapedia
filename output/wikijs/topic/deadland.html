<p>It was once thought that the great desire of a ghost was to be quickly “laid” so that it might proceed undisturbed to deadland. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Fasting and other forms of self-denial were thought to be pleasing to the ghosts, who took pleasure in the discomfort of the living during the transition period of lurking about before their actual departure for deadland. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
