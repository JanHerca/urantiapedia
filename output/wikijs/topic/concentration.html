<p>Jesus teach: The heathen are not without excuse when they rage at us. Because their outlook is small and narrow, they are able to concentrate their energies enthusiastically. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jesus possessed the ability effectively to mobilize all his powers of mind, soul, and body on the task immediately in hand. He could concentrate his deep-thinking mind on the one problem which he wished to solve, and this, in connection with his untiring patience, enabled him serenely to endure the trials. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
