<p>Our ensembles of dancing undoubtedly represent a crude and grotesque attempt of material creatures to approach the celestial harmony of being placement and personality arrangement. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Wild dancing can induce a mystic state. But instead of mystical experiences the more healthful attitude of spiritual meditation is to be found in reflective worship and in the prayer of thanksgiving. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Among primitive man </h2>
<p>Dance originated in seasonal worship festivals. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Initially prayers were acted out; magical dances were nothing but dramatic prayers. Religion was danced out rather than thought out. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> Many shamanesses were professional dancers. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> The purely military war dances were refined and made to serve valuable social ends by Planetary Prince’s staff. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Society, today, enjoys the benefit of a long list of useful innovations which were at first wholly military and is even indebted to war for the dance, one of the early forms of which was a military drill. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
