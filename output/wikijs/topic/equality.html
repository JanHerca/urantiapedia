<p>The belief that all men are born equal is an erroneous belief, the same as it was an <a href="/topic/error">error</a> in <a href="/topic/Europe">European</a> Middle Ages that every man belonged to someone else. Human beings may differ greatly in innate abilities and intellectual endowment. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> But in spirit all men are equal. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The weak and the inferior have always contended for equal rights; they have always insisted that the state compel the strong and superior to supply their wants and otherwise make good those deficiencies which all too often are the natural result of their own indifference and indolence. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> The concept of equality never brings peace except in the mutual recognition of some overcontrolling influence of supersovereignty. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Self-assertion was the battle cry of the Lucifer rebellion. One of his chief arguments was that, if self-government was good and right for the Melchizedeks and other groups, it was equally good for all orders of intelligence. He was bold and persistent in the advocacy of the “equality of mind” and “the brotherhood of intelligence.”. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Jesus and equality of men and women </h2>
<p>Jesus was deeply angered by the difference in his time in the religious <a href="/topic/education">education</a> of men and women. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The most astonishing and the most revolutionary feature of Michael’s mission on <a href="/topic/earth">earth</a> was his attitude toward women. In one generation Jesus lifted women out of the disrespectful oblivion and the slavish drudgery of the ages. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The apostles were at first shocked by, but early became accustomed to, Jesus’ treatment of women; he made it very clear to them that women were to be accorded equal rights with men in the kingdom. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Notwithstanding apostles had many times heard the Master say that “in the kingdom of heaven there is neither rich nor poor, free nor bond, male nor female, all are equally the sons and daughters of God,” they were literally stunned when he proposed formally to commission these ten women as religious teachers and even to permit their traveling about with them. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While Jesus refused to make pronouncements dealing with marriage and divorce, he did most bitterly denounce the shameful floutings of the marriage relationship and pointed out their injustice to women and children. He never sanctioned any divorce practice which gave man any advantage over woman; the Master countenanced only those teachings which accorded women equality with men. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Woman’s status in Palestine was much improved by Jesus’ teaching. After Pentecost, in the brotherhood of the kingdom woman stood before God on an equality with man. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> </p>
