<p>Throughout all organized space there are gravity-responding <a href="/topic/energy">energy</a> currents, power circuits, and ultimatonic activities, as well as organizing electronic energies. Practically speaking, space is not empty. Emptiest space has 100 ultimatons per cubic inch. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Emptiness does have its virtue, for it may become experientially filled. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
