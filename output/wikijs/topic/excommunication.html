<p>Not only Jesus was denied entrance into all synagogues, but that all who believed in his teaching were likewise cast out of the synagogue, excommunicated from the congregation of Israel; and this meant denial of all rights and privileges of every sort throughout all Jewry except the right to buy the necessaries of life. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Josiah the blind was casted out of the synagogue. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Caiaphas called a meeting of the Sanhedrin to convene that action was taken to throw out of the synagogues any person who made mention of Jesus’ resurrection. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Cleopas, the elder brother of <a href="/topic/Emmaus">Emmaus</a> disciples, had been casted out of the synagogue. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
