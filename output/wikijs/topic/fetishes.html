<p>Belief in relics is an outgrowth of the ancient fetish cult. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Confucius made a new fetish out of order and established a respect for ancestral conduct that is still venerated by the Chinese at present day. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> The doctrine of spirit possession is nothing more nor less than fetishism. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> To protect them water holes, wells, trees, crops, and honey were considered fetishes. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Fetishism ran through all the primitive cults from the earliest belief in sacred stones, through idolatry, cannibalism, and nature worship, to totemism. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> Fetishes made early market places secure against theft. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> Fetishes were many times mere symbols of the real object of worship. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> The technique of religious ritual passed from the <a href="/topic/forms">forms</a> of the primitive cult through fetishes to magic and miracles. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A fetish bag, a medicine bag, was a pouch containing a reputable assortment of ghost-impregnated articles, and the medicine man of old never allowed his bag, the symbol of his power, to touch the ground. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> When plants and fruits became fetishes, they were taboo as <a href="/topic/food">food</a>. Apple was a fetish <a href="/topic/fruit">fruit</a>. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When animals became fetishes, there ensued the taboos on eating the <a href="/topic/flesh">flesh</a> of the fetish animal. Fetish animals were dogs, apes, monkeys, snakes, birds, pigs and cows. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Examples </h2>
<p>The <a href="/topic/first">first</a> fetishes were peculiarly marked pebbles, and “sacred stones” have ever since been sought by man. Certain days of the week were fetishes. Also the lucky numbers. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Saliva was a potent fetish. Parts of the human body were looked upon as potential fetishes, particularly the hair and nails. Hunchbacked and crippled children were regarded as fetishes; lunatics were believed to be moon-struck. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There was only one factor of a tribal, racial, or national nature about the primitive and unorganized beliefs of the desert, and that was the peculiar and general respect which almost all Arabian tribes were willing to pay to a certain black stone fetish in a certain temple at Mecca. <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> Kings became fetish personalities and were inordinately feared, a special form of speech being adopted for court usage. <sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup> </p>
