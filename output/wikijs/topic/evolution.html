<h2> Biologic evolution </h2>
<p>The Urantia midwayers have assembled over 50,000 facts of physics and chemistry which prove that evolution is not accidental. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Physics and chemistry alone cannot explain how a human being evolved out of the primeval seaweed. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Biologic evolution and cultural civilization are not necessarily correlated; organic evolution in any age may proceed unhindered in the very midst of cultural decadence. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Missing links never existed between the great divisions of the animal kingdom nor between the highest of the prehuman animal types and the dawn men of the human races. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sin, Caligastia rebellion, Adam’s default, did very little to delay biologic evolution, but it did operate to deprive the mortal races of the full benefit of the Adamic inheritance. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> Jesus did not interfere with the normal and orderly progressive evolution of the Urantia races. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> There is no organic evolution on Jerusem, there are no conflicting forms of life, no struggle for existence, no survival of the fittest. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Sponsors </h3>
<p>It is the integrated functioning of the Life Carriers, the physical controllers, and the spirit adjutants that conditions the course of organic evolution on the inhabited worlds. And this is why evolution—on Urantia or elsewhere—is always purposeful and never accidental. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Under the supervision of the Melchizedek receivers, Van and Amadon continued the work of fostering the natural evolution of the human race, carrying forward the physical evolution of man until it reached that culminating attainment which warranted the dispatch of a Material Son and Daughter to Urantia. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Plant evolution </h3>
<p>In the development of planetary life the vegetable form always precedes the animal and is quite fully developed before the animal patterns differentiate. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> Inland seas were cradle of evolution. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> Man’s primordial ancestors were literally the slime and ooze of the ocean bed. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> Sponge-like organisms are the early intermediate types through which the gradual transition from plant to animal occurred. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> While some new species are progressing, certain strains remain stationary and others gravitate backward, reverting to a former state. <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> Bacteria and fungi are a retrograde movement in plant evolution. <sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup> Amoebas and protozoa are a retrograde movement in animal evolution. <sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup> Most important steps regarding plants were chlorophyll-making and seeds. <sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Animal evolution </h3>
<p>Before long the early single-celled animal types associated themselves in communities, first on the plan of the Volvox and presently along the lines of the Hydra and jellyfish. Still later there evolved the starfish, stone lilies, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, centipedes, insects, spiders, crustaceans, and the closely related groups of <a href="/topic/earthworms">earthworms</a> and leeches, soon followed by the mollusks. <sup id="cite18"><a href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The stage was thus set for the appearance of the first backboned animals, the fishes. The frog is one of the earliest of surviving human-race ancestors. <sup id="cite19"><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The frogs gave rise to the Reptilia, a great animal family which is virtually extinct, but which, before passing out of existence, gave origin to the whole bird family and the numerous orders of mammals. Probably the greatest single leap of all prehuman evolution was executed when the reptile became a bird. <sup id="cite20"><a href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>First herbivorous dinosaurs developed a protective armor. As times passed  brains and agility had replaced armor and size in the progress of animal survival. <sup id="cite21"><a href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup> Mice reproduce much more rapidly than <a href="/topic/elephants">elephants</a>, yet elephants evolve more rapidly than mice. <sup id="cite22"><a href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Human evolution </h3>
<p>We can hardly realize by what narrow margins our prehuman ancestors missed <a href="/topic/extinction">extinction</a> from time to time. <sup id="cite23"><a href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup> The two unique features on Urantia were appearance of Andonic race prior to colored peoples and appearance in a single family of six colored races. <sup id="cite24"><a href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In Urantia it was intended to produce an early manifestation of will in the evolutionary life, and it was a success. Ordinarily, will does not emerge until the colored races have long been in existence, usually first appearing among the superior types of the red man. Urantia is the only planet in Satania where the human type of will has appeared in a precolored race. <sup id="cite25"><a href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Adam’s contribution to the biologic status of the races, notwithstanding the partial failure of the undertaking, enormously upstepped the people of Urantia. <sup id="cite26"><a href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Long before the Material Son and Daughter, the biologic uplifters, arrive on a planet, the human potentials of the evolving animal species have been exhausted. <sup id="cite27"><a href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Now the human species is slowly gravitating toward twenty-eight. The process of evolution is still actively and adaptatively in progress on this planet. <sup id="cite28"><a href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Life Carriers </h3>
<p>Evolution is limited by potentials of original Life Carrier implantations. <sup id="cite29"><a href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During the ages intervening between life establishment and the emergence of human creatures of moral status, the Life Carriers are permitted to manipulate the life <a href="/topic/environment">environment</a> and otherwise favorably directionize the course of biologic evolution. <sup id="cite30"><a href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup> They are not allowed arbitrarily to interfere with life patterns once set in operation. <sup id="cite31"><a href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Theory of biologic evolution </h3>
<p>The original life plasm of an evolutionary world must contain the full potential for all future developmental variations and for all subsequent evolutionary changes and modifications. The provision for such far-reaching projects of life metamorphosis may require the appearance of many apparently useless forms of animal and vegetable life. <sup id="cite32"><a href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup> The appearance of primitive man on <a href="/topic/earth">earth</a> during the ice age was not just an accident; it was by design to produce a hardy type of human. <sup id="cite33"><a href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup> Evolution can be delayed but it cannot be stopped. <sup id="cite34"><a href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup> Evolution also cannot be accelerated beyond what planet permits. <sup id="cite35"><a href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It is the presence of the seven adjutant mind-spirits on the primitive worlds that conditions the course of organic evolution; that explains why evolution is purposeful and not accidental. <sup id="cite36"><a href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup> In some evolutive periods it is eliminated all life without survival value. <sup id="cite37"><a href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The whole principle of biologic evolution makes it impossible for primitive man to appear on the inhabited worlds with any large endowment of self-restraint. <sup id="cite38"><a href="#fn38">[38]</a></sup> Individuals lacking parental instinct eliminate themselves from reproductive stream. <sup id="cite39"><a href="#fn39">[39]</a></sup> Material Sons are dispatched when human biologic evolution attains highest level. <sup id="cite40"><a href="#fn40">[40]</a></sup> Only organisms attaining cosmic unity persist. <sup id="cite41"><a href="#fn41">[41]</a></sup> Organisms accommodate themselves to never-ending fluctuations. <sup id="cite42"><a href="#fn42">[42]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Evolution is subject to sudden changes. From era to era radically new species of animal life arise. The sudden appearance of new species and diversified orders of living organisms is wholly biologic, strictly natural. There is nothing supernatural connected with these genetic mutations. Sudden appearances have been: <sup id="cite43"><a href="#fn43">[43]</a></sup> </p>
<ol>
<li>The ameba. <sup id="cite44"><a href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup> </li>
<li>First multicellular animals. <sup id="cite45"><a href="#fn45">[45]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Trilobites and scorpions. <sup id="cite46"><a href="#fn46">[46]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Fishes and ferns. <sup id="cite47"><a href="#fn47">[47]</a></sup> </li>
<li>First amphibians and frogs. <sup id="cite48"><a href="#fn48">[48]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Reptiles. <sup id="cite49"><a href="#fn49">[49]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Land plants, flowering plants and birds. <sup id="cite50"><a href="#fn50">[50]</a></sup> </li>
<li>First mammal. <sup id="cite51"><a href="#fn51">[51]</a></sup> </li>
<li>First hoofed mammal. <sup id="cite52"><a href="#fn52">[52]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Human dawn mammals, mid-mammals, Primates and humans. <sup id="cite53"><a href="#fn53">[53]</a></sup> </li>
<li>The six colored races. <sup id="cite54"><a href="#fn54">[54]</a></sup> </li>
</ol>
<p>Early evolution is characterized by the survival of the biologically fit. <sup id="cite55"><a href="#fn55">[55]</a></sup> Variety is indispensable to opportunity for the wide functioning of natural selection, differential survival of superior strains. <sup id="cite56"><a href="#fn56">[56]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Principle of evolution </h2>
<p>Evolution—on Urantia or elsewhere—is always purposeful and never accidental. <sup id="cite57"><a href="#fn57">[57]</a></sup> Continuing evolution modifies nature by augmenting the content of Paradise perfection. <sup id="cite58"><a href="#fn58">[58]</a></sup> The final fruits of all finite growth are power controlled through mind by spirit by virtue of the unifying and creative presence of personality. <sup id="cite59"><a href="#fn59">[59]</a></sup> Evolution is the cosmic complement to perfection. <sup id="cite60"><a href="#fn60">[60]</a></sup> Evolution is a cosmic technique of growth. <sup id="cite61"><a href="#fn61">[61]</a></sup> Evolution imbues man with fear to the unknown and then obliterates that scaffolding stages. <sup id="cite62"><a href="#fn62">[62]</a></sup> All space bodies have had an evolutionary origin, evolutionary in the sense that they have not been brought into being by fiat of Deity. <sup id="cite63"><a href="#fn63">[63]</a></sup> Creators could have, but did not, choose to make local universes perfect. <sup id="cite64"><a href="#fn64">[64]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Personality, both human and superhuman, is characterized by an inherent cosmic quality which may be called “the evolution of dominance,” the expansion of the control of both itself and its <a href="/topic/environment">environment</a>. <sup id="cite65"><a href="#fn65">[65]</a></sup> The evolutionary capacity of the universe is inexhaustible in the infinity of spontaneity. <sup id="cite66"><a href="#fn66">[66]</a></sup> God does not transform animal creatures into perfected spirits by creative magic. <sup id="cite67"><a href="#fn67">[67]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The creative plan of the Paradise Michaels always proceeds along the path of gradual evolvement and progressive development of the physical, intellectual, and spiritual natures. <sup id="cite68"><a href="#fn68">[68]</a></sup> Progressive evolution indicates the dominance of the Supreme Mind. <sup id="cite69"><a href="#fn69">[69]</a></sup> Mindless causation cannot evolve the complex from the simple. <sup id="cite70"><a href="#fn70">[70]</a></sup> Once initiated, planetary evolution must proceed quite independently of the physical survival of that planet. <sup id="cite71"><a href="#fn71">[71]</a></sup> Process is under perfect control of universe Creators. <sup id="cite72"><a href="#fn72">[72]</a></sup> Evolution process varies greatly but is orderly and controlled. <sup id="cite73"><a href="#fn73">[73]</a></sup> Evolution does not at once produce superlative perfection but rather comparative and advancing practical adjustment. <sup id="cite74"><a href="#fn74">[74]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Progress towards harmonious unity, a growing <a href="/topic/experientials">experiential</a> synthesis superimposed on an ever-increasing complexity of relationships, could be effected only by a purposive and dominant mind. <sup id="cite75"><a href="#fn75">[75]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many groups accepted this story of man’s clay origin by some form of special creation in the place of the earlier beliefs in progressive creation—evolution. <sup id="cite76"><a href="#fn76">[76]</a></sup> Throughout all these millenniums Providence has been working out the plan of progressive evolution. <sup id="cite77"><a href="#fn77">[77]</a></sup> Evolution shows wisdom of Creators. <sup id="cite78"><a href="#fn78">[78]</a></sup> Evolution may be slow, but it is terribly effective. <sup id="cite79"><a href="#fn79">[79]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Master Force Organizers go out into space and mobilize its energies to become gravity responsive to the Paradise pull of the Universal Father; and subsequently there come the Creator Sons, who organize these gravity-responding forces into inhabited universes and therein evolve intelligent creatures who receive unto themselves the spirit of the Paradise Father and subsequently ascend to the Father to become like him in all possible divinity attributes. <sup id="cite80"><a href="#fn80">[80]</a></sup> The ability of animals to adapt themselves to air, water, and land is not a supernatural endowment, but it is a superphysical adjustment. <sup id="cite81"><a href="#fn81">[81]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The creations of the seven superuniverses are finite, evolutionary, and consistently progressive. The creations of the seven superuniverses are finite, evolutionary, and consistently progressive. <sup id="cite82"><a href="#fn82">[82]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Social evolution </h2>
<p>The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal. <sup id="cite83"><a href="#fn83">[83]</a></sup> It is better to reform than destroy religious ritual. <sup id="cite84"><a href="#fn84">[84]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The human baby is born without an <a href="/topic/education">education</a>; therefore man possesses the power, by controlling the educational training of the younger generation, greatly to modify the evolutionary course of civilization. <sup id="cite85"><a href="#fn85">[85]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Caligastia rebellion did not seriously interfere with the progress of organic evolution, it did markedly modify the course of social evolution and of spiritual development. <sup id="cite86"><a href="#fn86">[86]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Celestial evolution is the business of transmuting the potentials of man the temporal into the actuality and divinity of man the eternal, a Paradise finaliter. <sup id="cite87"><a href="#fn87">[87]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The slowness of evolution, of human cultural progress, testifies to the effectiveness of that brake—material inertia—which so efficiently operates to retard dangerous velocities of progress. <sup id="cite88"><a href="#fn88">[88]</a></sup> External restraints of hunger and fear circumscribe subspiritual choice range. <sup id="cite89"><a href="#fn89">[89]</a></sup> Jesus was a progressive evolutionist. <sup id="cite90"><a href="#fn90">[90]</a></sup> Man is gradually backing into the truth, beginning in <a href="/topic/error">error</a>, progressing in error, and finally attaining the threshold of truth. <sup id="cite91"><a href="#fn91">[91]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Social inheritance enables man to stand on the shoulders of all who have preceded him, and who have contributed aught to the sum of culture and knowledge. <sup id="cite92"><a href="#fn92">[92]</a></sup> When physical conditions are ripe, sudden mental evolutions may take place. <sup id="cite93"><a href="#fn93">[93]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many of the essential factors in man’s evolution have been highly expensive, have cost vast treasure in <a href="/topic/effort">effort</a>, sacrifice, and self-denial, but these achievements of self-control were the real rungs on which man climbed civilization’s ascending ladder. <sup id="cite94"><a href="#fn94">[94]</a></sup> In the forests man has always deteriorated; human evolution has made progress only in the open and in the higher latitudes. <sup id="cite95"><a href="#fn95">[95]</a></sup> Society is product of ages of trial and <a href="/topic/error">error</a>. <sup id="cite96"><a href="#fn96">[96]</a></sup> Evolution succeeds where even revelation fails. <sup id="cite97"><a href="#fn97">[97]</a></sup> Superb attainments on settled worlds amply justify evolution. <sup id="cite98"><a href="#fn98">[98]</a></sup> Survival struggles of primitives did not naturally breed trust. <sup id="cite99"><a href="#fn99">[99]</a></sup> Unaided evolution cannot achieve peace on isolated worlds. <sup id="cite100"><a href="#fn100">[100]</a></sup> Evolution yields progress; revolution does not. <sup id="cite101"><a href="#fn101">[101]</a></sup> </p>
