<p>A doctrinal fetish will lead mortal man to betray himself into the clutches of bigotry, fanaticism, superstition, intolerance, and the most atrocious of barbarous cruelties. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> The few denunciations of Jesus were largely directed against pride, cruelty, oppression, and hypocrisy. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the half-civilized man there still lurks an evil brutality which seeks to vent itself upon those who are superior in wisdom and spiritual attainment. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
