<p>The Morontia Companions are simply gracious hosts to those who are just beginning the long inward ascent. Excursion and Reversion Supervisors will accompany us on the longer trips to the headquarters sphere and to the surrounding worlds of transition culture. They plan, conduct, and supervise all such individual and group tours about the system worlds of training and culture. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
