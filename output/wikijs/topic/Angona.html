<p>Angona is the name of a massive solar system made up of a dark giant from space, perhaps a black hole, which 4.5 billion years ago approached our solar system and gave rise to twelve planets and a cloud of meteors by disgorging material from the sun. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It is possible that Angona was part of a large nebula neighboring <a href="/topic/Andronover">Andronover</a> whose approach distorted Andronover as we are told that this distortion occurred at the time of the birth of our solar system. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
