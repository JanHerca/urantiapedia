<p>Too often we engage in a fight merely to convince ourselves that we are not afraid. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Antiquity </h2>
<p>When the early chiefs would try to iron out misunderstandings, they often found it necessary, at least once a year, to permit the tribal stone fights. The clan would divide up into two groups and engage in an all-day battle. And this for no other reason than just the fun of it; they really enjoyed fighting. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Since Eden Garden times play, humor and competitive substitutes for physical fighting were practiced. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Jesus </h2>
<p>Jesus never got into personal combat. Before any attack he <a href="/topic/first">first</a> discriminated if the aggressor was a son of God, and he only applied <a href="/topic/force">force</a> if that person did not possess moral judgment and spiritual reason. But if he were a son of God he would not use force or self-defense against him, and he would try to use any artifice to appease him. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When Jesus defended a slave girl in Crete from a drunken degenerate who was attacking her it is the closest Jesus ever came to a fight with a fellow, but thanks to his strong arms Jesus prevented the incident from escalating into something more. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
