<p>Jesus and Ganid gave first aid to a lad named Rufus, who had been injured by a breakdown. His father, Simon, little dreamed that the man whose <a href="/topic/cross">cross</a> he subsequently bore by orders of a Roman soldier was the stranger who once befriended his son. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Simon was the father of Rufus and Alexander from Cyrene. Both sons became very effective teachers of the new gospel in Africa. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
