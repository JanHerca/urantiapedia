<p>Arius was a priest who at the Council of Nicaea defended the idea of the subordination of the Son, of Jesus, to the Father, and that the words of Jesus did not correspond with the words of God himself. The Urantia Book indicates that his claims might put in danger the truth of Jesus' bestowal. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
