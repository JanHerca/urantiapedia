Ascenders now, for <a href="/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time, attend the “assemblies of Paradise” and hear the story of their far-flung career as it is depicted by the Faithful of Days, the first of the Supreme Trinity-origin Personalities they have met. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
