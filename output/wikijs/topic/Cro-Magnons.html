<p>Cro-Magnon men are the result of the mixing of the Andites of Eden with the higher types of the blue race, combined with the elimination of the inferior strains. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> The Cro-Magnon peoples, the blue race, were a <a href="/topic/courage">brave</a> and farseeing race. They had a familiar spirit and they had an effective system of <a href="/topic/children">child</a> <a href="/topic/culture">culture</a>. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Cro-Magnons were absorbed by Andites from Mesopotamia in a final and en masse invasion swept over Europe. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Cro-Magnons were wiped out by the superior intelligence and ever-augmenting biologic reserves of the white race of Andites. The decisive struggles between the white man and the blue man were fought out in the valley of the Somme. The strongholds of the blue man which persisted longest were in southern France. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Cro-Magnoid blue man constituted the biologic foundation for the modern European races, but they have survived only as absorbed by the later and virile conquerors of their homelands. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There are few evidences of the white man’s early <a href="/topic/culture">culture</a>, although the preceding Cro-Magnon type is well preserved where it has been securely sealed up in <a href="/topic/caves">caves</a> and grottoes. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During the previous hunting era the superior tribes had intermarried with the higher types of war captives and had unvaryingly destroyed those whom they deemed inferior. But then they began to save many of the mediocre captives as slaves for agriculture and interbreeding with slaves deteriorated the race. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
