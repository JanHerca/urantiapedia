<p>In the realms of knowledge, omniscience, we cannot distinguish between the First and Second Sources; like the Father, the Son knows all; he is never surprised by any universe event; he comprehends the <a href="/topic/ends_versus_means">end</a> from the beginning. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>From a circumscribed view there are, indeed, many <a href="/topic/ends_versus_means">ends</a>, many terminations of activities, but from a larger viewpoint on a higher universe level, there are no endings, merely transitions from one phase of development to another. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
