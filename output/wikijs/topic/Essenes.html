<p>Essenes were a mystic Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, originating during the Maccabean revolt. They held possessions in common, something also made by Jesus' apostles. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Their requirements were in some respects more exacting than those of the Pharisees. They had adopted many Persian beliefs and practices, lived as a brotherhood in monasteries, refrained from marriage, and had all things in common. They specialized in teachings about angels. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Many of the Essenes tolerated the theory of reincarnation, that men may reap in one incarnation what they have sown in a previous existence. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
